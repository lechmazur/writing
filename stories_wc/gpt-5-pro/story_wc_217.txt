<story>At the cobalt lagoon after rain, I sit as a quiet shoreline poet in a burnished hush. [17]
I am warmly attentive to every ripple that does not know whether it is sky returning or water staying. [36]
Behind me, gulls practice arguments that only wind understands, and I listen for a way to answer gently. [54]
My small satchel carries paper, twine, and a drake's tail feather, found near the reeds when the storm relented. [73]
I use the feather as a quill, because it curves like a question and takes ink the way mouths take breath. [94]
My reason for coming is simple and stubborn, to discover beauty in the incomplete before someone calls it broken. [113]
I call the poems I gather here woven dawns, because each morning stitches itself to the next across the water. [133]
The lagoon makes a loom, and the light is the shuttle, and the drizzle threads the warp with ash and silver. [154]
Today the air holds stillness like a cup warm from someone's hands, and even the reeds stand listening. [172]
Across the path, a child runs with a red kite patched from grocery bags, a father jogging to keep up. [192]
They angle the kite toward the lagoon, and the wind answers with a tug that smiles against their palms. [211]
I rise because I want to tend the delicate juncture between joy and its first misgiving before it blows away. [231]
The boy whoops as the kite climbs, the father laughs, and the string sings, high and thin like a violinist testing. [252]
Then the gust twists strange, and as a kite string snaps, sound blanks, as if the lagoon clamps its tongue. [272]
The kite somersaults and falls into the reeds, its tail caught, its red a wound bright against the cobalt. [291]
The boy stops, his mouth oval and vulnerable, the father already rehearsing apologies to gravity and cheap twine. [309]
I walk to them with the feather in my hand, a small tool for mending the part that is not torn. [330]
We leave the kite where it lies and listen to the wind, which is ashamed of nothing and never says sorry. [351]
I kneel so the boy's gaze meets mine, and I show him how the string's fray is a kind of music. [372]
It thrums if you pluck it, I say, and the reeds answer, and the puddles give back little circles of agreement. [393]
You can work with this, I tell him, by harmonizing discord until the crooked comes round to a new center. [413]
He nods because the wind has already taught him that straight lines belong to doors, not to clouds or lakes. [433]
The father breathes out, a laugh brushed thin, and asks whether we can save the kite without making it perfect. [453]
We will not repair it like a clock, I say, but we will tend its unruliness until it makes a better song. [475]
I pull the drake's tail feather from my satchel and hand it to the boy, who feels the stiff shine and laughs. [497]
This will not be a quill now, I say; this will be an honest tail that admits the wind's mischief. [517]
We thread the feather into the kite's torn tail with twine, and the father ties a knot that remembers to breathe. [538]
The reed that snagged the craft becomes a mast we borrow for launching, and the boy grips the softened string carefully. [559]
When the wind returns, we do not fight it; we angle the kite so its little brokenness can sip what it needs. [581]
It rises uneven and alive, laughing like a boat with one oar, then steadies because imperfection found a rhythm to lean on. [603]
The boy whoops again, louder, and the father watches him with a gratitude that looks almost like surprise. [621]
I stand in the shallows, trousers dark with spray, and memorize the tilt of their shoulders against the bruised clouds. [641]
This moment will belong to the woven dawns, I think, because it braids patience, wind, and laughter through the same slender eye. [663]
When tomorrow pulls light across the lagoon, the braid will glint, and I will write it as a lesson learned slowly. [684]
Not every cut needs sutures; sometimes it needs a new tail to say where it has been and where it points. [705]
I watch the boy steer, small shoulders squaring when gusts lean on him, and I feel the world lean back kinder. [726]
The reeds begin applause, a ticking of seeds on water, while the gulls abandon their quarrel for a quiet escort. [746]
When the kite finally lands, gentler this time, I tuck the featherless quill away and thank it for its second life. [767]
The father nods to me, and the boy grins, and I offer them the poem already forming on my tongue. [787]</story>
