<story>I arrived at the astral orchard blossoming on a lonely asteroid with brightened disquiet humming in my ribs. [18]
The trees put out leaves of faint aurora, and stones around their trunks glowed like sleepy moons. [35]
I am the bewildered curator of a museum that catalogs things the future refuses to remember. [51]
They sent me here to pursue forbidden knowledge, and I said yes before anyone could offer safer words. [69]
The contract stated the work would happen between the first and last page of a book I had not yet seen. [90]
I found the book nestled among the roots, its cover laced with resin and the memory of orchard wind. [109]
When I opened to the endpapers, a whisper asked whether I had brought the pistachio shell cameo blank. [127]
I had, wrapped in gauze and worry, a small oval made from a half shell smoothed to an expectant shine. [147]
It would take the impression of my future face, they said, because inheritance here does not walk straight. [165]
This orchard cultivates nonlinear inheritance, where fruit travel both forward and sideways, grafting memory upon debt and promise. [183]
I was told to inquire politely, as if I were at a front desk, and never to touch a flower with my bare hands. [207]
The rule sounded simply complicated, a net of common sense and impossible courtesy strung in vacuum. [223]
I began my inventory by breathing slow, then placing the cameo blank on the book so it could learn my outline. [244]
All around, petals edited the air, erasing the dust of meteors and writing it back in more attentive spirals. [263]
I felt watched, not by a hostile eye, but by distant cousins that had yet to be born. [281]
They expected me to choose a branch and thereby choose a past that would lead to me now. [299]
Somewhere in the library of my training, a professor warned that the most dangerous catalog is the self. [317]
I excused myself to the station bathroom, where I always end up having philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms, because the pump noise keeps secrets. [340]
Standing by the mirror with its hairline of frost, I traced possible paths like a cartographer of unborn regrets. [359]
If I took the fruit labeled with my name, some ancestor who had not yet met anyone would suddenly remember me. [380]
If I refused, the book might close, and the orchard would go on blossoming without a witness to map its tender mathematics. [402]
I decided to return and make no choice except attention. [412]
Back under the aurora leaves, I will inquire of the roots, I told the book, which seemed both page and soil. [433]
Ask, it answered, and closed my mouth with the quiet of falling pollen. [446]
Questions had to be shaped as offerings, so I rubbed the cameo blank until my reflected face blurred and widened. [466]
The trees allowed me a single direct question, so I asked what it meant to inherit a future. [484]
They replied with the taste of rain on a summer drought, and with a memory that did not belong to me. [505]
A young woman in an ancient city bent over a ledger, carving my name into a blank where her hope should be. [527]
She was my heir from the past, and I was her ancestor from the future, our lines crossing in the orchard light. [549]
Nonlinear inheritance, the book sighed, is the art of debts that pay themselves by seeking other times to be born. [569]
I stood there full of brightened disquiet, knowing my record would cut both ways unless I found a gentler grammar. [589]
Back in the bathroom, the pump hummed, and I saw a different use for the pistachio shell cameo blank. [608]
Instead of taking an impression of my face, I would press it to the page and capture the breath of the orchard. [630]
When I tried, the shell warmed, and a soft cameo formed, not an image but a map of pollination and patience. [651]
I set the cameo into the cover, and the book opened into itself, revealing a chapter that was also a footpath. [672]
Walking there, I met the young woman from the city and offered her the orchard breath as a third road. [692]
She laughed in surprise, and the ledger pages loosened, and our choices no longer canceled each other like wary strangers. [712]
Now the orchard could keep blooming, simply complicated and honest, while the catalog became a window rather than a trap. [732]
I returned to the clearing and thanked the roots, which answered by lifting a page full of seeds small as commas. [753]
These would imprint only on breath, they said, and would pass their memory without taking anything except attention. [771]
I slipped a seed into the bathroom mirror frame for later, because I still have breakthroughs there when the pumps begin. [792]</story>
