<story>I am an ardent ferry deckhand, trained by tides and ticket stubs to love the in between. [17]
The vanishing commuter ferry is my workplace, my worry, and the only stage where I still believe routine can be heroic. [38]
Each dawn we push off across the estuary and sometimes we are seen arriving, and sometimes we arrive where no eyes are aligned. [61]
The captains call it fog, but I know the schedule stutters when clocks run sideways. [76]
I keep an empty hourglass in my pocket to listen to the stillness between grains that are no longer there. [96]
You can hear a harbor in that silence if your hope is resiliently positive and your fear learns to wear a lifejacket. [118]
Tonight, word comes over the radio that the ferry did not come back for the evening run, though I tied her fast at our pier. [143]
The harbor master speaks calmly, but the channel hisses like snow, and between the crackle I hear my own voice, later than now, calling my name. [169]
He tells me to meet him at the spectral grotto under starlight, the sea cave that appears only when the tide forgets its duties. [193]
I sign off, lock the ticket booth, and row by memory through pilings that remember more hulls than years. [212]
I have wanted this crossing for months, dreaming of a fix to merge parallel timelines so the commuters stop scattering like gulls at fireworks. [236]
I want our ferry to dock in one morning and be there for everyone, including me. [252]
The grotto mouths open between rocks, and starlight threads down through holes in the ceiling as if the sky trawled for souls. [274]
The water glows faintly, a chart of our mistakes and chances, its surface breathing in time with my ribs. [293]
There I find the ferry, not wood or steel but a suggestion of benches and ropes, shimmering with absence. [312]
My other self leans from that specter, another ardent ferry deckhand, older by the shape of new regrets, yet grinning like me. [334]
He tosses me a coil of rope made of echoes and asks if I brought the hourglass. [351]
I show him the empty hourglass, glass clear as gull bones, and he nods the way deckhands nod when storms are friends. [373]
The plan, he explains over both the lapping water and the same channel on our radios, is to weave returns via interconnected patterns. [396]
He points to the star reflections, to ripples, to the faint grid of our city piers, and to the rhythm of footsteps we cannot see. [421]
If we align these moving maps inside the hourglass and radio our captains at the same breath, the ferry will choose a single shore. [445]
There is a risk, he says, that one of us will be chosen instead. [459]
We begin, counting without numbers, because here quantities behave like currents and slip from any grip too hard. [477]
I tip the hourglass between our boats, and the star reflections pour in as if the sky were a sieve. [497]
The glass remains empty, yet fills with patterns, a delicate net where wakes, footsteps, starlight, and radio static knot and unknot. [518]
My other self and I speak together into the mic, our voices braided, calling our captains by name, asking for clearance into one dawn. [542]
The channel replies with every horn the harbor has, long and low, and the cave answers by shifting the stars like a curtain. [565]
We pull the ropes of echoes, and the shimmering benches gain weight, each seat remembering a commuter who deserves to get home once. [588]
In the hourglass, the patterns knit into a single road of light, and I understand the cost written there. [607]
One deckhand must become the hinge, a permanent transient, an open bracket between days, holding the ferry steady while others cross. [628]
I am resiliently positive, and I know my city needs arrivals more than I need a destination, so I nod to myself across the tide. [653]
We release the last knot in the patterns, the hourglass turns without hands, and the ferry takes on the deep shine of yes. [676]
I feel my feet thin into wake, my heart stretch into rope, my name become the gap between whistles. [695]
The other me salutes, boards the newly solid boat, and the commuters gather as if the city finally remembered its limbs. [716]
He radios the harbor master and says, clearly, that the ferry is coming in on time for the first time in months. [738]
Their words pass through me like wind through rigging, yet I hold form, tethered to echoes, counting the inhale of the cave and the exhale of the tide. [766]
The stars slide closed above, and the grotto tucks itself away, but the path remains, humming across me, a bridge made of motion. [789]</story>
