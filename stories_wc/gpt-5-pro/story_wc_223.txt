<story>The city had no ruler, only echoes, and I stepped into the old whispering gallery to hear what power sounded like when it was gone. [25]
It was during an interregnum, a pause so wide the air itself seemed to hesitate before crossing the floor. [44]
Every whisper ran along the curve and returned brighter, as if absence could phosphoresce. [58]
That luminous absence taught me where to stand, which is a kind of authority. [72]
I was the crisis actor real crisis survivor the city did not know what to do with. [89]
In drills I had pretended to bleed; in fire I actually did, and the pretending did not help but it gave me a grammar. [113]
Now I wanted to become the historian of small gestures, because grand speeches collapse quickest and hands remember longer than mouths. [134]
The Custodian met me under the central oculus, benevolently ruthless in a uniform without medals, carrying a chessboard missing all the pawns. [156]
You will need this, she said, and set it on a bench of veined marble. [171]
It is a map of who vanished. [178]
The pawns went first, and there are no replacements in the shops. [190]
She placed a fingertip on the second rank as if soothing a fever that could not be cooled. [208]
Then she pointed at the floor, whose concentric tiles made a quiet alphabet. [221]
Here, she said, the building listens, and we write by feet. [232]
The method is a pattern of walking that spells words, and the words call the stored murmurs down from the crown of the dome. [256]
If you can read them, you can keep the city from forgetting itself. [269]
But you must unbind yourself from the scripts that made you comfortable in false danger. [284]
I nodded, though my wrist still wore the faint ladder of scars where a tourniquet had bit. [301]
The Custodian unhooked the red cord that kept tourists from the precise center, then said my name in the old way, syllables weathered into patience. [326]
Walk BEGIN, she said, and I understood she did not mean the word but the shape. [342]
So I moved heel to toe in lines and diagonals, touching certain tiles to make letters, B, then E, then G, and when I came to I the dome sent back a breath that smelled of iodine and smoke. [381]
Voices followed, not speeches, but little weather reports of living: a kettle clicked off somewhere far away, a child practiced apologies, two lovers rehearsed silence. [406]
I stepped the N and they braided into a ribbon I could touch, and it felt like a sleeve I had once torn to bandage a stranger. [433]
That day, the real day, sirens made a crown for the horizon, and the drills inside me broke like cheap toys. [454]
I thought pretending had prepared me; instead it had staged a room with exits painted on the walls. [472]
After, moving became the only grammar left, and I wandered with the others along the nomadic penumbra cast by agencies that arrived late and left early. [498]
We lived on the edge of permission, in the swing of a door that never decided. [514]
Here, in the gallery, the edge curved into a circle I could learn, and learning tasted like salt on a glass. [535]
The Custodian watched without blinking, benevolently ruthless, pruning my flourishes with a nod or a clipped breath. [552]
You will be tempted to perform, she said, but we only harvest the small. [566]
We do not record fire, we record the fingers that strike the match. [579]
I understood and unbound the red cord entirely, coiling it like a sleeping vein and setting it beside the chessboard. [599]
On its squares I placed pebbles to mark letters I would walk, so the board kept count of the lost while I kept count of the living. [626]
At G, a cough; at I, the scrape of a chair; at N, a laugh that had stayed hidden in a coat for years. [650]
The gallery granted me a ledger of breaths, and I began to see how a city could be rebuilt not from plans but from the choreography of care. [678]
I asked the Custodian what to do with grief too heavy to carry in steps. [693]
She said, teach it to migrate, and she raised her palm to show a small map of calluses that spelled HOME. [714]
So I practiced routes that could travel, words that could walk beside the exhausted, because memory prefers caravans to vaults. [734]
When dusk rose like a tide, I wrote LISTEN and STAY and MEND around the circle, and the dome held them as a lantern holds the idea of fire. [763]
The Custodian nodded once, a permission, and in that nod I recognized both sentence and pardon. [779]</story>
