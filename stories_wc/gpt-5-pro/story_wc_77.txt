<story>After the resuscitation, I returned to the abandoned carnival funhouse, where the air had a repulsive allure. [17]
Rotten peppermint coiled with damp sawdust, and a whispering advisor kept his mouth near my ear without touching. [35]
He never breathed, as if life were a rumor he had decided to deny me out of politeness. [53]
We came back, he said, to trick fear into revealing its weakness, and we would use my curse as bait. [73]
I am photographically cursed; every picture I make refuses my face and prints the hunger of what hunts me. [92]
In my pocket lay the opera cloak clasp, pried from the emcee's cape when the carnival still had a pulse. [112]
It carried a lingering luminance, the sort of patient glow that keeps secrets company long after lights go home. [131]
The whispering advisor taught me through paradoxical notes in a dream dictionary scabbed with grease and glitter. [148]
The notes said, tell the light to hide by shining harder, and tell the mouth to hush by confessing louder. [168]
We passed the laughing mouths painted on the funhouse entrance and entered the mirror maze where my curse felt at home. [189]
The mirrors had grown mold freckles that multiplied my flaws until the reflections looked almost kind. [205]
Set the clasp at the center, he breathed, and ask the room your real name, the name you drowned. [224]
After the resuscitation, my lungs still tasted of river coins, and the paramedic's hands echoed in my ribs. [242]
The whispering advisor was not the paramedic, though; he spoke in the cadence of the ringmaster I once adored. [261]
As a child, I carried his discarded programs and pinned his lost roses in the lining of my coat. [280]
The day the carnival closed, I followed him into the funhouse and found him already breathless beneath the revolving floor. [300]
He thrust the opera cloak clasp into my palm and told me to keep his name safe from the cameras. [320]
But the floor spun, my chest took water, and my own mouth became a lock with no key. [338]
Now, after the resuscitation, I owed the dead their due, and fear owed me its face. [354]
I placed the clasp against a cracked mirror, and the lingering luminance threaded itself through the silver like a patient needle. [375]
A shutter clicked from somewhere, and an old photo booth yawned open, breath smelling of wet paper and pennies. [394]
Unbutton, unbosom, he said, because fear loves a costume, and your bare truth will trick it into dressing itself. [413]
So I told the mirrors the part I had hidden, that I loved the ringmaster more than breath or water. [433]
The confession tasted metallic, like biting a battery, and the booth brightened to a thoughtful, almost forgiving pink. [451]
The paradoxical notes in the dream dictionary said, only a revealed wound can bleed its poison into the waiting film. [471]
I slipped inside the booth, held the clasp to my chest, and let the flash meet my photographically cursed skin. [491]
Fear came quickly, graceful as mildew, drawn by the repulsive allure of exposure and the sweetness of my shame. [510]
It wore the ringmaster's smile but not his warmth, a mannequin mouth flexed by wires and greedy memory. [528]
I set the timer and turned sideways so the mirrors multiplied me into a crowd, then spoke his name into the camera. [550]
The flash flared, and my body refused the print, but the strip filled with the shape of fear leaning close. [570]
It stared at its own outline, puzzled to find nothing inside, because confession had emptied it of blood. [588]
The notes had promised, trap the predator in its footprint, and the print will teach it how to limp. [607]
I slid the glowing strip across the mirror, and the lingering luminance from the clasp threaded through the shadow like stitches. [628]
The shadow tugged, snagged on itself, and then unraveled, leaving only dust and the memory of humid breath. [646]
My whispering advisor grew quiet, as if satisfied with the logic of the trap, and touched nothing, as always. [665]
It was then I realized he had never been a ghost, only the last trick of fear, a faked encore. [685]
I thanked him anyway, and the mirrors returned my gratitude as forty thin smiles I no longer needed. [703]
I pocketed the opera cloak clasp and the printed strip, which had grown warmer, like a tucked animal. [721]
Outside, the midway wind pressed the tent canvas into my back, and the sky promised something ordinary, like weather. [740]
I left the funhouse door open so the lingering luminance could escape, and so whatever came next could find me unafraid. [761]</story>
