<story>Amid the hush of unstruck chords, I stood in water up to my calves, an orchestra pit musician breathing carefully. [20]
Lanterns shook in the draft, their light a trembling score across the flooded opera house lit by flickering lanterns. [39]
I had been lately inspired, and not by applause. [48]
Something here had begun to practice with me, holding notes at the lip of breath, then answering in ripples. [67]
Tonight the stage was dark, rehearsal delayed by flooded corridors and a conductor who could not find his shoes. [86]
The house manager let us wait in the pit, lanterns flickering like indecisive fireflies over water that smelled of rope and varnish. [108]
From the orchestra trunk I had lifted an antique opera program, paper soft as fabric, damp at the corners. [127]
Water damage creating images had bruised the pages into maps that no stagehand would claim. [142]
Faces emerged where cast lists bled; wings and stairwells appeared in the blotches, precise yet impossible. [158]
I held the program across my viola case, and the lanterns spoke in shivers along its creases. [175]
There was a code in the stains, a melody caught in between spaces, the rests where a ghost might leave fingerprints. [196]
When I traced the margins with rosin powder, letters linked the watermarks into a line reading, do not wait for the baton. [218]
I did not laugh, because the air had already pronounced the truth, a wordless conversation running along the rail and bow hair. [240]
The ghost had been rumored ever since a soprano drowned in a burst pipe flood in the forties, when the city thawed too fast. [264]
They said she sang beneath the boards and taught the rats to waltz. [277]
I preferred to think she tuned the spaces between planks, the in between spaces only certain ears could hear. [296]
Lately inspired by an anxiety I could not play away, I had started listening for her during long fermatas. [315]
She answered tonight by smearing the past into pictures. [324]
I angled the antique opera program toward a lantern and watched the stains turn into a balcony diagram with a fracture like a lightning vein. [349]
Then the letters rose again, riding the grain: mezzanine fails at first note, open the north exit. [366]
To unravel the code left by a ghost, I had to accept she thought in music but printed in water. [386]
Around me the others whispered about overtime, shoes, rumors, but I felt the building inhale for the downbeat. [404]
The proper thing was to tell someone, but language seemed as clumsy as wet wood. [419]
She did not want words; she wanted an interruption that would ripple through habit and save a crowded ledge. [438]
I could disrupt the ritual without revealing my panic. [447]
I tightened my bow, slid the program under my shirt to dry, and listened for footsteps returning. [464]
The conductor arrived with damp cuffs and a joke that fell into the lantern light and went out. [482]
He lifted his baton, and the room leaned toward obedience. [492]
Before the downbeat, amid the hush of unstruck chords, I played a harsh harmonic that sliced the air like cracked glass. [513]
A single wrong sound, consummately placed, can realign a theater. [523]
Heads turned, bows hesitated, and the stagehands froze in the wings where the stains had drawn a fracture. [541]
At that pause, a settling groan crossed the mezzanine, subtle as breath but older. [555]
The conductor lowered his hand, undecided, and the house manager shouted for the north exit without knowing why. [573]
Lanterns swept, ropes swung, and a spill of patrons and crew moved toward the cool, high door. [590]
Then a bracket under the mezzanine cracked with a sound I had mistaken for thunder in the pipes, and boards shifted like cards. [613]
Water surged, but the north exit took the crowd like a lung taking night air. [628]
I held the program to my chest and felt it warm like a small animal. [643]
The ghost did not show her face, but her silence mirrored mine and steadied my hands. [659]
When the tremor finished, the lanterns died, and the moon replaced them by sneaking through the broken cornice. [677]
We waited in shallow water and unspoken gratitude until the all-clear came from a fire captain who smelled of rain. [697]
Only then did I open the antique opera program again and watch the stains lose their edges and settle into pale bruises. [719]
The code had moved through me and did not need to be read twice. [733]
I thought of the in between spaces we keep tuning, not notes, not silence, but the merest breath that allows both. [754]
If a ghost lives anywhere, she lives there, and a lately inspired musician can listen long enough to answer. [773]
Tomorrow we will fix the hall, replace lanterns with light, dry the pit, tune the strings, and pretend nothing spoke to us. [795]</story>
