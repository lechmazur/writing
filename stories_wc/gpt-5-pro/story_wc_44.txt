<story>At the nocturnal observatory on a floating isle, I sweep dew from brass rails and read the slow sky. [19]
I am a budding rune scholar, apprenticed to dust, calibration, and the restless math of orbits. [35]
After spoons bend reality, the straight edges lie, compasses sulk, and we chart with rituals that know better. [53]
I came here to find where shadows go at noon. [63]
Everyone else pretends they stop, but I watch the noon sun shear our darkness like a net through water. [82]
A rumor says the answer sleeps in sealed awakenings humming under the floors like a hive of clocks. [100]
My method is quietly deliberate, and my hands remember better than my mind, so I begin by closing loops. [119]
I polish the circular lenses, lace the ring pathways with copper leaf, and finish prayers whose last words are rounds. [139]
Even stories here grow in spirals and return to themselves like moons that refuse to fall. [155]
In a drawer of instruments I find the clockwork automaton key, its teeth sharp as bitten frost. [172]
It belongs to the Archivist, a mechanical steward who has not moved since the last survey of tides. [190]
I wind the key into the ribbed heart of its chest and hear a small consent click. [207]
Gold eyelids shiver open, and the Archivist speaks in the same voice as the old bearings. [223]
You seek the noonward drain of shade, it says, then you must relearn what a shadow really is. [241]
It is a promise not of darkness but of return. [251]
Every noon we pay it back. [257]
The Archivist asks for my intention, and I confess I am here to learn without taking, to witness without theft. [277]
It nods, gears ratcheting like rain, and it leads me down a spiral beside the telescope shaft. [294]
We come to sealed awakenings, a corridor of lacquered pods whose glass is blackened like burned tea. [311]
Names are carved on them, and dates, and equations, but the waking dates end on the day the spoons bent. [331]
The Archivist calls them caretakers of measure who folded themselves into pauses so the isle would not lose altitude. [350]
But the fuel is not their sleep, it whispers, the fuel is their shadows, taken at the exact note of noon. [371]
Each sealed pod is a loop held open with a sliver of absence, and the absence presses upward as buoyant night. [392]
To see where those shadows go, we must not pry, the Archivist warns, we must respect their circuit by closing loops. [413]
So we build a model that eats only its own tail and shows its hunger in small lights. [431]
I scratch a ring of runes on the brass floor and they answer in tiny tides that lick the edge of my boots. [454]
I lay the clockwork automaton key at the center to serve as axis, and I wind it so the model may turn. [476]
The Archivist breathes steam into the ring, and the runes taste it and begin to count. [492]
Minutes roll like coins into a slot, and the loop encloses itself, and then something quiet as an apology arrives. [512]
The light inside the circle turns pale and deep, a bowl of noon that pools with lost silhouettes. [530]
I see drawings of my own future hands, not yet made, reaching from under the world to borrow my outline. [550]
Shadows go to noon to relearn us, to rehearsal rooms where they study how to return as us without error. [570]
They are not waste but teachers who wake us by delay, and their school is a sealed awakening turned inward. [590]
My motive had been to find where shadows go at noon, and now I know they go to keep the isle aloft and us exact. [615]
I do not pull them free from their practice, but I close the ring and thank them, and the model grows clear. [637]
The Archivist records the result, new lines etched on its chest beside the names of those sleeping below. [655]
We make one more loop so the finding binds, a ribbon of copper sealed with wax and breath. [673]
The island steadies, as if the noon wind had decided to stay for tea, and a light weight leaves my ribs. [694]
I return the clockwork automaton key to its hook and let the Archivist fold into patient silence. [711]
A new page waits on the central desk, and I begin to relearn my own craft through what I now refuse to take. [734]
I write that the future will arrive not by shortcut but by closing loops, and that humility is the shortest circle. [755]
I am still a budding rune scholar, but my patience has teeth, and it turns the gears without biting. [774]
When noon comes again, I will welcome my missing edge and trust it to come back with better aim. [793]</story>
