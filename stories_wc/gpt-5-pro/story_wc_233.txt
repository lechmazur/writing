<story>It was after the final warning that the disenchanted queen left her salt glass hall. [15]
The corridors sighed like veils, pretty and perilous, trailing whispers that promised gentle harm. [29]
She carried no torch, only the habit of a softly commanding voice that opened doors. [44]
For months her sleep had been ransacked by recurring dreams of bleeding starlight dripping through stone. [60]
Each dream ended with a hush, as if lace tightened around her throat and smiled. [75]
She set her feet toward the ridge, where the ember grotto kept the old heat of meteors. [92]
The guards watched from arrow slits, relieved to see their queen finally hunt her own haunt. [108]
She had ruled without music since the coronation burned its last sweet lie away. [122]
Disenchanted, they called her, meaning both honest and empty, a cup that refused to glitter. [137]
The path wound among cloud cranberries and bones of lightning that the shepherds used as staffs. [153]
Above, the mountain wore its cobalt grotto like a calm blue pupil staring past the world. [169]
People called it the grotto above clouds, where storms forgot their names and knelt. [183]
The queen meant to climb there, then pass to the ember grotto on the ridge. [198]
She believed the two caves, like lungs, would help her to unravel the mystery of recurring dreams. [215]
At the first ascent she found the mapmaker waiting, a thin man with night weather in his eyes. [233]
He had once charted the chutes that swallowed kings and returned only their crowns. [247]
Your dreams match our oldest contour lines, he said, respectful but not frightened. [260]
She nodded, for his voice tested edges the way rain tests silk, with lacy menace. [275]
Walk with me, she said, and her tone was softly commanding, as if velvet could draw blood. [292]
They moved when the moon thinned, after the final warning had been spoken in the courtyard. [308]
The warning had come from a mirror that refused to reflect her face, only a crack running skyward. [326]
At the treeline the air turned metallic, and the first stars bled a slow blue along the ridge. [344]
She felt old vows stirring like moths in a jar, wanting light and fearing it. [359]
The cobalt grotto received them with a hush that tasted of snow and rust and miles. [375]
Inside, the walls wept a sheen that could not be called water, only bleeding starlight. [390]
The mapmaker lifted a finger and counted ten slow breaths, then did the old method they both remembered. [408]
They made a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer that had wandered up from the orchards. [426]
As their breath left, the grotto brightened, and the bleeding starlight braided itself into a door. [442]
She spoke again, softly commanding, and the door dissolved into a gallery of her own nights. [458]
There she watched herself as child, tracing constellations with ash, while her nurse told stories about mercy. [475]
There she watched herself as bride, smiling through incense, while the court cut promises into silver. [491]
Then she watched the coronation fire swallow a hawk that had brought a treaty from the north. [508]
The north avenged the hawk by piercing the sky with engines, and the wound still bled light. [525]
So her dreams were not curses, but summons, asking her to stitch or to confess. [540]
She laid down her circlet and entered the vaulted chamber where the starlight ran like liquid cloth. [557]
It cut her palms with cold, and the room sang in filigree that weighed like threat. [573]
The mapmaker stood back, a witness, while she lifted the bright wound and pulled its edges together. [590]
But the wound would not close unless she named the fire that had started it. [605]
The fire had been her wedding, and the world had swallowed its smoke and tried to breathe. [622]
I unmake my unmaking, she said, softly commanding her own heart to loosen the crown. [637]
As metal touched stone, the bleeding starlight slowed, then pooled, then rose as a patient mirror. [653]
In it she saw the ember grotto on the ridge exhale a red mist toward the cobalt vault. [671]
Take me there, she told the mapmaker, for the lungs must both learn to breathe again. [687]
They descended with care, feeling the lacy menace of reborn wind curling around their knees. [702]
The ridge burned shyly as if ashamed, and the ember grotto coughed sparks when she approached. [718]
She did not flinch, for lords flinch and fall, but queens enter and teach the dark. [734]
Within the embered ribs she pressed her cut palms to the basalt and whispered the names of birds. [752]
The grotto answered by cooling, and the cobalt grotto above clouds rang once like glass. [767]
Between them a wind began, steady and kind, a breath that would not cost a body. [783]
The mapmaker looked to her for orders, but she simply watched the dusk polish the stones. [799]</story>
