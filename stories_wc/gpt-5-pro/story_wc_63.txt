<story>I am the precise local clock tower winder, paid in coin and trust. [13]
At the height of each tide, I climb with oil, cloth, and certain prayers. [27]
Tonight the air burns my lungs with salt, and the town bell yawns like a throat. [43]
I have been ethically diligent for years, yet the hours still limp across our lives. [58]
Fishermen leave too soon or too late, bargains sour, apologies curdle on tongues. [71]
Something skewed the rhythm, and I carry the wrench for it as others carry grief. [86]
This is my searing reverie and my labor, fused without seam. [97]
I unhook the glass door and let the stairs swallow my boots toward the heart. [112]
The heart is the clock tower pendulum bob, round as a moon, heavy as guilt. [127]
When it swings, the town breathes; when it falters, we lurch into each other with sharp elbows. [144]
I stop the weight, coaxing it into the smallest stillness right before it decides. [158]
During the pause in a pendulum's swing, a different sea opens inside the room. [172]
Time becomes a skin I can lift, a hollowness I can breathe. [184]
In that hush, the tidal obsidian ridge I love appears in the window's black. [198]
The ridge flashes like a cut when the moon tilts, and it carries every lesson I failed. [215]
There my father taught me to rake kelp from the teeth of stone, counting swells, keeping balance. [232]
He cut the rake on basalt and left its end splintered, like a sentence he could not finish. [250]
Years later, after he drowned in a quick spit of weather, the broken handle came back to me. [268]
Along its grain were tiny notches, then minute letters, then whole clauses, as if the wood had kept listening. [287]
It spoke through tiny inscriptions carved along a broken rake handle, a tide ledger, a guilt map. [304]
Names marked next to moon heights, harms scored beside weather shifts, and a last line that trembled. [321]
Forgive by increments, it read, and measure each mercy against what the water can bear. [336]
Here in the tower, I bring the handle to the bob, and the letters seem to emerge like phosphor. [355]
The wood shows me incremental absolution, no choir, no flare, just the steady unburdening with each tick. [372]
To restore shared balance, I must tune weight to truth, not convenience, and make the town feel it. [390]
So I loosen the cap on the bob and find the cavity of shot, dense as a swallowed secret. [409]
For each carved confession on the handle, I take a pellet, hold it to my tongue, and decide. [427]
If the harm was repented and mended, the pellet goes in a jar; if not, it stays to drag us. [447]
I read my own name where the storm took him, and the handle warms like a palm. [464]
I had misread the sky, set nets for sun, and led him to the ridge that cut. [481]
The town forgave me quickly, but I hid in minutes and tightened bolts until my fingers bled. [498]
Now the handle tells me to spare no pellet for my part, not yet, not before I listen. [516]
I listen to the halt of the room and the whisper in the steel, and I weigh sorrow. [534]
I replace three shots and remove two, and the bob feels nearer to the tide's patience. [550]
I press the handle's last clause to my heart and let its carved waves stutter against rib. [567]
Heave for the living, it says, and for the dead, keep time without cruelty. [581]
The ridge gleams from the window, wet with retreating swell, a mirror of my duty. [596]
I fasten the cap, move the nut, and set the bob back to its arc. [611]
In the last breath of stillness, I promise to count even the kindnesses that hurt, as medicine. [628]
The pause exhales, the brass begins its fall, and a slimmer sound enters the town. [643]
Doors will open onto streets like sea lanes, and voices will meet without flinching. [657]
We will emerge from our separate hours as if from coves at low tide, carrying salvage toward the common. [676]
I will visit the ridge when the moon is soft, lay the handle down, and speak his name into spray. [696]
Here, in this town with one tower and a thousand debts, we will forgive by inches instead of lies. [715]
And I, still the precise keeper of our days, will hold to the ethic that steadies the wave. [733]</story>
