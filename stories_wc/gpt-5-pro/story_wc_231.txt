At nautical twilight I stood on the opal dock in mist and watched the lighthouse breathe its tired white lung into the gray. [23]
I was the eccentric lighthouse keeper they named Old Partial for the way I trusted what was missing more than what showed. [45]
The mist made the harbor a page erased and ready for the next hand to write failure or escape or both. [66]
That evening a man staggered along the planks like a clock forgetting its numbers and pressed a dried Edelweiss boutonniere into my palm. [89]
He touched two fingers to his lips, pointed toward the lightroom, and then made a closing motion as if to pocket the night. [112]
He collapsed before I could ask, and the last exhale left his mouth like a foghorn that had lost the will to alarm. [135]
I kept watch over his body until the constable came, and I kept the flower because it had chosen me. [155]
I wanted to decode a stranger's final gesture before the tide erased even his name. [170]
Our harbor learns the living by the gestures they do not finish, and I decided to investigate the one he gave me. [192]
I had always been softly persistent, worrying puzzles the way waves worry pilings, and my trade was to see the darkness between beams. [215]
I pinned the dried Edelweiss boutonniere inside my oilskin as if it might whisper, and at nautical twilight I listened. [235]
Some objects are poor at keeping secrets, and this one lent me borrowed memories the way a neighbor lends a cup with a crack. [259]
A hill wedding bright as ice, a child in wool, a train tunnel that cut a promise in half, a cabin smell of smoke. [283]
The glimpses came blunted, like distant bells through fog, and told me nothing about his last gesture except that it mattered to someone waiting. [307]
I began by observing gaps, because gaps are the letters of the tide and the grammar of people who cannot afford to speak. [330]
His pockets held no papers, but a salt outline on his shirt hinted that something square had ridden long against his heart and been removed. [355]
The harbor ledger showed that a freighter had skipped its customary whistle the past three nights, like a singer dropping a note to mark a count. [381]
I turned the lens to a slow waltz and measured the darkness between flashes, and the absences told me a name by their lengths. [405]
Not what shone, but what failed to shine spelled her, and the flower answered with a thin ache that felt like snow on a bruise. [430]
Edelweiss does not grow by the sea, so its presence was a ferry ticket for a mountain that could not come, and the name was Mira. [456]
He had asked me to send her what he could not carry over water, to encode a message in the gaps and let the light bear it. [483]
The constable wanted reports and destinations and a quick burial, but I kept returning to the opal dock in mist at the same hour. [507]
I adjusted the lantern to speak in pauses and aimed it where the shipping lane shrugged past like a beast that had learned to ignore us. [533]
Each night I lent him my routine and he lent me his hope, and the borrowed memories ripened into instructions as clear as a tide chart. [559]
Three long silences, two short, then one long again, the pattern he had traced in the air before the floor took him down. [582]
On the fourth evening a liner crept through the slate like a whispered apology, and a figure in a shawl stood on the forward deck. [607]
She lifted a hand to her mouth as if steadying a cup, then to her breast, and the light threaded its pauses into her eyes. [632]
She reached into her coat and showed me another dried Edelweiss boutonniere, held it to her mouth, and pointed to the dark like he had. [657]
No salute, no wave, only the acknowledgement that in absence a message had traveled, and that I had served as lantern and harbor both. [681]
The liner faded into open water, and the mist took back the dock, and the only sound was the seam of the world unthreading. [705]
I returned to the lighthouse feeling like a witness who lives in the margins of everyone else, keeper of their borrowed memories and their witnessed isolation. [731]
I cleaned the lens, wound the mechanism, brewed coffee, and told the walls the lighthouse was doing good work. [750]
I placed the boutonniere in a jar of salt to keep it dry, the way fishermen keep bait alive with water that remembers its home. [775]
I knew I would keep signaling after Mira reached port, because some messages are for the carrier as much as the receiver. [797]
