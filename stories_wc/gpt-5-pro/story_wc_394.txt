<story>I run a gears-and-cogs workshop floating on an acid sea, because apparently gravity respects audacity. [15]
My name is Sera Quell, pioneering cart glider, scrapper of our sky-begging age, and merrily allergic to common sense. [34]
I am steadily curious, the sort of fool who writes equations on saltproof napkins while the sea licks the rafters. [54]
Everyone says the acid eats ambition first; mine comes marinated. [64]
What keeps me alive is a yearning algorithm I built from scavenged cams, gut guesses, and the itch behind my teeth. [85]
It predicts which way the winds will flirt and which gears will fail, based on whatever I feel brave enough to want. [107]
Throughout the evolution of my glider, the workshop, and my nerve, the algorithm has learned to lean into impossibility. [126]
Its goal is simple as a thunderhead: to ring a bell no one hears yet. [141]
Legend says the original bell was cast when the ocean first soured, tuned to whatever future ear might arise. [160]
Most folks aim for dinner, not destiny, and I respect their priorities while heading the other way. [177]
The clue arrived as a hunter's arrow tip stamped with a script we do not speak but somehow keep bleeding into. [198]
It had lodged in the rubberized hide of a rain-whale that washed against my dock like a cathedral coughing. [217]
I boiled the tip clean in a kettle that smelled like pickled thunder and set it under my lens. [236]
To transliterate its shark-bite glyphs, I routed light through the images in a kaleidoscope bolted to a gearcase. [254]
Each twist of cogs shuffled the fragments into patterns my brain could read as coordinates, prayers, and insolent math. [273]
The yearning algorithm drank the sequences and hiccuped out a map that dared me not to follow. [290]
I bolted the cart to its spring-wings, kissed the workshop door, and rode the acid drafts like heckle and hymn. [310]
Out there the sea fizzes like gossip, extruding towers of saltglass and chewing any thought that stands too proud. [329]
If reverence means standing quietly, I am bad at it, but awe keeps jumping me in alleyways anyway. [347]
The coordinates led to a spindle of iron rising from the brine, corroded into lace, humming like a bitten lip. [367]
At its summit slouched a bellframe incomplete by one stubborn piece, exactly the shape of my thiefed arrow tip. [386]
The past is so considerate sometimes it leaves a tooth behind. [397]
I slotted the hunter's arrow tip into the throat clamp, and my cart glider trembled like a choir swallowing notes. [417]
The yearning algorithm surged through its springs, tickled the clapper, and rewrote my knuckles into levers. [433]
I pulled, the bell reared, and something rang that sounded like basalt deciding to become a bird. [450]
No one heard, which was the point and the punchline, and also the most unlonely moment of my life. [469]
The acid swells hiccuped in petaled ripples, and a flock of solvents arranged themselves into an alphabet only shadows could spell. [490]
Back at the workshop, gears clicked into a new patience, and the kaleidoscope blossomed a second grammar of directions. [509]
I transliterate again, through the images in a kaleidoscope that now remembers every turn I ever made. [526]
The new map shows a path not forward but inward, a route braided through my missteps, tight and true as string. [547]
It says keep flying, keep failing, keep ringing, and let the hearing grow around the sound throughout the evolution. [566]
I spin my cart glider along the winchlines, irreverently awed by how the world tolerates me enough to bloom. [585]
Every bolt I tighten is a prayer with greasy hands, every slip a chorus, every bruise a draft of scripture. [605]
Do not mistake me for wise; I am a mirror that keeps sneezing until it learns the shape of light. [625]
The bell sleeps now, perhaps dreaming future throats, while the arrow tip sits warm in my pocket like a seed. [645]
When I wake, I taste iron and lemon and the stowaway grin of risk, and the sea tastes me back. [665]
We are kin now, bell and workshop and pilot, spliced by intention and lubricated by laughter that refuses to curtsy. [685]
So I grease the bearings, stoke the algorithm, and aim my nose toward tomorrow like a comet wearing training wheels. [705]
If nobody hears yet, good; it gives me time to practice until the first ear arrives and thinks me obvious. [725]
By then the path will be real, printed in ripples and transliterated in brass, and we will pretend we planned it. [746]</story>
