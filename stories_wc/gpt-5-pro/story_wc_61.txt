<story>I tended the nebula garden where flowers breathed helium and quiet, their roots threaded through star-silt and old tears dried into crystalline grains. [23]
They call me an otherworldly sentimentalist because I keep every echo of what grows and fades, as if grief were pollen to be saved. [47]
I work here to share light without using fire, to pass brightness safely between fragile lives that would char under a careless flame. [70]
Around my neck hangs a calculating machine gear, bronze etched with microscopic constellations, the last relic of a clockwork orrery my ancestors grew flowers by. [95]
Their hands trained mine to read generational patterns, not in pedigrees alone, but in how petals remember winds and how shadows choose where to sleep. [120]
The garden spreads in terraces of vapor, domes of slow lightning, and corridors of suspended pollen that fall like snow but never touch ground at once. [146]
Across the quiet sigh of falling petals, time moves differently, a hush that lengthens each heartbeat until decisions feel both immediate and already remembered. [170]
To navigate the veils, I use sonar pinging through the denser gas, pulses gliding out to map what the eye pretends is empty. [193]
The pings return carrying profiles of translucent moth-whales, seed-pods with listening skins, and the subtle tremor of an approaching stranger riding a hush-spindle. [216]
She arrives during the transit of a dark bloom across our sun-lens, her silhouette braided with small clockworks that glint like cautious comets. [239]
She bows without bowing, in the way pilots do when gravity is borrowed, and asks whether I can teach her how to give light gently. [264]
Her voice carries a troubling serenity, like a lullaby sung at the edge of a crater, calm that knows the cost of every calm before. [289]
She opens her palm to reveal another calculating machine gear, its teeth chewed by ion storms, a keepsake from a family whose gardens burned. [313]
We trade histories, hers of scorch and flight, mine of hushed cultivation, and trace the generational patterns that set us here like grafted branches. [337]
I tell her we never strike matches, we coax starlight through mineral lattices, and we harvest glow from creatures that bloom when sung to. [361]
Together we follow sonar pinging down corridor after corridor, sketching echo-cartography, until the map shows a lagoon of tender darkness waiting to be taught. [385]
We bring out the old orrery, rebuild it around the two gears, and calculate an orbit for a cloud of dust petals to pass the light along. [412]
When the bloom-cloud moves, slowly, it approximates infinity, a spiral of almost-closure repeating itself through scaleless space until rays diffract and soften into drinkable day. [437]
This is transit not for astronomy alone but for hearts, a choreography of shadows that teaches seedlings to bear brightness without learning pain. [460]
The stranger watches, hands on the orrery, and her expression fractures into rain and then reforms, as if entire choices refracted inside her eyes. [484]
She tells me her pilots teach children to outrun fires, but never to share light, and that maybe escape had become their only tradition. [508]
We listen as the petals fall, a soft applause across the quiet sigh of falling petals, and the garden accepts the reconfigured brightness. [531]
Moth-whales breach like muted fountains through the new light, their skins rippling with a script that repeats but never duplicates, proof that patterns can evolve. [556]
I think of my ancestors, each caretaker handing the next a gear and a vow, and wonder if vows can be tuned as delicately as gears. [582]
We adjust the orrery until the twin gears mesh cleanly, their teeth singing a low arithmetic, and the stranger smiles at the sound of numbers becoming weather. [609]
Around us, seeds open with cautious mouths, tasting the tempered day, and I feel the old ache that makes me an otherworldly sentimentalist at last useful. [635]
For a moment the past and the future harmonize, two notes sustained across gas and memory, and the interval between them becomes wide enough to plant trust. [662]
We pledge to keep teaching transit as kindness, to guide shadows deliberately, and to let this new tradition seed itself through whatever skies her people travel. [688]
The sonar pinging fades to a heartbeat tempo, the moth-whales nest, and the orrery ticks a lull that neither extinguishes nor inflames, but holds. [712]
Out in the terraces, long arcades of light approximate infinity again and again, reminding me that even comfort can be perilous if never questioned. [736]
So I place the two gears in a cloth of starlike moss for the next caretaker, a proof that inheritance can mean transmission rather than repetition. [762]
When the stranger departs, her hush-spindle lifts on a column of cooled radiance, and I listen until even the echoes sound harvested, finally capable of nourishing. [788]</story>
