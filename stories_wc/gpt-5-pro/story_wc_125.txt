<story>After the energy beings arrive, the highways learn to hum, and I drift toward the old coast. [17]
I am a drifting roadside poet with pockets of ash and an ear for tender static. [33]
I pull my cart into a terra-cotta grotto under starlight, where the cliffs breathe like shells. [49]
I have come to discover the texture of time, and I am feeling patient enough to listen. [66]
The new visitors taught our lamps to speak, but they left our questions sober. [80]
They arrive in veils of blue geometry, and route messages through the bones of air. [95]
I wait for their hush to thin, and then I begin, as always, by uncovering layers. [111]
I brush dust from a mural, coaxing a whale from clay, its spine a fractured calendar. [127]
In my satchel lies a frayed coil of rope from a prison escape, relic and compass. [143]
The man who used it ran through my village at dawn, trailing breath like torn silk. [159]
He vanished into the scrub, but the rope remained, curled as if listening for its master. [175]
I keep it because it remembers tension, and tension remembers time with an honesty I respect. [191]
I am ethically playful, so I test the world as kindly as I can. [205]
I pattern the sand with the rope, knot to knot, mapping tides to the starpit overhead. [221]
The energy beings hum approval, or maybe that is the sea rehearsing its sleep. [235]
A figure steps from the grotto mouth, and the mural whale shivers in its glaze. [250]
It is the escapee, older and sun-cracked, with wrists still learning the meaning of wind. [265]
He says the prison sits inside a second that refuses to pass, a perfect and merciless moment. [282]
He broke the bars but not the second, and the second keeps breaking him back. [297]
He wants the rope, because it remembers the way out better than his bones do. [312]
The visitors whisper from the cliffs that they can smooth the second if I trade them my map. [330]
They mean the patterned knots, the calendar whale, the little grammar I have been stitching. [345]
Without it, I will travel blind again, a roadside mouth with no salt to taste. [360]
These are impossible choices, and the grotto seems to deepen with each syllable we breathe. [375]
I look at the rope and feel the muscle-memory of flight, and I look at the whale. [392]
I think of a boy I taught to rhyme his hunger into patience on the road. [408]
I think of the energy beings, who refused to take the coins we offered and asked for riddles instead. [427]
I choose to listen harder, because the texture of time lives where choice frays into song. [443]
I ask the visitor to show me their palms, and they answer with interlaced radiances. [458]
I ask the escapee to show me the second, and he opens his mouth like a door. [475]
The grotto fills with a hush so dense the rope straightens, pointing as a diviner points. [491]
Inside that hush, I hear footfalls layered atop each other, the prison marching without moving. [506]
I kneel and add knots between the old ones, not stealing knowledge, but braiding it thinner. [522]
I feed the rope through the whale's clay ribs, so the mural learns the sound of release. [539]
I anchor an end to the escapee's wrist, and when he breathes, the whale breathes too. [555]
The visitors offer to purge the second if I surrender this braid, but I decline with playful ethics. [573]
I tell them I will trade a poem instead, a poem placed where their light keeps time honest. [591]
I whisper the poem into the whale, and the rope shudders, pulling on years like beads. [607]
The second thins, the grotto air rippling as though cooled by an unseen hand. [621]
The escapee breathes through the opening and steps forward, no longer tethered to a perfect pain. [637]
The whale keeps the pattern, clay remembering knot by knot, a witness that does not betray. [653]
The visitors accept the poem, and in return they let the rope keep its bright fatigue. [669]
I stroke the frayed fibers, feeling the texture of time, which is not smooth, but mercifully various. [686]
The escapee asks how I learned this trick, and I tell him it was not a trick. [703]
It was patience with passionate subtlety, and the bravery of not taking anything whole. [717]
We learn by uncovering layers, and we love by letting them remain layered and bright. [732]
The road calls like a conch, and so I press my ear to its spiral future. [748]
I give the escapee bread and a new name, and he gives me a rumor of rain. [765]
When I leave the grotto, the whale keeps watching the stars, and the stars answer back. [781]
The rope rides my shoulder, a mobile sky of knots, and the highways hum again. [796]</story>
