In the alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night, I keep what the world forgets. [15]
I am the scattered memory keeper, shards of people and places drifting my way like pollen. [31]
Here, in the mirror world, our sky refuses dawn and the orchards grow for remedies. [46]
We press sap into tinctures, teach the roots to sing, and bargain with glass for warmth. [62]
There is a mica window at the heart of the greenhouse, paneled like a fragile book. [78]
Each lamina catches breath and makes a mirror thin enough to fold into thread. [92]
I learned to peel it gently and listen for the flicker trapped between its flakes. [107]
Those flickers are beginnings of woven dawns, the last medicine our realm still craves. [121]
To rekindle a dying realm, I must gather them and make a sky of memory. [136]
But I can only gather flickers through forgotten songs, the ones mothers hid in their breath. [152]
Songs are my net; notes catch the names, and names coax the mica to loosen. [167]
When villagers come, they bring a hush and a need, and I carry both carefully. [182]
Their grief knits communities together, a harsh yarn, and I try to soften it with music. [198]
I swaddle their memories in tendril scarves, lay them beneath curing lamps, and hum the old scales. [215]
The greenhouse answers with a tremble like frost shrugging from glass. [226]
Branches angle toward the mica window, sap brightening, fruits exhaling cold sugar into the hour. [241]
Their skins are stamped with familiar streets, eyes, kitchens, and winter kitchens within winter. [255]
I slice one open and the room fills with bicycle bells and a woman laughing beside sulfur. [272]
The laugh is gold; it coats my tongue, and the mica window shivers, yearning. [286]
I sing her forgotten lullaby, the one that braided streetlights with rain on laundry lines. [301]
The flakes lift, a bright hoarfrost unbuttoning, and threads of dawn slip free into my hands. [317]
I weave them on the trellis, warping vine to vine, my fingers a shuttle of ache. [333]
Woven dawns look fragile at first, a gauze that remembers each voice as color. [347]
When I stretch them toward the ceiling, the greenhouse glows and the endless night loosens its jaw. [364]
Release trembles inside the bind, a bound release that holds us while letting light through. [379]
I learned that tension from a cracked pane, the day the mica window failed. [393]
A storm of breath broke against it, heavy with prayers I had not yet remembered. [408]
The greenhouse darkened, and the trees curled into themselves, like fists learning gentleness too late. [423]
Since then I have carried a line of fear, as thin and cutting as mica. [438]
Fear keeps time; it reminds me that woven dawns must be tight enough to survive sorrow. [454]
Tonight the last village waits, their fires gone to salt, their hearths dreaming ash. [468]
They stand beyond the greenhouse, faces bright with frost, palms pressed to broken glass. [482]
I open the doors and smell old seaweed and gun oil, a history of flight reversed. [498]
I begin their song with a child scolding thunder for waking his sleeping dog. [512]
The parents answer with bread rhythms, the tapping they used to find warmth inside scarcity. [527]
Grandmothers hum the whistle of kettles that never boiled, and grandfathers murmur names of lost stones. [543]
The orchard listens, roots braiding faster; these low notes knit communities together across the shivering paths. [559]
The mica window rises on its hinge like a moon, half broken, half brave. [573]
Flakes separate without shattering, and dawn threads spume out like rivers tasting day. [586]
I catch them, swaddle them in the shawl of our song, and begin the loomwork. [601]
My hands shake, yet the pattern holds, lattice by lattice, across the wet breath of night. [617]
The cloth climbs the rafters, drapes the trees, and spills outward over the waiting village. [632]
They feel it first as warmth inside their ribs, then as color returning to names. [647]
Streets remember their corners; the well remembers depth; the salt remembers a sea worth holding. [662]
I step outside and raise the woven dawn toward the sky that has forgotten its work. [678]
It wrinkles, resists, then drinks every thread, and the horizon shakes off its winter cowl. [693]
Dawn does not blaze; it unknots, fibers loosening from bruise to blush to simple light. [708]
I feel the realm take a breath, a long inhalation that gathers me with it. [723]
My scattered memories fly toward their owners, a murmuration of sparks stitching hearth to hearth. [738]
I am emptied and full, bound to their recovered days, released from the ache of holding. [754]
In the greenhouse, buds open like eyes that finally trust, and the mica window rests. [769]
Its cracks are threads now, proof that breaking can be a seam for light to return. [785]
We stand beneath the radiance and listen for what remains forgotten, ready to sing again. [800]
