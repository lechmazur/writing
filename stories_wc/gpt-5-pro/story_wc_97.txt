<story>I am the wistful station pianist, keeping time that refuses to keep me. [13]
My bench wobbles, and the tracks hum in broken thirds like a promise cut short. [28]
Beside the coin jar sits a broken anniversary clock, its glass dome crazed with hairline rivers. [44]
It stopped the moment Mara's train did not. [52]
Since then, I practice a steely longing, neither brittle nor yielding, carved into each diminuendo. [67]
I play until the horizon invites night, because darkness signs the staff where memory breathes. [82]
The station has compasses in its bones, old ceiling fans that click like flickering compasses, pointing nowhere and everywhere. [101]
I watch their shivering needles and imagine routes that never make the schedule. [114]
Call it strategically creative, the way I map mornings as if they were chords waiting for resolve. [131]
That habit saved me when the reel arrived, in a canister as dented as a tin moon. [148]
Mara had worked in the projection booth, whispering that stories could be doors if you listened for the splice. [167]
Inside the canister lay strips of black-and-white, leader curled like a sleeping centipede around something small and brass. [185]
It was the minute hand from the broken anniversary clock, filed thin where a jeweler never would. [202]
I set it into the sprockets as if into a metronome, and the film showed me what the station concealed. [222]
There were hidden sections in a black-and-white film reel, frames between frames, like breaths between sobs. [238]
Passages, Mara might have named them, threaded with stamps from other stations, other skies. [252]
I slipped the reel over the projector's old jaw, and the ceiling unscrolled into a tidal arbor above the clouds. [272]
Branches of surf laced themselves into bowers, and gulls swam through the vapor as if it were water woven thin. [292]
I heard the stall and suck of tides, not below but around, and the station's pillars bent like mastheads. [311]
There, at the arbor's heart, lay a bench of salt-bleached wood shaped to my back and to her absence. [330]
I took refuge upon it the way seabirds tuck their faces under wing when storms gnash the horizon. [348]
But I was not there to sleep; I was there to tune the air to a promise neither of us had kept. [370]
The flickering compasses gathered like moths, their needles stuttering, quivering toward a point beyond north. [385]
I set the minute hand between two slats of the bench, and it vibrated until sound turned liquid. [403]
Music spilled out, not from keys but from the grain, like tide echoing in a shell vault. [420]
It was the prelude I had never dared to finish in the station, the one that asked for two hands and forgiveness. [442]
Mara's name threaded the melody, a bright stitch through the darker cloth, and the arbor swayed in time. [460]
I remembered our quarrel, voices like steel rails, my pride the locomotive that would not brake. [476]
Her last glance was a departure board in storm, all letters flipping too fast to make a word land. [495]
And then the message that her train had been delayed in a fog unscheduled by forecast or God. [513]
I am not fool enough to crush causality under song, but I have always wanted to surprise fate with an unplanned encore. [535]
In the arbor, the math of tides listened, and the compasses steadied, as if the piece could retune the hour. [555]
I played until the horizon invited night again, and the black-and-white frames began to smolder with light. [572]
Between two beats, the hidden sections opened, revealing a corridor of platform ghosts walking toward me without sound. [590]
Mara was among them, not translucent but colorless, a sketch waiting for the reel to ink her back to breath. [610]
She paused at the arbor's lip, eyes reflecting the compasses, and the minute hand trembled like a trapped lark. [629]
I held out the broken anniversary clock, its face cracked into twelve uncertain countries, and asked for time. [647]
The arbor leaned, sending a whispering surge across the planks, and in that sway she stepped into warmth. [665]
Color returned to her like dawn cresting behind fog, and we laughed the way lost things laugh when remembered. [684]
I asked if she had blamed me, and she said blame was a timetable we no longer had to read. [704]
We sat on the bench while the music sank into quiet, and the compasses, now still, lay down like tired swallows. [725]
I did not ask what price the corridor had demanded, because some currencies ruin what they buy. [742]
Instead, I wound the clock though it was broken, persuading its heart to tick four beats before silence. [760]
Those beats were enough to notch the night, and the arbor opened a path back down to the station. [779]
We returned through hidden sections in a black-and-white film reel, as if surf could learn to speak in cinders. [798]</story>
