<story>The city holds its breath at the hush just before a condemned building is demolished. [15]
Inside, I stand in a tree trunk library hollowed by a scholar's guild. [28]
Dust drifts like pollen, and the air is a held chord. [39]
I am a face blind portrait artist whose only clear desire is to mirror the sky inside walls. [57]
I came here to finish a final work before the sirens break the stillness. [71]
The guild elders told me a secret book safe survived behind the chemistry shelves. [85]
They said it guarded a coin older than the city, and a plan. [98]
I move in heightened stillness, my steps mapping memory rather than sight of faces. [112]
I never remember who has eyes like rain; I remember the way ceilings breathe. [126]
Portraits become skies for me, mapped by folds in plaster and migrating cracks. [139]
To finish this room, I need the code that once lived in the coin. [153]
The guild whispered that the map can be read through faint indentations on a centuries-old coin. [169]
I find the secret book safe disguised as a botanical index of mosses. [182]
Its spine shudders when I tug, and the false pages release a nested tin. [196]
The coin is there, dulled to shadow, smaller than a thumbnail, heavy as a seed. [211]
The coin face is worn, but its valleys hold a pattern of wandering stars. [225]
I press paper and graphite over it and begin to craft the transfer. [238]
Graphite dust blooms like night under my fingers, as lines emerge fractally precise. [251]
The pattern echoes growth rings of this tree and the streets that strangled it. [265]
It is a map and a timepiece, a portrait that refuses any face. [278]
I pin the rubbing to the wall and find coordinates hidden in the recursive coils. [293]
Each spiral points toward a beam, a hinge, a seam where sky could leak through. [308]
I mix lime and indigo and the gray that lives in breath before thunder. [322]
Every stroke finds the wall's pulse; I listen for the limits inside stone. [335]
Discovering limits is my craft and my curse, my solace and my compass. [348]
Face blind, I misplace people, but I never misplace a boundary's fade. [360]
The coin taught me the sky is not above but within, layered and folded. [374]
I paint the east wall the way morning steps across a lake at winter. [388]
I paint the west wall the way the last light keeps a secret, then yields. [403]
Between them, a ceiling grows into a bowl that remembers ancient pollen and smoke. [417]
The library's books breathe in the wet lime, their spines swelling like tides. [430]
Somewhere outside, a crane coughs and stalls; the hush deepens like a held oath. [444]
I fix gold dust where the rubbing told me a constellation hides behind plaster. [458]
The coin's faint indentations become stars that move when the reader steps. [470]
Motion animates sky on the walls, and the room learns to exhale. [482]
I am not saving the building; I am giving it a face I can know. [497]
What I cannot hold of people I hold of rooms and weather and ash. [511]
A child's drawing peeks from under a shelf, a sun with arms, labeled Dad. [525]
I never saw my father's face after the accident; it became a blank noon. [539]
Maybe that is why I vowed to mirror the sky inside walls for strangers. [553]
In the coin map I find a small cross, not of faith but of intersection. [568]
The crossing sits where the trunk widens, where the guild carved its first shelf. [582]
I touch the wood, warm despite the cold, and listen to sap that is memory. [597]
The tree agrees to remember one more sky if I speak gently and true. [611]
I whisper names I cannot picture and paint the hush that held them. [624]
The siren tests its throat, a wavering note that does not yet become sound. [638]
I quicken without hurriedness, because haste fractures the sky and ruins scale. [650]
Fractally precise, the last lines lace the corners with tiny migrating birds. [662]
Each bird is a brush flick, each flick a life, each life a limit. [676]
Outside, the crew waits, counting, careful, because falling is a science of respect. [689]
Inside, the room births itself into a place that can hold more than rubble. [703]
The secret book safe lies open like a mouth that has finally finished a letter. [718]
I leave the coin beneath the tin, a seed returned to its careful soil. [732]
I write a note for whoever walks here later, maybe only in memory. [745]
It says, Stand here and breathe; let the ceiling tell you where you are. [759]
It says, The sky is not far, and it will not forget you. [772]
I step back and watch the walls draw a horizon where none is expected. [786]
The library is no longer a room but a portrait of days before faces. [800]</story>
