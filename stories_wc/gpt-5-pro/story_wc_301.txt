<story>I call myself a truth-seeking river chronicler, which sounds grand until you see the mud under my thumbnails and the mildew in my notes. [24]
After stopping the medication, I came back to the disused railway station overgrown with ivy to face what I had rewritten as nature. [47]
I had mapped the flood wrong, then hid the doubt inside jargon, and a boy I loved as a brother disappeared into the culvert we ignored. [73]
Now my motive was simple and heavy, to find a path to self-forgiveness that did not let me wriggle out of the truth. [96]
The station smelled like wet coins and nettles, and the tracks flashed with mica like dragon teeth sunk in abandoned gums. [117]
Across the platform a busker leaned into an accordion, its bellows patched with tape that caught the light like river scale. [138]
Each wheeze sounded like the culvert breathing, a tired lung lifting the town on dull exhale and dropping it on the inhale. [160]
I told him I was here for records, and he nodded as if I had asked for absolution, and kept playing the river in clumsy chords. [186]
Inside the waiting room I unrolled the county atlas where my past self had penciled map references like a proud scout earning ghost badges. [210]
I labeled the bench as Datum A, the ticket window as North Wall, the crack under the clock as Water Level 1986, daringly methodical to keep panic away. [238]
The simplest story is the one I refused for years: I sketched beauty where a warning belonged, and a flood took him. [260]
The station bathroom had survived behind a swollen door, and I shouldered it open and met the cracked mirror with my old face. [283]
The stalls were a ledger of strangers who had named their aches and coordinates, and I began to triangulate through bathroom graffiti wisdom. [306]
Some lines allude to lovers and lost dogs, but one in the corner scrawled beside a crude fish said, follow the pipes to where the river coughs. [333]
Another hand had sketched arrows with the letters WSP and a date older than my shame, and my map references trembled into alignment. [356]
WSP was Water Service Portal, the square of metal by the freight gate, the one I once labeled irrelevant because romance reads better than rust. [381]
The busker followed me outside, still pressing sorrow out of his accordion, bellows patched with tape breathing like a stitched animal determined to live. [405]
We pried the portal with my screwdriver, and rusty air came up like a confession clearing its throat, and down below the water shivered. [429]
I whispered the boy's name, loud enough for me, and then I began the work I had not done, admitting cause, naming flow, listening. [453]
I traced how trash and willow roots knitted the grate, how my rosy article had lured volunteers away from the ugliest choke point, and I wrote it down. [481]
The busker stopped playing and crouched beside me, and in the quiet we could hear the culvert cough, then swallow, then cough again. [504]
My hands remembered the boy's shoulders as if memory were a rope, and that pain pulled me into the present, steadying me on a narrow beam. [530]
Daring does not require recklessness, I told myself, and my daringly methodical fingers cleared the clog one twig, one rag, one stone at a time. [555]
The water took the gift and shortened its breath, and somewhere downstream a slick of light widened as if a rib cage had flexed. [579]
I wrote a confession in the atlas margins, not to allude, but to state: I drafted a fable and a child paid for its beauty. [604]
I added names of helpers, cities, dates, and cross-hatched lines to the culvert and its portals, so the pattern of blame matched the pattern of water. [630]
The busker closed his instrument, accordion bellows patched with tape silent now, and he took off his cap as if we were standing at a grave. [656]
He did not absolve me, and I did not ask; his eyes said, tell the town, fix the note, keep the gate cleared, and carry the chord until it is not yours alone. [689]
In that raw solace we stood while ivy clicked in the breeze, and I decided that my chronicles would be as blunt as river stones. [714]
I would learn to write toward self-forgiveness by doing the unglamorous maintenance, and by speaking whatever the current carried, especially when it stained my name. [739]
As the light fell, I sealed the portal and left chalk notes for the city crew with map references and a sketch that made no promises beyond truth. [767]
On the platform the busker lifted the accordion again, and the repaired bellows sighed like a lung relearning its size, and I answered its measure with my own. [795]</story>
