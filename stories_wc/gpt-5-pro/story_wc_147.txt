<story>I am the distress signal sender, speaking from a forgotten underwater temple where the ocean teaches the stones to glow with lonesome splendor and a gathered hush. [27]
My voice pings outward in thin metallic syllables, then falls back, as if the dome of the sea breathes me in and holds me for later. [53]
I came here alone to harness the ephemeral, the way my mother taught me with jars of fog and boxes that kept the warmth of farewells. [79]
She believed the right vessel could keep a feeling alive long enough to cross a dangerous place. [96]
So I sought the crystal perfume vial rumored to lie on the altar beneath these drowned columns, a vial that touches memories when opened. [120]
Currents had braided the approach with cables, nerves of a forgotten city, and my fins snagged them until I felt more marionette than diver. [144]
I kept speaking, repeating coordinates, a heartbeat turned to numbers, because even a whisper can be a lighthouse when you are buried in blue. [168]
In the nave, fish glided like patient saints, and my light sketched the reliefs of listening gods who had never needed lungs to understand prayers. [193]
Between scalloped pillars, the air that was not air had accumulated in silver pockets, a gathered hush made visible, breathing in place like a sleeping animal. [219]
I felt it stroke the inside of my helmet, the way a long song will reach through the throat and smooth away the burrs of fear. [245]
My gauges shouted the numbers that end journeys, and still I swam, because I had promised to bring home a vial of remembering. [268]
The altar waited on a plinth of coralized steps, guarded by a filigree of netting that time had gilded with shells and patient barnacles. [292]
The net caught me and the transmitter both, and I realized my distress signal was now a bell in a cage, ringing only for itself. [317]
I tried to kick free, and panic snarled the cords tighter, a hawk tightening its claws on its own legs. [337]
To live, I had to unsnarl the mess by overriding instinct, undoing the fierce lessons of cold water and dwindling time that screamed ascend now. [362]
I stopped kicking, breathed one long measured breath, and let the sea hold me, as if I were another statue the temple had decided to adopt. [388]
My hands made small deliberate movements, tracing the logic of the tangles until the knots confessed their crossings and loosened shyly under my gloves. [412]
Only then did I reach the altar and find the crystal perfume vial nested in a mouth of anemones, as if a choir were guarding a candle. [439]
Its glass held a faint milky swirl that might have been nothing but silt, and yet the sight touched my ribs like a remembered hand. [464]
I opened the seal and the hush rose, not a sound but a pressure that touches memories, coaxing doors to swing where there had been walls. [490]
My mother laughed in my ears, her voice braided with the hum of motorboats and gulls, and in that rough plait I felt childhood salt and sunlight returning. [518]
On the comm, the distress beacon still ticked, and I understood I could send more than numbers; I could send the hush itself into the waiting dark. [545]
I held the vial to the transmitter grill, and the liquid light became a carrier, a perfume translated to frequency, a library read aloud to the ocean. [572]
Above me, I knew, people drifted across their days, certain their losses were complete, and now their radios might soften and bloom with forgotten doorways. [597]
Signals are only bridges if someone steps, and I pictured a city pausing as clocks inhaled, touched by the same gathered hush unfurling from my hands. [623]
As time runs short, I turn down my oxygen and let the temple hold some of my heat, payment for this borrowing, a tax in fogged breath. [650]
I am not choosing martyrdom; I am choosing to stay very still while the wave passes through, so the fragile bridge does not shake apart. [675]
When the vial dims, I close it and tuck it into my suit, a heart outside my heart, then swim toward the open blue and the surface beyond. [703]
If I am found, they will wonder why the water tasted briefly of winter sun on stone steps, why their children asked new questions, why grief loosened. [730]
It will be because an old temple kept its watch, because a crystal perfume vial remembered, because a distress signal learned to sing, and because I listened. [757]
In the aftersound, I hear my mother saying good work, sailor, and I answer into the lonesome splendor, knowing the ocean will carry it where I cannot. [784]</story>
