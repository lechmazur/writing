<story>In the suspended palace anchored to giant stalactites, the air trembled with gears and prayers, and my bones echoed. [19]
I was a bedraggled prince, oil-stained at the cuffs, and my name mattered less than the humming engines. [37]
All my life I had knelt before metal, but I knelt now because the floor shook like a heart learning. [57]
Our ancestors promised ascension when they hung the court from the cave vaults, yet we dangled like pocket watches. [76]
My kingdom whispered that a flawless beginning had soldered us here, but every hinge groaned a confession of flawed genesis. [96]
I moved in a quaking reverie, a waking dream punctured by piston sighs and the occasional fall of lime dust. [116]
To reawaken beauty in a mechanical world became the whisper I did not dare tell the dynamos or servants. [135]
My method, if it could be called a method, was simply hypothesizing about everything until the clatter admitted quiet. [154]
I traced patterns in condensation, mapped tremors with chalk, and compared the arias of steam to the sermons of stone. [174]
Through a grate behind the Throne of Bearings, I found a cabinet abandoned by the old ornithomancers and cartwrights. [193]
Inside lay an extinct bird's egg, the shell veined like frost, warm as a moth caught between pages of scripture. [213]
Its weight tilted my palm toward the abyss, as if the future tugged the wrist like a patient teacher. [232]
I fled to my quarters, where the ceiling hung low and the chains creaked a lullaby almost bitterly sweet. [251]
There I began to assemble a cradle of brass ribs, mica windows, and cloth stolen from my mother's winter cloak. [271]
I scavenged a pilot light from the kitchen furnaces, and I tuned it with spoons to breathe in measured sighs. [291]
While I worked, the egg listened, or I pretended it listened, as I told it the names of vanished winds. [311]
I told it how the first engines rose from water tables like lilies, a coronation nobody believed was theft. [330]
I told it how every blossom afterward carried a gear under the petals, and we celebrated the ticking as time. [350]
But the song of oil has harmonies that gnaw, and in the gnawing I heard the crackle of our origin. [370]
Missives began arriving from the Keepers of Calibration, demanding the egg be turned to the Treasury of Specimens. [388]
They had plans for everything except mercy, and our laws forbade beauty unless it furthered the schedule of bells. [407]
I refused, because refusal was the only prayer I had left that did not use a spring as scripture. [426]
The palace rocked as if the stalactites hiccuped, and I steadied the cradle while my heart clattered like panicked cutlery. [446]
Through the discovery of heat enough to mimic breath, I understood breath is not enough when the lungs are manufactured. [466]
The egg quickened unevenly, tapping a code that felt like apology, and I answered with the names of rivers. [485]
In the tapping I heard the ledger of our house, the hush where a newborn should wail, the missing midwife. [505]
We had been born from engines, crowned by an absence, a parade of brass pretending to be the god of light. [526]
This was our flawed genesis, the lie that the first bird chose the cage, and we inherited its obedient bones. [546]
When the egg finally split, it revealed a shimmer of membranes, and under them a lattice of delicate springs. [565]
A hatchling emerged, not wholly metal, not wholly meat, the compromise my sleepless dreaming had signed without my knowledge. [584]
Its eyes mirrored the embers, and its throat filled with a sound like rain rehearsing on a skylight of bone. [604]
It sang, and the notes went hunting for old dust, and every chain on the ceiling learned to applaud softly. [624]
I understood then that beauty could repair nothing, yet it could name every fracture until the fractures formed a map. [644]
With the hatchling perched on my wrist, I walked the bridges, and the court stared as if remembering a lost vowel. [665]
The Keepers came with clamps and laws, but the bird's voice threaded their helmets and tuned their anger into silence. [685]
I promised them no rebellion, only a recalibration, and I offered the song as the metronome our world lacked. [704]
The palace seemed to lower its shoulders, the stalactites less like teeth, more like roots remembering the patience of earth. [724]
I could not claim victory, because the hatchling bore the same compromise as me, and compromise is merely survival with music. [745]
Yet when morning limped along the chains, the world wore a new shiver, and my reverie steadied enough to kneel. [765]
We would move forward through the discovery, tending the cracked cradle we called a palace, teaching our song to breathe onwards. [786]</story>
