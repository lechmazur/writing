<story>I am a broken mask restorer in a coastal town no map dares to draw. [15]
At night I work inside a prism sanctuary under starlight, where even breath accumulates silence. [30]
Glass ribs arc above me, refracting the moon into patient geometry and lucid unrest. [44]
I was hired, if that is the word, to ground restless spirits who forget they no longer drown. [62]
They press against the facets like water against harbor walls, whispering through the interlaced hush. [77]
Their voices arrive like nets you cannot see until your hands are already snagged. [91]
I keep a tapestry needle in a case of rain-dark wood, small as a thorn and stubborn as tide. [110]
It was my grandmother's, an heirloom from the years when mending was a kind of map. [126]
Tonight an old fisherman waits, his mask shattered by time and worry and salt that never quite dries. [144]
His daughter brings the pieces in a sack that smells of kelp and coins. [158]
She has the eyes of the sea at noon and the hands of someone who has been waiting. [176]
We speak softly because the sanctuary listens, and what it gathers becomes gravity. [189]
Its light accumulates silence the way a shore accumulates shells, shaping and shaped by the tide. [205]
I tell the daughter that her father's spirit is restless because he was never properly moored. [221]
There is a coffer under the quartz floor, a reliquary of hooks and names tied to the deep. [239]
We must exhume what binds him, by unraveling knots in a centuries-old fisherman's net. [253]
The net hangs above the coffer like a topographical cloud, each knot a coordinate on lost waters. [270]
When I touch it with the needle, the threads cool as if remembering winter. [284]
The daughter stands at the threshold, and we mark our time across sharing a secret. [299]
Her secret is a fear that he left angry; mine is that I sometimes see my own face in the broken ones. [321]
The first knot undoes like a breath released, and the sanctuary tilts to listen. [335]
Glass prismatic bones scatter a ribbon of starfire onto the floor, and sand begins to stir. [351]
I work slowly, not to wake what should rise in a hush, threading the needle under each stubborn loop. [370]
Every knot holds a grain of his life, an argument, a promise, a tide chart folded into habit. [388]
As the knots loosen, the net sighs, and the coffer below lifts as if unmoored from centuries. [405]
We are exhuming him without a shovel, without a spade, only a patient line of untyings. [421]
With each unfastened knot the interlaced hush grows, a braid of quiet that drapes our shoulders. [437]
It is not absence; it is presence so careful that sound forgets how to fall. [452]
The daughter comes closer, hands out, palms up, as if balancing invisible bowls. [465]
I place a loose knot across her fingers and ask her to hold it steady while I pass the needle through. [486]
She trembles, but the tremor is a kind of music, the kind a lost boat hears and follows home. [505]
We unmake the last stubborn knot together, and the coffer rises out of the sand with a wet sigh. [524]
It is half barnacle and half story, full of hooks, a dented compass, and shards of painted masks. [542]
I lift a shard that matches his brow and fit it to the broken mask on my bench. [560]
The glass around us hums, and the sanctuary, satisfied, lets its silence shift into gravity again. [576]
I press the wet compass into the coffer's silt and speak the name that had hidden inside the knots. [595]
The daughter repeats it, and the sound lands like a plumb, grounding what was once frantic light. [612]
We bury the coffer again beneath the prism bones, now emptied of its demand, its maps unknotted. [629]
He will not drag at her sleep anymore; he can rest where the tides and stone agree. [646]
In exchange, I ask for the sack he came in, because every binding wants a new promise. [663]
She gives it, and before she leaves she touches the shard now whole and says thank you. [680]
Thank you is a tide that returns in its own way, and it leaves the floor shining. [697]
After she goes, I close the case of the tapestry needle and listen to what still hums. [714]
The sanctuary accumulates silence again, but it is different, braided with the shape of a father's laugh. [731]
Lucid unrest remains, a clear ripple under the skin of night, reminding me there is more to unmoor. [749]
I sit with it, a precise unease, and wait for the next mask to find my hand. [766]
The stars lean closer to the prisms, and the interlaced hush turns a page we have earned. [783]</story>
