<story>The canyon wore a forged hush, as if silence had been hammered on an anvil and hung between cliffs. [19]
We lived among towers of bone in a canyon of endless echoes, and every whisper returned with more moods than we had sent. [42]
I was the defiant artist the elders pretended not to hear, though my paint bled down the ribs of the cliffs like a confession nobody had ordered. [69]
They were saving their attention for the pale spire in mist that rose at the canyon mouth, where the rite would be decided. [92]
We were all countable to the spire, as sheep are to a butcher, and it watched with a blind gentleness that terrified me. [115]
Before the ritual, they said, there must be quiet and a single story, so forgiveness could find its price and its purchase. [137]
But a single story had already killed my sister, and I had learned how many graves could be dug by certainty. [158]
Her laugh used to slide up the bones like a lark, innocently mischievous, and then vanish into the high air where the spire pretended it could not follow. [186]
When they called her guilty for an accident, the price of forgiveness was to carry stones to the spire until her back cracked, and she did not survive the penance. [216]
Now the elders sought another confession to pay for the next flood of absolution, and I had a different idea of price. [238]
I wanted to refract a single truth into many, and I had learned how to do it through impromptu poetry sessions. [259]
Poems thrown into the air here became prisms made of breath and bone, reframing their own meanings as echoes rubbed against the towers. [282]
A verse about a bird would return as a question about cages, then a rumor about broken ladders, then a lullaby that remembered teeth. [306]
If the spire demanded a single story, we would teach the canyon to multiply it. [321]
People came one by one at dusk, faces chalked so the mist would not steal their names, and I led them in silly rhymes that opened like trapdoors. [349]
I clapped, they answered, the bones answered us back, and what began as play turned into a weave of possible versions of what happened to my sister. [376]
There was the wind that could have pushed, the slick algae someone might have left, the guard who leaned too long, the decree that hurried a child, the spire that asked no questions. [409]
Each version was a shard of our shared mirror, painful to hold, truer together than the clean lie that had buried her. [431]
The canyon taught us that meaning could refract, and we learned to hear the many as one long chord rather than a quarrel. [454]
We met every night before the ritual, until even the children could lace a joke with a knife and smile as the echo stole the blade. [480]
My mischief was a signal flag, innocently mischievous but lit by a stubborn anger, because innocence can be defiance when the cost is silence. [504]
I wanted to change the price of forgiveness not by refusing it but by making it impossible to pay with just one voice. [527]
Let the price be listening to all of us, I thought, or let there be no buying of our grief at all. [549]
The night before the decree, the spire vanished so deeply into its mist that only a pale blade of light remained, and the elders set torches at its base. [578]
They came to gather the next confessor, and when they reached our hollow the echoes were already busy, as if the canyon had started the poem without us. [606]
I stepped forward, paint on my hands, throat raw from teaching games, and I addressed the spire as if it had a face. [629]
You counted her until she broke, I said, and so we will count you until you change shape. [647]
Then I began to recite and to misrecite, tossing rhymes that refused to land, and the people caught them, twisted them, and threw them higher. [672]
The echoes braided our voices until even the elders forgot which version had started first, and they looked at one another with the fear that comes when you realize your rules are too small. [706]
The spire shivered in its fog, every torchlight fracturing, as though light itself would refract rather than resolve our chorus into a single decree. [730]
Forgiveness, I called, is not a price you set and we pay; it is the work we do together to hold the shards without cutting ourselves into lies. [758]
Let us confess that there was no single story and ask how to live with that, or do not take another back into your bookkeeping. [783]
The canyon waited, a forged hush holding the breath we all had borrowed. [796]</story>
