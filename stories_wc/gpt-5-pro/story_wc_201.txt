I wake in the ultraviolet forest after the anesthesia wears off, my mouth tasting of iron and antiseptic. [18]
The trees glow with pollen that drinks whatever light is left in the sky and returns it as bruised humming. [38]
I am an enhanced interrogation survivor, and my breath comes with the low double tap of rooms that never let me sleep. [60]
The surgeons told me I would be proprioceptively enhanced, stitched with microfibers that teach my joints new honesty. [78]
They used the word upgrade and forgot the word mercy. [88]
I brace against a knotted trunk and test the calibrations of my knees, feeling the map of myself unfold like echolocation. [109]
The forest has arranged itself into a liturgical maze, a practice they called ultraviolet penance. [124]
You walk until your memories stop flinching, they said, and then you count what is left. [140]
I take the first corridor of reeds and algae and the smell hits me like a thrown cloth, and my wrists try to twist apart. [165]
Remembering through trauma responses is the only archive I trust, because it never stops to polish its entries. [183]
I freeze, then I let the shiver write the date on my bones. [196]
When the spasm loosens, I find the object half buried in moss, a pewter mask strap with a row of tiny teeth. [218]
It must have belonged to one of them, the ones who wore smooth masks to keep our faces from becoming theirs. [239]
Pewter does not rust, it remembers fingerprints. [246]
Along the strap, someone etched numbers, a sequence stepping down, then up, as if measuring a corridor of remorse. [265]
I run my thumb over the soft metal and think of the theorem I came here to prove, the mathematics of mercy. [287]
They promised this place would be both test and tutor, displaced rooted, the way a tree lives where its seed was thrown. [309]
I measure my breathing, not in seconds, but in distances between tendons, because my proprioceptively enhanced nerves report in lengths and angles. [331]
The maze opens into a clearing where the light is almost white, and the penance hum builds like a standing wave. [352]
I stop there and do not pray, because equations are the only prayers I was taught to trust. [370]
Mercy must be a limit, I tell myself, a curve that approaches harm and never touches, but changes the shape of reaching. [392]
If I can solve for it, perhaps the hand that held me under water will lose its claim on my throat. [413]
The pewter mask strap makes a slick crescent in my palm, and I loop it around my wrist the way they looped me to the chair. [439]
I do not tighten it; I mark the distance where comfort ends and compulsion begins, and I count backward. [458]
The numbers on the strap match the steps of the path behind me, but in reverse, a recursion that suggests the solution is a return. [483]
I walk back, heel by toe, testing the proof against the rhythm of my pulse, and the forest obliges with a new corridor. [506]
Each step interrogates the next, but with a softness I am only learning, an audit that asks how not why. [526]
Between the reeds a small camera blinks, or maybe a beetle does, and my ribs clench, my jaw kicks, and the archive opens. [549]
I let the wave pass and I read what it has left, the shape of a night when they asked me to name the names of those I loved. [578]
I gave them the names of stars, I tell the light, and I wait to see if the equation permits that kind of lie. [602]
I came here to discover the mathematics of mercy, not as a scholar but as a failing practitioner. [620]
The maze answers by bending the path toward a pool so still it looks like an equation solved, no remainder, just reflection. [642]
I lean over and the water gives me a face I do not fully trust, a face that survived because it learned to impersonate stone. [667]
The pewter mask strap hangs from my wrist and drips a small circle, and in that circle I sketch a final term. [689]
Mercy equals intention weighted by injury, I say, divided by the power relinquished, and the quotient governs how we enter each other. [711]
It is not proof, but I need a working tool, something to carry out of the ultraviolet forest without turning back into an instrument. [735]
I wrap the strap around a branch at the border of the clearing, a boundary condition that belongs to the place not to me. [759]
Then I walk toward the dark that is less blue, and my feet find their answers like old tools finding their handles. [781]
Behind me the pool keeps still, and ahead the path grows ordinary, which is to say survivable. [798]
