<story>I arrived at the lavender bluff under aurora while forests hold elections, and the sky glanced down like an old recorder. [21]
People call me a luminous skeptic because I glow faintly from nightstudy dust and doubt all stories until they bruise. [41]
Still, something like futuristic nostalgia pulled me north, a hunger to learn why some people carry weather with them. [60]
My grandmother left me a tin compass ring, dull as a bottlecap, that never pointed north but always tasted alive. [80]
It taught me sensing through taste changes, a method the old cartographers kept secret because tongues could be bribed by wind. [101]
Sweet meant warm currents, sour meant pressure falling, bitter meant the storm debt carried by a person with thunder in their pocket. [123]
The ring amplified everything until the world became an emergent compass, arranging direction from countless tiny pulls and flavors. [142]
Above the bluff the aurora flowed like a terrestrially cosmic river, Earth's own spine drinking star milk and whispering votes into the trees. [165]
The forest ballots were pollen and leaf angles, and the counters were lichens with soft antennas listening to wind syllables. [185]
I waited with them because the carriers had promised to converge here when the aurora reached its violet hinge. [204]
They came at dusk like quiet weather stations walking on legs, each trailing a microclimate that clung to their shadows. [224]
A woman with rain soldered along her lashes set a copper kettle on a rock and nodded toward my shining sleeves. [245]
Your glow says skeptic, she said, but your mouth says you know the wind alphabet. [260]
I said I was here to learn why some people carry weather with them, and whether it was choice or sentence. [281]
She introduced herself as Naira of the Drift, and her breath condensed even though the summer around us wore short sleeves. [302]
Weather is memory and duty, she said, and some of us agreed to carry it when the calibrations failed and the forecasts started lying. [326]
The trees vote because they remember water better than we do, and we carry because memory needs legs between oceans. [346]
I tasted the air and found granulated sugar sticking to my tongue, the signature of a person storing sunlight in their bones. [368]
Naira pointed to a child whose pockets leaked fog, and the ring brightened my saliva with wintergreen. [385]
When the forest tallies sway, she said, the burdens lift to those who swore to ferry them, until counts are final. [406]
Some inherit from parents, some volunteer, some are chosen by the emergent compass that forms when you listen hard to the planet. [428]
Her kettle steamed, and the steam fell as a small private rain that kept time against the aurora like a drummer. [449]
We watched the sky ripple while forests hold elections, listening to branches argue in creaks and sap syllables. [467]
I felt another shift, a citrus spark that meant the counts were closing, and tasted tin, which meant my ring wanted speaking. [489]
I pressed it to my tongue, and a map arrived as flavor, not of places but of promises aching to reunite. [510]
We should converge on the spine of the bluff, I said, because the taste turns saline there, and salt binds storms. [531]
Naira lifted the kettle and others followed with their clouded coats, the child trailing fog like a cloak being shortened. [551]
At the crest the aurora throbbed, a banner, and my ring poured mint, iron, and honey across my mouth until I trembled. [573]
The flavors locked into place like gears, a terrestrially cosmic machine clicking its teeth, requesting the carriers to spill their skies. [594]
Naira opened her hands and released rain that remembered deserts, the child breathed out the fog of orphaned glaciers, and others followed. [616]
The aurora swallowed their weather like a patient teacher, then wrote it back brighter, and the trees eased, and the counting settled. [638]
When it finished, the air tasted of clean stone and warm milk, which meant debt cleared and duties set down. [658]
Naira smiled without steam and said that carrying weather was never punishment, only a bridge for memory when the planet forgot names. [680]
I believed her, though a luminous skeptic cannot stop testing, so I tasted the night and found an afterglow of direction. [701]
It was the emergent compass again, a map writ by mouths and bluffs and ballots, pointing not north but toward the next promise. [724]
I put the tin compass ring back on, thanked the trees for their counted breath, and walked home tasting the future. [745]
What I wanted to know had been there all along, in the language of sensing through taste changes, patiently waiting for us to listen. [769]</story>
