<story>In the Amber grotto at dusk, I tuned my trade with affectionate detachment and steady hands. [16]
People come to me for feelings they cannot grow, and I deal in them like cut gems. [33]
I am a counterfeit emotion dealer, professionally thorough, because sloppy fabrications bruise the heart twice. [48]
My motivation is simple and treacherous, to fuse insight with empathy without drowning in either. [63]
The wall of resinous stone hummed with a low charge, and I listened the way fish hear riverbeds. [81]
Sensing through static electricity is my crooked stethoscope. [89]
A palm on amber, a knee against linen, and the prickling tells me where the currents of yearning snag. [108]
Half truths are the only alloys that hold, and I carry a jeweler's loupe for invisible lies. [125]
When Liora stepped in, the grotto warmed as if a hearth had breathed, and her gaze cataloged me back. [144]
She was a fragrance chemist, her coat freckled with resin dust, carrying a Fragrance chemist's blotter petal like a pressed oath. [165]
On it a dry whisper of labdanum and tears had stained a faint petal vein the color of dusk. [184]
I said hello with the kind of warmth that does not cling, an affectionate detachment I have learned to trust. [204]
She said she needed courage enough to finish the base accord of a memorial perfume without embalming herself in grief. [224]
I told her courage is the child of fear and knowledge, and I sell adoption papers, never offspring. [242]
She offered the blotter petal, and my fingertips sparked when I took it, the static netting us like spidersilk. [261]
From the charge I felt her lab bench at midnight, a metronome of drips, and the ache of a last voicemail. [282]
I laid the petal on my slate and drew the electrodes close, as a doctor readies balm and blade. [301]
Professionally thorough, I calibrated amperage, scent memory, and the rhythm of her breath until the grotto's hum matched her pulse. [321]
Half truths, I reminded us both, are the bones of bridges, not destinations. [334]
Give me the outline, and I will coax your heart to color inside it without claiming the canvas. [352]
She nodded, though fear hung from her lashes, and she whispered that real grief threatened to subsume her work. [371]
Subsume nothing, I said; let us channel, not drown. [380]
I wired the petal as a wick, absorbing her remembered notes, and opened the cabinet of precompounded moods. [398]
On the top shelf waited an accord I had brewed from orris, standing water, and the careful lie of surviving. [418]
I let it breathe toward her across the cool glow, while my other hand searched her static for dissonance and sincerity. [439]
Every twitch sparked a syllable, and the grotto translated, limestone consonants fusing with amber vowels until meaning struck. [457]
She confessed a thing she had never said aloud, that she had perfected molecules to avoid imperfect mourning. [475]
I threaded her confession into the accord, neither absolving nor accusing, letting the counterfeit courage lift her just enough to see. [496]
She smelled the poem I had built and her nose trembled, but her eyes stayed open, observant rather than undone. [516]
The room gathered close, and I felt the exact instant when belief kissed doubt and decided to go steady. [535]
As the transformation completes, the counterfeit always finds its limit, and either fractures or ripens into something that outlives me. [555]
This one ripened, and she reached for the slate not to clutch it, but to steady herself against a world returned to depth. [578]
Her tears smelled of salt and vetiver, and she thanked the bridge without mistaking it for the shore. [596]
She asked what I feel when I stitch strangers together with glues like this, and I was honest enough to live. [617]
I told her I feel a caring that stands a step back from the fire, a shelter of affectionate detachment. [637]
What I make for others rarely keeps for me, and the static leaves me briefly clean, then uncarved again. [656]
After she left, I lifted the blotter petal and slipped it into my ledger, a pressed witness in a phloxless book. [677]
The grotto dimmed like a patient closing their eyes, and the day's charges dissipated without complaint. [693]
I stood in the amber dusk, humming with leftover possibilities, already listening for the next trembling current to arrive. [712]</story>
