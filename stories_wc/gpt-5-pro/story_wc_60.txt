<story>They called me the luminous skeptic because I refused to worship anything I could not test. [16]
Still, I carried a lantern dusted with mica, and it made me glow in alleys. [31]
In the city of forgotten fountains, light matters more than water, because water no longer moves. [47]
We had been waiting from the pause of migrating geese, when the air itself seemed to hold its breath. [66]
That was when the fountains first fell silent, and the people began forgetting which doors were theirs. [83]
I wanted to liberate trapped memories, not out of nostalgia, but because without them the city could not wake. [102]
Shadows collected in the bowls of the fountains like cooled tar, anchoring every thought that tried to rise. [120]
When I say I am realistically imaginative, I mean I trust the rules but also bend them slowly. [138]
Sidereal patience is the key to bending without breaking, the kind of patience stars keep toward night. [155]
I learned it after the first winter ended and nothing thawed except my doubts. [169]
The old cartographer told me that the memories were trapped inside a stained glass box hidden under a fountain. [188]
But the cartographer had forgotten which fountain, and the map bled into itself like wet ink. [204]
All he remembered were crumbs of color, a path left by someone who knew they would forget. [221]
So I went by following breadcrumbs, not the bread of wheat but the bread of glass. [237]
Tiny triangles winked from gutters and stairs, blue, then green, then a shard the color of sunset blood. [255]
They led me through arcades where fountains lay crusted with coins and birds had built nests in dry spouts. [274]
At each bowl I whispered in a defiant hush, daring the water to remember itself. [289]
No prayer answered, but the whispers kept the city from thinking it had already died. [304]
The last trail of shards ended at the oldest square, where the first fountain was said to speak once a century. [325]
There, a statue of a heron waited with its beak to the sky, as if listening for geese. [343]
Under the base I found a panel gummy with pitch, edges stuck where the city had tried to forget harder. [363]
I pried with the thin brass blade I carry, made for letters but good for false hearts too. [381]
The panel would not unstick until I told the statue a secret I had never told myself. [398]
I said my father taught me to test everything because he feared being fooled, and I feared becoming him. [417]
The pitch gave with a sigh like a bubble, and the panel swung inward on protesting hinges. [434]
Inside lay the stained glass box, fused on its corners with lead that showed the finger marks of its maker. [454]
Tiny panes shaped into constellations made its faces, and something drifted within like breath behind ice. [470]
When I lifted it, the city inhaled, but no water ran, and far above, the geese held their V as if pinned. [492]
I set the box on the rim of the dry basin and watched the constellations shift into a key. [511]
Here is where skepticism saves me from superstition and delivers me to work. [524]
I waited with sidereal patience until the Heron star on the lid matched the pocket of shadow cast by the statue. [545]
Then I pressed both my thumbs where the maker had pressed, and the lead seams warmed like buried coals. [564]
The lid sighed open, and a wind smelling of pepper and lilacs sped through the square. [580]
Shapes flew out, not birds, not paper, but laughters, laments, and street names, each carrying its own weight. [598]
A woman a block away called for water without remembering why, and the dry pipes answered with a cough. [617]
Memories flew toward their owners as if pulled by magnets, kissing foreheads, sinking into chests, shaking dust from tongues. [636]
Some hovered, orphaned, then tucked themselves into the cracks of buildings to wait for new claimants. [652]
I felt a small one press against my own throat, the taste of river water and a word half-mouthed. [671]
It was my father calling my name the day he showed me a pump, explaining the valves like bones. [690]
I let it pass through me and out again, understanding he had been afraid because he loved too hard. [709]
The fountains hiccuped, then ran, not all at once, but in cautious threads that braided more strongly with every breath. [729]
The geese lowered from their held pose, circled, and resumed their route, as if time had unstuck itself. [747]
Around me the square filled with murmurs, not loud, not yet, but a defiant hush that promised a chorus. [766]
I wrapped the emptied box and set it back under the base, so the city would remember where to look next time. [788]</story>
