Fog folded itself into statues that breathed like sleeping animals in the garden. [13]
It was a fog sculpture garden, tidal at its edges, patient as an ear. [27]
The junkyard prophet came barefoot, pockets rattling with screws and tape reels, listening. [40]
He was precognitively forgetful, which meant the future fell out of his hands early. [54]
He wrote himself instructions because memory was always already gone, like footprints before tide. [68]
Tonight he had one motive, to capture the sound of growing older. [80]
He believed age spoke, not in words, but in the pressure after words. [93]
He carried a piece of plain chalk and an obsolete recorder heavy as guilt. [107]
The chalk would stand in for his future, scratching prompts where fog might erase him. [122]
With the recorder he hoped to bottle what time sounds like when it thickens. [136]
But the garden altered directions, and he had to give himself signs. [148]
He started arranging driftwood as directional markers up the gravel paths and around statues. [162]
Each bleached stick pointed like a finger from a future self to a forgetting present. [177]
Between the marble figures, a blade runner, a saint, a bell without a tongue, fog hummed. [193]
The prophet paused and laid the recorder on a plinth, red light unblinking as a buoy. [209]
He could almost hear his mother turning pages somewhere long before his birth. [222]
He could hear tomorrow forgetting him, a soft hiss like an unspooled cassette. [235]
He whispered: I am clinging to echoes, do not let them peel away. [248]
The garden did not answer, but the statues seemed to lean closer, as listeners do. [263]
He chalked on the base of a drowned queen: Remember to walk backward when lost. [278]
He chalked on the step of a headless wolf: Sing before you speak, then stop. [293]
He chalked on the recorder: Do not rewind yet, let the hush become a room. [308]
The tide breathed in, and somewhere gravel ticked underfoot like the teeth of sleep. [322]
He had come here amid the hush of old videotapes left unwatched in his trailer. [337]
Their boxes whispered of weddings never rewatched, parties receding, plastic sleeves warm with dust. [351]
He thought perhaps the sound of growing older lay between those unplayed frames. [364]
But the garden suggested otherwise, that age was an ocean rehearsing its collapse endlessly. [378]
He needed to locate the oldest breath here, the inhale before statues learned stillness. [392]
So he planted more driftwood arrows, their grain glittering wet, pointing toward a fogged amphitheater. [407]
He took the recorder and walked, stopping whenever a memory leapt away in advance. [421]
His hands remembered before his mind, and they lifted the chalk, leaving brighter bones on stone. [437]
On the amphitheater stage he found a sculpture of two chairs facing opposite directions. [451]
Between them, a space like an ear, big enough to sit inside and listen. [465]
He slid into that hollow, pressed record, and tasted salt, maybe from old tears. [479]
In the monitors he heard footsteps layered, small feet, larger feet, canes counting days. [493]
He heard laughter thinning until it became breath, then breath thinning until it became surf. [508]
He heard his own voice from after now, saying, You will lose this unless you anchor it. [525]
So he pressed the chalk to the amphitheater floor and drew a circle called Keep. [540]
He set the recorder in that circle and let it drink the fog like broth. [555]
Outside, his driftwood markers ticked as raindrops found them, a clock repaired by weather. [569]
He felt the futures coming loose, memories falling before they had somewhere to land. [583]
He did what he always did, arranging driftwood as directional markers around the listening pit. [598]
If he returned without a mind, the arrows would walk him home by habit. [612]
He closed his eyes and let the recorder roll through the garden like a tide. [627]
On tape, the fog told him secrets in the grammar of sustained departures. [640]
It said that growing older is the sound of leaving without stopping anywhere at all. [655]
It said the statues performed patience, but the sea wrote their names and unnames nightly. [670]
He lifted the recorder from the circle called Keep and felt it thrum warm. [684]
He did not rewind, because he had chalked the command, and he obeyed his future. [699]
As he stepped away, a wave shouldered through the paths and shifted several arrows. [713]
He felt the loss occur early, knowledge evaporating before the forgetting even arrived. [726]
He kissed the recorder as if it were an ear returning from exile. [739]
He followed what arrows remained and what chalk words he could still believe. [752]
On the way out he passed the drowned queen, who now seemed to exhale. [766]
He exhaled with her, recording both breaths, and the tape bloomed with gray light. [780]
In that bloom he heard a harbor, the home he could not remember yet. [794]
