By the time I reached the herbalist's underground garden, winter had stitched silence into every footstep. [16]
I was a cryptid researcher working undercover, pretending to catalog roots while listening for legends that breathed. [33]
The city above suffered from returning people who were not themselves, and after the missing return changed everything, we went below. [54]
Dani the herbalist called the place a hospital for seeds and grief. [66]
Roots dangled from brick ribs and tiny spores swam through the air in rings that felt gravitationally playful. [84]
It was a bubble of breath under ice, and inside it I kept my frostbitten hope alive. [101]
I told Dani I was cataloging lichens, but really I was tracing a rumor called a harmony untamed. [119]
Old miners claimed the song unstitched gravity for a heartbeat, and cryptids slipped through the loosened weave. [136]
To find it, I carried my grandmother's flint arrowhead, the only inheritance that knew when the earth itself was a drum. [157]
When worries kept me from sleeping, I rubbed the arrowhead against the rim of a clay jar until it sang. [177]
The first night, the singing woke an old cordless phone tucked behind sacks of valerian and bitter orange. [195]
Dani frowned at it like at a snake, then excused herself, and I cradled the receiver. [211]
A voice came through via the static-laden confessions on an old cordless phone, and it sounded like weather apologizing. [230]
You are late, it said, but your lateness has tuned you to a better ache. [245]
I asked what waited, and the voice answered, a harmony untamed waits for your arrow to become a mouth. [264]
I nearly laughed, because all my training said do not anthropomorphize rocks. [276]
Then I remembered why I was here, to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke, to make mockery of the bruise that would not fade. [300]
The bruise had a name, Marko, my partner who returned from a pit three towns away speaking like a broken radio. [321]
He could not meet my eyes, and his hand, once steady, cycled through unknown signs like fish under ice. [340]
His missing return had changed him and our work, so I changed my name and followed a seam in the city. [361]
Dani took me in because I knew how to speak to plants with the patience of snowfall. [378]
To the phone I whispered, if you are the cryptid I seek, show me what language you need. [396]
Bring stone to leaf, it replied, and let the wound sing. [407]
I scraped the flint arrowhead along a willow branch until sparks of scent leapt up like memories of rain. [426]
Something in the soil stirred, not an animal exactly, more a pressure that tilted my bones. [442]
Pollen began to orbit Dani's jars, a choreography small and gravitationally playful, and from the phone came a hum. [461]
The hum became words, and the words carved a doorway I had only read about in journals that no one could keep for long. [485]
Metamorphose, the voice said, not your body, but the joke you clutch around your hurt. [500]
I thought of holding Marko's teeth the night he returned and laughed about weather to keep from breaking. [518]
Maybe my laughter kept him, or maybe it pushed him further into whatever choir had borrowed his mouth. [536]
I pressed the arrowhead to my tongue, tasted old fire and river stain, and let the stupidest pun lick free. [556]
I told the air that rocks do not hold grudges because they lack sedimentality, and it was so bad I nearly forgave myself. [579]
The garden shivered as if relieved, jars clinked, and Dani returned, face pale, eyes bright like frostflakes. [596]
She said, they are ready to be seen, and I nodded and did not ask who they were. [614]
From the far bed a figure unspooled from fern shadow, antlers woven from icicle light, hooves soft as mist. [633]
It carried no weight until it chose to, and its step made fruit roll toward it laughing. [650]
I knew it then as the cryptid I had been tracing, the singer of a harmony untamed. [667]
It spoke without moving its jaw, the phone translating with a patience only grief learns. [682]
You cover yourself in research, it said, but the thing you want is a good punch line. [699]
I told it my true name and my false one, and why I had hidden under soil, and what I owed. [720]
If you can turn your bitterness into a cosmic joke, it said, then the city can remember without breaking again. [740]
Teach them to laugh where it hurts, and keep the arrowhead dry, because it is a tongue now. [758]
Dani placed her palm on the soil and promised to feed the choir with compost and quiet. [775]
I felt my cover metamorphose into a vow, and the phone clicked as if satisfied to hang up the storm. [795]
