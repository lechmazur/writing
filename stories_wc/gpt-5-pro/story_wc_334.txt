<story>I return to the sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks with a diver's caution and a pilgrim's ache. [18]
Decades later, the silt still remembers my name, and the glass remembers my breath. [32]
I am a hands-on folklorist, chronically curious, trained in tidewriting and the empirics of rumor. [47]
I did not come to pry coins from hulls or save apples embalmed in brine. [62]
I came to recover stolen memories, the ones the flood bargained away and the wrecks have kept. [79]
Memory thieves are rarely men with sacks; they are habits, ruts, tides, and the bargains you sign without reading. [98]
Here the bargains are written in kelp and rust, and I can still read the script. [114]
I surface and submerge with the same careful breathing I learned as a child hiding from storms. [131]
Back then I strung orchard myths into necklaces, not knowing which bead would cut the skin. [147]
Now I catalog the current's small noises with notebooks zipped in oilskin, pretending not to hope. [163]
Rusty prows lean like book spines around the greenhouse shell, their figureheads blind to my return. [179]
When I was young, I promised the apple trees a song for every secret they kept. [195]
They paid me in blossoms, bees, and a shadow that never matched my feet. [209]
The shadow is why I am here, decades later, asking it to carry me backward. [224]
I drift down the corridor of ribs and panes, past apples that have learned to sway like anemones. [242]
On a bed of silt, under an antique ladder, a fairy ring mushroom has drawn a perfect circle. [260]
Its cap is the color of old maps, with a paler rim like a kept promise. [276]
Folklore says a ring marks a doorway, and I accept doorways as colleagues rather than myths. [292]
I am careful, but I touch, because I am a hands-on folklorist and because doors like manners. [309]
The ring trembles and releases a pollen of faint light, which lifts like dust in sunbeams. [325]
Each mote carries a fragment, the taste of a spice, the shape of a syllable, the weight of a hand. [345]
I have read about tricks like this; I prefer to test them my own way. [360]
I detect the stolen drift of my life by studying broken constellations on the glazed roof and rusty hulls. [379]
There are gaps where stars should be; the missing panes rhyme with portholes that have no ships left. [397]
If I map those absences, I can name the currents that once braided my choices. [412]
Names matter more underwater, where vowels travel slow and consonants snap like fish. [425]
The fish here know my mother, my first teacher in superstition, who shelled hope like peas. [441]
She taught me the moment to strike bargains is when habits break, because then the pattern listens. [458]
I check my watch, though the tide keeps truer time, and count the breaths between creaks. [474]
In the quiet interval, crisp nostalgia cuts the water like peppermint, and I let it sting me awake. [492]
There was a summer of mirrored jars and ribbon, a wedding nobody remembered a year later. [508]
The vows were written on greenhouse glass, and the storm took them as payment. [522]
I dive to the bench where we kept the cider press, and the ring of the mushroom brightens. [540]
Inside the circle, the water tastes like apples, bitter first, then the sweetness we forgot. [555]
I step through with careful fin strokes, not breaking the silt geometry, and hum the song I owe. [573]
The shipwrecks creak in assent, old choir lofts with barnacle tenors, and the light resolves. [588]
Fragments spool from the ring like film, and I watch a girl with my shadow at noon. [605]
She is not me yet, but she has my doubt, and she bargains with a glass pane for time. [624]
The pane wants a name, and she gives it the wrong one, so the debt hooks to us both. [643]
I slide my gloved hand over the film and breathe out, blurring the scene until it loosens. [660]
I learned this trick from eels that sleep in bottles, who fog the glass to forget the mouth. [678]
The wrong name unwinds and sinks, and the right one swims up, tasting like iron and mint. [695]
I speak it, and the ring's light thickens until it is a coat I can wear. [711]
Inside its lining, I find the taste of cider, the smell of woodsmoke, the rhythm of my mother's hands. [730]
They lace themselves back along my spine like buttons, and I stand straighter in the water. [746]
The greenhouse creaks again, not with warning, but with relief, a structure freed from an old mispronunciation. [763]
I turn to the fairy ring mushroom and bow, because I understand debts and I came here to pay. [782]
The spores settle like first snow, and I know which promises to keep this time. [797]</story>
