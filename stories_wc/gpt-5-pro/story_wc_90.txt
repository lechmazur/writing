<story>The recycled spaceship drifted among glinting scraps of failed utopias, its hull a patchwork of museum glass and farm equipment, and I kept vigil with ghostly resolve. [27]
It is after the last human is born, and the nursery wing is quiet except for the breaths of one sleeping child. [49]
I am a steadfast pacifist by oath and fracture, the kind who learned to hold broken things without closing a fist. [70]
When happiness manages to visit, my body goes gravitationally lighter when happy, and the ship braids artificial gravity to keep me from drifting into fans. [95]
Around my neck hangs kwan yin's tear, a droplet of patient glass cut from the observation dome of a drowned temple. [116]
We built the vessel from broken stations and funerary scaffolds, then seeded it with archives, soil, and a midwife who delivered the only sleeper before dying. [142]
I keep course toward a sealed cul-de-sac of physics, for my one remaining motivation is to push open a locked dimension without wounding anything. [166]
I learned where to try via the faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs, each silvered vein revealing a coordinate when seen through the droplet. [192]
Held to the gallery wall, kwan yin's tear bent starlight into phosphorescent threads, and the residue of grief became a star map that no engine could counterfeit. [219]
To follow it I had to attempt shadow work, unspooling the terrified knots I hid from myself, because the door would not tolerate a liar's weight. [245]
I argued with the ship's old warhead software that wanted to pry the lock with impact, and I declined, as steadfast pacifists do: by staying. [270]
Instead I would stitch our torn trajectory with patience, weaving our speed through debris fields like thread through worn cloth. [290]
When I remembered my father singing to the unborn, my joy loosened me, and I grew lighter, rose, and reached a maintenance shaft no ladder could reach. [317]
I left a recorder by the cot so the child would have a voice if I never returned, a lullaby made from engine harmonics. [341]
The lock hung in an interstice behind the waste reclamation ring, where repurposed pipes crossed like sutures, murmuring like a throat learning the first vowel. [366]
I threaded a filament through the hatchwork and pressed the droplet against microetchings, feeling reality yield like skin as if begging to be stitched closed again. [392]
I needed joy to ease my weight on the threshold, so I lifted the tear above the portraits and teased back the map with a remembered laugh. [419]
But shadow work does not spare, and I saw how gently spoken neglect had bruised me into silence, and how I had bruised others by echo. [445]
I pricked my thumb on a bent suture needle and let one drop fall, then began to stitch a seam of light between two humming plates. [471]
The door puckered like scar tissue, resisting every tenderness, and I understood why the warhead had argued, but I pushed open with breath and mercy. [496]
Happiness, strange and disciplined, rose as the memory of the midwife's smile returned, and I lightened until my boots barely kissed metal, keeping the seam from bruising. [523]
Behind the plates bloomed a room not of space but of roomness itself, a locked dimension flexing like a lung that had forgotten air. [547]
I slung the strap of the cot across my shoulders, its small occupant dreaming in an oxygen hood, and we stepped inside as if crossing a threshold of forgiveness. [576]
Inside, the place spoke through pressure gradients, asking for a vow, and I answered, stitching my name to the catalog of caretakers woven through its hush. [602]
Only the parts of me I had refused answered back, confessing in whispers, until the chamber and I made a bargain to hold what we could not heal. [630]
I left the door laced with threads of forgiven memory, a suture shining between plates, and the ship's old programs stood down like tired veterans. [655]
The recycled spaceship no longer felt cobbled but quilted, and every patch sang, because we had stitched ourselves to a home that wanted only gentleness. [680]
I laid the child on the floor of that breathing room and told stories, and we hovered a little, gravitationally lighter, happy to be spared collapsing into despair. [708]
In the distance, the faded photographs on the gallery wall lost their salt, as if the long-dried tears had been spent to buy us a key. [734]
I slept at last, not victorious but kept, holding kwan yin's tear against my chest while the door breathed, promising to stay open so long as we kept doing the work. [765]</story>
