<story>The last lights died across the domed avenues when the pumps failed, leaving me in shadowed hush during the blackout. [20]
I stood inside the forgotten library inside a sunken city, hearing brine tick against cracked mosaics like a slow metronome. [40]
I was the logical page indexer assigned to the drowned stacks, summoned not to salvage but to understand. [58]
My charter was simple and exacting, to trace honest origins in records warped by tide, rumor, and grief. [76]
I carried an antique ink stamp in a waterproof satchel, a small brass witness with a wooden handle polished by departed hands. [98]
Without the grid glow, the aisles opened like trenches, and my headlamp cut a thread of milk over spines furred with salt. [120]
The blackout was a hazard to timers and seals, yet it offered a listening grace I had long needed. [139]
In that reclaimed stillness, my pulse slowed to the old cadence of study, and I could hear the books resist and breathe. [161]
I was a tranquilly perceptive worker when quiet returned, and the city above might as well have been myth. [180]
People said the library had drowned because no one needed it, but that was a lazy legend I refused to index. [201]
It was drowned because a city broke, and because the truth stored here threatened the men who built the new shoreline. [222]
The stamp had once sealed civic receipts, and its impression, a tiny kelp frond circling an eye, recurred across many ledgers. [243]
Salvors claimed that any page bearing it must be authentic, yet my assignment demanded an alternative hypothesis. [260]
Perhaps the antique ink stamp had been copied by forgers who wished to legalize the theft of soft boundaries and hard lives. [282]
To test motive and method, I had to readjust my habits from catalog to fieldwork, from counting pages to weighing their sound. [304]
I closed my lamp and let blue algae veins seep their muffled luminance through ceiling fractures, a dappled resolve flowing over stone. [326]
With palms steady, I inked the stamp on a pad of soot and balm, then pressed it onto blank rag, counting grains embedded by age. [351]
The genuine die left a serrated crescent at the edge of the frond, where salt-scoring had gnawed the brass decades before the flood. [374]
On suspect pages, the crescent lacked teeth, a smooth convenience that spoke of a workshop too clean and a conscience too polished. [396]
I readjusted the indexed order of bound ports to follow the kelp imagery across time, not alphabet, and a pattern rose like breath. [419]
Before the break, the frond curled inward; after, the frond stared outward, as if the eye had been taught to watch the incoming ships. [443]
Such staring belonged to the new rulers, and the smooth crescent accompanied their proclamations, parading a borrowed authenticity with every seal. [464]
I traced a ledger to a name I knew from family quarrels, the harbor judge who altered allotments the year our house went under. [488]
My father called him efficient, my mother called him a tide, and I called him wrong without having the proof to earn it. [511]
Now, under algae stars, I had proof in the gnawed crescent, the ink tooth no counterfeit bothered to imitate. [530]
But I would not let rage propel the index, because revenge writes crooked, and crooked writing is another way water wins. [551]
So I drew up an alternative hypothesis tree, branches mapped by dates, pigments, and the angles of the frond eye. [571]
At each branch, I tested for salt crescents and for the weight of strokes, then scored them against confessions embedded in the margins. [594]
The blackout kept its hold, and I kept mine, breathing with the tide flex of the dome as silt settled like thinking. [616]
A little drone battered the shutter and failed, and I listened until its propellers gave up the cause of watching me work. [638]
When the dome steadied, I stamped four final notes, one per ledger, marking where the honest eye ended and the smooth crescent began. [661]
Each note was a promise to carry upstairs when lights returned, but also a promise to the silent builders who carved these tables. [684]
They had made a room for thinking in a city that would later forget thinking, and I would reclaim it for truth. [706]
I checked the seals, tied my satchel, and paused to readjust the chalk arrow I had left for any other careful wanderer. [728]
The arrow pointed not toward the exit but toward a desk where the eye frond first changed, because beginnings are where faith returns. [751]
I left the headlamp off as I went, letting reclaimed stillness accompany me like a colleague who asks only what is necessary. [773]
When the grid woke some hours later, it would find the library already awake, pages queued by a logical page indexer and an honest stamp. [798]</story>
