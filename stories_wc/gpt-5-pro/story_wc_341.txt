<story>After the string breaks, the sky gondola keeps floating like a thought refusing to end. [15]
I steady the brass telescope against my cheek and judge the hush by its grain. [30]
That hush is quietly explosive, a pressure bloom so gentle it can lift us for hours. [46]
I am an aviation meteorologist, but tonight my data are grief and dust. [59]
You left during the launch, laughing at the frayed rope, promising to retie it after the first drift. [77]
Then the tether kissed an edge of wind and unstitched itself, and you leaned too far for a camera angle. [97]
The gondola rose without you, and the empty space around your absence kept the shape of your shoulders. [115]
I have to prove that empty spaces remember, or else the atmosphere is a liar. [130]
So I work the altimeter and the burner and the notebooks, keeping vigil under dusty starlight. [146]
I memorialize you not with statues but with method, because method is what holds me together. [162]
It begins with categorizing clouds by emotion, a discipline you once mocked as meteorology for poets. [178]
I watch the cirrus and call them wistful; I call the stratus loyal and the cumulus stubborn. [195]
When towers rise, their cores are angrily patient, and the anvils are eloquent in their fatigue. [211]
Each classification is a thread of belief, a spool I turn by hand until the whine quiets. [228]
I am building what you once called spooled wholeness, a way to wind fragments into something that can float. [247]
You were the one who carried string in your pocket, tying the world where it gaped or threatened to fray. [267]
After the string breaks, I test my theorem on absence like a match held to breath. [283]
I point the brass telescope through the gap you left and listen for the echo of nothing. [300]
The lens fogs with the heat of my face, then clears to a scatter of cold stars. [317]
Their light is dusty, old as crossed deserts, but it drifts down into my little capsule anyway. [334]
In that sifted light, I see the wake your body left in the air as a pale cylinder. [352]
It is a negative monument, and I memorialize it by tracing its edges with a carpenter pencil. [369]
The graphite line trembles with the gondola as if the absence were breathing back. [383]
I annotate the drawing: melancholic cumulonimbus, quietly explosive, parenting hail it never intends to drop. [398]
Below us, the town lights smudge and pull like lanternfish, but above, the atmosphere is a patient archive. [416]
Every gust writes, every lull remembers, and I am here to decipher what the air keeps. [432]
Your fall is not a vanishing, I tell the night, it is an indentation with direction. [448]
I calculate its half-life by the persistence of eddies and by the slow consent of stars to be measured. [467]
My charts have a column for tenderness, a column for regret, and an asterisk for courage. [483]
When the burner coughs, the balloon rises into colder layers where memory is less diluted. [498]
The gondola creaks like a pendulum, and my breath fogs the notebook again with small planets. [514]
Your name in the margins pulls taut like a string that still believes in knots. [529]
I whisper the categories again and again until they become a liturgy for air. [543]
Stratus, loyal; altocumulus, wistful; cirrostratus, forgiving; cumulonimbus, grieving; the special cloud that only absence composes, remembering. [559]
The telescope shows it as a dim braille against the Milky Way, a pattern of touches without hands. [577]
I reach through the cylinder and feel a cooler gradient, a proof by fingers that grief has texture. [595]
I tie a fresh line to the rail and knot it to the absence, careful not to disturb its memory. [615]
The line pays out, then holds, and the whole balloon steadies as if grateful for a new center. [633]
It is not rescue; I know you are already geography, but the shape learns it is seen. [650]
The barometer jitters, then settles, and the stars seem to come a hand closer. [664]
Thus the experiment proceeds: not to trap you, but to show the world that its holes are faithful. [682]
The next night I will lower a ribbon into your wake, and wind it back the way a prayer returns. [702]
If it comes up scented with ozone and a hint of your soap, that will be enough. [719]
If it does not, I will keep categorizing until the air concedes a truth larger than fault. [736]
Either way, we will have proved that the sky is a loom and absence is yarn. [752]
And when dawn finds me, papered in pencil dust and star grit, I will be almost whole. [769]
Not because the missing is mended, but because the spool has remembered how to wind. [784]</story>
