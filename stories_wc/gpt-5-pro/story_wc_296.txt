<story>After the magic trick fails, the lake stops pretending to be a mirror. [13] Its skin goes black, and the wind knits a hush like armor across the water. [28] Only then does the guarded druid step from the reeds, carrying a pouch that murmurs. [43] She is called Issa of the Returning, because she finds lost things and returns them. [58] Today she seeks not a ring or a child, but a truth that refuses reflection. [73] She has come to the swirling orchard vortex at the heart of a cursed lake. [88] Here, drowned trees circle like dancers shackled together, apples orbiting them in a solemn storm. [103] At the center lies a disk of trapped ice with words blurred inside it, a frozen confession. [120] Issa does not smile, but the calm around her feels honed, an old warlike serenity. [135] She has not forgiven the man whose secret sleeps here, nor herself for keeping it. [150] He taught her to disguise guilt with tricks, to keep deception balanced on glittering surfaces. [165] But after the last audience gasped and the magic trick failed, she remembered the lake. [180] Mirrors hide what matters, he used to say, and she crossed the hills to disprove him. [196] Her purpose is to discover what mirrors don't show, and the orchard answers with silence. [211] Issa empties the pouch and the flesh-eating plant seed clinks onto a flat stone. [225] It is small, the color of bruised milk, and it thirsts for skin and secrecy alike. [241] She has carried it since she found it in a grave grown over with black trumpet. [257] Plants devour truth as easily as flesh, and this one eats its way into veils. [272] She needs it to gnaw the ice without shattering the words trapped inside. [285] To begin, she kneels on the shore and breathes through expanding circles of thought. [299] Her mind rings outward, calm and tactical, meeting wave, branch, current, and silence in turn. [314] Through expanding circles she senses the orchard's rotation, the subtle shiver of roots in exile. [329] She lifts her head and whispers, unbend, to the knotting current and to herself. [343] The water obeys in increments, loosening its fists without losing its discipline. [355] Issa sets the flesh-eating plant seed upon the ice and pricks her palm above it. [370] Blood pearls fall, and the seed unfurls a mouth of tiny sieves that drink her offering. [386] It scours the surface without cracking it, eating only the film of spells smeared there. [401] Beneath, letters coalesce, skeletal as winter fish, and then they hold still, readable and cold. [416] The frozen confession belongs to her teacher, Master Ren, and its language gnaws like acid. [431] He writes of a night when the orchard drowned, not by storm, but by his command. [447] He feared the lake would show his face, so he forced it to spin and forget. [463] He used her hands for the ritual, binding apple boughs into rings that keep circling still. [479] She tastes bile and iron, and then she steadies herself as if setting spear to shield. [495] There is no room for spectacle now, only for the clarity that follows a battle prayer. [511] Issa cups the ice and speaks to the orchard as one speaks to warriors who are tired. [528] Unbend, she says again, but not to the water now, to the pattern that holds it obedient. [545] She loosens the rings that her younger self wove, one by one, through expanding circles of release. [562] The orchard's spin softens; branches breathe; apples bump the shore like helmets stacked after drill. [577] The ice thins and the words deepen, no longer screaming, simply standing as they were written. [593] She reads them aloud so the lake hears, so the lake learns the shape of truth again. [610] Master Ren drowned the orchard to erase the face of the murdered king from the sky. [626] He left the confession here and taught her mirrors, never expecting the finder to return. [641] She grinds the reading into the water until even the roots nod, agreeing in their silence. [657] Then she lifts the seed and turns it in her bloody palm, slow as a moon gaining. [674] You fed on me, she tells it, now feed on what kept me from myself. [689] She places the seed where the rings were knotted, and it eats the last binding. [704] The remaining swirl stalls, then divides into paths that lead back to shore and orchard. [719] The lake, relieved of its forced disguise, reflects nothing but winter sky and a steady woman. [735] In that blankness she sees precisely what mirrors don't show, the room inside her armor. [750] It is not empty, but ready, and it makes her ache in a clean way. [765] She gathers the confession, wraps the seed, and walks outward by the paths she loosened. [780] Behind her, the orchard leans toward dawn as if handed a final order to stand down. [796]</story>
