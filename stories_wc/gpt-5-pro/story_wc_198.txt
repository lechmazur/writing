<story>I came before dawn, a morning fog saxophonist with breath borrowed from sleeping reeds. [14]
The path led down into a radiant grotto in mist, a throat of stone and light. [30]
Here, as dewdrops form, the air creates voices you could mistake for your own remembered regret. [46]
They speak in code, a lattice of drips and echoes the elders warned me never to repeat. [63]
But the code keeps speaking itself, and I came to hush a prophecy spoken in code. [79]
The grotto holds a prism atrium in mist, a glass rib cage cupping the pale sky. [95]
Dawn rolls in like breath through a horn, quietly vivid yet careful not to break anything. [111]
I set the case beside ferns silvered by drip, their filigree trembling with bright caution. [126]
Eerie nostalgia lingers here, the memory of my first lesson cut into the rock by silence. [142]
My teacher showed me how to play through negative space, where shape comes from what you refuse. [159]
He called it the vested hush, a garment of no sound that still shoulders weight. [174]
Wear it, he said, when the cave begins to speak for you. [186]
Now the cave does speak, and the code licks my ears like a patient tide. [201]
It promises a town forgetting its name, promises a river drying to dust, promises a child unmade. [218]
I assemble the sax, each key a moon scale, each pad a sealed eyelid holding back weather. [235]
No tune will save us, only a silence set in a precise chord around the mouth of danger. [253]
I breathe until fog nests inside my chest and I can feel its subtle feathers. [268]
Then I lift the mouthpiece and whisper a note that is mostly air and old memory. [284]
The atrium catches it and splits it, sending pale ribbons through the mist like ghost handwriting. [300]
Between the ribbons, a throat of stillness appears, and there I aim my second breath. [315]
The code resists, climbing the stalactites, tapping them in sequences, implicating me by name. [329]
I answer with absence, proving the beat by removing it, turning the groove inside out. [344]
What remains is not a song but a frame, a contour where the prophecy cannot settle. [360]
Around the frame the droplets hesitate, then adopt my tempo, a slow and patient refusal. [375]
The grotto listens, stone pores opening like cautious bells, and the mist becomes a cathedral. [390]
Even the ferns lean as if reading the air, their spines aligning to the negative beat. [406]
I feel the vested hush settle across my shoulders, the old garment fitted by breath and doubt. [423]
The hush is not absence, but a clasp, a promise held shut long enough to melt its teeth. [441]
The code tries to pry it open, to name the child again, to reorder the river. [457]
So I guide the silence like a shepherd guides shadows, through negative space and toward the mouth. [474]
I whisper once more, but now I whisper without tone, shaping only breath in a careful oval. [491]
The oval fits the atrium's prism, and the light folds into it like a letter. [506]
Inside the fold, the prophecy stutters, unable to find the consonants it needs for its mouth. [522]
Its vowels spill into the pool, where fish nibble them into harmless bubbles that burst like nods. [539]
The grotto sighs, and something hidden in the rafters of stone remembers a gentler decade. [554]
I remember, too, the night I nearly answered the code and almost lost my name. [569]
Back then I wanted applause, a shine, yet the fog taught me a harder reverence. [584]
It taught me to leave holes in sound where truth could stand alone and be seen. [600]
Now I lower the horn, and the droplets keep my tempo without me, patient as monks. [616]
The atrium dims, and a beam brushes the floor like a hand blessing a sleeping brow. [632]
Across that light I can read what matters, printed by absence, a quietly vivid ledger of mercy. [649]
No praise marks my name, only the vesper mark of work done when no one watched. [665]
Beyond the mouth of the grotto, the town still sleeps, their houses blue with early trust. [681]
I pack the horn, the felt lining damp with fog and effort, and buckle the clasps. [697]
The prophecy will nap until next season, when dewdrops gather their alphabet again and try speaking. [713]
I will return then, as dewdrops form, to keep its mouth dressed in the vested hush. [729]
Until that morning, my whisper will ride the fog back to town, a small and faithful animal. [746]
I do not own the silence, but tonight it trusts my hands, and that is enough. [762]
I pause at the lip of stone, listen once more, and hear only water remembering how to fall. [780]
The hush stays vested, and the grotto keeps the rest, while I carry the empty frame home. [797]</story>
