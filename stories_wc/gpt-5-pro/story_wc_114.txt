<story>After fever breaks, the mountain weather station breathes like a patient unbound from tubes, its ribs of antennae rising into a thin aurora. [23]
My head cools along with the anemometers, and I step onto the metal grate with an ache that feels like auroral sorrow. [45]
I have come back to the console for one purpose only, to find the weight of a swallowed truth. [64]
Below, the valley waits for forecasts that might open or close roads, weddings, and the slow caravans of fuel up to our ridge. [87]
Inside, the fault-tolerant oracle hums, a jury-rigged cluster wrapped in wool to muffle the outgassing clicks of its old drives. [107]
It learned forecasting the way pain learns patience, by occupying margins where broken data stutter but do not fall silent. [127]
It is peripherally aware of tremors the seismometer barely notes, of pressure microflares, of the faint electric shiver before ice lets go. [149]
In my fever I dreamed of masts swaying like grasses, and woke to swaying certainties that would not hold when I stood. [171]
Luca used to tease me about faith in instruments, he of the field notebook and the delicate hand that could name a cloud by its drift. [197]
His last gift still hangs by my desk, a botanical illustration of alpine saxifrage, each vein traced like a contour line hiding in green. [221]
I see it now because the fever burned the usual tunnel from my sight, leaving gaps where the margins breathe. [241]
At the lower corner a graphite smudge blurs a note, as if a mittened thumb pushed winter over a thought Luca could not bear. [265]
The oracle notices my stare and clicks its relays like teeth reconsidering a bite. [279]
It learned my grief when I fed it the avalanche logs the night Luca did not return, and it has waited without hurry for me to ask. [306]
What did I swallow, I ask it, when the siren time came and I stayed my hand. [323]
It answers as wind, not words, starting the rimed vanes that have not moved since yesterday. [339]
The logbook opens to the day Luca mapped the cornice and argued with my model, sketching leaves and ridgelines interleaved. [359]
The oracle projects a faint grid over the botanical illustration, aligning stem to spur, vein to buried fracture. [377]
It says, if a machine can say anything, that we begin again by occupying margins, where the mind refuses but the body knows. [400]
So I pull the drawing down, soft with coal dust and winter breath, and hold it under the lamp. [419]
Near the smudge I can just make out a figure Luca was not supposed to draw, the location of a buried glide plane above the service road. [446]
He had promised the director to keep such maps off paper, and I had promised to keep him from trouble. [466]
When the readings rose past threshold I did not call, because he was still outside and the road was full of the wedding convoy climbing. [491]
I swallowed that truth with coffee and a grin for the camera that keeps the donors smiling at our clean instruments. [512]
Now the oracle weighs every microtremor since, assigns reliabilities, and asks if I am ready to find the weight of a swallowed truth. [535]
It shows me how to smudge the corner with a square of paper, lifting the loose graphite into a folded cradle. [556]
On the bench sits the desiccant scale, ridiculous and precise, good enough to weigh frost, good enough to weigh this. [576]
I release the cradle and watch the black dust pool, then settle, then declare the mass of my silence. [595]
It is a number near nothing, a feather against the storm, yet my chest heaves as if a glacier turned inside me. [617]
The oracle prints a line of probabilities and a time to warn, not yesterday, not never, but now, while the convoy still climbs. [640]
I take the microphone and open the channel that makes the valley tinny and close, and I speak without apology. [660]
I tell them of the marginal tremors and the likely glide, and I promise closures that will send curses up the mountain like smoke. [684]
Then I read the names of our instruments, and Luca's too, as if a roll call could anchor what has drifted. [705]
The aurora lifts a curtain behind the ridge, a bruise of color that hurts and heals in the same slow breath. [726]
I tape the illustration back to its board and pencil the uncovered number small, no longer willing to let snow cover the margin of truth. [751]
The oracle clicks, content not with absolution but with a cleaner model, and the weather station resumes its breathing. [770]
I stand at the rail, peripherally aware of the wind sifting old snow from the mast, and I do not look away. [792]</story>
