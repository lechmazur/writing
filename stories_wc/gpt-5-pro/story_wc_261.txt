<story>After the anesthesia wears off, I wake in the quiet tower at dawn. [13]
The world is held in a meteor hush that rings like distant glass. [26]
On the bedside table, a frosted hourglass exhales a pale breath, each grain a soft snow. [42]
I have sought closure all my life, and I have opened more wounds than I have closed. [59]
My motive is not cruelty but learning, to learn to read the stories in scars. [74]
I thought the procedure would end that need. [82]
Instead, when my eyelids lift, the potted fern in the window looks back, and its fronds speak into my mind by accident. [104]
I am accidentally telepathic with plants, and I did not ask for this translation. [118]
You went under to seal a wound, the fern says, but a displaced miracle slid along our roots and took up residence here. [141]
Its voice is green rain, shy and certain. [149]
The hourglass fogs again as if winter has returned to the bulb. [161]
My stomach aches where the sutures curve like a parenthesis around a story I cannot yet read. [178]
I need to know what the scar remembers, not just what it hides. [191]
On the tray someone left a paper cup upon a napkin, and the coffee rings have dried into concentric moons. [211]
I begin the old method, by examining coffee rings as if they were tree rings, a way to count weather and harm. [233]
My teachers thought me strange for reading tables the way others read palms, but tables never lied. [250]
The rings here tell of sleeplessness, of a hand that trembled at dawn, of a spoon that traced circles while waiting for me to wake. [275]
They whisper also of a slip, a transfer, a miracle that missed its mark and flowed into the next listening vessel. [296]
The next vessel was the tower itself, its roots of stone, and then the plants that braid the ledges and drink the light. [319]
If I want closure without the cruelty of opening, I must follow where it went. [334]
Where did it go, I ask, and the fern unfurls a map of moisture and dust. [350]
Down, it says, down through a service tunnel the janitors forgot, where roots stitch the darkness together. [367]
I swing my legs, and pain salts the floor with stars. [378]
I tip the frosted hourglass, letting new snow fall to measure the risk I am still willing to take. [397]
I tunnel down the throat of brick, and I can hear the ivy thinking, a hum like the ocean in a shell. [419]
The miracle is here, the ivy says, but it is not only yours, and we will not let you take it without reading us first. [444]
I kneel and lay my palm on the scar where a fallen shutter once split the vine, a raised seam the color of night. [468]
Teach me, I say, and it floods me with summers I did not live, with winters I only guessed at in other hands. [491]
The rush is like meteors passing in velvet air, the very pattern of a meteor hush given shape. [509]
I can see how violence was weather, how healing was river, how memory braided itself into bark without pleading for notice. [530]
The ivy breathes, and the tower breathes with it, and in that shared breath I understand the bargain. [548]
To reclaim the displaced miracle, I must open one more wound, but with consent, and only enough to make a door. [569]
I ask the old elm that anchors the stair foot, and its leaves answer yes, yes, yes, the syllables a soft rain on my skull. [594]
I let my pocket knife kiss its bark, and sap rises like a sigh, amber and patient. [611]
The hourglass gives up its last white tear, and the tunnel breath below grows cool. [626]
Something loosens, a stitch in air, and I feel the miracle unlace from the roots and pool in the wound without closing it. [649]
The elm remembers every storm while healing, and it teaches me to do the same. [664]
My own scar warms, but it does not vanish; instead it opens like a book that stays intact even as its pages are turned. [688]
I see the night I made the first cut, the day I stitched a stranger, the hour I failed my father, and the minute I promised to do better. [717]
Every memory holds, because reading is not tearing, and repair does not demand erasure. [731]
I flip the knife shut and press my palm to the elm and to my own bandage, and I thank it for the lent miracle. [756]
When I climb back to my room, dawn has bloomed into morning, and the tower windows glitter like healed skin. [776]
I will seek closure, but no longer by opening; I will listen to the stories in scars, and I will read them in rings. [800]</story>
