<story>Rain sounded like distant pencil scratches on the decommissioned radar dome. [11]
Aurel, an urbane calligrapher with ink under his nails and city light in his posture, stood in the hush left behind by a heated argument. [36]
Even now the air held meteor hush, as if the dome remembered tracking skies too wide for anger. [54]
He touched the campfire story stick that leaned against a crate, its char-blackened grooves polished by many palms. [72]
He had carried it from town to town to explore ethical storytelling, and tonight it felt heavier than wood. [91]
Across the empty chamber his troupe's bunraku frames waited, puppets slack as sleeping ideas. [105]
Ferro had shouted that he was manipulating the crowd, and Miri had answered that every story manipulates. [122]
He had listened, uncommonly serene on the outside, though his chest carried a hive of second thoughts. [139]
The argument dissolved, the door clanged, and their footsteps released echoes that seemed to venture out and never return. [158]
Aurel stayed because silence is a tool, and he knew how to write with it. [173]
He spread a coil of vellum on a metal table and drew a single line that trembled like an artery. [193]
Half-lit epiphanies, he thought, are the honest kind, bright enough to navigate by but dim enough to keep you humble. [213]
He wrote Listen on the vellum, then wrote it again in reverse, letters mirrored so the word would read correctly only in reflection. [236]
That was the point he wanted to make: that power should see itself before it speaks. [252]
He planned to show it through subversive puppet shows in seedy bars, where the room holds equal parts laughter and wounded pride. [274]
But somewhere along the road from bravado to nuance, he had forgotten to ask his troupe to consent to his experiments. [295]
The dome curved overhead like a skullcap, gathering their earlier words and cooling them into fossils. [311]
Near the hatch a moth tapped against a barricaded window, a soft percussion that asked for a different ending. [330]
Aurel lifted the campfire story stick and felt how the scars along its length formed notches like tally marks. [349]
Every notch had a night attached, a face, a wrong turn corrected while someone else was talking. [366]
If he wanted to explore ethical storytelling, he would need to place authority where the heat was not: in the audience. [387]
He sent a message to Ferro and Miri, asking them to come back, promising that the launch would wait until they had written the rules together. [413]
Then he brewed kettle coffee on a camping stove and rehearsed how the first show would begin. [430]
The stick would pass from a stranger to a puppet and back, voice following wood, not wood following voice. [449]
Aurel would sit behind the screen and ink prompts on a scroll as the audience chose which scenes deserved light. [469]
If anyone wished an image erased, he would reverse it in shadow, unmake it, and let the puppet bow out with dignity. [491]
When their footsteps returned, they came quieter than before, as if they too had been listening to the moth. [510]
Miri took the stick first and set it across her knees, and Ferro watched Aurel as though weighing a coin he was tired of carrying. [535]
Aurel apologized without poetry, because some words should be printed in plain type. [548]
He said the show had forgotten to ask whether it harmed the people who carried it, and that the forgetting was his. [570]
Miri breathed out and nodded, and Ferro scratched the back of his neck and told the moth it could stay for the meeting. [593]
They wrote the new rules on the vellum, lines swelling and thinning with their pulses. [608]
Any witness could call for a pause, any puppet could refuse a scene, and the stick chose who spoke next by the audience's will. [632]
Only when they stepped out into the night did they realize the dome had been holding its breath with them. [652]
The first bar still smelled of old beer and citric cleanser, but the owner granted them a corner and a flickering work light. [675]
They began, not with a fable, but with a question the room could fold its hands around. [692]
When the first drunk grabbed the campfire story stick, he surprised himself by waiting for his turn to speak. [711]
Miri's puppet declined a punchline that cut too deep, and Aurel inked a soft strikeout that left the bruise legible but not celebrated. [734]
The story moved like a tide pool, slow and clear, everyone watching their own reflections flicker. [750]
In that minor light Aurel felt the dome inside his chest widen, a patient auditorium that could hold many kinds of truth. [772]
Back at the decommissioned radar dome after closing time, the three of them sat in easy quiet, the old machines asleep, the night once more in meteor hush. [800]</story>
