<story>On the day that refused to name itself, I returned to the living bridge garden I had grown to map the impossible. [22]
I am a hedge maze designer, but the hedges here breathe, braid, and remember. [36]
The bridges are living roots trained into arches that carry you above your own footprints. [51]
I returned because an old brief had resurfaced in my desk, tea-stained and stamped with Timeframe: None. [68]
It was the only commission whose motive matched my own: to discover the texture of time. [84]
The brief asked me to grow a maze that would not end, and I read that as a vow rather than a schedule. [107]
So I tuned my diagrams through hyperbolic geometry, curving hedges into negative space until paths multiplied like coral. [125]
Every junction refused Euclid and answered instead to breath, sap, and pulse. [137]
I carried a packet of fading photographs to consult the garden's childhood, each image blanching a little more whenever I looked. [158]
The first showed the nursery beds, cords of fig lashed into tentative spans over shallow culverts. [174]
The second remembered a winter when frost stenciled lace on the leaves and my breath made tiny planets. [192]
The last was nearly blank, a ghostly smear of willow where the heart of the maze should be. [210]
Between the roots of the central span, I found what I had been pretending not to remember: a halo fragment caught in the bark, dull as a coin rubbed thin. [240]
It used to crown a statue of a clockmaker saint toppled by a storm, the bronze body eaten by moss, the circle split and swallowed by growth. [267]
I pried the shard free, and the root groaned the way wood does when time is bent too hard. [286]
As soon as the halo fragment touched my palm, the paths returned to how they had been years and minutes ago and also did not. [311]
A wind unfurled from the center like a held breath let go, and I stepped forward into a quaking reverie. [331]
Every bridge I crossed remembered a different crossing, and each footfall braided with the sound of another, earlier footfall. [350]
I was retrocognitively trapped, not in a single past but in the garden's entire rehearsal of itself. [367]
When I unfolded the photographs to ask for bearings, the faces and leaves on them faded faster, as if the garden were reclaiming its own light. [393]
The first image lost a shadow, then a trellis, then a wet bootprint I had loved, and flakes of emulsion began to disintegrate like ash. [418]
I told myself to quit touching the past, but the halo shard warmed and pulsed as if demanding a center. [438]
If the brief had promised Timeframe: None, perhaps the only honest answer was to give the garden none to anchor, not even the mylar ghosts I carried. [465]
So I followed the negative curves my blueprints once traced, the way a conch shell follows a rule without caring what it reveals. [488]
The halo fragment became a lodestone for each impossible turn, tugging me through hollows of cedar and across roots as thick as torsos. [511]
Birds nested above and beneath at once, and their calls echoed like ink dropped into water, black ripples spreading across years. [532]
At the heart, the willow bark had grown into a chamber, ribbed and furred, a lung of green shadow. [551]
I set the fragment on a plate of cambium that the tree kept slick and new, as if always beginning. [571]
The garden shivered, and old rain hammered the leaves though the sky was dry and bright like bone. [589]
I breathed with it, the way divers match the sea, and I told the maze what I had never said aloud. [610]
I did not build you to trap me; I built you so I could touch the grain of duration without breaking it. [632]
I asked the shard to teach me and to leave me, in whatever order it required. [648]
It brightened, not with light but with steadiness, and then it began to disintegrate into dust so fine it hummed. [668]
The dust sank into the cambium, and an afterimage of the circle rose in the bark like a gill. [687]
My photographs, now nearly white, flashed with one last crispness, then cleared to paper as unmarked as snow. [705]
I saw their missing details not as loss but as the furrow where new knowing could take root. [723]
The garden's breath steadied, and the bridges no longer doubled themselves, though a tenderness of echo remained. [740]
I walked out along a root-ribbed arch that had carried me here in a hundred rehearsals, and this time it carried me once. [763]
No hour announced itself, and that was right, because what I carried was not a clock but a felt pattern, an inward weave. [786]</story>
