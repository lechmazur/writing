<story>The first tide bell woke me inside the gargantuan shell we call home. [13]
I am the insomniac poet appointed to hear what the walls remember. [25]
They remember storms and lullabies and wars our elders fold into supper prayers. [38]
They remember the ache that lasted across centuries of longing. [48]
That ache is why I cannot sleep, and why I write. [59]
My motive is simple and ferocious, to photosynthesize pain into beauty. [70]
I drink the dark and exhale petals, or try to. [80]
This morning, a galaxy postcard had drifted under my door like a tide leaf. [94]
Its picture showed a spiral of stars, but its ink held a map. [107]
The map traced rooms I had not walked, secret curls inside the shell. [120]
On the back, one line asked me to negotiate a blossom armistice. [132]
Blossoms here are not decorations; they are factions, dialects, and weather. [143]
Some open like laughter; others unsheathe thorns the way soldiers bare teeth. [155]
For years, they have skirmished in the chambers, bruising colors into dusk. [167]
The postcard pulsed heat, shyly unstoppable as a sprout cracking stone. [178]
I pressed my ear to it and heard a voice like rain on linen. [192]
Meet them at the Spiral Choir, it said, via half-sung lullabies carried on an off-key wind. [208]
The wind would ferry my proposal through corridors where feet could not go. [221]
I gathered chalk, my small drum, and the tint of bruised hibiscus. [233]
Before leaving, I ensconce the galaxy postcard in the pocket above my heart. [246]
The stairs spiral down past murals of failed truces and moss that sings. [259]
In the antechamber, the Guard of Petals stops me, his armor woven from calyx. [273]
He remembers my face from midnight errands and lets me pass. [284]
Sleep avoids me, I say, but peace has been avoiding us longer. [296]
He nods, eyes wet, and mutters something about his mother and thorns. [308]
At the Spiral Choir, the acoustics bow like trees in a salt wind. [321]
I set my drum on the floor and draw a circle of chalk. [334]
Then I breathe hibiscus, and voices begin to arrive, petaled and wary. [346]
Red speaks in coughs; white sings in sighs; thorn clicks like flint. [358]
I start the lullaby, though my pitch is crooked as a crab path. [371]
The song threads the corridor, shyly unstoppable, tugging the wind to duty. [383]
I sing our history, not pretty, but honest, and stitch it with wishes. [396]
I sing the people turned from each other by fear, then back again. [409]
The blossoms quiver, remembering names they hid inside their layered throats. [420]
You want a blossom armistice, red says, but what of old winter debts. [433]
White whispers that memory is a knife that also carves bowls for soup. [446]
Thorn rattles and asks if peace means no edges, no defense, no grit. [459]
I tell them edges belong, but they must stop craving blood for proof. [472]
Proof can be bloom shared with those who remember your frost-stung nights. [484]
The wind carries my half-sung notes to balconies where wounded leaves hide. [496]
It carries them into the guardrooms, and out to the reef-shadow joy beyond. [509]
People hush, shells hush, even the stinging anemones hush around the vents. [521]
The lullaby becomes a treaty draft, drawn in petals and breath and chalk. [534]
I raise the postcard; stars whirl through its paper like seeds unspooled. [546]
It is a witness, sent by cousins far afloat, reminding us of scale. [559]
We are small but not mean to be small, I say, and wait. [572]
Red unfurls a quiet petal; white folds a thorn inward; the click softens. [585]
The wind buries the hush deep, then brings us voices from farther rooms. [598]
Old gardeners who grew armor ask to join us, and I let them. [611]
They carry sickles turned to harps, and seed catalogs scarred by rain. [623]
Together we propose a season that breathes in and out without war. [635]
Together we write the blossom armistice as vows any petal can keep. [647]
No slashing for pride, no exile for color, no hunger for pain. [659]
There will be pruning, but for light; there will be thorns, but thoughtful. [672]
We store the vow inside the postcard, and the paper fattens into bark. [685]
I feel the shell adjust its posture, as if at last it breathes. [698]
Water clicks the outer ribs, and children run, splashing, their shoes flowering. [710]
My insomnia does not leave, but it loosens its fists, and listens. [722]
When night returns, I lie by the Choir and practice sleeping without closing. [735]
Above me, constellations on the postcard flare, then fade, as if breathing, too. [748]
We have not solved everything, but the first morning after, buds hold. [760]
They open when the sun speaks, and close when the moon jokes softly. [773]
In the gargantuan shell, the ache becomes music, and music becomes food. [785]
I go on writing, shyly unstoppable, because joy is a reef with shadows. [798]</story>
