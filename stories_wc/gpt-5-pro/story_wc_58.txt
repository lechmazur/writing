<story>After the last ship sails, I walk the silent quay until the gulls sound like hinges. [16]
I am a traveler who writes obituaries for the living, hired where grief outpaces news. [31]
Tonight the palace steward seats me in a shadowed garden in autumn, with lanterns veiled by vines. [48]
The air carries lonesome splendor, like brass polished by tears and patience. [60]
On the table lies a palace carpet weft thread, dark red, coiled as if it remembered the loom. [78]
The steward says it was pulled from a corridor rug during the evacuation when the harbor emptied. [95]
He wants obituaries that will be explained absences, portraits of survivors whose bodies remain while their lives have departed. [114]
I accept because I want to understand the geography of healing by walking its unmapped coasts. [130]
My work is done by projecting presence, stepping into rooms I cannot reach, breathing for those who will not speak. [150]
I write in a vividly descriptive hand, so the living can recognize themselves and forgive the stranger who names them. [170]
From the hedges steps Mira, the steward's daughter, whose husband took the last berth and waved without color. [188]
She asks me to write for him while he yet breathes across an ocean, to spare her the ache of waiting. [209]
Leaves scissor down, bronze on slate, and the garden's shadows fold and unfold like the stiff pleats of mourning attire. [229]
I lift the palace carpet weft thread and tie it around my finger, a tether to what cannot return. [248]
Closing my eyes, I send myself along its length, and by projecting presence I enter the ship's small galley. [267]
Salt fog beads on tin, knives breathe iron, and the bread remembers the heat that birthed it. [284]
Yet the stool where he once sat is empty, a shape held in place by untold stories. [301]
I return and intimate what I have seen, not as certainty, but as a compass slowly thawing. [318]
Mira nods, adding small grains of truth, the chipped mug, the scar that catches rain, the laugh nobody else hears. [338]
Together we compose his obituary for the living, a lantern hung where a door will not open again. [356]
It joins the registry of explained absences, papers the city files under Compassion, to be read when the tide falters. [376]
Word spreads among the benches where the old men play chess by starlight, and more petitioners arrive like owls. [395]
I write for a baker whose ovens cooled when the storms ended trade, and for a teacher who lost students to departure. [417]
Each piece I draft pins another street to my map, knotted by the thread now smudged with fingerprints. [435]
The geography of healing begins to surface like riverbeds in drought, showing ribs of stone and bottles flowering with message. [455]
I learn that healing is not a return, but a migration that confuses the compass until new north grows credible. [475]
At night I loosen the palace carpet weft thread and string it between rose canes to sketch currents of departure. [495]
Then I walk along it by projecting presence into rooms where lamplight halos dust and letters wait unstamped. [513]
It occurs to me that I have no reader and every reader, for I also am leaving without leaving. [532]
So beneath a fig that shades the broken fountain, I begin to write my own living obituary as practice for a return. [554]
In it I intimate the absences I have explained for others, and how mine unspools whenever I borrow their voices. [574]
I admit I travel to understand the geography of healing because my heart is a coastline rewritten by storms. [593]
There will be no ship tomorrow, so I will stay until the thread ends or the roses accept their thorns. [613]
Mira returns with a letter tucked in her sleeve, the paper smelling of smoke, the ink slumped like tired soldiers. [633]
He writes he has found work mending harbors upriver and will not return, but he has sent seeds for their empty beds. [655]
We plant them in the shadowed garden in autumn, pressing hope into soil that holds more names than bones. [674]
In weeks, shoots arrive like green handwriting, curling around the thread until the path of grief becomes legible. [692]
I realize that staying does not halt travel, for I can carry their stories across horizons by projecting presence. [711]
Night swells, and the garden hums with lonesome splendor, a quiet choir of leaves rehearsing the future. [728]
With the palace carpet weft thread, I stitch my map until the city understands, and absence grows intimate with mercy. [748]</story>
