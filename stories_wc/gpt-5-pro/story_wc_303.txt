I am a provenance researcher with hands practiced at weighing evidence and a heart trained to pretend. [17]
Tonight I work in the velvet observatory at midsummer, where night smells of wool and cosmic dust. [34]
The donors will gather at dawn, sipping frosted champagne while an empire rebrands theft as heritage. [50]
I came early to weigh a dream against an empire, alone with the instrument that has unmoored me. [68]
It rests on velvet like a small moon, a transparent violin made of ice crystal, cold as confession. [86]
Inside, a ribbon of light hums like a vow waiting to be kept. [99]
I have to decide before the promise loses its glow. [109]
This is not how my trade works, but my trade never learned my other method. [124]
Years ago I became accidentally telepathic with plants when a hurricane rearranged the library roof. [139]
A dripping ficus told me its memories as rain formed brown galaxies on my desk. [154]
Since then I read the future in coffee stains, and the leaves nod or shiver agreement. [170]
By reading the future in coffee stains, I trace the perforated destiny punched into every choice. [186]
The stains are maps with torn edges, inviting a thumb to tear along the blessed line. [202]
But tonight even the desk fern whispers of music, of sap that wants frost to speak. [218]
To discover provenance is to ask who promised what to whom, and who kept the promise. [234]
The mountain people who carved this violin from ice crystal sent it down the river with a pledge. [252]
Play us when summer scorches the old guilt away, they said, and return our winter in song. [269]
An empire seized the pledge and put it under glass, calling it eternal rather than melting. [285]
My museum is the empire's favored alibi, silk gloves on hands still raw with conquest. [300]
I am supposed to authenticate the chain of ownership, initials and seals and the weight of signatures. [317]
Instead I ask the night jasmine what it remembers of ash and river ice. [331]
It answers in a mulberry ache, a bruised scent that catches in the hinge of breath. [347]
Your hands can propagate what truth the empire cannot catalog, it says, and we will carry it. [364]
I feel the vines in the courtyard loosen their sleep, ready to braid sound into rootwork. [380]
If I play, the ice will melt, and the donors will be left with water and shame. [397]
If I do not, the empire will own another winter and call it care. [411]
So I set out the saucers and pour coffee until the surface shines like an eclipse. [427]
In the pooled darkness I see perforations, a dotted arch leading down to a river gap. [443]
The jasmine thrums, the ficus taps the window, the ivy names the stations of return. [458]
All maps point to a single uncut line that my thumb now cannot resist. [472]
I lift the transparent violin made of ice crystal and the bow that smells like old pine. [489]
The first note is winter glare, the second a buried kiss, the third a question pointed inland. [506]
I play until the instrument is a river inside my hands, and the room rains. [521]
Sound moves out, and the plants propagate it through their netted city, root to root, leaf to leaf. [539]
The message is simple and impossible to catalog, return what you promised when you took what melted. [556]
At the door the director pauses because the night jasmine has tangled his ankle with a soft insistence. [574]
He hears nothing but notices damp velvet, and he frowns like weather learning itself. [588]
I am already gone, following the dotted arch in my stain map to the morning river. [604]
The violin is a handful of shining rivulets, slipping my fingers to baptize the stones. [619]
I scoop the cold into the current and listen as the city roots answer with green applause. [636]
Behind me the observatory bells the hour, a velvet hum that blesses what is leaving. [651]
I have done what I came to do, to weigh a dream against an empire, and decide. [668]
The decision hurts, yes, but the hurt is mulberry ache, thick sweet and stained with sky. [684]
The plants keep singing the memory forward, a lineage of leaves promising winter wherever summer forgets. [700]
And when the donors lift their flutes at dawn, they drink the river and wonder why it tastes like truth. [720]
I walk the bank until the stain map dries, its perforations gone, its line now part of the world. [739]
My hands cool, my heart quits pretending, and the promise, having been kept, keeps its glow. [755]
