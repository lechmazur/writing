<story>I wake in the murmur of half-remembered dreams, where engines still whisper behind my eyelids. [15]
On the concrete lip of an abandoned spaceport repair bay, I wait for the world to align. [32]
I am a sensory map maker, charting smell, taste, heat, and vibration as others chart coasts. [48]
My craft exists to discover the weight of a withheld truth, not with scales but with routes. [65]
The routes braid like threads, weaving between worlds until their tension pulls meaning from resistance. [80]
I arrived because a whisper from a machine said the truth I seek grew heavy here. [96]
The bay opens like a ribcage, rusted gantries arching over a floor cracked by thermal tides. [112]
A green glass shard glints in a puddle of old coolant, brighter than it should be. [128]
I pocket it because my maps begin with touch, and the shard hums like captive summer. [144]
Every cycle, my leaps come unbidden, cyclically spontaneous as if time itself breathes in patterns. [159]
When the breath comes, I let it carry me, and the world blurs along scent lines. [175]
Here, the coolant smells of mint and burned dust, a flavor of delayed intentions. [189]
I follow it into the crooked shadows beneath a maintenance cradle and lay my ear to metal. [206]
The bay remembers voices better than any archive, because vibration never forgets its own corridors. [221]
I tap the green glass shard against the cradle, a delicate chime, then another, and listen. [237]
Chimes map the hollows like sonar, but to me they also braid taste and color onto air. [254]
The braid shows three faint paths, each slightly offset, like fingerprints pressed from parallel hands. [269]
I split my attention and slip where the scents diverge, through parallel universes that overlay this hall. [286]
One world keeps the lights burning, one floods the floor with black rain, and one holds silence. [303]
The silence aches with mass, as if the withheld truth itself were anchored to the ceiling. [319]
I climb the gantry in the quietest strand, palms tasting iron, and wedge the shard into a seam. [337]
It refracts a thin beam from nowhere, and the beam draws letters on the wall like frost. [354]
The letters are logs of a last repair, a record scrawled by someone who tasted what I taste. [372]
They say the station supervisor ordered a shutdown to redirect a cargo, and called it a kindness. [389]
The cargo was a sealed container of voices gathered from refugees along a collapsing migration corridor. [405]
They feared the voices would ignite panic if released, and so they shelved them in this bay. [422]
Weight is a measure of pull, the log continues, and withheld truth pulls lives into smaller orbits. [439]
I feel the pull in my teeth, a gravity of unsaid names bending my balance. [454]
To measure it, I open my map kit and fit the shard into a prism of nerve-wire. [471]
The device drinks the beam and exhales a taste like sea glass thawing on the tongue. [487]
I swallow it and let the cycles take me, because the data must be woven across versions. [504]
I pass through parallel universes again, each presenting the same crate with a different temperature of fear. [521]
In one, technicians huddle and argue; in another, they hum lullabies to the sealed hinges. [536]
I taste the lullabies as thyme and solder, and chart how the harmonics pin sorrow in place. [553]
At the loop's apex, my cyclic impulse surges, and I choose to redirect the current of fear. [570]
I unseal the crate not with tools but with attunement, matching breath to the recorded breaths inside. [587]
When the lock yields, thousands of voices spill without sound, a draft that smells like rain before summer. [605]
They slide into me and through me, weaving between worlds as if my throat were their corridor. [622]
I guide them by flavor, redirect them toward the channels of public address in each adjacent bay. [639]
In every universe, speakers crackle, and the withheld truth arrives as names, dates, coordinates, pleas, and gratitude. [656]
The weight lifts from the ceiling and spreads across the floor like a shallow, luminous tide. [672]
It is lighter because it can be carried by many rather than anchored by few. [687]
I taste relief as green tea and cold iron, and the shard dims to a calm ember. [704]
I leave it set in the seam, a bead in the loom that will steady later menders. [721]
My maps redraw themselves, not as routes to secrets, but as channels for what deserves to move. [738]
I know now the origin of my cycles, seeded by those who feared chaos more than distortion. [755]
They built me to be a bridge, and bridges do not hoard weight; they distribute it. [771]
So I walk the gantry until the murmur returns, and let the breath tip me outward again. [788]</story>
