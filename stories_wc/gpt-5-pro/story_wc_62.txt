<story>The ancient greenhouse at dusk hummed with a thundering calm as I set the stone on the workbench. [18]
I am a thoughtful gravestone carver, slow of hand and fiercely meditative, the kind who listens before any chisel dares to speak. [40]
The panes were fogged with the breath of plants older than the village, and the iron ribs creaked whenever the wind remembered their age. [64]
I came night after night across the butterfly migration, when the air itself lifted and folded, and the glass roofs turned gold with wings. [88]
My reason was a simple oath to discover the shape of collective grief, and to cut it faithfully so others could lay their hands upon it. [114]
The town had asked for no names, only a sheltering stone for many losses, and I chose the greenhouse because sorrow grows where life insists on staying. [141]
From my satchel I drew a woven ribbon roll, the kind used to tag rare vines, and I set it beside the chisels like a compass. [167]
I would tie lines of color to stalks and trellises, then trace them across the bench, translating stem to stone until an unseen figure stepped forward. [193]
When I lifted the mallet, the first blow was not mine, but the echo of a taut wrist that belonged to my grandmother. [216]
She had carved through two wars and a fever year, and her guidance arrived as spectral mentorship that pressed behind my shoulder, steady, invisible, undeniable. [241]
Under that hush, my thoughts did not scatter but pooled, and I felt both instructed and judged by the patience I had inherited. [264]
We had a family custom of trading favorite poems at dinner, and after she died the table kept its rituals like a clock without hands. [289]
In the greenhouse, I renewed that custom each evening, reciting lines into the leaves, while her answers came in the measured pauses between drops from the misting pipes. [317]
She would offer some stanza she had once loved, and the butterflies, settling along the rafters, would shiver as if punctuation had traveled through their thin bones. [344]
With those poems as coordinates, the ribbon became a guide, and I began to retrace the path of each voice the town had lost. [368]
I tied a line for the singing baker between two fig trees, another for the ferry captain along the rusted gutter, and another for the school janitor. [395]
Each strand crossed another, and the crossings taught me that the shape of collective grief was not a single curve but a braid that held. [420]
I carved where the ribbon intersected shadow, easing the chisel so the stone accepted a corridor of light, and the greenhouse breathed approval through its damp lungs. [447]
The blows were gentle thunder, a private storm under glass, and every pause returned to me in calm, as if silence itself were anvil and balm. [473]
Sometimes townsfolk came, leaving folded notes with a line they liked, a meal they missed, a smell they wished to keep, and I braided those, too. [499]
They stood amid the figs and cucumbers and closed their eyes, and my grandmother stood with them, unseen, making room in the air for their telling. [525]
Spectral mentorship did not give answers but steadiness, a discipline of breath, a way to listen for the living syllables that grief hides when it hardens. [551]
On the heaviest evening, when the last monarchs gathered like charred leaves along the mesh vents, I asked her how to finish what had no edge. [577]
She answered with a poem about hands, then told me to loosen the braid, to let it fall open so the gaps could glow. [601]
I obeyed, untying the woven ribbon roll and letting its colors slacken between ferns, and I cut channels in the stone where the hollows demanded attention. [627]
When I finally rinsed the dust, the slab did not proclaim, it received, and faces relaxed as if a long held breath had found a doorway. [653]
We held a supper among the benches, and everyone traded favorite poems at dinner, voices circling like moths, while the butterflies outside lifted in a last radiant cloud. [681]
Afterward I wiped the mallet, rewound the ribbons, and promised to return next season, to retrace the braid as new losses joined, and to keep the thundering calm. [709]</story>
