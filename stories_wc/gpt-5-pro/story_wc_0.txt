<story>After the flood, I unlocked the storm-damaged greenhouse with hands still tasting of salt and metal. [16]
I am a neutron star researcher, but today my sky is made of ripped plastic and shivering glass. [34]
The bench slats are white with silt, the beds black with rot, and the orchids hold their breath. [52]
I came for measurement, not mourning, driven by a need to strip needless drama from our next steps. [70]
That habit of mind preprocesses reality into gradients I can follow, like riverbeds left in the air. [87]
Not everything is a cliff; most of the world is a slope, and slopes are where work happens. [105]
I learned that from stars that spin down by whisper, not by scream, losing light through slow, dignified decay. [124]
In here the decay is less dignified, but it rhymes, and rhyme is enough to begin. [140]
I start with the panes, where every gust wrote a line and every drip punctuated it. [156]
There is dust from butterfly wing stuck along the fractures, a faint bronze that refuses to be scrubbed away. [175]
The flood churned the lepidopteran air into the greenhouse and then drained, leaving constellations too small for sky. [193]
Through accumulated dust patterns I can read which vents failed first and where the wind pressed hardest. [210]
The wings were once gentle, but the flood taught them to write; now their dust draws me a map. [229]
My colleagues would call this forensic meteorology, but to me it is no different from timing a pulsar. [247]
You look for the clean beat underneath the storm, and you build from it, patient as lichen. [264]
I mark with chalk the window seams that will need replacement, and I number trays that can survive. [282]
Where the dust gathers thickest, the frames bowed, and the orchids drank brine when they wanted mist. [299]
I save the ones least dramatic, the ones still green at the heart, because drama is expensive and time is poor. [320]
Outside, the river still moves debris like a slow parade, a drumline of plastic and branches and patience. [338]
I have data to salvage too, the drowned notebooks of a botanist who shared this place with me at lunch. [358]
She taught me the names of the orchids and laughed at my star names, and now both catalogs blur. [377]
I dry her pages by the dim light that still finds the cracked roof, weighing each sheet with a stone. [397]
It feels like slowing a collapse I cannot stop, like taking spin from a star and giving it to a seed. [418]
The community wants a report, not a sermon, so I draft one with a tone of kindled humility and clear requests. [439]
We will replant tomatoes and orchids, replace only the eastern panes, and reopen at half light and half hours. [458]
We will start ventilation with hand fans and window gaps before we buy motors, because gradual change holds. [476]
I prefer to test a slope before investing in a cliff, and the training of a neutron star researcher agrees. [496]
When night comes I set the radio on the potting table and listen to the beacons that survived. [514]
Some lighthouses still sweep, some buoys still blink, and somewhere a pulsar ticks, patient as a teacher. [531]
I think of all that spins down and stays useful, how decay can be a form of giving back. [550]
The butterflies did not intend to be scribes, but their residue maps the new angles of the wind, and we learn. [571]
The greenhouse will not be what it was, and we will not pretend; we will tune it to the slope we have. [593]
In my lab the software smooths noise, here my eyes do it, chasing coherence along stained glass. [610]
I tape the worst cracks and leave the tiny ones, trusting the air to teach us which matter. [628]
The botanist arrives with tea, her boots dark with river lines, and we plan our triage like gardeners. [646]
We decide what to compost and what to clean, letting decay be partner rather than enemy in this place. [665]
The orchids that survive will seed the next house, and the dead will feed them, a closed wild arithmetic. [684]
My report ends with a curve, a schedule of repair that rises softly, proof that gradual change wins. [702]
It is less heroic than a vow, but it keeps the doors open, and it honors what remains. [720]
The morning after the report, children press their palms to the panes and watch the fish in the puddles. [739]
I show them the dust maps like star charts, and they learn to steer by windows, not only by suns. [759]
When a breeze slips through our tape, the dust lifts and resettles, and our plan refines itself without fuss. [778]
We keep working, stripping needless drama, tending the slope, and the greenhouse begins to feel like a star made humble. [798]</story>
