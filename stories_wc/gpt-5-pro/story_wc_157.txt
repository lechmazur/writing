<story>After thoughts become taxable, the air turned cashier, folding every stray idea into ledgers we never asked for. [18]
We met in the entomologist's greenhouse because it hummed louder than microphones and smelled like wet soil secrets learning to breathe. [39]
I was there to stand guard over your own spark of defiance, which meant guarding mine, too. [56]
But the orbiting star was Ilya, a charming rogue scholar who introduced rules like rumors and obeyed them like jokes. [76]
Ilya spoke in a candidly cryptic register, clearing meaning as if it were fogged glass and then writing something unexpected behind it. [98]
We called ourselves a secret language club, less to hide than to practice courage in syntax. [114]
Our method was joining community gardens to plant message patterns, letting petals and trellises argue about what a sentence could be. [135]
Ilya placed a gourd rattle seed on the potting bench, its dry heart clicking when the beetles trembled. [153]
This is our metronome, Ilya said, and the bugs nodded by accident, which felt like consent. [169]
The Bureau audited laughter next, so timing mattered more than harmony. [180]
We bent wire frames and would warp the cedar trellises, teaching vines to angle into letters the drones could not price. [201]
Across the city we joined committees, swapped compost, and made the maps that looked innocent to anyone who had never read a meadow. [224]
It was not rebellion, Ilya said, so much as grammar for bodies moving under tariffs. [239]
It was also shelter, because nobody taxes what they cannot count and nobody counts what blooms instead of speaks. [258]
The entomologist watched over us, pretending to catalog their mantises while tracking the hum of our lesson plans. [276]
They kept the heaters low to discourage microphones and brewed tea that made my ribs feel like slatted sunlight. [295]
The first pattern unfurled in spring, a ring of marigolds encircling kale like an amber iris watching the city blink. [315]
When the drones stitched their gridlines overhead, the bloom said WAIT to anyone fluent in pollinator, which included us and the wasps. [337]
One night a Notice of Arrears arrived, assessing me for unreported hypotheses and charging penalties for dreams with unfiled joy. [357]
I brought it to the greenhouse, where moths rehearsed on the glass like tiny drummers warming up the sky. [376]
Ilya rattled the gourd rattle seed and said, We will annotate this with stems, and make their numbers stutter. [395]
We drafted the answer in soil, joining community gardens to plant message patterns that resolved across districts like a moving reply. [416]
At dawn the marigolds bent, the beans curled, and the irrigation lines suggested commas where my fine should have ended. [436]
The Bureau sent collectors to the greenhouse, and the mantises posed like green knives beside the watering wands. [454]
Ilya smiled with courtly mischief, a candle in a storm, and welcomed them to our secret language club without blinking. [474]
Their questions were ropes; our answers were vines; everything tangled into converging chaos that still somehow climbed a trellis of sense. [495]
Ilya was candidly cryptic, explaining how to value a pause, how to itemize a hush, how to depreciate regret. [514]
The entomologist moved in the aisles like a librarian of wings, opening vents, and releasing ladybirds that glittered like punctuation. [534]
When the collectors stepped closer, Ilya shook the seed again, and the ants rose from the seed trays like a rumor taking legs. [557]
They marched through the spilled Notice of Arrears, smudging the ink into an ellipsis that refused to finish. [575]
We guided the bargaining into the garden, where the second pattern waited, a maze of sunflowers with shadows aligned like clockwork. [596]
Standing at the center, I read the sentence the shadows made, and asked the collectors to read it aloud. [615]
They squinted, because the words changed with the sun, and because admission requires your breath to be part of the text. [636]
The message said, We do not owe for lightning that visits the skull, and the wind carried payment in pollen. [656]
Behind us, the greenhouse glass began to warp with heat, sun pooled on water, and everything rang like nerves trying to whistle. [678]
The collectors retreated, which looked like thinking, which counted as taxable, and their faces realized the math just then. [697]
We let them leave owing only humility and the price of stepping carefully among living sentences. [713]
Back inside, Ilya tucked the gourd rattle seed into a paper envelope labeled Receipts, and we laughed tax free. [732]
We wrote our ledgers in roots and petals, with credits posted whenever a child asked the bees for directions. [751]
There was no anthem, only a rhythm, the candidly cryptic clatter of jars and seed trays and unbilled thoughts returning to balance. [773]
We kept studying, not to win, but to keep that spark alive, and to know when to be silent and when to bloom. [796]</story>
