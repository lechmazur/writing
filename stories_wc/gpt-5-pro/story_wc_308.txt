<story>The canyon opens around me like a throat, towers of bone in a canyon of endless echoes, and I stand listening for the oldest tremor. [25]
I am a harmonic stone skimmer by calling, historically reverent in practice, taught to read the world by the music of its own refusal. [49]
Today my motive is plain and stubborn, to learn to navigate without moving, to ride the map inside the echo instead of any path. [73]
I clutch a stone arrowhead that belonged to my grandmother, her tuning wedge, its tip chipped by questions sharper than hunger. [94]
She said the canyon keeps a pulse left wandering, a beat that forgot its body when the rains quit and the traders fled. [117]
I have come to appraise whether that stray rhythm still searches for a chest, whether it can be coaxed into pointing like a compass. [141]
My first act is always silence, then a test tap, the arrowhead kissing a rib of bone, setting ripples skating across petrified marrow. [164]
I listen with weathered resolve, letting their decays and overlaps sketch out distances, the canyon charting itself in diminishing syllables. [184]
Above, a ragged cloud of gulls sweeps between the spires, and I take my readings through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight. [209]
Their turns annotate the resonance like scribbles in a sainted margin, each veer and bank revealing where the echo drags or quickens. [231]
The canyon has served as ledger and liturgy, its towers of bone keeping count of hoofbeats, bargains, prayers, and the small generosities of thirst. [255]
Every note returns bearing grit, a date written as abrasion, a signature scuffed into me through centuries of layered dust. [275]
When the gulls knot as if a giant palm squeezes the sky, I feel the wandering pulse tug north, sullen, wary of being noticed. [299]
I do not chase it, because the lesson is motionless travel; I want the world to do the walking around my stillness. [321]
I remember my grandmother seated for hours with that arrowhead on her thigh, humming until the walls drifted closer like concerned relatives. [343]
She would appraise the bones as accountants appraise books, hunting for misstatements of time, for the places where mercy had forgotten to balance. [366]
Now I begin my own audit with a low drone that shivers the dust, a note just under breath, an invitation and a warning. [390]
The wandering pulse returns, sheepish, as if ashamed of desertion, and sidles into my tone until our two waves beat like mismatched hearts. [413]
I angle the stone arrowhead and shave the note, thinner, colder, listening for how the gulls stretch or tighten their distance from the bones. [437]
They flare, then braid, and I take that braid as a boundary; the pulse, impatient, strides there and will not step across. [459]
I appraise the cause, tasting the ash in the echo, and decide it is a barricade of forgetting laid by long-ago traders. [481]
They begged the canyon to keep their route secret, and so the pulse left wandering was cut from its host and set to pacing. [505]
I speak to it softly, historically reverent, promising no theft, only guidance, the way a shepherd guides by standing exactly where he must. [528]
It tests me with a stutter, and I hold the pitch steady, letting my stillness become a door the canyon can graciously swing. [551]
Above, the flock unknots and pours like ink toward a hollow seam, a seam the echoes called river once, before the river evaporated. [574]
The pulse follows, relieved, slipping into that remembered channel, and I remain motionless, navigating by what moves because I do not. [595]
The arrowhead warms in my palm, and I picture the traders counting beads, uncounted wrong, their fear folding the map into a cruel accordion. [619]
I hum a tally of forgiveness, each note a finger uncurling, and the bone towers, kindly accountants, record it without interest. [640]
The gulls settle in pale commas, and the canyon breathes a paragraph, then a chapter, and finally a book closing on its own spine. [664]
I do not move, yet I arrive at a clarity, for the wandering pulse now loops back as guide and not prisoner. [686]
The path draws itself like wet ink on dry hide, and I resist the old urge to chase, honoring the lesson of stillness. [709]
When I finally rise, it is not to walk but to bow, the canyon and I exchanging the brief gratitude owed between patient craftsmen. [733]
Then I seat myself again, and the arrowhead waits, because this map is never finished, and dust keeps writing, and the birds keep reading. [757]
I will appraise until night spines the world with chill, until the pulse is practiced at returning, until even forgetting remembers where to go. [781]</story>
