<story>After the universe contracts, we live on an ambered observatory deck where sunset is trapped in the railings. [18]
I am the cast lots decision maker, chosen when the clocks paused, because chance outlives courage and rituals steady breathing. [38]
I am quietly enthusiastic even as doubt flowers in the starless dark, because holding the role feels like warm gravity. [58]
My collection of foreign coins clinks like distant bells, each minted on worlds that collapsed into the same shrinking sky. [78]
I cast them into velvet bowls when choices threaten to swallow us, and the bowls answer with statistical mercy. [97]
The last recording from the old spectrum priests is a backwards prophecy, a message that unspools in reverse syllables and cold. [118]
I learned understanding static bursts the way sailors learn swells, by feeling patterns beat my ribs until meaning held fast. [138]
It says that the next beginning can be tuned, not built, that the newborn field wants a human voice to set its note. [161]
To wavelength align with purpose, we must sing through the relic arrays and let the universe hear what to remember. [181]
But the arrays thirst, and I distill coolant from amber residue that beads on the railings at dawn that is not dawn. [203]
On the ambered observatory deck, the stuff forms like tears from the deck plates, condensed memory of exploded winters and suns. [224]
Through a glass coil I coax it into a bottle, and the receiver forgives me by lowering its lonely hum. [244]
When I switch it on, the room brightens to old honey, and stellar doubt threads everything like the echo of burned chimes. [266]
I set the foreign coins on the console, each with a different hole or edge, each tuned to a vanished anthem. [287]
Gold from the tidal markets of Veleth hums in the left speaker, tin from a glacier moon tings in sympathetic whispers. [308]
Chance, my old anchor, is not just decision here; it is geometry, the spread of coins determining antenna impedance and luck. [329]
The backwards prophecy insisted we throw, then listen, then learn what we meant to say by where the metal came to rest. [351]
So I breathe, strike the rail twice for rhythm, and cast the lots across the deck until they glitter like starlings. [372]
They collide, spin, and stop; the pattern is a bowl shape, a mouth, a listening curve carved on the floor. [392]
The receiver gasps into song, not forward, but peeling backward, syllables swallowed into consonants, then to breath, then to pulse. [412]
I sit with my ear against the grill, understanding static bursts like weather, counting intervals until letters assemble from crackle. [432]
In reverse the prophecy tells me we already sang, that our future throats were kind, that we chose the note of care. [454]
But it says the note must be born from no one intention, only from the democratic scatter of gravity and hands. [475]
I am the cast lots decision maker, and my calling is to keep the scatter honest, to keep our longing from steering. [497]
So I gather the coins and throw again, this time naming choices in my heart, promises we might seed into the echo. [519]
A lullaby for strangers, an oath to forgive debt, a map of safe wells, a recipe for clean fire, a patient hello. [541]
The coins land heavy on the lullaby, thin on the oath, curious on the map, and they balance on the word hello. [563]
I translate that to mean we need gentleness, not amnesty; we need guidance, but first we must announce we are here. [584]
So I turn the dial until the static bursts tighten into a single ribbon, and we wavelength align with purpose like tuning forks. [607]
We sing a hello that is patient, a lullaby for strangers who will be us, our voices carried in amber breath. [628]
The receiver clears its throat, if machines have throats, and the room tastes of metal and honey and leaning possibility. [648]
I keep my hands steady, but stellar doubt keeps one finger on my heart, tapping a soft rhythm that never resolves. [669]
I distill the last drips from the coil, pour them into the cooling wells, and the array answers with a low bow. [691]
If this is faith, it tastes like waiting with tools, letting lots fall where they must, and trusting pattern where certainty failed. [713]
When the song finishes running backward, it leaves us standing forward, held by the amber, quiet, and angled toward beginning. [733]</story>
