<story>The dawn that finds me is borrowed, thin as breath over the sea. [13]
It is the hour after friction disappears, when everything slides toward prophecy. [25]
I am the elusive eel herder, and the shoals will not be held by nets. [40]
The rocks I once trusted no longer keep their place except where I choose them to. [56]
I learned a crude method, placing painted rocks in mathematical sequences along the tidal bluff under aurora. [73]
Patterns still grip even when friction will not. [81]
Each morning I arrange the stones into spirals of primes, then into ratios the eels seem to remember with their bodies. [102]
They climb the wet light as if the world still had edges. [114]
I am precognitively cursed, so I feel the futures sliding too, a thousand versions of my hands shivering around the same cold stone. [137]
There is a lingering promise that binds those hands, and I cannot let it go. [152]
Before the last spring, before the friction fled, she whispered that I would find a breath to hold the shore in place. [174]
I promised to return with that breath, and the promise hung in the air longer than the storm. [192]
Now I try to harness collapsed star dust that falls in faint drifts whenever the aurora cries. [209]
It settles in my hair and on the painted stones, heavy without weight, ash from a furnace above measure. [228]
With eel skins tied to my feet, I ride the slope as if steering a thought. [244]
Everything moves unless it is persuaded by pattern. [252]
So I place the rocks in primes along the lip, then Fibonacci inside, then a lattice of triangles to talk to the dust. [275]
I hum the numbers until they taste like salt. [284]
The eels feel it first, threading the sequences like dark needles through a sleeve of water. [300]
When their bodies align, the dust stirs and pools where the primes meet the triangles, and the air hardens enough to catch on. [323]
I scoop it with a bowl carved from driftbone, and it rings like a bell against itself. [340]
To carry it I whisper the promise again, because promises bind matter better than laws do now. [357]
Each repetition grants me a narrow road, invisible but present, and my feet stop sliding for as long as the word lasts. [379]
The villagers watch from the dunes and call me clever, but their voices skid away, and I cannot catch praise. [399]
They call me elusive, a trickster, the eel herder who vanished from their grip with the world itself. [417]
I am not elusive by choice; I am held at a slant by the futures that keep arriving early. [436]
Being precognitively cursed is like walking with wind as a leash, your steps tugged toward what has not yet happened. [456]
Sometimes a future shows me failing to keep the promise, and the bowl spills, and the dust becomes only shine. [476]
Other times I see the shore knitting itself again, grains locking like teeth, the eel ladder holding, the houses no longer slouching. [498]
In every vision she stands at the cliff and waits to breathe the same breath I will bring. [516]
It is not love alone, though love weaves through it; it is my need to understand sacred patterns that make and unmake weight. [539]
If I can hear the shape of gravity in the numbers, perhaps I can teach it to stay. [557]
Tonight the aurora spills green and violet like pages, and I set out more stones than ever before. [575]
I spell her name in base twelve along the prime spiral, not as a charm, but as coordinates. [593]
The eels gather in a braid, their skins singing when the dust touches them. [607]
I feel the road rise, thin and exact, and I follow it to the edge where water tries to erase land. [628]
She is there as in the futures, not aging, not young, a presence written in salt and patience. [646]
We hold the bowl together, and the dust thrums like a pulse, and the rocks shine their fragile logic. [665]
I say the promise one last time, and the air listens, and the cliff grips its own seams. [683]
The dust deepens from shine to weight, as if memory itself agrees to stop sliding. [698]
I do not know if the world will keep it, but for the length of the borrowed dawn, the path holds. [719]
The eels return to their beds, the houses settle, and our feet find traction in the thought we made. [738]
I let go of the bowl, and it does not flee, and neither do I. [753]
The villagers will come with questions, but the answer is only the pattern, a promise rehearsed until the world believes it. [774]
I am still an eel herder, still elusive, but not from hiding; I am hidden by the math we asked the sea to speak. [798]</story>
