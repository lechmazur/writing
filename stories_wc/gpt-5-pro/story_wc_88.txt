<story>After the procedure, I went to the underground bioluminescent lake that glows like stubborn constellations. [15]
I was a clean slate seeker with a dirty past, and the water already knew it. [31]
My mission, stripped to its wire core, was to kindle empathy where none remains. [45]
I carried a baseball signed by a time traveler, the ink thin as the lake's blue veins. [62]
I had found this place by reading between newspaper lines, a method he swore would survive me. [79]
Their columns spoke in negative space, forecasts inverted into coordinates, cynicism yielding breadcrumbs with a weary wink. [96]
The cave system was a labyrinth of choices, each tunnel promising salvation and repeating my worst mistakes. [113]
The water was delicately robust, a humming matrix of light algae and stone-bred patience. [127]
It answered to touch with halos that recalled fingerprints I had tried to wash off my life. [144]
They say empathy pooled here before the wars, when people still cried at strangers' funerals. [159]
I had paid for the erase-and-suture, hoping a reset would unknot me without unmaking what hurt mattered. [176]
And yet, after the procedure, memory slept like a guard on break, and conscience stayed wired awake. [193]
The baseball, scuffed from other games in other years, spun when I asked directions and settled. [209]
In its signature's loops lived a map, a way the time traveler claimed he had stolen from tomorrow. [227]
Do not trust headlines, he wrote, but the gaps; do not trust me, but my mistakes. [243]
So I took a cracked boat and began the journey across the glassy black, trying not to count ghosts. [262]
The oars feathered rings of light, margins around sentences I could almost read if I kept moving. [279]
I had run messages no one should carry, sold smiles I did not mean, broken a brother's last nerve. [298]
Starting over felt like theft too, but I had nothing else left to stain. [312]
At midlake, the ceiling opened to a dome where the light gathered like a public hearing. [328]
A woman waited there in a skiff, hollow-eyed and steady, the lake's veteran, a sentinel of hush. [345]
Payment, she said, is not coin but confession, and the lake keeps receipts longer than courts do. [362]
I held up the baseball signed by a time traveler, and her mouth fought a smile and lost. [380]
He owes me a raincheck, she said, and you owe yourself something you cannot name yet. [396]
I told her I had come to kindle empathy where none remains, starting with the spark in me. [414]
She tapped the water, and the algae replied with a humming chorus that heated my ribs. [430]
They flourish under pressure, she said, delicately robust, balanced on turbulence, like feelings outliving facts. [445]
To take any of it, you must leave a story behind, not polished, not forgiven, just true. [462]
So I told her about the fire I set for money, and who slept above the store. [479]
The water bruised bright, edits of light marking every clause I wanted to retract and could not. [496]
She nodded, then cupped the glow into a vial that pulsed like a nervous bird. [511]
Release this in the city's fountains, she said, above the market where people refuse each other's eyes. [528]
Use the ball to find your exits; its seams match eddies, and its spin forgets only when you lie. [547]
Did he ever come back, I asked, the man who signed futures like autographs and missed his throws. [565]
He found the end of his labyrinth of choices, she said, which was only the beginning of ours. [583]
I pushed off, jaded wonder climbing my throat like smoke that forgot whether to warn or warm. [600]
The currents tested me, petty tyrants in narrow throats, and the ball settled toward passages of less regret. [618]
In one tunnel I thought of my brother, how he stared past me, patient as a locked door. [636]
The lake whispered a headline I had once planted, and behind its letters marched all the faces affected. [654]
I kept steering by reading between newspaper lines formed by ripples, letting silence fill the obvious parts. [671]
When the shore rose, it did not cheer; it shrugged, citylike, asked my purpose, then waited to be persuaded. [690]
I walked the market, listening to the bartering of appetites, and found the fountain coughing change. [706]
I opened the vial, held the baseball like a reliquary, and poured the lake's choir into the spray. [724]
People blinked, hands twitching toward strangers' coats, a startle of recognition like birds deciding to migrate together. [741]
I felt my ribs open a little and shut, a door practicing its hinges, not yet letting anyone in. [760]
It was not absolution, only the start of a long repair, but the journey had chosen me back. [778]
A child kicked the water, laughing, and the ripples drew another map, delicately robust, toward better choices. [795]</story>
