<story>I am the doomsday clock adjuster, and the hidden lighthouse at dusk is my office and my chapel. [18]
I work in bruised awe of the mechanism that hums beneath the waves. [31]
Every evening the sea takes its breath, and I check the panels, the pendulum, the lens. [47]
There is a pane of hush set into the western window, a square of glass that swallows sound. [65]
On the desk beside my tools rests a broken puppet head, its paint flaking like old snow. [82]
I found it years ago in a flooded theater, and it has watched me as faithfully as any assistant. [101]
Its jaw is loose, its gaze beautifully flawed, and I use its hollow to hold the tiny key. [119]
The key turns the switch that tells the world we are not done, and it must be turned through nested patterns. [140]
Patterns of tides, patterns of light, patterns in the scars that wind has written on the stones. [157]
I learned them to serve the one ambition that keeps me here: to whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes. [177]
A lullaby soft enough to drift like mist, yet strong enough to carry across the hush of time's final ripple. [197]
The lighthouse was hidden by decree long before my watch, not to keep people out, but to keep endings patient. [217]
When dusk comes, the lens blooms with quiet fire, and the clock in the base begins to speak. [235]
It speaks in ticks and long-held silences that I measure with my breath and the puppet's cracked smile. [253]
Tonight I press my ear to the pane of hush, and the world goes still without accusing me. [271]
There is an ache in that stillness, a bruised awe that has the shape of a bell and the taste of salt. [293]
Grant me, I ask the dark, vouchsafe me one more interval to adjust the hands and teach them kindness. [312]
No answer, only the sea combing its own memory along the reef. [324]
I lift the broken puppet head and balance it on the brass finial as if to let it watch. [343]
It belonged to a girl who smiled through a curtain of rain while I explained the clock to her father. [363]
She pressed the puppet into my hands and said, keep him safe, he forgets to breathe without an audience. [382]
He has been my audience, then, for every rehearsal of the end. [394]
He lets me practice laying the world down gently, his wooden mouth open as though to sing. [411]
The lens above us is made of nested rings that drink the dusk and send it back as spiraling order. [431]
When the storm glass darkens, I begin the sequence, fingers following memory through nested patterns of switch, lever, tick, and breath. [452]
Each pattern is a gate, and each gate opens not with force but with listening. [467]
I listen to the bricks, to the rust, to the burn of old oil, to the hush beyond the pane. [487]
Somewhere inland, cities blanch under sirens, but here the only alarm is a gull who forgot its name. [505]
I take a breath and slide the key from the puppet's head and seat it in the heart of the clock. [526]
Turn once, and a century unknots its fist; turn twice, and you taste the copper of regret in the air. [546]
I do not crave dominion; I crave mercy, and mercy here means a slower fall, a hand beneath the chin of fate. [568]
So I vouchsafe the world a small reprieve, wrapped in cadence, because lullabies are time made gentle. [585]
I hum the tune the girl used to coax her puppet into life, and the rings of the lens answer. [605]
Light unfurls in ribbons, not striking outward like a blade, but moving inward, a warm tide washing the mechanism clean. [625]
That is how the sea taught me to make endings bearable, not by erasing them, but by breathing around them. [645]
The clock slows, and in the widened seconds I scatter the lullaby like seeds, to be found by sleepers yet unborn. [666]
They will not know my name, only that somewhere a hidden lighthouse at dusk kept them company in their earliest dark. [687]
The puppet watches, jaw askew, beautifully flawed and perfectly still, as if the act of watching could hold the world together. [708]
I touch its forehead, and for a moment I feel the pressure of many small hands that once clapped for it. [729]
Their applause returns as surf, their breath returns as wind, and all of it turns the gears like kind weather. [749]
When the sequence ends, I lower the key and lean my forehead to the pane of hush until it cools me. [770]
Outside, dusk yields to starlight, shy at first, then confident, and the beacon turns not to warn but to welcome. [790]</story>
