<story>The orchards glowed like lanterns under the floating rock arches as I checked my harness and breathed the whirling silence. [20]
I am an intrepid orchard pilot on an orchard planet riddled with floating rock arches, and tonight the sky will turn inside out. [43]
Every week there comes an hour when gravity inverts for an hour, and we climb toward our roots instead of away. [64]
I launch when the first pears loosen, because I have a promise to keep to find the source of resilience. [84]
My mother left me nothing but a rusted belt clasp and a broken arrow tip wrapped in seedcloth, both pointing nowhere but forward. [107]
On this planet, forward is a river that sometimes spills up, so I learned navigating by water flow. [125]
When the orchards inhale and fruit lifts like bells, the creeks run skyward past the arches, and the arches sing. [145]
We call that singing a gathering of echoes, because every noise we ever made here returns to us in braided hush. [166]
It is how we listen for memory, and how we chart safe lanes through the drifting harvest. [183]
But this season the singing changed, louder yet thinner, as if the planet were trying to speak while biting its tongue. [204]
Resilience used to mean the trees bowed and sprang back; now they bow and tremble, and some do not spring back at all. [227]
I tuck the broken arrow tip into my glove and wait by the irrigation spill where the first upward current will catch. [249]
The tip is chipped on one side, but it warms when the arches hum, a small stubborn ember. [267]
Some say it belonged to the first planters who fell upward into legend; others say it points at regret. [286]
I think it is a key pressed into me by quiet hands, and that it will open when I discover which lock it remembers. [310]
The hour arrives as a soft shudder, then a gentle roar, then the whirling silence that makes our chests feel hollow as gourds. [333]
Bolts ease from the ground, pears lift sighing, and my glider skates upward along the spray like a moth waking. [353]
I lean into the river that runs to sky, navigating by water flow as the orchards tilt and the arches open their throats. [376]
Every echo darts from arch to arch, stitching little ladders of sound that my wings can feel, like knotted ropes of air. [398]
The broken arrow tip heats until I drop it into my pocket, and it clicks against the clasp like flint begging for spark. [421]
I aim for the tallest arch, where the river becomes a column and then a veil, and something glows beyond it. [442]
Inside the veil hangs a hollow grown from roots braided into a sphere, a cradled chamber of sap and light. [462]
Sound pools there, not as noise but as pressure, and the pressure turns to pulse, and the pulse to seeds. [482]
I understand then that a gathering of echoes does more than remember; it accelerates plant growth by kneading time around young cells. [504]
But the singing is thin because something has bitten the arch, scarred it, and the chamber stutters like a heart with air. [526]
I tether my glider to a root and shoulder through the veil, feeling drips crawl upward along my arms like silver insects. [548]
Where the root braid splits, a shard of black glass drinks the light, and every echo bleeds around it into silence. [569]
I open my pocket and the broken arrow tip leaps as if pulled, eager as a seed for rain, bright as stubborn noon. [592]
It was not a weapon after all; it was a plug shaped by ancestors who trusted echoes to finish sentences the mouth could not. [616]
My hands shake in the whirling silence as I fit tip to wound, and a cold hum passes through the roots into my teeth. [640]
The shard slides home; the chamber tightens; the river lurches; and every echo, patient and bruised, returns its voice to the braid. [662]
Behind me, the pears blossom back into fruit, then into flowers again, then settle into fruit once more, green and sure. [683]
The arches sing full, and I feel resilience as not just a spring, but a hinge that knows how to slow falling. [705]
I take one seed that formed while I worked, a small pale comma, and tuck it near my heart. [724]
The gathered echoes welcome me back to the spray, carrying a map of pulses I did not know I needed. [744]
I guide the glider down the reaching river as gravity remembers itself, and the ground rises gently to meet me. [764]
The orchards exhale, and the seedlings whisper at my feet as if to say we can keep going now. [783]</story>
