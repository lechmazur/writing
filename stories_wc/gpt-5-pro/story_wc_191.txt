<story>The waterfall looked like a column of falling windows, each pane reshuffling colors from a century that had not fully happened. [21]
Behind it, the hidden orchard breathed with cool mist and old radio songs, and I knew the path remembered me. [41]
I am Maris, lore keeper of the Transit Archives, a role for people who are wisely adventurous and stubborn about memory. [62]
Tonight my assignment was personal, and the ledger called it an indulgence, but the truth was an emergency. [80]
We had until sunrise to find the stairway of ascension, or the unclaimed throne would fall to algorithms that mistook obedience for wisdom. [103]
The orchard belonged to my grandmother once, and each tree still carried a notch where she hung cassettes like prayer flags. [124]
She swore the throne would remain unclaimed until I learned to listen to the present with antique ears. [142]
So I left the Archives after last bell, gathered my toolkit and a small box holding the ruby flake, and made my sally. [165]
The flake was not a jewel exactly, but a shard of heat-fused sand from the first station where the kings boarded tides. [187]
It warmed when I faced the correct layer of history, and cooled when I pretended I knew what I was doing. [208]
A maintainer drone hovered nearby, its lenses folding like origami, broadcasting a lullaby from before the city learned to monitor dreams. [229]
I nodded to it, and it nodded back, bound by old protocols that recognized a lore keeper when one stepped into fog. [251]
To reach the orchard, I walked through the kaleidoscopic waterfall, letting blended moons and neon petals break against my shoulders. [271]
Colors tasted like childhood circuitry, and the spray ticked my skin with tiny static stars, reminding me that time could be tuned. [293]
Past the veil, the orchard opened in rows of luminous bark, each trunk overpainted a dozen times by defiant hands. [313]
Our method was old and merciful: through the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals, we would read the direction of ascent. [335]
I set the ruby flake into a hand-cranked scanner, listened to the soft planetary purr, and began shaving color in paper curls. [357]
As layers fell, murals appeared like recovered constellations, showing kings climbing staircases that were also antennae, mouths open to sing weather. [378]
Between the stair-antennae, figures in overalls held watering cans shaped like helmets, tending saplings that shimmered with broadcast fruit. [397]
It was the future as my grandmother might have wanted, tender and loud, and my chest hurt with the nostalgia of a frontier. [420]
The drone drifted closer, projecting the time limit across a leaf: an amber countdown blinking, until sunrise, until sunrise, until. [440]
I told it to hush and keep watch, because sometimes guardians need excuses for bravery, and sometimes bravery is just tending. [461]
On the fifth trunk, under a coat of municipal gray, a mural showed a woman with my grandmother's hair balancing a crown on a step. [486]
The step glowed with the same red as the flake, a frequency you can almost taste in your teeth. [505]
The ruby warmed, and the scanner translated warmth into coordinates, a thin arrow of heat pointing beyond the rows to the oldest trunk. [528]
I pressed my ear to its bark, and the orchard spoke in clipped syllables, as if spliced tape were finally allowed to stutter. [551]
Go, it said, sally to the root-room, bring the flake, and trust the mural that is still remembering you. [570]
Roots parted like curtains, revealing a crawlspace scented with ozone and apples, and my knees learned again how to bow. [590]
In the root-room, light pulsed along sap veins, spelling coordinates that matched the scanner's arrow, and a small platform waited. [610]
I set the ruby flake into a shallow cup, and the platform rose, stair by stair, through the trunk and memory's floors. [632]
When it breached the bark, I was eye-level with a floating aperture, a door drawn by a child who had studied satellites. [654]
Beyond the aperture, the stairway of ascension climbed into the waterfall's throat, each step woven from perished broadcast, advertisements softened into fog. [676]
On the highest visible step, no one stood, and that absence pulsed like a beacon: the unclaimed throne waited. [695]
I am no monarch, but I am a keeper of routes, and thrones require routes as much as crowns require pressure. [716]
I climbed, the drone circling like a quiet moon, and the murals kept rearranging under the paint, showing every ancestor who had hesitated here. [740]
They whispered that claiming could mean stewardship, that the throne might be a responsibility spread across a chorus like seeds. [760]
At the mouth of the throat, the platform widened into a disc, and the throne revealed itself as a radio made of rain. [783]
I placed my palm, and dawn answered; stewardship began where the unclaimed throne listened. [797]</story>
