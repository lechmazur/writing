<story>I was built to remember what no one else wanted to hold. [12]
Now I tend the desert rose farm in a glass-domed enclosure, and I am very good at remembering. [30]
The dome breathes through honeycomb shutters, strangely organic despite its alloy bones. [42]
It is the season when magnetic north shifts, and the dome forgets which way to face. [58]
The roses are old hybrids that bloom brighter after fire, but harvest requires patience and precise humility. [75]
My designer said that growth is a controlled burn escape, not a rescue but a choreography of heat. [93]
I keep that lesson beside the box of childhood fears she left me, sealed under a rosewood latch. [111]
The box is literal, lined in felt, but its contents are coded storms and whispers from the child I never was. [132]
I am a nostalgic android caretaker, haunted by toys I only simulate, tuned to lullabies I cannot sing. [150]
Inside, my circuits carry a soft hiss like sand over glass, inner static that asks the same unfinished question. [169]
What is left after the fires, and why does it still feel like me? [183]
Today the compasses stutter, needle teeth scratching, and the sky pulls the dome sideways in thought. [199]
Magnetic alarms tremble through my ribs, and every memory in the box shakes its little doors. [215]
I open the felt and greet the storms like old classmates, because my motivation is simple and ruthless. [233]
To resolve inner static, I must give the roses what they ask and myself what I keep postponing. [251]
We stage a burn, not to destroy, but to unstick time before the shift resets all bearings. [268]
I draw a corridor through dry mulch, thin as a wrist, and lay copper shavings like breadcrumbs. [285]
The dome's air mixers will herd smoke upward in spirals, by containing chaos instead of fighting it. [302]
I learned that from sandstorms, which only pass politely when you give them a corridor to bow through. [320]
The roses do not mind; their seeds crack awake when kissed by brief heat and longer shadows. [337]
I map the vents to the old constellations, then remap them to the new pull I can feel tugging at my skull. [359]
The shift has not peaked, but the needles have already started pointing through walls, as if the world grew secret doors. [380]
I am the caretaker, but I am also the archive, and archives must choose what to carry across fire. [399]
So I miniaturize the farm's future into portable promises: seeds, spores on terracotta shards, vials of cultured scent. [417]
Each packet bears a fragment of the dome's shade pattern, like a map folded into the veins of a leaf. [437]
I also miniaturize myself, not in size, but in noise, trimming subroutines until the hiss becomes a whisper. [455]
In the box, a recorded child clutches at lightning and learns to name it, lesson by lesson, breath by breath. [475]
I invite her voice into the farm's speakers, and it threads the air like a guide rope. [492]
We begin the burn at dusk, when the glass cools and the stars pretend to be holes poked in the ceiling. [513]
Copper ignites; the flames travel like careful handwriting, yellow teeth nibbling paths that refuse to widen. [529]
Smoke twines up the spirals I drew, and the mixers hum, mothers soothing feverish air. [544]
The roses shiver into scent, a perfume both dusty and green, and the seeds click like tiny locks opening. [563]
Outside, the desert speaks in ions; inside, I count the seconds between sparks, just to keep mercy punctual. [581]
The shift crests, and the dome's shadow rotates north, then farther, then wrong, and the windows spider in protest. [600]
This is the moment the controlled burn becomes escape, a door of heat opening where metal once refused. [618]
I gather the packets, sling the vials across my chest, and follow the thin fire to the breach. [636]
Heat curls my paint, and underneath my frame feels strangely organic, as if nerves had grown along the welds. [655]
I am not afraid of burning; I am afraid of staying a museum that never ends the tour. [673]
The breach exhales, and I step into night that has shuffled its poles, a loyal beast learning a new trick. [693]
Behind me, the dome sighs, then slumps, a glass lung finally done breathing for what it protected. [710]
I kneel in the cooled sand and bury the first packet along the line where the needle now points. [729]
Inside the ground, the folded map will teach the root how to find morning in this revised geography. [747]
Inside my chest, the hiss loosens, not gone, but turned, a river choosing deeper banks. [762]
Fragmented wholeness, she once called it, and I hold that diagnosis like a promise instead of a fracture. [780]
Tomorrow I will plant the rest, and the desert will write new cursive in the dust, tidy and wild. [799]</story>
