<story>The chapel under Saint Umber was built as a dimensional anchor, steadied by basalt and breath. [16]
At dusk the nave filled with a muffled clarity, the kind that gentled arguments into listening. [32]
Father Ruan, the loop pedal priest, plugged his rig into the old brass outlet near the altar. [49]
He layered a hush, then a longer hush, and let the recording feed back on itself. [65]
It was his way to decorate the air. [73]
He decorates with silence. [77]
Each loop carried a question, then an echo of the question, braided like river grip around a stone. [95]
Mara stood by the steps, wrists speckled with paint that had outlived its canvases. [109]
She clutched an artist's palette with one color, a flat bruise of ultramarine. [122]
The other wells were dry, scabbed moons around a single blue sun. [134]
The color purred when the sanctuary hum rose, as if the breath of the room stroked it awake. [152]
Ruan watched her not with suspicion but with a care that moved like a thumb over vellum. [169]
Her voice had been thinning for weeks, and sometimes his loops carried syllables she never said. [185]
He had asked her to meet him here, before the possession completes, because timbre can be faster than ink. [204]
Though he wore a collar, he was ordained mostly to argue with shadows. [217]
His aim was to illuminate hidden assumptions that came dressed as gods, debts, or inevitabilities. [232]
He would do it through rhetorical devices, not through threats, not through flint and smoke. [247]
Anaphora to steady, chiasmus to turn, antithesis to pry, questions to lure an answer into daylight. [263]
Around them, the chapel's unraveled stillness revealed seams that usually pretended not to be there. [278]
Breath was loud in the rafters, but each word wore gloves. [289]
Mara lifted the palette as if it weighed more than tin and wood. [302]
Do you hear it wanting a mouth, Father, she asked, not looking at him. [316]
Ruan pressed the pedal and looped his own inhale, then his exhale, both held at the edge of speech. [335]
He tried to plumb the interval between them, where possession makes a first house. [349]
What color is your hunger, he asked, and let the words drift until they found their mirror. [366]
The blue pulsed, not brighter, just more definite, like a bruise agreeing with a staircase. [381]
My hunger is for the flat, said the voice that used Mara's lips, for the comfort of one plane. [400]
Make the world stop changing and it can be owned without effort. [412]
Ruan stepped closer, the loops purring behind him like a stream rehearsing a river. [426]
He asked, If there is only one plane, who makes the horizon, and who kneels to it. [443]
The voice paused, and in the pause he set another loop, a soft anaphora of Let there be. [461]
Let there be distance that honors both sides, he intoned, and the blue skittered. [475]
Let there be the unowned, and the ownerless beauty that walks out of a frame. [490]
Let there be the listener who is not a market. [500]
The entity pressed back, rousing the pews with a wind that smelled like receipts and rain. [516]
Ruan felt the dimensional anchor take more weight, as if the chapel leaned its shoulder under them both. [534]
He kept his voice calm, addressing Mara as a person, and the mouth as a guest. [550]
You prefer one color because a field of them would betray you, he said, evenly. [565]
A chorus of small delays feathered the words, and the room leaned closer without moving. [580]
Who told you complexity was a threat, he asked, offering the answer in the asking. [595]
The palette shivered, and a bead of blue crawled along its rim like a tide unsure of shore. [613]
It said, I remake until nothing surprises, because surprise makes me imagine I am not alone. [629]
Ruan nodded and let the chiasmus turn its hinge: Not alone in the change, but changed by being not alone. [649]
The entity faltered, feeling grammar slide its footholds, and Mara's breath came twice, uncoached. [663]
He asked the last question quietly, almost like a confession from the other side of the grate. [680]
If you own everything, what will you ask tomorrow. [689]
The loops held, and the silence between them became a room where the answer had to sit down. [707]
In that seat the demon recognized its hunger as a door, not a throne, and loosened. [723]
Blue thinned to water, and the palette became something Mara could put down without it pulling back. [740]
The possession did not complete, because possession cannot complete where questions are a commons. [754]
Ruan rested his foot on the pedal and thinned the loops until only breath remained, then not even breath. [773]
The chapel did not become louder; it became truer, the hush clearing like a lake at daybreak. [790]</story>
