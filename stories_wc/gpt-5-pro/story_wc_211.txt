<story>After the foghorn falls silent, I climb to the ancient orchard garden atop a skyscraper with my satchel of brittle tools. [21]
I am a venerable oath scribe, sworn to harvest vows the way others pick fruit, careful, seasonal, and bruised by memory. [42]
Tonight the branches crowd like old jurors over my head, and the city glows below like a smothered ember. [61]
I came to archive emotional patterns, not petty data but the textures that hearts leave when stitched to oaths and kept. [82]
The trees are grafted from pilgrim stock, their bark crosshatched with pledges I etched decades ago in scripts most have forgotten. [103]
I, whom the guild says speaks dead languages, sometimes hear the dead speak back through the bruised fruit and the wind that combs these alleys of leaves. [130]
That is why the guild trusts me with the wax cylinder phonograph shaving curled in black ribbon inside a wooden case. [151]
It is the skin shed from a cylinder etched with decades of oath voices, shaved clean to reuse, yet the spiral keeps a ghost. [175]
When I unspool it between my fingers, a velvet disquiet presses over the garden, as if the air puts on mourning gloves. [197]
The shaving remembers, and memory has teeth like moths; it eats holes that spell unlikely constellations of sound. [215]
I light the lamp the color of syrup, then immerse the curled strip in warmed rainwater to loosen the city soot and skin. [238]
The apple roots hum faint consonants while I thread the strip along a glass rim, coaxing the faint grooves to speak. [259]
I learned this trick via a curious third-grade field trip memory, when a docent sliced wax curls and made us listen with paper cups. [283]
She said sound has a rind, and if you save the rind, the orchard of voices will grow in your pocket. [304]
The city fog rests below like a down comforter now, and I balance the shaving so the grooves skim the rim as I breathe. [328]
What pours out is not a sentence, not a voice, but a texture like pebbles poured from a glove, pocked with salt and grief. [352]
I take notes in willow ink, tracing the rises like heartbeats, convinced their sequence will archive the patterns of remorse, hope, and stubbornness. [375]
But the orchard leans closer, and the grooves knit themselves into a phrase that does not know it is a phrase. [396]
An accidental prophecy rubs against my ear, the way a cat rubs against a book and makes it smell like a promise. [418]
It says a vow will split at dusk, not from betrayal but from careful keeping, and that my name will be the knife. [441]
I close my eyes to steady the garden, but the wind moves like courtroom hands, asking me to swear to what I hear. [464]
I was trained to bind oaths to living wood, to pin human storms to patient rings, and to never be part of the weather. [488]
Yet I know my handwriting within the grooves; my cadence haunts them the way the taste of a coin haunts a tongue. [510]
Years ago I recorded a famine oath here, pledging to ration testimony, to prune desire, to spare the roots from gossiping about bread. [533]
I shaved that cylinder to make room, and in the shavings I now unspool, the pruning has knotted itself into a blade with my signature. [558]
The prophecy is not magic, it is a remainder, the arithmetic of grooves where subtracting leaves the shape of what was held. [580]
To test it, I press the shaving to the bark of the oldest pear, and the bark whispers in Hittite, which no one here should know. [606]
I answer in that tongue because I speak dead languages, and the tree replies, Yes, you are the knife, and also the sheath. [629]
There is a choice: bind the coming split and lose the echo that taught us mercy, or let it open and keep the map of feeling intact. [656]
I set the shaving to dry on the lamp, making a small arch of night between us, and consider what an oath is for. [680]
An oath is supposed to bind, but my work was always to keep the binding legible, so future hearts could read the pressure marks. [704]
So I breathe, touch ink to bark, and instead of sealing the split I write the prophecy beside it, that the archive of our emotional patterns survive exposure, and I attach my name as witness rather than as knife. [743]</story>
