<story>The night carries a quivering hush over the luminous harbor by moonlight. [12]
As a fire escape gardener, I watch each ripple hold its breath. [24]
The old rosebush beside my window trembles as if it remembers storms. [36]
After the final petal drops from the old rosebush, I will begin. [48]
It loosens, sighs, and falls like a small boat released from its tether. [61]
That hush gathers against my ribs like fog that has learned to listen. [74]
I am wistfully pragmatic, which means I hope while my hands keep moving. [87]
Tonight the hope is a plan built from scraps and a lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth. [102]
My father kept it on a chain when he tended the canal lock. [115]
He said every gate deserves a patient measure before you push. [126]
Out there, he rowed from cradle to cradle with the rhythm of oars in water. [141]
He called that rhythm a promise you keep with your shoulders. [152]
I carry his tooth now because it fits the hinge of my idea. [165]
By day the stairwell inside our building swallows people in stale gloom. [177]
Children whisper there as if shadows might learn their names. [187]
Mrs Gallo refuses the elevator because it rattles her memory. [197]
I want to reflect light into dark corners until they flinch and soften. [210]
Moonlight will be my gentle fire, coaxed from the harbor and steered home. [223]
I have glued shards into a mesh that drapes like a silver net. [236]
Hung just right, it can carry light down through a broken transom. [248]
But the roof door sticks behind a padlock we lost the key to. [261]
That is why the tooth waits warm against my sternum. [271]
I step from the fire escape with the balance he taught me. [283]
Each motion follows the rhythm of oars in water so the metal stays calm. [297]
In the hush the padlock yields to the patient angle of the gauge. [310]
I do not pick it so much as remind it of opening. [322]
Above me the harbor spills light like milk into every moored mouth. [334]
The roof receives me with tar that keeps yesterday's sun. [344]
I lift the net of mirrors, their edges taped and angled by memory. [357]
The mesh rattles a little, a quivering hush made of glass breath. [369]
I anchor one corner with twine and the other with the gauge tooth. [382]
Its ridges bite into tar like a small promise holding its place. [394]
When the net hangs true, the stairwell inhales then sighs out a pale river. [408]
Light finds the mouth, slides down, and settles where fear once nested. [420]
On the landing below, little Theo steps into the spill with his toy boat. [434]
His mother whispered that he would not walk past noon without a hand. [447]
Tonight he lets go, shoulder searching the light as if it were rope. [460]
Mrs Gallo looks up from her door and crosses herself, then begins to hum. [474]
I feel my heart move with the rhythm of oars in water, steady and near. [489]
It is not brightness, exactly, but a gentling which dark cannot refuse. [501]
I think of my father above the lock, reading gauges with patient hands. [514]
He wanted to instill steadiness in waters that forgot their own pace. [526]
I want to instill something like that in people who call this building home. [540]
The mirrors do not shout, which fits my protected vulnerability. [550]
I have learned to guard my hope so it can stay. [561]
Yet I leave some of it where people will trip gently over it. [574]
In the courtyard, a cat tilts its head and studies the new stream. [587]
On his step, Mr Alvarez chuckles because his plants look newly awake. [599]
He calls up, asks which saint I bribed to tilt the moon. [611]
No saints, I say, just angles and a tooth with an honest bite. [624]
He laughs again, and the sound polishes the bannister against my palm. [636]
Theo sails his boat along the stripe of light toward the trash room. [649]
He pauses, then pushes open the door that always smelled like the hull. [662]
Inside, his mother finds the mop and laughs at her own shaking. [674]
When they return, I am still on the roof, guiding the mesh. [686]
I nudge it a fraction, instill patience in the flutter, and wait. [698]
More light draws across the stair like a seam mended by careful hands. [711]
The harbor answers, small waves clinking, a far buoy counting its breaths. [723]
I whisper thanks to the water for lending its discipline to the sky. [736]
The tooth will rust someday, but tonight it is bright as a star. [749]
When I finally climb down, the stairwell smells faintly of roses and salt. [762]
The old rosebush waits empty, but the bush is not done speaking. [774]
Its thorns shine, catching a seam of night like stitches that hold. [786]
I touch the stem, and the hush inside me becomes a harbor. [798]</story>
