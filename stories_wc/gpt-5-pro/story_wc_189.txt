<story>We sat in an ancient grotto under stars, letting our words fade against the drip and hush. [17]
Across the pause in a difficult conversation, I studied the pools as if reading braille in water. [34]
I am a tidal-pool chronicler, a warmly observant sorter of gleams, slow grazers, and respiring sand. [50]
You had asked whether I would stay, or finally leave the coast that schooled us in patience. [67]
Your voice trembled, mine clung to shells, and the silence spilled like low tide around our knees. [84]
Between us lay a small wrapped bundle, the jade cicada we had found lodged in a rock throat. [102]
It felt cool and waking, a fossil of change pressed from someone else's seasons. [116]
I turned it in my palm and let the pools write their stories on its green glaze. [133]
To be here with you was to risk the shore breaking, yet we had come to discover the texture of time. [154]
Because the old lagoon kept its own counsel, I listened sideways, to light skimming barnacles and to our breath. [173]
I had learned to foresee only through tangential approach, never by staring straight into a question's blaze. [190]
So I watched a snail bridge the slick of a star, and felt the night inch its own grammar. [209]
The jade cicada seemed to hum against my skin, a pocket shrine for transition periods and soft armor. [227]
You had been my teacher in the tide flats, insisting that the crossings between states were holy work. [245]
Between flood and ebb, between larva and flight, between leaving and staying, our measures thinned and grew lucid. [263]
Now your breath hitched, and I knew you feared my answer would spring like a trap from the dark. [282]
I felt a current tug me sideways, and I offered instead a catalog of tonight's small, speaking thresholds. [300]
There, a crab molting in patience, there, a ribbon of tide leaving sentences of foam, there, a trust unspooling. [319]
Your shoulders eased, not from persuasion, but because the grotto answered us with an older yes. [335]
The cave roof framed constellations we thought we knew, and the tidal clock kept a promise we never made. [354]
I remembered the year you taught me to leave nets slack so fish could choose their hour of freedom. [373]
You said that patience was not waiting but allowing a shore to arrive. [386]
The words were a door I carried for years without noticing how my hand kept the hinge warm. [404]
Tonight I opened it by telling you about the snail, which is to say I stepped aside for truth. [423]
A difficult conversation cannot be forced to bloom; it unfurls when it senses that it can hide. [440]
I said, I do not know if I will stay, but I know how the mussels hold and release. [459]
I said, I can feel the hinge of it, as if my chest were a shell finding slack. [477]
You nodded, and the cicada gleamed, its jade body a promise that leaving is a form of arrival. [495]
Buried with the dead in ancient fields, such insects were tokens to help the tongue wake for a second song. [515]
Here, the jade cicada asked us to shed a casing we had mistaken for skin. [530]
I thought of all my notebooks listing tide heights, moon phases, and small embarrassments I had filed as data. [549]
Was that chronicling, or was it a fear of being caught by waves without a ledger to hold me steady? [569]
You touched the pool and said nothing, and the silence felt useful, like salt on a cut. [586]
The grotto breathed, and I could suddenly foresee a way to answer that would honor both shorelines. [603]
I told you about the first time I learned that every creature holds two clocks, one of water and one of will. [625]
The tide can wait on the moon, but the will waits on a question spoken without the demand to end it. [646]
I said, I do not choose tonight, but I agree to cross this mouth of water with you until the footing names itself. [669]
You laughed, soundless, and the difficult part of the conversation dissolved, not by victory, but by courtesy to change. [688]
We tucked the cicada back into its cloth, and the stars brightened as the tide began to turn. [706]
In that turning I felt the texture of time rough and smooth at once, like a scallop's edge. [724]
It was not a line to be measured, but a body to be met by touch, drift, and honest slowness. [744]
We rose, and I pressed my palm flat to the grotto wall, feeling countless migrations patiently stored in the stone. [764]
As we walked out, the tide offered our ankles a cool vow, and the cicada slept, content to wait. [783]
The pause ended, its salt on our tongues, a map we would follow slowly together. [798]</story>
