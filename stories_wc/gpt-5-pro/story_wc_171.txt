I step onto the ancient terrace at midsummer, the stones warm with stored sun and scored with old petitions. [19]
Above, during the slow dance of celestial bodies, the planets pace like patient jurors over our fragile table. [37]
I carry an ebony clipboard heavy as a vow, its smooth black face reflecting my furrowed brow. [54]
I am the forever war peace negotiator they send when other promises have rusted into weapons. [70]
My hands are operatively gentle, trained to adjust a distance without announcing why the distance matters. [86]
Tonight my motive is simple and heavy, to anchor ideals in practice before the stars finish their counsel. [104]
Flawed beauty holds the place, from cracked balustrades to the lichened bowls set for water and ash. [121]
I muster the delegations by the western edge where the wind keeps secrets from lingering too long. [138]
Salt banners meet ember shawls, each thread already a history, each knot a throat cleared toward confession. [155]
I take names on the clipboard and let the ink dry slow, so every letter remembers its weight. [173]
No one here is unsullied, least of all me, who shelved one truth to save another and lost both. [192]
The price of redemption is not paid in one coin, and interest gathers in shadows I still visit. [210]
An alignment waits, and every alignment has a seam; if we miss it, the seam will close like a wound. [230]
Through ritual significance we thread our intentions into the world's quieter memory, where boasting cannot reach. [246]
I set a bowl of river water between them, carried from both banks, and ask for open hands above it. [266]
The Ember Matriarch offers her wrist, charred scar tissue bright as lacquer; the Salt General unclenches a white fist. [285]
I ask them to pour a little heat and a little brine, and let steam braid the air. [303]
When the plume rises, I press the ebony clipboard to catch a sheen, so the document smells faintly of tide. [323]
Paper can listen, if you ask without pride; wood remembers, if you have earned a respectful grip. [340]
The terms begin as murmurs, then as stones, all edges and fall, and I catch them on the board. [359]
Resettlements, shared wells, mourning time, schools that teach the maps both children grew without, each note a necessary hinge. [378]
The General wants guarantees and the Matriarch wants grace, and each wants the other to ask first. [395]
I take a breath in a shared cadence we learned from prison choirs, and they follow because breath is unowned. [415]
I speak of the children who will inherit the aftertaste of tonight, and of the markets that need safe doors. [435]
I tell them the terrace will keep our failures too, so we must choose failures we can teach from. [454]
Then the General asks for the price of redemption, and his eyes mean mine, not the ledger's. [471]
He names the ambush I greenlit once to save a clinic, and the twenty-seven who never spoke again. [489]
The Matriarch nods because her aunt was among them, a singer whose silence still conducts their grief. [506]
I have rehearsed this hurt, but rehearsal is clean and tonight is bone, so I offer my breath as bond. [526]
If the accord fails by either hand, I will speak no more for any army, nor even for my own name. [547]
I set a reed across my tongue and close my teeth, a vow that can be broken only by peace kept. [568]
Through ritual significance the reed becomes a hinge: if violence returns, it will snap and I will fall silent. [587]
The General studies the river steam dried on my ebony clipboard, and he nods as if recognizing a scar. [606]
The Matriarch places her charred wrist under the reed's shadow and says she will measure her days with it. [625]
We sign, not with blood, but with breath-clouds pressed to the wood, leaving ghost ovals that overlap like small continents. [645]
I initial the margins and the board drinks it, the ebony accepting marks as if it were nighttime soil. [664]
Around us, during the slow dance of celestial bodies, a faint ring appears where two planets pretend to touch. [683]
The terrace seems to lean closer, its cracked rail a smile missing teeth, and the wind exhales like an uncle. [703]
I muster a last request: keep mourning visible, build wells together, teach your children the names for both kinds of fire. [724]
The General and the Matriarch exchange stools instead of swords, and their knees knock, which is how families begin. [743]
My voice rattles around the reed like a sparrow in a bell, but the bell refuses to ring harm. [762]
I leave the ebony clipboard on the terrace altar, so the night can press its own seal upon it. [781]
If dawn finds us human, let it be known we paid to walk lighter, and that weight remains remembered. [800]
