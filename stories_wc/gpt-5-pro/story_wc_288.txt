<story>The library rose and fell like a tide above the clouds, and I kept my balance between aisles. [18]
They called it the tidal library above clouds, where shelves creaked as if seawater breathed through their grain. [36]
I am a contemporary of extinct species, older than their graves yet orphaned by their silence. [52]
All this unfolded after the reincarnation memory, when the sky seemed discontinuous and breathing felt borrowed. [68]
I had one intention: to translate isolation into independence without cracking the fragile footage of my returning lives. [86]
My only tool was a brass sundial, polished so fine it looked atomically reflective under the cloudlight. [103]
I kept it in my palm and used it to steer the tides of the stacks. [119]
The stacks listened by the hum of an ancient stone circle embedded beneath the reading floor. [135]
When the hum rose, the shelves drifted shoreward; when it sank, passages opened between wet-lipped bookspines. [151]
Each morning was one of those brittle awakenings, where memory arrives like frost and splinters at a touch. [169]
I would watch the sundial reflect myself into facets, as if every atom kept a different year. [186]
The library kept a catalog of tones for each reader, and mine had been stamped in red: Tone: None. [205]
It seemed correct, because after so many returns the taste of emotion felt sapped by the salt of persistence. [224]
I was here to study what remained of those extinct friends whose winters I had shared as their contemporary. [243]
They survived in annotations, marginalia sewn with hair, recipes for cooling volcanoes, and a grammar of storm-sign. [260]
To reach their wing I had to calibrate the hum, and the sundial served as tuning mirror. [277]
When I angled it, the atomically reflective face sent thin light into the stones, and the circle thrummed awake. [296]
A door of wind opened, and the tide drew me along a corridor murmuring in a language like rain. [315]
I stepped into the wing and met the Librarian, whose face changed with each current, half-fish, half-scarab, fully patient. [334]
We conversed by gestures, because speech in that room turned to foam, leaving meanings to drip out slowly. [352]
The Librarian asked what I wanted, and I answered simply: to translate isolation into independence, without inventing new ghosts. [371]
I needed no chorus, only the capacity to coexist with absence and not be consumed by it. [388]
The Librarian nodded and held out a ledger bound in kelp, a record of my earliest winter beside the lost ones. [409]
I could read it only when the hum aligned, so I turned the sundial until the needle-shadow touched noon. [428]
Letters rose like fish scales, and the memory came fixed but cold, a shell without creature. [444]
There I stood, younger than my dust, a child counting deaths as games, a poor trustee of future continents. [463]
Shame tried to drown me, but Tone: None kept me afloat, the catalog refusing dramatics in favor of clarity. [482]
Clarity revealed their last supper, a circle on the ice that wasn't ritual, only stones keeping rhythm for heat. [501]
They had taught me to place the sundial at the center, capturing sun when it broke through blizzards like a knife. [522]
Together we survived that season by the hum of an ancient stone circle, the same pattern now sleeping beneath me. [542]
I understood that the library was their bequeathal, a raft of knowledge returned every tide to those who listened. [561]
To earn it, I must coexist without pretending they were still here, nor pretend I was ever truly alone. [580]
I asked the Librarian to witness a vow, tempered by brittle awakenings, that would turn isolation into a stance. [599]
The stance was not defiance but independence, a way to harvest warmth from memory without trapping anything inside glass. [618]
The Librarian drew a wet thumb across my sundial, and the brass deepened to the color of late tea. [637]
In it I saw not my reflections but theirs, a field of faces scattering, each one recalling me without demanding return. [658]
I closed the ledger and the wind-door at once, letting the circle subside, letting the shelves beach themselves in quiet. [678]
Then I walked the aisles and reshelved what I had learned, a small act of coexistence with the future. [697]
Above the clouds the tide began to rise again, but I felt no pull stronger than my chosen balance. [716]
I set the sundial on the threshold as a beacon, and the library decided to keep me until morning. [735]
There, between shelves and sky, the extinct and I could coexist without craving reunion, and so independence began. [753]</story>
