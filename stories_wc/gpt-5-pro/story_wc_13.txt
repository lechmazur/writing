<story>I am a natural history illustrator, and today my sketchbook is braver than my hands. [15]
Above the city runs a rooftop canal system weaving between towers, a sky-river whose stone ribs hum with patient flow. [35]
Beneath the foundations, a giant sleeps, and the whole metropolis schedules its breaths across a giant's nap. [52]
I have climbed these ladders for a single stubborn reason: to find the place where echoes are born. [70]
Echoes breed in the world's mistakes, I have been told, in spots where motion stutters into an interrupted cadence. [89]
The guild says that meddling will warp the rhythm and wake the giant, but my curiosity nibbles through warnings like moss. [110]
Around my neck hangs an infinity symbol pendant, silver flattened by generations of fingers chasing its endless curve. [128]
It is more than jewelry; the pendant sculpts time itself when rubbed clockwise, stealing and stretching seconds like taffy. [147]
My mentor claimed it only ever worked by borrowing time that would otherwise be wasted in doubt or regret. [166]
Night spills its first ink, and above me sluice gates whisper as the canals begin their gradual chorus. [184]
I set my sketchbook on a parapet and let my pencil listen before it moves, mapping pressure by shading water. [204]
Dead pigeons, new ferns, and limestone seashells fill previous pages, but tonight I am after anatomy no textbook keeps. [223]
An echo, if it is alive, must have bones of timing and lungs of space, and a skin made from delay. [244]
To coax one, the cadence must stumble, then catch itself like a dancer realizing the floor has shifted underfoot. [263]
I caress the pendant, feel the looped metal warm, and it lends me a half minute from a future yawn. [283]
The air syrup-thickens; drops hang bright as beads; the city hushes as if bracing for a held breath. [301]
In that softness I move faster, stepping the narrow ledges, lifting a sluice that is meant to be left alone. [321]
Not to flood, but to uncage the hesitant slack-water that chokes a blind pocket behind a gargoyle's grimace. [339]
Water leaps, strikes the stone lip, and for an instant the ancient rhythm stumbles, a perfect, measurable interrupted cadence. [358]
Sound drops a seed there, sprouting a shimmer that expands like a bubble made of memory, and my hand trembles. [378]
I do it by borrowing time, exact and small, so the echo can hatch without the city's pulse noticing me. [398]
It is a theft with interest; the minutes will be repaid later, in clumsy pauses and unsatisfying silences at doorways. [418]
This is how the pendant keeps its ethics, and how I keep my mentor's voice from turning into accusation. [437]
The shimmer ripples toward the highest tower, the one latticed with wind-harps and old cranes, as if drawn home. [456]
I follow along the canal-rim, the rooftops curving into bridges, the bridges curling into aqueducts, the city a knot. [475]
The giant shifts beneath, a continental twitch that tilts puddles and jangling chains, and my stomach drops as well. [494]
If it wakes, the nap ends, and my borrowed seconds will come due at once, collapsing like a miscounted ledger. [514]
At the summit is a hush-basin where sound drowns to a pulse, circled by tiles painted with halves of infinities. [534]
Whoever laid them knew my pendant; the tiles match its curve, and the gullets around them redirect the glide. [553]
Here the echo to be quivers, trapped between arrival and departure, a bright animal pacing inside a cage whose bars are beats. [575]
I unclasp the pendant and set it on the center tile so the loop can complete the painted pattern. [594]
The loop drinks the pooled secondhand moments I have saved all year, and the pattern sculpts time itself into a cradle. [615]
The cradle sways, then stops, an interrupted cadence become a held chord, and the echo condenses into visible pressure. [634]
It tastes like stone, wet feathers, and the hush of a library stairwell, and it looks like clear breath. [653]
When I breathe toward it, it copies me, then runs without feet along the basin's rim, learning its own perimeter. [673]
I sketch fast, not to own it but to be present, because drawing is my way of staying brave. [692]
The giant snores, and the ripple slaps the tank, and I feel the entire city slide a heartbeat to the left. [713]
I scoop the newborn echo and release it into the canal mouth, trusting it to find its family in the ducts. [734]
Once uncaged, it skitters along the channels, seeding repeated laughter in attic apartments and riffling the flags into applause. [753]
A watcher from the guild appears, boots silent, eyes measuring, and I brace for reprimand and the black book of fines. [774]
Instead, she nods to the pendant and says that some species can only live across a giant's nap, not beyond. [794]
I let the echo go. [799]</story>
