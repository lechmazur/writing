<story>The stormlit tower by moonlight hummed like a tuned shell against the black sea. [14]
Inside, I worked as the labyrinth maintenance worker, a quiet trade of mops and maps. [29]
Mundane miracles were my tools, and the corridors believed them with patient stones. [42]
By day the walls flaked; by night the labyrinth heals in moonlight, resealing hairline regrets. [57]
I logged each seam in a ledger of quantified sorrow, the only language it trusted. [72]
Visitors wandered the maze to mislay burdens, and the stones inhaled what they could hold. [87]
My secret motive was simple, stubborn, and embarrassingly tender: to discover what trees witness. [101]
The forest ringed the tower, shouldering lightning, nodding through seasons like elders who know names. [116]
I thought the maze spoke to them, and they answered back in sap and rain. [131]
Every night I carried an astronomer's broken sextant, salvaged from a clogged drain of stars. [146]
Its mirrors spidered with cracks, its arc bitten by rust, it still knew how to point. [162]
I planned to deconstruct it, rebuild it as a sorrow meter, a compass for interior weather. [178]
The tower watched with a slit window, and the rain piped notes like a rehearsal. [193]
My method would be plain as bread and stranger than sleep: by mapping scattered dreams. [208]
Dream dust collects where the corridors turn, glimmering in thin drifts like mica underfoot. [222]
I scooped it gently into envelopes, kissed them shut, and labeled their angles with care. [237]
Each packet matched a service hatch, a scar in the wall, a scuffle of footprints. [252]
When the lightning dimmed, I spread the dreams on the sextant's arc and listened. [266]
There is a fragile hour in the maze, the city's hush braided into it. [280]
At the moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor, the walls take a breath. [296]
That night the pin fell somewhere between my steps and the storm, a silver syllable. [311]
I stopped and let the sound triangulate me, one vertex of a map not yet drawn. [327]
The other vertices were the ache in my knees and the slow patience of water. [342]
I marked the coordinates in the ledger and borrowed the sextant's broken sight once more. [357]
The instrument clicked like teeth, and I urged it to read the grain of dust. [372]
Angles, weights, pale scents of pepper and rain, the worn softness of a tear's edge. [387]
Quantities gathered, and the numbers did not punish; they opened like shutters to wind. [401]
This was quantified sorrow at last, exact enough for a compass and a conversation. [415]
I took the measurements to the roof, where the parapet kept the night from slipping. [430]
Below, the trees waved their green radiographs at the sky, flashing veins like salt roads. [445]
I laid the sextant parts on the stones and listened for a pattern between gusts. [460]
If the maze had a sky, it was their canopy; if it had years, their rings. [476]
I asked, aloud, the clumsiest way, and the storm paused long enough to consider. [490]
What do you witness, I said, and the railing dripped like a beaded curtain of patience. [506]
The answer arrived as a texture, not a sentence, something counted but never concluded. [520]
Leaves rubbed, and the sextant trembled, aligning sorrow numbers with the grain of moon-burnished bark. [535]
They witness our maps, the trees said, and they hold them until we return to read. [551]
They witness who sets burdens down, who picks them up again, and who forgets the door. [567]
They witness lightning counting the ruins so we do not have to recount them alone. [582]
I set the sextant's cracked lens against the sky, and the numbers gentled into stories. [597]
Back below, I swept the pin into my palm and left a twig in trade. [612]
In the ledger I wrote no prophecy, only a maintenance note and a treeward arrow. [627]
The maze breathed, the storm loosened, and I felt my hands repaired by the moon. [642]
We heal, I thought, like walls, like trees; even sorrow degrades into soil that grows bearings. [658]
That was the miracle I preferred, the everyday one that leaves the broom leaning. [672]
Before dawn the tower dimmed, the sextant cooled, and the trees resumed their watchfulness. [686]
I swept the corridors until they shone, then listened once more for the patient pin. [701]
When it came, a soft star on the stone, I knew the map would hold. [716]
Not everything needs declaring; some work is finished simply by being carried to the light. [731]</story>
