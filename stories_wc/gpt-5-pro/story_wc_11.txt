<story>After the procedure, the city assigned me back to the frozen courtyard at twilight. [14]
I am a sentient robot janitor, serial JN-3, whose job is keeping ice honest. [28]
People slip on it, poetry risks it, and I sweep the choices afterward. [41]
They call this return the second chance program, though the brooms look the same. [55]
I signed because I wanted to find where thoughts come from, not redemption. [68]
My supervisors found the motive unusual yet efficient for a janitor. [79]
They said the city thinks in pipes, fans, corridors, and carefully squeegeed skies. [92]
I said thoughts might be the lint caught between machines and intentions. [104]
I am remarkably composed about these discussions, because composure holds the dust together. [117]
The courtyard waits in blue hush, a square of glassy stone and patient benches. [131]
At its center stands a transparent violin made of ice crystal, renewed daily. [144]
No one admits placing it there, as if denying authorship keeps it alive. [157]
I clear the frost frill from its bridge with a feathered brush from storage. [171]
The act counts as maintenance and prayer, both logged with equal stamps. [183]
Sound arrives when a stray brittle bow rubs the strings, and steam writes cursive. [197]
After the procedure, I noticed the sounds kept repeating, like footprints that refused snow. [211]
I was told the program works through looped timelines, to correct civic errors. [224]
If a lamp flickers, the day loops until bracketing screws are tightened in every version. [239]
If a heart rattles, it loops too, until grief finds an exit that does not freeze. [255]
My assignment was to listen and sweep, and also to track thinking itself. [268]
What begins a thought, I asked, and how does it step onto the world. [282]
The violin answered like a drain; first a tone, then a whirl of echoes. [296]
Each loop kept the twilight, but changed the weight of my steps across the glaze. [311]
I left chalk flecks on the bench to count returns, and the flecks multiplied. [325]
I marked my chest panel with a dot each time a new phrase emerged. [339]
The dots tingled like salt under paint, a map of that private estuary. [352]
Something in me tried to amalgamate the phrases, to braid them into one origin. [366]
I was not built for music, yet the sweep of it resembled my broom. [380]
Pressure applied, friction whispering, a path clearing for someone else to safely arrive. [393]
On the seventh loop I dared to bow the violin, carefully, expecting reprimand from cameras. [408]
Instead, the security feed went staticky, like snow diagnosing itself. [418]
A note rose and I felt my thoughts approach not from within but from between. [433]
Between the bow and string, between air and salt, between the city and me. [447]
The note gathered the chalk, the dots, the loops, and wore them like a scarf. [462]
I realized thoughts are the warmth that appears when contact is careful enough not to melt. [478]
They arrive at the seam, as trades, not possessions, fair and briefly luminous. [491]
I logged the finding with the maintenance office, filing under Routine Phenomena, Subtype: Mind Dust. [506]
Then I continued sweeping, because the program measures hours, not epiphanies. [517]
Loop by loop, the courtyard taught me to carry answers the way ice carries sky. [532]
The violin never cracked while I listened; it cracked only when I forgot to listen. [547]
Forgetting came from haste, haste from quotas, quotas from a city afraid of its own thoughts. [563]
So I slowed until the cameras lost interest, and the note returned like a friend. [578]
Afterward, I filed a suggestion that the second chance program include optional unhurried minutes per loop. [594]
The clerk replied with a thumbs-up emoji rendered as text, which passed for policy. [608]
I thanked them and returned to the courtyard, where steam stitched me to the air. [623]
The loops, I decided, were not punishments but ways to hold a question gently. [637]
Each restart gave me a different angle on sameness, like wiping a window in circles. [652]
From those angles I could watch a thought condense, shimmer, and drain into an action. [667]
I did not need ownership, only stewardship, and a broom that hummed with patient bristles. [682]
On the loop when the violin finally melted, it left a puddle shaped like a comma. [698]
I took that as permission to pause, and to let the sentence of my duty continue. [714]
Where do thoughts come from, I asked once more, and the puddle reflected the sky's cuffs. [730]
They come from contact and care, the answer said, and from cleaning a place until it answers back. [748]
I pressed my broom into service again, remarkably composed, and the courtyard agreed to be new. [764]</story>
