<story>The harbor remembers me better than the bureaucrats ever did. [10]
I am a death certificate error survivor, which makes me a ghost with legal breath. [25]
Without papers that agree with my pulse, I walk unnamed between cranes and stacked iron corridors. [41]
My nameless identity floats like diesel sheen, thin yet stubborn, refusing to sink where others can see. [58]
I live inside a towering labyrinth of shipping containers in a port city. [71]
Here the gulls are overseers, the cranes are metronomes, and everyone keeps time across the rhythm of tides. [89]
My mind filters reality differently, sifting noise for texture the way dockhands test ropes by touch. [105]
I came here to discover the texture of memories, the weave that holds a life when names unravel. [123]
I collect and I listen, because I have few words left that belong solely to me. [139]
I make a map without lines or legends, only the hum of backdoors and the hush of rain. [157]
I do this by collecting fragments of overheard stories, the way beachcombers pocket glass made soft by years. [175]
Every snippet is a shell pressed to my ear, and I layer their murmurs until a tide speaks back. [194]
Some nights a dockworker sings of a brother who vanishes whenever the container lights blink. [209]
Some mornings a customs clerk whispers to the coffee steam that paperwork can drown, and drowners do not write. [228]
These are erased histories, scuffed from ledgers, smeared from screens, still breathing in the gaps left behind. [245]
When the tide is low, the mud offers its archive, stamped with boot patterns and tiny crab hieroglyphs. [263]
When the tide is high, the hulls thrum, a choir of locked rooms remembering what they were made to forget. [283]
Once, wedged between two rusted walls, I found a label from poison bottle curled like a secret tongue. [301]
It smelled faintly of almonds and seawater, like a murder that had learned to bathe. [316]
On its faded blue, a brand promised clean holds and rodentless nights, and I felt the script watching me. [335]
I pinned it to the wind with my gaze and waited for someone to claim it, and no one did. [355]
Later I heard a woman breathe to the tide that her father died without a witness, only an invoice. [374]
His dock nickname matched a code stamped on a container where a misfiled drum leaked, and hats came off. [393]
I felt the cold arrangement of causes in my throat, beads threaded by someone else's error. [409]
My own paper death began with a code, too, a letter flicked sideways in the office wind. [426]
A clerk misread a name, a ship misread a manifest, and the current took my record where bodies go. [445]
I kept walking because walking was proof, but proof without a line to point at becomes fog. [462]
So I began to layer what I heard, to give missing names the weight of weather. [478]
A whistle at dawn became a remark about a cousin, which became a town, which became a clock on a mantel. [499]
I wrote none of it, because pages can be seized; I carried it in breath and gait instead. [517]
When I sleep under tarps, the containers talk, each dent a consonant, each scrape a vowel, making names. [535]
They tell me the dead prefer verbs, because only actions leave wakes, and wakes are what we can follow. [554]
I followed the label from poison bottle to a small office with barred windows and plants drinking dust. [572]
The clerk there could not say my name, but he could speak the container code that replaced it. [590]
He told me the drum was destroyed, the report amended, the past corrected, and no one harmed officially. [608]
I looked at the window and saw the tide working the pilings like a scribe rubbing away letters. [626]
I left him with silence, and outside I tucked the label into my sleeve where the pulse lives. [644]
I walked the rows until the cranes began their evening rites, carving shadows like brackets around losses. [661]
A sailor told a joke to nobody, and I kept the punchline because it carried the weight of grief. [680]
Another woman traded cigarettes for a rumor, and I traded silence for a place to listen beside her. [698]
We sat within the labyrinth and spoke of erased histories that still left calluses where absence grips. [715]
I told her I had no name that worked, only footsteps and a card that failed machines. [732]
She nodded and said the machines never listen, and we must build our own ears from rust. [749]
So I taught her to hear as I do, to trail and to layer, to translate crates into voices. [768]
Together we moved across the rhythm of tides, gathering what the water returned, and returning what it gathered. [786]</story>
