<story>I arrived at the orchard after the liquidation, when the auction flags were still tangled in the thorny rows. [19]
Dust blew red and bright in the late sun, yet the trees wore leaves like polished armor. [36]
People called this place a miracle, a wasteland orchard thriving amid radioactive dust storms, and they traded stories to make the miracle easy to sleep beside. [62]
I am a conspiracy debunker, which is to say I try to excavate truth from comfortable lies, and miracles make me itch. [84]
My notes call me sharply observant, though that was a label pasted on me by editors who prefer personality to patience. [105]
The caretaker met me at the gate, a man in a lead-threaded coat who introduced himself only as Klay. [124]
He said the orchard endured because the valley remembered rain, because the trees had grit, because faith runs deeper than fallout. [145]
Comfortable lies, I thought, but he spoke them the way a man clutches a heating stone. [161]
I had come to debunk the newest story, the one about a flawed diamond rumored to be cursed, a jewel buried under the oldest tree. [186]
According to the market boards, harvesters who tried to dig it up lost their teeth, lost their maps, lost their sense of north. [209]
The orchard had become a test case for my method: listen to the myth, find the seam, and pull until the cloth shows its weave. [234]
What I did not expect was the absolute quiet at the center of the grove, a pool of still air where dust fell straight down as if on strings. [263]
Klay called it a hidden stillpoint and would not cross into it, though he watched me step through as if I were walking into a confession. [289]
Inside the stillness, I could hear the trees drink, a faint ticking like cooled glass that resolved into a pattern. [309]
I laid a palm on the bark and felt a shiver as if something below was tuned to my pulse. [329]
There was a shack by the irrigation tanks, a ruin chewed by wind where papers had been fed through a shredder and then spilled back out by impatience. [357]
I carried the strips into the stillpoint so they would not blow away and began to read a letter in a hundred pieces. [380]
By reassembling shredded letters, I could intuit what the orchard had been built to do, and who had paid to hide it. [402]
The headers named a dissolved outfit called Stillwater Remediation, a subsidiary spun off in the last days before the liquidation. [422]
They were licensed to stabilize microclimates around collapsed reactors, to bank contamination in predictable eddies, to clip the teeth of a storm. [444]
The notes described a diamond, flawed at the heart by a stress feather, mounted in a wind harp that sang at frequencies no ear could hold. [470]
The defect made the stone ring crooked, and in that crookedness the air lost its rage and dropped its cargo. [490]
The orchard was not a miracle, but a net, a place where radioactive dust fell cleanly enough to sweep and sell as reclaim, leaving the trees to drink filtered light. [520]
Stillwater billed it as a kindness to the region, and Klay had been the foreman until the cash ran dry and the parent company folded it into silence. [548]
He shredded the letters when the inspectors came, then stayed to guard the trees and keep the story sweet. [567]
I asked about the diamond, and Klay looked at the ground like it might answer for him. [584]
He said the stone was cursed because it kept the stillpoint honest, because every liar who carried it felt the wind return to its true direction. [610]
I asked to see it, and he led me to a scarecrow whose ribs were welded rebar and whose chest held a velvet pouch wired to the harp. [638]
The diamond was no jewelers dream; a milky eye ran through it, like a cataract catching a star. [656]
I held it in the stillpoint and listened to my blood slow, and I understood why thieves lost their maps. [676]
Outside the stillness is noise, I said, and noise makes your compass listen to the wrong song. [693]
Inside, the song is one note, and the body believes it. [704]
Klay asked what I would write, because that was the only question that could change the place without moving a stone. [725]
I told him I would write what was there: a hidden stillpoint made by engineering, a flawed diamond not cursed but dangerous in the way truth rearranges a life. [754]
He closed his eyes as the dust began to build at the orchard edge and asked if I could leave the names out. [777]</story>
