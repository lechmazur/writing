I climbed to the midnight glade above clouds with cards, a tablecloth, and a cracked saucer, my lungs stinging at the height. [22]
I am an onyx-ink cartomancer, apprenticed by stormlight, paid in apologies and weathered clocks. [36]
Tonight, after the birth, I left the sleeping house to find where lost time accumulates. [51]
The midwife said to rest, but the stars were awake and counting me backward. [65]
I am willingly perplexed by the way joy and dread braid, and I wanted the braid mapped. [82]
My family taught a family custom of tracing hands on birthday tablecloths, so I carried the cloth like a humble star chart. [104]
Under pine and frost, I unfasten the satchel and set out the cloth beside the cards. [120]
The saucer came from a dolls' tea set, and the dolls' tea set saucer crack veined it like a sudden river. [141]
My mother used it to measure our first words by catching steam and letting it write on glass. [159]
When she died, I read raindrops in its glaze, and the crack answered without kindness. [174]
Tonight it will answer to a different name: cloudbound repentance. [184]
I shuffle the onyx cards, blacker than the needles shadowing the moon, and speak to the glade like an errant child. [205]
Forgive the hours I will miss while counting tiny breaths, and forgive the hours that already miscounted me. [223]
I lay the cloth, smooth as sleep, then trace my palm where heat still remembers the baby's fist. [241]
The outline becomes a doorway, and the cards fall into it like birds deciding a direction at last. [259]
I breathe the pine honey, and it tastes like a warning and a prayer arguing inside the same throat. [278]
In the spread, the Hourglass covers the Cradle, then the Bridge crosses both, shivering the saucer with a faraway sound. [298]
I see it clearly: a reservoir of minutes pooled in the clouds, a secret lake of seconds left behind. [317]
They fall from mouths that forgot the last line, from calendars that stopped for grief, from children who slept through cake. [338]
I have been throwing time away like rice at ceremonies, certain abundance would sweep the floor. [354]
Now the glade demands that I go fetch what can be gathered back, and repent in the only direction left. [374]
I loosen my coat, unfasten the brooch my grandmother wore to births and funerals, and let it mark the cloth like a compass. [397]
She taught me to trace our hands every year, saying the tablecloth must learn our growth the way a tree learns storms. [419]
The cloth is a palimpsest of handshapes, some gone to fray, some bright as new leaves, and mine begins to tremble. [440]
In the tremble I hear my daughter's unnamed laugh rehearsing itself, a future rehearsal that aches like birth still breathing. [460]
I lower the saucer until the crack aligns with the traced palm, and the cards blink with a small nocturnal intelligence. [481]
Show me where the lost minutes roll to a stop, I say, and the clouds answer by lifting a path like a throat. [504]
A narrow shine runs through the vapor, and beneath it, a ravine of quiet chimes, patient as pennies in a well. [525]
I step until my boots lift the dew, and I catch minutes in the saucer, each one glinting like an apology finally believed. [548]
For every minute I promise something exact: an hour without a phone, a letter to a living aunt, a walk at dusk with no errands. [573]
The saucer fills, and the crack holds firm, like a healed scar that still remembers the lightning but refuses to reopen. [594]
I pour the saved minutes onto the tablecloth, and they soak into the handprints until the fabric warms like bread. [614]
The outline of my palm reshapes, widening, as if making room for the fist that will learn to open. [633]
There are still more minutes shivering in the channel, and I understand they belong to people I will never meet. [653]
I bow without words, cloudbound repentance thick in the pine air, and the weight of my gratitude nearly breaks me. [673]
Then I gather the cards, fold the cloth, and cradle the saucer, listening until the chimes slow to a sleeping heart. [694]
The path softens back into cloud, the glade empties of omen, and the sky accepts my footprints like a mother. [714]
I walk home under a thinner moon, carrying hours that do not weigh but press the chest with choking beauty. [734]
Inside, the baby hiccups, a bright mistake of delight, and we are two clocks trying to agree on morning. [753]
I trace her sleeping hand over mine on the cloth, whisper my promises again, and feel the minutes assent like dew. [774]
After the birth there is only this: the willingness to be perplexed, and the courage to spend what I learned to recover. [796]
