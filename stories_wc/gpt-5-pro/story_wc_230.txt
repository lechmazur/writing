<story>After the empathy virus, I kept foraging among the hanging orchard in a ravine battered by storms, because the trees listened and the soil still reasoned. [26]
I am a rational truffle forager, methodical about spores and seasons, suspicious of charms, prizing clear evidence over whispers. [45]
Yet the virus wired me to be involuntarily truthful, so even my caution bared itself like roots after a washout. [65]
I kept working here to cultivate psychological safety, a canopy of trust where honesty would not bruise, where confessions could compost into something nourishing. [89]
The only tool that seemed to promise shade came as a smuggled relic, an antique glass eye boxed in straw and wrapped with contraband figs. [114]
A courier waded the torrent to hand it over, then left without a receipt, like everyone does now when truth cannot be bargained. [137]
Rumor said the eye could occlude what hurts, filtering speech through a veil of merciful imprecision, a lens polished by saints and liars alike. [161]
I did not trust rumor, only method, so I studied it through rumored cures in discredited textbooks, those banished manuals of fracture wards and feeling science. [187]
Above me the orchard hung from iron lines stapled into cliff faces, trunks swaying like pendulums, leaves slick with brine from the ocean storms that keep returning. [214]
I knelt with my trowel, searching for black truffles nested in the roots, their mycelium threading tree to tree, moderating thirst and maybe, I hoped, feeling. [240]
I planned a table beneath the cables, a weekly circle where we would eat, listen, and practice sentences that carried truth without cutting. [263]
The glass eye watched from its velvet socket, the iris a stormgreen spiral, flecked with mica, medical yet ceremonial, ambiguous as a tide chart drawn by a poet. [291]
I designed trials, because I am rational, because the world deserves more than hope, because lives tilt when hunches pretend to be pillars. [314]
First, I placed the eye on a branch and spoke to it about my father, about the day he admitted he wanted to flee our town. [340]
The words poured clear, involuntarily truthful as ever, but their edges rounded, as though the lens had sanded them, as though my mouth wore river stones. [366]
I invited the orchard crew, three neighbors whose faces still walked through grief, and we gathered while the ravine hummed with runoff and swallows. [390]
Mara, whose kid had confessed away a marriage; Jiro, who could not lie about hunger; and Old Fen, whose jokes lost their timing. [413]
I set the eye in the center and offered rules to cultivate psychological safety, not silence, not denial, only breathing room for the honesty we could not stop. [441]
We would talk toward the eye, letting it occlude the glare of accusation, like fog that makes lights kinder without hiding the road. [464]
The textbooks had suggested this practice, in a footnote nobody cites, claiming displaced focus reshapes confession into collaboration, a rumored cure I could measure only by outcomes. [491]
Mara spoke first, saying she blamed herself for demanding the truth; the eye listened, and the orchard answered with drips, and her words softened without breaking. [517]
Jiro admitted he hoarded fruit, and we passed him bread; Old Fen confessed envy, then laughed wetly, and I shaved truffles into warm oil for everyone. [543]
The virus still compelled our tongues, yet the circle held, and the storms raged above, and for a while our answers wore soft bark instead of knives. [570]
I hated that the eye was a smuggled relic, likely stolen from a shrine or a clinic, but I hated more the gash the world had become. [597]
Each meeting I logged outcomes like rainfall, noting pulse, tears, repaired plans, because magic is only pattern until verified, and I am accountable to the grove. [623]
A week later the courier returned demanding the relic, and I realized the circle should not depend on contraband, so I tucked the eye beneath a truffle bed. [651]
There, the mycelium would study it more humbly than we had, and the earth would occlude its shine, leaving us to practice gentler speech unaided. [676]
I still forage in the battered ravine, rational as rainfall, truthful as the virus insists, and our circle holds with fractured grace like cables after weather. [702]</story>
