After the past life memory surfaces, I return to the twilight viaduct in bloom with my box. [17]
I am a camera obscura artist, spiritually curious, and my box is a breathing lantern. [32]
Tonight it waits like a gentle animal under the arches, fog collecting in the longer stones. [48]
After months awake, I have come to find where unused love is stored. [61]
The memory rose yesterday, a shoreline of faces I had abandoned to my smaller breaths. [76]
Among them stood a woman carrying kwan yin's tear, a glass drop that corrected the light into mercy. [94]
When I woke, the stone arches hummed in me, asking me to heal what I had blurred. [111]
So I brought the tear I found in a thrifted prayer, and threaded it before my pinhole. [128]
Its tiny oval makes the images soften like fruit left in shade, gentle and patient. [143]
A friend arrives from upriver, a pilgrim of sparks, wheeling steel wool and a battered whisk. [159]
He walks with the careful grace of someone who survived both fire and silence. [173]
We do not speak much, for the air itself carries foggy lucidity, a language of dew. [189]
I show him the bellows I stitched to my ribs, canvas cuffs tightening with each inhale. [205]
Through a length of clear tubing, my breath opens the aperture, then closes it like a tide. [222]
I learned revealing through breathing changes when a monk taught me to listen for the unseen shutter. [239]
He said, let your lungs act as ocean, and let the picture admit the world's pulse. [255]
I nod now toward the arches, and my friend sets his whisk glowing with quick, bright wool. [272]
He becomes a slow comet under the bridge, a pilgrim of sparks writing constellations where pigeons sleep. [289]
With each of his circles I breathe deeper, and the bellows pull open the small room of light. [307]
The image takes root on salted paper, the viaduct in bloom turning to nebula in my box. [324]
I swear I hear the past change its breathing, syncing with mine, gently loosening its knot. [340]
The woman with the glass drop waits at the periphery of memory, not accusing, only asking to enter. [358]
I invite her by widening my diaphragm, and the aperture agrees, spilling a soft corridor of day. [375]
We set the frame where the weeds bloom through cracked mortar, tiny trumpets offering pollen and patience. [392]
I tell my friend the purpose plainly, to find where unused love is stored, and how to open it. [411]
He nods and keeps walking circles, as if drawing a lock I will learn to turn. [427]
I breathe shallow and the image thins, a sorrow line, a faint echo of an unsent letter. [444]
I breathe full and the shadows bloom, revealing a hand waiting, a cup of tea cooling unseen. [461]
Unused love gathers there, in pauses, in the cooling, in breaths not taken once the door closed. [478]
It pools in the ribs, in the archway of the chest, and it aches to flow. [494]
Through the tear's oval I watch the ache become light, a pliable filament seeking a circuit. [510]
My friend pauses at the pillar, and I ask him to hold still and to breathe with me. [528]
We practice revealing through breathing changes, letting the exposure lengthen in tandem until our hearts find the same shore. [547]
When our lungs agree, the picture steadies, and the woman steps in as if crossing a river. [564]
Her face is not reproach but refuge, and she teaches me how to heal without owning. [580]
She hands me the old kettle of steam I never poured, and I watch it condense on film. [598]
The droplets arrange as a code of forgiveness, dots and curls that resemble wildflower seeds. [613]
We decode it by breathing again, slower now, and the emulsion blooms with arches full of tender rooms. [631]
In each room the unused love is a lamp waiting for its oil, which is attention given freely. [649]
The oil lives in the ribs opening, in the exhale that blesses what is present and imperfect. [666]
I realize the storehouse is breath, and the key is to spend it in attentive kindness. [682]
The picture dries as a small mercy, and my friend lowers the whisk like a moon finished with burning. [701]
The viaduct in bloom seems to lean closer, vines breathing, mortar sighing, the river offering simple applause. [718]
I pack the box gently, ensuring kwan yin's tear is clean, and I tuck the salted prints away. [736]
We walk home under wisps of moths, two quiet lungs, carrying images that will teach others to breathe. [754]
Tonight I will deliver them to those who wait alone, and together we will practice the opening. [771]
We will heal by revealing through breathing changes, by letting love move until it is used as light. [789]
