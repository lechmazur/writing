<story>The storm-worn windblown parapet in mist holds its breath like an old swimmer. [13]
Everything here settles into a furrowed hush before anything important dares to be said. [27]
I am the prisoner exchange negotiator, and the stones know my footsteps now. [40]
People call me uncommonly thoughtful, though I think of it as listening without flinching. [54]
This fort and its ragged crown are neutral territory, by oath and by need. [68]
We meet in the hour between apology and forgiveness, where the tongue and the heart argue. [84]
Our schedules are kept by synchronizing through moon phases, because clocks choose sides when tempers spike. [100]
The tide obeys that pale metronome, and boats from both banks survive when we do. [115]
Tonight the mist is a low chorus, thinning and thickening as if breathing with us. [130]
Two delegations ascend the spiraled approaches, each carrying the names of loved ones in silence. [145]
A small chest waits in the watch niche, its antique drawer pull cold as gull bone. [161]
Inside are pledges, seals, ration notes, a tiny ledger of griefs kept honest by light. [176]
The drawer pull once clung to my grandmother's desk, where I learned to weigh words. [191]
I carry it to remember my promise to recycle mistakes into wisdom, no loss ignored. [206]
Last winter I read a torn flag as consent, and two boys limped home late. [221]
Their mothers still blink hard when they see me, and my chest holds their breath. [236]
So I do my work in a furrowed hush, a garden for careful words. [250]
At the appointed mark, I untether the signal lantern, letting its hood fall and flame speak. [266]
The two parties stop where stones widen, neither trespassing, both steadied by the neutral edge. [281]
This is neutral territory, I say, and we will all leave with more time than pride. [297]
On my left stands Neris, gaunt and furious; on my right, old Captain Bram with tremor. [313]
Each has prepared an apology that fits their own throat, but not the other's ear. [328]
Between them wait six prisoners whose eyes shimmer like coins lost and found by tide. [343]
I open the chest, the antique drawer pull rocking as if nodding at the old rules. [359]
I recite the names in pairs, their release paths traced like wet chalk over stone. [374]
Before I signal the crossing, I ask for what we all owe: plain words without armor. [390]
Neris squares his shoulders and says he is sorry for the raid that burned orchards. [405]
He says hunger taught him cruelty, and it was a teacher he should have refused. [420]
Bram clears his throat and admits his patrol cut nets and mocked families for poor bait. [436]
In the pause that follows, we stand between apology and forgiveness, a bridgeless span over dark. [452]
A thin prisoner named Daro refuses to step until someone says his name with the apology. [468]
I ask Neris to try again, and I hand him the ledger, finger on Daro's line. [484]
Neris looks at the mist and then at Daro, and he says it right, slowly. [499]
Bram answers by naming the net-mender he mocked, promises repairs, and lifts his palms, ungloved. [514]
I raise the lantern, and first two prisoners cross, light flickering like minnows between boots. [529]
A gust claws the tower, and I watch the moon's smudge, aligning breath to that tide. [545]
When Daro nods, I tell the guards to untether his wrists, and he walks unshaking. [560]
A young guard barks for haste, but I remind him this parapet holds only neutral weight. [576]
I swing the chest open again, the antique drawer pull revealing the oath page with seals. [592]
By the moon's patient arithmetic, one by one the others cross, leaving bundle-heavy shadows behind. [607]
When the last handshake lands, the mist lifts just enough to show bruised water unresentful. [622]
I note each snag in my book: what failed, what breathed, how to recycle mistakes into wisdom. [639]
I touch the drawer pull, remembering my grandmother's hands teaching patience like turning pages underwater. [654]
It is still between apology and forgiveness, and that is a country I can steward. [669]
I close the chest and the antique drawer pull clicks like a small bell inside fog. [685]
Careful steps carry me off the parapet, where gulls seem to practice forgiveness less grudgingly. [700]
I will keep choosing neutral territory, synchronizing through moon phases until the old anger forgets clocks. [716]
And I will hold this furrowed hush until those who cross can breathe without armor. [731]</story>
