We live after time becomes visible, and the corridors of the baroque asteroid shine with threads like bronze rain. [19]
I am a defunct revolutionary, still poetically inclined enough to read meanings in every eddy of chronology. [36]
The glow over the ruins carries burnished sorrow, a patina of time polishing even our regrets. [52]
When the storms gather, we honor the old method by covering mirrors during storms, so memory does not multiply. [71]
I am Neris, custodian of Lattice Vault Seven, and my task is to arbitrate an archaeological dispute. [88]
House Vark claims the relics show decadence, while the Cooperative insists the old city chose transcendence. [104]
At the center of the case lies a crystal vase shard, its facets veined with slow amber wind. [122]
Within it, time strings itself like harp wires, humming when the storms comb through the galleries. [138]
I want the verdict to reimagine an entire civilization, not reduce it to ruinous excess. [153]
Once I carried banners, then I was labeled a defunct revolutionary when the last uprising folded like paper. [171]
Still I am poetically inclined, and the asteroid listens when words are chosen with care. [186]
Baroque arches bulge from nickel cliffs, cherubs cut into ore, and gilt veins rise like liturgy from the crust. [205]
The tribunal convenes beneath a vault of walking seconds, each moment trailing dust like comet hair. [221]
Since time became visible, it blooms in color bands only children can name, and adults pretend to measure. [239]
I present the shard, cradle it in a sling of woven wire, and ask the room to watch it sing. [259]
Master Vark smiles, certain the music will sound like an empire cracking under its gaudy weight. [275]
But I devise a calibration the old poets hinted at, a rhythm of breath matched to the storm. [293]
We dim the lamps, cover our mirrors with velvet as taught, covering mirrors during storms to quiet the chorus. [312]
The visible seconds settle, like fish in a clear bowl, and the shard releases a scene. [328]
We see the Ancients arranging rooms to catch the river of time, folding it into patterns like brocade. [346]
Their children dart along the strands, guiding days toward murals where histories bloom into luminous scripts. [362]
What Vark calls decadence is choreography, an ethics of attention scored against the weather of eternity. [378]
Silence steadies the hall while the seconds walk like tame animals around the speaker stones. [393]
I tell them the shard was found not in a midden but in a nursery, rim polished by small hands. [413]
A fragment of teaching, shaped to be held, and tuned for poetically inclined listeners who could keep pace. [431]
Vark counters that the figures kneel too long, that worship ruined them, that time punished their pride. [448]
I answer as a defunct revolutionary who learned that kneeling can be strategy, a way to move under fire. [467]
They did not bow to a tyrant, I say, but to the current, to steer it through the rooms we still inhabit. [489]
If we learn their craft, we might repair our days, and remorse could become architecture instead of ash. [507]
The judge asks for law, not longing, and reminds us that salvage rights do not extend to dreams. [525]
So I tilt the shard again, and a second tableau unspools, a council room much like ours. [542]
Their elders argue an archaeological dispute about whether to bury their works or weave them into time itself. [560]
They vote to braid everything into the seconds, trusting that later hearts will hear the harmonies and judge kindly. [579]
The hall swallows another hush, burnished sorrow rippling across the faces as if polished by tides. [595]
The judge asks what I want, and I speak plainly because the storms are almost at the windows. [613]
I want liberty to reimagine an entire civilization, not as opulence decayed but as craft unfinished by catastrophe. [631]
Let us restore their rooms, teach their breathing, and seed schools that read the seconds for civic duty. [649]
Give the shard to the children, not the traders, so a chorus of small hands can tune the halls. [668]
The judge leans back, and the storm strikes, making the window seconds bang like shutters in squalls. [685]
We move as one to cover the mirrors, seasoned by old cautions, and the room darkens into mercy. [703]
When the thunder softens, the judge declares the city an open conservatory, not a quarry, and grants us time. [722]
Vark bows, annoyed but alive to history, and leaves with a thin smile that promises grudges. [738]
I return to my quarters and drape the last mirror, because to steward time is to touch its ache. [757]
In the hush I write a few lines that devise a future, not in slogans, but in practiced breath. [776]
The asteroid answers with faint harmonies, burnished sorrow turning warm, and even my defunct heart considers revolt again. [794]
