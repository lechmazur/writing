The observatory’s dome groaned as the last sliver of sun bled into the horizon, casting long fingers of amber across the dust-choked floor. [18]
Elias traced the cracks in the stone with his skeletal fingers, the weight of centuries pressing against his ribs like a forgotten hymn. [42]
He had come here not to reap, but to remember—though the dead had no need of memory, and the living rarely thanked him for it. [76]

The atlas page lay unfolded on the brass lectern, its edges frayed like the frayed edges of his patience. [99]
Sea monsters coiled in the margins, their inked scales catching the dim light, whispering of depths he had never dared to plumb. [129]
Elias had found it tucked between the pages of an almanac, left behind by some long-dead astronomer who had scribbled notes in the margins: *"The stars do not weep, but they remember."* [163]
The words echoed in his skull, a phrase half-forgotten, half-reclaimed, like a name on the tip of a dying man’s tongue. [193]

He had listened to the old recordings first, of course. [204]
The wax cylinders, brittle with age, had preserved the voices of scholars who had once stood where he stood now, their words crackling like static from the void. [234]
*"The dead are not silent,"* one had said. *"They are waiting for someone to speak their names."* [256]
Elias had played them again and again, until the grooves wore smooth and the voices became his own. [280]

That was his motivation, though he would never admit it aloud: to give names to nameless fears. [302]
The sea monsters on the atlas page had no labels, no legends to tether them to the world. [324]
They were shadows given form, fears crystallized through scattered light—like the way the setting sun turned the observatory’s lenses into prisms, fracturing the dusk into jagged rainbows that danced across the walls. [369]
Elias reached out, letting the light pool in his palm, watching as it hardened into something solid, something almost real. [395]

The echo of sacrifice hummed in the air, a vibration he felt in his hollow bones. [416]
He had seen it before, in the way the living clutched at each other when death came calling, in the way they offered up their tears like currency. [450]
But the dead had no use for tears. [460]
They only wanted to be seen. [467]

Elias pressed his hand to the atlas page, feeling the ink rise to meet his touch. [483]
The sea monsters stirred, their bodies uncoiling as if waking from a long sleep. [504]
One by one, he whispered their names—the ones he had heard in the recordings, the ones he had stolen from the lips of the dying, the ones he had carried in his chest like shards of glass. [550]
*"Leviathan,"* he murmured, and the first beast bowed its head. [565]
*"Kraken,"* he said, and the second stilled, its many arms folding in on themselves. [587]
*"Siren,"* he breathed, and the third dissolved into mist, its song lingering like a sigh. [610]

The observatory trembled. [613]
The scattered light crystallized into a single beam, piercing the dome and lancing into the sky. [634]
Elias closed his eyes, letting the echo of his own voice wash over him—*"I see you,"* it whispered, *"I see you, I see you."* [667]
The sea monsters were gone, but the atlas page remained, now blank except for a single phrase etched in gold: *"The stars remember, and so do I."* [707]

He rolled the page carefully, tucking it into the pocket of his robe. [725]
The sun had set, and the observatory was dark, but Elias no longer felt the weight of the centuries. [750]
For the first time in a long time, he had given something back. [768]
And the dead, at last, were silent. [778]
[780]
