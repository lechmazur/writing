The prism sanctuary shimmered under starlight, its walls alive with refracted colors that danced like trapped fireflies. [14]
Elias Veyne adjusted his cracked spectacles, the lenses mended a dozen times with wax and wire, and traced the fractured light to its source—a single, unbroken pane of stained glass at the sanctuary’s heart. [50]
He had come to restore the broken mask of the Fisher King, but the mask was not what it seemed. [72]
It was not porcelain or wood, but woven from threads so fine they seemed to drink the light, its surface a shifting mosaic of faces—some weeping, some screaming, all silent. [105]
Elias had spent years restoring masks that held the echoes of the dead, but this one *accumulated silence*, thickening the air around it like fog. [135]

His fingers trembled as he withdrew the tapestry needle from his coat, its eye threaded with a single strand of silver. [160]
The needle was no ordinary tool—it had been forged in the same fire that had tempered the Fisher King’s net, the one said to have caught the voices of drowned sailors before they could reach the shore. [199]
Elias had stolen it from a museum in the dead of night, though he told himself it was not theft if the object had been misplaced by time. [235]
Now, it was the only thing sharp enough to pierce the mask’s weave without tearing it further. [256]

The sanctuary’s silence pressed against his ears, a living thing. [269]
He had heard of the *interlaced hush*—a phenomenon where sound did not merely fade but braided itself into something heavier, something that could strangle a man if he listened too long. [308]
The mask was its vessel. [313]
And the restless spirits it held? They were not at peace, but *grounded*, trapped in the threads like insects in amber. [341]

Elias exhaled, his breath misting in the cold. [352]
He had to *exhume* them. [356]
Not from earth, but from the net that bound them. [369]
The Fisher King’s net hung from the sanctuary’s rafters, a tattered relic of rope and seaweed, its knots so intricate they seemed to writhe when the light hit them just right. [409]
Elias climbed the ladder, the wood groaning under his weight, and reached for the first knot. [437]
His hands remembered the motion before his mind did—*by unraveling knots in a centuries-old fisherman’s net*—the method passed down through generations of mask restorers, though none had ever attempted it on something so vast. [489]

The first knot loosened with a whisper. [501]
A voice, faint as a child’s sigh, slipped free. [512]
Elias flinched, but he did not stop. [518]
The second knot unraveled, and a woman’s laughter bubbled up, bright and then gone. [542]
The third released a sob, raw and choking. [554]
With each knot, the sanctuary’s silence deepened, as if the hush were drinking the sounds it had swallowed for centuries. [590]

Across the room, the mask pulsed. [597]
Its threads writhed like living things, and Elias realized with a cold certainty that the spirits were not just *in* the mask—they were *part* of it. [636]
To free them, he would have to unmake the mask itself. [651]
He hesitated, the tapestry needle poised above the first stitch. [665]
This was not restoration. [670]
This was butchery. [673]

A hand clamped onto his shoulder. [680]
Elias turned to see the Fisher King standing behind him, his face a ruin of barnacles and old scars, his eyes two black pits. [713]
"You don’t understand what you’re doing," the King rasped, his voice like gravel under tide. [738]
Elias swallowed. [742]
"I’m setting them free," he said. [749]
The King’s grip tightened. [754]
"Some things should stay buried." [762]

Elias thought of the secret he had shared with no one—not even the sanctuary’s keeper. [788]
He had heard the mask’s voices in his dreams for years, their pleas rising like smoke from the cracks in his own mind. [822]
He could not ignore them. [827]
Not anymore. [829]

He drove the needle into the mask. [836]
The threads screamed. [840]
[841]
