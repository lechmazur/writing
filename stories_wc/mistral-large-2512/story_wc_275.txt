The glass dome of the desert rose farm shimmered under the twin suns, its curved surface fracturing the light into a thousand tranquil blazes. [17]
Liora knelt in the warm soil, her fingers brushing the velvety petals of a rose that bloomed in defiance of the arid world beyond. [41]
She had come here after the tower fell, when the sky was still choked with dust and the air tasted of rust. [67]
Her father, a bounty hunter known for his ruthless efficiency, had once told her that chaos was the only constant—yet here, in this fragile enclosure, she sought to weave continuity through it. [111]

The ballast sandbag scrap lay half-buried near the irrigation line, its coarse fabric frayed at the edges. [132]
Liora didn’t remember bringing it inside, but the desert had a way of leaving its mark on everything. [156]
She picked it up, turning it over to reveal the engraved quiet of her father’s initials stitched into the canvas: *J.V.*, jagged and precise, like the man himself. [190]
A relic from his airship, perhaps, or one of the many tools he’d discarded when the tower’s collapse forced him to ground his fleet. [222]

Her father had never understood her senselessly perceptive nature—the way she noticed the way a leaf curled before it withered, or how the wind carried the scent of rain hours before it fell. [258]
To him, the world was a ledger of debts and bounties, not a tapestry of hidden patterns. [279]
But Liora saw the threads, and she pulled at them, inculcating the desert roses with values she wished the world would hold: patience, resilience, the quiet strength of a thing that thrives where nothing else can. [326]

A shadow passed over the dome, and Liora looked up to see her father standing at the entrance, his silhouette framed by the harsh light outside. [358]
He had come for her, as she knew he would. [370]
The bounty on her head was too tempting, even for him. [383]
She stood slowly, brushing the dirt from her knees, and reached for the knife at her belt—not to draw it, but to sheathe it properly, the way he’d taught her. [419]
The gesture was deliberate, a silent acknowledgment of the lessons he’d given her, even if she’d bent them into something he didn’t recognize. [457]

“You always were too soft,” he said, stepping inside. [470]
The glass door hissed shut behind him, sealing them in the humid warmth of the farm. [490]
Liora didn’t answer. [493]
Instead, she held out the sandbag scrap, the initials catching the light. [511]
“You left this behind,” she said. [518]
His jaw tightened, but he took it, his fingers brushing the stitches as if they were a language he’d forgotten. [546]

She turned back to the roses, plucking a single bloom and pressing it into his palm. [565]
“They grow in the cracks of the world,” she said. [575]
“Just like you taught me to survive.” [584]
For the first time, his eyes flickered with something other than calculation. [599]
Maybe it was the way the petals trembled in his calloused hand, or maybe it was the quiet defiance of a daughter who had taken his violence and spun it into something living. [642]

Outside, the wind howled against the dome, but inside, the air was still. [659]
Liora knelt again, her hands returning to the soil, and her father stood there, the rose wilting slightly in his grip. [687]
She had no need for words. [695]
The desert roses spoke for her, their thorns sharp, their blooms unyielding. [714]
And in that moment, between the engraved quiet of the past and the tranquil blaze of the present, she wove the only continuity that mattered. [748]

The bounty would remain unclaimed. [755]
The tower’s fall had changed nothing—and everything. [765]
Liora exhaled, her breath steady, and let the soil cradle her fingers. [780]
The world outside could burn, but here, life persisted. [793]
And that was enough. [797]
