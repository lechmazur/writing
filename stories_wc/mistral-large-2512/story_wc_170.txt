The terrace stretched like a breath held too long, its stone railing slick with the afternoon’s last rain, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and blossoming jasmine. [22]
Liora stood there, her fingers tracing the prism parapet, the facets catching the dying light and scattering it into fractured rainbows across the wet pavement. [50]
She had come to paint the mirage again—the one that only she could see, the one that flickered at the edges of perception, just beyond the reach of ordinary eyes. [87]
But today, the mirage was different. [93]
It pulsed, not with light, but with something deeper, something that thrummed beneath her ribs like a borrowed heartbeat. [120]

She had first noticed it years ago, when she was still a child, humming the lullabies her mother had sung—songs that weren’t quite songs, but coded messages, woven into melodies so old no one remembered their origins. [160]
The notes carried weight, bending the air around her, and for the briefest moments, the world would soften, edges blurring into possibility. [188]
Her mother had called it grace, the way the unseen could be coaxed into being, if only you knew how to listen. [215]

Now, Liora was the last who remembered. [221]
The terrace echoed with the ghosts of those lullabies, the stone beneath her feet vibrating with the memory of voices long gone. [249]
She closed her eyes and let the dusky harmony of the hour settle over her, the hush before the evening bells, when the world held its breath. [278]
This was the only time the mirage would appear—when the light was neither day nor night, when the air was perceptively calm, as if the universe itself was waiting. [315]

She unrolled her canvas, the fabric stiff with age, and dipped her brush into the paint. [333]
The colors were not her own; they were borrowed, stolen from the prism’s refractions, from the way the rainbows bled into the stone. [360]
She painted not what she saw, but what she felt—the borrowed heartbeat, the promise of something more. [383]
The strokes were deliberate, each one a plea to the mirrors of the world, to show not what was, but what could be. [412]

A shadow fell across her work. [417]
Liora didn’t turn. [420]
She knew who it was—the old watchman, his boots scuffing against the terrace’s edge, his breath steady despite the years. [450]
“You’re still here,” he said, his voice rough but not unkind. [467]
“So are you,” she replied, her brush never pausing. [474]
He chuckled, a sound like dry leaves. [481]
“I come to listen to the bells,” he admitted. [491]
“And I come to hear what comes before them.” [502]

The watchman leaned against the parapet, his gaze fixed on the horizon where the mirage shimmered, just beyond the reach of his sight. [536]
“You think you can persuade the mirrors to show something new?” he asked. [554]
Liora smiled, her fingers tightening around the brush. [565]
“Not persuade,” she said. “Remind.” [572]
The lullabies had always been about memory, about the way the past could bend the present if you let it. [600]

The first chime of the bells rang out, sharp and clear, cutting through the hush. [620]
The mirage flickered, then steadied, its edges sharpening into something almost real—a city that wasn’t there, a sky that had never been. [652]
Liora’s heart pounded in time with the borrowed rhythm, the one that had always guided her. [675]
She painted faster, her movements fluid, effortless, as if the grace her mother had spoken of was finally hers to claim. [708]

The watchman watched, his expression unreadable. [716]
“Do you ever wonder if it’s real?” he asked. [728]
Liora didn’t answer. [732]
She was too busy watching the mirrors of the world shift, their surfaces rippling with possibilities. [755]
The terrace echoed with the sound of her brush, the coded lullabies humming beneath her breath, the borrowed heartbeat steady and sure. [785]
And for the first time, she didn’t just see the mirage. [798]
She believed in it. [801]
