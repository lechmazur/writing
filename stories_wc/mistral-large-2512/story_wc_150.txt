The ship creaked as it docked in the harbor of Varethis, the city of my childhood now foreign after twenty years in the eastern archipelagos. [19]
Salt spray stung my face, but I barely noticed—my gaze was fixed on the jagged silhouette of the Necropolis Hills, where the catacomb orchard sprawled like a wound in the earth. [54]
I had returned not as a conqueror, nor as a prodigal son, but as a man clutching a single relic: the sundial base, its brass surface etched with the names of the dead. [90]
The elders had called it a fool’s errand, but I knew better. [100]
Faith wasn’t lost; it was buried, waiting to be unearthed. [111]

The orchard’s entrance was a yawning fissure, its edges lined with pomegranate trees whose roots coiled around skeletal fingers. [133]
I stepped inside, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and something older—myrrh, perhaps, or the ghost of incense long burned out. [158]
A warmly curious hum settled in my chest as I traced the roots, their tendrils weaving between ribs like threads in a tapestry of the forgotten. [185]
This was no mere graveyard; it was a library of the dead, and I intended to read it. [204]

The first tomb I uncovered was small, its entrance sealed with a slab of limestone. [219]
I pried it loose with a crowbar, the stone groaning like a waking sleeper. [234]
Inside, the air was stale, but the walls—oh, the walls were alive with frescoes: pilgrims kneeling before a radiant figure, their hands outstretched toward a sundial identical to the one I carried. [270]
My breath hitched. [273]
This wasn’t just a tomb; it was a shrine. [281]

Days bled into nights as I worked, my hands blistered from digging, my back aching from crouching in the cramped tunnels. [307]
I rebuilt not with mortar and stone, but with purposeful wandering—letting the roots guide me, following the whispers of the frescoes, piecing together the fragments of a faith that had been scattered like seeds in the wind. [350]
Each discovery was an interruption, a detour that led me deeper into the orchard’s heart. [370]
A child’s sandal, perfectly preserved, its straps still tied. [379]
A priest’s censer, its bowl blackened with centuries of ash. [391]
A mural of the sundial, its gnomon casting a shadow not on stone, but on the upturned faces of the faithful. [418]

On the seventh day, I found the central chamber. [427]
It was vast, its ceiling lost in darkness, its floor a mosaic of bones arranged in the shape of a sundial’s face. [453]
At its center stood a pedestal, empty except for a single, shallow depression—the exact size of my relic. [477]
I placed the sundial base into the hollow, and the chamber trembled. [491]
Not with the groan of shifting earth, but with a sound like a held breath finally released. [512]

Light spilled from the frescoes, their colors bleeding into the air like ink in water. [530]
The radiant figure from the walls stepped forward—not as a ghost, but as a woman, her robes woven from sunlight and shadow. [554]
"You’ve returned," she said, her voice the rustle of leaves. [564]
I fell to my knees, not in worship, but in recognition. [576]
This was the faith I had come to restore: not a doctrine, not a temple, but the quiet certainty that some journeys, though interrupted, were never truly abandoned. [610]

She reached out, her fingers brushing the sundial’s gnomon. [624]
The shadow it cast stretched across the mosaic, and where it touched the bones, they bloomed—not into flowers, but into new roots, tender and green. [656]
The orchard sighed around us, its branches creaking like an old man rising from a long sleep. [678]
I understood then that rebuilding was not about resurrecting the past, but about tending to what had always been alive beneath the surface. [710]

As I left the catacombs, the sundial base tucked once more into my satchel, I felt the weight of twenty years lift from my shoulders. [740]
The elders would call me a fool still, but the orchard knew the truth. [755]
Faith was never lost—only waiting, patient as roots in the dark, for the right hands to uncover it. [778]
And mine, it seemed, had been the right ones all along. [791]
