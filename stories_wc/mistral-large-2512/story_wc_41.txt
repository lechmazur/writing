The junkyard prophet stood at the edge of the fog sculpture garden, his boots sinking slightly into the damp earth. [16]
Around him, ghostly figures emerged from the mist—twisted metal and rusted wire shaped into faces that seemed to whisper secrets. [38]
He had come here not to preach, but to listen, though his mind often betrayed him before the message could take root. [62]
Precognitively forgetful, he called it—a curse of seeing fragments of the future only to lose them like grains of sand through his fingers. [89]
Today, he clutched a piece of plain chalk in his palm, its edges worn smooth from use. [108]

The hush of old videotapes left unwatched hung in the air, a static silence that made his skin prickle. [129]
He had spent years trying to capture the sound of growing older, a noise like the slow unraveling of rope or the creak of a house settling into ruin. [158]
But every recording he made dissolved into white noise, as if time itself refused to be pinned down. [179]
The chalk was his latest attempt—a way to mark the moments before they slipped away. [197]

He knelt and drew a jagged line on the ground, a path only he could follow. [214]
The fog shifted, revealing a stretch of driftwood scattered near the garden’s center. [232]
His breath hitched; this was the sign he’d been waiting for. [245]
Arranging driftwood as directional markers had always been his method, a way to anchor himself in the present before the future scattered like leaves in the wind. [276]

One by one, he placed the pieces in a spiral, each stick pointing inward toward a hollow at the center. [297]
The fog curled around his ankles, thick as memory. [308]
He had come here to locate something—something he couldn’t name but could feel in the marrow of his bones. [332]
The chalk in his pocket grew warm against his thigh. [344]

A voice, thin as a reed, cut through the silence. [354]
“You’re late.” [357]
He turned to see a woman carved from the same mist as the sculptures, her edges blurred by time. [379]
She held a videotape in her hands, its label faded beyond reading. [394]
“You always forget,” she said, “but I remember for you.” [410]

His chest tightened. [415]
This was the echo he’d been clinging to—the ghost of a conversation they’d had before, or would have, or were having now in some other version of the world. [453]
He reached for the tape, but she pulled it back. [465]
“First, you have to finish,” she said, nodding at the driftwood. [479]

He swallowed hard and placed the last stick. [489]
The spiral tightened, the center now a perfect circle. [502]
The fog parted just enough to reveal a small, flat stone at its heart. [521]
On it, in his own handwriting, were the words: *The sound of growing older is the silence between heartbeats.* [551]

The woman smiled, sad and knowing. [562]
“Now you can listen,” she said, pressing the tape into his hands. [578]
He turned it over, and this time, the label was clear: *For the man who remembers too much and too little.* [603]

The world around him blurred, the sculptures melting into the fog like wax. [620]
He fumbled with the tape, his fingers clumsy with urgency. [634]
Somewhere, a VCR whirred to life, its mechanical hum the first true sound he’d heard in years. [660]

The screen flickered, and there he was—younger, standing in this same garden, holding the same piece of chalk. [689]
“You’ll forget this,” the younger version of himself said, “but it’s important.” [710]
The camera panned to the woman, her face unlined, her voice steady. [728]
“You have to keep coming back,” she told him. [740]
“Until you remember.” [746]

The recording ended, the screen dissolving into static. [758]
The junkyard prophet exhaled, his breath visible in the cold air. [772]
The fog had lifted just enough to see the path ahead, marked by the driftwood spiral. [795]
He pocketed the chalk, the tape, and stepped forward. [808]
Somewhere, the sound of growing older waited. [819]
And this time, he wouldn’t forget. [826]
