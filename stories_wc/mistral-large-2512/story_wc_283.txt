The amber warehouse clung to the underside of the cliffs like a secret, its wooden beams groaning under the weight of forgotten things. [18]
Mira had spent seven years turning the hourglass in the corner, its sand whispering against glass as if counting down to something no one else could hear. [47]
She was the hourglass turner, though no one had given her the title—it had settled on her shoulders the day she first unscrewed the lid of the canyon echo in a jar. [84]

The echo had been trapped decades ago, a fragment of a voice that had once called across the canyon and never received an answer. [113]
Mira kept it on the highest shelf, where the amber light from the single window made the glass glow like a captured sunset. [140]
She didn’t play it often, but when she did, the warehouse filled with the sound of someone else’s wisdom, a voice that had long since dissolved into the wind. [176]
It was the kind of wisdom that didn’t demand to be heard, only to be passed on—shared, like a breath held too long and finally released. [207]

The buttons arrived in a burlap sack, spilled across the workbench in a riot of colors and shapes. [227]
They were lost things, each one a story unraveled from a cuff, a collar, a coat left behind in a train station or a ship’s cabin. [254]
Mira had been cataloging them for months, not because she had to, but because the act of sorting them—by size, by material, by the faintest trace of wear—felt like unscrambling something larger. [291]
The truth, perhaps. Or maybe just the shape of it. [303]

The prophecy had been written on a scrap of paper tucked into the pocket of a child’s coat, the fabric still smelling of salt and distant rain. [334]
*"The hourglass will turn backward when the last button is found,"* it read, the ink faded but the words sharp as a blade. [359]
Mira didn’t believe in prophecies, not really, but she believed in the weight of things—buttons, echoes, the slow unraveling of time. [388]
She had come to the warehouse to spin the prophecy into raw possibility, to take its brittle edges and soften them into something that could breathe. [423]

The first button had been brass, stamped with a crown, its shank bent as if torn free in a struggle. [447]
The second was mother-of-pearl, smooth and cool, with a tiny chip where it had once caught the light just so. [471]
By the time she reached the hundredth—a dull black plastic disc, the kind that held together the cheapest of coats—she had begun to see patterns. [502]
Not in the buttons themselves, but in the spaces between them, the way they fit together if you turned them just right. [531]

The canyon echo in the jar hummed when she wasn’t looking, a low vibration that made the dust motes dance. [557]
She had learned to listen for it, to let its quiet inspiration guide her fingers as she sorted. [579]
One evening, as the truth unraveled around her like a spool of thread, she realized the buttons weren’t just lost—they were waiting. [611]
Waiting for her to piece them back into something whole. [627]

The last button was silver, tarnished but still bright at the edges, as if it had been polished by someone’s thumb over and over. [660]
It fit into the palm of her hand like it had always belonged there. [679]
When she slotted it into the final gap in her catalog, the hourglass in the corner shuddered. [704]
The sand inside began to flow upward. [715]

Mira didn’t gasp. [719]
She didn’t even smile. [724]
She simply turned the hourglass over again, watching as the sand resumed its downward fall, slower now, as if time itself had taken a breath. [762]
The canyon echo in the jar let out a single, soft note—shared wisdom, passed from one keeper to the next. [791]
And in the unearthed silence of the amber warehouse, she understood: prophecies weren’t meant to be fulfilled. [817]
They were meant to be spun into something new. [829]
[831]
