The glass atrium hummed with the quiet song of the brook beyond its panes, a sound that usually soothed Elias Veyne, dueling philosopher with a mechanical arm. [19]
Today, it did nothing to calm the storm in his chest. [28]
Across the atrium, his opponent, Lady Isolde Marr, stood with her back to him, adjusting the angles of a half-painted sundial with the precision of a surgeon. [54]
She had challenged him not to a duel of blades, but of wits—one where the first to land a fatal question would win. [78]
Elias flexed his brass fingers, the gears in his forearm whirring softly, a reminder of the last duel that had left him with this prosthetic and a reputation for being diplomatically fierce. [112]

Isolde turned, her dark eyes glinting. "You’re stalling, Veyne." [121]
"Not at all," he replied, stepping forward. "I’m merely admiring your choice of battlefield. A glass atrium beside a quiet brook—hardly the setting for dignified chaos." [152]
She smirked. "Chaos is where truth hides." [159]
Elias reached into his coat and withdrew a danish tin sewing needle card, its surface etched with intricate patterns. [179]
Isolde’s smirk faltered. "What is that?" [185]
"A map," he said, flipping it open to reveal a grid of tiny perforations. "Or rather, a cipher. Each hole aligns with the coded angles of your sundial, if you know how to read them." [222]
Her fingers twitched toward the sundial. "You’re cheating." [228]
"Am I?" Elias tilted his head. "Or am I turning questions into destinations?" [240]
Isolde’s gaze flicked between the needle card and the sundial, her expression unreadable. [254]

The atrium’s glass walls amplified the brook’s murmur, a sound that now felt like a countdown. [271]
Elias had spent years waiting for this moment—not for victory, but for the hidden overture beneath the duel. [290]
Isolde had always been more than an opponent; she was the architect of his most pivotal questions. [308]
And today, he would fence with her not just for answers, but for the chance to rewrite the rules entirely. [334]

She lunged first, not with a blade, but with a question: "Why do you assume the sundial’s angles are meant to be read?" [357]
Elias parried with one of his own: "Why do you assume they’re not?" [368]
The needle card trembled in his grip as he aligned it with the sundial’s shadow, the perforations casting a constellation of light onto the atrium’s floor. [395]
Isolde’s breath hitched. "You’ve been studying me." [403]
"As you’ve studied me," he countered. "The mechanical arm wasn’t just a replacement—it was an improvement. A question you never asked." [432]

The coded angles of the sundial shifted with the sun’s slow crawl, the half-painted gnomon splitting the light into jagged patterns. [458]
Elias traced a finger along the needle card’s edge, where the holes formed a path. "You see, Isolde, every duel is a conversation. And every conversation is a journey." [491]
She stepped closer, her voice low. "Then where does this one lead?" [504]
He met her gaze. "To the place where questions become destinations." [515]

The atrium’s glass walls seemed to dissolve, the brook’s murmur swelling into a roar as the needle card’s light mapped a route across the floor. [541]
Isolde’s fingers brushed the sundial, adjusting its angle by a fraction. "You’re not just a philosopher, Veyne. You’re a cartographer." [569]
"And you," he said, "are the territory." [576]

For a moment, neither moved. [583]
Then Isolde exhaled, a sound like surrender. "Fine. But if we’re turning questions into destinations, I get to choose the first one." [614]
Elias nodded, the mechanical arm whirring as he extended the needle card toward her. "Ask." [631]

She took it, her fingers lingering on the tin’s edge. "Why did you really accept this duel?" [648]
The atrium’s light shifted, the sundial’s shadow stretching long and thin. [661]
Elias smiled. "Because some overtures are hidden in plain sight. And I’ve been waiting for you to hear them." [692]

The brook’s quiet song filled the silence between them, a melody neither had noticed until now. [714]
Isolde turned the needle card over, tracing the perforations with her thumb. "Then let’s see where this leads." [733]
Elias watched as she aligned the card with the sundial once more, the coded angles weaving a new pattern. [755]
The duel was over. [759]
The journey had just begun. [764]
