The laboratory of lost sounds was a place where time folded in on itself, a cavernous space lined with rusted phonographs and glass jars humming with forgotten melodies. [23]
Inside, Elias Veyra traced the constellations inked across his knuckles, each star a map of a voice he had silenced. [46]
He was a constellation tattooist, not by trade, but by necessity—every prick of his needle stitched the sky into skin, a permanent ledger of the sounds he could no longer bear to hear. [83]

The amber piece sat on his workbench, warm despite the laboratory’s perpetual chill. [98]
Trapped inside was a mosquito, its wings still spread as if mid-flight, though it had been dead for centuries. [124]
Elias had found it in the hollow leg of an antique desk, nestled among handwritten letters yellowed with age. [146]
The letters spoke of a man who had built machines to tether the past to the present, to keep the dead from slipping away entirely. [175]
Elias knew that man’s guilt—it echoed in his own bones. [188]

The laboratory’s firmware was haunted, not by ghosts, but by the voices of those who had been erased. [212]
A child’s cry warbled from a speaker, then another, until the air vibrated with the dissonance of old guilt. [238]
Elias’s hands shook as he adjusted the translator, a device he had jury-rigged to interpret baby cries into something comprehensible. [265]
The machine spat out a single phrase, over and over: *"You left us behind."* [283]

He had left them behind. [287]
Not by choice, but by cowardice—his sister’s infant, wailing in the backseat as the car plunged into the river. [314]
Elias had survived; the baby had not. [323]
The letters in the desk had been his sister’s, unsent drafts to a brother who had vanished the night of the accident. [349]
She had written them in the months after, each word a tether to a man who no longer existed. [370]

The amber glowed faintly in the dim light. [378]
Elias pressed it to his chest, as if it could absorb the weight of his silence. [395]
The mosquito inside was motionless, but its wings seemed to hum with the same frequency as the cries in the laboratory. [425]
He wondered if it, too, was a relic of something left unfinished. [443]

The firmware flickered, its screens displaying static that resolved into faces—his sister’s, then the baby’s, then his own, older, hollow-eyed. [478]
The machine had learned to mimic them, to twist their voices into a chorus of accusation. [499]
Elias had built it to hush the dissonance, but it had only amplified it. [519]

He picked up his tattoo gun, the needle trembling. [529]
The ink was mixed with crushed amber, the mosquito’s essence suspended in the liquid. [550]
If he could stitch the past into his skin, maybe the cries would stop. [569]
Maybe the guilt would finally settle. [577]

The first mark burned. [580]
The constellation of Orion’s Belt, for the night he had failed to save them. [598]
The second, the Big Dipper, for the years he had spent running. [615]
The third, a single star, for the baby’s cry, now translated into a whisper: *"Stay."* [638]

The laboratory fell silent. [642]
The firmware dimmed, its screens going dark. [653]
Elias exhaled, the meteor hush of the room settling over him like snow. [672]
The amber was cold now, the mosquito’s wings still. [686]

He had tethered himself to the past, but for the first time, it did not pull. [708]
The letters in the desk were no longer unsent—they were written in his skin. [727]
The cries had quieted, not because they were gone, but because he had finally listened. [750]

Elias set down the tattoo gun. [756]
The laboratory was still haunted, but the ghosts were softer now, their voices a murmur instead of a scream. [781]
He picked up the amber, turning it in his fingers. [794]
The mosquito’s wings caught the light, and for a moment, they seemed to flutter. [814]
Then, silence. [817]
