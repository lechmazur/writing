The city of Veyth sprawled like a living sketch, its rooftops a labyrinth of canals that glinted under the pale moon. [16]
Liora Veyne balanced on the edge of a narrow bridge, her boots scuffing against the damp stone, the infinity symbol pendant at her throat catching the light like a silent promise. [44]
She was a natural history illustrator, though not by trade—her work was for the unseen, the forgotten, the things that slipped between the cracks of time. [74]
Tonight, she had come to uncage something far older than the city itself. [89]

The air hummed with an interrupted cadence, a rhythm just shy of completion, like a song cut off mid-note. [113]
Liora had spent years tracing its source, following the echoes that slithered through the canals, whispering of a place where time bent like wet paper. [144]
She believed—no, she *knew*—that somewhere in this rooftop maze, there was a door. [163]
Not a physical one, but a threshold where echoes were born, where the past and future blurred into a single, breathless instant. [189]

Her fingers brushed the infinity pendant, its cool metal a reminder of what she sought: a way to sculpt time itself. [214]
The legends spoke of the Giant’s Nap, a span of slumber so deep it warped the hours around it. [234]
If she could borrow time from the edges of that sleep, she might slip through the cracks and find what she’d been chasing. [259]

A gust of wind sent ripples across the canal, and Liora steadied herself, her breath shallow. [278]
The water below was black, but not still—it moved in slow, deliberate spirals, as if something beneath the surface was stirring. [308]
She knelt, pressing her palm to the stone, and felt the faintest vibration, like a heartbeat. [331]
The city’s pulse. [334]

Then she heard it: a whisper, not from the wind, but from the water itself. [351]
*"You’re late."* [354]
Liora spun, her heart hammering, but the bridge was empty. [367]
The voice had come from everywhere and nowhere, a thread of sound woven into the interrupted cadence. [390]

She exhaled, forcing her hands to steady. [398]
If she was going to do this, she had to move now. [410]
The pendant grew warm against her skin, as if responding to her resolve. [427]
She stepped onto the next bridge, then the next, following the canals deeper into the heart of the rooftop system, where the towers leaned like sentinels. [460]

The whispers grew louder, more insistent. [467]
*"Borrow time,"* they murmured, *"before the Giant wakes."* [480]
Liora clenched her jaw. [484]
She had studied the old texts, the fragments of lore that spoke of the Nap’s edges—moments where time pooled like water in a cupped hand. [517]
If she could dip into those pools, she might stretch a single second into an eternity. [540]

Ahead, the canal split, one path leading upward, the other spiraling down into darkness. [560]
Liora hesitated. [562]
The upward route felt too easy, too exposed. [569]
The downward one… that was where the echoes thickened, where the cadence faltered. [591]

She took the spiral. [595]
The air grew colder, heavier, as if the weight of time itself was pressing down on her. [621]
The pendant burned now, searing against her collarbone. [634]
She gasped, but didn’t stop. [639]

At the bottom, the canal opened into a vast, circular chamber, its walls lined with carvings of eyes—hundreds of them, all watching. [670]
In the center stood a pedestal, and on it, a single hourglass, its sand frozen mid-fall. [692]
Liora’s breath caught. [696]

This was it. [699]
The place where echoes were born. [706]
The hourglass was the key—if she could turn it, even for a moment, she might borrow time from the Giant’s Nap and step through. [737]

She reached out, her fingers trembling. [745]
The sand shivered at her touch, then began to flow, just a grain at first, then a trickle. [767]
The chamber groaned, the walls pulsing like a living thing. [780]
Liora didn’t hesitate. [784]
She uncaged the moment, and time bent around her. [797]

The world dissolved into light. [802]
