The blind mapmaker had never seen the ultrasonic forest, but she knew its hum in her bones. [14]
Her name was Liora, and the trees sang in frequencies too high for most ears, their leaves trembling like the strings of an untuned violin. [38]
She traced the bark with fingertips that absorbed languages through skin, though the forest spoke in vibrations, not words. [63]
The platinum compass ring on her thumb had been her father’s, passed down through generations of cartographers who charted not lands, but the spaces between hearts. [93]

Liora had come to dowse for the hidden stillpoint—a place where the forest’s song stilled, where the air thickened like honey. [119]
The legends said it was the center of all uncharted emotional depths, the one place where a person could stand and finally understand themselves. [148]
She followed a trail of musical notes, each one a faint chime in the dark, leading her deeper into the woods. [171]
The notes were not heard but felt, resonating in the hollow of her chest like a second heartbeat. [193]

The constellations shifted overhead, their pause marking the passage of time in slow, deliberate breaths. [216]
Liora had been walking for what felt like years, though the stars told her it had only been a night. [238]
The compass ring grew warm against her skin, its needle spinning wildly before settling on a direction she had not yet taken. [262]
She trusted it more than her own senses, for it had never led her astray. [279]

The forest thinned, the trees parting like curtains to reveal a clearing where the air hummed at a frequency just below pain. [308]
At its center stood a single tree, its bark smooth as glass, its branches motionless. [329]
This was the stillpoint. [332]
Liora stepped forward, her breath shallow, her pulse loud in her ears. [348]

The ground beneath her feet vibrated with a melody she had been chasing her whole life. [364]
It was the song of her grief, her longing, her quiet rage—all the things she had never been able to name. [390]
The notes coiled around her, seeping into her skin, and for the first time, she understood. [412]
The languages she absorbed were not just words, but emotions, and here, in this place, they finally made sense. [439]

She reached out, pressing her palm to the tree’s trunk. [452]
The bark pulsed like a living thing, and the melody swelled, filling the clearing with a sound that was almost visible. [478]
Liora closed her eyes—though it made no difference—and let the music guide her. [498]
She had spent her life navigating the unknown, but this was different. [514]
This was not about maps or compasses or trails of notes. [527]
This was about standing still and letting the world tell her its secrets. [545]

The stillpoint absorbed her, not unkindly, but with the weight of something ancient and patient. [566]
She felt her edges blur, her fears unravel, her questions dissolve into the hum of the forest. [590]
The platinum ring on her thumb grew cold, its needle pointing inward, toward her own heart. [612]
She laughed, the sound bright against the quiet blaze of the clearing. [629]

When she stepped back, the melody lingered, but the forest had already begun to shift. [650]
The constellations paused once more, as if holding their breath, before resuming their slow dance across the sky. [677]
Liora knew she would never find the stillpoint again, not in the same way. [698]
But she carried its song within her now, a map of her own making. [716]

She turned, the trail of notes fading behind her, and walked back into the ultrasonic dark. [736]
The forest sang louder than before, as if it, too, had learned something new. [754]
Liora smiled, her fingers brushing the compass ring. [765]
She had come to navigate uncharted emotional depths, but she had found something far greater: a home in the silence between the notes. [798]
