The resonance chamber hummed with the quiet pulse of forgotten melodies, its brass walls etched with the scars of time. [16]
Elias Veyne, the last music box repairman of the Hollow Quarter, knelt before a shattered mechanism, his fingers tracing the jagged edges of a broken gear. [45]
The air smelled of oil and old secrets, thick with the weight of something just beyond his understanding. [67]

His tools lay scattered across the workbench, each one worn smooth by decades of use. [85]
Among them glinted a single chip of crimson glass, no larger than a fingernail, humming faintly as if alive. [108]
Elias had found it lodged in the heart of a music box brought in by a weeping woman, its melody a dirge for a love lost to the dark. [137]
He knew, without knowing how, that it was a fragment of the Philosopher’s Stone—something that shouldn’t exist in this world of rust and ruin. [166]

The chamber’s walls vibrated in response to the chip’s presence, a low thrum that made his teeth ache. [188]
Elias had spent his life mending what wasn’t torn—restoring music boxes that played perfectly, their owners blind to the fractures in their own souls. [218]
But this was different. [222]
This was a covenant of rust, a pact between decay and creation, and it demanded something of him. [244]

A voice, thin as a reed, whispered from the shadows: *"You feel it, don’t you?"* [262]
Elias turned to see an old man leaning against the doorway, his cloak woven from patches of twilight. [284]
The stranger’s eyes were hollow, yet they burned with a light that made Elias’s chest tighten. [306]
*"Midnight stole the light from the world,"* the man said, *"and only those who tether themselves to the truth can reclaim it."* [332]

Elias’s hands trembled. [335]
He had always prided himself on his honesty, but the truth was, he had been wilting near dishonesty for years—ignoring the lies he told himself to keep going. [366]
The music boxes he repaired were just things, after all. [377]
But this chip, this covenant—it was more than that. [390]

The stranger stepped forward, his boots silent on the dusty floor. [404]
*"The balance is shifting,"* he murmured. *"The world is either falling or rising, and only those who mend the unseen can decide."* [432]
Elias swallowed. [434]
He had spent his life fixing what was broken, but what if the real work was mending what wasn’t torn—what if the fractures were inside him? [465]

The chip pulsed brighter, its glow casting long shadows across the chamber. [483]
Elias reached for it, his fingers brushing the crimson surface. [497]
A jolt of memory surged through him—a childhood spent in a workshop much like this one, his father’s hands guiding his own as they coaxed music from cold metal. [535]
But then the memory twisted, darkening, and he saw his father’s face contorted in grief, a music box clutched in his lifeless hands. [566]
*"You left me,"* the voice in his head accused. [576]

Elias recoiled, his breath coming in ragged gasps. [588]
The stranger watched him, unblinking. [595]
*"The light was stolen,"* he repeated, *"and only those who tether themselves to the truth can bring it back."* [623]
Elias understood then. [627]
The music boxes weren’t just machines—they were echoes of souls, and the chip was a key to something far greater. [655]

He picked up his tools, his hands steady now. [667]
The covenant of rust was not just a force—it was a choice. [683]
He could keep mending what wasn’t torn, or he could face the fractures within himself and reclaim the light. [712]

The resonance chamber trembled as he slotted the chip into the broken music box. [731]
The gears turned, not smoothly, but with purpose, and a melody rose—one that had been silent for centuries. [758]
Elias closed his eyes and let it fill him. [769]

The stranger smiled, his hollow eyes now bright. [781]
*"The balance is restored,"* he said, and then he was gone. [796]

Elias opened his eyes to find the chamber bathed in golden light. [811]
The music box played on, its melody a tinkersong of wonder, and for the first time in years, he felt whole. [839]
