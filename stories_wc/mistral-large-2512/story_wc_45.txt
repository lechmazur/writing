The garden had always been there, hidden behind the hedge maze that no one bothered to solve anymore. [14]
Lena found it by accident, or perhaps by design—she had never been sure which. [29]
She was a forgiving skeptic, the kind who doubted the sky was blue until she saw it for herself, yet still believed in second chances. [56]
That’s why, after the substitute body was found in the river, she didn’t run. [73]
She stayed, because the tooth in her pocket demanded it. [83]

It was small, that tooth, a changeling’s baby tooth—so the old stories said. [98]
Lena had found it years ago, wedged between the roots of an apple tree in the garden, its edges still sharp with the memory of a child’s bite. [126]
She kept it not for luck, but for proof, though proof of what, she couldn’t say. [143]
The garden itself was a cleft in certainty, a place where the rules of the world bent like willow branches. [164]
Here, the air smelled of damp earth and something older, something that made her skin prickle with the shrewdly innocent question: *What if?* [188]

She yearned for answers, but not the kind that could be written down. [202]
The kind that lived in the spaces between breaths, in the way the garden’s flowers bloomed in colors no one had names for. [225]
The substitute body had been a shock, but not a surprise. [236]
The town had always whispered about the child who wasn’t quite right, the one who vanished one night, leaving behind only a hollow in the bedsheets. [263]
Lena had seen the body, pale and bloated, and known it wasn’t the real one. [280]
The real one was still out there, somewhere in the maze or beyond it. [296]

That’s why she came back to the garden, to the place where the bone-setting rituals of the old world still held power. [320]
The hedges here were thick with thorns, but she knew the path by heart. [337]
She knelt beside the apple tree, pressing her fingers into the soil until they brushed against something smooth. [358]
Another tooth. [361]
This one was larger, older, and when she held it to the light, it glowed faintly, like a star trapped in enamel. [387]

Her motivation was simple: to turn mistakes into constellations. [400]
The town’s fear had festered for too long, a wound that needed setting. [417]
If the changeling was still alive, it deserved to be found. [430]
If it was gone, then the stories deserved to be laid to rest. [444]
She placed the teeth side by side on a flat stone, whispering words she didn’t understand but felt in her bones. [468]

The garden responded. [471]
The flowers trembled, and the air hummed with a sound like a lullaby half-remembered. [492]
Lena closed her eyes, letting the nostalgia of it wash over her—not for what was lost, but for what could still be made new. [522]
When she opened them again, the teeth were gone. [533]
In their place was a map, drawn in lines of silver that pulsed like veins. [551]

She followed it without hesitation. [557]
The maze unfolded before her, its paths shifting like living things. [573]
At its center stood a child, small and pale, with eyes like polished river stones. [591]
It was the changeling, or what remained of it. [602]
It looked at her and smiled, a smile too old for its face. [616]

“You found me,” it said. [621]
Lena knelt, her heart pounding. [627]
“Why did you leave?” she asked. [632]
The child held out its hand, and in its palm lay a third tooth, this one glowing like a tiny sun. [656]
“Because they didn’t know how to keep me,” it said. [668]
“But you do.” [672]

She understood then. [676]
The garden had been waiting for someone who could see beyond the fear, who could forgive the strangeness and embrace it. [704]
The bone-setting wasn’t just about healing; it was about making whole what had been broken. [726]
She took the tooth, and the child’s fingers curled around hers, warm and real. [744]

Together, they walked back through the maze, the garden sighing around them like a held breath finally released. [768]
The town would never know the truth, not all of it. [780]
But that was alright. [784]
Some constellations were meant to be seen only by those who knew where to look. [806]
And Lena, the forgiving skeptic, had always been good at finding things. [823]
