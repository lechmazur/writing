The garden gate creaked shut behind Elias as the last lantern of the hedge maze flickered out, leaving only the silvered glow of the moon through the twisted branches. [23]
He had waited all evening for the tourists to leave, for the laughter and chatter to dissolve into the night, because only then could he step into the orchard without fear of being seen. [56]
The mystic orchard garden was his sanctuary, a place where the air hummed with the scent of ripe apples and something older, something that tasted like lightning on his tongue. [91]
Elias was synesthetically blessed—or cursed, depending on the day—meaning every sound carried color, every touch left a lingering flavor, and every emotion painted itself across his vision in swirling hues. [129]
Tonight, the garden pulsed with deep violets and burnt oranges, the colors of nostalgia, of memories half-remembered and futures just out of reach. [157]

He wasn’t alone. [160]
The stage ghost of the old theater at the maze’s edge had followed him, as it always did after the business closed. [183]
Its name was Liora, though no one living knew that anymore. [195]
She had been a dancer once, a star of the silent era, her performances so electric they left audiences breathless. [219]
Now, she was a whisper of silk and shadow, a flicker of movement in the corner of the eye, forever seeking an encore that would never come. [248]
Elias had first seen her when he was a child, hiding in the maze after hours, and she had been his secret ever since. [272]

“You’re late,” Liora murmured, her voice like wind through dry leaves. [284]
Elias reached into his coat pocket and pulled out the hand-painted tarot coin, its edges worn smooth by years of handling. [312]
The coin was his most treasured possession, given to him by his grandmother, who had claimed it could “call what isn’t yet.” [340]
The front bore the image of The Fool, stepping blindly into the unknown; the back, The World, complete and endless. [365]
Liora’s eyes—once a vibrant green, now a faded echo—fixed on it. [380]
“You still believe in that thing?” she asked, though her fingers twitched toward it. [396]

Elias didn’t answer. [400]
Instead, he knelt in the damp grass and pressed the coin into the earth, spinning it with his thumb. [424]
The garden seemed to hold its breath. [432]
Then, the coin stilled, and the world fractured. [444]
Not in the way of broken glass, but like a reflection in a pond disturbed by a thrown stone—ripples spreading outward, warping time itself. [476]
Liora gasped as the orchard around them flickered, the trees shifting between seasons in the span of a heartbeat. [504]
Summer’s golden fruit, autumn’s crimson leaves, winter’s skeletal branches—all overlapping, all true. [524]

“What did you do?” Liora whispered, her voice trembling. [535]
Elias stood, brushing dirt from his knees. [543]
“I’m intertwining the moments,” he said. [552]
“Not just the past and present, but the *possible*.” [563]
The garden responded, producing echoes—not of sound, but of *potential*. [581]
A version of Liora, younger and full of fire, danced between the trees, her laughter ringing like bells. [606]
Another Elias, older and weary, sat on a bench, watching her with sad eyes. [625]
A third, a child, ran through the maze, giggling as Liora’s ghostly hands tickled the air around him. [653]

Liora reached out, her fingers passing through her younger self’s shoulder. [670]
“This is cruel,” she said, but her voice lacked conviction. [681]
Elias shook his head. [686]
“No. It’s *hope*.” [693]
The fractured timeline was a fragile thing, a web of might-have-beens and could-still-bes. [715]
He had spent years studying the garden, learning how its magic worked, how it fed on longing and memory. [740]
And Liora’s longing was the deepest of all. [751]

“You want an encore,” Elias said softly. [760]
“You want to dance again.” [768]
Liora’s form flickered, her edges blurring like candle flame. [781]
“It’s impossible,” she said, but the words were less certain now. [796]
Elias held out his hand. [801]
“Not here. Not like this.” [808]
The garden pulsed around them, the echoes growing louder, more insistent. [823]
Liora hesitated, then took his hand. [830]
