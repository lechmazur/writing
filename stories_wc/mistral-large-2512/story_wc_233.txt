The queen had not slept in three nights, not since the dreams began bleeding starlight into her waking hours. [16]
Her chambers, once gilded with the quiet authority of a ruler untouched by doubt, now felt like a cage of silk and shadow. [38]
She traced the jagged constellations etched into her skin—thin, luminous lines that pulsed faintly, as if the cosmos had sewn itself into her flesh. [73]
The court physicians whispered of celestial curses; the priests murmured of divine judgment. [87]
But the queen knew better. [92]
This was no punishment. [96]
It was an invitation. [100]

She stood at the edge of the palace’s highest balcony, the wind tugging at her robes like a restless child. [123]
Below, the city sprawled in obedient silence, its lanterns flickering like dying embers. [139]
The final warning had come at dawn—a raven with eyes like polished obsidian, bearing a scroll sealed in wax the color of old blood. [167]
*"The grotto hungers,"* it had read. [173]
No signature, no seal of origin. [179]
Only the weight of inevitability. [183]

The queen exhaled, her breath curling into the twilight. [194]
She had spent a lifetime issuing decrees, her voice softly commanding, her words weaving fate like thread through fabric. [220]
But this—this was different. [224]
This was a climb she had to make alone. [235]

The path to the ridge was treacherous, a serpentine trail carved into the mountainside. [251]
The air thinned as she ascended, the world below shrinking into a tapestry of twinkling lights. [271]
By the time she reached the ember grotto, the first fireflies of summer were rising from the valleys, their glow a fragile counterpoint to the grotto’s eerie luminescence. [306]
She paused, watching as one of the tiny creatures alighted on her wrist, its light pulsing in time with the constellations on her skin. [337]
A shared exhale—hers, the firefly’s, the mountain’s—before it darted away, leaving a trail of gold in its wake. [362]

The grotto yawned before her, its walls slick with cobalt moss that shimmered like the underside of a wave. [385]
The air smelled of ozone and something older, something that hummed in the back of her throat. [407]
She stepped inside, her boots sinking into the damp earth. [420]
The deeper she went, the brighter the walls became, until the grotto was a cathedral of light, its ceiling a swirling void of stars. [450]
And there, at the heart of it all, was the source of her dreams. [464]

A mirror. [466]
Not of glass, but of liquid silver, its surface rippling like water disturbed by a breath. [490]
The queen approached, her reflection wavering—no, not her reflection. [505]
A woman with her face, but older, her eyes filled with the same starlight that now bled from the queen’s own skin. [534]
*"You’ve come,"* the woman said, her voice like wind through reeds. [548]
*"I’ve been waiting."* [553]

The queen’s pulse quickened. [558]
*"Who are you?"* [562]
The woman smiled, and the grotto trembled. [572]
*"The last queen of the sky."* [580]
*"And you are the first of the earth to remember."* [592]

The dreams had not been warnings. [598]
They had been memories. [602]
Fragments of a time when the sky and the earth were not so far apart, when the stars still bled into the world below. [632]
The final warning had not been a threat. [641]
It had been a summons. [645]

The queen reached out, her fingers brushing the mirror’s surface. [660]
The silver parted like mist, and for a moment, she was weightless, suspended between two worlds. [685]
Then the grotto exhaled, and the stars bled brighter. [698]
The climb had not been the end. [705]
It had been the beginning. [710]

Outside, the fireflies rose higher, their light weaving through the cobalt dark like stitches in the fabric of the night. [738]
The queen stepped back, her skin no longer marked by constellations, but by something deeper, something that hummed in her bones. [768]
She turned toward the mouth of the grotto, where the first hints of dawn were creeping over the ridge. [795]
The city below would wake soon. [801]
And she would be there to meet them—not as a queen disenchanted, but as one reborn. [824]
