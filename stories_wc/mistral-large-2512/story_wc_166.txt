The twilight garden hummed with the quiet song of the sea, its salt-laced breeze curling through the overgrown vines like a lover’s whisper. [18]
Liora, the last tide dancer of the Eastern Spires, stood barefoot on the moss-slick stones, her toes curling against the cool damp as if testing the earth’s pulse. [48]
She had chosen this elective exile—not for shame, nor for sorrow, but because the world had forgotten how to listen to the tides, and she refused to dance for deaf ears. [88]

The moonstone cabochon dust speck rested in the hollow of her collarbone, a relic from the days when her people still carved the heavens into jewelry. [122]
It had been a gift from her mother, who had pressed it into her palm the night before the nostalgia ban, when all remembrance of the old ways was outlawed. [154]
"Keep it hidden," her mother had murmured, "but never still." [166]
Liora had obeyed, rolling the speck between her fingers during storms, letting its faint glow guide her through the darkest tides. [191]

Now, it pulsed against her skin, spontaneously anchored to her heartbeat, as if the moon itself had claimed her. [215]
She exhaled, watching the gaps between the stars—the places where the light had not yet reached, where the void stretched thin enough to hear the cosmos breathing. [248]
That was how she had learned to fledge: not by leaping, but by observing the spaces between, where the wind held its breath before the dive. [277]

A rustle in the undergrowth made her turn. [284]
A man emerged from the shadows, his skin inked with constellations that shifted when he moved, as if the night sky had been pressed into his flesh. [318]
"You’re the one they call the tide dancer," he said, his voice rough as barnacle-encrusted rope. [338]
Liora tilted her head. "And you’re the one who writes the sky onto skin." [352]
He smiled, slow and sharp as a blade unsheathed. "I am. And I’ve come to ask you to be my next verse." [378]

She should have refused. [383]
The nostalgia ban had made poets of the flesh into criminals, and the last one caught had been skinned alive, his tattoos nailed to the city gates like warnings. [420]
But the moonstone speck burned hotter, and the gaps between the stars seemed to widen, whispering. [444]
Liora had spent years dancing the tides in silence; perhaps it was time to let the silence dance back. [469]

"Where?" she asked. [472]
"Here," he said, gesturing to the twilight garden, where the last light of dusk bled into the first stars. [498]
He knelt, rolling up his sleeves to reveal the blank canvas of his inner arms. "I want the sea written into me. Not as it is now, but as it was before the ban—when the tides still sang." [543]

Liora hesitated. [546]
The nostalgia ban had not just forbidden memory; it had rewritten it, erasing the old songs, the old names, the old ways of seeing. [580]
But the moonstone speck was warm against her skin, and the gaps between the stars pulsed like a second heartbeat. [607]
She knelt beside him, pressing her palm to his wrist. [619]
The ink would be made from crushed pearl, from the salt of her tears, from the dust of the moonstone—things the ban had declared contraband. [650]

"Close your eyes," she murmured. [657]
He obeyed, and she began to dance—not with her feet, but with her fingers, tracing the tides onto his skin as if she were pulling them from the gaps in the sky. [693]
The ink took on a life of its own, curling into waves, into whirlpools, into the faces of drowned gods. [722]
The man gasped, but did not pull away. [730]

When she finished, the garden was dark, the stars sharp as shattered glass. [748]
The man looked at his arms, where the sea now lived in ink, and laughed—a sound like breaking waves. [772]
"You’ve made me a criminal twice over," he said. [784]
Liora smiled, the moonstone speck finally still against her skin. [799]
"Then we’ll be exiles together," she said. [811]
The wind picked up, carrying the scent of salt and distant storms, and for the first time in years, she did not feel alone. [830]
