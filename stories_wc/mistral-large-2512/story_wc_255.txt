The glassblower’s courtyard smelled of molten silica and damp earth, a scent Elias had come to associate with failed attempts. [17]
He dipped his brush into the cobalt pigment, then paused—his eyes, useless for distinguishing hues, relied on touch and memory. [38]
The canvas before him was a mess of overlapping strokes, each one a negotiation between what he saw and what he felt. [64]
Across the courtyard, the glassblower, Mara, shaped a vase with deft hands, her breath steady as she coaxed the glass into delicate curves. [93]
Elias envied her certainty. [96]

A rustle came from the corner where Mara’s overgrown jasmine tangled with a trellis. [115]
Elias turned, expecting a stray cat, but instead found a woman crouched among the leaves, her fingers tracing the veins of a wilting rose. [143]
She wore a dress stitched from mismatched scraps, and when she looked up, her eyes held the sharp glint of someone who knew too much for her age. [173]
“You’re the painter,” she said, not a question. [180]
Elias nodded, though he couldn’t see her clearly. [188]
“I’m Liora. I trade in awakenings.” [196]

He frowned. [198]
“Awakenings?” [200]
Liora plucked a reed from her pocket—thin, flexible, the kind used in concertina bellows. [218]
She pressed it to her lips and blew, a sound like a sigh escaping a sleeping mouth. [235]
The jasmine trembled. [238]
Petals that had been curled in on themselves unfurled, their edges tinged with a violet Elias had never seen before. [263]
“Bartered awakenings,” she said. “I wake what’s dormant. For a price.” [279]

Elias’s pulse quickened. [283]
He had spent years trying to capture the exact shade of twilight, the way it bled into indigo before surrendering to black. [314]
His colorblindness had always been a wall, but what if it wasn’t a flaw? [329]
What if it was a different kind of sight? [338]
“What do you want in return?” he asked. [346]

Liora’s grin was innocently cunning, the kind that made you trust her right before you realized you shouldn’t. [367]
“A painting,” she said. “Not of what you see. Of what you *feel*.” [384]
Elias hesitated. [386]
His work had always been about precision, about forcing his hands to obey where his eyes failed. [414]
But the jasmine’s new color haunted him. [423]

That night, he arranged the courtyard’s potted plants in a spiral, their leaves overlapping like the scales of a rising creature. [449]
Mara found him at dawn, her arms crossed. [458]
“You’re communicating with someone,” she said. [466]
Elias didn’t deny it. [470]
He showed her the half-finished canvas—a swirl of grays and blacks, the texture of storm clouds. [493]
“It’s not about the colors,” he said. “It’s about the weight of them.” [512]

Mara’s expression softened. [516]
She reached into her apron and pulled out a shard of glass, its edges still warm from the kiln. [538]
“This is the color of the phoenix’s first flight,” she said. [552]
“After it rises, the world looks different. Sharper.” [564]
Elias took the shard, turning it in his fingers. [574]
The light caught it, throwing a spectrum he couldn’t name across his palm. [592]

Liora returned at dusk, her concertina reed tucked into her belt. [607]
She studied the painting, then the glass shard, then Elias. [620]
“You’re learning,” she said. [624]
He nodded. [626]
The jasmine had withered again, but its scent lingered, sweeter now. [643]

“What’s next?” he asked. [650]
Liora plucked a dead leaf from the trellis and crushed it between her fingers. [668]
“Find beauty in the cracks,” she said. [677]
“That’s where the light gets in.” [685]

Elias picked up his brush. [690]
For the first time, he didn’t fear the blank canvas. [702]
He saw it as it was: imperfect, waiting. [711]

The glassblower’s courtyard hummed with possibility. [720]
Mara blew a new shape into the air, a helix of gold and crimson. [736]
Liora played a note on her reed, and the plants sighed in response. [752]
Elias dipped his brush into the cobalt again, but this time, he didn’t hesitate. [772]
He painted the color of awakening. [781]
