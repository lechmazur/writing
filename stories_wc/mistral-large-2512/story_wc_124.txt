The greenhouse smelled of damp earth and forgotten time, its glass panes fogged with the breath of plants long gone from the wild. [18]
Elias adjusted the wick of a flickering lantern, his fingers trembling not from the cold but from the weight of what he carried. [42]
As a lantern broker, he traded in light, yet tonight, he sought something darker—answers hidden in the scent of memory. [68]

The crystal perfume vial sat heavy in his pocket, its contents swirling like liquid twilight. [85]
He had found it in the attic of his childhood home, tucked between yellowed letters and a moth-eaten scarf. [108]
The moment he uncorked it, the aroma had struck him like a blow: bergamot and smoke, the exact scent of his father’s coat the last time he saw him. [137]
Now, Elias was aromatically cautious, flinching at the first hint of citrus or the acrid tang of burning wood. [159]

The greenhouse’s ultraviolet lamps hummed to life, casting eerie violet shadows across the withered leaves. [180]
As the transformation completed, the air thickened with the ghosts of blooms that no longer existed. [199]
Elias knelt beside a skeletal orchid, its petals brittle as old parchment, and wondered why some smells could unravel a man. [227]

He had come to grieve, though he wasn’t sure for whom—the father who left or the boy who never understood why. [250]
The vial’s scent had become a key, unlocking doors he’d boarded shut. [268]
In the ultraviolet glow, the orchid’s veins pulsed faintly, as if remembering the sun. [287]

A rustle made him turn. [293]
Between the ferns stood a woman in a tattered gardener’s apron, her eyes reflecting the same violet light. [318]
“You’re not supposed to be here after dark,” she said, her voice like dry leaves. [338]
Elias swallowed. “Neither are you.” [345]

She stepped closer, her boots crushing a fallen pod. [354]
“This place is for those who can’t let go,” she said. [367]
He clutched the vial. “I just want to know why some smells make me cry.” [385]

The woman plucked a dead leaf, rolling it between her fingers. [398]
“Because scent is the last sense to fade,” she murmured. [413]
“When the body forgets everything else, it remembers the smell of rain on hot pavement, or the way bread tasted in a kitchen you’ll never see again.” [452]

Elias’s throat tightened. [458]
The greenhouse seemed to shrink around him, the ultraviolet light exposing cracks in his resolve. [480]
“My father left when I was ten,” he said. [492]
“He wore a cologne that smelled like this.” He held up the vial. [510]

The woman didn’t look surprised. [517]
“Some plants die because they’re too delicate for this world,” she said. [536]
“Others because they were never meant to stay.” [550]

A tear slipped down Elias’s cheek, catching the light like a prism. [569]
The vial’s scent coiled around him, pulling him back to a porch swing, to laughter that ended too soon. [595]
He had spent years avoiding the past, only to find it waiting in the dark, preserved in glass. [622]

The woman placed a hand on his shoulder. [632]
“Grief isn’t something you fix,” she said. [642]
“It’s something you carry, like a lantern in the dark.” [658]

Elias exhaled, the weight in his chest shifting, not lighter, but more familiar. [678]
The ultraviolet light flickered, and for a moment, the greenhouse bloomed with colors that didn’t exist. [703]
He understood then—some memories weren’t meant to be solved, only held. [723]

The vial remained in his palm, its scent no longer a wound, but a whisper. [741]
Outside, the first hints of dawn crept through the glass, softening the crystal shadows. [762]
Elias stood, the lantern in his other hand steady at last. [778]

He would keep the vial. [783]
Not as a relic, but as a reminder. [792]
Some things could only be understood in the dark. [805]
[810]
