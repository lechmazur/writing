The raft city of Carnivale drifted on the swollen river like a dream half-remembered, its wooden planks groaning beneath the weight of perpetual revelry. [23]
Lan had spent her first twelve years here, weaving through the crowds of jugglers and fire-eaters, her fingers sticky with stolen candy floss. [48]
But now, at sixteen, she saw the cracks—the way the carnival’s laughter had started to sound hollow, the way the stalls selling handmade trinkets were being replaced by glossy kiosks hawking corporate-branded baubles. [90]
Gentrification was coming, and it wore a smile as bright as the neon signs flickering to life above the water. [116]

She was a culture shock absorber, though she didn’t know the term yet. [131]
Her mother had been born in the old country, her father in the industrial slums upriver, and Lan had inherited their knack for translating between worlds. [159]
She could slip from the raucous chaos of the carnival to the quiet precision of the raft’s hidden archives, where the elders kept records of every trade, every law, every betrayal. [192]
It was there she found the foundation stone chip—a sliver of the original cornerstone of Carnivale, broken off during a storm decades ago and preserved like a relic. [228]
The elders said it was a symbol of resilience, but Lan saw something else: a key. [245]

Her dual allegiance was a burden she carried like a second skin. [260]
To the carnival, she was one of them, a child of the raft, quick with a joke and quicker with a knife when drunks got handsy. [286]
To the outsiders—the investors circling like vultures, the bureaucrats promising "urban renewal"—she was a bridge, a girl who spoke their language and could be trusted to smooth the way. [324]
But trust was a currency she spent carefully. [337]

She was orderly intuitive, a paradox that made her both invaluable and dangerous. [352]
While others saw the carnival as a lawless bacchanal, Lan saw the patterns: the way the raft’s sections shifted with the tides, the way disputes were settled with coded insults and ritualized dances. [390]
She could reorganize chaos into something navigable, like rearranging the pieces of a puzzle to reveal the picture beneath. [419]
And that’s what she did now, her fingers tracing the edges of the foundation stone chip in her pocket. [444]

The messages came at night, when the carnival’s lights blurred into streaks of gold and crimson. [466]
Graffiti, but not the kind that marked territory or boasted of conquests. [482]
These were whispers in paint—symbols only the initiated would recognize, warnings and instructions scrawled on the undersides of bridges, on the backs of vendor carts, even on the hulls of the few remaining fishing boats. [522]
Lan had learned to read them like a second language, her heart pounding as she deciphered the latest: *They’re coming for the heart. Stop them.* [553]

The heart of Carnivale wasn’t a place, but a person: Old Man Vey, the last of the original raft-builders, who held the deeds to the floating land in his gnarled hands. [589]
The investors wanted those deeds, and they’d pay well—or force them, if necessary. [610]
Lan knew she had to act, but how? [619]
She couldn’t fight them head-on, not yet. [630]
But she could reorganize. [636]

She started small, slipping notes into the pockets of the carnival’s performers, urging them to "accidentally" block the paths of the surveyors. [666]
She convinced the cooks to serve the investors food that was just a little too spicy, just a little too slow. [690]
And she left her own graffiti, a counter-message: *The raft is ours. The river is ours. The heart stays.* [721]

The night before the privatization vote, Lan stood at the edge of the raft, the foundation stone chip pressed into her palm. [749]
She had done all she could, but the weight of dual allegiance still pressed on her chest. [772]
Then she saw it—a flicker of movement in the shadows. [787]
Old Man Vey, his face lined with years of sun and salt, stepped forward and placed a hand on her shoulder. [813]
"The raft survives because we choose it," he said. [827]
And for the first time, Lan believed it. [837]
