The mirror maker lived where the ruined orchard district began, where centuries of thick fog swallowed the last of the apple trees whole. [19]
His cottage stood firm on a patch of earth still stubbornly alive, though the rest of the land had long since surrendered to the mist. [43]
He was firmly grounded, they said—too practical for dreams, too rooted to wander. [57]
Yet every evening, upon the shimmer of twilight frost, he lit a single lantern and carried it outside, as if waiting for something to answer its glow. [89]

The astronomer’s broken sextant had been left on his doorstep three winters ago, its brass arms bent like the ribs of a dying bird. [119]
No note accompanied it, only a smudge of starlight on the lens, as if the sky itself had pressed its fingerprint there. [143]
The mirror maker had tried to mend it, but the gears were fused by time, the markings worn to ghosts. [164]
Still, he kept it on his workbench, beside the shards of glass he used to recreate the faces of those who had vanished into the fog. [191]

Tonight, the sextant hummed. [195]
Not with the whir of machinery, but with a breath—slow, deliberate, as if something were inhaling through its hollows. [221]
The mirror maker stilled, his own lungs syncing to the rhythm without thought. [235]
Through synchronized breathing, he felt the boundary between his skin and the air dissolve, just for a moment. [257]
The fog curled around his ankles, thicker than before, and in its depths, he saw a flicker: a runaway dream, bright as a comet’s tail, darting between the skeletal trees. [293]

He had spent his life shaping reflections, but never had he tried to capture one. [313]
Dreams were slippery things, they said—untouchable, unknowable. [326]
But the sextant’s pulse quickened, and the mirror maker understood: this was no ordinary dream. [346]
It had escaped from someone, or something, and now it wandered lost in the orchard’s ruins, too afraid to return. [371]

He reached for the broken instrument, his fingers brushing the cold metal. [388]
The fog responded, parting just enough to reveal a path of frost-kissed grass, leading deeper into the trees. [417]
The mirror maker stepped forward, his breath steady, his heart a metronome. [435]
Each exhale sent ripples through the mist, and each inhale drew the dream closer, its light pulsing like a heartbeat. [464]

At the center of the orchard stood a glass mountain, jagged and translucent, its peaks catching the last of the twilight. [490]
It hadn’t been there yesterday. [495]
The runaway dream hovered above it, a wisp of gold and blue, too afraid to descend. [518]
The mirror maker realized then that the mountain was made of forgotten things—shards of memories, fragments of wishes, all fused together by time and longing. [557]
To capture the dream, he would have to climb. [568]

He placed the sextant in his pocket, its weight a reminder of the boundary he was about to erase. [593]
With each step, the glass beneath his boots sang, a sound like wind through chimes. [615]
The higher he climbed, the thinner the air became, until his breath was all that anchored him to the world. [643]
Through synchronized breathing, he matched the dream’s rhythm, and slowly, it drifted toward him. [666]

At the summit, the dream settled into his palms, warm and trembling. [683]
It was not a thing to be caught, but a thing to be held—lightly, carefully, like a bird with a broken wing. [710]
The mirror maker understood then that erasing boundaries was not about possession, but about trust. [732]
The dream had run not from fear, but from loneliness. [745]

As he descended, the glass mountain dissolved into mist, leaving only the sextant in his pocket, whole once more. [770]
The fog receded, revealing the orchard’s bones—twisted branches, silvered by frost, reaching for the sky. [795]
The mirror maker smiled. [800]
