The last time Elias Veyne saw the sky, it was through the fractured dome of the Nexus, a lattice of iron and glass that had once been a marvel of engineering. [23]
Now, it was a cage. [26]
The starlight filtering through the cracks painted silver veins across the stone floor, but Elias barely noticed—his breath came in shallow gasps, his fingers digging into the cold metal of the scaffolding. [65]
Claustrophobia had always been his silent tormentor, a shadow that clung to him even in open spaces, but here, in the bowels of the Nexus, it was a living thing, squeezing his ribs until his vision blurred. [108]

He had come during the fallow period, when the city above slept and the Nexus was left to its ghosts. [131]
The air smelled of damp stone and old parchment, the scent of a place that had been forgotten by time. [152]
Elias adjusted the strap of his satchel, the weight of the blueprint drafting compass point pressing against his hip like a promise. [176]
It was an odd thing to carry—a slender, brass-tipped tool, its needle still sharp despite centuries of disuse—but it was the only clue he had. [205]

The key to the spatial mutiny was here, somewhere in the Nexus. [219]
Not a rebellion of people, but of *space itself*, a secret buried in the architecture of the old world. [240]
Elias had spent years piecing together fragments of journals, whispers of a time when the Nexus had been more than a ruin—when it had been a gateway. [272]
And if the legends were true, the key to unlocking it had been lost when the last of the architects vanished. [298]

A low hum vibrated through the stone, so faint he almost mistook it for the wind. [320]
Then it swelled, a deep, resonant note that made his teeth ache. [337]
The reverberation of a lonely church organ, though there were no churches in the Nexus—only echoes. [360]
Elias turned, his pulse quickening. [367]
The sound was coming from the central chamber, where the old blueprints had been found. [387]

He moved prudently adventurous, his steps light but deliberate, each footfall swallowed by the vastness of the space. [415]
The organ’s notes curled around him, pulling him deeper into the shadows. [434]
Then he saw it—a figure hunched over a drafting table, their back to him, fingers dancing over keys that shouldn’t have existed. [466]
The air around them shimmered, warping like heat off desert sand. [483]

Elias froze, transfixed. [486]
The figure was drawing not on paper, but on the *air itself*, the blueprint drafting compass point in their hand leaving trails of glowing ink. [519]
Lines spiraled outward, forming shapes that made his head throb—impossible geometries, angles that defied physics. [545]
This was the key. [549]

But before he could speak, the figure turned. [560]
Their face was a blur of shifting light, as if they were only half-present in this world. [580]
“You shouldn’t be here,” they said, their voice layered with echoes. [596]
Elias swallowed. [598]
“I need to know how to fix it.” [606]
The figure tilted their head. [612]
“The Nexus was never meant to be fixed. It was meant to *move*.” [634]

A gust of wind howled through the chamber, though no doors were open. [652]
The organ’s music crescendoed, and the ground beneath Elias’s feet trembled. [673]
The figure extended a hand, the compass point gleaming. [686]
“Take it,” they said. [691]
“But be warned—once you see the truth, you can’t unsee it.” [713]

Elias hesitated, then reached out. [721]
The moment his fingers closed around the compass, the world *shifted*. [736]
The Nexus wasn’t a ruin. [741]
It was a ship. [744]
A vessel of stone and iron, built to sail not across oceans, but across *dimensions*. [768]
And it was waking up. [773]

The figure smiled, their edges dissolving into the dark. [789]
“Now you understand,” they whispered. [797]
“Spatial mutiny isn’t rebellion. It’s *freedom*.” [812]

Elias clutched the compass, his breath ragged, his claustrophobia forgotten. [827]
The stars above weren’t just light. [834]
They were a map. [837]
