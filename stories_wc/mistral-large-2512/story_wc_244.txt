The disused railway station smelled of damp stone and old timetables, its arched windows choked with ivy that spilled like green waterfalls onto the cracked platform. [23]
Elias Voss adjusted his frayed cuffs and grinned at the pigeons pecking at the moss between the tracks, his desperately jocular manner a shield against the weight of his own solitude. [56]
He had come here not by train—those had stopped running decades ago—but by rumor, the kind that slithered through abandoned chat rooms and whispered in the static of pirate radio broadcasts. [90]
They said the station was a hub for something called the Reciprocity Exchange, a shadowy network where favors were traded like currency, and where the most elusive disaster-relief logistician in the world was said to appear at dusk. [134]

Elias had spent three years tracking down fragments of that rumor, each one more improbable than the last: a nurse in Minsk who swore she’d seen the logistician hand out morphine vials in exchange for a stranger’s childhood memory; a fisherman in Hokkaido who claimed the same figure had bartered a week’s worth of diesel for a single, heartfelt apology. [188]
The stories always ended the same way—with the logistician vanishing before the favor could be repaid, leaving behind only a slip of paper with a single word: *later*. [217]
Elias didn’t believe in magic, but he believed in patterns, and the pattern here was loneliness. [235]
The logistician didn’t just trade goods; they traded connection, stitching together the broken threads of strangers’ lives with the promise of reciprocity. [264]
And Elias needed that connection more than he needed air. [276]

The sun dipped below the station’s crumbling clock tower, painting the ivy in hues of rust and gold. [295]
Elias pulled the fragment of moon rock from his pocket, its jagged edge catching the light like a shard of frozen starlight. [320]
He had won it in a card game from a retired astronaut who’d sworn it was the only thing he’d ever stolen from NASA, and that it was cursed to bring its owner either great fortune or great ruin. [360]
Elias didn’t care about curses. [365]
He cared about the way the rock hummed faintly in his palm, as if it recognized the weight of his longing. [388]
If the rumors were true, the logistician would want this—something rare, something impossible to replace. [411]
And if Elias was lucky, they’d trade it for the one thing he couldn’t buy or steal: a cure for the hollow ache in his chest. [442]

A shadow detached itself from the station’s far wall, moving with the quiet precision of a man who had spent a lifetime slipping through disasters unnoticed. [472]
The logistician was smaller than Elias had imagined, their face obscured by a wide-brimmed hat, their hands gloved in fingerless wool. [499]
“You’re late,” they said, voice dry as old paper. [510]
“Trains don’t run on time here,” Elias replied, forcing a laugh. [525]
The logistician didn’t smile. [528]
“Most people bring food. Or medicine. Or a working generator.” [544]
Elias held out the moon rock. [550]
“I bring the only thing I have that’s worth more than my own life.” [567]

The logistician took it, turning the fragment over in their fingers like a jeweler appraising a gem. [587]
“This isn’t a trade,” they said. [593]
“It’s a *catalysis*.” [596]
Elias’s pulse quickened. [600]
“For what?” [602]
The logistician tucked the rock into their coat. [610]
“For the story that comes after. The one where you stop waiting for someone to save you.” [634]
Elias opened his mouth to protest, but the logistician was already walking away, their silhouette dissolving into the ivy like smoke. [662]
“Wait—what about the cure?” he called, his voice raw. [676]

The logistician paused. [679]
“Loneliness isn’t a disease,” they said. [687]
“It’s a debt. And you’ve just paid yours forward.” [702]
Then they were gone, leaving Elias alone on the platform with the weight of his own breath and the slow, creeping realization that the story had changed. [735]
The station wasn’t a hub for favors. [743]
It was a place where people came to learn that the only cure for loneliness was to stop hoarding it. [763]
Elias clutched the slip of paper the logistician had left behind—*later*—and for the first time in years, he didn’t feel empty. [790]
He felt like a man who had just been handed the beginning of something. [806]
