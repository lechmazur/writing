The observatory’s domed ceiling arched like a sigh over Elias Voss, its brass gears frozen mid-turn, their purpose long forgotten. [18]
Dust motes swirled in the slanted light, caught between the heavy velvet curtains that framed the telescope’s eyepiece—curtains of intention, Elias called them, though no one had asked in years. [49]
He traced the edge of his latest mourning ring, its black enamel cool against his calloused fingers, the weight of grief pressed into every facet. [77]
The stencil on the vellum beside him was nearly complete: a thorned vine curling around the name *Liora*, her absence a wound he couldn’t stop picking at. [109]

Elias had hit rock bottom the day he found her tools scattered across the workbench, her half-finished pieces left like accusations. [134]
She had been the one to teach him how to coax beauty from sorrow, how to set a pearl into a setting that made it weep. [159]
Now, he was the last of them, the last who remembered how to shape memory into something wearable. [180]

A knock at the observatory’s iron door startled him. [187]
No one came here anymore—not since the city’s clocktower had stopped keeping time, not since the stars had begun to blur at the edges. [214]
Elias pulled the curtains tighter, as if they could shield him from whatever waited on the other side. [236]
The knock came again, softer this time, persistent. [245]

He opened the door to find a child no older than ten, her hair tied back with a ribbon that had once been vibrant. [269]
In her hands was a small origami crane, its wings folded with deliberate care. [283]
“For you,” she said, holding it out. [289]
Elias took it, turning it over to find a set of coordinates inked inside the paper’s belly. [309]
“Who sent you?” he asked, but the girl was already gone, vanished into the twilight like a breath. [330]

The coordinates led him to the city’s abandoned botanical gardens, where the glass panes of the conservatory had long since shattered, leaving only skeletal frames. [359]
Inside, a single rosebush bloomed in defiance of the season, its petals a deep, artificial crimson—genuinely artificial, as if someone had painted each one by hand. [389]
At its base lay another origami figure, this time a fox, its tail curled around a new set of numbers. [413]

Elias followed the trail like a man chasing his own shadow. [427]
Each figure led him deeper into the city’s forgotten corners: a crumbling library where the books whispered if you pressed your ear to their spines, a clockmaker’s shop where the gears still turned despite the hands having fallen off years ago. [468]
The origami was always there, waiting—always with coordinates, always with the faintest scent of Liora’s lavender perfume. [495]

The final figure was a lotus, its petals unfolding to reveal a single word: *Illuminate*. [513]
Elias looked up to see the observatory’s dome above him, its shutters pried open just enough to let in a sliver of starlight. [541]
He climbed the spiral staircase, his breath shallow, his hands trembling. [556]
At the top, the telescope was trained on a patch of sky he hadn’t dared to look at in years. [579]

Through the eyepiece, he saw it: a constellation he’d thought lost, its stars flickering like candles in the dark. [603]
And there, in the space between the points of light, was Liora’s face—not as she had been at the end, but as she had been when she first taught him the art of mourning jewelry, her eyes alight with the same quiet fire that had once burned in him. [654]
“You have to let them wither,” she said, her voice woven into the hum of the observatory’s dormant machinery. [680]
“Only then can they bloom again.” [690]

Elias exhaled, the weight in his chest loosening for the first time in years. [710]
He reached for the tattoo stencil, its ink still wet, and pressed it to his wrist. [729]
The thorns would stay, but so would the vine. [742]
He would teach himself to wear the grief, not drown in it. [758]

Outside, the city’s clocks began to chime, their sound uneven but alive. [774]
Elias smiled. [777]
The origami figures would keep coming, he knew. [790]
And so would he. [795]
