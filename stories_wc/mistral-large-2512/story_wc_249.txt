The first time Elias heard the drumming, he thought it was his heart. [12]
He lay strapped to the cold metal table, the experimental serum still burning through his veins like liquid starlight. [30]
The scientists had called it a breakthrough—memory entanglement, they said, a way to share thoughts without words. [50]
But Elias had volunteered for one reason: to remember his sister, Liora, who had vanished three years ago into the auric lagoon. [73]
They told him the treatment was safe. [79]
They lied. [81]

The drumming grew louder, not from the lab’s speakers, but from somewhere deeper, as if the universe itself had begun to pulse. [109]
Elias’s fingers twitched against the restraints, his nails tapping out a rhythm against the table’s edge. [128]
The scientists didn’t notice—too busy scribbling notes, their faces lit by the sterile glow of monitors. [148]
But Elias did. [151]
The rhythm was hers. [155]
Liora’s. [157]

He had always been quietly rebellious, even as a child, sneaking out to the sound wave garden where the air hummed with frequencies no one else could hear. [187]
Liora had found him there once, perched on the edge of the garden’s central sculpture, her fingers drumming on the resonant metal like she was trying to wake the earth. [222]
“You’re not supposed to be here,” she’d whispered, though her smile said otherwise. [239]
“Neither are you,” he’d shot back, and she’d laughed, the sound weaving into the garden’s vibrations like a secret. [263]

Now, in the lab, the drumming pulled him back to that moment, to the way the starlight had rippled across the auric lagoon like liquid silver. [291]
Liora had loved that place, had spent hours there, her reflection shimmering in the water as if she were made of the same light. [318]
She’d always said the lagoon was alive, that it breathed in time with the universe. [337]
Elias had never believed her—not until now. [345]

The serum was working. [349]
Or maybe it was breaking him. [354]
Memories flickered behind his eyes, not his own, but Liora’s—her last moments, standing at the lagoon’s edge at the hush of the universe inhaling. [383]
She had been trying to breathe life into a shared dream, one she’d never named, only hummed into existence with her drumming. [411]
And then she was gone. [416]

Elias gasped, his back arching off the table. [424]
The scientists shouted, but their voices were distant, drowned out by the drumming, by Liora’s voice whispering in his skull: *Find me.* [453]
The restraints snapped. [456]
He didn’t remember moving, but suddenly he was on his feet, the lab spinning around him as the serum rewired his senses. [482]
The air smelled like ozone and old paper, like the sound wave garden after rain. [499]
He stumbled toward the exit, his fingers drumming against the walls, the floor, the glass of the observation window. [526]
Each tap sent a ripple through the air, and for a moment, he saw her—the outline of her face in the glass, her lips moving in time with his rhythm. [560]

The scientists were shouting now, their voices sharp with panic. [574]
Elias didn’t care. [577]
He had one goal: to reach the lagoon before the universe exhaled again. [594]
He ran, the drumming guiding him like a heartbeat, through the sterile halls, out into the night. [616]
The sound wave garden loomed ahead, its sculptures humming with latent energy, waiting for his touch. [639]
He perched on the edge of the central piece, his fingers flying over the metal, the rhythm wild and desperate. [664]
The lagoon shimmered in the distance, its waters glowing with the same light that now pulsed through his veins. [691]

And then he heard it—the universe inhaling, a sound like the world holding its breath. [713]
Liora’s voice rose above the drumming, clear and bright: *You came.* [726]
Elias closed his eyes, the serum burning hotter, the memories entangling tighter. [743]
He wasn’t just Elias anymore. [749]
He was her. [752]
They were both there, at the lagoon’s edge, drumming on the water, on the air, on the very bones of the earth. [780]
The dream wasn’t lost. [784]
It was alive. [787]
And so were they. [790]
[791]
