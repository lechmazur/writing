The orchard clung to the cliff’s edge like a beggar’s grip on a ledge, its gnarled roots twisting through cracks in the stone. [18]
Mira had never wanted to tend it—no one in their right mind would—but the curse had chosen her the moment she set foot on the property, binding her to the land as surely as the vines bound the trees. [56]
She knelt in the damp soil, fingers brushing the bark of a withered peach tree, its branches heavy with fruit that would never ripen. [84]
A small nut, no larger than her thumbnail, rolled from beneath the leaves, its shell smooth and unnaturally warm. [109]
She pocketed it without thought, the way one might absentmindedly collect a pebble from a riverbank. [131]

The blueprint had been forgotten for decades, buried beneath layers of dust in the old gardener’s shed. [154]
Mira found it by accident while searching for shears, her fingers tracing the offhandedly exact measurements scrawled in faded ink—each line precise, each angle deliberate, as if the architect had known the labyrinth’s every secret before it was built. [193]
The paper crackled under her touch, brittle with age, but the design was clear: a path through the cliffside maze, marked by the same cursed trees that now bent to her will. [230]

The mechanical birds patrolled the labyrinth at dusk, their brass wings glinting in the dying light. [252]
They were not kind creatures. [257]
Their beaks could snap bone, and their eyes, though glass, saw everything. [274]
Mira had learned to move between their patrols, her steps silent as the frost that would soon creep over the cliffs. [299]
Before the night frost formed, she had to assemble the pieces of the blueprint’s puzzle—or another traveler would vanish into the maze, swallowed by the earth or the birds’ hunger. [337]

She had no love for the lost. [343]
Most were fools, lured by whispers of treasure or salvation, blind to the danger. [358]
But the curse demanded balance: for every life taken by the orchard, one must be spared. [376]
Mira had failed too many times. [382]
The guilt sat in her chest like a stone, heavy and unyielding. [396]

The nut in her pocket pulsed faintly, as if alive. [407]
She pulled it out, turning it over in her palm. [416]
Its shell was marked with the same offhandedly exact lines as the blueprint, a miniature map of the labyrinth’s heart. [442]
To guide the lost, she realized, she didn’t need to lead them herself. [458]
She only needed to leave impressions without touching—hints so subtle they’d think the path was their own discovery. [484]

Mira scattered the nuts along the maze’s edge, pressing them into the damp earth where the mechanical birds wouldn’t notice. [513]
Each one bore the same markings, a breadcrumb trail for those who knew how to look. [537]
She worked quickly, the wind tugging at her sleeves, the first tendrils of frost creeping over the stones. [562]

A scream echoed through the labyrinth. [568]
Mira froze. [570]
A man stumbled into view, his cloak torn, his face streaked with dirt. [587]
The mechanical birds circled above him, their wings casting jagged shadows. [604]
He saw her and lunged forward, desperation in his eyes. [618]
“Help me,” he gasped. [622]

Mira didn’t move. [625]
Instead, she pointed to the ground at his feet. [635]
A nut lay half-buried in the soil, its markings catching the last of the light. [652]
The man frowned, then crouched, brushing away the dirt. [665]
His fingers traced the lines, and something in his expression shifted—confusion giving way to understanding. [689]

“Follow the nuts,” Mira said, her voice rough as bark. [702]
The man nodded, already turning toward the next one. [715]
The mechanical birds shrieked, diving toward him, but he was faster now, his steps sure. [735]
Mira watched as he vanished into the maze, the path swallowing him whole. [754]

The frost settled over the orchard, silvering the leaves. [766]
Mira exhaled, her breath a cloud in the cold air. [779]
The curse would hold for another night. [788]
She turned back toward the trees, their branches heavy with fruit that would never be eaten. [809]
