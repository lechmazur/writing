The radio tower city of Vaelis hung suspended over the gorge like a forgotten dream, its rusted girders groaning under the weight of time and the relentless pull of the lunar perigee. [23]
Mira adjusted the dials on her celestial signal interpreter, the device humming serenely electric against her fingertips as it sifted through the static of the cosmos. [52]
She had come here for one reason: to find the beginning in every ending, a motivation that had driven her across continents and through the ruins of a thousand dead civilizations. [89]

The tower’s highest platform was her sanctuary, a place where the air thrummed with the echoes of old broadcasts and the whispers of distant stars. [120]
Tonight, the sky was alive with the perigee’s pull, the moon’s gravity warping the signals into something almost tangible. [143]
Mira’s fingers hovered over the interpreter’s cracked screen, where a single shard of light pulsed—an anomaly in the noise. [168]
She reached into her satchel and withdrew the Hollywood star fragment, its polished surface catching the moonlight like a mirror to another world. [193]

The shard had been given to her by an old archivist in Los Angeles, who claimed it was a piece of the first film ever projected—a relic of humanity’s first attempt to capture light itself. [230]
Mira had never believed in relics, but she believed in patterns, and the star’s geometry matched the anomaly on her screen. [254]
She pressed the fragment against the interpreter’s input port, and the device shuddered, its circuits flaring with a serenely electric glow. [282]

The static dissolved into silence—a shard of hush so complete it felt like the universe had taken a breath. [308]
Mira’s pulse quickened. [312]
This was what she had been searching for: not the beginning of time, but the moment before sound, before light, before the first vibration of existence. [348]
The interpreter’s screen flickered, and a voice, neither male nor female but something older, spoke in a language that bypassed her ears and settled directly into her bones. [385]

*"You seek the origin, but origins are illusions."* [396]
Mira exhaled, her breath fogging the cold air. [405]
The voice was right. [409]
She had spent years chasing the first signal, the first word, the first spark, only to realize that beginnings were just endings in disguise. [440]
The perigee’s pull intensified, and the tower groaned as if it, too, were straining to hear. [464]

She had to tune the interpreter differently. [472]
Not by searching, but by discarding assumptions—letting go of the idea that the past was a fixed point, that time was a line instead of a circle. [507]
Mira adjusted the frequency, not to capture the first signal, but to listen for the silence between them. [532]
The shard of hush deepened, and the interpreter’s screen went dark. [549]

Then, a new sound emerged—not a voice, not a word, but a vibration so pure it felt like the universe remembering itself. [583]
The Hollywood star fragment glowed, its edges dissolving into light. [599]
Mira understood then: the beginning wasn’t a moment to be found, but a state to be returned to. [627]
The perigee’s pull reached its peak, and the tower trembled, its rusted bolts screaming as they gave way. [651]

She didn’t flinch. [654]
The city was falling, but she was already somewhere else—where time folded in on itself, where endings and beginnings were the same. [689]
The interpreter’s screen flared one last time, and the shard of hush swallowed her whole. [712]

When the tower hit the gorge below, the impact sent a shockwave through the earth, but Mira was gone, tuned to a frequency beyond sound, beyond time. [746]
The Hollywood star fragment lay in the wreckage, its glow fading as the perigee passed. [766]
Somewhere, in the silence between the signals, she had found what she was looking for. [787]
