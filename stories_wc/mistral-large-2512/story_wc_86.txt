The parapet clung to the cliffside like a scar, its stones slick with mist and the salt of a thousand forgotten storms. [18]
Elias Veyne stood at its edge, his breath shallow, his fingers tracing the cold iron of the antique drawer pull in his pocket. [41]
It was the only thing he’d kept from his father’s house—the last remnant of a life he’d untethered himself from years ago. [70]
Now, it was his talisman, a reminder of why he did this work: to recycle mistakes into wisdom, not just his own, but theirs too. [98]

The prisoner exchange was set for dawn, the agreed-upon neutral territory between the warring coastal cities of Veyre and Lirien. [125]
No man’s land, they called it, though the sea below claimed everything eventually. [139]
Elias had chosen this spot—the storm-worn parapet—for its precarious balance. [154]
Too high for ambushes, too exposed for secrets. [162]
The mist would swallow lies before they reached the other side. [174]

His counterpart, a Lirien diplomat named Seris, arrived first, her silhouette emerging from the gloom like a ghost. [195]
She was uncommonly thoughtful, he’d heard, a trait that had kept her alive in negotiations where others had lost fingers or worse. [220]
“You’re early,” Elias said, his voice rough from disuse. [229]
Seris tilted her head, the wind tugging at her dark braid. [239]
“So are you.” [242]
A pause. [244]
Between them stretched the fragile timeframe between apology and forgiveness, a space neither had dared to name. [268]

The exchange was simple: Veyre’s captured spymaster for Lirien’s stolen heirloom, a relic said to hold the first treaty between their cities. [292]
But Elias knew better than to trust simplicity. [302]
He’d spent weeks synchronizing their movements through moon phases, ensuring neither side could strike under cover of darkness. [328]
The full moon had passed three nights ago; now, the waning crescent hung like a blade above the sea. [349]

Seris stepped forward, her boots silent on the wet stone. [361]
“You brought it?” [365]
Elias nodded, pulling the drawer pull from his pocket. [374]
It was brass, tarnished green at the edges, its surface worn smooth by generations of anxious hands. [392]
“Proof,” he said. [395]
Seris exhaled, her breath curling into the mist. [405]
“They’ll ask for more.” [411]
“They always do.” [415]

The wind howled, and for a moment, Elias let himself imagine what it would be like to untether from this life entirely. [445]
No more negotiations, no more balancing on the edge of war. [459]
But then he thought of the spymaster, a man who’d once been his friend, and the heirloom, a symbol of a peace that had never truly been. [496]
Some mistakes couldn’t be recycled—they could only be carried, like stones in a pocket. [518]

Seris reached into her cloak and withdrew a small, wrapped bundle. [532]
“The relic,” she said. [536]
Elias took it, his fingers brushing against hers. [544]
The contact was brief, but it burned. [552]
He unwrapped the cloth to reveal a locket, its surface etched with the same moon phases he’d used to time their meeting. [578]

“Clever,” he murmured. [581]
Seris smiled, just slightly. [585]
“Thoughtful,” she corrected. [590]
The wind died down, as if the world itself was holding its breath. [606]
Elias pocketed the locket and the drawer pull, the weight of both pressing against his thigh. [626]

“Dawn in an hour,” he said. [633]
Seris nodded. [636]
“They’ll come.” [639]
Neither moved. [642]
The parapet stretched between them, a bridge of stone and silence. [657]
Elias thought of his father, of the way the old man had always said wisdom was just regret with a purpose. [686]
Maybe that was true. [692]
Maybe that was enough. [697]

The first light of dawn crept over the horizon, painting the mist in shades of gold and gray. [723]
Elias took a step back, then another. [733]
Seris did the same. [738]
Between them, the space grew, but the silence remained, a furrowed hush that needed no words. [762]

The prisoners would arrive soon. [769]
The exchange would happen. [774]
And after, when the parapet was empty again, the sea would keep its secrets, and the moon would rise anew. [805]
Elias turned toward the path down the cliff, the drawer pull warm in his pocket. [823]
Some mistakes were recycled into wisdom. [830]
