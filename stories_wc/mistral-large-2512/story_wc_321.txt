The ferry *Maris* cut through the black water like a knife through silk, its single lantern casting a trembling gold circle on the waves. [18]
Elias, the ardent ferry deckhand, hummed an old sea shanty under his breath as he secured the last mooring line, his fingers calloused but gentle. [44]
Above him, the stars pulsed in interconnected patterns, their light weaving through the spectral grotto’s jagged arches like threads in a loom. [72]
He had seen this place a hundred times before—yet tonight, it felt different. [87]

The empty hourglass in his pocket was cold against his thigh, its sand long since spilled into some forgotten crevice of time. [113]
Elias had found it years ago, wedged between the planks of the *Maris*’s deck, and though he’d searched for its twin, the other half had never surfaced. [141]
Now, he carried it like a talisman, a reminder that time wasn’t just a river—it was a tide, pulling in all directions at once. [168]

The radio crackled to life, its voice static-laced but clear: *"Maris, do you read? The clocks are running sideways again."* [190]
Elias exhaled, his breath curling in the frigid air. [200]
He knew what that meant. [205]
The ferry was vanishing. [210]

Not in the way things vanished when forgotten—no, this was something older, something woven into the grotto’s bones. [234]
The *Maris* had always been a permanent transient, a vessel caught between ports, between moments, between the living and the lost. [259]
And tonight, the threads of time were unraveling. [270]

Elias climbed to the wheelhouse, his boots thudding against the salt-worn wood. [285]
Captain Veyra stood at the helm, her silver hair braided tight, her eyes fixed on the horizon where the stars bent like broken glass. [313]
"We’ve got passengers," she said, nodding toward the deck. [323]
Elias followed her gaze. [327]
A dozen figures stood motionless, their faces half-lit by the lantern’s glow—commuters, he realized, but not the usual kind. [350]
These were echoes, fragments of people who had ridden the *Maris* in other timelines, other lives. [371]
Some wore clothes from a century past; others, from a future not yet written. [388]

Elias’s chest tightened. [393]
This was why he stayed. [398]
Not for the pay, not for the routine, but for moments like this—when the world’s seams split open and let the impossible through. [429]
He was resiliently positive, not because he ignored the darkness, but because he believed in the light that slipped through the cracks. [458]

"Radio’s been quiet since the last transmission," Veyra muttered. [472]
Elias pulled the hourglass from his pocket, turning it over in his hands. [486]
The sand inside was still gone, but the glass hummed faintly, as if resonating with something beyond the grotto’s walls. [513]
"Maybe we don’t need the radio," he said. [524]
"Maybe we just need to listen to the patterns." [537]

Outside, the stars pulsed brighter, their light forming a bridge between the ferry and the grotto’s heart. [560]
Elias stepped forward, his voice steady. [570]
"Whoever you are, wherever you’re from—you’re not lost. [586]
You’re just waiting for the right moment to merge." [602]

The commuters stirred, their eyes flickering with recognition. [615]
One by one, they stepped forward, their forms shimmering like heat off pavement. [633]
The *Maris* groaned, its timbers vibrating as the air thickened with the scent of ozone and old paper. [655]
Elias closed his eyes, feeling the pull of parallel timelines, the weight of moments that had never quite happened, the promise of ones that still could. [690]

When he opened them again, the grotto was empty. [702]
The commuters were gone. [707]
The *Maris* sat still on the water, its lantern burning steady. [722]

Veyra exhaled, her shoulders relaxing. [729]
"Well," she said. [732]
"That’s one way to fix a vanishing ferry." [742]

Elias smiled, tucking the hourglass back into his pocket. [754]
Somewhere, in the spaces between seconds, he knew the commuters had found their way home. [775]
And the *Maris* would keep sailing, resiliently positive, a permanent transient between the tides of time. [799]
