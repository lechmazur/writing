The orchard planet of Veythar hung suspended in the void, its surface a patchwork of floating rock arches that cradled groves of bioluminescent fruit trees. [20]
Between the arches, the nebula of respite pulsed faintly, a swirl of violet and gold that whispered of forgotten rest. [38]
It was here, among the drifting stones and the hum of the nebula, that the ghost of Liora found her purpose. [58]

Liora had been dead for seventy-three years, but she refused to fade. [72]
Her translucent form flickered like a candle in the wind, visible only to those who needed her most. [89]
She had once been a gardener, tending the butterfly garden at the heart of the orchard, and though her hands could no longer touch the soil, she still watered the flowers in her own way. [129]
The watering bell—a delicate brass chime shaped like a blooming lotus—hung from the arch above the garden, its sound a signal for the living to gather. [156]

Strangers had come to Veythar over the years, refugees from dying worlds, and slowly, they had become family. [177]
Liora had watched as they built homes in the hollows of the arches, as they learned to harvest the fruit without bruising its glow. [198]
But now, the orchard was sick. [204]
The trees bore fewer blossoms each season, and the butterflies, once a riot of color, had dwindled to a handful of fragile wings. [228]

Liora knew she couldn’t fix it alone. [236]
She needed the living to reexamine their habits, to see the orchard not as a resource, but as a partner. [259]
And so, at dawn, she began to write. [268]

The first message appeared on the cracked stone path leading to the garden: *"The roots remember kindness."* [287]
The words were chalked in shimmering white, as if the nebula itself had bled onto the ground. [309]
The next morning, another: *"Water the butterflies, not just the trees."* [326]
By the third dawn, the entire village had gathered, murmuring over the strange, trustworthy script. [347]

No one knew who was leaving the messages, but the handwriting was familiar—soft, looping, like the curves of the watering bell’s engravings. [371]
A child, barely old enough to read, pointed at Liora’s old gardening shed. [386]
"Maybe it’s her," they whispered. [392]
The adults scoffed, but the child’s mother knelt and touched the chalk dust, her fingers coming away glowing faintly. [418]

That night, Liora hovered near the bell, willing it to ring. [431]
She had no breath to blow, no hands to strike it, but the nebula hummed in response, and the bell chimed once, a sound like a sigh. [460]
The villagers froze. [463]
Then, as one, they turned toward the garden. [472]

The next morning, the messages changed. [480]
*"The arches are alive—listen."* [487]
*"The nebula feeds the soil, but only if we let it."* [503]
The villagers began to experiment, pressing their ears to the floating rocks, letting the violet light bathe their skin. [528]
They discovered that the arches sang when touched, that the nebula’s glow strengthened the roots. [550]

Liora watched as they worked together, not out of duty, but out of love. [567]
A farmer who had once hoarded fruit now shared it freely. [579]
A weaver who had ignored the butterflies knelt to repair a broken wing. [596]
The orchard responded, its leaves rustling in approval. [608]

On the seventh dawn, the final message appeared: *"You were always the gardeners."* [626]
The villagers stood in silence, then turned to the watering bell. [640]
One by one, they rang it, their voices rising in a chorus of thanks. [657]
Liora smiled, her form glowing brighter than the nebula. [671]

The butterflies returned first, a cloud of iridescent wings. [683]
Then the trees bloomed, their fruit heavier and sweeter than before. [699]
The arches hummed in harmony, and the nebula of respite shone steady and strong. [719]

Liora knew her time was ending. [727]
She had orchestrated collective effort, not through force, but through trust. [743]
As the villagers danced beneath the floating stones, she let herself fade, her last thought a whisper: *"Thank you."* [768]

The watering bell rang one final time, its sound carrying into the nebula, where it would wait for the next stranger who needed a home. [799]
