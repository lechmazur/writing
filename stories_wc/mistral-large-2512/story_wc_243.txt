The blooming jetty at twilight was the only place where Elias could breathe without feeling the past press against his ribs. [17]
He sat on the weathered planks, the wood still warm from the day’s sun, and let the scent of salt and sea lavender steep into his skin. [43]
His fingers traced the edges of the locket photo in his palm—a small, silver oval that held the last image of his sister, Liora, before the flood took her. [78]
She had given it to him the night before, her smile faint but knowing, as if she had already seen the water rising. [106]

Elias was a walnut-ink archivist, a title that meant little to most but everything to him. [125]
His work was gently thorough, a slow unraveling of stories too fragile to survive the rush of time. [145]
He had spent years transcribing the lives of those who lived along the coast, their voices preserved in ink that smelled of earth and decay. [172]
But Liora’s voice was the one he could never capture, no matter how many pages he filled. [191]

The covenant had been broken long ago, when the old lighthouse keeper sealed the jetty with a promise: that no one would drown here again. [220]
Yet the sea had taken Liora anyway, and the covenant regenerated in ways no one expected. [239]
It wasn’t a spell or a prayer, but something quieter—a shared understanding that the jetty would hold them, even when the waves did not. [270]

Elias had come here when context changed, when the town’s memory of Liora began to fade. [291]
The photo in the locket was all that remained of her face, and he feared that soon, even that would blur into nothing. [318]
He had tried to preserve her in other ways—through stories, through ink, through the careful arrangement of objects in his study. [347]
But none of it felt like enough. [355]

A gull cried overhead, its wings cutting through the twilight. [368]
Elias looked up, watching the bird circle before landing on the railing beside him. [387]
It tilted its head, as if waiting for him to speak. [398]

He opened the locket again, studying Liora’s face. [411]
She had been the one who taught him to see the weight of small moments—the way the light hit the water at dusk, the sound of a page turning, the quiet between words. [451]
Now, he was the one left to carry them. [462]

The sea lapped at the pilings below, a rhythm that had once been comforting. [480]
But tonight, it felt like a countdown. [490]
Elias knew he couldn’t keep Liora’s memory alive forever, not through ink or lockets or covenants. [516]
The only way to truly preserve her was to let her go, to let the sea take the weight of her absence as it had taken her body. [551]

He stood, the locket warm in his hand. [560]
The gull took flight, its wings beating against the fading light. [576]
Elias stepped to the edge of the jetty, the wood creaking beneath him. [593]
He had spent so long trying to hold onto her through proximate causes—through objects, through stories, through the fragile threads of memory. [628]
But some things could only be understood when you stopped trying to control them. [650]

The locket slipped from his fingers, catching the last of the twilight before it vanished beneath the waves. [674]
For a moment, the water seemed to glow, as if something beneath it had recognized the offering. [699]
Elias exhaled, his breath mingling with the salt air. [713]

The covenant had regenerated, not in stone or ink, but in the quiet understanding that some losses could not be mended—only carried. [745]
And for the first time in years, he felt Liora’s presence not as a ghost, but as a whisper in the wind. [774]
The jetty bloomed around him, alive with the weight of small moments, and Elias finally let himself belong to them. [800]
