The fisher stood on the black sand shore, his breath steady as the tide. [12]
Behind him, the sound wave garden hummed, its silver reeds bending in the wind like the ribs of a sleeping giant. [33]
He had come here not for fish, but for the echo of a goddess—one that only sang when patterns broke themselves. [58]
His name was Kael, and he was known for being cool-headed, even when the sea itself seemed to rage without reason. [83]

That night, the constellations above began to sleepwalk. [91]
They drifted from their usual paths, their light flickering like dying embers. [107]
Kael watched as Orion’s belt unraveled, the stars zigzagging across the sky as if fleeing some unseen predator. [131]
He had heard the old stories—how the heavens sometimes forgot their place, how the world trembled when the sky lost its way. [157]
But this was different. [160]
This was a sign. [163]

In his pocket, he carried a rusted rail spike, its weight familiar against his thigh. [180]
It had been given to him by a dying sailor who claimed it had once held together the tracks of a train that never reached its destination. [209]
Kael didn’t believe in omens, but he kept it anyway, because the man’s hands had been cold, and his voice had trembled like the reeds in the garden. [242]

The sound wave garden was alive tonight. [248]
The silver reeds vibrated, not with wind, but with something deeper—a resonance that transliterated emotions into something almost tangible. [274]
Kael pressed his palm against one, and the reed pulsed beneath his fingers, whispering of longing, of grief, of the quiet desperation of things left unfinished. [307]
He pulled his hand back. [310]
Too much. [312]

He needed the goddess’s echo, not the garden’s sorrow. [325]
The stories said she had once walked the earth, her voice weaving the first songs into the world. [344]
But she had vanished, leaving only echoes behind—fragments of sound that lingered in places where the air itself was thin. [373]
Kael had spent years chasing them, listening for the faintest whisper in the spaces between waves, between breaths. [399]

Tonight, the sky’s chaos had disrupted the garden’s harmony. [410]
The reeds no longer hummed in unison; they shrieked, they sighed, they moaned. [428]
Kael knelt, pressing his ear to the ground. [436]
There—beneath the noise—a rhythm, faint but unmistakable. [450]
The echo. [451]

He stood, gripping the rail spike tightly. [460]
The goddess’s voice was not meant to be caught, not really. [472]
But he had to try. [476]
He began to walk, not in a straight line, but in a zigzag, letting the garden’s dissonance guide him. [500]
The reeds parted before him, their silver leaves brushing against his arms like the fingers of the dead. [526]

Then, silence. [528]
Not the absence of sound, but something deeper—a void that swallowed noise whole. [548]
Kael stopped. [550]
This was the place. [553]

He raised the rail spike, not as a weapon, but as an offering. [568]
The goddess’s echo was a feral lullaby, a song that soothed and terrified in equal measure. [591]
He closed his eyes and listened. [596]

And then, he heard it. [600]
Not with his ears, but with his bones—a vibration that resonated through the spike, through the earth, through him. [625]
The garden stilled. [628]
The reeds stood straight, their song now a single, clear note. [643]

Kael opened his mouth, not to speak, but to voice silence. [657]
The words were not his own; they were the echo’s, the goddess’s, the sky’s. [675]
They spilled out of him, not in any language he knew, but in a sound that made the stars pause in their sleepwalking. [705]

For a moment, the world held its breath. [713]
Then, the constellations settled back into their patterns, the garden’s song faded, and Kael was left standing alone on the shore, the rail spike warm in his hand. [747]
He had caught the echo. [752]
Or perhaps it had caught him. [757]

The tide rolled in, cool and indifferent. [765]
Kael exhaled, his breath steady once more. [773]
Somewhere, the goddess was still singing. [780]
And he would listen. [784]
[785]
