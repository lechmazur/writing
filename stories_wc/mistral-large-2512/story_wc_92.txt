The luminous fort at twilight was never truly dark, not even during the unexplained blackout that had plunged the city into silence. [19]
Its walls, lined with bioluminescent moss, pulsed faintly like a dying heartbeat, casting long shadows that danced with secrets. [43]
Mira adjusted the brass goggles perched on her forehead, her fingers tracing the etched runes along the lenses—tools of her trade as the fort’s vigilant lock sentinel. [78]
She had spent years memorizing every tumbler, every false keyhole, every whispered betrayal hidden in the fort’s labyrinthine vaults. [107]
But tonight, the locks weren’t her concern. [114]
The bronze quill holder on the governor’s desk was. [122]

It sat there, innocuous, its surface dull under the moss-light, yet Mira knew its weight. [142]
Inside, the governor kept his most dangerous correspondences, each letter a spark waiting to ignite. [161]
She had seen the coded angles in the half-painted sundial outside his window—an old cipher, one only a few could read. [184]
The angles pointed to tonight, to the blackout, to the moment when the fort’s defenses would be blind. [208]
Mira exhaled, her breath steady, her mind calmly inventive. [220]
If she was going to spark a silent revolution, she needed those letters. [234]

The door creaked. [237]
Mira pressed herself into the shadows, her pulse a quiet drum in her throat. [255]
The governor’s aide shuffled in, his boots scuffing against the stone, his lantern casting jagged light across the walls. [280]
He paused, as if sensing the intrigue hanging thick in the air, then reached for the quill holder. [301]
Mira’s fingers twitched toward the lockpicks at her belt, but she forced herself still. [321]
The aide wasn’t stealing—he was leaving something. [330]
A single sheet of parchment, rolled tight, slipped into the holder’s hidden compartment. [348]
Then he was gone, the door clicking shut behind him. [359]

Mira waited, counting the seconds in her head. [369]
When the fort’s distant chimes tolled the half-hour, she moved. [384]
The quill holder was heavier than it looked, its bronze cool against her palms. [403]
She pried open the compartment with a hairpin, her hands steady despite the thrill coiling in her chest. [428]
The parchment unrolled with a whisper, the ink smudged but legible. [441]
*"The cradle of sparks will be lit at the third watch. The sentinels will not see."* [460]

Her breath hitched. [463]
This wasn’t just a letter—it was a call to arms. [473]
The governor was planning something, something that would burn the city to the ground before the people even realized they were in danger. [503]
Mira’s mind raced, her thoughts snapping together like gears. [515]
The sundial’s angles, the blackout, the quill holder—it all pointed to one thing. [532]
The revolution wouldn’t start with shouts or swords. [543]
It would start with silence, with cunning, with the flicker of a single spark in the dark. [563]

She tucked the parchment into her sleeve and slipped from the room, her steps soundless. [583]
The fort’s corridors were a maze of shifting shadows, but Mira knew them better than her own reflection. [608]
She paused at the armory, where the lanterns burned low, their light barely reaching the racks of swords and crossbows. [635]
A single torch sat in a sconce, unlit. [645]
Mira smiled, a winking hush of a thing. [655]
She struck flint to steel, and the torch flared to life, casting her shadow long and sharp against the wall. [680]
Then she moved on, leaving the torch where it would be found—where it would be seen as a signal. [708]

By the time the governor’s men realized the blackout was no accident, the fort’s lower levels would already be awake, murmuring, planning. [737]
Mira didn’t need to be there when the first barricade went up. [753]
She had done her part. [758]
The revolution would burn on its own. [766]

She stepped into the twilight, the fort’s glow at her back, the city’s silence stretching before her like a promise. [791]
Somewhere, a lock clicked open. [797]
Somewhere, a spark caught. [802]
And the world held its breath. [808]
