The lantern maker, Veyra, had always been too clever for her own good. [10]
Her fingers, stained with soot and solder, moved with the precision of a thief’s lockpick as she adjusted the wick of a half-finished lantern. [30]
The glass basilica on the floating isle above her glowed like a fallen star, its spires refracting the last light of dusk into fractured rainbows. [57]
She had never set foot inside it—no one had, not since the shadow detached. [72]

That was the way of things now: the world split cleanly between what was and what had been. [89]
The shadow, once a mere absence, had peeled away like dead skin, leaving the sky a raw wound of violet and gold. [114]
Veyra didn’t know where it had gone, only that it no longer clung to the edges of things. [130]
She suspected it was better that way. [136]

Her tea garden, a cluster of floating platforms held aloft by chains of enchanted silver, swayed gently in the updrafts. [159]
The air smelled of jasmine and damp earth, though the earth was only an illusion—beneath the platforms, there was nothing but sky. [184]
Veyra had built the garden after her brother died, folding his grief into origami cranes until her hands cramped. [207]
She hung them from the branches of a bonsai tree that grew upside down, its roots reaching for the heavens. [228]
The cranes fluttered in the wind, their paper wings catching the light like broken glass. [244]

She had come to the floating isle for the dreams. [252]
Not her own—those were too tangled with memories of her brother’s laughter, the way his voice had cracked when he lied. [277]
No, she needed the dreams of others, the ones that pooled in the glass basilica like liquid silver. [297]
The priests who tended it claimed the dreams were recordings, fragments of souls left behind when the shadow tore free. [324]
Veyra didn’t care about their theories. [332]
She only cared that the dreams could be shaped, polished like gems until they gleamed with something resembling truth. [355]

The method was simple, if tedious. [361]
She would climb the silver chains to the basilica’s lowest balcony, where the priests left offerings of dream-catchers woven from spider silk. [388]
Inside, the air hummed with the weight of a thousand sleepless nights. [404]
Veyra would press her palm to the glass floor, feeling the vibrations of dreams beneath her skin. [426]
Then, she would choose. [430]

Not all dreams were useful. [435]
Some were too brittle, shattering at the first touch. [446]
Others were too soft, melting like wax in her hands. [458]
But the ones she wanted—the ones that *descended while ascending*—those were rare. [473]
They were the dreams of people who had lost something irreplaceable, who reached for the sky only to find their hands full of smoke. [504]
Veyra would take those dreams and carry them back to her workshop, where she would polish them with a cloth dipped in crushed moonstone. [537]
The process transformed them, smoothing their edges until they fit perfectly into the lanterns she built. [562]

The first time she lit one, she nearly dropped it. [573]
The dream inside unspooled like a ribbon of light, casting shadows that moved on their own. [596]
She saw a woman standing on a cliff, her arms outstretched as if to embrace the sky. [617]
The woman wept, but her tears turned to birds midair, their wings brushing the clouds. [640]
Veyra recognized the grief—it was her own, but sharper, cleaner, as if someone had taken a knife to the tangled mess of her heart and carved away the rot. [681]

She made more lanterns after that. [689]
Each one held a different dream, a different sorrow. [702]
The priests began to notice. [708]
They left offerings at the edge of her garden: vials of starlight, feathers from birds that had never existed, a single silver key that opened nothing. [743]
Veyra ignored them. [747]
She was too busy folding grief into origami cranes, hanging them from the bonsai’s roots like prayers. [770]

One evening, as the glass basilica pulsed with captured dreams, Veyra realized something terrible. [790]
The lanterns weren’t just holding the dreams—they were *feeding* them. [808]
The sorrow inside was growing, stretching, reaching for something beyond the glass. [829]
And then, with a sound like breaking ice, the first lantern shattered. [846]
The dream inside spilled out, a ribbon of light that coiled around her wrist like a serpent. [871]
It whispered her brother’s name. [878]
Veyra did not scream. [883]
She only watched as the light climbed her arm, her shoulder, her throat, and then—[906]
—then it was inside her, and the world *transformed*. [919]
