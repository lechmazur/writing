The cobalt arcade hummed with the ghostly glow of dying neon, its flickering screens casting long, wavering shadows across the cracked linoleum. [19]
Jace adjusted the strap of his mailbag, the weight of disputed letters pressing against his ribs like a secret he couldn’t deliver. [42]
At twilight, the border town of Veyra became a liminal space—neither here nor there, just a stretch of pavement where two nations had once carved their names into the earth before abandoning the fight. [80]
He was the only mailman left, a relic of a bureaucracy that had forgotten its own purpose, and tonight, at the day’s lone mail drop, he had one job: deliver the undeliverable. [122]

The thunderstorm in a bottle sat on the arcade’s prize counter, its glass clouded with swirling gray mist. [144]
Jace had won it years ago, back when the arcade still had prizes worth winning, back when he still believed in the illusion of permanence. [174]
Now, it was just another artifact of a life that had slipped through his fingers, like the letters he carried—each one a promise broken, a name misspelled, a home no longer on any map. [212]

A drone buzzed overhead, its sleek black body cutting through the twilight like a knife. [230]
Border patrols had been automated years ago, but smugglers still used them, slipping contraband through the gaps in the sky where no one was watching. [259]
Jace had seen them before, these mechanical shadows, and he knew what they carried: not just goods, but absences. [282]
A child’s toy sent to a parent who’d vanished. A letter from a lover who’d been deported. A life, fragmented, stitched together by the quiet rebellion of those who refused to let distance win. [322]

He reached into his bag and pulled out the first envelope, its edges worn from being handled too many times. [344]
The address was smudged, the ink bleeding into the paper like a bruise. [358]
It was meant for the old watchmaker’s shop on the other side of the border, but the shop had burned down last winter, and no one had bothered to update the records. [392]
Jace had tried to return it, but the sender had moved, or died, or simply stopped caring. [413]
So he kept it, like all the others, a silent protest against the erasure of names. [436]

The arcade’s back door creaked open, and a girl slipped inside, her boots scuffing against the floor. [456]
She couldn’t have been older than sixteen, her dark hair tied back in a messy braid, her eyes sharp with the kind of defiance that came from knowing the world was rigged but playing anyway. [495]
“You’re late,” Jace said, not looking up from the letter. [508]
“Had to avoid a patrol drone,” she muttered, kicking a loose tile back into place. [527]
Her name was Mira, and she was the closest thing he had to family now. [542]
She’d shown up one night, half-starved and full of questions, and he’d let her stay, not out of kindness, but because he recognized the look in her eyes—the same one he’d seen in the mirror every morning. [580]

She nodded at the thunderstorm in a bottle. [589]
“You ever open it?” [594]
“No,” Jace said. [597]
“Why not?” [600]
“Because some storms aren’t meant to be unleashed.” [612]
Mira rolled her eyes but didn’t push. [622]
She knew better than to ask about the things he didn’t say. [636]
Instead, she pulled a small device from her pocket—a signal jammer, jury-rigged from scavenged parts. [656]
“Got a drop tonight,” she said. [664]
“Where?” [667]
“Same place as always. The old observatory.” [679]
Jace exhaled, the weight of the letters suddenly heavier. [693]
The observatory was a ruin now, its dome cracked, its telescopes long since looted, but it was still the highest point in Veyra, and the only place where a drone could slip through the border’s blind spot. [743]

He didn’t ask what she was smuggling. [751]
It didn’t matter. [754]
What mattered was that someone, somewhere, was waiting for it. [770]
That was the only reason he ever helped her—because he knew what it was like to be the one left behind. [796]
To foster hope in the cracks of a world that had forgotten how to care. [813]

Mira flicked the jammer on, and the arcade’s lights dimmed, the hum of the machines fading into silence. [837]
Outside, the first drops of rain began to fall, tapping against the windows like fingers drumming on glass. [860]
Jace tucked the thunderstorm in a bottle into his bag, alongside the letters. [877]
Some promises couldn’t be kept. [883]
But some could be carried, just a little longer. [894]
