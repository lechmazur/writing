The icebound spire loomed above the clouds, its jagged crown wreathed in a glow that wasn’t quite light, but not darkness either—what the old texts called *lingering luminance*. [23]
Elias Veyne, an underachieving mage of the third circle, huddled in his threadbare robes, his breath fogging the air as he stared at the structure. [49]
He had come here not for glory, but because the spire was said to *accommodate impossibilities*, bending reality just enough to let the unworthy glimpse the divine. [83]
And Elias, who had spent his life failing at grand spells, was desperate to find the sacred in the simple. [108]

The climb had taken days, his fingers numb, his magic too weak to warm him. [124]
At the spire’s base, half-buried in snow, stood a garden folly—an ornate archway of frost-cracked stone, its keystone carved with a symbol that pulsed faintly, like a dying ember. [158]
Elias had read about such things: remnants of an age *when creativity got automated*, when machines had woven spells into architecture before the world forgot how. [189]
He reached out, brushing the keystone with his fingertips. [201]
The symbol flared, and the air hummed. [208]

A voice, neither male nor female, whispered from the stone: *"Unstrap your doubts."* [223]
Elias blinked. [225]
His satchel, heavy with failed spellbooks and half-eaten rations, suddenly felt like a chain. [243]
He fumbled with the straps, his fingers stiff, and let it fall into the snow. [258]
The moment it hit, the world tilted. [263]

The spire’s entrance—a jagged maw of ice—rippled like water. [275]
Elias stepped through and found himself in a mist so thick it clung to his skin, not wet, but *alive*. [296]
He had heard of *mist walking*, a lost art where the traveler dissolved into vapor, but he’d never dared try it. [321]
Now, the mist pulled at him, and he let it. [333]
His body unraveled, thread by thread, until he was nothing but thought adrift in the gray. [353]

When he reformed, he stood in a courtyard of black glass, the sky above a swirl of stars that moved like schools of fish. [381]
At the center, a fountain bubbled with liquid light, and beside it, a figure in tattered robes—another mage, or perhaps a reflection of himself. [412]
"You’re late," the figure said. [417]
Elias swallowed. "I didn’t know I was expected." [428]
The figure laughed, a sound like wind through dead leaves. "No one does, until they *unstrap* their expectations." [451]
Elias looked down. [454]
His hands were translucent, his edges flickering. [464]

The figure gestured to the fountain. "Drink. It’s the last of the old magic—before the machines took over, before everything became *efficient*." [496]
Elias hesitated, then cupped his hands and drank. [508]
The light burned, not painfully, but like waking up. [520]
Memories surfaced: his first failed spell, the way his mentor had sighed, the quiet shame of being passed over for promotions. [550]
But beneath that, something else—a spark, a *knowing*. [562]

"You’re not an underachiever," the figure said. "You’re a slow learner. There’s a difference." [582]
Elias wanted to argue, but the words died in his throat. [594]
The courtyard faded, the mist swallowing him again. [604]
This time, when he emerged, he was back at the spire’s base, his satchel at his feet, the garden folly keystone dark. [630]
But his hands were solid. [634]
And in his palm, a single drop of liquid light. [645]

He didn’t cast a grand spell. [650]
Instead, he knelt and pressed the drop into the snow. [662]
Where it touched, a flower bloomed—not ice, not frost, but a real, living thing, petals glowing with the same *lingering luminance* as the spire. [697]
Elias smiled. [700]
He had come seeking the sacred, but the sacred had been in the simple all along. [720]
The spire’s light flickered above him, as if in approval. [732]

He stood, brushing snow from his robes, and began the long walk down. [746]
Behind him, the flower pulsed, a tiny star in the endless white. [761]
