The loft’s rain-beaded skylight cast shifting prisms across the floor, each droplet refracting the dim afternoon light into fleeting constellations. [19]
Lira Veyne adjusted the frayed cuff of her sleeve, her fingers brushing the onyx-ink stains that never quite washed out. [38]
She had spent the last three years since the cryptocurrency crashes tracing the collapse not through ledgers, but through the stories people told afterward—the way they measured loss in metaphors, not zeros. [76]
Her measuring tape, coiled like a sleeping serpent on the workbench, was her most trusted tool, though not for distances. [97]
She used it to chart the spaces between words, the gaps in narratives where truth frayed at the edges. [119]

Tonight, she was reverse engineering a deck of cards. [127]
Not in the way most would think—she wasn’t dismantling them to copy their design, but to unravel the cultural patterns woven into their symbols. [153]
The deck had been mailed to her anonymously, its origins as murky as the ink that bled from its edges when wet. [175]
Lira had spent the morning pressing the cards between sheets of blotting paper, watching as the images blurred into abstract smears, as if the past itself resisted clarity. [208]

She was steadily curious, a trait that had both saved and doomed her in equal measure. [225]
It was why she’d become a cartomancer, though not the kind who claimed to see futures. [242]
No, she read the present through the debris of the past, the way a geologist might study strata to understand a quake. [263]
The deck before her was no different—a sedimentary record of someone’s fears, hopes, or perhaps their attempt to rewrite history. [287]

The first card she turned over was The Tower, its lightning-struck spire rendered in ink that shimmered like oil on water. [310]
Lira ran the measuring tape along its edges, noting how the proportions were slightly off, as if the artist had stretched the image to fit an unseen frame. [340]
She murmured to herself, a habit when the weight of a mystery pressed too hard. [356]
“Someone’s trying to warn me. Or test me.” [366]

Her phone buzzed, the screen illuminating a message from an unknown number: *You’re close. Keep multiplying the paths.* [389]
Lira exhaled through her nose, the inherited mystery of her work settling over her like a second skin. [413]
She had learned long ago that the most dangerous secrets weren’t the ones buried, but the ones left in plain sight, waiting for someone to notice the seams. [448]

The next card was The Fool, but this version was different—no dog nipping at his heels, no cliff’s edge. [468]
Instead, the figure stood in a field of broken chains, his pack spilling coins that dissolved into birds midair. [490]
Lira’s pulse quickened. [494]
The cryptocurrency crashes had left more than financial ruin; they’d shattered the illusion of control, and here it was, encoded in ink. [525]

She confided in the silence then, as she often did when the weight of a discovery threatened to unmoor her. [547]
“You’re not just mapping patterns,” she whispered to the empty loft. [559]
“You’re being mapped.” [563]

The third card was The Hermit, but his lantern glowed with a light that wasn’t fire—it was static, the kind that flickered on old televisions after broadcast ended. [598]
Lira traced the measuring tape along the lantern’s edge, her breath shallow. [616]
This wasn’t a warning. It was an invitation. [626]

She spread the remaining cards across the workbench, multiplying the paths as the message had instructed. [647]
The Hanged Man dangled from a noose of barbed wire. [657]
Justice held scales tipped with shattered glass. [666]
The World was a cracked orb, continents drifting apart like puzzle pieces. [683]

Lira’s hands trembled as she arranged them in a circle, the rain outside picking up rhythm against the skylight. [707]
The deck wasn’t just a record—it was a blueprint. [718]
Someone had reverse engineered the future, stitching it together from the fragments of what had already failed. [742]

She reached for her phone, thumb hovering over the unknown number. [755]
If she replied, she’d be stepping into the map. [767]
If she didn’t, she’d spend the rest of her life wondering what lay at its center. [788]

Lira sent a single word: *How?* [793]

The reply came instantly: *By measuring what’s left.* [805]
