The workshop groaned like a dying beast, its iron bones creaking as the acid sea below licked at the rusted struts. [16]
Elias the alchemist clutched his key ring, the brass charm—a tiny, cracked vial—biting into his palm. [34]
He wasn’t sure if the liquid inside was still mercury or if it had long since evaporated into the workshop’s damp, metallic air. [61]
This uncertainty had become his constant companion, a shadow that stretched longer with each failed experiment. [83]

The statue loomed in the corner, its stone face pockmarked with centuries of neglect. [99]
Elias had found it half-submerged in the acid sea, its hollow eyes staring up at him like twin voids. [121]
He traced the pockmarks with his fingers, matching their patterns to the scars on his own arms—each one a memory he’d tried to stitch together, like a quilt of half-remembered dreams. [155]
The workshop’s gears turned with a slow, grinding rhythm, as if the world itself was holding its breath. [175]

He had come here to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion, to find something—anything—that would make sense of the fragments. [199]
The acid sea hissed below, its fumes curling around the workshop’s edges like spectral fingers. [218]
Elias exhaled, his lungs burning as if he’d been holding his breath underwater, though he hadn’t moved in hours. [241]

The key ring charm jingled as he turned it over in his hand. [254]
It was the last thing his mentor had given him before the workshop’s previous owner vanished into the acid sea, his body dissolving into the same nothingness Elias feared. [287]
Kintsugi intentions, the old man had called it—the art of repairing what was broken, not to hide the cracks, but to gild them in gold. [316]
Elias had never mastered it. [323]

He knelt before the statue, pressing his forehead against its cold stone. [338]
The pockmarks aligned with the scars on his skin, each one a story he couldn’t quite narrate. [359]
There was the time he’d mixed the wrong reagents and nearly burned the workshop down. [377]
The night he’d stood at the edge of the platform, staring into the acid sea, wondering if it would hurt to let go. [405]
The morning he’d woken to find his mentor’s tools scattered, his notes soaked in brine, his last words erased by time. [435]

The gears above him stuttered, and the workshop tilted slightly, as if the world was shifting beneath him. [458]
Elias gripped the statue, his breath shallow. [468]
He had to make sense of it—had to find the thread that connected the pockmarks to the scars to the memories he couldn’t piece together. [499]
The acid sea roared below, a reminder of how easily everything could dissolve. [518]

Then he saw it. [522]
One of the pockmarks on the statue’s cheek matched a scar on his wrist—a jagged line from the night he’d tried to fix the workshop’s failing engine. [556]
Another, near the statue’s temple, mirrored the burn on his forearm from the time he’d spilled molten gold. [583]
The patterns weren’t random. [588]
They were a map. [592]

Elias scrambled for his notes, his hands shaking. [603]
If the pockmarks were memories, then the statue wasn’t just a relic—it was a vessel. [625]
A vessel for the things he’d lost, the things he’d tried to forget. [641]
The key ring charm glinted in the dim light, its cracked vial now glowing faintly, as if something inside had finally awoken. [670]

He pressed the charm to the statue’s chest, where the pockmarks formed a perfect circle. [691]
The workshop shuddered, the gears whirring faster, the acid sea churning below. [710]
Elias closed his eyes, his breath held like a diver poised between the surface and the deep. [732]
He began to narrate—not in words, but in the language of scars and pockmarks, of gold and acid, of things broken and things mended. [762]

The statue’s stone skin split, not with violence, but with purpose, its cracks filling with liquid gold. [787]
Elias gasped as the memories flooded back—not as fragments, but as a whole, a quilt stitched together with threads of light. [816]
The workshop steadied, the gears humming in harmony, the acid sea calming beneath them. [830]
