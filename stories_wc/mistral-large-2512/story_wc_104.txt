The carnival had been dead for years, its rides rusted into skeletal silence, but the prize redemption center still smelled of stale popcorn and spilled soda. [22]
Mira crouched behind the counter, her wrists raw from the iron cuffs that bound her to the liberator’s chain. [44]
He called himself Vey, though she doubted it was his real name—men who freed prisoners in the dark didn’t keep real names. [72]
The arrow had come first, lodged in the plywood wall above the stuffed-animal bins, its fletching woven from what looked like dried grass and wire. [102]
Vey had plucked it free without a word, turning it in his fingers like a man reading a message. [124]

“They’re marking the vault,” he said at last, voice low. [134]
Mira had heard rumors of the seed vault, buried beneath the old Ferris wheel’s foundation, a trove of drought-resistant life hidden from the regime that had salted the earth. [168]
But the regime was crumbling now, its walls cracking under the weight of its own hunger, and the scavengers were circling. [194]
Vey’s job was to get there first. [203]
Hers was to survive long enough to help. [212]

The piano bench sat in the corner, its lid warped by years of humidity. [229]
Vey flipped it open to reveal a scatter of keys—brass, iron, even a few made of bone—arranged in no order Mira could discern. [254]
“They left us a puzzle,” he murmured, tracing the keys with his fingertips. [270]
She watched as he began to sort them, not by size or shape, but by the faint notches carved into their bows, like musical notes. [296]
The first key fit the cuffs at her wrists. [306]
The second unlocked the padlock on the back door. [316]
By the time he reached the third, Mira understood: the keys were a map, their arrangement a melody only the patiently strategic could hear. [350]

Outside, the carnival grounds were a maze of toppled game stalls and collapsed tents. [368]
Vey moved like a shadow, but Mira’s chains clinked with every step, a sound that made her teeth ache. [390]
They were halfway to the Ferris wheel when the scavengers found them. [406]
A man with a machete stepped from behind a cotton-candy kiosk, grinning. [425]
Vey didn’t draw his knife. [432]
Instead, he held up the arrow, its strange fletching catching the dim light. [450]
“You don’t want to impede us,” he said, and though his voice was quiet, the man hesitated. [472]
Mira saw the recognition in his eyes—the arrow was a warning, a boundary line drawn by those who had already claimed the vault. [502]

The scavenger spat but stepped aside. [511]
Vey didn’t thank him. [516]
They reached the Ferris wheel’s base as the first tremors shook the ground. [532]
Not an earthquake—something heavier, something deliberate. [543]
The wall was coming down. [550]

The vault’s entrance was a steel door set into the concrete, its lock a monstrous thing of gears and teeth. [574]
Vey knelt, sifting through the keys until he found the one that fit. [590]
The door groaned open, revealing a staircase descending into darkness. [606]
Mira’s breath hitched. [612]
Inside, shelves lined the walls, each holding jars of seeds—some plump and golden, others shriveled but alive. [640]
Vey handed her a burlap sack. [647]
“Take what you can carry,” he said. [655]
“But not too much.” [660]
She understood: resilience wasn’t about hoarding. [671]
It was about planting. [675]

Above them, the carnival shuddered as the wall collapsed in the distance, the sound like a dying beast’s roar. [701]
Vey closed the vault behind them, locking it with the last key. [716]
“They’ll find it eventually,” Mira said. [725]
“Not before we’ve spread the seeds,” he replied. [737]
She thought of the dry soil beyond the carnival, of the people who had given up on green things. [762]
The arrow’s message was clear now: the time for hiding was over. [782]
The time for growing had begun. [791]

They stepped into the dawn, the chains at Mira’s wrists lighter now, as if the weight of hope had already begun to unravel them. [824]
