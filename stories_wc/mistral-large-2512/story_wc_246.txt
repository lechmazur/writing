The gravitational anomaly had settled into the town like a second moon, pulling at the edges of reality just enough to make the air shimmer with possibilities. [22]
Liora Vey, the town’s only celestial signal interpreter, adjusted the straps of her satchel as she stepped onto the cracked pavement of the old plaza. [48]
The dried-up fountain pen in her pocket was a relic from her mentor, its exotic nib still sharp despite the ink long since evaporated. [78]
She carried it not for writing, but as a reminder—some truths were better left half-formed, their edges unbent by certainty. [109]

It had been three years since she’d planted the wrong seeds in the town’s collective memory. [130]
The mistake had been subtle: a misinterpreted signal, a misplaced decimal in the celestial coordinates, a ripple that had warped the way the townsfolk remembered their own past. [162]
Now, history was a draft in need of editing, and Liora was the only one who knew how to wield the red pen. [187]

Her confidence was a fragile thing, a performance she maintained through contingent relationships—leaning on the baker’s steady hands when hers shook, trusting the librarian’s sharp eyes to catch what she missed. [225]
Alone, she was uncertain; together, they were a force. [237]
The anomaly made it easier, distorting time just enough that cause and effect blurred like watercolors. [261]
A misstep today could be erased tomorrow, if she was careful. [276]

The plaza’s centerpiece was a fountain that had run dry decades ago, its basin now a nest for stray cats. [299]
Liora sat on its edge, pulling out the pen and turning it over in her fingers. [321]
The nib was made of a metal she’d never seen before, its surface etched with symbols that shifted when viewed from different angles. [349]
She’d tried to write with it once, years ago, but the ink had bled into the paper like a living thing, rewriting the words before her eyes. [380]
Since then, she’d kept it close, a talisman against the chaos of her own mind. [402]

A shadow fell across her lap. [411]
“You’re early,” she said without looking up. [418]
The baker, Elias, settled beside her, his apron dusted with flour. [434]
“Or late,” he replied, nodding at the anomaly. [443]
It hung low today, a bruise-colored smear in the sky, pulsing like a slow heartbeat. [464]
“Depends on which version of the day you’re living.” [478]

Liora exhaled, her breath fogging in the unnatural chill. [491]
“Last night, I dreamed of the signal again,” she said. [506]
“The one that started all this.” [514]
Elias didn’t ask which signal—he knew. [523]
They all did, in some way. [530]
The town’s memories were a patchwork, stitched together from half-truths and convenient lies. [551]
But the dream had been different. [558]
Clearer. [560]
As if the anomaly was trying to show her something. [574]

“Maybe it’s time to unbend a little,” Elias said, nudging her shoulder. [594]
“Maybe the truth isn’t something we carve in stone. [611]
Maybe it’s something we grow.” [619]

Liora turned the pen over again, the exotic nib catching the light. [635]
She thought of the seeds she’d planted, the ones that had taken root in the wrong soil. [656]
The town’s history was a garden overgrown with weeds, but even weeds had meaning if you knew how to thresh it from the chaff. [689]

“What if I make it worse?” she asked. [702]
Elias smiled, his face creasing with strange comfort. [714]
“Then we’ll plant new seeds.” [722]

The anomaly pulsed again, and for a moment, the air smelled like ozone and fresh bread. [744]
Liora slipped the pen back into her pocket, its weight familiar and strange all at once. [765]
She stood, brushing dust from her knees. [776]
The past wasn’t a fixed thing—it was a draft, and she was the editor. [796]
All she had to do was decide what to keep. [808]
[810]
