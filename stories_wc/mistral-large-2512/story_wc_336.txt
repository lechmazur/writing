The waterfall whispered secrets to the moss below, its voice a silver thread woven through the hush of budding hope. [16]
On the verdant parapet beside it, old Maren knelt, her fingers tracing the bark of the ancient apple tree as if reading braille. [38]
She was the orchard’s pruner, wise in the way of wounds and growth, her hands calloused from decades of coaxing life from gnarled branches. [68]
Today, though, her task was different—she had come to succor the last heirloom seed, a relic of a tree that had once borne fruit like rubies. [98]

The seed lay in her palm, no larger than a tear, its hull etched with faint, spiraling patterns that seemed to shift when she blinked. [129]
Maren had found it nestled in the split trunk of the dead tree, preserved by some miracle of sap and time. [152]
She knew what it was: a bridge, a thread weaving between worlds, though she did not yet understand how. [176]
Her insatiably creative mind had already begun to unravel the mystery, stitching together fragments of old stories—how the first orchard had been planted by travelers from a land where trees grew upside-down, their roots drinking starlight. [221]

The seed pulsed faintly, as if in agreement. [230]
Maren exhaled, her breath curling around it like a promise. [244]
To preserve the color of wonder—that was why she had come. [257]
Not just the red of the apples, but the way the light had danced through them, turning the orchard into a cathedral of gold and crimson. [287]
The world was forgetting such things, she thought, as the waterfall’s mist kissed her cheeks. [310]

She pressed the seed into the soil at the parapet’s edge, where the earth was rich with the waterfall’s runoff. [336]
Then she began to sing, not in words, but in hums that vibrated through her bones, a melody she had learned from the trees themselves. [364]
The method was simple, though few knew it: by capturing essence, she could call forth what was lost. [388]
The song was the thread, the seed the needle, and the world beyond the veil the tapestry waiting to be mended. [418]

The ground trembled. [421]
A shoot burst forth, delicate as a newborn’s finger, its leaves unfurling in shades of emerald that had not been seen in generations. [454]
Maren’s heart swelled, but she did not stop singing. [467]
The waterfall’s roar softened, as if listening, and the air hummed with something older than memory. [491]

Then she saw them—the others. [496]
Not people, but echoes, fragments of the travelers who had planted the first tree. [520]
They flickered at the edges of her vision, their forms woven from mist and longing. [541]
One reached out, and where their fingers brushed the shoot, the leaves deepened to the ruby red of the lost apples. [571]
Maren understood then: the seed was not just a bridge, but a vessel, holding the essence of a world that had faded like dye in rain. [609]

She sang louder, her voice threading through the gaps between here and there. [630]
The shoot grew, its branches spiraling upward, and with each new leaf, the air shimmered with colors that had no name. [662]
The travelers’ echoes solidified, their laughter ringing like wind chimes in the hush. [684]
They were not ghosts, Maren realized, but seeds themselves—waiting to be planted in the soil of the living. [713]

When the first bud appeared, its petals a swirl of gold and crimson, she knew she had succeeded. [737]
The color of wonder was not lost; it had only been sleeping. [752]
The waterfall’s mist curled around the new tree, as if welcoming it home. [770]
Maren sat back, her hands trembling with the weight of what she had done. [789]
The orchard would live again, and with it, the stories that had once made the world bright. [814]
She closed her eyes, listening to the radiant hush, and smiled. [829]
