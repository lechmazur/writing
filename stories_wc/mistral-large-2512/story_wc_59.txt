The suspended palace of Veythari hung like a forgotten dream from the cavern’s ceiling, its gilded towers swaying gently on chains thicker than ancient oaks. [23]
Prince Kaelen, once radiant in embroidered silks, now dragged his tattered cloak through the dust-choked halls, his fingers trembling not from cold but from the weight of his own failure. [58]
The world below had long since abandoned beauty, replacing it with gears and smoke, and Kaelen had sworn to undo it—or die trying. [87]

His chambers were a shrine to what had been: pressed flowers beneath cracked glass, a lute missing three strings, and, resting on a velvet cushion, the egg. [120]
It was no larger than his palm, its shell a swirl of iridescent blues and golds, colors that seemed to shift when he wasn’t looking. [147]
The last egg of the *Luminis*, a bird whose song had once summoned dawn itself, before the machines choked the sky. [173]
Kaelen had found it in the ruins of a forgotten aviary, nestled in the skeletal hands of a statue that had once held a lyre. [199]
The egg was cold, but he refused to believe it dead. [213]

That night, as the palace groaned under the strain of its own weight, Kaelen lit a single candle and began to assemble. [238]
From the depths of his trunk, he pulled a brass contraption—half music box, half furnace—its gears salvaged from the wreckage of a clockmaker’s shop. [268]
He had spent years hypothesizing about everything: the exact pitch of the *Luminis*’ song, the temperature of its nest, the way its feathers had once caught the light like liquid gold. [307]
If the egg could be coaxed to life, perhaps the world would remember what it had lost. [326]
Perhaps it would remember *him*. [333]

The first attempt was a disaster. [338]
He wound the contraption too tight, and the resulting melody was a screeching, metallic parody of what he’d imagined. [358]
The egg shuddered, then lay still. [364]
Kaelen’s breath hitched, his hands shaking as he adjusted the gears, recalibrated the heat. [384]
The palace creaked around him, the stalactites above groaning like old men burdened by time. [407]

On the third night, he tried again, this time humming along to the contraption’s halting tune. [432]
The egg warmed. [435]
A hairline crack appeared, then another, and for a heartbeat, Kaelen dared to hope. [458]
But the shell did not part. [464]
Instead, a single, mournful note escaped—bitterly sweet, like the last sigh of a dying star. [488]
The sound coiled around him, and for the first time in years, Kaelen wept. [509]

He understood then the flaw in his genesis. [520]
The *Luminis* had not been born of machinery, but of magic—of belief, of longing, of something the mechanical world had crushed beneath its wheels. [553]
The egg was not a thing to be *assembled* into existence; it was a thing to be *remembered* into it. [577]

With trembling fingers, Kaelen set aside the contraption. [591]
He cupped the egg in his palms and whispered the old stories, the ones his mother had told him before the factories swallowed the sky. [623]
He sang the lullabies of his childhood, off-key and broken, but true. [642]
And as he did, the cracks in the egg glowed, faint at first, then brighter, until the entire shell pulsed with light. [675]

Through the discovery, Kaelen did not move. [686]
He barely breathed as the shell split, not with the violence of hatching, but with the slow, inevitable grace of a flower unfurling. [720]
A beak emerged, then a head, then—oh, then—wings, their edges still damp with the remnants of the egg’s dream. [750]
The *Luminis* opened its eyes, and Kaelen saw in them the reflection of a world that had once been, and might be again. [783]
The bird did not sing. [788]
Not yet. [790]
But it leaned into his touch, and Kaelen knew, with a certainty that shook him to his core, that beauty was not gone. [824]
It had only been waiting. [829]
