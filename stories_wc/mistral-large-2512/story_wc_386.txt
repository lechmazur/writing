The first time Mara saw the wreck, it was through the melted snow globe. [12]
It sat on the altar of the candle-lit shrine carved into glacier ice, its glass fogged and warped, the tiny figurine inside—once a diver, now a blur—fused to the base. [40]
She had come to this place because whispers said the dead lingered in the ice, and Mara was a wreck-diver ghost whisperer, though she preferred the term "salvager of echoes." [72]
The shrine was her office, her confessional, her last hope. [80]

She cupped the snow globe in her palms, feeling the residual warmth of the fire that had melted it. [96]
The heat had come from a lantern dropped by a grieving widow years ago, or so the stories went. [113]
Mara didn’t believe in accidents. [116]
She believed in windows of connection—thin places where the living and the lost could brush against each other if you knew how to look. [143]
The snow globe was one such window. [149]

That night, she dreamed of a ship breaking apart in the dark. [159]
Not just any ship—the *SS Marigold*, a passenger liner lost in the 1920s, its hull split open by ice. [178]
In the dream, she stood on the deck, watching strangers move through the wreckage like ghosts themselves. [195]
But one figure didn’t belong. [200]
A woman in a red coat, her face obscured by steam, turned toward Mara and smiled. [217]
"Find the cameo," she said. [222]

Mara woke with a start, her breath fogging the shrine’s icy walls. [233]
She weaves truth carefully, never rushing, never assuming. [240]
If the dream was a message, it wasn’t the first. [248]
For years, she’d been analyzing cameo appearances in strangers’ dreams—fleeting glimpses of the dead, slipping into the minds of the living like thieves. [273]
The red-coated woman had appeared before, always in fragments, always just out of reach. [289]
This time, Mara would expose her. [295]

She lit a candle and pressed her forehead to the ice, murmuring the names of the *Marigold*’s dead. [314]
The shrine hummed in response, the glacier’s ancient breath whispering back. [327]
Mara had learned long ago that the dead didn’t speak in words. [339]
They spoke in symbols, in the way a stranger’s dream suddenly filled with saltwater, in the way a child drew a ship they’d never seen. [363]
The red-coated woman was a symbol too, Mara realized. [373]
A warning. [375]

She spent the next week tracking down survivors’ descendants, those who carried the wreck in their blood. [394]
One by one, she visited them, listening to their dreams, searching for the cameo. [410]
A baker in Reykjavik dreamed of drowning in a hallway of doors. [422]
A fisherman in Nuuk saw a woman in red waving from a porthole. [437]
A librarian in Oslo woke screaming, her sheets damp with imaginary seawater. [453]
Mara collected these fragments like shards of glass, fitting them together until the picture became clear. [473]

The red-coated woman wasn’t a victim. [479]
She was the ship’s quartermaster, the one who’d locked the passengers below deck to save the lifeboats. [499]
The *Marigold* hadn’t sunk by accident. [506]
It had been sabotaged. [510]

Mara returned to the shrine, the snow globe now cold in her hands. [524]
She had come to salvage something pure from the wreckage, but all she’d found was another layer of ruin. [543]
The dead didn’t want justice. [548]
They wanted silence. [551]

She placed the snow globe back on the altar, its melted form a testament to what happens when truth burns too bright. [575]
The shrine flickered with candlelight, the ice groaning as if in relief. [589]
Mara exhaled, her breath curling into the dark. [598]
Some windows of connection should stay closed. [606]

But as she turned to leave, the snow globe’s surface rippled. [618]
A single drop of water slid down its side, catching the light like a tear. [634]
The red-coated woman stood inside, her face no longer obscured. [646]
"You found me," she said. [651]

Mara didn’t flinch. [654]
"Was it worth it?" she asked. [659]

The woman’s smile was sad. [664]
"Ask the ones who lived." [670]

Then the snow globe went dark. [676]
The shrine fell silent. [681]
Mara walked out into the borrowed starlight, the truth woven carefully into her bones. [698]
She would never tell. [702]
Some wrecks were meant to stay buried. [710]
[711]
