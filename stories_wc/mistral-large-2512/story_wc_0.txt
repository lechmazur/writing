The greenhouse stood crooked, its glass panes cracked like spiderwebs after the flood. [12]
Dr. Elara Voss adjusted her gloves, the latex sticking to her fingers as she brushed a thumb over the dust collected on the workbench. [33]
It wasn’t just any dust—it was the residue of a butterfly’s wing, harvested months ago from a specimen preserved in the university’s archives. [57]
She had preprocessed the sample herself, treating it with a solution that slowed decay, though not indefinitely. [75]
The storm had accelerated everything. [79]

Elara was a neutron star researcher by trade, accustomed to studying objects so dense they warped time itself. [99]
But here, in this storm-damaged greenhouse, she was learning something quieter: how small things accumulated until they became undeniable. [124]
The dust patterns on the bench weren’t random. [130]
They settled in delicate arcs, like the faintest echo of the wing’s original structure. [146]
She traced one with her fingertip, feeling the grit beneath the glove. [157]

The flood had stripped the greenhouse of its purpose. [165]
Once, it had been a place of growth, of controlled experiments with light and water. [180]
Now, it was a skeleton of its former self, its metal ribs bent, its soil washed away. [195]
Elara had come here to escape the noise of the university, the endless debates about funding and prestige. [213]
She wanted to strip needless drama from her work, to focus on what mattered: the slow, inevitable shift of things. [235]

The dust was proof of gradual change. [241]
Each particle had drifted, settling not by chance but by the pull of air currents, the weight of its own existence. [261]
She had read about butterfly wings altering weather patterns, their scales scattering sunlight in ways that could, over time, steer storms. [285]
This dust was a fragment of that power, a whisper of influence. [297]

Elara knelt, her knees pressing into the damp wood of the bench. [308]
She had set up a microscope before the flood, its lenses still intact despite the chaos. [322]
Peering through it now, she saw the dust not as debris but as a map. [337]
The patterns formed constellations, miniature galaxies of decay. [347]
It was humbling, this realization that even the smallest things left traces. [360]

She thought of neutron stars, how their collapse was both violent and silent, how their gravity bent light itself. [381]
Here, in this broken greenhouse, the dust bent nothing—but it persisted. [395]
It was a kind of gravity, too, the way it clung to surfaces, the way it refused to be ignored. [416]

Elara exhaled, her breath disturbing a cluster of particles. [426]
She had spent years chasing the dramatic: black holes, supernovae, the birth and death of stars. [447]
But the flood had washed away the noise, leaving only this—dust, decay, the quiet proof of time. [467]
She didn’t need drama. [471]
She needed to see the world as it was: a place where even the most fragile things left their mark. [494]

The greenhouse creaked in the wind, its glass groaning like a ship at sea. [509]
Elara didn’t flinch. [512]
She was used to storms, to the way they peeled back layers, revealing what lay beneath. [534]
The dust on her bench was just another layer, one she was learning to read. [550]

She reached for her notebook, its pages warped from the flood. [561]
With a pencil, she sketched the patterns, her hand steady despite the damp. [576]
This was her new research: not the collapse of stars, but the slow accumulation of what remained. [598]
The dust was teaching her humility. [604]
It didn’t demand attention; it simply was. [612]

Outside, the sky darkened again, the promise of more rain. [623]
Elara didn’t move. [626]
She was where she needed to be, in the quiet after the storm, watching the world preprocess itself into something new. [652]
The dust would keep falling. [657]
And she would keep watching. [662]
