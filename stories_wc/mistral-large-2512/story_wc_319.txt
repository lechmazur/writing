The frozen garden stretched before Mara like a dream half-remembered, its skeletal trees clawing at the mist that curled between their branches. [18]
She had come here seeking answers, though she wasn’t sure what the questions were anymore. [31]
The air smelled of damp earth and old parchment, a scent that clung to her skin like a second shadow. [51]
Somewhere in this labyrinth of frost and silence, the feral library guardian waited. [67]

Mara had heard the stories—how the guardian was neither beast nor human, but something in between, a creature of ink and instinct that prowled the stacks of a library no one could find. [103]
It was said to protect knowledge too dangerous for waking minds, hoarding secrets in the dark like a dragon with its gold. [128]
She adjusted the cultist’s pendant around her neck, its weight a cold reminder of why she had come. [148]
The pendant had been a gift—or a curse—from a man who spoke of "the boundaries of light" as if they were doors waiting to be opened. [178]
Now, as the mist thickened around her, Mara wondered if she had already stepped through one. [198]

She had been dimensionally homesick for as long as she could remember, a longing for a place that didn’t exist, or perhaps existed only in fragments. [229]
The garden felt like one of those fragments, a sliver of somewhere else bleeding into this world. [250]
She exhaled, watching her breath curl into the cold like a question without an answer. [270]
To make friends with uncertainty—that had been her motivation for years, though she hadn’t known it until now. [291]
Uncertainty was the only constant in her life, the only thing that never lied to her. [310]

A sound like pages turning whispered through the mist. [323]
Mara turned, her boots crunching on frost-laced grass. [335]
The feral library guardian stood between two frozen hedges, its form shifting in the dim light—part child, part shadow, all teeth and ink-stained fingers. [368]
It watched her with eyes that held entire galaxies, or perhaps just the reflection of her own fear. [389]
"You’ve been waiting," it said, its voice like paper tearing. [401]

Mara nodded, though she hadn’t realized it until that moment. [413]
She had been waiting her whole life, waiting for something to make sense, for the world to stop feeling like a puzzle with missing pieces. [444]
The guardian tilted its head, studying the pendant around her neck. [459]
"That’s not yours," it murmured. [464]
"No," Mara admitted. [466]
"But it brought me here." [472]

The guardian smiled, if the stretching of its lips could be called a smile. [487]
"Then it served its purpose." [494]
It beckoned her forward, and Mara followed, the mist swallowing her steps as if she were walking through the veil of sleep. [527]
The garden seemed to expand around her, the trees growing taller, the paths multiplying like veins. [550]
She understood then what the cultist had meant by interiorizing exteriors—this place was not just a garden, but a mind, a memory, a wound in the world. [586]

The guardian led her to a clearing where a single book lay open on the frost. [606]
Its pages were blank, but when Mara looked closer, she saw words forming under her gaze, ink bleeding into existence like blood from a cut. [638]
"You write what you fear," the guardian said. [648]
"And what you fear writes you back." [657]

Mara hesitated, then knelt, her fingers brushing the page. [670]
The words that appeared were her own, though she didn’t remember writing them: *I am homesick for a place I’ve never been.* [699]
The pendant around her neck grew colder, its edges sharp against her skin. [717]
The guardian’s voice was soft now, almost kind. [728]
"Some boundaries are meant to be crossed." [739]
"But not all of them should be." [747]

Mara looked up, but the guardian was gone, leaving only the whisper of pages turning in the mist. [768]
She stood, the book now closed, its cover blank again. [780]
The garden was still frozen, still silent, but something had shifted. [795]
She wasn’t sure what she had found, or if she had found anything at all. [811]
But for the first time, she didn’t feel the need to wait. [825]
[826]
