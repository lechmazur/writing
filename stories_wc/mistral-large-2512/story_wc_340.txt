The elevator groaned as it ascended the icebound spire, its brass gears straining against the weight of the servant girl clinging to the railing. [19]
Lira had been ascending for years—first as a scullery maid, then a chamber assistant, and now, improbably, as the personal aide to the airship captain herself. [46]
The goggles resting on her collarbone, borrowed without permission, were heavy with significance; their lenses, cracked from an old crash, still held the faint scent of engine oil and salt. [76]
She traced a finger along the leather strap, wondering what secrets they had witnessed in the skies. [92]

The diary had appeared that morning, slipped beneath her door like a whisper. [105]
Its cover was worn, the lock broken, and the pages filled with a cipher she couldn’t decipher—yet. [121]
Lira had always been warmly inquisitive, the kind of person who noticed the way the cook’s hands shook when she thought no one was looking, or how the captain’s laughter never quite reached her eyes. [153]
This diary, though, felt different. It wasn’t just another puzzle; it was a promise. [169]

The elevator lurched to a stop at the tenth floor, its doors hissing open to reveal the captain’s private quarters. [187]
Lira stepped inside, the cold biting through her thin slippers. [196]
The room was a shrine to flight: maps pinned to the walls, half-empty bottles of whiskey, and a model airship suspended from the ceiling, its sails catching the pale light filtering through the frosted windows. [232]
She moved toward the desk, where the diary lay open, its pages shifting slightly as if breathing. [250]

To unfold its meaning, she knew she’d have to look through scattered light. [264]
Lira held the diary up to the window, angling it until the sun’s rays pierced the ice, refracting through the glass and casting jagged patterns across the pages. [292]
The cipher resolved itself—not in words, but in sketches: a woman’s face, a shattered airship, a child’s hand reaching. [316]
Her breath caught. [320]

The captain had lost her daughter in the crash that cracked those goggles. [335]
The diary wasn’t just encrypted; it was a confession, a love letter to a joy buried beneath layers of anguish. [354]
Lira’s fingers trembled as she turned the pages, each one revealing more of the captain’s hidden grief. [373]

She had come here seeking answers, but now she wondered if she was intruding on something sacred. [392]
The elevator’s gears whirred below, a reminder that the world kept moving, indifferent to the weight of these revelations. [416]
Yet Lira couldn’t look away. [422]

The captain’s voice cut through her thoughts, sharp and unexpected. [436]
“You always were too curious for your own good.” [448]
Lira spun around, the diary clutched to her chest. [457]
The captain stood in the doorway, her expression unreadable, though her eyes flickered to the goggles around Lira’s neck. [480]

“I—I found this,” Lira stammered, holding out the diary. [491]
The captain didn’t take it. [496]
Instead, she stepped forward, her boots clicking against the ice-slicked floor. [511]
“Some things aren’t meant to be unfolded,” she said softly. [524]

Lira swallowed. [527]
“But what if joy is hiding beneath the pain?” [538]
The captain’s gaze softened, just for a moment, before she turned away. [553]
“Then you risk tearing it all apart.” [562]

The elevator chimed again, signaling another ascent. [573]
Lira hesitated, then placed the diary on the desk. [583]
The goggles felt heavier than ever as she unclasped them from her neck and set them beside it. [604]
“I’ll leave you to your memories,” she murmured. [614]

The captain didn’t stop her as she walked away. [624]
But as the elevator doors closed, Lira saw her pick up the diary, her fingers tracing the sketches with a tenderness that made Lira’s heart ache. [655]

She had sought the joy beneath anguish, but perhaps some things were meant to remain folded. [678]
The spire stretched above her, its icebound peaks glowing in the fading light. [697]
Lira pressed her palm against the cold glass, wondering if the captain would ever let herself see the sun through scattered light again. [730]

The elevator climbed, and the world outside blurred into a haze of white and gold. [747]
Some secrets, she realized, were not hers to unfold. [759]
