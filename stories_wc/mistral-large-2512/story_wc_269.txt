The station hummed with the low pulse of machinery, its walls lined with flickering monitors that tracked the slow rise of the sea. [16]
Dr. Elara Voss stood at the window, watching the water lap against the reinforced glass, her fingers tapping an absent rhythm against the metal sill. [43]
She had come here to witness the aftermath of coral bleaching, to document the fragile ecosystems clinging to survival after the fossil fuel ban had finally taken hold. [80]
But the data was incomplete—some of the old survey paths had vanished from the records, as if they had never existed at all. [106]

Her boots echoed in the empty hallway as she made her way to the archives, the air thick with the scent of salt and old paper. [131]
The station’s records were supposed to be exhaustive, but when she pulled the atlas from its shelf, a page was torn out. [156]
The missing section had mapped the very reefs she’d been sent to study, the ones that had once thrived before the oceans turned against them. [185]
Elara traced the jagged edge of the tear, her pulse quickening. [198]

That night, she dreamed of the sea. [205]
Not as it was now—murky, shifting, full of ghosts—but as it had been before, when the corals still bloomed in vibrant defiance. [233]
In the dream, she walked along a path that dissolved beneath her feet, the water swallowing the way forward before she could reach the end. [263]
She woke with a start, her fingers still tapping the rhythm of the tide against the bedframe. [282]

The station’s AI, a relic from the pre-ban era, flickered to life as she approached. [299]
"Query: Why do some paths disappear?" she asked, her voice steady despite the unease coiling in her chest. [326]
The machine whirred, its screen displaying a single line: *Insufficient data. Consult historical records.* [349]
Elara exhaled. [352]

She spent the next three days assembling fragments—old logs, half-erased coordinates, the torn atlas page she’d found tucked into a maintenance manual. [383]
The station’s staff had long since rotated out, leaving only the periodic hum of the tide gauges and the occasional crackle of static over the comms. [415]
It was as if time here moved differently, stretched thin between the eternal rise and fall of the waves. [442]

On the fourth day, she found the rhythm. [450]
Not just the one she tapped with her fingers, but the one buried in the station’s records—a pattern of deletions, of gaps where data should have been. [482]
Someone had been erasing the past, not all at once, but in increments, like the slow retreat of the tide. [509]
Elara’s breath hitched. [513]

She followed the trail to the station’s lowest level, where the sea level monitors blinked in the dim light. [540]
There, beneath a loose floor panel, she found a stack of atlas pages, each one torn from the same book. [564]
They mapped the reefs as they had been—before the bleaching, before the ban, before the world had tried to forget. [592]

Elara’s hands trembled as she pieced them together. [602]
The paths hadn’t disappeared; they’d been hidden. [614]
And the one who had hidden them was still here, in the station’s periodic eternity, watching the sea rise and fall like a heartbeat. [648]

She tapped out the rhythm of the waves against the metal wall, the sound echoing through the empty corridors. [673]
Somewhere in the station, a response came—a faint, answering knock. [692]
Elara smiled. [695]

She had come to witness the bleaching, but she had found something else: the truth, drifting just beneath the surface, waiting to be assembled. [731]
The sea would keep rising, the corals would keep fading, but the paths were still there—if only someone remembered how to follow them. [764]
And she would. [767]
