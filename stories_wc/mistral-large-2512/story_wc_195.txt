The alchemical orchard greenhouse stretched endlessly under a sky that had forgotten dawn, its glass panes fogged with the breath of unseen things. [18]
Sir Aldric stood motionless among the gnarled trees, their fruits pulsing with an inner light that cast long, trembling shadows. [39]
He had not spoken in years, not since the war ended and the world began to unravel at the seams. [61]
His sword, once a companion, now hung at his side like a relic of a life he no longer understood. [82]

A rustle of paper against stone made him turn. [90]
Beneath a bench overgrown with silver-leafed vines lay an abandoned marionette theater program, its edges curled with damp. [113]
The ink had bled in places, but the title was still legible: *"The Puppeteer’s Oath."* [128]
Aldric knelt, his gauntlets scraping against the flagstones, and lifted it. [141]
The program’s pages whispered secrets in a language just beyond hearing, a murmured allegiance to forces that moved the strings of fate itself. [167]

He had come to the orchard seeking something he could not name, only feel—a shape shifting in the dark, a possibility waiting to be grasped. [193]
The alchemists who tended this place spoke of it in hushed tones: the greenhouse was a crucible where reality thinned, where the boundaries between what was and what could be blurred like ink in water. [231]
Aldric had followed the pull of it, though he did not know why. [245]

The program in his hands grew warm. [251]
A figure stepped from the trees—a woman with eyes like polished obsidian, her fingers tracing forgotten patterns in the air. [276]
"You feel it, don’t you?" she said. [282]
Her voice was the sound of leaves skittering over graves, of promises half-remembered. [299]
"The threads are loosening. The world is unsnapping." [311]

Aldric’s breath hitched. [315]
He had seen it in the war: battles fought and refought in the same instant, soldiers flickering like candle flames in a draft. [339]
The alchemists called it the "shivering bliss," the moment when all things hung in perfect, terrible balance. [360]
The woman smiled, her teeth too white, too sharp. [369]
"You want to capture the shape of possibility," she murmured. [380]
"It’s why you’re here. It’s why *I’m* here." [390]

She held out her hand. [394]
The program in Aldric’s grip pulsed once, twice, then dissolved into embers that swirled around her fingers. [416]
The orchard groaned, its branches twisting into new, impossible geometries. [430]
The fruits glowed brighter, their light now factually mystical, humming with the resonance of a thousand untold futures. [454]

Aldric’s sword trembled in its scabbard. [461]
He had spent years withdrawing from the world, from its noise, its pain, its ceaseless demand for action. [484]
But here, in this place where reality shifted like sand beneath his feet, he felt something else—a pull, a need. [510]
The woman’s fingers brushed his wrist, and the world stuttered. [523]

"Look," she whispered. [526]
Through the fogged glass, Aldric saw them: shadowy figures moving in perfect, jerky unison, their limbs controlled by strings of light. [553]
The marionettes. [555]
They danced in the space between moments, their faces blank, their movements precise. [573]
One turned toward him, its hollow eyes reflecting not his face, but every face he might have worn. [598]

The woman’s grip tightened. [602]
"To capture the shape of possibility, you must become the hand that guides the strings." [623]
Aldric’s breath came fast, his heart a drumbeat in his chest. [638]
The orchard’s light dimmed, then flared, and in that flare, he saw it—the outline of a future where he was not a knight, not a man, but something else entirely. [676]

He unsnapped his sword belt and let it fall. [685]
The metal clattered against the stones, the sound echoing like a death knell. [699]
The woman’s smile widened. [703]
"Good," she said. [705]
"Now we begin." [708]

The marionettes surged forward, their strings tangling around Aldric’s limbs, lifting him into the air. [730]
The orchard’s light swallowed him whole, and for the first time in years, he did not resist. [753]
The world was unsnapping, and he would be the one to weave it back together. [772]
Or unravel it entirely. [777]

The last thing he saw before the darkness took him was the program’s final line, now glowing on the stones: *"The oath is not to the puppet, but to the dance."* [810]
