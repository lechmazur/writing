The facility hummed like a dying whale, its walls slick with condensation that never dried. [14]
Dr. Elias Voss adjusted the straps of his rebreather, fingers trembling not from the cold but from the weight of the corridors pressing in. [38]
He hadn’t set foot in the Blackthorn Deep Research Station in seven years, not since the collapse, not since the screaming. [64]

The codex lay open on the rusted lab table, its margins alive with flecks of gold that pulsed faintly, as if breathing. [89]
Elias had stolen it from a sunken archive off the Azores, its illuminations shifting when he wasn’t looking, mapping things that weren’t there—yet. [124]
He traced a finger along the edge, and the gold flared, revealing a path through the facility’s schematics, one that didn’t exist on any blueprint. [155]

Undersea cables snaked through the station’s guts, thick as pythons, their insulation peeling to expose copper veins. [179]
They carried more than data now; they carried echoes. [191]
Elias had heard them in his nightmares, the voices of the lost researchers, their last words tangled in the current. [216]
He was here to return what was taken, though no one would remember to thank him. [235]

The tide was turning. [240]
He had three hours before the lower levels flooded, before the pressure crushed the last air pockets like eggshells. [263]
Elias moved quickly, his claustrophobia a live wire in his chest, sparking every time a pipe groaned or a bulkhead creaked. [291]
The gold flecks in the codex dimmed as he descended, the path fading like a dream upon waking. [314]

He found them in the observation chamber, their bodies preserved in the brine, faces frozen in silent terror. [340]
The lead researcher, Dr. Liora Chen, clutched a data slate, its screen cracked but still glowing. [363]
Elias pried it from her fingers, the words scrolling in a loop: *"Phase transition imminent. They’re not dead. They’re—"* [388]
The rest was static. [393]

A vibration shuddered through the floor, not from the tide but from something deeper, something moving through the cables. [422]
Elias’s breath hitched as the gold flecks in the codex flared again, this time mapping a route not through the facility, but through the walls themselves. [455]
He pressed his palm to the metal, and where his skin touched, the surface rippled like water. [477]

The phase transition wasn’t a metaphor. [484]
The station was built on a fault line in reality, a place where the membrane between states was thin. [510]
The researchers hadn’t drowned; they’d slipped sideways, into a version of the world where the tide never came, where the cables carried something else entirely. [548]

Elias stepped through. [553]
The air on the other side was thick, syrupy, and the walls pulsed with a slow, alien rhythm. [579]
The lost researchers stood in a circle, their mouths moving in unison, chanting a frequency that made his teeth ache. [608]
Liora turned, her eyes black with gold flecks, and smiled. [624]

"You came back," she said. [630]
Elias didn’t answer. [633]
He placed the codex at her feet, its pages now blank, the gold absorbed into the floor like blood into sand. [661]
The cables above them thrummed, and the tide roared in the distance, but here, in this forgotten pocket of existence, there was only the hush of the unremembered, waiting. [700]

He knelt beside them, not to join, but to stand by. [712]
The phase transition reversed. [717]
The station groaned, the walls sealing shut behind him as the water rushed in. [738]
Elias didn’t fight it. [743]
The last thing he saw was the gold flecks in Liora’s eyes, winking out one by one, like stars swallowed by dawn. [774]

The tide changed. [779]
The cables went dark. [784]
And somewhere, in the crushing hush of the deep, the facility breathed its last. [800]
