The staircase spiraled upward, each step identical to the last, worn smooth by time or perhaps by the countless feet that had trod them before. [19]
Elias stood at the base, his breath steady despite the weight of the air, thick with the scent of old stone and something indefinable—like regret, if regret had a smell. [47]
He was a grim optimist, the kind of man who carried hope like a bruise, tender and persistent. [68]
In his palm rested a pair of dice, one chipped at the corner where a six should have been, the flaw catching the dim light like a secret. [99]

This was no ordinary staircase. [105]
It was infinite, or so the legends said, a construct of perpetual motion where each step led not to an end but to another beginning. [135]
Elias had come seeking proof, not of its infinity, but of its limits. [152]
If he could rupture the cycle—just once—he might capture the texture of a missed opportunity, the ghost of what could have been. [183]

He had spent years studying mathematical proofs, tracing the patterns of motion in the world around him. [207]
The staircase was no different, he reasoned. [214]
Its balance was perfect, yet fragile, like a tightrope walker who never faltered but could be unseated by a single gust. [243]
Elias intended to be that gust. [250]

He took the first step, then another, his boots scuffing against the stone. [267]
The dice in his hand felt warm, or maybe that was just the heat of his resolve. [285]
He had always been balancedly daring, walking the line between recklessness and caution, never tipping too far in either direction. [319]
It was why he had survived this long, why he had made it this far. [338]

At the hundredth step, he paused. [345]
The air here was thinner, or perhaps it was just his imagination. [360]
He rolled the dice between his fingers, feeling the rough edge of the chipped one. [377]
What were the odds, he wondered, of breaking something that had no end? [393]

He had a theory. [398]
If the staircase was truly infinite, then its motion was a closed loop, a self-sustaining cycle. [424]
But if he could introduce a variable—something unpredictable—he might disrupt it. [445]
The dice were his variable. [452]

He crouched, placing them on the step before him. [463]
One roll, that was all it would take. [472]
He exhaled, then flicked his wrist. [480]
The dice clattered against the stone, spinning wildly before settling. [496]
A three and a—nothing. [502]
The chipped die had landed on its flawed side, the number obscured. [520]

For a moment, nothing happened. [527]
Then the staircase shuddered. [534]
A deep groan echoed through the stone, like the earth itself was protesting. [555]
Elias braced himself as the steps beneath him trembled, cracks spiderwebbing across the surface. [580]
He had done it. [584]
He had ruptured the cycle. [590]

But the staircase did not stop. [597]
It simply... changed. [602]
The steps beneath him shifted, rearranging themselves into a new pattern, one that still spiraled upward but now with a slight tilt, as if the entire structure had been nudged off-kilter. [649]
Elias stared, his breath catching. [661]
It wasn’t the end he had expected, but it was something. [677]

He picked up the dice, the chipped one now warm to the touch. [693]
The texture of the missed opportunity was here, in the way the staircase had adapted, in the way it had refused to break entirely. [727]
He had wanted proof of limits, but what he had found was something else—a reminder that even in infinity, there was room for change. [765]

Elias took another step, then another, the staircase stretching before him, altered but unbroken. [789]
He would keep climbing. [795]
After all, he was a grim optimist. [802]
