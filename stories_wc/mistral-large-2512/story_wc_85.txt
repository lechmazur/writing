The cobalt terrace glowed faintly under the bruised sky of dusk, its stone railing worn smooth by decades of silent hands. [17]
Elias Vey leaned against it, the weight of unspoken words pressing against his ribs like a second heartbeat. [35]
He had spent his life tracing bloodlines for those who wished to erase them, selling false pedigrees to war criminals and stolen children alike. [62]
The guilt was a sieve through which every breath passed, leaving only a sieved hush in its wake. [82]

His fingers traced the edge of a pocket watch, its brass case warm from his body. [99]
The second hand had snapped off years ago, lost in the chaos of a deal gone sour. [117]
Now, it pointed eternally to the hour he had first lied for money—3:17, the time his mother had died alone. [138]
He told himself the watch was broken, but the truth was worse: it still ticked, just not for him. [158]

Elias had come to the terrace to quell the noise in his head. [172]
Not the usual whispers of his clients’ crimes, but something newer, sharper—a name he couldn’t shake. [190]
*Liora Vey.* [193]
His sister, dead at twelve, or so he’d been told. [204]
But the records were too clean, the story too rehearsed. [216]
He had spent years manufacturing false memories for others; now, he suspected someone had done the same to him. [238]

The shore below the terrace was littered with driftwood, each piece carved into shapes by the tide and time. [257]
Locals called them "ghost fingers," claiming they held the last thoughts of drowned sailors. [273]
Elias didn’t believe in ghosts, but he believed in patterns. [284]
By sifting through the carvings, he hoped to find one that matched the symbol he’d seen in his sister’s old sketchbook—a spiral inside a triangle. [317]

His hands trembled as he turned over a piece of wood, its surface smooth as bone. [334]
The carving was there, faint but unmistakable. [343]
His breath hitched. [346]
Liora had drawn that symbol the day she vanished. [358]
The police report said she’d run away; his father had burned her things before Elias could ask questions. [378]

A shadow fell across the wood. [385]
"Looking for something, genealogist?" [391]
The voice was familiar, but Elias couldn’t place it until he turned. [405]
The man was older, his face lined with the same regret Elias carried. [419]
"You’re my uncle," Elias said, the words sour on his tongue. [430]
The man—*his uncle*—nodded. [435]
"Your father paid me to say she died. [444]
I carved that symbol into the driftwood myself, years later, when I couldn’t live with the lie anymore." [470]

Elias’s vision blurred. [474]
The watch in his pocket felt heavier. [482]
He had spent his life helping others bury their pasts, but his own had been buried for him. [506]
The truth wasn’t just withheld; it had been sieved, the edges smoothed until it fit neatly into the story his father wanted. [537]

His uncle reached into his coat and pulled out a rusted key. [551]
"Your sister didn’t run. [558]
She was taken. [562]
Your father knew where. [567]
This opens the gate to the old boathouse." [579]

Elias took the key, his fingers numb. [587]
The weight of the unspoken words between them was suffocating, but for the first time, he felt something lighter: the possibility of answers. [618]
The terrace’s cobalt light had dimmed to indigo, the dusk deepening into night. [635]
He would go to the boathouse, but first, he had one last lie to undo. [653]

He pulled the watch from his pocket and pried off the broken hand. [668]
With a deep breath, he snapped the hour hand in half. [679]
The time of his mother’s death no longer mattered. [691]
What mattered was the truth he would dig up, no matter how much it hurt. [711]

His uncle watched him, silent. [718]
Elias pocketed the watch and the key, then turned toward the shore. [733]
The driftwood carvings would wait. [740]
The past couldn’t. [744]

He walked down the steps, the cobblestones cold beneath his boots. [758]
The sieved hush in his chest had stilled, replaced by something raw and alive. [776]
For the first time in years, he wasn’t running from the truth. [792]
He was chasing it. [796]
[797]
