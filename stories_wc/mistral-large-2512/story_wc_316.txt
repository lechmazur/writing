The floating rock dojo drifted above the churning clouds, its jagged edges catching the last light of a dying sun. [17]
Kael stepped onto the weathered training platform, his bare feet pressing into grooves worn by centuries of discipline. [35]
The air smelled of ozone and old incense, thick with the weight of unspoken truths. [52]
Across from him stood Master Veyra, her silver hair braided tight, her eyes sharp as flint. [72]
"You’ve come to train," she said, not a question. [80]
Kael exhaled, his breath steady despite the storm inside him. [91]
"I need to feel something again." [97]

Veyra’s gaze flicked to the jar resting on the altar behind her—a brain suspended in amber fluid, labeled *DUPLICATE* in faded script. [121]
"That is not your path," she said, but her fingers twitched toward it. [135]
Kael had heard the stories: the dojo’s founder, a warrior who’d shattered his own ego to master the blade, only to clone himself in desperation. [162]
The original had vanished; the duplicate remained, a silent witness to the battle for his own identity. [183]
Kael’s hands curled into fists. [188]
"I don’t want to be numb anymore." [196]

Veyra sighed, then tossed him a wooden practice sword. [207]
"Then fight." [209]
Kael caught it, the weight familiar, grounding. [217]
She struck first, her blade a blur, forcing him to parry or be split open. [232]
He moved on instinct, but his mind raced—*Why am I here? What’s left of me if I can’t even feel?* [253]
The questions sliced through his focus, and Veyra’s next strike sent the sword clattering from his grip. [273]

"Again," she ordered. [275]
Kael retrieved the blade, his palms slick with sweat. [284]
This time, he watched her feet, the way her weight shifted, the tension in her shoulders. [299]
She was a mirror, reflecting his own hesitation. [307]
He lunged, not with strength, but with precision, and their blades met in a crack that echoed through the sky. [332]
For a moment, something flickered in his chest—anger? Fear?—before it dissolved back into the void. [353]

Veyra stepped back, lowering her weapon. [360]
"You’re holding back." [363]
Kael’s jaw tightened. [366]
"I don’t know how to stop." [371]

She gestured to the jar. [375]
"That brain once thought it was the original. [384]
It fought for custody of its own life, even as the real warrior walked away. [399]
The clone believed its pain was unique, its struggle sacred. [412]
But pain is just pain. [418]
The ego clings to it because it’s the only thing that feels real." [435]

Kael stared at the jar, the duplicate’s silent scream trapped in glass. [448]
"What if I don’t want to be the original or the copy?" [461]
Veyra’s lips curved, not quite a smile. [469]
"Then vivify what’s left." [474]

She raised her sword, and the setting sun glinted off the edge. [488]
"Opposites define each other. [493]
Light needs dark. [496]
Joy needs sorrow. [500]
You cannot feel alive if you’ve never been numb." [513]
Kael’s breath hitched. [517]
The numbness wasn’t his enemy—it was the canvas. [527]

He attacked. [529]
Not with technique, but with raw, clumsy need. [540]
Veyra met him blow for blow, her movements fluid, unshaken. [553]
With each strike, the numbness cracked, not vanishing, but *shifting*—into heat, into pressure, into the pulse of his own blood. [581]
He was alive. [584]
Not whole, not healed, but *alive*. [592]

The dojo trembled, the floating rock groaning as if the earth itself had noticed. [612]
Veyra’s eyes narrowed. [616]
"History is rewriting itself," she murmured. [624]
"Below us, wars are won and lost, borders redrawn, names forgotten. [640]
But here? [643]
Here, you decide what stays." [651]

Kael’s sword arm burned. [656]
He saw it then—the pretense he’d wrapped around himself like armor: *I’m broken. I’m empty. I’m not enough.* [680]
Veyra’s blade sliced through the illusion, clean and merciless. [695]
He gasped, not from pain, but from the absence of it. [708]

She lowered her sword. [712]
"Now you understand." [716]
Kael looked at the jar, the duplicate brain floating in its prison. [730]
It had fought for a self that no longer existed. [741]
He didn’t have to. [745]

The numbness wasn’t gone. [750]
But it wasn’t everything, either. [756]
It was just one color in the spectrum. [764]
He exhaled, long and slow, and for the first time in years, the air tasted like possibility. [786]
Veyra nodded. [789]
"Go. [791]
Before history forgets you entirely." [800]

Kael bowed, then turned toward the edge of the dojo, where the clouds waited to swallow him whole. [821]
He stepped forward, not knowing if he’d fly or fall. [833]
It didn’t matter. [836]
Either way, he’d be moving. [840]
