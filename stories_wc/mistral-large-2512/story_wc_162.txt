The drifting prism terrace shimmered under a sky split by fractured light, each pane of glass refracting the sunset into jagged rainbows that stretched like broken promises across the wooden planks beneath Elias’s boots. [28]
He had come here because the corn maze architect’s lost child—his daughter, Mira—had left behind a single clue: a pilot logbook weather code scribbled in the margin of her sketchbook, the numbers "47-19-3" circled so fiercely the paper had torn. [72]
Elias traced the grain in the terrace’s hand-carved benches, his fingers following the whorls as if they might intuit the path she had taken, the necessary distances she had put between them before vanishing. [113]
The wood was warm, almost alive, its patterns whispering of storms and stillness, of choices made in the quiet before dawn. [141]

Mira had always been featherly determined, a quality Elias had admired until it became the thing that pushed her away. [163]
She had spent her childhood mapping thresholds—doorways, bridges, the edges of cornfields—asking why some felt sacred, why others made her skin prickle with the wrongness of crossing. [197]
The terrace, with its shifting prisms and unstable footing, was the last place she had been seen, her footprints ending abruptly at the edge of a glass panel that now reflected only the sky. [236]
Elias had analyzed the grain in every piece of furniture she’d ever touched, searching for answers in the way the wood had grown, the way it had been cut. [264]
But the terrace’s benches were different; their grain ran in spirals, as if the trees had twisted in their sleep, dreaming of escape. [292]

The pilot logbook weather code haunted him. [298]
He had found it tucked into the spine of her favorite book, a guide to atmospheric phenomena, the numbers corresponding to a storm system that had never materialized—at least, not in any record he could find. [344]
But after the butterfly effect, after the world had splintered into versions of itself, Elias had learned to question what was real. [372]
Perhaps the storm had existed in a parallel sky, one where Mira had stepped through a threshold and not looked back. [401]

The terrace creaked beneath him, the glass panels tilting as the wind shifted, their reflections distorting like memories half-remembered. [430]
Elias closed his eyes and let the fractured hush settle over him, the sound of light breaking into silence. [452]
He had spent years trying to intuit her thoughts, her fears, the way she had once intuited the sacredness of a doorway or the danger of a crossroads. [487]
But intuition was a fragile thing, easily shattered by necessary distances—by the space between a father’s love and a daughter’s need to disappear. [523]

A gust of wind sent a prism spinning, its rainbow edges slicing through the air before it clattered to the ground. [550]
Elias picked it up, the glass cool against his palm, and for a moment, he saw her: Mira, standing at the edge of the terrace, her hair tangled with light, her smile knowing. [590]
Then she was gone, and the prism was just a prism, its facets reflecting nothing but the truth he had been avoiding. [621]
She had left because she had to, because some thresholds were not meant to be crossed twice. [645]

The pilot logbook weather code burned in his pocket, a reminder that even storms could be mapped, even if their paths were invisible. [672]
Elias set the prism back on the bench, its grain now running straight, as if the wood had finally settled into stillness. [699]
He understood, then, why some thresholds felt sacred: because they were the places where the world bent, where the necessary distances between people became visible, if only for a moment. [748]
The terrace swayed beneath him, the fractured hush swallowing his footsteps as he turned away, the weight of the logbook in his pocket the only proof that any of it had been real. [791]
