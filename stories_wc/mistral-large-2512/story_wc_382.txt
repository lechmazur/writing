The rooftop garden was alive with the whisper of falling stars, their trails etching fleeting silver across the night sky. [16]
Elara adjusted the shawl around her shoulders, her fingers tracing the embroidered constellations her dead language tutor, Master Veyra, had once pointed out to her. [45]
She had come here every week since his passing, not just to tend the herbs he’d planted, but to speak to him in the only way she knew how—through the old tongue he’d taught her, the language of stone and mortar. [90]

The antique desk seal sat heavy in her pocket, its brass edges worn smooth by time. [106]
She had found it in his study, tucked beneath a stack of yellowed manuscripts, its surface etched with the same symbols that adorned the city’s oldest buildings. [138]
Veyra had never mentioned it, but Elara knew it was important—why else would he have kept it hidden? [161]

A rustle of fabric made her turn. [168]
Mira, her neighbor from the floor below, stepped onto the rooftop, holding a small ceramic bowl. [187]
"I borrowed that sugar last week," Mira said, her voice warm with the familiarity of their ritual. [205]
Elara smiled, taking the bowl. "And now you’ve returned it with interest—tea every Wednesday since." [224]
Mira chuckled, settling onto the bench beside her. "You’re the only one who doesn’t mind my terrible attempts at conversation." [242]

Elara’s fingers tightened around the seal. [248]
Mira had been coming for months, always under the guise of borrowing something trivial—a cup of flour, a handful of salt—but their weekly tea sessions had become something more. [278]
Elara had never told her about Veyra’s lessons, about the way the old man had believed buildings held memories, that their walls could speak if you knew how to listen. [316]
But Mira had a way of asking questions that felt like an interrogation, gentle but persistent. [334]

"Why do you come up here?" Mira asked, her gaze drifting to the meteor shower. [349]
Elara hesitated. "To remember." [354]
Mira nodded, as if that explained everything. "And the seal?" [364]
Elara’s breath caught. [368]
She hadn’t realized she’d taken it out, hadn’t meant to let Mira see it. [384]
But Mira wasn’t looking at her with curiosity—she was looking at her with recognition. [402]

"You know what this is," Elara said, not a question. [412]
Mira exhaled slowly. "I do." [418]
She reached into her own pocket and pulled out an identical seal, its surface just as worn. [438]
Elara’s pulse quickened. "You were his student too." [452]

Mira’s smile was sad. "Not just a student. His daughter." [465]
The words settled between them like the dust of the stars. [478]
Elara had known Veyra for years, had sat in his cluttered study while he spoke of forgotten dialects and the secrets of ancient architects. [508]
But he had never mentioned a daughter. [517]

"Why?" Elara asked, her voice barely above a whisper. [527]
Mira’s fingers traced the seal’s engravings. "Because some truths are too heavy to carry alone." [548]
She turned to Elara, her eyes reflecting the meteor trails. "We all agreed to the lie—the one where he was just a tutor, where his work was just a hobby." [578]
Elara’s chest tightened. "But it wasn’t." [585]

"No," Mira said. "It was a legacy. A language meant to be passed down, not to strangers, but to those who would understand its weight." [618]
She leaned forward, her voice patiently nimble, as if she’d been waiting years to say this. "The buildings *do* speak, Elara. And they’re telling us it’s time to listen." [654]

Elara looked at the seal in her palm, then at the city sprawling beneath them, its towers and spires humming with stories she’d only begun to hear. [689]
Mira was right—they had all been part of an agreed-upon lie, a quiet pact to keep the truth hidden until the right moment. [722]
And now, under the watchful gaze of the falling stars, that moment had arrived. [743]

Elara met Mira’s gaze. "Then let’s listen." [752]
Mira nodded, and the two of them sat in silence as the meteor shower painted the sky, the weight of the past finally lifting into something new. [784]
