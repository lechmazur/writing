The terra-cotta grotto glowed amber under the starlight, its curved walls whispering secrets of a thousand forgotten travelers. [16]
Lirien, the drifting roadside poet, traced her fingers along the grooves of ancient carvings, her breath shallow with wonder. [35]
She had followed the rumors here—of a place where time bent like reeds in the wind, where the energy beings, those luminous wanderers from beyond the sky, had left their mark. [68]
Her motivation was simple: to discover the texture of time, to feel its rough edges and smooth hollows as one might a lover’s skin. [96]
But the grotto demanded more than curiosity; it demanded choice. [108]

At her feet lay a frayed coil of rope, its fibers stiff with old sweat and desperation. [126]
Lirien knew its history without being told—this was no ordinary hemp, but the ghost of a prison escape, a relic of some soul who had clawed their way to freedom only to leave this behind. [159]
She knelt, lifting it with reverence, the weight of its past pressing into her palms. [177]
The energy beings had altered the world, their arrival rewriting the rules of cause and effect, and now the rope felt like a question: *What would you risk to unravel the impossible?* [213]

Lirien was ethically playful, a trait that had saved her from despair more times than she could count. [234]
She grinned, looping the rope around her wrist, testing its give. [249]
If time was a fabric, then this frayed thing was a thread pulled loose—one tug, and the whole tapestry might unravel. [273]
But which thread? And at what cost? [282]

The grotto’s walls pulsed faintly, as if breathing. [293]
Lirien pressed her ear to the terra-cotta, listening. [303]
A pattern emerged—not in sound, but in sensation, a rhythm like a heartbeat slowing, then quickening, then slowing again. [329]
She followed it, her steps light, her pulse matching the grotto’s cadence. [346]
The energy beings had left their fingerprints here, twisting time into loops and spirals, and now she was part of it. [369]

Uncovering layers was her method, her way of making sense of the world. [383]
She peeled back the grotto’s secrets like an onion, each revelation stinging her eyes with truth. [404]
The rope, she realized, was not just a remnant of escape—it was a key. [422]
The prisoner who had left it had known something, had *felt* something in this very place. [442]
Had they, too, sought the texture of time? [452]

Lirien’s fingers trembled as she tied the rope to a stalagmite, its rough surface biting into the hemp. [474]
The grotto seemed to hold its breath. [482]
She stepped back, watching as the rope tightened, then slackened, then tightened again, as if testing its own limits. [510]
An impossible choice loomed before her: pull the rope and risk unraveling time itself, or leave it be and walk away from the only answer she’d ever sought. [547]

Her heart pounded, but her mind was clear. [558]
The energy beings had not come to destroy, but to *change*—to force humanity to confront the illusions it clung to. [585]
And what was time, if not the greatest illusion of all? [599]

Lirien reached for the rope. [604]
The moment her fingers brushed the fibers, the grotto erupted in light, the terra-cotta walls shimmering like liquid gold. [630]
She gasped, but did not let go. [638]
The rope burned cold in her grip, and suddenly she was falling—not through space, but through time, through layers of moments stacked like pages in a book. [678]

She saw the prisoner, a woman with hollow eyes, tying the rope to this same stalagmite centuries ago. [702]
She saw the woman hesitate, then laugh, then vanish into the grotto’s depths. [722]
She saw herself, standing here in the present, making the same choice. [738]

The texture of time was not smooth or rough, but *alive*, a living thing that pulsed and breathed and *remembered*. [763]
Lirien understood then: the impossible choice was not between action and inaction, but between fear and surrender. [788]

She pulled the rope. [793]
The grotto trembled, the stars above blinking out one by one, then returning brighter than before. [817]
And when the light faded, Lirien was still there, the rope now limp in her hands, its frayed ends whispering secrets only she could hear. [850]
