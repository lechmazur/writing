The observation deck stretched like a frozen breath against the void, its curved glass walls warped by the time dilation that had made this place both sanctuary and prison. [23]
Elias stood at the edge, his fingers brushing the cold metal railing, the only sound the faint hum of dormant machinery—a reminder that the station had been abandoned for decades, yet still pulsed with the ghost of its purpose. [66]
He was a blessed pariah, shunned not for malice but for the gift that made others uneasy: his ability to see the threads of time, not as a river, but as a tapestry, each moment a stitch that could be tugged, frayed, or mended. [119]
Here, where time bled slower than the rest of the universe, his curse was less a burden and more a quiet companion. [145]

His grandfather’s gilded compass rose applique lay heavy in his pocket, its edges worn smooth by generations of anxious fingers. [172]
It had been passed down through the family, each heir adding their own touch—a scratch, a dent, a prayer etched into the gold. [199]
Elias traced the embossed needle with his thumb, feeling the weight of its promise: *True north is not a direction, but a choice.* [229]
His family had believed that, even as the world outside the station crumbled into chaos. [245]

The deck’s silence was not the absence of sound, but the presence of something deeper, like the hush before a storm or the pause between heartbeats. [276]
It echoed in the way the stars outside hung motionless, their light temporally stretched into lazy ribbons, as if the universe itself had exhaled and forgotten to inhale. [314]
Elias had come here after the shutdown, when the station’s reactors failed and the last of the crew fled, leaving him behind—not out of cruelty, but because no one else could bear the way time moved differently for him. [362]
To them, he was a relic, a man out of sync. [375]

His motivation had always been simple: to turn confusion into exploration. [392]
If time was a maze, then he would map it. [403]
If the station was a tomb, then he would make it a library. [418]
And so, he had spent years sketching the night sky on anniversaries, a family custom that had begun with his great-grandmother, who believed the stars were not fixed, but alive—breathing, shifting, whispering. [462]
Each year, he added to the collection, his drawings pinned to the walls like constellations of memory. [485]

Tonight was different. [492]
Tonight, he had glimpsed something in the stars—a flicker, a distortion, as if one of the ribbons of light had trembled. [523]
It was gone before he could be sure, but the gilded compass in his pocket burned with sudden heat. [549]
Elias pulled it out, watching as the needle spun wildly before settling on a point just beyond the observation deck’s glass. [579]

There, in the void, was a shape. [591]
Not a ship, not a star, but something between—a tear in the fabric of the stretched time, pulsing like a heartbeat. [624]
His breath fogged the glass as he pressed closer, his reflection superimposed over the anomaly. [649]
The family sketches fluttered behind him, their edges curling with static, as if the station itself was reacting to the disturbance. [682]

Elias understood then. [690]
True north was not a destination, but a moment—the instant when confusion became clarity, when fear became curiosity. [723]
He reached for his sketchbook, the pages blank except for the date: the anniversary of his grandfather’s death. [751]
The pencil trembled in his grip as he began to draw, not the stars as they were, but as they might be—alive, shifting, calling. [788]

The silence around him deepened, no longer empty, but full of possibility. [807]
The station was not a prison. [813]
It was a threshold. [816]
And he was the only one who could cross it. [827]
[830]
