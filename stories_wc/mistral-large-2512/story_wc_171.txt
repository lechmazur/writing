The terrace of the Temple of the Twin Moons had seen a thousand negotiations, each one chiseled into its worn stone like the names of the dead. [19]
Liora Veyne stood at its edge, the midsummer air thick with the scent of jasmine and the distant hum of cicadas, her fingers tracing the grain of her ebony clipboard. [47]
It was heavier than it looked, that clipboard—carved from the heartwood of a tree struck by lightning, or so the monks claimed. [72]
She had carried it through every war zone, every tented peace summit, its surface a map of ink stains and half-erased promises. [96]

Tonight, the celestial bodies aligned in their slow dance, Jupiter and Venus drawing near like reluctant lovers. [115]
The monks said such nights were for anchoring ideals in practice, for turning theory into flesh. [131]
Liora had spent her life chasing that alchemy, but tonight felt different. [145]
The clipboard trembled in her grip. [151]

Across the terrace, General Kessar emerged from the shadows, his armor dull in the moonlight. [168]
He had been her fiercest adversary, a man who believed peace was a weakness to be exploited. [187]
Yet here he stood, unarmed, his hands clasped behind his back like a penitent. [204]
"You’re early," Liora said, her voice operatively gentle—soft enough to disarm, firm enough to command. [222]
Kessar’s mouth twisted. "I came to see if you’d actually show." [236]

She had mustered every ounce of her resolve to meet him here. [249]
The ritual significance of the terrace wasn’t lost on her: the monks had built it where the first truce was signed, where the blood of enemies had mingled with the wine of reconciliation. [281]
But rituals were only as strong as the people who performed them. [296]
And Liora was tired. [301]

Kessar stepped forward, his boots scuffing the ancient stone. [314]
"You’ve spent your life negotiating," he said. "What’s left for you when the wars end?" [333]
The question struck deeper than any blade. [340]
Liora had asked herself the same thing a hundred times. [352]
The price of redemption, she knew, was never just the signing of a treaty. [367]
It was the quiet moments after, when the world moved on and left you standing in the ruins of your own convictions. [394]

She opened the clipboard, revealing the treaty—its edges singed from the last bomb that had nearly claimed her life. [422]
Kessar’s eyes flicked to the document, then back to her. [434]
"You really think this will hold?" he asked. [443]
Liora exhaled. "No. But we have to try." [454]

The wind shifted, carrying the scent of rain. [463]
Somewhere in the distance, a bell tolled, marking the hour. [476]
Kessar reached into his coat and pulled out a single silver coin, pressing it into her palm. [496]
"It’s from the first minted after the last war," he said. "A reminder that some things are worth more than gold." [526]

Liora closed her fingers around it. [534]
The metal was warm, almost alive. [542]
She thought of all the wars she’d brokered, all the lives saved and lost, and wondered if redemption was even possible. [570]
Or if it was just another kind of surrender. [582]

Kessar nodded, as if reading her thoughts. [591]
"Maybe the price isn’t what we give up," he said. "Maybe it’s what we choose to carry." [613]
Liora looked down at the clipboard, at the treaty, at the coin in her hand. [630]
The celestial bodies had nearly aligned. [638]

She took a breath. [643]
"Then let’s carry it together," she said. [653]

The monks began their chant, their voices rising like smoke into the night. [670]
Liora and Kessar turned toward the altar, the weight of the moment settling between them. [692]
The price of redemption was high, but so was the cost of walking away. [711]

And for the first time in years, Liora believed it might be worth it. [730]
