The loft smelled of damp wool and old tea, its rain-beaded skylight casting fractured light onto the ash wood carving blank propped against the wall. [23]
Elara traced the grain with her thumb, the texture rough under her skin, a reminder that time had passed but not smoothed everything away. [51]
She had been the lion tamer’s widow for three years now, though the title felt like a costume she could never quite remove. [80]
The kettle on the stove began its low, trembling whistle, steam curling into the air like a ghost testing the edges of the room. [110]

She moved to the stove, her slippers scuffing against the warped floorboards, each step a quiet acknowledgment of the space she now contained alone. [139]
The whistle grew louder, insistent, but she let it build, savoring the way the sound filled the silence without demanding anything in return. [170]
This was her ritual: to let the kettle boil while she sat with the weight of what was here and what was gone. [195]

The ash wood blank had been a gift from her husband, Jarek, on their last anniversary. [216]
“For when you’re ready,” he’d said, pressing it into her hands with that crooked smile of his, the one that made her stomach flip even after a decade of marriage. [249]
She hadn’t been ready then, and she wasn’t sure she was ready now, but the wood had waited, hauntingly practical in its patience. [275]
It didn’t ask for meaning; it simply existed, a vessel for whatever she chose to carve into it—or not. [298]

Elara poured the boiling water over the tea leaves, watching them unfurl like tiny, drowning dancers. [322]
The steam rose in lazy spirals, and for a moment, she imagined Jarek standing beside her, his broad shoulders blocking the light, his laugh warm against her ear. [356]
But the image dissolved as quickly as it came, leaving only the scent of bergamot and the faint ache of absence. [380]

She carried her tea to the window, where the rain slid down the skylight in silver rivulets. [402]
Outside, the city hummed, indifferent to the way loss could crystallize time into something sharp and unyielding. [428]
She had spent the first year after Jarek’s death trying to outrun the grief, filling her days with noise and motion. [453]
But it was only when she stopped running that she realized grief wasn’t something to escape—it was something to contain. [479]

The ash wood blank seemed to pulse with possibility, as if it had been waiting for her to understand that. [504]
She set her tea down and picked up her carving knife, the blade catching the light like a sliver of moon. [528]
The first cut was hesitant, the wood resisting before yielding to the blade’s edge. [547]
She carved a line, then another, each stroke a question, each curve an answer she wasn’t sure she had. [572]

By the time the kettle had cooled, the blank had begun to take shape: a lion, not roaring or rampant, but crouched, its gaze steady, its presence both fierce and still. [610]
It wasn’t the lion Jarek had tamed—those had been creatures of muscle and roar, their power on full display. [638]
This one was different, a quiet embodiment of what remained when the noise faded. [662]

Elara ran her fingers over the carving, the wood warm now, as if it had absorbed her touch. [685]
She had spent so long trying to harvest lessons from loss, as if grief were a field to be tilled and sown. [711]
But maybe the lesson was simpler: that some things couldn’t be contained, only held. [733]
The lion in her hands wasn’t a cage or a memory—it was a companion, here and gone in the same breath. [761]

The rain had slowed, the skylight now a sheet of muted light, and Elara set the carving down, its edges softened by the diffused glow. [792]
She took a sip of her tea, the bitterness grounding her, and for the first time in years, the rust-hued peace of the loft felt like enough. [823]
