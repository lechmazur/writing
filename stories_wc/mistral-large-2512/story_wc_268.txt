The temple library had stood for millennia, its stone arches sagging like the shoulders of an old king who had long since forgotten his own name. [20]
Dust swirled in the dim light filtering through cracked stained glass, each mote a silent witness to the slow unraveling of time. [40]
Here, among the crumbling scrolls and warped wooden shelves, Liora moved with the quiet precision of a thief—or a scholar who had long since abandoned the distinction. [72]
She was a diminutive titan, not in stature—her frame barely reached the lower shelves—but in the weight of her purpose, which pressed upon her like the gravity of forgotten gods. [108]

The pretender had ruled for three cycles of the shifting constellations, each one a pause in the sky’s endless dance, a breath held too long. [138]
His claim to the throne was written in blood and sealed with lies, but Liora knew the truth was buried somewhere in this library, waiting to sunder his reign like a blade through parchment. [176]
She had spent the last year tracing the pretender’s steps through cryptic messages left in library books, each one a breadcrumb leading her deeper into the labyrinth of his deception. [210]
The latest had been a single line scrawled in the margin of a treatise on celestial navigation: *"The rune of drift answers only to the unbroken."* [242]

Liora traced the words with her fingertips, the ink long dried but still faintly warm, as if the writer had only just set down the pen. [270]
Iron gall ink, she noted—the kind that ate through paper over centuries, leaving behind only the ghost of its intent. [292]
She had found such a pellet once, tucked into the spine of a book on royal lineage, its purpose unclear until she crushed it between her fingers and watched the ink bloom like a bruise across the page. [330]
The message had been a name: *Veythas the Forgotten*, a king whose reign had ended in mystery, his throne usurped by a shadow. [360]

The pretender bore no resemblance to Veythas, but that was the point. [375]
He had built his legitimacy on the absence of proof, on the silence of the archives. [395]
Liora’s fingers brushed against a loose stone in the shelf, and she pried it free to reveal a hollow behind it. [420]
Inside lay a single scroll, its edges singed as if rescued from a fire. [440]
She unrolled it carefully, the parchment brittle with age, and found a map—not of lands, but of stars. [465]
A rune was etched into the center, its lines shifting when she tilted the page, as though it were not ink but something alive. [495]
The rune of drift. [500]

She had read of it in fragments: a sigil that bent time, that allowed its bearer to step between moments as easily as one might step between rooms. [535]
The pretender had used it to erase Veythas, to rewrite history so thoroughly that even the stars had forgotten. [560]
But the rune was not his to wield. [570]
It answered only to the unbroken, and Liora had spent her life breaking nothing—not her word, not her resolve, not the silence she had kept while the pretender’s lies took root. [610]

She pressed the scroll to her chest, feeling the rune’s pulse against her skin, a heartbeat that had been waiting for her. [640]
The library groaned around her, the weight of centuries settling into the cracks of its foundation. [665]
She did not need to storm the throne room or raise an army. [680]
All she needed was this: the truth, written in iron gall ink and hidden in the margins of the world. [705]
The pretender would not see her coming. [715]
He would not even know she had been here, in this regally unpretentious ruin, until the moment his crown crumbled to dust. [745]

Liora smiled, the expression sharp enough to cut. [755]
The constellations shifted above the temple’s broken roof, their pause ending at last. [775]
She rolled the scroll tight and tucked it into her sleeve. [790]
The time for unmasking had come. [798]
