The arboretum clung to the seaside cliff like a stubborn dream, its glass panes fogged with salt and time. [16]
Lena had come here after the drone strike, not for healing—she didn’t believe in that word anymore—but because the last lighthouse keeper had left behind a ledger, its margins filled with pressed ferns and coordinates of storms. [54]
She found the crumpled photograph in the potting shed, half-buried under a sack of bone meal. [73]
It showed a wedding: her sister’s, the one she’d missed because she’d been delayed by a protest in the capital. [95]
The bride’s smile was a knife twist in Lena’s chest. [105]

She unfolded the photo slowly, as if the creases held the weight of the explosion. [121]
The arboretum’s curator, an old woman named Mira, watched from the doorway, her hands stained with chlorophyll. [139]
“You’re the one who survived,” Mira said, not a question. [148]
Lena didn’t answer. [151]
She traced the bride’s veil in the photograph, the way it had caught the light before the sky turned to fire. [173]

Mira stepped inside, her movements deliberate, quietly talented in the way of those who’ve spent decades coaxing life from stubborn soil. [197]
“There’s a pearl of stillness here,” she said, tapping the glass of a terrarium where a single orchid bloomed in defiance of the cliff’s winds. [228]
Lena didn’t believe in pearls, stillness, or the kind of hope that required suspension of disbelief. [246]
But she stayed. [248]

Days blurred into weeks. [252]
Lena learned to propagate cuttings, her fingers memorizing the pressure needed to split a stem without breaking it. [273]
Mira taught her through somatic markers—tiny, physical cues that anchored knowledge in the body rather than the mind. [291]
A twitch of the wrist when the soil was too dry. [300]
A hitch in the breath when a root had taken hold. [309]

One evening, as the sun bled into the sea, Lena froze. [319]
A sound, distant but unmistakable: the hum of engines, the same pitch as the drones that had turned her sister’s wedding into a funeral pyre. [348]
Her body locked, her breath shallow. [355]
Mira didn’t move. [358]
“Look at the orchid,” she said. [363]

Lena’s gaze snapped to the terrarium. [368]
The flower swayed, not from the wind, but from the vibrations of the glass. [382]
“It’s listening,” Mira murmured. [386]
Lena’s pulse slowed. [390]
The orchid’s petals were a fragile defiance, a pearl of stillness in the chaos. [408]

She exhaled. [410]
The drones passed. [413]

Mira’s motivation had always been to anchor optimism in realism, not the blind kind, but the kind that grew in cracks, stubborn and slow. [445]
Lena began to understand. [449]
She pressed the crumpled photograph into the soil of a new cutting, burying it like a seed. [466]
If anything could grow from that, it would be proof—not of healing, but of endurance. [484]

Weeks later, the cutting sprouted. [490]
Lena didn’t celebrate. [493]
She simply tended it, her hands steady, her breath even. [504]
The arboretum perched on the cliff, a fragile thing, but it held. [517]
So did she. [520]

The last lighthouse keeper’s ledger still sat on the potting bench, its pages yellowed. [538]
Lena opened it one morning and found a new entry: *The orchid blooms when the drones come. It knows.* [561]
She closed the book. [565]
Outside, the sea crashed against the rocks, relentless and indifferent. [579]
But inside the glass, the orchid stood tall. [588]

Lena touched the photograph in her pocket, no longer crumpled, but smoothed by time. [605]
She didn’t believe in miracles. [609]
But she believed in the quiet talent of roots, in the way life persisted, not in spite of the world, but because of it. [639]
The arboretum was her anchor now, not to hope, but to something harder, something real. [662]

She turned back to the soil. [668]
The cutting needed water. [673]
