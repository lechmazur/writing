The outpost clung to the shore of the frozen lake like a forgotten thought, its rusted beams groaning under the weight of silence. [18]
Mira Voss adjusted her gloves, her breath curling in the air as she stepped over a collapsed barrel, its staves splintered from years of neglect. [42]
She had come here for the maps, not the ruins, but the two seemed inseparable now—the way the old ink bled into the cracks of the world. [73]
Her fingers traced the spine of her atlas, its leather cover worn smooth by use, and she exhaled, watching the condensation bloom on the windowpane beside her. [108]
The pattern was familiar: tiny droplets forming first at the edges, then creeping inward, as if the cold itself were drawing something out. [135]

A falcon had returned the day before, its wings beating against the gray sky like a metronome counting down to something. [162]
No one had sent it, or so the outpost’s keeper claimed, but Mira knew better. [179]
Falcons didn’t just appear; they heralded. [186]
She had seen it in the way the old man’s hands trembled when he handed her the bird’s message—a scrap of paper tucked into its leg, the ink smudged but legible. [225]
*"The rivers begin where the ice forgets its name."* [237]
The words had settled into her chest like a stone. [248]

Mira was an atlas editor, dry-witted by necessity, the kind of person who corrected borders with the same precision others used to stir tea. [275]
But precision had limits. [280]
The world didn’t always fit into neat lines, and here, at the edge of the known, the lines had frayed entirely. [305]
She had come to this outpost for the same reason she always did: to find where things began. [328]
Not just rivers, though that was the official story. [338]
No, she was chasing the singular convergence—the point where all the maps she’d ever drawn collapsed into one. [363]

The phrasebook in her pocket was her only proof she wasn’t chasing ghosts. [380]
It had belonged to a polyglot who’d vanished near the lake decades ago, its pages dog-eared at entries for "source," "origin," and "threshold." [410]
She’d found it in an archive, wedged between volumes on glacial retreat and forgotten dialects, as if someone had left it there deliberately. [443]
The last entry was in a language she didn’t recognize, but the translation was scrawled in the margin: *"The ice remembers."* [470]

Outside, the wind howled, and the condensation on the glass thickened, droplets merging into rivulets that streaked downward like tears. [499]
Mira pressed her palm to the pane, the cold biting through her glove. [515]
The pattern wasn’t random. [522]
It was a map. [526]
Not of land, but of time—of how the cold condensed the past into something visible, if only for a moment. [556]

She turned back to the atlas, flipping to the page where the lake should have been. [575]
The cartographer had left it blank, save for a single note in the corner: *"Here be nothing."* [597]
But Mira knew better. [604]
Nothing was just another word for unseen. [613]

The outpost’s keeper found her there at dawn, her breath fogging the air as she traced the window’s condensation with a fingertip. [644]
"You’re still here," he said, his voice rough with disuse. [659]
Mira didn’t look up. [664]
"The rivers begin where the ice forgets its name," she repeated, as if the words themselves could carve a path through the frost. [694]
The keeper sighed, rubbing his hands together for warmth. [710]
"Or where the ice remembers," he muttered. [720]
Mira’s fingers stilled. [725]
The phrasebook’s margin note. [732]
The convergence. [735]

She turned to him, subtly confident, the way she always was when the pieces finally clicked. [760]
"Take me to the center of the lake," she said. [773]
The keeper hesitated, then nodded. [782]
Outside, the falcon circled once more, its cry sharp against the worrying tranquility of the ice. [806]
