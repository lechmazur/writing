The orchard planet of Veyth hung suspended in the violet haze of its binary suns, its surface a labyrinth of floating rock arches that cradled groves of silver-leafed trees. [23]
Lira Vey adjusted the straps of her harness, her fingers brushing the cracked leather of her flight gloves, worn smooth by years of navigating the planet’s mercurial winds. [55]
As an intrepid orchard pilot, she knew the arches better than the lines on her palms—each one a gateway to hidden groves where the fruit ripened in defiance of Veyth’s erratic seasons. [93]
But today, the planet was different. [98]
The air hummed with a low, resonant vibration, like the plucked string of a harp no one had touched. [122]
Lira exhaled, her breath curling into the stillness. [129]
The gravity inversion was coming. [135]

She had an hour—maybe less—before the world turned itself inside out. [151]
The last time it happened, she’d watched a cluster of apples drift upward like dandelion seeds, only to shatter against the underside of a rock arch when the pull reversed. [185]
This time, she had a purpose. [191]
In her pocket, the broken arrow tip dug into her thigh, its jagged edge a relic from the old wars, when the planet’s first settlers had fought over the groves. [225]
She didn’t know why she’d kept it, only that it felt like a key. [239]
The elders spoke of a gathering of echoes—a place where the whispers of the past pooled like water, waiting to be heard. [269]
If resilience had a source, it would be there. [279]

Lira swung into the cockpit of her skiff, the vessel’s hull patched with scavenged metal from a dozen crashes. [303]
The engines sputtered to life, their purr muted by the whirling silence that had settled over Veyth. [326]
She guided the skiff toward the nearest waterway, where a thin ribbon of liquid silver snaked between the arches. [354]
Navigating by water flow was the only way to reach the heart of the groves during an inversion—gravity’s fickle dance made the usual landmarks unreliable. [389]
The current carried her deeper into the labyrinth, where the arches grew denser, their undersides slick with condensation. [418]

Then she saw it: a grove unlike any other. [429]
The trees here were lush, their branches heavy with fruit that glowed faintly in the dim light. [451]
But it wasn’t the fruit that made her pulse quicken—it was the way the leaves trembled, as if stirred by a wind that didn’t exist. [482]
An accelerant. [485]
Something in the soil, or the air, or the very rock beneath, was speeding their growth. [509]
She landed the skiff with a gentle thud, her boots sinking into the damp earth. [527]

The broken arrow tip in her pocket grew warm. [536]
Lira knelt, pressing her palm to the ground. [545]
The soil vibrated, a slow, rhythmic pulse. [554]
Then she heard it—the echoes. [560]
Voices, layered and overlapping, rising from the earth like mist. [576]
*"The arches will hold."*
*"The fruit will not fall."*
*"We endure."* [591]

Her breath caught. [594]
This was the gathering of echoes, the source of resilience. [606]
Not a place, but a memory, woven into the land itself. [619]
The settlers had known. [624]
They’d buried their hopes in the soil, and the groves had grown stronger for it. [645]

The first tremor hit. [650]
The arches groaned as gravity began to invert, their undersides now the sky. [670]
Lira didn’t move. [674]
The echoes swelled, wrapping around her like a second skin. [690]
She understood now. [694]
Resilience wasn’t about resisting change—it was about bending with it, like the trees, like the arches, like the water that carved its own path. [732]

The arrow tip in her pocket cooled. [740]
She stood, her skiff already lifting with the shifting gravity. [753]
As she climbed aboard, the grove’s glow intensified, the fruit ripening in seconds, then bursting into seeds that drifted upward like stars. [783]
Lira smiled. [786]
The planet would invert, the arches would sway, but the groves would endure. [806]
And so would she. [810]
