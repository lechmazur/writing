The last human city had been silent for seventy years, its towers crumbling into the sea like forgotten teeth. [18]
Eira crouched at the mouth of the coastal cave network, her breath shallow against the damp salt air, her fingers tracing the grooves of an elm leaf fossil pressed into the stone. [52]
It was the only thing she had carried from the old world—the last tangible proof that life had once thrived in the light. [85]

She was a sensory map maker, though no one had asked her to chart these caves. [104]
The job had been hers by default, a title inherited from her grandmother, who had spent her life translating the unseen into ink and parchment. [135]
Eira’s maps didn’t just show tunnels; they recorded the weight of the air, the echo of dripping water, the way light fractured through calcite like broken glass. [165]
But the caves were changing. [170]

Something was waking beneath them. [175]
Not the slow, geological shift of stone, but something *alive*—a presence that hummed in the dark, a current of warmth where there should have been only cold. [210]
Eira had felt it first in her dreams, a voice like wind through dead branches, whispering in a language that wasn’t sound but *pressure*, a weight against her ribs. [250]
She had woken gasping, her hands clutching the elm leaf fossil, its edges biting into her palm. [272]
Transitional objects, her grandmother had called them—things that bridged the known and the unknown, the living and the dead. [298]
The fossil was hers. [302]

Now, she knelt in the cave’s heart, where the walls pulsed with an eerie, bioluminescent glow. [325]
The heat-mapping device strapped to her wrist flickered, its screen blooming with colors she didn’t recognize—swirls of violet and gold where her fear and awe tangled. [357]
She had built it herself, a clumsy thing of scavenged wires and glass, but it worked. [375]
The caves were *feeling* her back. [380]

A sound like cracking ice echoed through the chamber. [389]
Eira turned, her pulse hammering, as a fissure split the cave floor, not with the jagged violence of collapse, but with the slow, deliberate parting of lips. [428]
From the gap rose a shape—no, not a shape, a *suggestion* of one, a silhouette woven from the same glowing mist that clung to the walls. [462]
It floated, weightless, its edges shimmering like heat haze over desert sand. [483]

"You are the one who listens," it said, though its mouth did not move. [498]
The words vibrated in her bones, not her ears. [507]
Eira’s breath hitched. [511]
She had spent her life chasing the unknown, but now that it had found her, she realized she wasn’t ready. [542]
The elm leaf fossil burned against her skin. [551]

"I don’t know how to answer," she admitted, her voice raw. [564]
The thing—*entity*—tilted its head, or what passed for one. [576]
"You don’t have to speak," it murmured. "You only have to *carry*." [592]
Then it reached for her, not with hands, but with the same warmth that had seeped into the caves, the same heat that now radiated from the fossil in her grip. [630]

Eira understood. [633]
This was why she had been drawn here, why the caves had whispered to her, why the fossil had never let her go. [660]
She was to be the voice of the unknown, not by shouting into the dark, but by becoming its vessel, its translator. [690]
The entity pressed closer, its glow merging with hers, the heat-mapping device flaring white-hot before shattering. [720]
The last thing she saw was the elm leaf fossil, now pulsing with light, before the cave swallowed her whole. [747]

When Eira woke, the caves were silent again. [757]
But the fossil in her palm was warm, and the air smelled of rain before a storm. [778]
Somewhere, something was listening. [785]
And for the first time, she knew how to answer. [796]
