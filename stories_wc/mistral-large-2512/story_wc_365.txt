The repair bay smelled of ozone and rust, its high ceilings lost in the dim glow of emergency lights. [16]
Kael Veyra adjusted the straps of his sensory harness, the weight of his tools pressing into his ribs as he stepped over a collapsed workbench. [41]
He wasn’t supposed to be here—not in this abandoned spaceport, not in this crumbling sector of the galaxy where ships went to die. [70]
But the dreams had led him, as they always did, cyclically spontaneous, pulling him toward fragments of worlds that didn’t exist yet or had already been forgotten. [101]

His fingers brushed against the green glass shard in his pocket, its edges smooth from years of handling. [123]
It was the only thing he’d taken from the last world he’d mapped, a place where the sky bled violet and the air tasted like burnt sugar. [150]
He didn’t know why he kept it, only that it hummed when he touched it, a quiet vibration that synced with the thrum of his own pulse. [177]

Kael crouched beside a cracked console, its screen flickering with static. [191]
Sensory mapping wasn’t just about recording what was—it was about tracing the threads between what could be. [212]
The repair bay was a nexus, a place where the walls between worlds thinned, where the echoes of parallel universes whispered in the gaps of reality. [240]
He’d felt it the moment he’d stepped inside, the air thick with the murmur of half-remembered dreams, the kind that slipped through your fingers when you tried to hold them. [272]

His breath fogged in the cold as he activated his scanner, the device casting jagged blue lines across the bay’s skeletal remains. [296]
The readings were erratic, jumping between coordinates that shouldn’t have existed. [312]
Kael exhaled, his breath steady despite the weight of the question pressing against his ribs: *What truth was being withheld from him?* [340]
Not just from him—from every version of himself scattered across the multiverse. [356]

A sound cut through the silence, something between a sigh and a scrape. [372]
Kael turned, his boots crunching on broken glass. [381]
A figure stood in the doorway, silhouetted against the flickering light. [396]
Not a stranger—*himself*, but not. [403]
This Kael wore a tattered flight suit, his face lined with scars Kael didn’t recognize. [424]

“You’re late,” the other Kael said, his voice rough. [434]
Kael’s fingers tightened around the green shard. [443]
“Or early,” he replied. [447]
The other Kael smirked, stepping forward. [456]
“Doesn’t matter. You’re here now.” [465]
Kael’s scanner beeped, the readings spiking. [475]
The repair bay wasn’t just a nexus—it was a gate, and the other Kael had just activated it. [498]

“You’ve been trying to redirect the flow,” the other Kael said, nodding at the scanner. [520]
“You want to know what’s on the other side.” [533]
Kael swallowed. [537]
“Don’t you?” [540]
The other Kael’s expression darkened. [547]
“Some truths aren’t meant to be weighed.” [557]
Kael pulled the green shard from his pocket, its glow pulsing in time with the flickering console. [580]
“Then why are you here?” [587]

The air between them crackled, the boundaries of the repair bay blurring. [604]
The other Kael lunged, not to attack, but to grab Kael’s wrist, pressing the shard against the console. [630]
“Because you’re the only one who can do this without unraveling everything.” [655]

The screen flared white, the static resolving into an image—a world Kael had never seen, yet knew in his bones. [684]
A city of spires, its streets lined with mirrors that reflected not the present, but the past and future simultaneously. [715]
At its center stood a monument, a towering figure with its hands outstretched, holding a scale. [738]
And on one side of the scale, a single green glass shard. [752]

Kael’s breath caught. [757]
The other Kael released him, stepping back. [767]
“That’s the truth they don’t want us to know,” he said. [782]
“That we’re all just fragments of something bigger, and the weight of that knowledge would crush us.” [811]

The repair bay trembled, the walls between worlds thinning further. [828]
Kael looked down at the shard in his hand, then at the image on the screen. [845]
He had a choice: redirect the flow, or let the truth remain withheld. [861]
The scanner beeped one last time, the coordinates locking into place. [877]
Kael made his decision. [882]
[883]
