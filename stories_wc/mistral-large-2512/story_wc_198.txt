The morning fog curled around Elias’s ankles as he stepped onto the damp cobblestones, his saxophone case heavy with more than just brass. [23]
The prism atrium of the old conservatory loomed ahead, its stained-glass panels fractured into spectral shards by the mist, each one humming with a quietly vivid light that seemed to pulse in time with his breath. [61]
He had come to play, but not for an audience—for the vested hush that settled over the city at dawn, the kind of silence that felt like a held breath. [97]
The prophecy had been spoken in code years ago, woven into a melody by a musician long dead, and Elias had spent his life deciphering its notes. [129]
Now, as dewdrops formed on the reeds of his instrument, he knew the time had come to answer it. [151]

The radiant grotto in the mist was not a place on any map, but Elias had found it years ago by accident—or perhaps by design. [178]
It was a cavern of smooth stone, its walls glowing faintly with bioluminescent moss, the air thick with the scent of wet earth and something older, something like memory. [213]
He set his case down and lifted the saxophone, its polished surface catching the prismatic light like a mirror to another world. [241]
The first note he played was not a note at all, but a whisper, a sound so soft it seemed to vanish the moment it left his lips. [273]
He shaped it through negative space, letting the silence between the notes carry the weight of what he could not say aloud. [300]

The prophecy had warned of a day when the city would drown in its own noise, when the voices of the past would be swallowed by the clamor of the present. [336]
Elias had heard it first as a child, hummed by his grandmother in a language he didn’t understand, though the melody had lodged in his bones like a splinter. [368]
Now, standing in the grotto, he understood: the only way to hush the prophecy was to play it back, to let the music absorb the words before they could take root. [405]
The saxophone’s reed trembled under his fingers, and the notes that followed were not his own—they were echoes, fragments of a song that had been waiting for him. [442]

The mist outside the grotto thickened, swirling in time with the music, and for a moment, Elias thought he saw shapes moving within it—faces he recognized, faces he had never known. [483]
The prism atrium’s light bent around him, casting rainbow shadows that danced across the stone, and the vested hush deepened, pressing against his skin like a living thing. [522]
He played until his lungs burned, until the whispers of the prophecy dissolved into the air, until the only sound left was the slow drip of water from the grotto’s ceiling. [564]
When he finally lowered the saxophone, the mist had lifted, and the city beyond the conservatory was just waking up, unaware of what had been averted. [601]

Elias packed his instrument away, the weight of the case now lighter, as if the music had taken something from him in return. [633]
The prophecy was still there, of course—it always would be—but for now, it was quiet. [655]
As he stepped back into the morning light, the prism atrium’s glow faded behind him, and the only trace of what had happened was the faintest hum in the air, like a held breath finally released. [697]
He walked away, knowing he would return when the mist called him again. [718]
The city breathed around him, oblivious, and Elias let it. [732]
Some silences were meant to be kept. [741]
