The grotto exhaled mist like a sleeping dragon, its serpentine walls glistening with damp that never quite dried. [16]
Liora knelt at the water’s edge, her fingers tracing the smooth curve of a piece of sea glass, its edges worn by years of relentless tide. [42]
She had found it years ago, back when the stars still felt close enough to touch, back when her nights were spent mapping constellations instead of mourning their absence. [78]
The glass was reflectively vibrant, catching the dim light of the grotto and scattering it in fractured hues across the stone. [104]

She had come here for the pearl of stillness. [113]
The elders spoke of it in hushed tones—a relic said to hold the quiet between heartbeats, the pause before a breath. [136]
Liora needed that stillness now, more than ever, because the memories were resurfacing like drowned things clawing their way back to the surface. [165]
The last time she had tried to share light without using fire, she had failed. [182]
The village had gone dark that winter, and her lanterns, meant to mimic the stars, had flickered out one by one. [206]
She had been too reckless, too eager to prove she could bring the sky down to earth. [226]

The sea glass weighed heavy in her palm. [235]
It was a reminder of what she had lost—her father’s voice, the way he had taught her to polish gems until they shone like captured moonlight. [264]
She missed the methodical rhythm of it, the way the dust from the polishing wheel settled on her skin like a second shadow. [290]
But more than that, she missed the way he had looked at her when she presented him with her first finished stone, his eyes bright with something like pride. [328]

The grotto’s water lapped at her knees as she waded deeper, the cold biting through the fabric of her robes. [350]
The pearl of stillness was said to rest at the heart of the grotto, where the mist coiled thickest and the walls pulsed with an eerie, bioluminescent glow. [386]
Liora had always been an earthbound star watcher, someone who sought the heavens but was tethered to the ground. [412]
Now, she sought something else—something that would let her share the light she carried without burning anyone, least of all herself. [443]

She found it nestled in a crevice, a perfect sphere of opalescent white, its surface unmarred by time. [465]
When she touched it, the world stilled. [474]
The mist stopped swirling, the water ceased its murmuring, and for a single, suspended moment, there was no sound, no movement, only the quiet hum of existence. [513]
Liora held her breath, afraid that even the smallest exhale might shatter the illusion. [534]

But the pearl did not break. [541]
Instead, it began to glow, a soft, steady light that seeped into her skin and settled in her bones. [567]
She understood then—this was how she could share light without fire. [585]
Not by forcing it, not by burning brighter, but by holding still, by letting the light reflect and refract through her, like the sea glass in her pocket. [621]

When she emerged from the grotto, the mist clung to her like a second skin. [638]
The village was waiting, their faces turned toward her in the dim predawn light. [660]
She held out the pearl, and it pulsed once, twice, before the glow spread outward, painting the world in hues of gold and blue. [692]
No one spoke. [695]
No one needed to. [699]

Liora smiled, her heart lighter than it had been in years. [715]
The memories were still there, but they no longer weighed her down. [730]
She had found a way to carry them, to let them shine without consuming her. [748]
And for the first time, she felt like the star watcher she had always meant to be—not just someone who looked up, but someone who brought the light down to earth. [789]
