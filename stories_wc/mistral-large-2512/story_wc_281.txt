The studio smelled of ozone and burnt sugar, a scent that clung to Mara’s skin long after the static shock had thrown her against the wall. [18]
She rubbed her shoulder, wincing, but her fingers lingered on the muscovite geode sliver in her pocket—its jagged edge fractally precise, catching the light like a promise. [48]
The accident had left her with more than bruises; it had left her with questions, the kind that hummed beneath her skin like a live wire. [79]

Mara had always been an affectionate skeptic, the type to hug you tightly while whispering, *"Prove it."* [97]
Her best friend, Eli, had laughed when she called the telepathy pill recall a scam, but now, after the shock, she wasn’t so sure. [124]
The pill had been in her system for weeks, a trial for a study she’d joined on a whim, and though she’d stopped taking it, fragments of other people’s thoughts still flickered at the edges of her mind. [161]
Not full sentences—just impressions, like the ghost of a touch. [173]

Eli had set up the light painting studio as a distraction, but Mara had come to devise a way to make sense of it all. [196]
She adjusted the blacklight, watching as the phosphorescent paint on the walls pulsed like a slow heartbeat. [216]
If the pill had rewired something in her, she needed to trace the pathways, to illuminate the hidden connections between thought and body. [243]

Through somatic markers, Eli had said. [250]
He’d read about it in some fringe neuroscience journal—how the body remembered what the mind forgot, how fear or joy left physical imprints like fingerprints on the nervous system. [287]
Mara pressed her palm to her sternum, where the static shock had hit hardest. [303]
If she could map the echoes of the pill’s effects, maybe she could reverse them. [320]

She picked up a brush, dipped it in glowing blue, and began to paint. [333]
Not on the walls, but on her own skin—lines tracing the path of the shock, fractally precise, branching like veins. [357]
The paint shimmered under the blacklight, a living map of her body’s memory. [373]

Eli watched from the corner, his expression unreadable. [382]
"You’re turning yourself into a canvas," he said. [392]
Mara didn’t look up. "I’m turning myself into a question." [402]

She swallowed another pill—this one placebo, she told herself—and closed her eyes. [418]
The studio dissolved into static, then reformed, sharper than before. [430]
She could see the pathways now, not just as lines on her skin but as threads of light, weaving through the air. [454]

One of them pulsed brighter than the others. [462]
Mara reached out, her fingers brushing against it. [472]
A memory surfaced—not hers, but someone else’s. [481]
A child laughing in a sunlit field, the warmth of grass beneath bare feet. [496]

She gasped, the brush slipping from her fingers. [505]
Eli was at her side in an instant. "What did you see?" [516]
Mara shook her head, the memory already fading like a dream upon waking. [531]
"It wasn’t mine," she whispered. [536]

The muscovite geode sliver in her pocket suddenly felt heavier. [548]
She pulled it out, holding it to the light. [556]
The fractures inside caught the glow, refracting it into a hundred tiny pathways. [573]

Maybe the pill hadn’t rewired her. [580]
Maybe it had only revealed what was already there. [590]
Hidden pathways, waiting to be illuminated. [598]

Mara picked up the brush again. [603]
This time, she painted not on her skin, but on the air itself, tracing the threads of light until they formed a shape—a map, a key, a door. [633]
Eli didn’t ask what she was doing. [641]
He just handed her another brush. [648]

The studio hummed with possibility, the static shock now just another part of the pattern. [668]
Mara smiled, the willowglass hope in her chest light as a feather. [682]
She wasn’t just devising a way to understand the pill. [694]
She was devising a way to live with it. [703]

The paint dried, but the pathways remained, glowing faintly in the dark. [718]
Mara took Eli’s hand, her fingers warm against his. [729]
"Prove it," she said, and this time, she believed. [740]
