The artist, Liora Vey, had never seen her own face—not in the way others did. [12]
Her condition, prosopagnosia, meant she recognized people by the tilt of their shoulders, the rhythm of their steps, the way light pooled in the hollows of their collarbones. [36]
It was why she painted portraits not of faces, but of the spaces between them: the negative air where a jawline met a throat, the fleeting shadow of a smile before it vanished. [69]
Tonight, she had come to the tree trunk library, a cavernous hollow in the heart of the Old Scholar’s Guild, its walls lined with books that smelled of damp paper and time. [103]
The building above was condemned, slated for demolition at dawn, and the guild had dispersed like leaves in a storm, leaving behind only the faintest traces of their presence. [139]
Liora ran her fingers along the spines of the books, each one a whisper of a life spent in pursuit of knowledge. [160]
She had come for the secret book safe, a relic of the guild’s final days, rumored to hold a single, fractally precise sketch of the sky—one that captured not just its color, but its movement, its breath. [199]
The safe was hidden somewhere in the library’s depths, its location known only through the faint indentations on a centuries-old coin passed down through generations of guild scholars. [236]
Liora had memorized the coin’s markings: a spiral of dots that, when pressed into wax, revealed a map of the tree’s veins, leading to the safe’s resting place. [265]
She pulled the coin from her pocket, its edges worn smooth by time, and traced the indentations with her thumb. [285]
The tree trunk library was silent except for the creak of settling wood and the distant hum of the city beyond its walls. [312]
Liora had always been drawn to stillness, to the moments just before something irrevocable happened—the hush before a storm, the pause before a breath. [342]
This place, with its towering shelves and the weight of centuries pressing down, was the perfect mirror of that stillness. [367]
She knelt, pressing the coin into a patch of soft wax she had brought, and waited for the map to reveal itself. [390]
The wax hardened, the spiral of dots now a clear path leading deeper into the library, toward a shelf obscured by shadows. [419]
Liora followed it, her pulse steady, her movements deliberate. [434]
She had spent her life crafting images that captured the essence of things unseen, and now she was doing the same with this moment, this quest. [464]
The secret book safe was exactly where the map said it would be: a hollowed-out tome with a lock so intricate it seemed to breathe. [492]
She turned the key—another relic of the guild—and the safe clicked open. [510]
Inside lay a single sheet of paper, its edges yellowed with age, and on it, a sketch so precise it made her chest tighten. [539]
The sky was not just blue; it was a thousand shades of blue, each one layered over the other like the petals of a flower. [562]
It was not just still; it was alive, the lines fractally precise, each stroke building upon the last until the whole became something greater than the sum of its parts. [599]
Liora had spent her life trying to mirror the sky inside walls, to capture its vastness in the confines of a frame. [626]
This sketch did more than that. [633]
It didn’t just depict the sky; it held it, like a vessel holds water. [651]
She understood then why the guild had hidden it away, why they had guarded its secret so fiercely. [674]
The sky was not something to be owned, but something to be revered, something that defied containment. [698]
And yet, here it was, trapped in ink and paper, as close to perfect as anything she had ever seen. [724]
Liora closed the safe, her fingers lingering on the sketch for just a moment longer. [742]
She would not take it. [747]
Some things were not meant to be possessed, only witnessed. [760]
As she stepped back into the library’s dim light, the first faint glow of dawn crept through the cracks in the walls. [783]
The building above would soon be gone, reduced to rubble, but this place, this moment, would remain. [806]
