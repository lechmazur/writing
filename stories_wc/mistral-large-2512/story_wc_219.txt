The rain had stopped just before dawn, leaving the tower’s stone steps slick with moss and the air thick with the scent of wet earth and blooming hawthorn. [23]
Elias Vey adjusted the strap of his satchel, the fly amber tucked inside pressing against his ribs like a secret. [42]
He had spent years dismissing the pilgrimage as a fool’s errand, a relic of superstition, but now, standing at the base of the rainwashed tower, he felt the weight of his own skepticism like a second skin. [82]
The amber—no larger than a thumbnail—glowed faintly in the dim light, its trapped insect suspended in golden time, a paradox he couldn’t ignore. [112]

The path ahead was a sculpture garden, its once-grand statues now half-swallowed by ivy and time. [133]
Dusty footprints marked the way, the imprints of those who had come before him, their motives as inscrutable as the weathered faces of the figures they passed. [163]
Elias followed them, his boots sinking slightly into the damp soil, each step a concession to something he couldn’t name. [188]
The tower loomed above, its windows dark, its purpose forgotten by all but the most academically rebellious. [213]

He had been one of them, once. [217]
At the university, he had scoffed at the idea of artificial pilgrimages, calling them a crutch for the spiritually lazy. [239]
But first contact had changed everything. [244]
The signals from the void had been undeniable, a pattern too precise to be natural, and when the translations came, they spoke of homecoming—not as a return, but as a chemical reaction, a binding of elements long separated. [287]
Elias had laughed at first, then spent sleepless nights in the lab, trying to replicate the conditions described. [313]
The fly amber was his last clue. [320]

The path converged at the tower’s entrance, where a dozen other footprints overlapped, some fresh, some so old the rain had nearly washed them away. [353]
Elias hesitated, his fingers brushing the amber through the fabric of his satchel. [369]
Inside, the tower was hollow, its walls lined with shelves of glass vials, each containing a different shade of dust. [391]
A woman stood at the center, her back to him, her hands moving deftly over a mortar and pestle. [415]
She turned, and Elias recognized her immediately: Dr. Liora Voss, the only other researcher who had taken the pilgrimage seriously. [443]

“You came,” she said, her voice low, bronze quiet. [453]
Elias swallowed. “I had to see if it was real.” [463]
Liora held up a vial, its contents shimmering like liquid copper. [477]
“It is,” she said. “But not in the way we thought.” [488]

She explained how the tower had been built by an ancient order of chemists who believed homecoming wasn’t a place, but a state—one achieved by mixing the right elements. [528]
The fly amber was the catalyst, its trapped insect a symbol of something caught between worlds. [552]
Elias listened, his skepticism warring with the evidence before him. [568]
The dust on the path, the vials on the shelves—it all pointed to a truth he had spent his life denying. [593]

“Why here?” he asked. [597]
Liora gestured to the tower’s open roof, where the spring sky stretched endlessly. [614]
“Because the rain washes away the noise,” she said. “And the quiet lets you hear what’s always been there.” [640]

Elias reached into his satchel and pulled out the amber. [652]
It pulsed faintly, as if in response to the tower’s energy. [668]
Liora took it, her fingers brushing his, and placed it into the mortar. [684]
The dust inside the vials began to glow. [694]

He understood then—the pilgrimage wasn’t about faith, but about chemistry. [713]
Homecoming wasn’t a return, but a reaction, a binding of the self to something greater. [735]
The tower wasn’t a destination, but a crucible. [745]

And as the first light of dawn spilled through the open roof, Elias felt the weight of his skepticism dissolve, replaced by something brighter, something like belief. [780]
