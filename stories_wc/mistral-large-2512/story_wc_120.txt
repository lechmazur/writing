The glass spire stood like a frozen breath against the pale dawn, its surface catching the first light in fractured prisms that scattered across the frozen lake below. [23]
Liora pressed her palm to the cold pane, watching her breath fog the surface, then vanish as quickly as it came. [46]
She had come here before exhaustion hit, before the weight of the world could drag her back into the numbness she’d spent years fleeing. [78]
The nautilus shell segment in her pocket was warm, as if it had absorbed the last of her body heat, or perhaps the last of her resolve. [110]

She had found it years ago on a beach in another life, when the horizon had still been a line she could cross, not a mirror trapping her in place. [149]
Now, the mirrored horizon stretched before her, the lake and sky indistinguishable, a perfect illusion of infinity. [176]
Liora had always been chronologically homesick—not for a place, but for a time when the future had felt like something she could shape, not something that shaped her. [216]

The fortune cookie writer’s words had been the first thing to make her pause in years. [237]
*"The conductor of unheard symphonies must first listen to the silence between notes,"* the slip had read, tucked into a stale cookie at a diner she’d wandered into at 3 AM. [275]
She had laughed then, bitter and sharp, but the words had stuck, burrowing into her like the shell in her pocket. [303]

Dawn was the only time the spire felt alive, when the light turned the glass into something molten, something that might still bend to her will. [338]
She had come to map her childhood memories, not as an act of nostalgia, but as a rebellion. [357]
If the horizon was a mirror, then she would crack it open by remembering what lay beyond it. [382]

Her first memory was of her mother’s hands, calloused and sure, pressing a seashell to her ear. [410]
*"Listen,"* she’d said, *"the ocean is still in there, even when you can’t see it."* [433]
Liora had believed her then, had believed in the magic of hidden things. [450]

The second memory was of the first time she’d seen the spire, years later, its glass surface reflecting not the sky but her own face, young and unlined, full of possibilities she hadn’t yet squandered. [499]
She had touched it then, too, as if she could absorb its permanence, its refusal to bend. [527]

The third memory was of the fortune cookie writer, though she’d never met him. [547]
She had collected his slips like talismans, each one a fragment of a puzzle she couldn’t solve. [572]
*"The past is a shadow, but shadows have edges,"* one had read. [591]
*"You are not lost; you are being rearranged,"* said another. [611]

Liora pulled the nautilus shell from her pocket and turned it over in her fingers, the spiral pattern a map of something she couldn’t name. [645]
The dawn light caught the ridges, casting tiny rainbows onto the glass. [666]
She pressed the shell to her ear, half-expecting to hear the ocean, but there was only silence—the kind that hummed, the kind that held symphonies. [702]

She closed her eyes and remembered the fourth thing: the first time she’d tried to conduct an orchestra. [731]
It had been a school play, a ragtag group of children with instruments they barely knew how to hold. [757]
She had waved her arms wildly, not because she knew what she was doing, but because she’d wanted to believe that sound could be shaped, that chaos could become music. [799]
The children had laughed, but for a moment, she had been the conductor of something, even if it was only noise. [830]

The horizon shimmered, the mirror cracking just a little. [843]
