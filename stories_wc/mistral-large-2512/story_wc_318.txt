The conductor stood at the mouth of the echo chamber tunnel, his baton replaced by the weight of a leaf blower in his hands. [17]
The pull cord handle dangled like a lifeline, frayed at the edges, whispering of countless starts and stops. [34]
After the final grain slipped through the hourglass, the world had gone quiet—too quiet, as if the air itself had been macerated into silence. [62]

His name was Elias Voss, though no one had called him that in years. [74]
He had once led symphonies, but now he conducted the wind, coaxing it through the tunnel’s curved walls until it hummed with the ghosts of forgotten melodies. [102]
The household at the tunnel’s end had not laughed in months, not since the accident that stole their youngest daughter’s voice. [126]
Elias knew the weight of unspoken things; he tended to them like a gardener to withered blooms, mournfully eager to see them flourish again. [153]

Tonight, the wind was off-key, but that was the point. [164]
He yanked the pull cord handle, and the leaf blower roared to life, its drone rising into a half-sung lullaby. [186]
The notes curled through the tunnel, bouncing between the walls until they swelled into something almost alive. [208]
Elias closed his eyes and let the sound carry him, imagining the household beyond—mother at the stove, father in the armchair, the empty chair where the girl once sat. [241]

The first time he’d done this, they had called the police. [254]
The second time, they had wept. [261]
Now, they listened. [265]

He adjusted the blower’s angle, letting the wind spiral deeper into the tunnel. [283]
The lullaby twisted, warped by the acoustics, but Elias didn’t correct it. [298]
The imperfections were the point—the cracks where the light, or in this case, the laughter, might seep through. [326]

A shadow moved at the tunnel’s far end. [335]
The girl stood there, her fingers pressed to her throat as if testing the air for sound. [356]
Elias’s breath hitched. [361]
He had never seen her before, only heard stories of her silence. [374]

The leaf blower sputtered, its fuel running low. [384]
He yanked the pull cord handle again, harder this time, and the engine coughed back to life. [406]
The lullaby resumed, softer now, but no less insistent. [419]

The girl took a step forward. [425]
Then another. [428]
Her lips parted, not in speech, but in something like wonder. [443]

Elias’s hands trembled. [448]
He had not come here to be seen, only to tend to the unspoken, to coax the laughter back from wherever it had fled. [476]
But the girl was here now, and the wind carried her closer, drawn by the off-key song. [499]

The mother appeared behind her, her face a map of grief and hope. [515]
She reached for the girl’s hand, and for the first time in months, her fingers did not flinch away. [540]

The leaf blower died with a final, shuddering gasp. [551]
Silence rushed in, but it was different now—softer, like the pause between breaths. [572]

The girl’s eyes met Elias’s. [580]
She didn’t speak, but her lips curved, just slightly, into the shape of a smile. [599]

The mother’s shoulders shook. [605]
Not with sobs, but with something lighter, something that had been buried too long. [628]
A laugh bubbled up from her throat, raw and rusty, but unmistakable. [645]

Elias exhaled. [648]
The pull cord handle slipped from his fingers, clattering to the ground. [662]
He had done what he came to do. [671]

The wind carried the sound of laughter back through the tunnel, bouncing between the walls until it filled the space like a symphony. [701]
Elias didn’t need to conduct it. [709]
It played itself. [713]

He turned and walked away, the echo of their joy following him into the dark. [732]
The unspoken had been tended to. [739]
The laughter had returned. [744]

And for now, that was enough. [751]
