The storm had been howling for three nights when Elias found the sextant. [12]
It lay half-buried in the damp sawdust of the tower’s lowest chamber, its brass limbs snapped like brittle twigs. [31]
Elias was a labyrinth maintenance worker, not an astronomer, but he recognized the instrument’s weight in his palm—the way it seemed to hum, though it was broken. [62]
The tower’s corridors were silent except for the distant drip of rainwater through cracked stone, but at that moment, he heard it: the faint *click* of a pin dropping somewhere above. [97]
He froze. [99]
No one else lived in the tower. [104]

Elias had been mapping the labyrinth for years, tracing the paths of its shifting walls with chalk and patience. [126]
But lately, the walls had begun to whisper. [134]
Not in words—never in words—but in the way they leaned toward him when he passed, as if remembering something. [156]
He had started leaving offerings in the crevices: a thimble of salt, a lock of his own hair, a scrap of paper with a child’s drawing of a tree. [184]
The tower, he suspected, was hungry. [190]

The sextant was new. [194]
Its gears were still bright, uncorroded by the tower’s damp. [206]
Elias turned it over in his hands, and moonlight—pale and precise—slid through the high windows, pooling on the floor like mercury. [231]
He knelt, pressing the broken instrument into the light. [242]
A warmth spread through his fingers, not the heat of the sun, but something older, something that knew the weight of years. [265]
His left hand had been numb since the accident in the lower levels, where a section of the labyrinth had collapsed on him. [287]
Now, sensation prickled back into his skin, like roots unfurling. [300]

Elias stood, the sextant heavy in his grip. [308]
He had come to the tower seeking answers, though he hadn’t known the question until now. [327]
The trees outside—gnarled oaks that had stood for centuries—had always watched him, their branches swaying in winds he couldn’t feel. [352]
What did they witness? [356]
Not just the tower’s rise and fall, not just the storms that lashed its stones, but the slow accumulation of sorrow, the way grief could be measured in rings, in cracks, in the silence between heartbeats. [397]
Quantified sorrow. [399]
That was what the sextant had been built to track. [407]

He climbed the spiral stairs, the sextant’s broken limbs catching the moonlight like a spider’s legs. [428]
The higher he went, the more the air hummed, not with sound, but with the weight of dreams left behind. [451]
A child’s lost mitten. [455]
A lover’s unspoken promise. [459]
A scholar’s abandoned theory. [463]
Elias had spent his life deconstructing the labyrinth, not with tools, but by mapping these scattered fragments, pressing them into the walls like mortar. [495]
The tower had been built to forget, but he was teaching it to remember. [512]

At the top, the storm raged, but the tower stood firm. [524]
Elias stepped onto the balcony, the sextant raised. [534]
The trees below swayed, their leaves whispering in a language of rustles and sighs. [553]
He adjusted the broken instrument, not to measure stars, but to measure the distance between what was lost and what remained. [581]
The moonlight healed him further, stitching together old wounds, old regrets. [598]
He thought of the pin he’d heard earlier—perhaps a needle dropped by a ghost, or a splinter of bone from the tower’s own ribs. [628]

Then, the sextant clicked. [633]
A gear turned, though no hand guided it. [642]
The broken limbs realigned, not into their original shape, but into something new: a map, not of the sky, but of the earth below. [671]
The trees’ roots spread across the metal like veins, their branches forming words in a script Elias almost recognized. [698]
*We remember the weight of the world,* they seemed to say. *We remember so you don’t have to.* [727]

Elias exhaled. [729]
The storm still howled, but the tower no longer felt like a prison. [743]
It was a vessel, a keeper of dreams, a place where sorrow could be measured and, in the moonlight, made whole. [770]
He tucked the sextant into his belt. [777]
Tomorrow, he would return to the labyrinth, to the walls that whispered and the corridors that shifted. [795]
But for now, he listened to the silence, to the *click* of the pin still falling somewhere in the dark. [818]
