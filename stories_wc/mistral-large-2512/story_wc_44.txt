The floating isle of Veythas drifted above the clouds like a forgotten dream, its nocturnal observatory perched at the highest peak. [18]
Liora Veyne, a budding rune scholar, adjusted the brass eyepiece of her telescope, her fingers tracing the ancient symbols etched into its frame. [44]
She had come here not for the stars, but for the shadows—the ones that vanished at noon, leaving no trace behind. [72]

The observatory’s walls hummed with latent energy, a remnant of the time after spoons bent reality, when the world had fractured and mended itself in strange new shapes. [108]
Liora had read the accounts: cutlery warping space, mirrors reflecting not images but entire moments, spoons twisting like serpents in the hands of those who dared to stir the unseen. [142]
But those were stories now, half-forgotten whispers in the archives. [155]
What mattered was the key in her pocket—a clockwork automaton key, cold and heavy, its teeth forming a pattern she couldn’t decipher. [182]

She had found it buried in the observatory’s foundation, alongside a journal written in a hand that wasn’t quite human. [208]
The entries spoke of sealed awakenings, of something dormant beneath the isle, waiting to be roused. [231]
Liora’s breath fogged the glass of the telescope as she turned the key over in her palm, her movements quietly deliberate. [257]
She had spent years studying runes, but this—this was different. [271]
The key didn’t just unlock doors; it unlocked time, or so the journal claimed. [288]

A shadow flickered at the edge of her vision. [298]
Liora turned, but there was nothing—only the observatory’s curved walls, lined with star charts and equations. [325]
She exhaled, her fingers tightening around the key. [336]
If shadows vanished at noon, where did they go? [347]
The question had haunted her since childhood, ever since she’d first noticed the way darkness seemed to dissolve into the light, as if swallowed by something unseen. [383]

The journal’s final entry had been a single sentence: *To find where shadows go, you must first relearn what they are.* [417]
Liora had spent weeks puzzling over those words, until she realized the answer lay in the observatory’s oldest records. [448]
The builders of Veythas hadn’t just studied the stars—they had studied the spaces between them, the gaps where light failed to reach. [482]
And they had left behind a puzzle, one that could only be solved by closing loops. [505]

She knelt beside the observatory’s central dais, where a circular depression marred the stone floor. [530]
The key fit perfectly. [536]
With a turn, the mechanism groaned to life, gears grinding as the dais sank into the earth, revealing a spiral staircase descending into darkness. [571]
Liora lit a lantern, its flickering glow casting long, wavering shadows on the walls. [594]

The air grew colder as she descended, the scent of ozone and old metal filling her lungs. [618]
At the bottom, she found a chamber lined with mirrors, each reflecting not her image, but fragments of moments—her childhood self staring at the noon sky, her younger hands tracing runes in the dirt, her voice whispering questions to the empty air. [678]
The mirrors weren’t showing the past; they were showing the shadows, the parts of her that had been lost to the light. [712]

A figure stood at the center of the chamber, its form shifting like smoke. [730]
It turned, and Liora recognized the face from the journal’s sketches—a guardian, or perhaps a prisoner, of the sealed awakening. [760]
"You’ve come to relearn," it said, its voice like wind through a cracked window. [782]
Liora nodded, the key burning in her palm. [793]
The guardian smiled, its edges blurring. "Then close the loop." [810]

She understood. [813]
The shadows didn’t vanish—they were absorbed, stored, waiting to be reclaimed. [833]
And the key wasn’t just a key; it was a bridge. [846]
Liora turned it in the air, and the mirrors shattered, their reflections spilling out like ink into water. [872]
The shadows rushed back into the world, whole again, and for the first time, she saw where they had been hiding. [906]

The guardian dissolved into the dark, its task complete. [920]
Liora climbed the stairs, the lantern’s light now steady, no longer flickering. [940]
Above her, the observatory’s dome split open, revealing the noon sun—but this time, the shadows didn’t disappear. [970]
They stretched long and true, unbroken. [978]

She smiled. [980]
The loop was closed. [985]
