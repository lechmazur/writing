The farmhouse stood crooked beneath the wind turbines, their blades slicing the sky like the hands of a clock that had forgotten how to keep time. [22]
Inside, Elias whittled a stick into something that might have been a bird, if he had ever seen one up close. [41]
His hands moved without thought, the knife steady despite the tremors in his wrists. [59]
The dried flower bouquet on the table had been there since the funeral, its petals brittle as old bone. [82]
No one had touched it, not even to dust. [91]

Elias was a blank-faced performer, though no one had asked him to perform in years. [109]
His face was a mask he had forgotten how to remove, smooth and unreadable as the porcelain dolls his mother used to collect. [132]
He spoke only when necessary, and even then, his voice was a flat line, devoid of inflection. [153]
The happiness mandate had come and gone, leaving behind a world where sorrow was a crime and joy was currency. [177]
But Elias had no currency to spend. [185]

That evening, he boiled water for tea, dramatically narrating each step as if reciting a eulogy. [205]
"First, the kettle is filled," he said, pouring from the tap with exaggerated care. [218]
"The flame is lit, low and steady, so as not to startle the water." [234]
His reflection in the window watched him, blank and unblinking. [246]
The turbines groaned outside, a sound like a dying breath. [258]

He had taken to this ritual after the mandate, when grief had become a private rebellion. [276]
To cultivate lightness in grief was his only motivation now, though he didn’t know if he was succeeding. [297]
The tea steeped, dark as the earth he had shoveled over his wife’s coffin. [315]
He stirred in honey, narrating the slow spiral of the spoon. [329]
"Sweetness is a choice," he murmured, though no one was listening. [345]

The dried flowers rustled as he sat down, their scent long faded. [358]
He had pressed them himself, the day after the burial, when the world was still soft with shock. [377]
Now they were just relics, like him. [385]
The tea burned his tongue, but he drank it anyway. [396]

Outside, the turbines cast long shadows over the fields, their blades carving the dusk into strips. [418]
Elias wondered if they were harvesting something, or if they were just spinning out of habit. [439]
He had once asked a technician why they never stopped, and the man had laughed. [458]
"Because the world needs power," he’d said, as if that explained anything. [474]

Elias wasn’t sure what the world needed anymore. [485]
He set the teacup down and picked up the whittled stick, turning it in his fingers. [502]
It was almost a bird now, or at least the idea of one. [515]
He placed it beside the bouquet, another offering to the silence. [529]

That night, he dreamed of his wife’s voice, though he couldn’t remember what she had sounded like when she was alive. [556]
In the dream, she was narrating the act of folding laundry, her tone light, almost playful. [577]
"The sheets are smoothed, the corners tucked just so," she said, and the sound of it was like a wound reopening. [602]
He woke with his face wet, though he hadn’t realized he was crying. [621]

The next morning, he boiled water again, narrating as he had the night before. [639]
This time, he spoke to the dried flowers, to the whittled bird, to the empty chair across from him. [662]
"Today, the tea is poured," he said, and the words felt heavier than they should have. [684]
The turbines groaned outside, a chorus of mechanical mourners. [699]

He didn’t know if he was cultivating lightness or just digging himself deeper into the void. [722]
But the ritual was all he had left, so he clung to it. [738]
The stick in his hand became a bird, then a tree, then nothing at all. [754]
The dried flowers crumbled a little more with each passing day. [769]
And Elias kept speaking, because silence was the one thing he couldn’t bear. [789]
[800]
