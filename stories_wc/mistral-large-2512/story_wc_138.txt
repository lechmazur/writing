The immortal known as Veyra had watched civilizations rise and fall like tides, their echoes fading into the silence of eternity. [17]
She sat in the heart of the prismatic escondite, a hidden sanctuary where light fractured into a thousand hues, painting the walls in shifting, iridescent patterns. [43]
The air hummed with latent energy, the kind that made her skin prickle with the awareness of unseen dimensions pressing against the edges of reality. [73]
She was dimensionally aware, a rare trait even among immortals, and it had made her both a scholar and a fugitive. [94]

The solar storm raged outside, its charged particles colliding with the escondite’s crystalline structure, amplifying the magnetic fields that pulsed through the hidden chamber. [125]
Veyra traced her fingers over the cursed amulet fragment resting on the table before her, its jagged edges glowing faintly with an eerie, violet light. [152]
It was said to be a piece of an ancient artifact, one that had once bound entire dimensions together—or torn them apart. [177]
She had stolen it from a dying warlock who whispered of a "spatial mutiny" before his last breath, a rebellion of realms against their own boundaries. [207]

Her motivation was simple, yet achingly profound: she wanted to discover what happens after goodbye. [225]
For an immortal, goodbyes were rare, and their aftermaths even rarer. [239]
She had outlived lovers, friends, and enemies, but the void left behind was always the same—empty, endless, and unknowable. [264]
The amulet fragment promised answers, or at least the illusion of them. [278]

A shadow moved at the edge of her vision, and Veyra tensed. [291]
The prismatic escondite was supposed to be impenetrable, yet someone—or something—had found her. [309]
The intrigue began not with words, but with a shift in the magnetic fields, a subtle distortion that made the air taste metallic. [334]
She reached for the amulet fragment, her fingers curling around its cold surface. [349]

A figure materialized from the fractured light, their form flickering like a mirage. [364]
"You shouldn’t have taken that," the stranger said, their voice a low rumble, like hushed thunder. [382]
Veyra recognized them instantly: Kael, a rogue dimension-walker who had once been her ally before vanishing into the void. [407]
His eyes gleamed with the same violet light as the amulet, and she knew he was after the same thing she was. [433]

"Why now?" she asked, keeping her voice steady. [442]
Kael smirked, the expression sharp enough to cut. [450]
"The solar storm is weakening the barriers between dimensions," he said. [464]
"It’s the perfect time for a spatial mutiny." [473]

Veyra’s grip tightened on the amulet fragment. [481]
She had spent lifetimes studying the boundaries of existence, but Kael had always been more reckless, willing to tear them apart for the sake of curiosity. [511]
"What do you want?" she demanded. [518]

Kael stepped closer, the magnetic fields warping around him like a cloak. [533]
"I want to see what lies beyond the last goodbye," he said. [546]
"The amulet fragment is the key, but it needs more than just power—it needs a catalyst." [566]
His gaze flicked to the storm outside, where the solar winds howled like a chorus of the damned. [586]

Veyra understood. [589]
The amulet fragment was not just a relic; it was a lock, and the solar storm was the key. [610]
But unlocking it would require a sacrifice—one she wasn’t sure she was willing to make. [630]
Kael seemed to read her hesitation. [637]
"You’ve always been too afraid to cross the line," he said. [650]
"But I’m not." [654]

With a sudden movement, he lunged for the amulet. [665]
Veyra reacted instinctively, slamming her palm against the fragment and channeling her dimensional awareness into it. [690]
The prismatic escondite trembled, the walls shimmering as the magnetic fields surged, pulling at the fabric of reality itself. [720]
Kael staggered back, his form flickering like a dying flame. [733]

"You don’t know what you’re doing," he snarled. [742]
Veyra didn’t answer. [745]
She could feel the amulet fragment burning in her hand, its curse spreading through her veins like wildfire. [769]
The solar storm outside reached its peak, the magnetic fields twisting into a vortex that threatened to swallow them both. [796]

And then, just as suddenly as it had begun, the storm quieted. [810]
The prismatic escondite fell still, the light dimming to a soft, steady glow. [827]
Kael was gone, vanished into the void he had sought to control. [840]
Veyra stood alone, the amulet fragment now cold and inert in her palm. [856]

She had her answer. [860]
After goodbye, there was only silence. [866]
But for the first time in eternity, she wasn’t afraid of it. [880]
