The signal station stood skeletal against the starlit sky, its rusted girders humming with the last whispers of the dead hydraulics. [18]
Elias, the patchwork navigator, adjusted the frayed straps of his coat as he stepped over the cracked concrete, his boots crunching on glass shards that had once been windows. [49]
The station had been abandoned after the hydraulics failed, its purpose—guiding ships through the shifting channels of the dried sea—rendered obsolete by the receding waters. [87]
But Elias wasn’t here for the ships. [94]
He was here for the geography of loss, the way the land remembered what had been taken from it, the way the moon pulled at the tides even when the tides were gone. [133]

The patina bronze censer foot sat heavy in his palm, its surface etched with symbols that fluctuated with the moon phases, fading in and out like breath. [165]
He had found it buried in the silt of the old harbor, where the last of the water had pooled before vanishing entirely. [190]
The censer was a relic of the reverse migration, the slow exodus of people who had once fled the drought only to return when the land refused to let them go. [227]
Elias traced the symbols with his thumb, feeling the ridges shift beneath his skin. [243]
They told him where to go, but never why. [253]

He had built his life through cryptic phone calls at midnight, static-laced voices murmuring coordinates and warnings. [277]
The first call had come on the night his sister disappeared, her voice a ghost in the receiver: *"Find the station where the stars still sing."* [308]
He had followed the instructions, and the calls kept coming, each one leading him deeper into the ruins of the old world. [339]
Now, the censer was warm in his hand, its weight anchoring him to the present. [356]

The station’s control room was a graveyard of dials and levers, their needles frozen mid-swing. [377]
Elias set the censer down on a metal desk, its base clicking against the surface. [396]
The symbols on its side glowed faintly, pulsing in time with the moon’s ascent. [417]
He had spent years deciphering their meaning, learning that the censer wasn’t just a map—it was a bridge. [445]
It connected the living to the lost, the present to the past, the way the reverse migration had connected the fleeing to the returning. [477]

Outside, the wind howled through the station’s skeletal frame, carrying the scent of salt and rust. [499]
Elias pulled a frayed notebook from his coat, its pages filled with sketches of the censer’s symbols and the routes they described. [530]
Each line was a memory, a path someone had taken before him. [546]
He had spent nights tracing them, building a network of stories from the fragments left behind. [569]

The phone rang at midnight, its shrill tone cutting through the silence. [587]
Elias answered without hesitation, pressing the receiver to his ear. [601]
*"The next call will come from the place where the water used to be,"* the voice whispered, then dissolved into static. [632]
He exhaled, his breath fogging in the cold air. [643]
The censer’s symbols had shifted again, their edges sharper now, pointing toward the horizon. [667]

He packed his notebook and the censer, leaving the station behind. [682]
The geography of loss was vast, but he was learning to navigate it, one midnight call at a time. [707]
The moon hung low, its light casting long shadows across the cracked earth. [727]
Elias walked toward it, the censer’s weight a comfort in his hand. [744]
The reverse migration had taught him that some paths weren’t meant to be left behind. [766]
They were meant to be rebuilt. [773]

The wind carried the sound of distant waves, though the sea was miles away. [792]
Elias smiled. [795]
The censer had led him here for a reason. [806]
He would find out what it was. [814]
[816]
