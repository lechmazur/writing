In the hollowed-out husk of the dimensional anchor, where the walls hummed with the weight of unspoken truths, Father Elias knelt before the altar of his own making. [23]
His loop pedal, a relic of a forgotten age, lay at his feet like a sleeping beast, its wires tangled in the silence he had so carefully cultivated. [52]
The priest was known as the loop pedal priest, not for his sermons—though they were many—but for the way he wove sound into stillness, layering whispers until they became a chorus of the unsaid. [94]
Tonight, however, the stillness had unraveled, fraying at the edges like a poorly stitched shroud. [115]

Before the possession completes, he had told himself, though he wasn’t sure who—or what—would claim him if it did. [140]
The thought sent a shiver through his spine, but he steadied his hands, reaching for the artist’s palette resting on the altar. [164]
It was an odd thing, that palette, its surface smooth except for the single smear of color at its center: a deep, bruised violet, the hue of twilight over a battlefield. [196]
He had found it years ago in the ruins of a collapsed studio, its other colors long since scraped away or faded into nothing. [226]
Now, it was all he needed. [234]

Father Elias pressed his thumb into the violet, smearing it across his lips like war paint. [254]
The act was ritual, a way to plumb the depths of his own hesitation. [269]
What assumptions had he buried beneath layers of silence? [279]
The question gnawed at him, sharp as a blade. [289]

He stood, the loop pedal clicking to life beneath his sandaled foot. [304]
The first layer of sound was his breath, a slow inhale that filled the chamber like a sigh. [324]
Then came his voice, not in words, but in a hum, low and resonant, vibrating through the dimensional anchor’s bones. [348]
The anchor was a place of convergence, a nexus where realities brushed against one another, and tonight, it thrummed in response. [375]

Through rhetorical devices, he shaped the silence. [382]
He let the hum linger, then repeated it, looping it back on itself until it became a drone, a foundation. [407]
Next, he added a whisper: *"What do you fear?"* [417]
The words echoed, distorted, layered over themselves until they lost meaning, becoming pure sound, pure emotion. [443]
The violet on his lips felt heavy, as if it were seeping into his skin. [458]

He decorates with silence, they said of him in the streets beyond the anchor. [471]
But silence was never empty. [477]
It was a canvas, and he was the painter, using sound to reveal what lay beneath. [498]
Tonight, though, the canvas was cracking. [507]

A new layer: the scrape of his nail against the palette, a sound so small it should have been swallowed by the drone. [534]
But it wasn’t. [537]
It cut through, sharp and deliberate, like a needle pricking skin. [554]
The anchor trembled. [557]

Father Elias closed his eyes. [561]
To illuminate hidden assumptions—that was his motivation, the reason he stood here, risking the unraveling. [586]
What if the possession wasn’t something to fear, but something to understand? [602]
What if the stillness wasn’t a void, but a mirror? [615]

He added one final layer: his own heartbeat, recorded earlier in the night, a steady *thump-thump* that pulsed through the anchor like a second rhythm. [653]
The violet on his lips burned now, not with pain, but with clarity. [671]
The muffled clarity of truth, half-heard, half-felt. [681]

The anchor groaned, its walls shifting as if breathing. [694]
Before the possession completes, he thought again, but this time, the words didn’t frighten him. [717]
They were an invitation. [722]

The loop pedal whirred, the layers of sound collapsing into a single, resonant chord. [741]
Father Elias opened his eyes. [747]
The violet had spread, staining his cheeks, his throat, his hands. [763]
The stillness wasn’t unraveled. [769]
It was revealed. [772]

And for the first time, he saw what it had been hiding all along. [788]
