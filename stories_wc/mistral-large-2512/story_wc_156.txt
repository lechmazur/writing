The mural had been silent for centuries, but Elias Voss heard its whispers in the pause between question and reply. [18]
He knelt on the scaffold, his breath fogging the glass barrier that separated him from the fresco’s faded blues and golds, his fingers hovering just above the surface like a pianist reluctant to strike the first chord. [56]
The sound wave garden outside the cathedral’s east wall had been his refuge since he took the restoration job—an expanse of parabolic dishes and resonant metal tubes arranged in spirals, designed to catch and amplify the city’s murmurs. [99]
Today, the garden hummed with the distant clatter of a hobo nickel tossed by a street performer, the coin’s ridges catching the light as it spun before vanishing into a beggar’s palm. [136]
Elias had seen the nickel before, or one like it: a buffalo’s face carved into the copper, its eyes hollowed out as if inviting something in. [164]
He turned back to the mural, where the archangel Gabriel stood frozen mid-gesture, his trumpet raised not to herald judgment, but to catch the echoes of something older. [198]

The restoration was supposed to be routine—clean the grime, stabilize the pigments, return the scene to its former glory. [222]
But the deeper Elias worked, the more the fresco resisted, its layers peeling back not to reveal the original, but something beneath it: a second mural, then a third, each nested inside the last like a series of Russian dolls. [261]
The first awakening had come when he brushed away the soot from Gabriel’s lips and heard, through the glass, the faintest vibration—a note that wasn’t there when he pressed his ear to the wall. [303]
The second awakening slithered into his bones as he realized the note was answering him, not from the mural, but from the garden outside, where the parabolic dishes had begun to tilt on their own, tracking the sound of his breath. [352]
The third awakening was the worst: the hobo nickel, now lodged in the crack between two stones at the base of the scaffold, its carved eyes reflecting not his face, but the archangel’s. [395]

Elias had always been methodically playful—his colleagues called it a flaw, this habit of turning every restoration into a game of "what if." [428]
What if the grime wasn’t just dirt, but a deliberate veil? [441]
What if the archangel’s trumpet wasn’t a trumpet at all, but a funnel for something else? [460]
He picked up the nickel, turning it over in his palm, and the moment his skin made contact, the garden’s dishes spun faster, their rims singing like a chorus of tuning forks. [497]
The sound wasn’t random; it was a language, or the shadow of one, bending around the edges of his understanding. [525]
He pressed the nickel to the glass, and the mural shivered. [537]

The archangel’s lips parted. [542]
Not in the fresco—Elias would have sworn to that—but in the reflection of the nickel, where Gabriel’s painted mouth stretched into a grin, his tongue a flicker of gold leaf. [579]
The sound wave garden amplified the movement, the dishes catching the vibration and hurling it back at the cathedral walls, where the echo bewitched the stone, turning it pliable as wet clay. [622]
Elias stumbled back as the scaffold groaned, the glass barrier cracking like ice on a pond. [648]
He had come to this city to restore certainty—to clean away the ambiguity, to reveal the truth beneath the grime. [678]
But the mural had other plans. [687]

The fourth awakening came when the archangel’s trumpet lifted from the wall, no longer paint, but metal, its bell flaring like a flower in fast motion. [723]
The sound it emitted wasn’t a note, but a question, one that coiled around Elias’s ribs and squeezed until his breath came in ragged gasps. [759]
The hobo nickel in his hand grew warm, then hot, its carved buffalo snorting steam. [780]
Elias understood then: the mural wasn’t a record of the past, but a door. [800]
And he had just been asked to step through. [808]
