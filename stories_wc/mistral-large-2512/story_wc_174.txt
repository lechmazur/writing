The decommissioned radar dome loomed over the coastal cliffs like a forgotten god, its rusted ribs groaning in the salt wind. [18]
Inside, the air was thick with the scent of old paper and lamp oil, the kind of stillness that follows a storm—or a heated argument. [40]
Liora Vey, an urbane calligrapher with ink-stained fingers and a reputation for unshakable composure, had chosen this place deliberately. [67]
The dome’s curved walls swallowed sound, leaving only the meteor hush of distant waves and the occasional creak of metal settling. [92]

She had come to reverse something. [97]
Not a mistake, not a regret, but the way stories were told—how they coiled around truth like ivy, choking it or letting it breathe. [123]
Her motivation was simple, if radical: to explore ethical storytelling, not as a lecture, but as a performance. [145]
And so, in the seediest bars of the port towns below, she staged subversive puppet shows. [163]
The puppets were crude, their joints stiff with glue, but their voices—oh, their voices were hers, woven from half-lit epiphanies and the kind of quiet revelations that only come when the world feels suspended. [198]

Tonight, though, she had brought her tools to the dome. [209]
A campfire story stick lay across her lap, its surface carved with symbols that shifted meaning depending on the light. [232]
She had found it years ago in a market stall, its previous owner long gone, and it had become her talisman. [252]
The stick was more than wood; it was a promise that stories could be living things, not just words on a page. [274]

Liora lit a single candle, its flame casting long shadows that danced like puppets on the dome’s inner curve. [294]
She had argued with her brother here, just days before. [305]
He had called her work frivolous, a distraction from the "real" art of calligraphy—precision, control, the unyielding line. [330]
But she knew better. [334]
Stories were how people made sense of the world, and if they were told carelessly, they could twist minds as easily as ink could stain paper. [364]

She picked up the story stick and traced its carvings with her thumb. [379]
The first symbol was a bird in flight, its wings spread wide. [392]
She had used it in her last puppet show, a tale about a fisherman who caught the same fish every day, only to realize the fish was his own reflection. [431]
The audience had laughed, then fallen silent, then argued—just as she’d hoped. [450]
That was the power of ethical storytelling: it didn’t just entertain; it unsettled. [468]

Liora exhaled, uncommonly serene despite the weight of her task. [483]
The dome’s acoustics made even her breath sound like a whisper from the heavens. [502]
She began to speak, her voice low and rhythmic, the words spilling out like ink from a broken nib. [526]
The story was about a woman who collected echoes, only to learn that every echo was a lie—someone else’s voice, someone else’s pain. [558]

As she spoke, the candle flickered, and the shadows on the wall shifted. [573]
The bird symbol on the stick seemed to move, its wings beating in time with her words. [593]
She wasn’t just telling a story; she was unraveling one, pulling at the threads of what people thought they knew. [622]
That was the reverse she sought: not to build narratives, but to question them. [641]

The argument with her brother had left her raw, but it had also clarified something. [660]
If stories were weapons, then she wanted to wield them with care. [677]
The dome, with its broken machinery and hollowed-out heart, was the perfect place for this work. [699]
It had once listened for enemies in the sky; now, it would listen to her. [718]

She finished the story and set the stick down. [730]
The candle guttered, and for a moment, the dome was plunged into darkness. [747]
Then, slowly, the light returned, softer now, as if the world itself had taken a breath. [771]
Liora smiled. [774]
The work was just beginning. [780]
