The floating observatory creaked like a dying beast, its rusted girders groaning under the weight of too many forgotten dreams. [16]
Lena crouched in the shadows, her breath shallow, the ghost of a drone’s hum still ringing in her ears—three years since the strike, and the sound never left. [46]
She had been a bride then, or almost one, her hands clutching a bouquet of wilting roses when the sky split open. [73]
Now, she hunted. [75]

The observatory’s dome loomed above, its fractured glass panes filtering the pale moonlight into jagged shards. [99]
She wasn’t here for stargazing. [104]
The geode crystal in her pocket pulsed faintly, its rough exterior hiding veins of something luminous, something alive. [130]
She had found it in the wreckage of a lab, half-buried in the rubble of a collapsed server farm. [152]
The scientists had called it an "unfiltered awakening"—a relic that could amplify what was already there, raw and unchecked. [176]
Lena didn’t understand the theory, but she understood the hunger in its hum. [191]

The circuit breakers below her feet hissed as they cooled, their heat bleeding into the metal grating. [212]
She had minutes, maybe less, before the system reset and the alarms blared to life. [234]
Perturbation theory, the lab’s last log had whispered. [246]
A way to nudge the unseen, to make the intangibly tangible. [262]
Lena didn’t know the math, but she knew loss. [272]
She knew the way grief pooled in the hollows of her bones, thick and heavy, waiting to be tapped. [294]

The observatory’s central chamber was a graveyard of abandoned equipment, screens flickering with static, their data long since corrupted. [323]
She moved through the detritus, her fingers brushing against the geode. [339]
It was warm now, almost feverish. [346]
She didn’t know where unused potential pooled, but she knew it wasn’t in the sky. [368]
It was in the cracks of the world, in the spaces between what was and what could have been. [394]
Her wedding dress had been white, pristine, until the fire turned it to ash. [414]
Now, she wore its remnants like a second skin, the charred lace clinging to her like a memory. [440]

A sound—metal scraping against metal. [447]
Lena froze. [449]
The observatory wasn’t empty. [454]
Something moved in the darkness, its form shifting like smoke. [470]
She had heard the stories—ghosts of the failed experiments, echoes of the scientists who had tried to harness the geode’s power and been consumed by it. [508]
But she wasn’t afraid. [514]
Fear was a luxury she had burned away long ago. [529]

The geode flared in her palm, its light casting long, wavering shadows. [549]
The thing in the dark recoiled, its edges blurring as if struggling to hold shape. [572]
Lena stepped forward, her voice a rasp. [580]
"Show me." [583]
The geode pulsed again, and the air between them rippled, like heat off pavement. [607]
The intangibly tangible—grief made manifest, potential given form. [623]

The thing solidified, its features resolving into something almost human. [642]
A man, or what was left of one, his body flickering like a dying bulb. [662]
He had been a scientist, once. [670]
His name was on the logs, the last entry scrawled in frantic handwriting: *"It’s not just energy—it’s choice."* [699]
Lena’s breath hitched. [704]
She had come here to hunt, but she hadn’t expected to find answers. [723]

The geode’s light dimmed, the man’s form dissolving back into the dark. [740]
The circuit breakers below her clicked, the system rebooting. [753]
Alarms wailed, red lights flashing. [761]
Lena clutched the geode tighter, its heat searing her skin. [775]
She didn’t know where unused potential pooled, but she knew where it led. [796]
Back to the wreckage, back to the fire, back to the moment the sky had torn open and taken everything. [824]
The observatory trembled, its rusted bones groaning as she ran. [840]
The hunt wasn’t over. [844]
It had only just begun. [849]
