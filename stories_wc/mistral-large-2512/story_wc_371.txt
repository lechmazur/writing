The first frost had settled over the city by the time Elias noticed the bakery was gone. [12]
Not in the way things vanish overnight—boarded windows, a "For Sale" sign—but in the slow, creeping way of things that slip from memory before they’re truly absent. [35]
He had passed the shop every morning for years, its warm scent of yeast and cinnamon threading through the cold air like an unspoken promise. [62]
Now, the space was a hollow shell, its shelves bare, its oven cold, as if it had never existed at all. [83]

Elias was a creeping normality noticer, the kind of man who saw the world in the gaps between what was and what had been. [109]
He had spent his life cataloging these slippages: the way the river’s edge had receded another inch each spring, how the old clocktower’s chime had grown just a fraction slower with every passing year. [147]
But the bakery’s disappearance unsettled him more than the rest. [158]
It wasn’t just that it was gone—it was that no one else seemed to remember it at all. [175]

He carried a loaf of its bread in his satchel, the last one he’d bought before the place emptied. [193]
It was dense and dark, studded with walnuts and dried figs, its crust still faintly warm even days later. [215]
He broke off pieces absently as he walked, the taste a ghost of something he couldn’t name. [232]
Perhaps that was why he found himself turning down the overgrown path leading to the old palace courtyard, where the secret tea house was said to still stand. [260]

The courtyard was a tangle of ivy and moss, the stone walls half-swallowed by time. [277]
Birds had long since flown south, leaving the branches bare, but the air hummed with the quiet industry of roots and seeds, the slow work of decay and renewal. [310]
Elias pushed aside a curtain of vines and stepped into the tea house, its low ceiling strung with dried herbs, its tables worn smooth by generations of hands. [343]
A woman sat in the corner, her fingers tracing the rim of a chipped cup. [358]

“You’re late,” she said, though no one had told him to come. [371]
Her voice was heuristically gentle, the kind of softness that didn’t demand attention but invited it anyway. [393]
Elias sat across from her, placing the bread between them like an offering. [409]
“I think I’m looking for absolution,” he admitted. [420]
The word felt too heavy, too deliberate, but she only nodded, as if she’d been expecting it. [444]

“Absolution isn’t given,” she said. “It’s grown.” [455]
She reached into her apron and pulled out a handful of seeds, their shapes unfamiliar, their surfaces rough with promise. [477]
“Through guerrilla gardening,” she explained. “You plant what’s needed where it isn’t wanted, and you let it take root.” [503]

Elias frowned. [506]
“That’s not absolution. That’s just… gardening.” [518]
She smiled, and in the dim light, her face was all sharp angles and quiet knowing. [540]
“Isn’t it?” [543]
She slid the seeds toward him. [550]

Outside, the world was still cold, still forgetting. [562]
But the bread on the table was real, the seeds in his palm were real, and the tea house—this fragile, hidden thing—was real too. [590]
Elias thought of the bakery, of the way its absence had settled into the city like a held breath. [616]
Perhaps the sacred wasn’t in the grand gestures, but in the stubborn persistence of things that refused to be erased. [645]

He uncloaked the truth then, not with words, but with his hands. [660]
He took the seeds and pressed them into the earth beneath the tea house’s window, where the soil was dark and rich with the compost of fallen leaves. [695]
The woman watched, her expression unreadable, as he patted the dirt down with the same care he might have given a wound. [728]

“What will grow?” he asked. [736]
She poured him tea, the steam curling between them like a question. [752]
“Something that wasn’t there before,” she said. [763]

Elias drank, and for the first time in months, the weight in his chest felt lighter. [783]
Not gone, but tenuous—like absolution, like the first green shoot pushing through thawing earth. [808]
Outside, the wind carried the scent of damp soil and distant smoke, and somewhere, a bird called, though it wasn’t the season for it. [830]
