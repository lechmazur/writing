The last embers of the old dynasty’s pyres still smoldered when Nabu-sharru, the frugal astronomer, slipped through the cracked bronze gates of the Ishtar Palace. [18]
His sandals whispered over lapis lazuli tiles, each step measured to avoid the watchful eyes of scavengers who picked at the bones of empire. [41]
Between regimes, the palace was neither dead nor alive—its halls hummed with the dusky harmony of forgotten rituals, the air thick with myrrh and the faint scent of cedar oil seeping from cracked urns. [82]
Nabu-sharru had spent his life counting stars, not coins, yet his frugality was not born of greed but necessity; every shekel saved bought another night’s study, another scroll, another chance to decode the heavens’ encrypted devotion. [132]

In his satchel, wrapped in frayed linen, lay the magic square tile—a relic of the deposed king’s personal sorcerer, its surface etched with numbers that shifted when viewed from different angles. [168]
The tile was empirically ironic: a tool of divination that defied logic, its patterns rearranging like constellations caught in a god’s breath. [192]
Nabu-sharru had stolen it not for power, but for proof. [204]
If the tile’s schematic representations held the key to the stars’ true names, then perhaps the unknown—those celestial forces the old priests had whispered of—could be bargained with, sealed in a covenant that would outlast the coming chaos. [252]

He uncloaked the tile in the throne room’s dim light, its surface flickering like a dying candle. [275]
The palace’s new masters, a warlord’s mercenaries, had not yet claimed this space; their laughter echoed from the courtyards, crude and loud, but here, in the heart of the old world, silence reigned. [318]
Nabu-sharru traced the tile’s grooves with a trembling finger, reciting the incantation he had pieced together from fragmented tablets. [345]
The numbers glowed faintly, pulsing in time with his heartbeat. [358]

A shadow detached itself from the wall—a figure clad in robes the color of twilight, its face obscured by a veil woven from starlight. [387]
"You seek to bind what cannot be bound," the figure said, its voice like wind through reeds. [410]
Nabu-sharru did not flinch. "I seek only to understand," he replied, "to seal a covenant that does not demand blood, only truth." [448]
The figure tilted its head, considering. "The old ways are broken. The new ones do not listen." [468]
"That is why I come now," Nabu-sharru said, "between regimes, when the world is neither one thing nor the other." [497]

The tile’s glow intensified, its patterns resolving into a map of the night sky—not as it was, but as it would be in a thousand years. [531]
The figure extended a hand, and Nabu-sharru placed the tile upon its palm. [551]
"Your devotion is encrypted in your frugality," it murmured, "in the way you hoard knowledge as others hoard gold." [580]
The tile dissolved into light, threading into the figure’s fingers like liquid silver. [599]
"Then you accept?" Nabu-sharru asked, his voice barely above a whisper. [615]

The figure did not answer. Instead, it turned toward the throne, where a single star descended through the ceiling’s oculus, hovering above the empty seat. [647]
"Look," it said. [651]
Nabu-sharru followed its gaze. [657]
The star was not a star at all, but a mirror—one that showed not his reflection, but the palace as it would stand in an age unborn: its walls whole, its halls filled with scholars, its gates open to the wise. [699]
"Your covenant is not with the unknown," the figure said, "but with the future." [723]

The mercenaries’ shouts grew louder, their torches flickering in the corridors. [742]
Nabu-sharru understood then—the tile had never been a tool for binding the heavens, but for preserving what mattered when empires crumbled. [775]
He bowed his head. "Then let it be sealed." [786]

The figure pressed its palm to his forehead, and the star’s light filled his vision, warm as dawn. [809]
When the mercenaries burst into the throne room moments later, they found only an old astronomer kneeling before an empty seat, his hands clutching a single, unremarkable shard of clay. [846]
