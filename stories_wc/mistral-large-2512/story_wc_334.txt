The first time Elias Voss saw the fairy ring mushroom, he was twelve years old, crouched in the mud of his grandfather’s sunken orchard greenhouse, its glass panes long shattered by time and tide. [28]
The ring of pale, umbrella-like caps glowed faintly in the dim light filtering through the algae-choked water above, as if lit from within by some forgotten magic. [64]
Elias, chronically curious even then, had spent years documenting the orchard’s slow descent into the bay, but this—this was different. [90]
It wasn’t just the mushroom’s eerie luminescence or its perfect, unbroken circle that unsettled him; it was the way it seemed to hum, a low vibration that thrummed through his bones when he pressed his palm to the damp earth. [136]

Decades later, Elias stood at the edge of the same greenhouse, now a skeletal frame half-buried in silt, its once-lush trees reduced to gnarled stumps. [167]
The shipwrecks that ringed the orchard like silent sentinels had become part of the landscape, their rusted hulls draped in kelp and barnacles. [193]
He had returned not out of sentimentality, but because his habits had broken—his meticulous note-taking, his obsessive cataloging of folklore, all of it had stalled the day he realized he couldn’t remember the summer he turned thirteen. [239]
The gap in his memory was a black hole, swallowing every detail except the fairy ring and the way it had pulsed beneath his fingers. [268]

Elias had spent years trying to recover those stolen memories, poring over old journals, interviewing villagers who’d known his grandfather, even tracking down the last surviving member of the coastal preservation society. [308]
But no one remembered the greenhouse before it sank, or the strange mushrooms that grew in its shadow. [326]
It was as if the orchard—and whatever had happened there—had been scrubbed from history. [346]

Then, three nights ago, Elias had detected a pattern in the stars. [358]
Not the constellations themselves, but the way they were broken—gaps where no light should be, as if something had reached up and plucked the stars from the sky. [392]
He had studied them for hours, cross-referencing old astronomical charts with his grandfather’s weather-beaten almanacs, until the truth dawned on him: the missing stars aligned with the fairy ring’s circumference. [438]
It was a map, he realized, a celestial breadcrumb trail leading back to the greenhouse. [462]

Now, wading through the knee-deep water, Elias followed the line of the broken constellations, his breath fogging in the cold salt air. [492]
The fairy ring was still there, its mushrooms larger now, their caps spread wide like open palms. [516]
He knelt, ignoring the way the water seeped into his boots, and pressed his fingers to the earth. [540]
The hum returned, louder this time, a resonant chord that vibrated through his skull. [564]

Memories surged forward—not in images, but in sensations: the weight of a small body in his arms, the metallic tang of blood in his mouth, the desperate whisper of a voice he couldn’t place. [608]
Elias gasped, his vision swimming as the fragments slotted into place. [624]
He had been thirteen, yes, but not alone in the greenhouse. [638]
His younger sister, Liora, had been with him, her hands trembling as she traced the fairy ring’s edge. [662]
She had been the one to tell him about the mushrooms, about how they were doorways, about how something had come through one summer night and taken her. [700]
Elias had tried to stop it, had fought until his knuckles split, but the thing had been too fast, too strong. [730]
And then—nothing. [733]

The hum crescendoed, and Elias realized with a jolt that the fairy ring was opening, its mushrooms folding inward like a closing iris. [767]
A figure stepped through, small and pale, her dark hair streaked with silver. [790]
Liora. [791]
She smiled, but her eyes were hollow, her skin translucent, as if she were only half there. [817]
"You took too long," she said, her voice like the tide pulling away from shore. [839]
And then the greenhouse groaned, the last of its glass panes shattering as the water rushed in. [864]
Elias reached for her, but the fairy ring snapped shut, and she was gone. [883]
The only thing left was a single mushroom cap, floating on the surface of the water, its glow fading into the dark. [912]
