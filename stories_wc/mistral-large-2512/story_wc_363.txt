The loom spinner sat on the warped porch of her cottage, fingers tracing the frayed edges of a half-woven shawl. [16]
Her name was Elara, though no one had called her that in years—not since the orchard had begun to forget itself. [35]
The bamboo forest whispered around her, its stalks stoically sparkling under the pale moonlight, their leaves trembling like the last notes of a forgotten song. [67]
She had spent decades spinning thread from the orchard’s dying silk trees, each strand a memory, each knot a regret. [89]
Now, the silence was raveling around her, thick as wool, and she knew it was time to recommence what she had long abandoned. [116]

In the corner of the cottage, a rummage sale box sat beneath a layer of dust. [133]
Elara had found it years ago, tucked between the roots of an ancient peach tree, its contents spilled like the guts of some long-dead traveler. [158]
She knelt and sifted through the fragments—yellowed letters, a rusted locket, and, at the very bottom, a jigsaw puzzle, its edges worn but unbroken. [185]
The pieces fit together in her mind before her hands could move them, forming a map of the orchard as it once was: vibrant, alive, humming with voices. [215]
She pressed a single tree sap amber bead into the center of the puzzle, where the oldest tree stood. [234]
The bead glowed faintly, as if remembering sunlight. [243]

Elara had not left the orchard in thirty years. [253]
The world beyond the bamboo was a blur of noise and forgetting, and she had chosen the raveling silence instead. [274]
But the message had found her anyway, carried on the wind like a thread pulled loose from the loom of time. [297]
It was a name—*Kael*—and a place—*the city of spires*—and a plea: *Come before the last light fades.* [322]
She did not know who had sent it, only that the amber bead had hummed when she held it to her ear, as if the voice were trapped inside. [350]

The orchard was deep in the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry, where even the peaches ripened in silence. [374]
Elara wrapped the shawl around her shoulders, its threads still damp with her own breath. [391]
She would carry the message across impossible distance, not because she believed in its hope, but because the alternative was to let the silence swallow her whole. [426]
The puzzle map guided her steps, its edges sharp against her palm. [443]

At the edge of the bamboo forest, she paused. [453]
The path ahead was a tangle of roots and mist, the city of spires a rumor beyond the horizon. [473]
She thought of the loom, of the threads she had left unfinished, of the way the orchard would forget her by morning. [498]
But the bead in her pocket was warm, and the message was a weight she could not set down. [520]
With a breath, she stepped forward, the bamboo stalks stoically sparkling behind her like sentinels of a world that no longer needed her. [551]

The journey was long. [556]
She followed the puzzle’s edges through valleys where the wind carried no sound, across rivers that reflected only the sky. [583]
At night, she slept with the bead pressed to her chest, dreaming of a voice that was not hers. [606]
When she finally reached the city of spires, its towers were crumbling, its streets empty save for the echoes of her own footsteps. [635]
The last light was fading, just as the message had warned. [650]

In the heart of the city, she found him—Kael, or what was left of him. [666]
He was a skeleton in a tattered cloak, his fingers curled around a loom identical to hers. [688]
At his feet lay a half-finished tapestry, its threads unraveling into the dark. [707]
Elara knelt and pressed the amber bead into his palm. [721]
It glowed once, brightly, then dimmed, and the silence between them was no longer raveling—it was complete. [747]

She understood then: the message had not been for him. [759]
It had been for her, a thread pulled from the past to weave her back into the world. [780]
The loom in the orchard would remain unfinished, the shawl unworn, the bamboo forest stoically sparkling without her. [806]
But the silence was no longer a weight. [815]
It was a beginning. [818]
