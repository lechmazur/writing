The quarry yawned beneath the mist, its jagged walls swallowing the last of the daylight. [14]
Elara Voss adjusted her spectacles, the lenses fogging slightly in the damp air, and traced the outline of a half-finished sketch in her notebook. [38]
She had been face blind since birth, but her hands remembered every contour, every shadow—her fingers were her eyes when memory failed. [67]
Tonight, the quarry wasn’t just stone and silence; it was a crime scene, one the police had abandoned years ago. [91]

The ribbon fragment lay between two rocks, its frayed edges catching the dim light like a whisper. [113]
Elara picked it up, the satin cool against her skin, and turned it over in her palm. [130]
Masquerade masks left such ribbons behind, tangled in hair or torn in struggle. [146]
This one was pale blue, the kind worn at the Winter Gala, the same gala where Liora Vex had vanished six years ago. [170]

The case had gone cold after the evidence box was misplaced—no fingerprints, no body, just a single witness who swore they’d seen Liora arguing with a man in a silver mask. [203]
Elara had read the files a hundred times, her methodical mind dissecting every detail. [218]
But method alone couldn’t solve this. [224]
She needed something more. [228]

A rustle in the mist made her freeze. [235]
She turned, her breath shallow, and saw a figure standing at the quarry’s edge. [252]
Tall, cloaked in gray, the mist curling around their boots like smoke. [267]
“You’re the artist,” the figure said, voice low. [276]
Elara nodded, her fingers tightening around the ribbon. [285]

“You draw the dead,” they continued. [291]
Not a question. [293]
“Only when they’re forgotten,” Elara said. [301]
The figure stepped closer, the mist parting for them like a curtain. [316]
“I knew Liora,” they said. [322]
“She was my sister.” [327]

Elara’s pulse quickened. [331]
The witness had never mentioned a sibling. [338]
“Why come to me?” she asked. [344]
“Because you see what others don’t.” [351]
The figure reached into their cloak and withdrew a lance—old, rusted, its tip jagged. [369]
“This was found here,” they said. [376]
“Buried under the rocks where the police never looked.” [389]

Elara’s stomach twisted. [393]
A lance wasn’t a weapon of passion; it was a weapon of precision, of calculated force. [414]
“Who would use this?” she asked. [422]
The figure’s gaze darkened. [427]
“Someone who wanted to make sure she never spoke again.” [442]

The pieces clicked together in Elara’s mind. [449]
The masquerade, the ribbon, the lance—opposites unified by violence. [464]
A party of frivolity, a weapon of brutality. [472]
“You think the killer was someone she knew,” Elara said. [485]
“Someone who could get close.” [492]

The figure nodded. [496]
“Liora was investigating corruption in the city’s elite,” they said. [513]
“She thought she was safe because she was one of them.” [528]
Elara’s fingers traced the ribbon again, the satin now slick with her sweat. [547]
“But she wasn’t.” [551]

The mist thickened, swallowing the quarry’s depths. [561]
Elara looked down at her sketchbook, at the half-finished portrait of Liora’s face—reconstructed from photographs, from the memories of those who loved her. [592]
She had drawn her a hundred times, but this time, something was different. [610]
The eyes in the sketch seemed to hold a question. [622]

“What do you want from me?” Elara asked. [631]
The figure knelt, placing the lance between them like an offering. [646]
“For her to be seen,” they said. [654]
“Not just as a victim. [661]
As a person.” [664]

Elara understood then. [668]
The cold case wasn’t just about justice. [675]
It was about empathy—awakening it in those who had forgotten, who had moved on. [694]
She took the lance, her grip firm, and added it to her sketch. [709]
The weapon’s curve became part of Liora’s story, a dark line against the light of her remembered smile. [733]

The figure stood, the mist swallowing their silhouette. [743]
“Thank you,” they said. [747]
Elara didn’t look up. [751]
She was already drawing, her hand moving with the precision of memory, of purpose. [770]
The quarry’s shadows stretched long, but in her sketchbook, Liora’s face was finally whole. [791]
