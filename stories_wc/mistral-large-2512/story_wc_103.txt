The hedge maze designer had always known the garden was alive, but she had never expected it to remember her. [16]
Her name was Elara Vey, and for thirty years she had shaped the living bridge garden’s labyrinthine paths, coaxing ivy into arches and willow roots into staircases that spiraled into the earth. [52]
The garden was a place where time bent, where the past and present grew into each other like vines, and where the air hummed with the weight of memories not yet faded. [89]
But lately, the photographs in her cottage had begun to pale, their edges curling as if burned by an unseen flame. [114]
The oldest ones—her parents, her first lover, the child she had lost—were nearly translucent now, their faces dissolving into the grain of the paper. [146]
Elara had spent a lifetime studying the texture of time, but she had never thought it would unravel so visibly, so *personally*. [175]

She found the halo fragment on a Tuesday, half-buried in the soil of the central bridge. [193]
It was no larger than her palm, a shard of golden light that pulsed faintly when she touched it, warm as a heartbeat. [220]
The garden’s oldest trees whispered when she lifted it, their leaves trembling not from wind but from recognition. [242]
Elara knew what it was immediately—an artifact from the retrocognitively trapped, those souls who had become snagged in the threads of history, unable to move forward or back. [278]
She had read about them in forbidden texts, their existence a paradox: alive in the past, yet lingering in the present like a stain. [308]
The fragment was a piece of their prison, a sliver of the cage that held them. [325]

That night, she pressed the shard to one of the fading photographs. [338]
The image of her daughter—small, smiling, holding a daisy—shuddered, then *reversed*. [356]
The petals of the flower curled inward, the child’s grin melted into a scream, and the background blurred into a scene Elara had never witnessed: a crowded street, gas lamps flickering, the air thick with the scent of rain and something older, something *wrong*. [406]
She gasped, jerking her hand away. [415]
The photograph darkened, the edges blackening as if scorched by time itself. [435]

The garden was calling to her. [442]
She followed the sound through the maze, the hedges shifting subtly to guide her, their leaves brushing her arms like fingers. [470]
At the heart of the labyrinth stood the oldest willow, its roots twisting into the shape of a doorway. [496]
Beyond it, the air shimmered, warped as if viewed through a lens of hyperbolic geometry. [520]
Elara stepped through. [524]

The world on the other side was not a place but a *moment*, stretched thin and endless. [548]
She stood in the street from the photograph, the same gas lamps casting long shadows, the same damp air clinging to her skin. [572]
But the people here were not people—they were echoes, their forms flickering like candle flames, their voices overlapping in a chorus of half-remembered words. [610]
And then she saw *her*. [616]
A woman in a long coat, her face familiar in the way of a dream half-forgotten. [640]
Elara’s mother. [643]
Not as she had known her, but as she had been *before*—young, terrified, clutching a bundle to her chest. [672]
The bundle moved. [675]
A child. [677]
Elara’s breath caught. [682]

The woman turned, her eyes widening. [690]
"You shouldn’t be here," she whispered, her voice layered with decades of grief. [710]
"I know," Elara said, her own voice trembling. [721]
The photograph had been a warning, a door left ajar. [736]
The retrocognitively trapped were not just souls—they were *events*, moments that refused to end. [760]
Her mother had died in this street, her daughter stolen by time before she could be born. [785]
And now Elara stood in the wreckage of that loss, the halo fragment burning in her palm. [810]

The garden had let her see. [817]
But seeing was not enough. [823]
She had to *fix* it. [827]
Elara pressed the fragment to her mother’s chest. [838]
The woman’s form began to disintegrate, not into nothingness, but into light, into *time*, her edges fraying like the photographs in Elara’s cottage. [877]
The street wavered, the gas lamps guttering out. [890]
And then—silence. [894]

Elara woke in the garden, the willow’s roots cradling her like a child. [912]
The photographs in her cottage were whole again, their colors vivid, their edges sharp. [933]
But the halo fragment was gone, and so was the woman in the street. [950]
Elara touched her face, her hands. [958]
She was older now, but not in the way of years. [971]
She had touched the texture of time, and it had touched her back. [990]
The garden hummed around her, its leaves quaking with reverie. [1005]
She would design new paths tomorrow. [1012]
But for now, she let the past rest. [1022]
