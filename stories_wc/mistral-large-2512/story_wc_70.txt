The lightning collection tower loomed over the city like a skeletal sentinel, its copper veins still humming with residual charge after the blackout. [19]
Elias, the toll keeper at its base, leaned against the rusted gate, his fingers tracing the edges of a lacquer box he’d found wedged between the cobblestones. [47]
The box was warm, as if it had absorbed the last of the storm’s fury, and its surface shimmered with a patina of gold and crimson. [76]
He shouldn’t have opened it—toll keepers were supposed to report lost property, not hoard it—but the weight of the thing in his palm felt like a secret begging to be kept. [109]

Inside, nestled in velvet, was a matchbox. [116]
Elias flicked it open with his thumb, and a slip of paper uncoiled like a tongue. [130]
*"When the sky forgets its name, strike the spark that remembers,"* it read, the ink smudged as if written in haste. [153]
He frowned. The city-wide blackout had left the streets in a hush, the usual drone of beehives silenced—something was wrong with them, the workers had muttered, their wings too heavy with static. [186]

Elias was involuntarily truthful, a curse that had cost him jobs before this one. [200]
If someone asked him a direct question, he couldn’t lie, not even to spare feelings. [215]
It made him a terrible liar but an excellent toll keeper, because no one ever doubted his word. [232]
Now, as he turned the matchbox over, he felt the truth clawing up his throat: the riddle wasn’t just words. [251]
It was a key. [254]

A shadow fell across him. [258]
"Found something interesting?" a voice asked, smooth as honey but edged with steel. [274]
Elias looked up to see Maren, the tower’s chief engineer, her goggles pushed back to reveal eyes sharp enough to dissect a man’s thoughts. [299]
She was the one who’d designed the drone beehives, the ones that pollinated the floating gardens when the real bees had vanished. [326]
"Just a box," he said, but the words tasted like ash. [339]
Maren’s gaze dropped to the lacquer box, then to the matchbox in his hand. [352]
"You’re holding it wrong," she said, and plucked the matchbox from his fingers before he could protest. [372]

She struck a match. [375]
The flame flared blue, not orange, and the air smelled suddenly of ozone and burnt sugar. [391]
Elias’s skin prickled. [394]
Maren held the match to the riddle, and the paper curled in on itself, the ink rearranging into a new message: *"The hive is dying. The tower knows."* [426]
Elias’s stomach twisted. [431]
The drone beehives weren’t just failing—they were being sabotaged. [441]
And the lightning tower, the city’s last great wonder, was the only thing that could fix them. [457]

Maren’s expression darkened. [460]
"The blackout wasn’t an accident," she said. [467]
"The tower’s core was drained. Someone’s been siphoning its charge to keep the hives alive, but it’s not enough." [493]
Elias thought of the floating gardens, their blossoms wilting without the drones, the way the city’s children had stopped believing in magic when the bees stopped humming. [529]
He thought of his own motivation: to preserve wonder in routine, even if it meant standing in the rain counting coins for the rest of his life. [561]

Maren pocketed the matchbox. [566]
"We need to get inside the tower," she said. [575]
Elias hesitated. [577]
The tower was off-limits, a relic of a time when people still reached for the sky. [594]
But the riddle had chosen him, hadn’t it? [601]
And if the hives failed, the city would forget how to dream. [614]

They slipped past the rusted gate, the tower’s hum growing louder with each step. [631]
The air tasted of nectar dusk, that strange hour when the light was neither day nor night but something sweeter, something fleeting. [660]
At the tower’s heart, they found the core—a sphere of crackling energy, its glow dimmed to a sickly pulse. [685]
Maren pressed the matchbox to its surface, and the riddle flared again: *"Strike the spark that remembers."* [707]

Elias understood. [710]
The tower didn’t just collect lightning—it remembered it. [722]
And the hives needed that memory, that wild, untamed charge, to survive. [740]
He struck a match. [744]
The flame burned blue once more, and this time, the tower answered. [759]
Lightning arced from the core, not up, but out—into the sky, where the drone beehives hovered like dying stars. [787]
One by one, they flickered back to life, their wings humming with stolen thunder. [805]

Maren exhaled, her breath shaky. [810]
"Someone didn’t want us to fix this," she murmured. [821]
Elias nodded, watching the hives rise into the twilight. [830]
