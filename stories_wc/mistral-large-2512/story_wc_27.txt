The abandoned spaceport repair bay groaned under the weight of forgotten time, its rusted girders whispering secrets to the wind. [18]
Lira crouched barefoot on the cracked concrete, her toes curling against the cold, her eyes fixed on the fractured skylight above. [44]
She had come here for the silence, for the way the dying light pooled in the corners like spilled mercury, but the hum of the ancient stone circle beyond the bay’s broken walls had drawn her deeper. [90]
It was a sound she couldn’t ignore—not a song, not a voice, but a vibration that thrummed in her bones, as if the earth itself were breathing. [129]

She adjusted the vintage opera glasses hanging from her neck, their brass frames warm against her skin. [154]
They had belonged to her grandmother, a woman who had spent her life charting the stars before the rebellion swallowed the sky. [185]
Lira had found them in a dust-choked drawer, their lenses still smudged with the old woman’s fingerprints, as if she had known Lira would need them one day. [221]
Now, she lifted them to her eyes, scanning the horizon where the stone circle stood half-buried in the overgrown field. [251]
The glasses brought the distant monoliths into sharp relief, their surfaces etched with symbols that seemed to shift when she blinked. [282]

The rebellion had ended in a whimper, not a bang. [292]
The fighters had laid down their weapons not out of surrender, but exhaustion, their dreams of freedom curdling into something bitter and small. [324]
Lira had been a child then, too young to understand why the adults around her had stopped shouting and started whispering. [354]
Now, she wondered if they had ever known what they were fighting for—or if they had just been afraid of the quiet. [382]

She was awkwardly confident in her solitude, a trait that had always set her apart. [403]
Others called her reckless for wandering the ruins alone, but Lira didn’t see it that way. [429]
The world was a mess of broken things, and she was determined to find meaning in the shards. [454]
That was why she had come here, to this place where the past and future bled together in the margin of daylight. [485]

The hum of the stone circle grew louder, a low, resonant pulse that made her teeth ache. [511]
She stood, brushing dust from her knees, and stepped toward the bay’s shattered exit. [535]
The air outside was thick with the scent of ozone and wildflowers, the kind of smell that made her think of storms and stillness at the same time. [570]
Thunderous serenity—that was the only way to describe it. [583]

As she approached the circle, the stones seemed to lean toward her, their shadows stretching long and hungry across the grass. [618]
She reached out, her fingers hovering just above the nearest monolith, and the hum surged, vibrating through her palm like a heartbeat. [653]
A memory flickered at the edges of her mind: her grandmother’s voice, soft but insistent, telling her about the old ways, about how the stones had once been used to call down the stars. [699]

Lira’s breath hitched. [703]
The rebellion had failed because it had forgotten its own magic. [721]
The fighters had been so busy tearing things apart that they had never stopped to listen to the earth beneath their feet. [755]
But the stones were still here, waiting. [766]

She closed her eyes and pressed her palm flat against the cold surface. [785]
The hum became a roar, a sound so vast it swallowed the world. [806]
And then, for the first time in years, she felt something like hope. [827]
Not the desperate, grasping kind, but the quiet certainty that the fire wasn’t gone—it just needed someone to reignite it. [862]
