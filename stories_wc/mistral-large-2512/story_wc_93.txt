The aurora shimmered like a half-remembered dream over the tidal bluff, its ribbons of green and violet weaving through the salt-stiff air. [18]
Elias had spent thirty-seven years herding eels through these shallows, their slippery bodies darting between his fingers like living shadows. [43]
No one else could see them—not truly—only the ripples they left behind, the way the water dimpled as if kissed by something unseen. [76]
That was the curse of the precognitively cursed: to know the shape of things before they happened, but never the why. [102]

Tonight, the friction between the world and his skin had vanished. [115]
No wind tugged at his cloak, no sand clung to his boots, no eels brushed against his ankles as they usually did. [140]
It was as if the air itself had decided to forget him. [152]
Elias knelt, pressing his palm to the damp earth, and felt the hum of something older than the bluff, older than the sea. [178]
The sacred patterns, his grandmother had called them—the invisible threads that held the world together. [199]
He had spent his life trying to understand them, to trace their logic in the way eels moved, in the way the tides obeyed the moon’s pull. [231]

But now, the patterns were unraveling. [238]
He reached into his satchel and withdrew the jar of collapsed star dust, its contents glowing faintly, like embers in a dying fire. [264]
His father had given it to him on his deathbed, whispering, *"Harness it, or the promise dies with me."* [286]
Elias had never known what the promise was, only that it lingered, a weight in his chest, a debt unpaid. [310]

The star dust was the key. [315]
He uncorked the jar and let a pinch of it spill onto his palm, watching as it swirled into the air, drawn toward the aurora like iron to a lodestone. [345]
It was then he noticed the painted rocks—smooth, palm-sized, their surfaces marked with spirals and angles in ochre and bone-white. [369]
They had always been there, half-buried in the sand, but tonight, their arrangement made sense. [388]
A sequence, his grandmother’s voice murmured in his mind. *Place them right, and the world bends.* [411]

Elias set to work, his fingers moving with the precision of a man who had spent a lifetime reading the unseen. [442]
He laid the first rock where the tide’s edge met the bluff, the second where the aurora’s light pooled brightest, the third where the eels had once gathered. [475]
The star dust followed, tracing the lines between them, forming a constellation on the ground. [495]
The air thrummed, low and deep, like the moment before a storm breaks. [514]

Then, the eels returned. [520]
Not as ripples, not as shadows, but as solid, silver bodies, coiling around his wrists, their gills flaring in the cold. [548]
They carried something in their mouths—a shard of something, dark and jagged, humming with the same energy as the star dust. [574]
Elias took it, and the moment his fingers closed around it, the promise became clear. [596]
His father had known the patterns were breaking, had known the friction would one day disappear. [621]
The star dust was a remnant of the first collapse, the moment the world had nearly unraveled. [643]
The eels were its keepers, its silent guardians, and the painted rocks were the map to mend what had been torn. [670]

He placed the final rock, completing the sequence. [681]
The aurora flared, the star dust ignited, and for a single, breathless moment, the world held still. [705]
Then, the friction returned—not as it had been, but as it was meant to be. [725]
The wind tugged at his cloak, the sand clung to his boots, and the eels, satisfied, slipped back into the depths. [750]
Elias exhaled, the weight in his chest lighter now, the promise kept. [765]
The patterns were whole again, at least for a little while. [778]
