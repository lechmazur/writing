The mountain weather station clung to the ridge like a half-remembered dream, its metal bones groaning under the weight of the wind. [18]
Inside, Elias traced the edges of the botanical illustration with a finger that trembled—not from cold, but from the residue of fever still clinging to his bones. [49]
The drawing depicted a flower that didn’t exist, at least not in any field guide he’d ever seen: petals like shattered glass, roots coiled in impossible spirals. [80]
It had been slipped under his door the night his fever broke, though no one else was supposed to be up here. [103]

Elias was a fault-tolerant oracle, which meant he saw the future in fragments, each one slightly wrong, like a reflection in rippling water. [133]
Most people found that frustrating. [136]
He found it freeing. [139]
If the future was never certain, then neither were the mistakes he made in predicting it. [158]
But the illustration unsettled him. [163]
It wasn’t a vision—it was too precise, too deliberate. [175]
Someone had left it for him, and that someone was peripherally aware, always just out of sight, like the edge of a shadow you can’t quite turn to face. [208]

He smudged the ink with his thumb, as if erasing it might erase the question it raised: *Why this flower?* [230]
The station’s logs showed no visitors in weeks, yet the illustration had appeared the moment his fever lifted, as if it had been waiting for him to wake. [260]
Elias had spent years occupying margins—between sleep and waking, between truth and prophecy, between the world and whatever lay beyond it. [288]
Now, he realized, someone else was doing the same. [300]

The wind howled outside, carrying the auroral sorrow of dawn, that fragile moment when the sky bleeds light but the earth remains dark. [330]
Elias stepped onto the observation deck, the cold biting through his layers. [345]
Below, the valley stretched like a bruise, the trees swaying in the grip of a certainty that wasn’t theirs to hold. [370]
He had come here to find the weight of a swallowed truth—his own. [385]
Years ago, he’d predicted a landslide that never came, and in the aftermath, a village had been abandoned for nothing. [413]
The guilt had festered, silent and heavy, like a stone in his chest. [433]

The illustration was a clue, he decided. [442]
Not of the future, but of the present—someone was trying to tell him something. [462]
He returned to the station, flipping through the botanical encyclopedias until he found a match: *Lysimachia umbratica*, the shadow’s whisper. [491]
A flower said to grow only where the earth had been disturbed, where something had been buried. [514]

Elias grabbed his pack and descended the mountain, following the wind’s memory. [530]
The trees thinned, revealing a clearing where the ground was uneven, as if something had been dug up and reburied in haste. [558]
He knelt, brushing away the dirt, and found a rusted tin box. [573]
Inside was a single photograph: a child standing in front of the village he’d doomed, her face blurred by time. [598]
A note on the back read, *You were wrong, but so were we.* [614]

The weight of the truth settled over him, not crushing, but grounding. [629]
He had spent years fearing his mistakes, but the world had moved on, had found its own way to sway despite them. [656]
The oracle’s burden wasn’t to be right—it was to be present. [672]
As he climbed back to the station, the first true light of dawn touched the peaks, and for the first time in years, Elias breathed without the weight of prophecy pressing down. [711]
The illustration fluttered in his pocket, no longer a mystery, but a reminder: some truths were meant to be unearthed, not foretold. [740]
