The blooming library above the clouds had always been Elias’s sanctuary, its shelves woven from silver vines that unfurled petals at dusk. [20]
He was a sharp-eyed dusk noticer, the kind of man who saw the exact moment the sky bruised from blue to violet, who traced the first flicker of fireflies before they dared to glow. [53]
Tonight, the library hummed with the quiet rustle of pages turning themselves, as if the books remembered his presence. [76]
Elias placed the river stone on the windowsill, its surface worn smooth by centuries of water and time, its weight a comfort against his palm. [104]
It was the last remnant of the river that had once flowed through the valley below, before the earth had cracked open and swallowed it whole. [130]

A shadow unbound slithered across the floor, not cast by any lamp or moon, but by something older. [151]
Elias had spent years studying it—how it stretched when no one was looking, how it pooled in corners like spilled ink. [175]
He was softly deliberate in his movements, never rushing, never panicking, as if the shadow were a skittish animal he might startle away. [201]
His fingers hovered over the archive terminal, where silent video footage from decades apart flickered side by side. [225]
One reel showed the valley in full bloom, children laughing as they skipped stones across the river’s surface. [244]
The other was the same place, now a scarred wasteland, the river reduced to a trickle of dust. [264]

Elias had come to the library after dreams became shareable, when the world realized that what one person imagined in sleep could be recorded and replayed. [294]
He had watched his own dreams first—fragments of the river, the way it had sounded like laughter when the current caught the light. [322]
Then he had sought others’, stitching together their memories like a quilt, desperate to preserve the shape of hope before it unraveled entirely. [353]
The shadow unbound shifted behind him, its edges fraying as if it, too, was trying to remember something. [376]

He had a theory: that shadows were not just absences of light, but echoes of what had been. [399]
The river’s shadow, he believed, was still out there, clinging to the earth like a ghost. [421]
If he could prove it, if he could make the world see, then maybe the valley could metamorphose back into what it had been. [450]
The stone in his hand grew warm, as if it agreed. [463]

The library’s vines trembled, their petals glowing faintly in the dim light. [480]
Elias leaned closer to the screen, comparing the footage frame by frame. [495]
In the old video, a woman knelt by the riverbank, her hands cupped around something small. [517]
In the new one, the same spot was barren, but if he squinted, he could almost see her shadow still bent in prayer. [544]
The shadow unbound coiled around his ankle, cold as the river’s memory. [562]

He had spent his life chasing this moment, this sliver of proof that the past wasn’t gone, only waiting. [588]
The stone pulsed once, twice, then rolled from his palm onto the floor. [607]
Elias didn’t pick it up. [612]
Instead, he reached for the terminal’s controls, his movements softly deliberate, as if afraid to break the spell. [640]
The footage merged, the old and the new overlapping until the river flowed again, if only on the screen. [666]
The shadow unbound stilled, its edges sharpening into something almost solid. [687]

For the first time in years, Elias smiled. [698]
The library sighed around him, its petals unfolding wider, as if it, too, had been holding its breath. [725]
He knew the valley wouldn’t return overnight—nothing worth preserving ever did. [744]
But hope, he realized, was not a thing to be frozen in time. [760]
It was a river, always moving, always changing, and if you were patient, you could still hear it in the silence. [786]
The shadow unbound dissolved into the dark, its work done for now. [803]
Elias closed his eyes, listening. [810]
