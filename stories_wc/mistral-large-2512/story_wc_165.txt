The tidal arcade stretched like a ribcage of salt-bleached wood beneath a sky smeared with stars, their light pooling in the shallow water that lapped at the pillars. [23]
Lira crouched on the damp planks, her fingers tracing the grooves of a bishop’s chess piece she had found wedged between two boards, its ivory surface worn smooth by time and tide. [55]
She wasn’t supposed to be here—not between acts, when the performers of the night market packed up their stalls and the arcade became a liminal space, neither open nor closed. [89]
But Lira preferred it this way: the quiet, the way the water murmured against the wood, the way the stars seemed to hold their breath. [118]

She was an analytical street performer, though no one would have guessed it from her act. [135]
To the crowd, she was just another fire-eater, a girl who swallowed flames and spat them back like a challenge. [157]
But Lira saw patterns in everything—the way a breeze shifted the embers, the way a child’s laughter made the fire dance higher, the way the bishop’s chess piece had appeared exactly when she needed it. [191]
Orchestrated serendipity, she called it: the art of making luck look accidental. [209]

Tonight, she was tired of monotony. [215]
The same tricks, the same faces, the same applause that rang hollow after the hundredth performance. [234]
She wanted to serenade the dullness with something new, something that would make even the stars lean in. [254]
So she turned the bishop over in her palm, its weight familiar now, and smiled. [270]

The arcade was lightly attentive, as if the wood and water were listening. [283]
She had noticed it before—the way the tide receded just enough for her to set up her act, the way the wind carried her voice to the right people. [315]
Tonight, she would happen upon her next move. [327]
Not by chance, but by ordering randomness. [338]

She stood, the bishop clutched in her fist, and walked to the center of the arcade where the water was deepest. [360]
The stars reflected in the black mirror below, doubling the sky. [373]
Lira took a breath, then tossed the bishop into the water. [385]
It sank without a sound, but she didn’t watch it go. [396]
Instead, she turned to the empty stalls, the abandoned props, the echoes of the night market still lingering in the air. [425]

She began to move. [430]
Not in the practiced, precise way of her fire act, but in something looser, wilder—a dance that felt like it was being invented as she went. [460]
Her feet splashed through the shallow water, sending ripples across the stars. [476]
She grabbed a forgotten lantern from a stall, its glass cracked but still glowing, and swung it in wide arcs. [503]
The light painted streaks of gold across the wood, the water, her own skin. [523]

A figure emerged from the shadows—a man with a violin, his instrument tucked under his arm like a secret. [547]
Lira had seen him before, playing for coins near the bakery. [559]
He was lightly attentive too, she realized, his eyes flicking toward her before settling back on the ground. [583]
She held out the lantern, an invitation. [592]

The man hesitated, then lifted his bow. [599]
A single note trembled in the air, rich and uncertain. [611]
Lira matched it with her own voice, a low hum that vibrated in her chest. [628]
The note stretched, bent, became something new. [638]

The arcade seemed to exhale. [644]
The water stilled, the stars brightened, and for a moment, everything was exactly as it should be. [667]
Lira laughed, the sound sharp and bright, and the man grinned, his fingers moving faster across the strings. [692]
The music spiraled upward, wild and calculated all at once, a serenade to the monotony they had both been fighting. [723]

The bishop’s chess piece was gone, swallowed by the tide. [735]
But Lira didn’t need it anymore. [743]
She had orchestrated serendipity, and it had happened—not by chance, but because she had ordered the randomness of the night into something beautiful. [776]
The arcade was alive again, humming with the echoes of their performance, and Lira knew this was only the beginning. [805]
She would come back tomorrow, between acts, and see what else the tide might bring. [827]
