The cathedral’s vaulted ceiling had long since surrendered to the orchard’s advance, its skeletal rafters now heavy with peach blossoms and the weight of time. [22]
Liora, the quartz-eye mender, adjusted the frayed strap of her satchel as she stepped over a moss-covered pew, her boots sinking slightly into the damp earth beneath. [53]
She had come here after the breach of contract, though no one had called it that—just another broken promise between the old world and the new. [88]
Her daughter’s hair ribbon, a strip of faded crimson silk, was tied around her wrist like a reminder, its edges frayed from years of anxious twisting. [125]

The orchard was alive with the hum of bees, their wings dusted with pollen as they darted between the branches that crisscrossed the nave. [152]
Liora had heard the stories—that the trees had been planted by the last of the cathedral’s caretakers, who swore they would bear fruit until the world forgot hunger. [188]
But the world had forgotten plenty, and the vows of those caretakers had turned deciduous, shedding their meaning with the seasons. [215]
She wasn’t here to judge them. [221]
She was here to persist. [225]

Her fingers brushed the contents of her bag, pulling out a chipped mortar and pestle, a bundle of dried lavender, and a small, cloth-wrapped parcel that smelled faintly of iron. [259]
Forgotten bag contents, she thought, though she knew better. [268]
Nothing was ever truly forgotten—just misplaced, like the wisdom of the old ones, buried under layers of doubt. [294]

A rustle in the branches made her look up. [303]
A girl, no older than twelve, perched on a low-hanging bough, her knees drawn to her chest. [325]
She was endearingly feisty, her dark eyes sharp with curiosity as she watched Liora with the intensity of someone who had already decided she knew better. [361]
“You’re the mender,” the girl said, not a question. [371]
Liora nodded. [373]
“My grandmother said you could fix anything with a crack.” [387]

Liora’s chest tightened. [391]
She had come to bridge generational wisdom, though she hadn’t known it until that moment. [413]
The girl hopped down, landing with a soft thud, and held out a quartz pendant, its surface marred by a hairline fracture. [443]
“It was my mother’s,” she said. [451]
“She said it would keep me safe, but it broke when she—” [466]
The girl’s voice faltered, and Liora knew the rest. [477]

She took the pendant, turning it in the dappled light. [489]
The fracture wasn’t deep, but it was old, like a wound that had never quite healed. [512]
Liora reached for the parcel in her bag, unwrapping it to reveal a sliver of silver wire and a vial of resin. [538]
“Some things can’t be fixed all at once,” she said, her voice steady. [556]
“But if you persist, the cracks can hold something new.” [572]

The girl watched as Liora worked, her small hands clutching the ribbon at her own wrist—a match to the one Liora wore. [600]
“Why do you still have hers?” the girl asked suddenly. [614]
Liora didn’t look up. [619]
“Because some promises don’t break, even when they’re supposed to.” [641]
The girl was silent for a long moment. [652]
Then, softly: “My grandmother said the trees here remember everything.” [675]

Liora smiled. [678]
“Maybe they do,” she said. [684]
“But it’s not the remembering that matters—it’s what you do with it.” [710]
She tied off the last of the wire, the pendant now whole, if not unscarred. [730]
The girl took it back, her fingers tracing the repaired fracture. [745]
“Will it still keep me safe?” [754]

Liora hesitated. [757]
“It’ll remind you that you already are.” [770]
The girl tucked the pendant into her pocket, then reached into her own bag and pulled out a peach, its skin blushing pink. [799]
“For you,” she said. [803]
Liora took it, the fruit warm from the sun. [814]
As she bit into it, the juice sweet on her tongue, she thought of the orchard, of the vows that had outlasted their makers, and of the quiet wisdom in knowing when to let things grow. [862]
