The harbor glazier, Elias Vey, stood at the edge of the docks in Pearl Bay, his breath curling in the cold dawn air like the mist that clung to the water. [23]
He had spent thirty years fitting glass into ships’ lanterns, each pane a tiny prison for the light that guided sailors home, yet he had never once considered the nature of the light itself. [60]
Today, though, the prism atrium at the heart of the bay caught his eye—a structure he had passed a hundred times without truly seeing. [89]
It rose from the water like a skeletal cathedral, its panes fractured into a thousand angles, each one catching the first pale rays of the sun and scattering them into spectral shards. [132]
Elias had heard the old sailors whisper about it, how the atrium was a place where the sky and sea traded secrets, but he had always dismissed such talk as superstition. [168]
Now, as the mist swirled around its base, he wondered if the stories held more truth than he’d allowed himself to believe. [196]

He had come to the bay this morning not for work, but because of the dream that had woken him—a dream of rings spreading across still water, each one a question without an answer. [235]
The noctilucent reckonings, as the fishermen called them, were said to appear only when the world was on the cusp of change, when the boundary between what was and what could be grew thin. [276]
Elias had never put much stock in omens, but the dream had left him restless, as if the water itself had been trying to tell him something. [311]
He knelt at the dock’s edge, plucking a smooth stone from the shore, and let it fall into the pond-like stillness of the bay’s shallows. [341]
The ripples spread outward, concentric and perfect, and for a moment, Elias thought he saw words forming in their wake—phrases just beyond comprehension, like a language half-remembered. [381]

He had always been one to read between the lines, whether in the grain of wood beneath his fingertips or the way a customer’s voice tightened when they spoke of the sea. [418]
But this was different. This was the world speaking in patterns, in the silent geometry of water and light. [444]
The prism atrium loomed closer now, its glass panes humming with the dawn’s first full light, and Elias felt the pull of it, like a moth to a flame he couldn’t name. [481]
He stepped onto the narrow walkway that led to its entrance, the wood groaning beneath his weight, and pushed open the door. [511]
Inside, the air was thick with the scent of salt and old paper, and the walls were lined with ledgers—hundreds of them, their spines cracked with age. [547]
Elias ran his fingers along the nearest one, tracing the faded ink of a sailor’s log, and felt the weight of all the stories trapped within. [579]

A voice behind him made him turn. [585]
“You’re the glazier, aren’t you?” [592]
An old woman stood in the doorway, her face lined with years of watching the tide. [612]
She carried a lantern, its light casting long shadows across the floor, and in her other hand, she held a stone much like the one Elias had dropped into the water. [650]
“They say you see things others don’t,” she said. [666]
Elias hesitated, then nodded. [671]
“Then you’re the one who can help,” she continued, stepping forward. [689]
“There’s a reckoning coming, and the atrium is the only place where the truth can be read.” [718]

She placed the stone in his palm, her fingers cold against his skin. [736]
“Throw it into the center of the room,” she instructed. [749]
“And watch.” [752]
Elias did as she asked, the stone clattering against the glass floor before sinking into a shallow pool of water at the atrium’s heart. [785]
The ripples spread, and this time, the patterns were unmistakable—shapes of ships and storms, of faces he recognized and others he didn’t, all woven into the water’s surface. [830]
The old woman leaned in, her breath warm against his ear. [845]
“Before everything shifts,” she whispered, “we must find the value in the mundane.” [868]
Elias understood then, not just the atrium’s purpose, but his own. [884]
The light had always been there, waiting to be seen. [897]
