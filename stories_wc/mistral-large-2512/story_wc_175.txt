The grotto hummed with the quiet weight of forgotten things, its moss-draped walls breathing in the mist that curled above the clouds like smoke from a doused fire. [23]
Liora crouched among the ferns, her fingers tracing the vein of a moth wing pressed between the pages of her notebook—delicate, iridescent, a relic of some night she had not lived. [57]
She was an esoteric realist, which meant she believed in the tangible weight of what others dismissed as ephemera: the way a shadow lingered after the object casting it was gone, how a name whispered in an empty room could still vibrate the air. [105]
Here, in this verdant grotto suspended between earth and sky, she had come to honor the overlooked histories of the monarchs, whose migration was the last of its kind, a cadence interrupted by winds that no longer carried them as they once had. [155]

The first signal was a tower of stacked stones, each one chosen for the way it caught the light just before dusk. [180]
Liora built it with the precision of a woman who knew her time was transiently rooted—planted deep enough to matter, but not so deep it couldn’t be uprooted when the moment passed. [219]
She knotted a length of twine around the base, not to bind the stones together, but to mark the place where the monarchs had paused in years past, their wings a blur of orange against the green. [265]
The knot was loose, deliberate; it would unravel when the wind demanded it, just as the butterflies had unraveled from their ancient path. [295]

She had learned the method from an old woman in Oaxaca, who had shown her how to build temporary structures as signals—altars that crumbled, bridges that dissolved, all of them speaking in a language of impermanence. [343]
“They are not for holding,” the woman had said, “but for remembering.” [360]
Liora had taken the lesson into her bones, though she had never stayed in one place long enough to call it home. [385]
The grotto was different; it pulled at her, as if the very air was thick with the ghosts of migrations that had faltered mid-flight. [419]

By the third day, the monarchs began to arrive. [432]
They came in ones and twos at first, then in a slow, drifting cloud, their wings beating with the rhythm of a song that had been sung for centuries but was now missing its final verses. [478]
Liora watched from the edge of the grotto, her breath shallow, her cheeks warm with the blushing stillness of the moment. [507]
She had not expected them to come here, not after the storms had scattered their path, not after the forests had thinned to memory. [540]
But they had, and in their arrival, she saw the proof of what she had always suspected: that the world was full of things that persisted, even when no one was looking. [585]

She built another signal—a lattice of reeds strung between two saplings, hung with moth wings and the husks of cicadas. [615]
The monarchs alighted on it, their tiny feet testing the fragile structure before they took flight again, as if they, too, were leaving a message. [650]
Liora knelt in the damp earth, her notebook open, her pen hovering over the page. [670]
She wrote: *They are not lost. They are waiting for the wind to remember its old songs.* [698]

The grotto held its breath. [703]
The mist curled tighter, the moss drank the light, and for a moment, it was as if the world had paused to listen. [734]
Then the monarchs lifted, their wings catching the last of the sun, and Liora knew they would not return. [764]
Not this year, perhaps not ever. [772]
But that was the nature of things that were transiently rooted: they bloomed, they faded, they left behind something that could not be named but could be felt. [815]

She packed her notebook, her fingers brushing the moth wing one last time. [835]
The grotto would forget her, as it forgot all who passed through, but that was alright. [857]
She had come to honor what was overlooked, and in doing so, she had glimpsed the shape of something vast and quiet, like the space between the beats of a heart. [897]
The stones would fall, the reeds would rot, but the signal had been sent. [917]
And that was enough. [922]
