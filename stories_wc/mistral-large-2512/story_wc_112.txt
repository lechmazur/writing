The xenobiology research station hummed with the quiet efficiency of machines at rest, its corridors lined with the faint glow of bioluminescent algae that pulsed like slow, sleeping breaths. [23]
Dr. Elara Vey, the station’s obliging sky mechanic, adjusted the last thermal regulator on her wrist-mounted interface, her fingers moving with practiced precision. [50]
She had spent years tending to the station’s atmospheric systems, ensuring the delicate balance of gases that kept both human and alien life thriving in this floating lab above the gas giant’s upper clouds. [91]
But tonight, her work was different. [96]
Tonight, she was chasing a theory—one that had gnawed at her since she first noticed the anomalies in the station’s temporal logs. [125]

The magnetic nexus at twilight was the key. [133]
It appeared only when the gas giant’s electromagnetic field aligned with the station’s own, a fleeting window where the laws of physics seemed to soften at the edges. [166]
Elara had seen it before, a shimmering distortion in the air, like heat haze given form, but she had never dared to interact with it. [193]
Not until now. [196]

Her motivation was simple: to prove that time moves sideways. [210]
Not forward, not backward, but laterally—slipping between moments like pages in a book, unseen but present. [232]
The station’s xenobiologists dismissed her as a mechanic with delusions of grandeur, but Elara knew the truth was buried in the data. [256]
The creatures they studied, the winged xenos with iridescent plumage, moved through time in ways that defied linear logic. [279]
Their wings, when at rest, emitted a low-frequency hum that resonated with the station’s structure, creating a hush so profound it felt like the universe itself was holding its breath. [318]

She reached the observation deck, where the nexus was strongest. [329]
The air here was mechanically warm, a paradoxical blend of cold metal and the faint, living heat of the station’s organic components. [356]
Elara’s breath fogged the glass as she pressed her palm against the control panel, initiating the holographic interface. [379]
The projection flickered to life, casting shifting patterns of light that danced across the nexus like ripples on water. [406]

Through holographic principles, she could manipulate the nexus without touching it directly. [425]
The station’s AI had warned her against this, but Elara had overridden the safety protocols. [443]
She adjusted the frequency of the projection, syncing it with the winged xenos’ resting hum. [461]
The nexus pulsed in response, its edges blurring as if dissolving into the air. [477]

Then she saw it—a lever, suspended in the distortion, its surface etched with symbols that matched the patterns on the xenos’ wings. [508]
It wasn’t physical, not really. [513]
It was a construct of time itself, a bridge between moments. [528]
Elara’s heart pounded as she reached out, her fingers passing through the hologram until they brushed the lever’s edge. [553]

A subdued awakening. [556]
The station shuddered, not with violence, but with the quiet unfolding of something vast and unseen. [582]
The winged xenos in their containment chambers stirred, their wings twitching in unison, as if responding to a call only they could hear. [614]
Elara’s vision blurred, and for a moment, she saw the station not as it was, but as it had been—years ago, when the first xenos were captured. [651]
Then, just as suddenly, she saw it as it would be: abandoned, its corridors overgrown with bioluminescent vines, the xenos long gone. [687]

Time had moved sideways. [692]
She had proven it. [695]

But the nexus was collapsing, its energy draining into the station’s systems. [713]
Alarms blared, their shrill tones cutting through the hush of beating wings. [730]
Elara stumbled back, her hands trembling as she tried to stabilize the holographic projection. [750]
The lever vanished, and with it, the sideways moments she had glimpsed. [767]

The station’s AI demanded an explanation, but Elara could only laugh, a sound that was half wonder, half despair. [791]
She had seen the truth, but now she had to live with the weight of it. [810]
The xenos weren’t just creatures—they were timekeepers, their wings the pendulums of a clock no human had ever understood. [839]

And she, the obliging sky mechanic, had just pulled the lever that set it all in motion. [860]
