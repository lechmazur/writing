The lantern lighter’s hands trembled as he struck the match, its flare cutting through the gleaming silence of the docks. [16]
Salt hung thick in the air, not from the sea but from the crystal chambers humming beneath the wharf, their glass walls fogged with condensation. [40]
Marlowe had lit these same lanterns for twenty years, yet tonight, the weight of the flame felt different—heavier, as if the pockets of gravity beneath the town had shifted while he wasn’t looking. [81]

He tucked the pressed wildflowers into his coat pocket, their brittle edges crumbling against his callouses. [99]
They were all that remained of his sister’s last letter, sent the week before the whale beached itself on the northern shoals. [125]
No one spoke of her after that, not even the fishermen who’d helped haul the carcass away. [143]
Marlowe had tried to forget too, but the memories kept slipping through his fingers like the grains of salt that dusted his boots. [168]

The coffee grounds in his tin cup had long gone cold, but he swirled them anyway, tracing the patterns with a finger. [189]
His mother had taught him this trick—how to read the dregs for answers when the world grew too loud. [210]
Tonight, the grounds formed a spiral, tight at the edges and loose at the center, a shape that made his stomach clench. [234]
It was the same pattern he’d seen the night his sister vanished, the night the whale’s song had vibrated through the salt chambers and left cracks in the walls. [264]

Marlowe exhaled, his breath fogging the lantern glass. [274]
He knew where he had to go. [281]

The salt crystal growing chamber was deserted at this hour, its usual hum of machinery replaced by a low, resonant thrum. [308]
The air tasted of ozone and something older, like the inside of a conch shell pressed to the ear. [330]
Marlowe knelt beside the largest vat, where the crystals grew in jagged, translucent towers. [349]
His sister’s journal lay buried beneath the sediment, its leather cover warped by brine. [364]
He’d hidden it there the day after the whale beached, when the town’s archivist had come to collect her things. [391]

Exhuming it now felt like digging up a grave. [402]
The journal’s pages stuck together, but when he pried them apart, the words were still legible. [421]
*"The whale isn’t dead,"* she’d written. *"It’s holding something. Something that pulls at the edges of things."* [443]
Marlowe’s pulse quickened. [446]

He turned the page and found a sketch—a spiral, identical to the one in his coffee grounds. [465]
Beneath it, a single sentence: *"They’re not memories. They’re echoes. And they’re still down there."* [486]

The lantern’s light flickered as the chamber’s gravity fluctuated, the crystals trembling in their vats. [506]
Marlowe’s boots slid an inch toward the center of the room, drawn by an invisible current. [526]
He clutched the journal tighter. [533]

The whale’s carcass had been towed to the deep-water trench, but Marlowe knew the truth now. [552]
It hadn’t been a carcass at all. [560]
It had been a vessel, and whatever it carried was still calling to the town, bending the salt and the light and the air itself. [590]

He stood, the pressed wildflowers falling from his pocket like scattered stars. [606]
The coffee grounds had shown him the way, but the journal had given him the reason. [626]
If deleted memories weren’t gone—if they were just echoes waiting to be found—then maybe his sister wasn’t gone either. [654]

Marlowe adjusted his lantern and stepped forward, the pockets of gravity pulling him toward the chamber’s heart. [679]
The crystals gleamed in the dark, refracting the light into a thousand silent, searching beams. [701]
Somewhere beneath the salt and the sea, the whale was still singing. [717]
And for the first time in years, Marlowe answered. [729]
[730]
