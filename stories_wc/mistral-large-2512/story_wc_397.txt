The first time Elias woke with the weight of endings pressing on his ribs, the drift-ice marina was already humming with the low, mournful creak of thawing floes. [23]
He had come here as a euthanasia tourist, one of those who paid to witness the last breaths of strangers in countries where death was legal, gentle, and sold as a service. [59]
But something had shifted in him overnight—his skin felt thinner, his thoughts slower, as if time itself had folded into a pocket of patience he could carry like a coin. [97]

Elias gripped reality loosely now, as if the world might slip through his fingers if he held too tight. [123]
The heirloom lace parasol tip in his pocket—a fragment of his grandmother’s, broken off during a storm decades ago—was the only solid thing he allowed himself to cling to. [159]
He ran his thumb over its delicate edges, the ivory bone warm from his body heat, and wondered if it had been waiting for this moment all along. [192]

The marina was a skeletal thing, built on stilts above the shifting ice, its wooden planks groaning under the weight of volunteers and the occasional mourner. [226]
Elias had signed up to trawl through the aftermath of a recent ice-shelf collapse, not out of altruism, but because he needed to hear the sound of endings approaching. [264]
The disaster relief teams moved like ghosts, their voices muffled by the wind, their hands numb from sorting through the wreckage of homes that had floated away. [298]

A woman with frostbitten fingers pressed a chipped mug of tea into his palms. [315]
“You’re new,” she said, her breath curling in the air. [327]
Elias nodded, watching the steam rise like a question. [339]
She studied him, then pointed to a cluster of tents where the worst cases were being treated. [354]
“If you want to hear it, go there,” she said. [367]
“The sound of endings isn’t in the ice. It’s in the lungs of the ones who know they’re next.” [394]

He walked toward the tents, the lace parasol tip digging into his palm. [412]
Inside, the air was thick with the scent of damp wool and antiseptic. [430]
A man lay on a cot, his chest rising and falling in shallow, uneven waves. [451]
Elias sat beside him, listening. [460]
The man’s breath was a wet rattle, a sound like pebbles dragged across a frozen shore. [486]
It was the most beautiful thing Elias had ever heard. [499]

“You’re one of them, aren’t you?” the man whispered. [514]
Elias didn’t ask what he meant. [523]
He already knew. [527]
The man’s fingers twitched, reaching for something. [540]
Elias placed the lace parasol tip in his hand. [552]
The man smiled, his lips cracking with the effort. [564]
“My mother had one of these,” he murmured. [576]
“She used to say it was for keeping the sun off, but really, it was for catching the wind.” [599]

Elias stayed until the man’s breathing stilled, until the sound of endings faded into the quiet. [626]
When he stepped outside, the marina was bathed in the pale light of a winter sun, the ice groaning beneath him like a living thing. [656]
He realized then that he had come here to learn the sound of his own ending, but what he had found instead was the sound of others’. [692]
And in that, there was a kind of windborne solace. [710]

The woman with frostbitten fingers found him later, sitting on the edge of the dock, the lace parasol tip now tucked into his coat lining. [742]
“You heard it, didn’t you?” she asked. [753]
Elias nodded. [756]
She didn’t press him for details. [764]
Instead, she handed him a clipboard with a list of names—people who had lost everything, people who were still waiting. [792]
“If you’re going to stay,” she said, “you might as well help.” [806]

Elias took the clipboard. [810]
The wind carried the scent of salt and thawing ice, and for the first time since waking up changed, he didn’t feel like a tourist anymore. [843]
