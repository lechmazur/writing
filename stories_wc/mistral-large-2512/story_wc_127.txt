The amber grotto hummed with the last golden breath of dusk, its walls pulsing like a living heart as the transformation completed. [18]
Liora Vey, counterfeit emotion dealer, adjusted the cuffs of her tailored coat, her fingers brushing the fragrance chemist’s blotter petal tucked into her breast pocket. [46]
It was no ordinary petal—its edges had been dipped in a solution that captured not just scent, but the ghost of feeling itself, the half-truths people told themselves to sleep at night. [83]
She had come here for a client, though "client" was too sterile a word for what they were to each other. [108]

Darian was already waiting, his silhouette sharp against the grotto’s honeyed glow, his breath steady despite the weight of what they were about to do. [140]
"You’re late," he murmured, though his tone held no rebuke—only the quiet understanding of someone who had spent a lifetime measuring time in heartbeats rather than seconds. [177]
Liora exhaled, the petal’s faint static clinging to her fingertips as she pulled it free. [195]
The charge was deliberate; the chemist had engineered it to react to the body’s natural electricity, to amplify what words couldn’t carry. [225]
She pressed it to Darian’s wrist, watching as the veins beneath his skin darkened momentarily, like ink bleeding through parchment. [251]

"What’s this one for?" he asked, though he already knew. [266]
"Grief," she said, because grief was the easiest half-truth to sell. [279]
People wanted to believe they were mourning one thing when they were really mourning another—the loss of a parent, perhaps, when the real wound was the child they’d never become. [316]
Darian’s jaw tightened, but he didn’t pull away. [328]
He never did. [331]

Liora had always been professionally thorough, a trait that had saved her more times than she could count. [354]
She traced the petal’s edge with her thumb, sensing the static’s pulse, the way it subsume the air between them, thick with unspoken things. [385]
It wasn’t just about the emotion she was selling; it was about the empathy she had to fake to make it convincing. [415]
That was the core of her work—to fuse insight with empathy, to make people believe the lie was the truth. [445]

Darian’s breath hitched as the petal’s charge settled into his skin, the amber light refracting through the grotto’s walls like a prism of memory. [476]
"You feel it?" she asked, though she didn’t need to. [488]
His nod was barely perceptible, but she saw the way his shoulders relaxed, the way his fingers uncurled from his palms. [517]
Grief was a heavy thing, but it was also a familiar thing, and familiarity was the most potent counterfeit of all. [546]

Liora stepped back, her own detachment a shield she wore like armor. [567]
It wasn’t that she didn’t care—she cared too much, which was why she had to keep her distance. [593]
Darian turned to her, his eyes reflecting the grotto’s glow, and for a moment, she let herself imagine what it would be like to believe in the emotions she sold. [635]
But that was a half-truth, too, and she had built her life on knowing the difference. [660]

The petal’s charge began to fade, its static dissipating into the grotto’s warm air. [682]
Darian flexed his wrist, as if testing the weight of what he’d just felt. [702]
"Same time next week?" he asked, and Liora nodded, because some lies were kinder than the truth. [730]

She watched him go, the grotto’s light swallowing his silhouette whole. [748]
The transformation was complete, but for whom, she wasn’t sure—him, or her. [767]
Liora tucked the spent petal back into her pocket, its edges now dull, its magic spent. [790]
She would need a new one soon, another half-truth to weave into the fabric of someone else’s life. [820]
But for now, she let the grotto’s amber glow warm her skin, just for a moment, before stepping back into the dark. [840]
