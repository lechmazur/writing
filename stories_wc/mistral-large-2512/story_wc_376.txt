The greenhouse city of Verdant Spire stretched beneath a sky the color of old bruises, its glass domes fogged with the residue of a thousand failed purifiers. [23]
Liora Vey, a gilded-leaf calligrapher, traced her fingers over the zinc-etched postal plate fragment she had found wedged between the floorboards of her studio. [52]
The metal was cold, its edges jagged where it had been torn from a larger sheet, but the faint imprint of a postmark remained—*Oasis-7, Year of the Last Rain*. [83]
She had no memory of receiving it, yet something about the fragment tugged at her, like a word on the tip of her tongue. [108]

Liora’s hands were steady as she dipped her brush into the inkwell, but her mind wandered. [126]
She had always been precise in her work, gilding leaves with delicate strokes that made them shimmer like captured sunlight, but lately, her art had begun to wilt near dishonesty. [158]
A client had asked her to forge a certificate of authenticity for a stolen heirloom, and though she had refused, the request had left her fingers trembling for days. [189]
Now, as she turned the postal plate over, she wondered if this fragment was a clue to something deeper. [212]

The city outside her window was a labyrinth of glass and steel, its streets lined with the skeletal remains of plants that had once thrived before the oasis dried. [245]
Liora had heard stories of the old world, of conversations that lingered in the air like perfume, of words that could be plucked from the ether if one knew where to look. [278]
She had never believed them—until now. [285]

She set the postal plate aside and knelt, prying up the loose floorboard beneath her workbench. [305]
There, beneath a layer of dust, was a pile of shredded paper—what remained of a treasure map, she realized, though she had no memory of tearing it apart. [338]
Her breath hitched. [341]
If she could piece it together, perhaps it would lead her to where lost conversations went. [360]

The first fragment was the easiest to place—a corner with a compass rose, its ink faded but still legible. [382]
The second showed a winding path through what looked like the ruins of the old botanical gardens. [407]
Liora worked methodically, her fingers smudging ink as she aligned each piece, her heart pounding with the certainty that this was no accident. [441]
Someone had hidden this map for a reason, and she was meant to find it. [460]

By the time the sky outside darkened to the color of dried blood, she had reconstructed half the map. [484]
The path led to a place called the Echo Vault, a chamber said to hold the remnants of every word ever spoken in Verdant Spire. [515]
Liora had heard whispers of it in the market, but she had dismissed them as superstition—until now. [540]

She reread the last line of the map’s legend: *"Beneath the last bloom, the truth waits."* [561]
Her hands stilled. [565]
The last bloom had been the oasis’s final gift before it withered, a single flower preserved in the city’s archives. [593]
If she wanted answers, she would have to go there. [607]

The next morning, Liora packed a satchel with the reassembled map, the postal plate fragment, and a vial of ink. [630]
She stepped into the greenhouse city’s humid embrace, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and decay. [654]
The streets were crowded with merchants hawking synthetic flowers and purifiers that no longer worked, their voices a dull hum beneath the constant drip of condensation. [691]

The archives were housed in the city’s oldest dome, its glass panels cracked with age. [712]
Liora navigated the labyrinth of shelves until she found the display case labeled *The Last Bloom*. [735]
Inside, a single blue flower lay preserved under glass, its petals brittle with time. [755]
She pressed her palm against the case, feeling the weight of the moment. [773]

Then she saw it—a small, almost invisible seam in the floor beneath the display. [792]
Her pulse quickened. [796]
With a knife from her satchel, she pried up the panel, revealing a narrow staircase descending into darkness. [822]
The map had been right. [827]
