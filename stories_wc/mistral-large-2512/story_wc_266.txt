The ferryman’s hands were steady, even as the last light bled into the horizon. [13]
His name was Elias, and he had guided travelers across the Veiled Ridgeway for thirty years, though none ever asked how he knew the currents so well. [39]
Tonight, the water lapped at the hull like a shoreline lullaby, soft and rhythmic, lulling the world into stillness. [64]
A single passenger stood at the bow, clutching a ticket punch with a star stamp—its edges worn smooth from years of use. [90]

"You’re not running from something," Elias said, more statement than question. [103]
The passenger, a woman named Mira, turned slightly, her silhouette sharp against the fading sky. [120]
"No," she admitted. [122]
"Then you’re running *toward* it." [127]
She didn’t answer, but the way her fingers tightened around the punch told him enough. [145]

The leash had broken years ago, on a night much like this one. [158]
Mira had been a clerk then, stamping tickets for trains that never came, her courage locked away in the monotony of routines. [181]
But the day the stationmaster handed her the punch with the star stamp—reserved for special passengers—something inside her had cracked. [210]
She had stamped her own ticket that night, walked out the door, and never looked back. [229]

Now, she needed to find where unused courage waits. [239]
Elias knew the Ridgeway’s secrets, the indirect routes that wound through mist and memory. [257]
"Most take the straight path," he said, steering the ferry toward a narrow inlet. [272]
"But the best things hide in the bends." [281]

The vigil in twilight had begun. [288]
Mira watched as the last sliver of sun disappeared behind the ridge, leaving only a violet glow. [311]
She had spent years waiting for permission to act, for the world to hand her a map. [332]
But courage, she realized, wasn’t something you found—it was something you *traversed*. [349]

Elias hummed an old tune, his voice gently persistent, coaxing the ferry forward. [366]
The water here was deceptive, shallow in some places, fathomless in others. [382]
Mira’s ticket punch glinted in the dim light, the star stamp catching the reflection of the first stars. [404]
"Where does this lead?" she asked. [412]

"To the other side," Elias said, smiling. [421]
"But not the one you expect." [428]

The ferry scraped against unseen rocks, jolting Mira from her thoughts. [444]
Elias adjusted their course, guiding them through a labyrinth of reeds and shadow. [460]
The air smelled of damp earth and salt, the scent of a place caught between land and sea. [481]
Mira exhaled, her breath visible in the cooling air. [493]

"You ever wonder why we’re afraid of the dark?" Elias asked suddenly. [511]
Mira shook her head. [515]
"Because it’s where we see ourselves clearly," he said. [529]
She looked down at the punch in her hand, the star stamp now glowing faintly, as if lit from within. [551]

The ferry emerged into a cove, its shores lined with lanterns. [566]
Figures moved in the distance, their faces obscured by hoods, but their voices carried on the wind—soft, murmuring, like a chorus of the forgotten. [595]
Mira’s pulse quickened. [601]

"This is where they come," Elias said, his voice barely above a whisper. [618]
"The ones who left too soon, or stayed too long." [631]
Mira stepped onto the shore, the wet sand sucking at her boots. [645]
The lanterns flickered, casting long shadows that danced like memories. [661]

She raised the ticket punch, pressing it against the air. [672]
The star stamp left no mark, but something inside her shifted. [687]
For the first time in years, she didn’t feel like a passenger. [702]

Elias watched from the ferry, his expression unreadable. [714]
"Now you know," he said. [720]
Mira turned back to the water, the Ridgeway stretching behind her like a promise. [736]
The vigil in twilight was over. [743]
But the journey had only just begun. [751]

The stars burned brighter now, as if welcoming her. [763]
She took a step forward, then another, her boots sinking into the sand. [780]
Somewhere ahead, unused courage waited. [788]
And she would find it. [793]
