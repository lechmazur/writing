The bunker builder’s claustrophobic child, Liora, had never known the sky as anything but a rumor. [14]
Her father had carved their refuge into the belly of the mountain, where the walls pressed in like the ribs of some great slumbering beast. [38]
But tonight, the world had tipped itself inside out—gravity inverted for an hour, and the trellis above the clouds, that xenial lattice of woven vines and silver wire, had become the only path upward. [77]
Liora clutched the tiny porcelain doll her mother had left behind, its painted smile chipped at the edges, its hollow eyes reflecting nothing. [106]
She didn’t know why she carried it, only that its weight was intangibly tangible, a ghost in her palm that refused to dissolve. [132]

The gilded hush of the inverted world settled over her like a second skin. [148]
Sound didn’t travel the same way here—voices frayed at the edges, whispers stretched into something thick and syrupy, as if the air itself had been starched. [179]
Liora had spent her life listening to the flavors of different silences, parsing the hollow echo of a closed door, the dampened thud of her father’s footsteps, the way the bunker’s breath hitched when the vents clogged. [223]
But this silence was different. [226]
It tasted like ozone and possibility, like the moment before a storm when the wind holds its breath. [249]

She stepped onto the trellis, her bare feet sinking into the damp, spongy vines. [265]
The structure had sprouted overnight, or so the travelers said—no one knew who had woven it, only that it appeared when gravity inverted, a bridge between the earth and the upside-down sky. [307]
Liora’s father had forbidden her to go near it. [317]
*"The world isn’t made for children who can’t breathe in small spaces,"* he’d said, his voice rough as gravel. [344]
But Liora had spent her life learning to breathe in places that wanted to crush her. [362]
This was the first time the world had offered her space instead. [374]

By limiting exposure, she told herself, she could survive. [385]
One step at a time. [390]
The trellis groaned beneath her, the vines twisting like living things. [407]
She imagined them as fingers, reaching not to pull her down, but to lift her up. [430]
The porcelain doll in her pocket grew heavier with each step, as if it, too, was straining against the strange new pull of the world. [461]

Above her, the clouds hung like a ceiling, their undersides lit by some unseen glow. [482]
She had never seen so much light in one place. [495]
It hurt her eyes, but she didn’t look away. [504]
The silence here was sweeter, richer—like honey left too long in the comb. [523]
She wanted to collect it, to press it into jars and label each one: *The hush of a world turned wrong. The quiet of a girl who was never supposed to be here.* [560]

A voice drifted toward her, stretched thin by the inverted air. [573]
*"You’re not supposed to be up here."* [581]
Liora turned. [584]
A boy stood a few paces away, his feet planted on the trellis as if he’d been born to it. [608]
His eyes were wide, not with fear, but with something like recognition. [626]
*"I know,"* she said. [630]
*"But neither are you."* [635]

The boy grinned. [638]
*"I come every time it inverts. [646]
The silence tastes different up here."* [655]
Liora understood. [658]
She pulled the doll from her pocket and held it out. [670]
Its porcelain face was cold, but the boy took it anyway, turning it over in his hands. [690]
*"My mother left it behind,"* she said. [699]
*"I think it was supposed to keep me safe."* [711]

The boy studied the doll, then handed it back. [721]
*"Maybe it did,"* he said. [726]
*"Or maybe you were always the one who was supposed to keep it safe."* [747]

Liora tucked the doll back into her pocket. [756]
The trellis swayed beneath them, the vines creaking like old bones. [772]
She could feel gravity shifting, the world righting itself inch by inch. [789]
The boy reached out, his fingers brushing hers. [800]
*"Next time,"* he said. [804]

Liora nodded. [806]
She knew there would be a next time. [813]
The bunker would still be there, the walls still pressing in. [827]
But so would the trellis. [833]
And so would she. [837]</story>
