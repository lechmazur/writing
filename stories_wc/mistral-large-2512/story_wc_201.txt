The anesthesia had worn off hours ago, but Elias still felt the ghost of its numbness clinging to his nerves. [18]
He stood at the edge of the ultraviolet forest, where the trees pulsed with an eerie violet glow, their leaves absorbing the light rather than reflecting it. [47]
The air smelled of ozone and something metallic, like blood left to dry in the sun. [65]
Elias flexed his fingers, testing the limits of his proprioceptively enhanced body—each movement precise, each joint a calculated equation. [90]
The surgeons had given him this gift, or curse, after the interrogations, when they realized he could endure more than most. [116]

A pewter mask strap lay coiled in his palm, its surface dull except for the faint engravings of numbers along its edge. [138]
He had found it in the ruins of the facility, tucked beneath a shattered interrogation chair. [155]
The strap was all that remained of the mask they had strapped to his face, the one that had fed him ultraviolet light until his retinas burned. [182]
Now, he wore it like a relic, a reminder of what he had survived—and what he still owed. [203]

The forest stretched before him, a labyrinth of violet shadows and shifting geometry. [218]
Elias had come here seeking answers, though he wasn’t sure what questions to ask. [234]
His motivation was simple, if impossible: to discover the mathematics of mercy. [249]
Not forgiveness—he didn’t believe in that anymore—but the exact formula for how much suffering one could inflict before the balance tipped into irredeemable cruelty. [278]

He braced himself against a tree, its bark slick with ultraviolet resin. [292]
The contact sent a jolt through his fingers, a phantom pain that mirrored the interrogations. [310]
Elias had learned to navigate the world by remembering through trauma responses, his body reacting before his mind could catch up. [335]
The forest seemed to recognize this, its light flickering in patterns that matched his pulse. [352]

A figure emerged from the trees, their silhouette warped by the ultraviolet glow. [368]
Elias didn’t flinch—he had expected someone, though not this soon. [382]
The stranger wore a mask of their own, but theirs was made of polished bone, the straps woven from sinew. [405]
"You’re the one they called the Calculator," the figure said, their voice like dry leaves. [422]

Elias nodded. [424]
He had earned the name during the interrogations, when he had tried to quantify pain, to assign it numbers and variables. [449]
The interrogators had found it amusing, until he started predicting their next moves with unsettling accuracy. [468]

The stranger extended a hand, palm up. [475]
In it lay a small ultraviolet penance—a vial of glowing liquid, its contents swirling with equations. [495]
"Drink this," they said. "It will show you the truth." [508]

Elias hesitated. [510]
He had spent years avoiding anything that resembled the light they had forced upon him. [530]
But the vial’s contents were different—softer, almost gentle. [542]
He uncorked it and drank. [547]

The liquid burned, but not like the interrogations. [557]
This was a different kind of fire, one that illuminated rather than destroyed. [573]
The forest around him shifted, the trees rearranging themselves into a perfect geometric grid. [592]
Numbers floated in the air, equations he had once scribbled on the walls of his cell. [612]

The stranger watched him, their mask tilting slightly. [623]
"You wanted to know the mathematics of mercy," they said. [636]
"Here it is." [640]

Elias saw it then—the balance, the symmetry. [652]
Mercy wasn’t a fixed value; it was a variable, shifting with each act of cruelty and kindness. [673]
The interrogations had taught him that, but he had been too broken to understand. [693]

He looked down at the pewter mask strap in his hand, the numbers along its edge now glowing faintly. [716]
They weren’t just engravings—they were a key. [727]
A way to measure the unmeasurable. [736]

The stranger stepped back, their silhouette dissolving into the ultraviolet haze. [751]
Elias didn’t try to stop them. [758]
He had what he came for. [764]

The forest pulsed around him, the equations still hanging in the air. [778]
He braced himself again, this time not against the tree, but against the weight of what he had learned. [801]
The mathematics of mercy wasn’t about absolution. [811]
It was about knowing when to stop. [820]
