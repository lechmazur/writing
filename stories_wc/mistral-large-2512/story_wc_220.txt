The scrapyard settlement sprawled like a rusted carcass across the cracked wasteland, its skeletal remains of old machines and war-torn vehicles groaning under the weight of time. [23]
Elias Voss had once been the best bloodhound in the Resource Wars, his nose leading him to bodies others couldn’t find—until the day he found one too many and his hands began to shake. [58]
Now, he lived in the belly of a hollowed-out transport truck, its walls lined with maps of the dead, each pin marking a soul he’d failed to save. [91]

The autumn leaf preserved in wax sat on his makeshift desk, its edges curled like the fingers of a corpse. [113]
It had been pressed into his palm by a dying soldier in the last days of the war, the man’s breath rattling like a phonograph needle skipping grooves. [143]
*"Keep it,"* the soldier had whispered, *"so you remember what’s worth finding."* [159]
Elias didn’t need the reminder, but he kept it anyway, the wax sealing in the scent of damp earth and decay, a perfume of the world before the fires. [190]

The settlement’s wild hush was broken only by the wind howling through the scrap, a sound like a thousand voices whispering secrets. [217]
Elias had come here to escape the ghosts of his past, but the wasteland had a way of pulling them closer, as if distance were just another kind of lie. [250]
His motivation was simple: to translate that distance into closeness, to make the dead feel less far away. [273]

The riddle came to him on a scrap of paper slipped under his door, the ink smudged as if written in haste. [292]
*"I speak without a mouth, hear without ears, and vanish when you need me most. What am I?"* [314]
Elias knew the answer—an echo—but the real question was why someone had left it for him. [337]

That night, he found the phonograph cylinder tucked into the hollow of a rusted oil drum, its grooves glinting under the moonlight. [361]
It was an old military model, the kind used to transmit coded messages during the war, and when he placed it on the turntable, the needle hissed to life. [392]
The voice that emerged was thin, strained, as if speaking from the other side of a grave. [414]
*"Voss, if you’re hearing this, you’re the only one left who can find her."* [433]

The words sent a chill down his spine. [444]
He knew that voice—Captain Liora Vey, the last person he’d searched for before retiring. [463]
She’d vanished in the final battle, her body never recovered, and Elias had assumed she’d been incinerated in the crossfire. [491]

The cylinder spun, the needle tracing the secret texts hidden in its grooves, each click and pop a syllable of a story he wasn’t sure he wanted to hear. [523]
*"They’re not dead,"* the recording continued, *"not all of them. The war didn’t end—it just went underground. They’re taking people, Voss. Not to kill them, but to change them."* [560]
Elias’s hands trembled as he adjusted the speed, the voice warping into something almost inhuman, a chorus of whispers layered beneath the words. [595]

The autumn leaf in its wax prison seemed to pulse in the dim light, its veins darkening like cracks in old bone. [621]
Tinted revelations, he thought—truths that came not in clear glass, but in stained, distorted fragments. [644]
The phonograph’s message was one such fragment, and it pointed to a single name: *The Hollows*, a network of tunnels beneath the wasteland where the war’s survivors had been taken. [685]

Elias had spent years running from the dead, but now they were calling him back. [705]
He packed his bag with the leaf, a knife, and the last of his courage, the riddle’s answer echoing in his mind. [728]
The dead weren’t gone—they were waiting. [738]
And if he wanted to bring them closer, he’d have to walk into the dark. [757]
