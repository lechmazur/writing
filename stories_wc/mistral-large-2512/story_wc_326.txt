The opal observatory stood like a frozen jewel beneath the snow, its domed roof dusted with white, refracting the moonlight into a thousand fractured colors. [23]
Elias had come here after the radio static cleared, when the world outside had finally gone quiet enough for him to hear his own thoughts again. [54]
He was a death certificate error survivor—his name had been mistakenly printed on a slip of paper meant for another man, a stranger who had died in a car crash on the same day Elias had walked out of the hospital, alive. [105]
The bureaucratic mistake had haunted him for years, not because he feared death, but because he couldn’t shake the feeling that he had borrowed time he didn’t deserve. [142]

Inside the observatory, the air smelled of old paper and cold metal, the scent of a place where time moved differently. [168]
Elias pressed his fingers against the porcelain shard in his pocket, its edges smooth from years of handling. [190]
It was all that remained of his mother’s favorite teacup, the one she had dropped the night before she died, the night the doctors had first mentioned the word *terminal*. [228]
He had kept it as a reminder, though of what, he wasn’t sure—her fragility, his own, or the way life could shatter in an instant. [260]

The digital ghost appeared without warning, flickering into existence on the observatory’s ancient monitor. [282]
It was a glitch in the system, a fragment of code that had outlived its purpose, a remnant of some long-dead astronomer’s work. [315]
Elias had first seen it weeks ago, when he had come here to escape the noise of the city, to count his heartbeats in the silence. [345]
One hundred and three, one hundred and four, one hundred and five—he had always done it, even as a child, as if measuring the rhythm of his life could make it feel more real. [380]

The ghost’s form was indistinct, a shifting mass of pixels that resolved into something like a face only when Elias stared too long. [410]
It spoke in a voice like static, its words forming through ephemeral patterns in spilled ink on the screen, letters bleeding and rearranging themselves into sentences. [445]
*"You are looking for answers,"* it said, the ink pooling into the shape of a question mark before dissolving. [468]

Elias exhaled, his breath fogging the cold air. [480]
He had come here to fetch wisdom from failure, though he wasn’t sure what that meant anymore. [503]
His own failures were too many to count—the job he had quit, the relationships he had let wither, the way he had stood frozen at his mother’s bedside, unable to say the things he should have. [545]
The ghost seemed to understand. [552]
*"Defragment,"* it whispered, the ink swirling into a spiral. [565]

Elias frowned. [567]
"Like a hard drive?" [572]
The ghost’s pixels pulsed. [576]
*"Like a life,"* the ink wrote, then scattered. [586]

He thought of the death certificate, the way it had arrived in the mail like a bad omen, the way he had carried it in his wallet for years, as if it were a talisman. [628]
He thought of the porcelain shard, smooth and cold against his skin. [645]
He thought of his mother’s voice, the way she had hummed while making tea, the way she had never once counted her heartbeats, as if she had known, somehow, that she didn’t need to. [692]

The ghost’s form flickered, its edges dissolving into the static. [708]
*"You are not the sum of your mistakes,"* it said, the ink forming the words slowly, deliberately. [733]
*"You are the space between them."* [742]

Elias closed his eyes. [746]
One hundred and one, one hundred and two, one hundred and three—his heart beat steadily, a rhythm he had spent a lifetime measuring. [775]
When he opened them again, the ghost was gone, the screen dark except for a single line of text, fading even as he read it: [803]
*"The stars are still watching."* [810]
