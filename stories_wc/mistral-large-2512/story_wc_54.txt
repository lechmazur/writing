The abandoned spaceport passenger terminal stretched before Mara like a cathedral of forgotten dreams. [13]
She adjusted the strap of her toolbag, the weight of her curiosity pressing against her ribs. [27]
As a civil engineer intern, she had been assigned to assess structural integrity, but the terminal’s crumbling grandeur whispered of something more. [51]
The carnival had left only hours before, its neon residue still clinging to the air like a half-remembered promise. [73]

Mara stepped over a collapsed turnstile, her boots crunching on broken glass. [86]
The sextant piece lay half-buried in the dust near a shattered viewport, its brass gleaming despite the decay. [107]
She crouched, brushing away the grime to reveal the intricate engravings—constellations mapped in a language she didn’t recognize. [130]
A maze of intentions, she thought, tracing the grooves with her fingertip. [144]
The terminal had been designed for departures, but now it was a labyrinth of stalled purpose. [161]

Her supervisor had called her "functionally creative," a backhanded compliment that stung less than it should have. [180]
Mara had always seen patterns where others saw chaos—equations in the way water carved stone, hope in the skeletal remains of ambition. [203]
She pocketed the sextant piece, its weight a question she couldn’t yet answer. [218]

The terminal’s central atrium loomed ahead, its ceiling a lattice of collapsed walkways. [234]
Mara mapped the damage in her mind, calculating load-bearing points, but her thoughts kept drifting to the sextant. [255]
What had it guided? A ship? A dream? [262]
She imagined the explorer who’d carried it, their fingers adjusting the dials as they charted a course through the unknown. [285]

A sound echoed—a trickle of water, redirected through a broken pipe. [298]
Mara followed it, her pulse quickening. [305]
The terminal’s old irrigation system had been jury-rigged, its flows rerouted to sustain something hidden. [323]
She knelt beside a patch of stubborn greenery, the plants thriving against all odds. [339]
Someone had resurrected life here, not through magic, but through redirected flows. [356]

Her breath caught. [360]
The sextant piece burned in her pocket. [366]
This wasn’t just an assessment—it was a puzzle, a new equation for hope. [381]
The terminal had been abandoned, but not forgotten. [390]
Someone had stayed, tending the ruins like a garden. [402]

Mara followed the water’s path deeper into the terminal, her footsteps silent on the cracked tile. [422]
She found the source: a makeshift greenhouse built from scavenged panels, its glass fogged with condensation. [443]
Inside, a woman knelt among the plants, her hands steady as she pruned a vine. [459]
She looked up, her eyes sharp with recognition. [469]
"You’re the engineer," she said. [475]

Mara nodded, extending the sextant piece. [482]
The woman took it, her fingers brushing the engravings. [491]
"I thought I lost this years ago," she murmured. [502]
Mara’s throat tightened. [507]
"You stayed," she said. [511]

The woman smiled, weary but unbroken. [518]
"Someone had to. The carnival leaves, but the world keeps turning." [533]
She gestured to the greenhouse. [539]
"Hope isn’t about grand gestures. It’s about redirecting what’s already here." [556]

Mara thought of the terminal’s bones, the way the water flowed, the way the sextant had led her here. [579]
She pulled out her notebook, sketching the greenhouse’s design, the irrigation paths, the equations of survival. [598]
The woman watched, then handed back the sextant piece. [610]
"Take it," she said. [613]
"Maybe you’ll find a new constellation." [622]

Mara slipped it into her pocket, the weight familiar now. [634]
Outside, the wind howled through the empty terminal, but inside, the plants grew. [650]
She had come to assess decay, but she was leaving with something else—a blueprint for resilience. [672]
The maze of intentions had led her here, to a truth simpler than she’d expected: [690]
Hope wasn’t about building anew. [697]
It was about resurrecting what was already there, one redirected flow at a time. [719]

She turned back toward the light, the sextant piece warm against her thigh. [734]
The terminal wasn’t just a ruin. [741]
It was a beginning. [745]
