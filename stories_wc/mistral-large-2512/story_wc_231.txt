The opal dock glowed faintly under the bruised sky of nautical twilight, its planks slick with mist that curled like ghostly fingers around Elias Vey’s boots. [23]
He had been the lighthouse keeper of Blackthorn Point for seventeen years, and in all that time, no one had ever set foot on this dock except him—until tonight. [56]
The stranger had arrived two hours earlier, his silhouette wavering in the fog before collapsing onto the weathered bench at the dock’s end. [87]
Elias had watched from the tower, his breath fogging the salt-crusted glass, as the man fumbled with something small and pale in his hands. [122]
Now, with the tide lapping softly against the pilings, Elias knelt beside the bench, his fingers brushing the dried Edelweiss boutonnière the stranger had left behind. [156]
The flower was brittle, its petals like parchment, yet it carried the faintest scent of alpine air—a memory Elias had never owned. [184]

He turned the boutonnière over, searching for clues. [195]
The stranger had died quietly, his last breath escaping like a whisper lost to the wind. [218]
No note, no name, just this fragile relic and the way his fingers had trembled as he pinned it to his lapel before slumping forward. [249]
Elias had seen death before—shipwrecks, drownings, the slow withering of old sailors—but this was different. [272]
This man had carried something heavier than grief. [283]

The lighthouse beam swept over the dock, casting long shadows that flickered like half-remembered dreams. [308]
Elias had always been a man of routine: polishing the brass, winding the clockwork, watching the sea’s endless patience. [335]
But tonight, the routine felt hollow. [345]
The stranger’s presence lingered, softly persistent, like the hum of a tuning fork struck hours ago. [370]

He decided to investigate. [375]
Not by digging through pockets or rifling through bags—those would yield only facts, not answers. [398]
Instead, Elias would observe the gaps. [408]
The things the stranger hadn’t done: no cry for help, no last words, no attempt to signal the lighthouse. [437]
The things he had done: the boutonnière, the way he’d stared at the horizon as if waiting for something that never came. [468]

Elias sat on the bench beside the empty space where the stranger had been. [492]
The mist thickened, swallowing the edges of the dock, and for a moment, he swore he could hear the crunch of snow under boots, the distant chime of cowbells. [530]
Borrowed memories, he realized. [535]
The stranger had carried them like a thief, and now they clung to Elias, insistent as the tide. [560]

He closed his eyes and let them wash over him. [571]
A mountain pass, a woman in a red shawl, the bitter taste of absinthe shared in a dimly lit café. [598]
The memories weren’t his, but they fit, like pieces of a puzzle he’d been assembling without knowing it. [629]
The stranger had been running from something—or toward something—and this dock, this moment, had been the end of the road. [664]

Elias opened his eyes. [670]
The boutonnière lay in his palm, its petals now slightly less brittle, as if the mist had breathed life back into them. [699]
He understood then: the man hadn’t come to die. [715]
He’d come to pass on what he couldn’t keep. [729]
The memories, the grief, the unspoken love for the woman in the shawl—all of it, borrowed and now bequeathed. [756]

The lighthouse beam swept over the dock again, illuminating the opal planks in a fleeting glow. [781]
Elias stood, the boutonnière pressed gently between his fingers. [797]
He would keep it, not as a relic, but as a promise. [814]
Somewhere, in the gaps between what was said and what was left unsaid, the stranger’s story lived on. [842]
And Elias would tend to it, softly persistent, like the light he kept burning for those who still wandered in the dark. [874]
