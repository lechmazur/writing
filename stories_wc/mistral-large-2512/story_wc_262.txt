The projection booth of the old Orpheum Theater smelled of celluloid and dust, a scent that clung to Mira like a second skin. [16]
She had spent the last three nights here, curled in the corner with a wool blanket, waiting for the film strip to speak. [41]
Not in words—she wasn’t that foolish—but in the way it *remembered*. [51]

Mira was a crystal gazer, though not the kind who pretended to see futures in quartz. [65]
She saw *spaces*: the hollows between breaths, the gaps where emotions pooled like water in cracked pavement. [85]
The Orpheum’s booth was one such space, a liminal pocket where time stretched thin. [102]
That’s why she’d chosen it to incubate her plan. [112]

The film strip lay across her lap, brittle and yellowed, its edges frayed like the hem of a well-worn dress. [135]
It was the last reel of *The Last Waltz*, a silent film from 1923, its star long dead, its plot forgotten. [156]
But the lyrics—oh, the lyrics had survived, scribbled in the margins of a script now lost. [173]
Mira had found them in a trunk in the theater’s basement, ink faded but legible: *"Where do the songs go when the music stops?"* [196]
She’d been searching for their tune ever since. [205]

Her method was psychometry reading, a way of touching an object and letting it touch her back. [223]
She’d learned it from her grandmother, who’d pressed a silver locket into her palm at twelve and said, *"Feel the weight of the unsaid."* [246]
Now, Mira ran her fingers along the film’s perforations, tracing the path of light that had once danced through them. [270]
The booth hummed around her, the projector’s gears dormant but not dead, like a heart in hibernation. [291]

She was here for the love letters. [297]
Not the kind sealed with wax and ribbon, but the ones never sent—the ones people wrote in their heads while staring at ceilings or train windows. [328]
Mira believed those letters didn’t vanish. [335]
They were stored somewhere, in the same way unused songs were stored in the air, waiting for the right throat to sing them. [362]
She just had to find where. [369]

The film strip warmed under her touch. [376]
Not with heat, but with *pressure*, like the weight of a held breath. [391]
She closed her eyes and let the images come. [401]

A woman in a cloche hat, her lips moving soundlessly in the flickering dark. [418]
She was mouthing the forgotten lyrics, her fingers tapping the armrest in time with a melody no one else could hear. [446]
Mira’s chest tightened. [451]
This was the star of *The Last Waltz*, the one who’d loved the composer, the one who’d whispered the song to him in the projection booth after hours. [486]
He’d written it down, then lost it, then forgotten it entirely when she left him for Paris. [511]

The booth trembled. [515]
Not from the projector—this was something deeper, like the shudder of a held note finally released. [541]
Mira’s breath came in short, sharp bursts. [552]
She could *see* it now: the storage place. [561]
Not a physical location, but a *shape*—a vast, echoing cavity behind the screen, where the theater’s unused love pooled like liquid silver. [598]
The letters were there, suspended in the dark, their ink never drying. [617]

The film strip curled in her hands, its edges blackening as if singed. [632]
Mira didn’t flinch. [636]
She leaned into the vision, her voice low, a hushed thunder in the cramped space. [658]
*"I’ll find you,"* she promised the star, the composer, the letters. [672]
*"I’ll bring the tune back."* [680]

The projector whirred to life on its own. [688]
Light spilled through the film, casting the forgotten lyrics onto the wall in jagged, dancing letters. [712]
Mira smiled. [715]
The song had been here all along. [724]
It just needed someone to listen. [733]

She reached for the pen in her pocket, the one she’d stolen from the composer’s desk in the vision. [755]
The ink was still wet. [760]
