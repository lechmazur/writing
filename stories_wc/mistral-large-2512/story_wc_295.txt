The observatory’s dome groaned as the wind scraped against its iron ribs, a sound like distant whispers from the cosmos. [16]
Elias Veyra adjusted the brass eyepiece of the refractor, his fingers trembling not from the cold but from the weight of what he was about to witness. [43]
As the lucid dream chronicler of the Celestial Mapping Guild, he had spent years transcribing the fleeting visions of stargazers who slept beneath the observatory’s vaulted ceiling, their minds drifting through the void like comets. [88]
But tonight, the dreams were different—sharper, more insistent, as if the stars themselves were trying to speak. [114]

A daylily-pressed telegram lay on his desk, its petals brittle with age, the ink faded but still legible. [135]
*"The inscriptions do not lie. The burden is ours to share."* [147]
The message had arrived that morning, unsigned, its origin as mysterious as the temple ruins it referenced. [168]
Elias had spent his life healing with words, stitching together fragments of dreams into narratives that soothed the restless, but this—this was something else. [198]
The temple inscriptions had defied translation for centuries, their symbols shifting like variable stars, their meaning elusive as a dream upon waking. [228]

He turned the telegram over, tracing the pressed petals with his thumb. [240]
The daylily was a symbol of fleeting beauty, of things that bloomed and withered in the span of a single day. [262]
It was the perfect metaphor for the dreams he chronicled, for the way understanding often dawned only when it was too late to act. [288]
But not tonight. [291]
Tonight, the stars were aligning, their light bending through the observatory’s lens in a way that made the air hum with possibility. [323]

The first dream had come to him three nights prior—a vision of a temple carved into the side of a mountain, its steps worn smooth by time. [353]
The dreamer, a young astronomer named Liora, had described the inscriptions as living things, their lines writhing like serpents before settling into patterns that made her skin prickle with recognition. [394]
Elias had written it all down, his pen moving faster than his thoughts, but the words had felt hollow, as if he were missing something vital. [429]
Then came the second dream, and the third, each one more vivid than the last, each one pointing to the same place: the temple, the inscriptions, the shared burden. [469]

He exhaled, his breath fogging the glass of the eyepiece. [482]
The observatory’s clock chimed midnight, its toll echoing through the cavernous space like a funeral bell. [503]
Elias closed his eyes and let the dreams wash over him, not as a chronicler this time, but as a witness. [529]
The temple materialized in his mind, its stones glowing faintly under the light of a thousand stars. [553]
The inscriptions pulsed, their meaning unfolding like a flower blooming in reverse, petals retracting to reveal the heart of the message. [588]
*"The weight you carry is not yours alone."* [598]

His hands clenched into fists. [602]
The dreams had been trying to tell him this all along, but he had been too focused on decoding the symbols to see the truth. [633]
The inscriptions weren’t a puzzle to be solved—they were an invitation. [651]
A call to share the burden, to lighten the load by dividing it among those who could bear it. [678]
He thought of Liora, of the way her eyes had shone with fear and wonder when she recounted her dream, of the way her voice had cracked when she spoke of the weight pressing down on her chest. [727]
She wasn’t the only one. [734]
The dreams had been coming to all of them, a silent chorus of shared pain. [754]

Elias stood, his chair scraping against the stone floor. [766]
The observatory’s dome creaked above him, the stars wheeling in their ancient dance. [785]
He knew what he had to do. [793]
The words would heal, but only if they were spoken aloud, only if they were shared. [817]
He would gather the dreamers, would read the inscriptions to them not as a riddle, but as a promise. [842]
The burden was theirs to carry, but not alone. [855]
Not anymore. [857]
