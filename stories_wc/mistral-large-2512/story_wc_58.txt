The garden was a place of lonesome splendor, where autumn’s breath curled through the branches like a sigh too tired to finish. [18]
Lena had come here after the last ship sailed, when the harbor’s lanterns guttered into the dark and the city’s pulse slowed to a whisper. [46]
She was a traveler who wrote obituaries for the living—brief, vivid sketches of souls still drawing breath, though they had already begun to fade from the world. [82]
Tonight, the garden’s shadows clung to her like old grief, and she traced the paths between the withered roses, her fingers brushing the palace carpet weft thread she had stolen from the royal loom. [128]
It was a single golden strand, no thicker than a spider’s silk, but it hummed with the weight of a kingdom’s history. [156]

She had taken it the night she left the capital, when the king’s physicians declared his illness a mystery no herb could cure. [186]
The thread was part of the great carpet in the throne room, the one that depicted the land’s rivers and mountains in woven silk. [213]
Lena had watched the weavers at work for months, their needles flashing like fireflies in the dim light, and she had memorized the way the thread bent to form the curve of a coastline or the jagged edge of a cliff. [253]
She had not meant to steal it, but when the king’s absence was explained as a "retreat to the northern estates," she knew the truth: he was dying, and the court would rather weave lies than face the unraveling. [297]

Now, in the garden, she unspooled the thread between her fingers, letting it catch the pale moonlight. [320]
The king’s absence was not the first she had explained—nor would it be the last. [340]
She had written obituaries for generals who vanished after losing battles, for poets whose words grew too sharp for the censors, for lovers who slipped away in the night rather than endure another day of silence. [380]
Each time, she had projected their presence into the world, giving them a voice when they could no longer speak. [404]
It was an intimate act, this writing of the living, and it left her hollowed out, as if she were the one being buried. [433]

The garden’s air was thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, and Lena knelt to press the thread into the soil. [460]
She was trying to understand the geography of healing, to map the way grief moved through a person like a river carving stone. [489]
The king’s absence had left a wound in the kingdom, one that festered beneath the court’s polished veneer. [516]
She had seen it in the way the servants flinched at sudden noises, in the way the queen’s hands trembled when she thought no one was looking. [550]
The thread was her attempt to stitch the wound closed, to weave a new story where the king’s absence made sense. [583]

A gust of wind sent the last of the autumn leaves spiraling to the ground, and Lena closed her eyes. [610]
She imagined the thread growing roots, twisting through the soil like the veins of the earth, binding the garden to the palace, the palace to the kingdom, the kingdom to the people who still loved its king. [654]
It was a foolish hope, she knew, but it was all she had. [672]
The obituaries she wrote were not for the dead—they were for the living, a way to hold onto what was slipping away. [702]
And so she would keep writing, keep weaving, keep projecting presence into the spaces where absence had taken root. [731]
The garden’s shadows stretched long and thin, and Lena let them swallow her whole. [752]
[755]
