The herbalist’s underground garden smelled of damp earth and crushed mint, a scent so thick it clung to the back of Elias Voss’s throat like a promise. [20]
He adjusted the strap of his duffel bag, the flint arrowhead in his pocket pressing against his thigh—a relic he’d found three days prior, wedged between the roots of a black cohosh plant. [55]
It shouldn’t have been there, not in soil this rich, not in a place where the air itself seemed to hum with something gravitationally playful, as if the laws of physics had been rewritten just for this pocket of the world. [100]

Elias was a cryptid researcher, or so his business cards claimed. [110]
In truth, he was a man who had spent the last decade chasing shadows, only to realize the shadows were chasing him back. [132]
The missing return had changed everything—those who vanished into the woods only to reappear weeks later, hollow-eyed and murmuring about "the hum." [157]
They never stayed long. [162]

The herbalist, a woman named Maren with hands like gnarled roots, had invited him down here under the guise of studying "unusual botanical adaptations." [187]
But Elias knew better. [190]
The garden wasn’t just a garden. [195]
It was a threshold. [197]

He knelt beside a patch of glowing foxfire mushrooms, their caps pulsing faintly, as if breathing. [218]
The arrowhead in his pocket grew warm. [224]
Maren’s voice cut through the silence, low and knowing. [233]
"You feel it, don’t you? The way the air bends here." [244]

Elias didn’t answer. [247]
Instead, he pulled the arrowhead free and held it up to the dim light filtering through the soil above. [268]
The edges were too sharp, the craftsmanship too precise—no signs of weathering, as if it had been made yesterday. [291]
Maren’s breath hitched. [294]
"That’s not from here," she said. [300]

A harmony untamed, Elias thought. [305]
That’s what this place was. [310]
A pocket of the world where the rules of time and space didn’t just bend—they sang. [330]
He’d heard the stories, of course, the ones whispered at diners and campfires: people who stepped into the woods and came back different, their voices layered with static, their eyes reflecting something not quite human. [370]

Maren reached for the arrowhead, but Elias pulled it away. [380]
"Tell me about the phone," he said. [386]
Her lips thinned. [389]
The old cordless phone sat on a shelf beside jars of dried lavender, its plastic yellowed with age. [412]
It had no dial tone, no connection to the outside world. [427]
But sometimes, when the garden was quiet, it rang. [439]

Elias picked it up. [443]
The receiver was cold, the static inside it a living thing, crackling with voices that weren’t quite voices. [466]
Maren watched him, her expression unreadable. [474]
"You want to know why I let you come here?" she asked. [486]
"Because you’re the only one who hasn’t changed." [496]

Elias’s fingers tightened around the phone. [503]
He thought of the missing return, of the way their laughter had turned brittle, their joy souring into something jagged. [529]
Bitterness, he’d learned, was a kind of gravity—it pulled everything into its orbit. [548]
But here, in this garden, the rules were different. [560]

The phone buzzed in his hand, the static swelling into a voice. [573]
"Not real," it whispered. [576]
"Or maybe too real." [580]

Maren’s eyes gleamed. [584]
"Some of us come back wrong," she said. [593]
"Some of us don’t come back at all." [601]
Elias understood then. [605]
The arrowhead, the phone, the garden—it wasn’t about studying the strange. [620]
It was about surviving it. [624]

He pressed the phone to his ear. [630]
The static roared, and for a moment, he saw them—the ones who had vanished, standing in a circle beneath a sky that wasn’t a sky, their bodies flickering like candle flames. [670]
They were laughing. [673]
Not with joy, but with something sharper, something that tasted like frostbitten hope. [692]

Maren’s hand closed over his. [698]
"Let it go," she said. [702]
But Elias didn’t. [705]
He listened as the voices on the phone began to change, their words twisting into something new, something that made his bones ache. [735]
They weren’t confessions. [738]
They were invitations. [741]

The arrowhead in his pocket burned. [747]
Elias looked down and saw that his fingers were translucent, the veins beneath his skin glowing faintly blue. [770]
Maren’s grip tightened. [774]
"Don’t," she warned. [777]

But Elias had spent too long running from the dark to fear it now. [796]
He smiled, bitter and bright. [801]
"Maybe bitterness isn’t the end," he said. [809]
"Maybe it’s just the punchline." [815]

The garden hummed around him, the air bending, the rules rewriting themselves. [830]
And then— [832]
He metamorphosed. [834]
[835]
