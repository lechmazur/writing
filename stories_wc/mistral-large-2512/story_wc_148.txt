The lighthouse stood on the jagged reef like a broken tooth, its beam long dead, its walls slick with salt and time. [19]
Inside, Elias Voss—son of the boy who cried wolf—pressed his palm against the lattice of the confessional, its wood warped by decades of damp. [45]
He had come to thread the labyrinth of his own story, to weave something true from the lies his father had left behind. [72]
The prison was empty now, or so the guards claimed, but Elias knew better. [87]
Hush lived here, a thing that sustained impossibilities, a silence so thick it could smother a scream before it left the throat. [114]

The door to the warden’s quarters hung ajar, its scuffed surface whispering of the men who had slipped through it, never to return. [141]
Elias nudged it open with his boot, the hinge groaning like a dying breath. [157]
Inside, the air tasted of copper and old pennies, the kind of light that pooled in the corners like spilled wine. [178]
He hovered at the threshold, fingers brushing the lattice in his pocket, its splinters digging into his skin. [198]
This was where they kept the ledger—the names of the lost, the ones who had vanished before the bodies were found. [226]

A floorboard creaked behind him. [232]
Elias turned, but the hallway was empty, the shadows too deep to trust. [248]
He had spent his life chasing hush, the quiet that followed his father’s last lie, the silence that swallowed whole towns when the wolves never came. [278]
Now, here, in this lighthouse prison, he felt it pressing against his ribs, a weight that wasn’t quite air. [304]

The ledger lay open on the desk, its pages brittle with age. [317]
Elias traced the names with his fingertip, each one a story cut short. [332]
Then he saw his father’s—scratched out, as if even the ink had tried to forget. [348]
A noise like fabric tearing came from the stairwell, too close, too deliberate. [364]
Elias exhaled, slow and measured, and stepped back into the copperlight repose of the hallway. [386]

The confessional lattice in his pocket hummed, or maybe it was just the wind through the broken panes. [409]
He had come to thread the labyrinth, but the labyrinth was threading him instead, pulling him deeper into the hush. [438]
The door at the end of the hall swayed, though no breeze touched it. [454]
Elias approached, boots silent on the warped floorboards. [466]
Beyond it, the lantern room yawned, its glass shattered, its mechanism rusted into stillness. [487]

And there, in the center of the room, something hovered. [500]
Not a man, not quite—just a shape, a suggestion of limbs and a face that wasn’t there. [523]
It turned toward him, and Elias felt the hush coil around his throat like a noose. [544]
The lattice in his pocket burned. [551]
He understood then: the confessional hadn’t been for the guilty. [564]
It had been for the ones who knew the wolves were coming and said nothing. [583]

The shape drifted closer, and Elias did the only thing he could—he spoke. [600]
Not a scream, not a plea, but his own name, clear and true. [616]
The hush recoiled. [621]
The lattice in his pocket shattered. [630]
For the first time in decades, the lighthouse groaned, its beam flickering once, twice, then holding steady. [656]

Elias didn’t wait to see what would happen next. [668]
He ran, the scuffed door slamming behind him, the labyrinth unspooling at his heels. [688]
The guards would find the ledger, the names, the truth. [701]
But they wouldn’t find the bodies—not yet. [710]
And Elias? [713]
He would keep running, chasing the hush, threading his story through the cracks in the world. [736]
Because some lies were too heavy to carry, and some silences were meant to be broken. [756]
