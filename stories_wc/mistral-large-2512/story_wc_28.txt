The plaza stretched beneath a sky split like broken glass, its jagged edges holding back the storm that never came. [16]
Here, after the great fire, the air smelled of charred cedar and damp stone, a scent that clung to Liora’s robes as she knelt beside the shattered minaret. [45]
She was a gentle radical, her hands calloused from rebuilding what others had burned, her heart a quiet furnace of defiance. [72]
The mosaic tesserae of the minaret lay scattered like fallen stars, their gold and lapis surfaces catching the dim light filtering through the cracks above. [101]

Liora had been retrocognitively trapped since childhood, her mind a prison of memories not her own. [123]
She saw the plaza as it had been—alive with merchants, scholars, the laughter of children chasing pigeons—while the present crumbled around her. [148]
The past was a weight, but it was also a weapon. [159]
She had learned to wield it, to let the echoes of what was guide her hands as she pieced together what could be. [186]

Tonight, she worked by the glow of a single lantern, her fingers tracing the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone at her feet. [213]
The design was familiar: a spiral, a path, a name. [224]
She had found it days ago, half-buried in the ash, and something about it had lodged in her ribs like a splinter. [248]
Aberrant mercy—that was what the old texts called it. [258]
The kind of forgiveness that defied reason, that bent the rules of vengeance and grief until they snapped. [277]

Liora had spent years renaming the world. [285]
The burned library became the Nest of Second Dawn. [294]
The execution square, the Garden of Whispers. [301]
Names were spells, she believed, and if she spoke them right, the stones would listen. [321]
But this stepping stone was different. [328]
Its patterns told a story not of rebirth, but of erasure. [342]

She turned it over, revealing the underside where the tesserae had been pried loose. [358]
There, in the negative space, was a single word: *Amira*. [367]
Liora’s breath caught. [370]
Amira had been the name of the girl who’d lit the first torch during the great fire, the one who’d believed burning the old world would make way for the new. [405]
Liora had watched from the shadows as the flames took the minaret, as the mosaic shattered under the heat. [430]
She had done nothing. [435]

Now, the stepping stone felt like an accusation. [444]
Or an invitation. [447]
Aberrant mercy wasn’t about forgetting—it was about holding the weight of what had been done and still choosing to cradle empathy in arms of steel. [480]
Liora pressed her palm to the stone. [488]
The chipped patterns dug into her skin, but she didn’t flinch. [503]

She would rename this place again. [510]
Not the Plaza of Ashes, not the Ruin of the Fireborn. [522]
She would call it the Courtyard of the Unbroken Name. [533]
And beneath the shattered sky, she would kneel until the mosaic was whole, until the past and present bled together into something that could bear the weight of both. [572]

The lantern flickered, casting long shadows over the tesserae. [588]
Liora picked up a piece of lapis, its edge sharp enough to draw blood. [606]
She pressed it into the stepping stone’s empty space, where *Amira* had once been. [623]
The name would stay. [628]
But now, it would mean something else. [637]

The warm coldness of the night settled over her. [647]
She had spent so long trapped in the past that she’d forgotten how to live in the present. [670]
But the mosaic wouldn’t let her. [678]
It demanded she choose—between the girl who’d burned the world and the woman who was rebuilding it. [702]
Between vengeance and mercy. [707]

Liora exhaled, her breath curling into the air like smoke. [720]
She picked up another tessera. [727]
The plaza was quiet, the sky still broken. [736]
But for the first time in years, she wasn’t alone in it. [749][750]
