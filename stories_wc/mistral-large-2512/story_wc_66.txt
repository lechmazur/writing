In the ember alcove, where the last of the fire’s glow curled like a sleeping cat, Elias sat hunched over his desk. [18]
The air smelled of damp ash and old parchment, the kind of scent that clung to things long after their purpose had faded. [36]
As the diligent orchestra copyist, he had spent years transcribing notes that no one would ever hear, his fingers stained with ink that never dried. [66]
The world outside was silent now, after the story famine had swallowed every tale whole, leaving only echoes where voices once thrived. [94]

His shortwave radio sat on the shelf, its dial glow pulsing faintly, a secret heartbeat in the dark. [117]
Elias had found it years ago, buried beneath the rubble of a collapsed music hall, its wires still humming with the ghost of a frequency. [144]
No one knew it was secretly luminous, not even him at first—until the night he turned it on and the dial’s light spilled like liquid gold across his hands. [175]
That was when he heard the song. [183]

It came in fragments, a melody so soft it might have been the wind, if the wind had ever sung. [206]
The lyrics were elusive, slipping through his fingers like smoke, but he caught enough to know they were a key. [228]
*"Tell the dust what the stars forget,"* the voice whispered, *"and the night will remember its name."* [248]
Elias didn’t understand, but he wrote the words down anyway, his pen scratching against the page like a mouse in the walls. [274]

He had a motivation now, something to claw back the silence. [287]
If stories were gone, then he would teach the dust to tell them. [302]
Dust was everywhere—in the cracks of the floor, in the folds of his cloak, in the hollows of forgotten things. [325]
If he could make it speak, even just once, maybe the world would listen again. [345]

The pirate broadcast was his only hope. [356]
No one knew who sent it, or why, but Elias suspected it was someone like him: a keeper of lost things. [379]
He tuned the radio every night, waiting for the voice to return, for the song to reveal itself fully. [403]
The ember alcove was the perfect place for it—hidden, quiet, a pocket of warmth in the endless mist. [428]

One evening, as he adjusted the dial, the glow flared brighter, and the song swelled. [446]
*"Gather the grains that the wind left behind,"* the lyrics murmured, *"and spin them to gold with your mind."* [469]
Elias’s breath caught. [474]
That was it. [477]
The dust wasn’t just dust—it was the remnants of stories, ground fine by time. [499]
If he could weave them back together, maybe they’d sing again. [517]

He pulled his cloak tighter, the fabric worn thin from years of use, and reached for the jar on his desk. [544]
Inside, the dust swirled like a tiny storm, caught from the corners of the alcove where no one else bothered to look. [573]
Elias hummed the song under his breath, his voice rough but steady, and the dust began to glow. [598]
Not with fire, not with light, but with something older—a luminescence that pulsed in time with his heartbeat. [629]

The first word formed in the air, shimmering like a mirage. [643]
*"Listen,"* it said, and Elias laughed, the sound brittle but real. [660]
The dust remembered. [665]
It remembered the stories it had absorbed, the voices it had buried, the laughter and tears it had swallowed whole. [695]
And now, because of him, it was speaking. [708]

The radio crackled, the song fading into static, but Elias didn’t mind. [726]
He had what he needed. [733]
The next night, he would gather more dust, more fragments, and he would teach them all to sing. [756]
The ember alcove would no longer be a place of endings, but of beginnings. [778]
And maybe, just maybe, the world would hear them. [793]

The mist outside curled around the window, thick and indifferent, but Elias smiled. [816]
He had a story to tell. [824]
And this time, the dust would be his voice. [836]
