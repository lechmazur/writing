The grotto city of Vaelis hid behind the monumental waterfall like a secret whispered between stones. [14]
Its streets, carved into the damp rock, glistened under the perpetual mist, and the air smelled of wet moss and old paper. [36]
Liora Vey, a cultured museum guide with a voice like aged parchment, adjusted the emerald-tinted opera glass lens in her palm. [60]
Through it, the past sharpened—not just the ruins of the displaced persons who had once fled here, but the ghosts of their crafts, fading like ink in rain. [87]

She had come to Vaelis after the beekeeper’s last visit, when the hives above the waterfall had gone silent. [111]
The city’s elders said the bees had carried the last of the old songs in their wings, and without them, the grotto’s history would thaw like ice in spring. [140]
Liora believed them. [143]
Her own family had once baked bread shaped like initials, a custom that bound names to memory, but the tradition had crumbled when her grandmother died. [170]
Now, she sought to rescue dying arts before they dissolved entirely. [184]

The museum’s archivist, a gaunt man named Orlan, found her in the Hall of Echoes, where the waterfall’s roar seeped through the cracks. [208]
“You’re staring at the loom again,” he said. [215]
The threads hung loose, half-woven, as if the weaver had simply… stopped. [230]
Liora traced the pattern with her finger. [237]
“It’s the last of the Vaelis tapestries,” she murmured. [248]
“No one remembers how to finish it.” [255]

Orlan sighed. [257]
“Displaced persons brought the craft here, but displacement took it away.” [272]
He didn’t need to say more. [277]
The grotto had been a refuge, but refuges were never meant to last. [292]
Liora lifted the opera glass to her eye. [300]
Through the emerald tint, the tapestry’s unfinished edges glowed, as if the threads themselves were calling to her. [322]

That night, she dreamed of bread. [327]
Not just any bread—her grandmother’s, golden and stamped with the letter *V*. [343]
In the dream, the loaf spoke, its crust cracking like old parchment. [356]
*“You remember the shape, but not the weight.”* [366]
Liora woke with flour dust on her fingers. [375]

She went to the bakery at dawn, where the ovens had gone cold. [388]
The baker, a woman with hands like cracked leather, watched as Liora kneaded dough into the shape of a *V*. [412]
“My grandmother used to make these,” Liora said. [423]
The baker’s eyes darkened. [427]
“So did mine.” [430]
“Then why did we stop?” [436]

The baker didn’t answer. [439]
Instead, she handed Liora a rolling pin. [446]
“Shape it right, and maybe the bees will come back.” [460]

Liora worked in silence, the dough warm under her palms. [472]
She thought of the displaced persons who had carried their customs like seeds, planting them in the grotto’s damp soil. [497]
Some had taken root; others had withered. [505]
The opera glass in her pocket felt heavy. [513]

By noon, the bakery smelled of yeast and memory. [524]
The baker pulled the first loaf from the oven—perfect, golden, the *V* crisp at the edges. [542]
Liora held it, expecting… something. [550]
A revelation, a rush of the past. [557]
But the bread was just bread. [562]

Then, a hum. [565]
Faint, but unmistakable. [570]
The baker’s face lit up. [575]
“Listen.” [577]

Beyond the bakery’s window, a single bee landed on the sill. [591]
Then another. [594]
And another. [597]

Liora exhaled, the rosewater dread in her chest thawing into something lighter. [617]
The dying arts weren’t gone. [624]
They were just waiting. [628]

She returned to the museum with the loaf in her hands. [640]
Orlan took it, turning it over. [646]
“You baked it like an initial,” he said. [655]
“Not just mine,” Liora replied. [662]
“Theirs, too.” [666]

The opera glass in her pocket felt warm now. [676]
Through it, the unfinished tapestry no longer glowed. [689]
It *moved*, threads weaving themselves into place. [700]

The bees had returned. [704]
So would the rest. [708]
[710]
