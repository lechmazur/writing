The siskin alder grove hummed with a silence so deep it felt like a living thing, pressing against Elias’s skin as he knelt before the ancient sculpture. [19]
His fingers, calloused from years of shaping wood into tree-songs, traced the stress cracks spiderwebbing across the alder’s surface, each fissure a story of time and tension. [48]
This was no ordinary carving—it had been abandoned decades ago, left to weather the grove’s damp embrace, its once-fluid lines now jagged with age. [78]
Elias had found it half-buried in moss, a relic of some long-dead sculptor who, like him, had tried to coax music from the world’s quiet. [107]

He strummed his thumb along the deepest crack, listening. [114]
The wood vibrated, a faint resonance that shivered up his arm, not sound exactly, but the ghost of it—a whisper of what might have been. [143]
His symphonically minded mind, always attuned to the harmonies hidden in stillness, caught the echo and held it. [164]
This was empathy in motion, he realized: the act of reaching into something broken and finding the song it still wanted to sing. [188]

The porcelain insulator lay beside him, a smooth white orb no larger than his palm, its surface unmarred by time. [213]
It had been part of the old power lines that once stretched through the grove, before the world went silent and the wires were torn down. [240]
Elias had found it years ago, nestled in the roots of a siskin alder, and kept it ever since, though he’d never known why. [265]
Now, as he turned it over in his hands, he understood: it was a vessel, just like the sculpture. [282]
One held sound; the other, the potential for it. [294]

After the hedgehog uncurls—that was how the old ones measured time here, by the slow rhythms of creatures waking from winter’s grip. [322]
Elias had arrived at the grove just as the first hedgehog stirred, its spines trembling as it blinked into the dim light. [348]
The world was still cold, still quiet, but the uncurling was a promise: life would return, and with it, the chance to make music again. [378]

His motivation had always been simple: to create music in a silent world. [395]
Not the kind that filled concert halls, but the kind that lived in the spaces between things—the hum of a tree’s roots, the sigh of wind through alder leaves, the crack of ice melting into spring. [430]
He had spent his life chasing those sounds, shaping wood to amplify them, but this sculpture was different. [453]
It wasn’t just a vessel; it was a wound, and wounds, he knew, held their own kind of song. [475]

Elias set the porcelain insulator into the sculpture’s largest crack, wedging it tight. [491]
Then he strummed again, this time with his knuckles, a sharp, percussive strike that sent vibrations through the wood and into the insulator. [521]
A sound emerged—not a note, but a breath, a gasp of air escaping something long-held. [543]
The grove seemed to lean in, the alders rustling as if they, too, were listening. [563]

He repeated the motion, adjusting the angle of his hand, the pressure of his touch. [581]
The cracks in the sculpture weren’t flaws; they were channels, pathways for sound to travel. [602]
By analyzing their patterns, he could guide the vibrations, shape them into something deliberate. [623]
The porcelain insulator acted as a resonator, catching the echoes and sending them back, louder, clearer. [645]

A melody began to form, fragile and tentative, like the first notes of a waking bird. [666]
Elias closed his eyes, letting the sound wash over him. [679]
It wasn’t perfect—it was raw, uneven, the voice of something that had been broken and was only now remembering how to sing. [710]
But that was the point. [716]
Music in a silent world wasn’t about perfection; it was about presence, about the courage to make noise when the world had forgotten how. [750]

The hedgehog, now fully uncurled, watched him from a patch of moss, its dark eyes reflecting the dim light. [773]
Elias smiled. [776]
The grove was no longer silent. [783]
