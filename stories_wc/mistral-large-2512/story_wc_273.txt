The wind-carved encampment clung to the edge of the mesa like a half-remembered dream, its tents stitched from faded canvas and scavenged solar film. [19]
Elias Veyne, the albino tracker, crouched in the lee of a sandstone outcrop, his pale fingers tracing the grooves the wind had etched into the rock over centuries. [48]
He had come here not for shelter, but because the eclipse had just ended, and the world still hummed with the strange, lingering tension of celestial alignment. [86]

A faint whirring caught his attention—an artificial hummingbird drone, no larger than his palm, darted between the tents. [111]
Its iridescent wings caught the dim light, casting shifting patterns on the sand. [127]
Elias had seen these before, used by couriers to deliver messages in disappearing ink, a trick that left no trace once the words faded. [153]
He reached out, but the drone veered away, as if sensing his intent. [169]

Curiosity gnawed at him. [173]
Why would someone send a message here, of all places? [185]
The encampment was a waypoint for nomads and smugglers, not a hub of secrets. [203]
But then, Elias had always been drawn to things that didn’t belong. [218]
His albino eyes, sharp as broken glass, scanned the horizon. [230]
He had spent years tracking the unnatural, the things that slipped through the cracks of the world. [251]

A scream split the air. [255]
Elias was moving before he realized it, his boots kicking up dust as he sprinted toward the sound. [278]
A woman knelt in the center of the encampment, clutching a child whose skin had taken on a bluish tint. [302]
The child’s breath came in ragged gasps, each one slower than the last. [319]
Elias dropped to his knees beside them, his mind racing. [330]
Time was slowing, just as it always did in moments of crisis. [345]
He had spent his life trying to understand why. [355]

The woman sobbed, her hands trembling as she pressed them to the child’s chest. [373]
“It started after the eclipse,” she whispered. [381]
Elias’s gaze flicked to the child’s wrist, where a faint, shimmering mark pulsed like spilled ink. [406]
It moved in ephemeral patterns, shifting even as he watched. [421]
He had seen this before—in the aftermath of other crises, in the wake of other disappearances. [442]

The artificial hummingbird drone landed on the child’s shoulder, its wings stilling. [459]
A message bloomed on the boy’s skin, written in the same ink that now swirled across his wrist. [479]
Elias leaned closer, his breath shallow. [487]
The words were fading even as he read them: *"They’re taking the time."* [504]

A chill ran down his spine. [510]
He had always been consciously wild, a man who lived on the edges of civilization, but this—this was something else. [540]
The ink on the child’s skin began to spread, forming new patterns, new shapes. [560]
The boy’s breathing steadied, his color returning, but the ink didn’t stop. [579]
It pooled on the ground, then rose like smoke, twisting into a shape that looked almost human. [604]

Elias acted on instinct. [610]
He lunged forward, his fingers closing around the ink’s ephemeral form. [628]
It resisted, slipping through his grip like liquid shadow, but he held on, his albino eyes burning with serene anger. [655]
He had spent too long chasing answers to let this one disappear. [673]

The ink solidified for a moment, long enough for Elias to see the truth: it wasn’t just ink. [694]
It was time itself, stolen and reshaped. [706]
The child gasped, sitting up as if waking from a dream. [720]
The ink on his wrist faded completely, leaving no trace. [734]

Elias stood, his mind racing. [740]
The drone whirred to life, darting away into the desert. [754]
He didn’t follow. [757]
He knew where it was going—to the ones who had sent it, the ones who were stealing time from the world. [786]
And he would find them. [792]
But first, he had to understand why time slowed in crisis. [804]
Why it always seemed to bend for those who needed it most. [819]

The wind howled through the encampment, carrying the scent of dust and distant rain. [837]
Elias exhaled, his anger settling into something quieter, something more dangerous. [855]
He would track them. [859]
He would make them answer. [865]
And he would not disappear. [871]
[872]
