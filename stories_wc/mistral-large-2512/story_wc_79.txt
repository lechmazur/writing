The city of Carapax clung to the backs of three gargantuan turtles, their ancient shells grooved with streets and stairways worn smooth by centuries of footsteps. [20]
Mira adjusted the straps of her spiral-shell cartographer’s satchel, the weight of ink pots and parchment pressing against her ribs as she climbed the highest ridge of the middle turtle’s carapace. [51]
Below, the city sprawled like a living thing, its towers built from fused turtle bone and coral, their windows glowing amber in the late afternoon light. [83]
She had come to map the cracks. [88]

The gate had rusted shut fifty years ago, sealing Carapax from the world beyond the horizon. [108]
No one left. [111]
No one arrived. [114]
But the watchers remained—tall, motionless figures standing at the edge of the salt flats, their silhouettes blurred by heat haze. [141]
Mira had spent her life studying them through the lens of pattern languages, decoding the way they shifted their stances, the rhythm of their stillness. [170]
They never spoke. [173]
They never moved. [176]
But they were always watching. [180]

Her reed whistle hung from her neck, its hollow body carved with the same spiral motifs as her maps. [201]
She blew into it once, a soft, questioning note that dissolved into the salt-scented air. [218]
The watchers did not react. [222]
Mira exhaled through her teeth, the sound sharp with frustration. [234]
She had found the first crack yesterday—a hairline fracture in the eastern shell, near the old docks where the last expedition had set sail before the gate sealed. [264]
The city’s elders called it a flaw, a sign of decay. [276]
Mira called it a door. [280]

She knelt, pressing her palm to the warm shell, tracing the fracture with her fingertips. [297]
The pattern languages whispered to her: *This is how it begins.* [308]
The lost expedition had not vanished. [314]
They had gone through. [318]
And if they had, so could she. [325]

Mira pulled a chisel from her satchel, the metal cool against her skin. [339]
She tapped it against the crack, listening to the echo. [349]
The shell groaned, a deep, resonant sound like a sleeping beast stirring. [364]
She worked quietly, driven by something she could not name—curiosity, fear, the gnawing certainty that the watchers knew more than they let on. [398]
The fracture widened, jagged edges catching the light. [410]
Behind it, darkness yawned. [415]

She lit a lantern, its flame casting long shadows across the shell’s inner curve. [432]
The air smelled of damp and old secrets. [440]
Mira stepped inside. [444]

The tunnel sloped downward, the walls slick with moisture. [454]
Her boots splashed in shallow pools, the sound too loud in the suffocating dark. [470]
Then, ahead, a glow—faint, greenish, pulsing like a heartbeat. [485]
She followed it, her breath shallow. [492]

The tunnel opened into a cavern, its ceiling lost in shadow. [504]
At its center stood a circle of stone pillars, each carved with the same spiral patterns as her maps, as her whistle. [530]
And between them, the lost expedition. [537]

They were not dead. [540]
They were waiting. [543]
Their eyes were hollow, their skin stretched too tight over bone, but they moved—slowly, deliberately, as if bound by some unseen rhythm. [574]
One turned toward her, its mouth opening. [583]
No sound came out. [586]
But Mira understood. [590]

They had gone through the gate before it rusted shut. [600]
They had found the watchers. [604]
And the watchers had let them return—but not unchanged. [614]
The pattern languages had been a warning. [621]
A language of silence, of stillness, of things left unsaid. [632]

Mira’s hands trembled. [636]
She had spent her life questioning the watchers, but the real question was never about them. [654]
It was about what they guarded. [660]
And what they had already taken. [666]

She backed away, the lantern’s light flickering. [675]
The expedition did not follow. [680]
They only watched. [683]
Waiting. [685]

Mira ran. [688]
The tunnel seemed longer now, the air thicker, the darkness deeper. [704]
When she burst back into the sunwashed dread of Carapax, she did not stop. [720]
She sprinted down the spiral streets, her satchel bouncing against her hip, the reed whistle clattering against her chest. [743]
She did not look back. [747]

The watchers were still there, standing at the horizon. [757]
But now, she knew. [761]
They were not watching the city. [767]
They were watching the cracks. [773]

Mira reached the docks, her lungs burning. [781]
The old expedition ship still sat in its berth, its hull patched with barnacles and time. [799]
She boarded it, her fingers flying over the ropes, the sails. [812]
The gate was rusted shut, but the cracks were everywhere. [823]
And she would find them all. [828]
[830]
