The orchard drifted on its raft of driftwood, a stubborn island of green in the endless blue. [12]
Leeward, the tide prophet, stood at the edge where the branches dipped into the salt, his bare feet gripping the sun-bleached planks. [32]
He had always known the sea’s moods before they formed, but tonight the clouds moved differently—swirling in patterns that hummed, not warned. [56]
The blue hour had settled like a sigh between day and night, the light just thin enough to see the fractal paths the wind carved through the sky. [87]

His fingers twitched toward the xylophone mallet tucked into his belt, its wood worn smooth by years of striking not just keys, but the bones of the world. [123]
Leeward had never been one to fight the current; he turned obstacles into instruments, and the sea had given him plenty. [146]
The orchard itself was proof—roots tangled in driftwood, branches heavy with fruit that tasted of brine and stubbornness. [168]

Tonight, the clouds were his score. [174]
He squinted at the horizon, where the wind had begun to sketch resonance into the air, invisible lines that vibrated against his skin. [199]
The mallet felt warm in his palm as he lifted it, not to strike, but to *dub*—to press its tip against the driftwood and let the vibrations travel. [231]
The raft shivered, then sang, a low thrum that rippled through the water like a plucked string. [252]

The trees leaned in, their leaves rustling in time. [262]
Leeward closed his eyes and listened, not just with his ears, but with the soles of his feet, the roots of his hair, the salt in his veins. [289]
The fractal generating had begun—the sea’s chaos folding into rhythm, the clouds’ dance becoming melody. [311]
He struck the driftwood again, this time harder, and the sound split into harmonics, each note a branch of the pattern. [340]

A wave lapped at the raft, not in warning, but in answer. [353]
Leeward smiled. [355]
The blue hour was his now, the space between light and dark where everything could be rewritten. [379]
He had spent years interpreting cloud movements, but tonight they were not omens—they were collaborators. [402]

The mallet moved faster, dubbing the driftwood in quick, precise taps, each one sending a pulse through the water. [428]
The orchard swayed, the fruit trembling as if the trees themselves were keys. [446]
Leeward’s breath hitched as the resonance built, the air thickening with sound. [464]
He could feel the sea beneath him, vast and restless, but for once, it was not pulling him under. [488]

It was playing along. [492]
The clouds above shifted, their edges sharpening into the shape of a xylophone’s frame, the stars blinking like notes waiting to be struck. [523]
Leeward raised the mallet higher, then brought it down with a crack that split the silence. [545]
The sound exploded outward, a wave of euphony that sent the driftwood raft spinning in a slow, deliberate circle. [573]

The trees groaned, their roots stretching like strings, their branches arching toward the sky. [597]
Leeward laughed, the sound raw and wild, as the fractal patterns in the clouds began to glow, faintly at first, then brighter, as if the sky itself was resonating. [635]
He had turned the sea’s obstacles into instruments, and now the world was singing back. [657]

The blue hour deepened, the light bleeding into indigo, but Leeward did not stop. [675]
The mallet was an extension of his arm, the driftwood his stage, the sea his audience. [696]
He struck again, and the sound carried, not just across the water, but through it, through the salt and the sky and the restless heart of the world. [736]

The clouds swirled faster, their fractal edges sharpening into something like music made visible. [758]
Leeward’s chest ached with the beauty of it, the way the obstacles had become something so much greater. [785]
He had spent his life listening, but tonight, he was the one being heard. [805]
