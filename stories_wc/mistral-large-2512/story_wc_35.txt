The desert fortress stood jagged against the violet dusk, its adobe walls slick with the first rain in a decade. [16]
Chef Maren wiped her hands on her apron, the salt from the storm still stinging her fingertips. [33]
She could taste the rain’s memory—her mother’s laughter, the way it had echoed off the canyon walls before the drought swallowed everything. [61]
The fortress’s heavy doors groaned open, revealing the coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes, its frozen spires glinting under the dimming sky. [89]
It wasn’t supposed to exist here, this relic of a forgotten sea, but the desert had a way of preserving what it shouldn’t. [116]

Maren had come to subdue the fortress’s last guest, a man whose grief had seeped into the very stones. [139]
His name was Kael, and his sorrow was emotionally contagious through touch—one brush of his fingers, and she’d felt the weight of his daughter’s drowning, the way the tide had pulled her under like a hungry mouth. [175]
She flexed her hands, the phantom ache of that memory still clinging to her bones. [192]

The pavilion’s entrance was half-buried, the coral’s edges worn smooth by centuries of wind. [211]
Maren knelt, pressing her palm to the ground, analyzing tidal pool formations etched into the stone. [232]
The patterns told her where the water had once been, where it had retreated, leaving only the ghost of its shape. [255]
Kael had done the same, she realized—traced the absence of his daughter in the sand, over and over, until the desert had memorized his grief. [284]

She found him inside, curled against the pavilion’s frozen heart, his breath shallow. [300]
“You can’t stay here,” she said, her voice sturdy brittle, like the fortress’s walls. [318]
He didn’t look up. “It’s the only place that remembers her.” [330]
Maren crouched beside him, her knee brushing his sleeve. [342]
The contact sent a jolt through her—his stored remorse, thick as syrup, coating her tongue with the taste of salt and regret. [367]

She swallowed hard. “You’re not the only one who’s lost someone.” [378]
Kael’s eyes flickered, dark and hollow. “Then you know why I can’t leave.” [392]
Maren did know. [395]
She’d spent years sandpapering rough memories, smoothing the edges of her own grief until it was something she could carry without bleeding. [428]
But Kael had let his fester, let it grow teeth and claws. [443]

“Grief isn’t a monument,” she said. “It’s a tide. [453]
It comes, it goes. [458]
If you build your life around the low point, you’ll drown in it.” [474]
Kael’s fingers twitched. “What if I want to?” [482]

Maren reached for his hand, ignoring the way her skin prickled at the contact. [498]
His memories flooded her—his daughter’s laughter, the way she’d splashed in the shallows, the sudden silence when the current took her. [531]
Maren exhaled, letting the weight of it settle in her chest. [545]
She’d learned long ago that some pains couldn’t be sanded away, only carried. [563]

“You don’t have to forget,” she said. “But you can’t let it subsume you.” [580]
Kael’s breath hitched. “How?” [584]
Maren squeezed his hand. “By remembering her without drowning in it.” [599]
Outside, the rain had stopped, the desert drinking the last of the storm. [617]
The pavilion’s coral gleamed, its frozen edges catching the dying light. [633]

Kael stood, his movements slow, as if waking from a long sleep. [650]
Maren followed, her own memories lighter now, as if sharing his had diluted their weight. [674]
At the pavilion’s threshold, she turned back, pressing her palm to the coral one last time. [698]
The tidal formations pulsed under her fingers, warm for the first time in centuries. [717]

“It’s not a tomb,” she said. “It’s a promise.” [729]
Kael nodded, his eyes clear. [735]
They walked out together, the fortress’s walls standing sturdy brittle against the night. [753]
The desert stretched before them, vast and unyielding, but no longer alone. [769]
[772]
