The steam rose in lazy coils from the volcanic hot springs, carrying the scent of sulfur and damp earth. [14]
Mira knelt at the water’s edge, her gnarled fingers tracing the cracks in the obsidian rock, each one a map of time she had memorized. [39]
She was not supposed to be here—not anymore. [47]
The Reconstruction Council had declared the springs off-limits, a relic of the old world, too dangerous, too unpredictable. [66]
But Mira had never been one for rules, not when they were written by men who had never bent to till the soil or birth a child in the dark. [93]

Her granddaughter, Lina, had been the one to find the kite. [104]
It had snagged on the skeletal branches of a dead pine at the edge of the springs, its fabric torn but its tail intact, covered in symbols that made no sense. [132]
Lina had brought it to her, eyes wide with the kind of hope that only the young could still muster. [151]
"Grandmother," she had said, "I think it’s a message." [160]
Mira had taken the kite, turning it over in her hands, the symbols prickling at her skin like static. [177]
She didn’t tell Lina about the dreams—the ones where the trees whispered her name, where the vines curled around her ankles and pulled her toward the springs. [206]
She didn’t tell her that the plants had been speaking to her since she was a child, that she had learned to ignore them, to pretend she didn’t hear. [233]

The embryo in amber was nestled in the heart of the springs, suspended in the mineral-rich water like a secret waiting to be born. [255]
Mira had seen it years ago, during the last days of the old world, when the springs had still been a place of pilgrimage. [277]
The elders had called it a relic of the Before, a thing not meant for mortal hands. [293]
But Mira had always wondered. [297]
If the world had been remade in fire and ash, why had this single life been preserved? [318]
And why did the plants hum louder when she drew near to it? [331]

The symbols on the kite’s tail were the key. [339]
Mira spent three nights deciphering them, her fingers tracing the curves and lines until her vision blurred. [358]
The script was old, older than the Council’s histories, older than the ruins that dotted the hills. [374]
It spoke of a door, of a seal, of a destiny implanted in the earth itself. [389]
The words coiled around her thoughts like the steam from the springs, insistent, undeniable. [407]
She knew then what she had to do. [416]

The night she unsealed the embryo, the springs trembled. [427]
The water churned, dark and thick as blood, and the air smelled of lightning. [443]
Mira stood at the center of it, her hands pressed to the obsidian, her mind open to the whispers of the plants. [465]
They told her of roots stretching deep, of veins of heat and life, of a world that had been waiting for this moment. [491]
The embryo pulsed in its amber prison, and for the first time in decades, Mira felt no fear. [513]
Only purpose. [515]

Lina found her at dawn, curled beside the springs, her skin slick with mineral water, her breath slow and steady. [540]
The kite lay beside her, its symbols now faded, its message delivered. [555]
The embryo was gone, dissolved into the springs, its essence seeping into the earth. [571]
Lina knelt beside her, shaking her shoulder. [580]
"Grandmother," she said, "what have you done?" [588]

Mira opened her eyes. [592]
The plants were singing. [595]
Not in words, but in colors, in scents, in the way the air shimmered with possibility. [614]
She had spent her life bending tradition to her will, shaping it like clay, refusing to let it harden into dogma. [638]
But this—this was different. [643]
This was not just evolution. [648]
This was rebirth. [651]

She took Lina’s hand, pressing it to the warm, damp earth. [663]
"Feel that?" she said. [667]
Lina’s eyes widened. [670]
The ground hummed beneath her fingers, alive in a way it had never been before. [688]
Mira smiled. [691]
"Now we begin," she said. [696]

The Council would come, of course. [702]
They would call it heresy, sacrilege, a crime against the Reconstruction. [716]
But Mira had never been one for their laws. [726]
She had spent her life fighting, not for power, but for the right to choose what came next. [750]
And now, with the embryo’s destiny woven into the earth, she knew the world would have no choice but to listen. [779]
The springs steamed around them, the plants whispered, and the future unfolded like a kite catching the wind. [800]
