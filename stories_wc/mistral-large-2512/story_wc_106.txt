The last train of the evening hummed at the emerald station, its windows glowing like fireflies trapped in glass. [16]
Lira adjusted the strap of her leather satchel, her fingers brushing the cool surface of the jar nestled inside. [35]
It wasn’t just any jar—it held captured moonbeams, stolen from the sky on nights when the world felt too heavy to bear. [61]
She had taken them not for greed, but for the way they turned ordinary moments into something luminous, something worth remembering. [85]

A golden-hour portrait thief, they called her, though she preferred to think of herself as a curator of fleeting light. [110]
The station’s clock ticked closer to departure, its hands trembling like leaves in the wind. [128]
Lira had come here for a reason, one that pressed against her ribs like a secret too big for her chest: to press her ear against destiny’s door. [158]
She didn’t know what she’d hear on the other side, but she knew the jar in her bag was the key. [179]

Across the platform, a man in a tailored coat arranged flowers on a bench. [192]
Not just any flowers—each stem, each petal, was placed with deliberate precision, as if he were writing a letter only the universe could read. [220]
Lira had heard whispers of codes in flower arrangements, of messages hidden in the language of blooms. [238]
She stepped closer, her shadow stretching long and thin under the fleeting golden sunset. [256]

“You’re either a poet or a spy,” she said, her voice barely above the station’s murmur. [271]
The man glanced up, his eyes reflecting the last embers of daylight. [284]
“Both,” he admitted, “but mostly, I’m someone who believes in illuminated moments.” [302]
Lira’s breath hitched. [306]
She had spent years chasing those moments, stealing them from the edges of other people’s lives. [328]
But this man—he didn’t steal. [333]
He reinterpreted. [335]

The jar in her bag pulsed faintly, as if sensing the shift in the air. [350]
“What’s your name?” she asked. [356]
“Kael,” he said, tucking a sprig of lavender into the bouquet. [367]
“And what’s the code for ‘I think I’ve found what I’ve been looking for’?” [385]

Kael smiled, quietly savvy in a way that made her stomach flutter. [398]
He plucked a single white rose from the arrangement and held it out to her. [415]
“White for new beginnings,” he said. [422]
“And if you turn it upside down, the petals form a door.” [437]

Lira took the rose, her fingers trembling. [444]
The jar in her bag glowed brighter, its light spilling through the satchel’s seams. [461]
She understood then—destiny wasn’t something you eavesdropped on. [474]
It was something you built, petal by petal, beam by beam. [486]

The train’s whistle blew, sharp and insistent. [496]
Kael didn’t move. [500]
Neither did Lira. [503]
The world around them blurred into streaks of gold and green, the station’s emerald tiles shimmering like a dream. [530]
She reached into her bag and pulled out the jar, its contents swirling like liquid starlight. [550]

“What if we don’t get on?” she asked, her voice thick with luminous disbelief. [568]
Kael took the jar from her hands and held it up to the fading light. [584]
The moonbeams inside stretched and twisted, forming shapes—doors, keys, pathways. [601]
“Then we make our own track,” he said. [610]

Lira laughed, the sound ringing like a bell in the hush of the station. [627]
The train pulled away without them, its windows glowing like the jar in Kael’s hands. [647]
She took the white rose and pressed it to her chest, where her heart beat like a drum calling her forward. [670]

The sunset bled into twilight, painting the sky in hues of amber and violet. [688]
Lira and Kael stood there, two thieves of light, their shadows merging into one. [706]
The jar pulsed once more, its glow soft and steady, as if promising that the best moments were the ones you chose to illuminate. [738]

And for the first time, Lira didn’t feel like she was stealing anything. [753]
She was simply standing in the light, waiting for the next door to open. [769]
