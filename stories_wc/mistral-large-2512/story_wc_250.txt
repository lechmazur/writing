The cobalt dock glistened under the weight of recent rain, each plank slick with reflections of the bruised evening sky. [17]
No one came here—not fishermen, not lovers, not even the stray cats that usually prowled the wharves. [34]
Only the silent canal guardian, known to the few who whispered of her as *La Tessitrice*, sat cross-legged on the edge, her bare feet dangling above the water. [62]
She had been there since dusk, her fingers tracing the damp wood as if reading braille only she could understand. [85]

Her name was Maris, though no one had called her that in years. [98]
The townsfolk spoke of her in hushed tones, as if her silence were a contagion, something to be feared rather than revered. [122]
But Maris didn’t mind. [126]
Silence was her craft, her language, the way she wove the world into something softer, something that could hold secrets without breaking them. [153]

Tonight, her tools were simple: a dental mirror, its handle worn smooth from years of use, and the shutters of the abandoned boathouse behind her. [180]
She had spent the last hour creating patterns with them, angling the slats just so, letting the last of the daylight fracture into ribbons across the dock. [209]
The effect was mesmerizing—light and shadow dancing in spiralingly calm arcs, as if the air itself had been stitched together by an unseen hand. [240]

A child’s voice cut through the stillwater tension, sharp as a blade. [252]
"Mama says you’re a witch." [258]
Maris didn’t turn. [261]
The girl—no older than eight, her hair tangled from the rain—stood at the mouth of the dock, clutching a sodden doll. [284]
"You don’t talk," the girl said, stepping closer. [291]
Maris exhaled through her nose, a sound so quiet it might have been the wind. [307]
She held out the dental mirror, tilting it so the girl could see her own reflection, distorted slightly by the curve of the glass. [330]

The girl frowned. [332]
"Why do you have this?" [336]
Maris tapped the mirror once, then pointed to the girl’s mouth. [347]
The girl’s frown deepened, but she opened her lips, revealing a gap where a tooth had recently fallen out. [368]
Maris nodded, then gestured to the shutters, where the light had begun to dim. [384]
The girl followed her gaze, watching as the patterns shifted, the shadows stretching longer, swallowing the dock in patches. [411]

"You’re showing me the dark," the girl said. [420]
Maris didn’t answer. [423]
Instead, she reached into her pocket and pulled out a small, smooth stone—a river pebble, flecked with mica that caught the last of the light. [452]
She placed it in the girl’s palm, then closed her fingers around it. [465]
The girl’s breath hitched. [468]
In the mirror, Maris’s reflection smiled. [474]

This was her work: to teach darkness the value of stars. [484]
Not by speaking, not by force, but by weaving silence into understanding, by letting the quiet do the talking. [511]
The girl stared at the pebble, then at the shutters, where the last sliver of light had vanished, leaving only the faintest glow of the mica against her skin. [548]

"You’re not a witch," the girl whispered. [556]
Maris shook her head. [560]
The girl hesitated, then tucked the pebble into her pocket and ran back toward the town, her footsteps echoing like a half-spoken secret. [591]

Maris stayed where she was, the dental mirror now resting in her lap. [604]
The canal lapped gently against the dock, the sound a metronome to her thoughts. [620]
She had done this for years—waiting, watching, weaving. [631]
Some came to her out of curiosity, others out of fear, but all left with something they hadn’t known they needed. [656]

The night deepened, the cobalt of the dock fading into black. [669]
Maris picked up the mirror again, angling it toward the sky. [682]
Even in the dark, there were stars—faint, but unmistakable. [697]
She smiled. [700]
The world was full of things that needed teaching. [709]
And she would keep weaving, one silent pattern at a time. [723]
[725]
