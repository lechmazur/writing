The asteroid hung like a gilded relic in the void, its baroque spires twisting into the dark, each facet carved with the forgotten elegance of a dead empire. [23]
Elias Veyra stood in the grand hall of the Obsidian Archive, his fingers tracing the chipped edge of a crystal vase shard he had carried for decades. [50]
The shard was all that remained of the last revolution he had helped spark—a revolution that had burned too bright and left only ashes and this jagged sliver of beauty. [87]
Around him, the air hummed with the weight of time made visible, a phenomenon that had begun after the Great Unraveling, when the fabric of moments stretched thin enough to see the ghostly echoes of what had been and what might never be. [138]

The archaeological dispute had festered for years. [145]
Scholars from the Core Systems claimed the asteroid’s ruins were the remnants of a long-lost human colony, their theories backed by corporate funding and the cold precision of data. [177]
But Elias knew better. [180]
He had seen the truth in the way the light fractured through the shard, in the way the asteroid’s carvings whispered of a civilization that had not just lived, but dreamed in verse. [215]
The Core’s archaeologists called him a relic, a defunct revolutionary clinging to poetry in a world that had moved on to equations and efficiency. [243]
But Elias didn’t care. [246]
His motivation was simple: to reimagine that entire civilization, to prove that the people who had built this place had not just survived, but thrived in beauty, in meaning. [283]

The storm outside the archive’s windows was not of wind or rain, but of temporal distortions, the sky writhing with the visible threads of time. [311]
Elias moved through the hall, covering the mirrors with heavy velvet drapes, a ritual he had devised years ago after learning that the reflections in the glass could trap the unwary in loops of their own past. [355]
The Core’s team had laughed at him for it, but they didn’t understand. [372]
They didn’t see the way the mirrors could swallow a person whole, leaving only a hollow echo of what they had been. [396]

Dr. Liora Vex, the lead archaeologist from the Core, found him in the archive’s central chamber, where the ceiling arched like the ribs of some great beast. [428]
“You’re wasting your time, Veyra,” she said, her voice sharp as the shard in his hand. [446]
“This place isn’t poetry. It’s a puzzle. And we’re solving it.” [461]
Elias turned to her, the burnished sorrow in his chest aching like an old wound. [478]
“You’re not solving anything,” he said. [483]
“You’re erasing it.” [486]

He held up the shard, letting the light from the storm outside catch its edges. [502]
“This isn’t just a piece of a vase,” he said. [510]
“It’s a fragment of a story. [517]
A story they told themselves to make sense of the world. [530]
And you’re tearing it apart to fit it into your spreadsheets.” [544]

Liora’s expression darkened. [549]
“Sentiment won’t rebuild a civilization,” she snapped. [560]
Elias smiled, though there was no joy in it. [568]
“No,” he agreed. [570]
“But it might remind us why we should.” [579]

Outside, the storm raged, time itself bending and twisting in the void. [595]
Elias knew he was running out of it. [603]
The Core’s team would soon strip the asteroid bare, cataloging its secrets until there was nothing left but cold, hard facts. [630]
But he had one last plan. [636]

That night, as the storm reached its peak, Elias returned to the archive’s deepest chamber, where the walls were lined with mirrors that had not yet been covered. [670]
He placed the shard on the floor, positioning it carefully so that its fractured light would catch the reflections just right. [699]
Then he began to speak, his voice weaving through the chamber like a thread through fabric, each word a stitch in the tapestry of the past. [737]

The mirrors shimmered, their surfaces rippling as if touched by an unseen hand. [754]
And for the first time in centuries, the asteroid’s true story began to unfold—not in data, but in verse, in the poetry of a civilization that had dared to dream. [793]

Liora found him there at dawn, the storm finally spent, the mirrors now blank and still. [813]
Elias was slumped against the wall, the shard clutched in his hand, his breath shallow but his eyes alight with something she had never seen in him before: hope. [850]

“What did you do?” she whispered. [856]
Elias looked up at her, his voice barely more than a rasp. [867]
“I gave them back their voice,” he said. [875]
“And maybe, just maybe, I gave us back ours.” [889]
[890]
