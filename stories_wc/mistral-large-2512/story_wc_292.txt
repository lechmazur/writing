The weather station clung to the cliffside like a dying man to a ledge, its rusted girders groaning under the weight of the new sky. [19]
Mira adjusted her glasses, her fingers trembling—not from fear, but from the nervous confidence of someone who had spent years deciphering secrets no one else cared to read. [50]
She had come here for the journals, not the storms, though the two were now inseparable. [68]

The jet stream had shifted three winters ago, dragging the storms south in ways the old maps never predicted. [90]
The station’s generators hummed weakly, their power siphoned by the experimental turbines that had failed to tame the winds. [113]
Mira’s ancestor, Elias Voss, had been the station’s first meteorologist, and his name was scratched into the logbooks with the same precision he’d used to chart the unchartable. [143]
But no one remembered him for that. [150]
They remembered the mutiny, the exile, the way he’d vanished into the sea like a man erased. [169]

Mira had found the copper nail in his coffin—or what was left of it. [182]
The undertaker had pried it loose when the body was exhumed for reburial, and it had ended up in a box of "historical oddities" at the university. [207]
The nail was bent, its head flattened, as if it had been hammered in haste. [223]
She carried it in her pocket now, a tangible link to a man who’d been written out of history. [242]

The station’s archives were a maze of salt-warped shelves, the air thick with the scent of mildew and ozone. [262]
Mira ran her fingers along the spines of the journals, each one a relic of a time when the sky had still behaved. [284]
Elias’s handwriting was there, buried in the margins of later entries, coded in stanzas that read like poetry but mapped like coordinates. [310]
"When the wind turns its back on the land, seek the place where the gulls do not go," she murmured, tracing the words. [336]
The lines were reversible, she realized—read backward, they pointed to the station itself. [350]

Exile had been Elias’s punishment for refusing to falsify data, for insisting the storms were changing. [368]
But the mutineers hadn’t killed him. [375]
They’d marooned him on the very cliff where the station now stood, leaving him with a boat, a knife, and a single copper nail—perhaps as a mercy, perhaps as a joke. [409]
The nail had been meant for his coffin, but Elias had used it to repair the boat. [427]
He’d survived. [430]
And then, somehow, he’d returned. [436]

Mira’s breath hitched as she pieced it together. [446]
The reversible exile wasn’t just a punishment—it was a test. [456]
Elias had come back, not as a broken man, but as a ghost, haunting the station with his coded warnings. [478]
The journals were his confession, his proof, his way of ensuring someone would eventually question the official story. [502]

A gust rattled the windows, and the lights flickered. [513]
Mira’s hands shook as she turned the page, the nervous confidence draining into spongey dread. [533]
The last stanza was incomplete: "The nail holds the truth, but the truth is a—" [552]
She pulled the copper nail from her pocket, turning it over in the dim light. [567]
The flattened head wasn’t from a hammer. [574]
It was from a key. [578]

Behind her, the station’s old furnace rumbled to life, its door creaking open on its own. [597]
Mira didn’t question it. [602]
She stepped forward, the nail clutched in her fist, and slid it into the lock she’d never noticed before. [624]
The mechanism clicked, and the furnace’s false back swung aside, revealing a narrow passage. [645]
Inside, a single journal lay open, its pages filled with Elias’s final entries. [662]
He hadn’t just survived the exile. [669]
He’d mastered it. [673]

And now, Mira would have to decide whether to do the same. [686]
The storms were coming again, the jet stream twisting like a living thing. [703]
The station’s alarms wailed, but she barely heard them. [714]
She was too busy reading the last line, the one that changed everything: "Exile is reversible, but so is the sky." [740]
The nail had been the key all along—not just to the furnace, but to the truth. [760]
And the truth was that Elias hadn’t been exiled. [770]
He’d been sent. [774]

Mira closed the journal, her heart pounding. [783]
The station groaned around her, the wind howling like a thing betrayed. [799]
She had come to honor an ancestor’s bravery. [809]
But the real question was whether she was brave enough to finish what he’d started. [826]
