The sewer tunnels beneath the sunken city of Vorthas reeked of damp rot and old secrets, but Elias didn’t mind. [14]
He had chosen this place precisely for its stench—it kept the fools above from bothering him. [31]
A wannabe philosopher with ink-stained fingers and a mind sharper than the rusted blades of the city’s drowned past, he spent his days scribbling theories on waterlogged parchment, convinced that the answers to existence lay buried in the muck. [75]
The plague had ended decades ago, but its shadow lingered, not just in the bones piled in the catacombs, but in the way people refused to remember. [104]
They called it progress. [107]
Elias called it cowardice. [110]

His latest obsession was the seafarer’s chronometer cog he’d fished from the silt near the old harbor. [129]
It was a relic of the time before the city sank, when Vorthas had been a hub of trade and timekeeping, where sailors relied on such devices to navigate the treacherous straits. [161]
The cog was small, no larger than his palm, its brass teeth worn smooth by centuries of saltwater and sediment. [182]
But it was perfect. [185]
Not in the way engineers meant—its mechanism was long dead—but in the way it represented a lost method of understanding the world. [215]
The old sailors had measured time not just to mark its passage, but to predict the tides, the storms, the very rhythm of the sea. [243]
Elias turned the cog over in his fingers, tracing the grooves where the sediment had settled in layers, each one a story. [267]
If he could decipher them, he might uncover the competing narratives of the city’s fall: the official version, where the plague was an act of divine punishment, and the whispered one, where it was something far more deliberate. [311]

He had always been rationally rebellious—never content to accept the easy answer, always poking at the cracks in the world’s logic. [341]
It was why he lived in the sewer, why he hoarded broken things, why he agonized over every scrap of knowledge like a starving man over a crust of bread. [373]
The scholars above ground had their libraries, their clean hands, their carefully curated histories. [392]
But down here, in the dark, the truth was still raw, still fighting to be heard beneath the weight of centuries. [421]

Elias spread his notes across the damp stone, arranging them in concentric circles like the rings of a tree. [445]
The outer layers were the official records: the plague as a natural disaster, the city’s surrender to the sea as inevitable. [469]
But the inner layers—the ones closer to the cog’s core—told a different story. [487]
A story of sabotage, of merchants who had poisoned their rivals’ wells to control the spice trade, of priests who had turned a blind eye for a cut of the profits. [526]
The cog was the key. [531]
Its sedimentary layers were a timeline, each one a moment frozen in time, each one a lie waiting to be unraveled. [561]

He spent days hunched over a makeshift desk, his candle flickering in the draft, his fingers black with ink and grime. [590]
The more he learned, the more he realized how little the world above cared. [610]
They had moved on, built new cities on the bones of the old, rewritten history to suit their needs. [632]
But Elias couldn’t let it go. [639]
To preserve ancient methods wasn’t just about nostalgia—it was about holding the powerful to account, about refusing to let the past be smoothed over like a stone in the tide. [680]

One evening, as the distant echo of footsteps above sent rats scurrying into the shadows, Elias made his decision. [707]
He would take his findings to the surface. [716]
Not to the scholars—they would only bury them deeper—but to the dockworkers, the fishermen, the ones who still lived by the rhythms of the sea. [750]
They would understand. [753]
They had to. [756]

He packed his notes into a waterproof satchel, the cog tucked safely in his pocket. [775]
The sewer’s exit was a crumbling archway, half-submerged in brackish water. [792]
Elias took a deep breath and stepped into the unknown. [803]
