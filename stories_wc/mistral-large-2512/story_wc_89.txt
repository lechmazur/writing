The orchard hummed under a silver moon that never set, its gnarled branches heavy with fruit that glowed like embers. [18]
Liora crouched among the roots, her fingers brushing the bark of an ancient apple tree, its scent thick with the memory of cinnamon and clove. [46]
She had come here after the phoenix rose, its ashes still warm on the wind, because this was where he had last spoken to her—not in words, but in the language of beasts. [89]

The fortune from her last meal at the village tavern had read: *What was lost will return, but not as you knew it.* [118]
She had crumpled the slip of paper, then smoothed it out again, pressing it into her pocket like a talisman. [141]
Now, as she exhaled into the orchard’s perfumed air, she understood. [153]

Liora was a beast whisperer, though she had never chosen the title. [166]
It had chosen her, the way the orchard chose which blossoms to bear and which to let wither. [185]
Her gift was paradoxically steady—calm in the face of chaos, unshaken by the snarls of wolves or the keening of dying stags. [213]
But tonight, her hands trembled. [220]

She had come to conjure him. [225]
Not as he was—a man of flesh and laughter—but as something else, something that could slip between the cracks of death. [252]
The method was written in the orchard’s breath: via the scent of rare spices, the kind that lingered in the phoenix’s pyre. [278]
She gathered them now—saffron threads, crushed cardamom, a pinch of star anise—murmuring the old words as she ground them into a paste. [307]

The first time she had done this, she had been a child, calling a wounded fox from the brambles. [330]
The second time, she had summoned a storm to drown a forest fire. [343]
But this—this was different. [348]
This was a reluctant metamorphosis, a reshaping of love into something that could endure beyond the grave. [372]

The paste sizzled in her palm, smoke curling into the shape of wings. [385]
A shadow detached from the trunk of the apple tree, solidifying into the outline of a man. [406]
His edges flickered, like a candle flame in the wind. [419]
"Liora," he said, and his voice was the crackle of embers. [431]

She reached for him, but her fingers passed through his chest. [443]
"You’re not real," she whispered. [449]
"Not yet," he agreed. [454]
"But I will be." [460]

The orchard rustled around them, the trees leaning in as if to listen. [474]
Liora’s throat tightened. [479]
She had spent years speaking to creatures who could not answer back, but this—this was a bond beyond death, a love that refused to unravel. [512]
The phoenix had risen, and with it, the rules of the world had bent. [533]

"You’ll have to let me go," he said, his form wavering. [547]
"Not as I was. Not as you remember." [557]
She nodded, tears cutting silver paths down her cheeks. [569]

The spices in her palm flared, and the air filled with the scent of burning cedar. [589]
His shape twisted, feathers bursting from his skin, his bones elongating into the curve of wings. [614]
The metamorphosis was reluctant, painful, but she did not look away. [631]
When it was done, a great bird perched before her, its eyes still his—dark, knowing, alive. [657]

Liora pressed her forehead to its breast. [666]
The bond was reforged, not as it had been, but as it needed to be. [684]
The orchard sighed in approval, its branches swaying like dancers in the permanent moonlight. [707]

She would learn to speak to this new creature, just as she had learned to speak to the others. [729]
But for now, she simply held on, steady in the paradox of loss and return. [749]

The phoenix had risen, and so had he. [760]
The fortune had been right. [766]
What was lost had returned, but not as she knew it. [781]
And that, she realized, was enough. [790]
