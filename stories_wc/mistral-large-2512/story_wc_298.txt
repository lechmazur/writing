The catacomb orchard stretched beneath the city like a forgotten lung, its gnarled roots threading through ribs and skulls, drinking deep from the marrow of the dead. [23]
Liora crouched between two twisted trunks, her fingers brushing the bark as if it might whisper secrets back. [42]
She had come here not for answers, but to bargain—her reckless idealism a flame that refused to gutter, even in the damp chill of the half-lit corridors. [76]

A burned tarot card lay in her palm, its edges curled like scorched petals. [91]
The Tower, reduced to ash and memory. [97]
She had drawn it the night her brother vanished, the night the city’s elite sealed the catacombs and called it mercy. [123]
Now, she meant to trammel fate itself, to force the orchard’s roots to yield what they had taken. [145]

The air smelled of wet earth and old rot, the kind of decay that clung to the back of the throat. [167]
Liora exhaled, her breath fogging in the dusky resolve of the underground. [182]
She had spent weeks inlaying meaning everywhere—carving sigils into the bark, pressing coins into the hollows of eye sockets, murmuring promises to the bones. [213]
If the orchard was a ledger of lives, she would rewrite the entry for her brother’s name. [232]

A rustle came from the shadows. [240]
Not wind—too deliberate. [243]
Liora tensed, her fiercely gentle hands curling into fists. [256]
She had not come here to fight, but she would not flinch from it either. [273]

A figure stepped into the dim glow, their cloak woven from moth wings and threadbare patience. [294]
"You’re the one they call the Patchwork Girl," the stranger said, voice like dry leaves skittering. [316]
Liora didn’t deny it. [321]
The name had followed her since she began stitching scraps of cloth over the holes in her soul, a desperate kind of mending. [351]

"I know what you want," the stranger continued, holding out a skeletal hand. [369]
In their palm lay a single seed, black as a void. [380]
"Bartered destinies are the only ones that grow here." [393]

Liora’s pulse quickened. [397]
She had heard the stories—how the orchard fed on bargains, how it gave only what it took. [424]
But her brother’s face flickered behind her eyes, his laughter echoing in the hollows of her chest. [449]
She reached for the seed. [455]

The stranger’s fingers closed around hers, their grip surprisingly warm. [470]
"Not so fast," they murmured. [476]
"The orchard demands a price for its gifts." [489]
Liora swallowed. [493]
"What do you want?" [498]

"A memory," the stranger said. [503]
"Not just any memory. The one that keeps you awake at night." [523]
Liora’s breath hitched. [527]
She knew the one—the moment she had hesitated, the moment her brother’s hand slipped from hers as the guards dragged him into the dark. [562]

She could still feel the phantom weight of his fingers, the way his voice had cracked as he begged her to run. [592]
But if she gave it up, she would forget the sound of his voice, the shape of his smile. [618]
The hole in her soul would widen, even as she patched it with someone else’s thread. [642]

The stranger waited, patient as the roots coiling around bones. [657]
Liora closed her eyes. [662]
The orchard’s breath was thick with the scent of bartered lives, of destinies twisted into something new. [687]
She had come here to trammel fate, but perhaps the real bargain was learning to live with the cracks. [717]

She opened her palm. [723]
The burned tarot card crumbled to dust. [732]
"Take it," she whispered. [737]

The stranger smiled, their teeth too white in the dim light. [753]
The seed vanished into the earth, and the roots trembled, as if remembering something long forgotten. [783]
Liora didn’t look back as she walked away, her steps lighter, her soul heavier. [809]
Some holes couldn’t be patched—they could only be carried. [823]
