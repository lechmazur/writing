The potter knelt in the cracked earth, fingers brushing the dry clay as if it were a sleeping child. [13]
His name was Ren, though no one had called him that in years—not since the last village crumbled into dust. [30]
The abandoned beekeeping oasis stretched around him, a skeletal orchard of withered lavender and the hollow husks of hives, their wax long since melted into the sand. [61]
Ren had come here because the place refused to die, though the world had tried its best. [80]

His hands moved without thought, shaping a bowl from the clay, its curves mimicking the dips of the land. [100]
The faded lantern glass sat beside him, its once-vibrant blue now bleached by the sun, the cracks within it catching the light like veins. [126]
Ren had found it years ago, half-buried in the ruins of a caravan, and though he didn’t know why, he had carried it ever since. [151]
It thrummed sometimes, a quiet vibration against his palm, as if it held a heartbeat. [169]

He had learned to follow the sun’s patterns long before the wasteland claimed everything. [187]
Back when he was still a boy, his master had taught him to read the way light bent through water, how shadows stretched like fingers pointing toward hidden things. [220]
Now, he used those same lessons to track the oasis’s stubborn life. [236]
The bees were gone, but their ghosts lingered in the way the wind hummed through the empty hives, in the way the lavender still bloomed, though no one tended it. [267]

Ren was phototropic to kindness, though he would never have put it that way. [283]
He was drawn to the places where life persisted, where the world bent but did not break. [304]
This oasis was one such place. [311]
He had seen others—pockets of green in the gray, stubborn as weeds—but none had held his attention like this. [335]
Perhaps it was the lantern glass, its fractures catching the light in ways that made him think of time, of how it splintered and doubled back on itself. [363]

As chimney smoke flattens into the sky, so too did the edges of this place blur. [380]
Ren had seen it happen before: the way the air shimmered just beyond the oasis, the way the sand shifted like water when he wasn’t looking. [411]
He had heard stories of fractured timelines, of places where time looped or stretched or folded in on itself. [438]
This oasis, he suspected, was one of them. [450]

He set the bowl down and picked up the lantern glass, turning it in his hands. [467]
The cracks within it seemed to shift, just slightly, as if they were breathing. [484]
He had seen this before, too—in the way the lavender bloomed out of season, in the way the wind carried the scent of honey though no bees remained. [518]
The oasis was resisting change, but not in the way he had expected. [536]
It wasn’t holding on. It was remembering. [546]

Ren stood, the clay bowl cradled in his palms. [558]
He walked toward the center of the oasis, where the oldest hive stood, its wood bleached white by the sun. [582]
The air here was thicker, warmer, as if the past were pressing against the present. [603]
He set the bowl down at the base of the hive, then lit a small fire in the rusted brazier beside it. [628]
The smoke curled upward, flattening as it met the sky, just as the stories said it would. [650]

The lantern glass thrummed again, louder this time. [662]
Ren closed his eyes and listened. [670]
He could hear it—the hum of bees, the rustle of leaves, the distant laughter of people who had been gone for decades. [700]
The oasis was not resisting change. It was holding onto every version of itself at once. [724]

He understood then why he had been drawn here. [736]
It wasn’t just the kindness of the place, its stubborn refusal to fade. [753]
It was the fractures. [757]
The way time bent and broke, the way the past and present tangled together like roots beneath the sand. [785]
Ren opened his eyes. [790]
The lantern glass was whole again, its blue vibrant, the cracks gone. [805]
The bowl he had made was filled with honey. [815]
