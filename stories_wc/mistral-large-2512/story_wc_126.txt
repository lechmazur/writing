The sunken orchard greenhouse had once been a jewel of glass and iron, now half-buried in silt and seaweed, its arched ribs like the ribs of the shipwrecks that ringed it like silent sentinels. [23]
Liora tuned her violin with slow, deliberate fingers, the strings humming in response to the damp air, each note a whisper against the chronic hush that had settled over the world after the rainforest burned. [58]
She had come here not for the fruit—long since rotted away—but for the way sound moved through the greenhouse’s skeletal remains, bouncing off the curved glass, amplifying even the faintest vibration. [95]
As an echo-harbor violinist, she was acoustically perceptive, attuned to the way music could unbind memories trapped in the silence. [122]

Her mendicant’s bowl, chipped and stained, sat beside her on the moss-slick stone, a relic of her grandmother’s time, when the bowl had been passed among storytellers who gathered around bonfires to weave tales of the old world. [160]
Liora had never known those fires, but she had inherited the bowl, and with it, the weight of a family tradition that demanded she find beauty in the unfinished, in the broken, in the spaces between notes. [198]
The greenhouse was perfect for that. [203]

She played a scale, the sound spiraling upward, then fading into the waterlogged air. [220]
A fish darted past the submerged panes, its scales catching the dim light like scattered coins. [238]
Liora smiled. [240]
This was why she had come: to coax music from a place that had forgotten how to sing. [260]

The shipwrecks beyond the greenhouse creaked in the current, their hulls groaning like old men remembering wars. [283]
She had heard the stories—how the rainforest’s burning had sent rivers of ash into the sea, how the ships had fled the smoke only to founder on the reefs, how the greenhouse had sunk under the weight of the deluge that followed. [330]
No one lived here now, not even the mendicants who had once wandered the coasts, begging for stories instead of coin. [356]
But Liora had come anyway, because she believed in the unfinished. [372]

She lifted her bow and began to play. [378]
The melody was simple, a lullaby her mother had sung before the fires took her voice. [399]
The notes curled around the greenhouse’s ribs, lingering where the glass was still intact, then spilling out into the open water. [428]
A school of silver fish paused, their bodies shimmering in the current. [443]
Liora played louder, the sound vibrating through the soles of her feet, through the stone, through the bones of the earth itself. [472]

Then she heard it—the echo. [477]
Not a true echo, but something else, something that answered. [491]
A low, resonant hum, like a string being plucked deep beneath the waves. [512]
Her breath caught. [515]
She had heard stories of the shipwrecks singing when the tide was right, of the greenhouse’s glass humming with the voices of the drowned. [552]

Liora set down her violin and picked up the mendicant’s bowl. [565]
She dipped it into the water, filling it halfway, then held it to her ear. [582]
The hum was clearer now, a melody without words, a story without an end. [602]
She smiled. [604]
This was the beauty she had come to find—not in the finished, but in the fragments, in the way the world still tried to speak even when it had been silenced. [648]

She played again, this time improvising, letting the greenhouse’s acoustics guide her. [668]
The hum rose in response, weaving between her notes like a second voice. [687]
The fish circled closer, their movements synchronized with the music. [702]
Liora closed her eyes and let the sound carry her. [713]

When she finally lowered her bow, the greenhouse was quiet again, but the hush felt different now—less like absence, more like anticipation. [745]
She packed her violin and bowl, her fingers lingering on the chipped rim of the mendicant’s vessel. [767]
The stories would continue, she knew, even if no one was left to tell them. [787]
All she had to do was listen. [794]
