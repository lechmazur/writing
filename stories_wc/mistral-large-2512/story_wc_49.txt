The arbor stretched like a cathedral of leaves, its emerald arches trembling in the first breath of dawn. [13]
Liora crouched between the gnarled roots, her fingers brushing the damp earth as if coaxing secrets from it. [31]
She was a whimsical tinkerer, her pockets always stuffed with half-finished trinkets—clockwork beetles, glass prisms that fractured light into rainbows, and a tiny silver flute she swore could summon fireflies. [68]
But today, her tools lay forgotten beside her, overshadowed by the vine tendril coiled around her wrist like a living bracelet. [94]
It had sprouted overnight, its leaves still furled tight as a newborn’s fist, pulsing faintly with the same rhythm as her heartbeat. [124]

The harvest moon had risen three nights prior, swollen and gold, and with it, the old stories whispered that the world would tilt just enough for miracles. [156]
Liora had spent years spinning golden stories of her own—tales of lost magic, of forgotten gods who once danced in these very woods—but no one listened anymore. [189]
The villagers called her *the Dreamer Who Forgets to Eat*, and maybe they were right. [205]
Yet when the tendril had slithered through her window, winding around her arm like a question, she knew this was no accident. [230]

She had come to the arbor at dawn because the elders said this was where the first song was sung. [252]
The air here was thick with the scent of crushed mint and something older, something like the echo of a lullaby. [275]
Liora pressed her palm to the bark of the oldest tree, its surface etched with spirals that matched the markings on the tendril. [301]
"Alright," she murmured, "what do you need?" [310]

The tendril tightened, just slightly, as if in answer. [321]
She remembered then the stories her grandmother had told—of the sacred practices, the ones that kept the land in balance. [346]
The villagers had stopped singing the old songs, stopped leaving offerings at the roots, stopped believing that the earth listened. [369]
But the tendril was proof: the earth had not forgotten. [380]
It had sent her a remedy, a thread to pull until the world righted itself. [398]

Liora closed her eyes and hummed the first notes of *The Weaver’s Lament*, a song so old its lyrics had crumbled into nonsense. [427]
The tendril shivered, its leaves unfurling like tiny green hands. [442]
She sang louder, her voice cracking on the high notes, but it didn’t matter—the arbor was listening. [464]
The wind stilled, the birds hushed, and for a breath, the world held its silence like a held note. [488]

Then, the tendril pulsed again, and Liora felt it: a warmth spreading from her wrist to her chest, as if the song had found its way home. [520]
The spirals on the tree’s bark began to glow, faintly at first, then brighter, until the entire arbor was bathed in golden light. [550]
She laughed, giddy and breathless, because she understood now—this was the moment when everything aligns. [577]

The villagers would come soon, drawn by the light, and she would tell them the story of the tendril, of the songs, of the harvest moon’s promise. [607]
They would scoff at first, but the arbor would hum with the echoes of her voice, and the tendrils would creep toward them, too, winding around their wrists like gentle reminders. [646]
And maybe, just maybe, they would sing along. [658]

Liora plucked a leaf from the tendril and tucked it into her pocket, a keepsake of the dawn when the world remembered. [684]
The golden light faded, but the arbor’s hush remained, deeper now, as if it had been waiting for this all along. [712]
She took a deep breath, the scent of mint and memory filling her lungs, and began to walk back toward the village. [739]
The first notes of the next song already trembling on her lips. [752]
