The first time Elias Voss saw his own death certificate, he was standing in the fluorescent glow of a port authority office, the paper trembling in his hands like a leaf caught in a storm. [25]
The date was correct—October 12, 2018—but the name was wrong: *Elias Voss* had been scratched out, replaced with *Daniel Mercer*, a man who had drowned in the harbor three days prior. [58]
The clerk had shrugged, as if such errors were as common as rust on the shipping containers that loomed outside, stacked twenty high in a jagged labyrinth of steel and salt. [92]

Elias didn’t correct her. [96]
Instead, he pocketed the certificate and walked into the maze, where the air smelled of diesel and low tide. [117]
The containers were a city unto themselves, their walls layered with graffiti—some fresh, some faded into the metal like ghosts. [140]
He had come here for the same reason he had come to every port city since the error: to find the seams where reality frayed. [164]
Because if the world could misplace a life as easily as a shipping manifest, then maybe other things had been misplaced too—memories, names, entire histories. [190]

He carried a label from a poison bottle in his coat pocket, its edges worn smooth from handling. [210]
It was the only thing he had left of his mother, though he couldn’t remember her face. [229]
The label read *Forget-Me-Not Elixir*, a name that had always struck him as cruelly ironic. [248]
He didn’t know if she had taken it herself or if someone had given it to her, but the bottle had been empty when he found it, and the label was all that remained. [278]

Elias had learned to filter reality differently after the death certificate. [293]
Where others saw rust and cargo, he saw layers—each container a vessel for stories half-remembered, half-erased. [317]
He collected fragments of overheard conversations like a magpie, stitching them together in his notebook. [336]
A dockworker’s lament about a wife who vanished into the fog. [349]
A sailor’s joke about a ship that never arrived. [360]
A child’s rhyme about a man who walked into the water and came back wrong. [379]

The tides dictated his rhythm. [386]
At high tide, the maze felt like a cathedral, the water lapping at the lower containers, turning them into islands. [410]
At low tide, the mudflats revealed things that didn’t belong—a shoe, a rusted key, a waterlogged book with its pages fused together. [440]
Elias would crouch in the muck, prying at the book’s spine, as if the words might still be legible beneath the salt. [465]

He was searching for the texture of memories. [475]
Not the clean, polished kind found in photo albums, but the rough, frayed edges of things half-remembered. [499]
The way his mother’s voice had sounded when she sang, though he couldn’t recall the song. [519]
The shape of his father’s hands, though he couldn’t remember if they had been rough or soft. [540]

One evening, as the tide crept in, Elias found a woman sitting on a container’s edge, her legs dangling over the water. [568]
She was humming the same tune his mother had sung, though she couldn’t have known it. [590]
When he asked her name, she only smiled and said, *Names are just labels we outgrow.* [612]
He showed her the poison bottle label, and she traced the letters with her fingertip. [632]
*Forget-Me-Not,* she murmured. *How poetic.* [644]

She told him she had been collecting stories too, though hers were written on the walls of the containers. [670]
Some were in ink, some in blood, some in languages that no longer existed. [690]
She had been trying to piece together a history that had been erased, just like his. [712]
Elias realized then that he wasn’t alone in his search. [726]

The next morning, he woke to find her gone, but the container where she had sat was no longer blank. [750]
Scratched into the metal were two words: *Daniel Mercer.* [767]
Elias touched the letters, his fingers trembling. [778]
The tide was coming in, and for the first time, he didn’t feel the need to run from it. [799]
Maybe some histories weren’t meant to be found—only layered, like the containers themselves, one story atop another, until the truth became something new. [835]
