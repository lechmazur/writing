The exiled chess tutor, Elias Veyne, had not touched a board in seven years. [12]
His fingers, once precise as a metronome, now fidgeted productively—twisting a silver ring around his thumb, plucking at the frayed hem of his coat, anything to keep from stillness. [38]
The village of Harkensleep lay frozen in time, its cobblestones dusted with the same breath of frost that had settled the night he arrived. [63]
Distant thunder rumbled, not a storm’s fury but the lull of some celestial engine grinding beyond the horizon, a sound that made the air hum like a plucked harp string. [96]

Elias had come to Harkensleep for the platinum labyrinth. [104]
Not the one beneath the village square, though that was the one the villagers whispered about—the one that shifted its corridors like a living thing, swallowing the unwary. [130]
No, his labyrinth was smaller, more intimate: a pocket-sized maze of polished metal, its walls etched with grooves too fine for human eyes. [156]
He had stolen it from the Duke of Veldros the night he fled, not out of greed, but because the labyrinth was the only thing that remembered his mistakes as vividly as he did. [188]

The woven hush of the village was its most unnerving trait. [198]
No wind stirred the thatch, no dogs barked, no children laughed. [210]
The villagers moved in silence, their lips sealed as if by some unspoken vow, their eyes reflecting the same hollow resignation. [233]
Elias had learned to mimic their stillness, but his mind never quieted. [246]
It was in the hush that the past spoke loudest. [255]

He winnowed his memories like chaff from grain, sifting for the moment he might forgive himself. [269]
The tapestry in the village hall offered a method. [278]
Its border was a tangle of frayed threads, each one a different color, each one snagged or knotted as if someone had tried to unravel it in haste. [308]
Elias spent his evenings decoding them, tracing the paths of the threads with his fingertips, following their logic as he once had the logic of a chess game. [339]
The first thread led to a name: *Liora*. [347]
The second to a date: the night of the Duke’s masquerade. [358]
The third to a move: the queen’s sacrifice he had advised, the one that lost the game and Liora her life. [382]

The villagers watched him, though they pretended not to. [392]
They knew what he was doing. [398]
Harkensleep was a place for those who couldn’t let go. [409]
The platinum labyrinth in his pocket grew warm when he touched the tapestry, as if it, too, was listening. [431]

One evening, as the distant thunder swelled into a low, mournful drone, Elias found the last thread. [455]
It was black, unlike the others, and when he pulled it, the tapestry’s edge unraveled with a sound like a held breath released. [482]
Behind it was a mirror, not of glass, but of polished platinum, its surface rippling like water. [504]
The labyrinth in his pocket hummed in response. [513]

He stepped through. [517]
The mirror was a door, and the door led to a memory: the night of the masquerade, the Duke’s grand hall lit by a thousand candles, Liora’s hand in his as they danced. [551]
But this time, the scene played differently. [559]
The Duke’s men did not drag her away. [566]
The queen on the chessboard did not fall. [572]
Elias saw himself as he might have been—steady, unbroken, a man who had not betrayed his student for the sake of a title. [600]

The woven hush of the memory was thicker than the village’s, a silence so deep it pressed against his eardrums. [623]
He reached out, not to touch Liora, but to touch the chessboard, to trace the move he should have made. [647]
The platinum labyrinth in his pocket burned hot enough to sear his skin, and the threads of the tapestry, now loose, coiled around his wrists like vines. [682]

“You don’t get to change it,” a voice said. [691]
It was Liora’s, but not as he remembered—older, weary, her mask gone, her face lined with the same regret that gnawed at him. [721]
“You only get to forgive yourself.” [729]

The memory shattered. [733]
Elias stood again in the village hall, the tapestry whole, the threads reknitted. [748]
The platinum labyrinth in his pocket was cool now, its weight lighter. [763]
Outside, the distant thunder stilled, and for the first time in seven years, Elias Veyne did not fidget. [785]
He exhaled, and the woven hush of Harkensleep exhaled with him. [799]
