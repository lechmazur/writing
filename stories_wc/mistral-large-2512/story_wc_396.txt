The lighthouse orchard stood sentinel above the shifting ice floes, its gnarled apple trees clawing at the frigid air like skeletal fingers. [19]
Elias Veyne, the shadow-laced peacekeeper, adjusted the frayed cuffs of his coat as he stepped between the frost-laced branches, his breath curling in the weighted silence before reply. [51]
He had come here not by choice, but by necessity—his intuition, calmly intuitive, had guided him to this place where time seemed to thicken like molasses. [86]
In his palm rested a broken crystal ball fragment, its jagged edges catching the pale moonlight like a shattered promise. [114]

The fragment had been given to him by a dying seer in the ruins of Veythar, its last words a whisper: *"Reconstitute what was lost, or the ice will claim us all."* [149]
Elias didn’t understand how a sliver of glass could mend anything, but he trusted the anomaly of his own courage—the way it flared in him when others faltered. [184]
That courage had saved lives before, though never his own. [198]

The lighthouse loomed ahead, its beam cutting through the dark like a blade. [216]
Inside, the air smelled of salt and old paper, the walls lined with vintage store mirrors—each one clouded with age, their reflections warped and fleeting. [245]
Elias had heard the stories: these mirrors didn’t show the present, but glimpses of what could be, if only one dared to look. [274]
He pressed the crystal fragment to the nearest mirror, and the glass rippled like water. [294]

A face appeared—not his own, but a child’s, eyes wide with terror. [311]
*"They’re coming,"* the reflection whispered. [320]
Elias’s pulse steadied. He had seen this before: the ice floes below were not just shifting, but *moving*, carrying something vast and hungry beneath their surface. [355]
The child’s fear wasn’t for herself, but for the village beyond the orchard, where the peacekeeper’s absence had left them vulnerable. [384]

His motivation crystallized: to map empathy onto action, to turn the seer’s cryptic warning into something real. [411]
He turned to the next mirror, and this time, the reflection showed the ice splitting open, revealing rows of jagged teeth. [440]
The shadows clinging to Elias’s coat writhed, sensing the threat. [455]
He had always been a bridge between light and dark, but now he needed to be more—a shield. [478]

The crystal fragment grew warm in his grip. [487]
He pressed it to another mirror, and the glass shimmered, revealing a path through the orchard, one that hadn’t existed moments before. [519]
The trees bent aside as if guided by unseen hands, their branches forming a corridor toward the village. [548]
Elias didn’t hesitate. [553]

As he ran, the ice groaned beneath him, the floes grinding together like teeth. [575]
The child’s reflection flickered in his mind, her voice now urgent: *"Hurry."* [590]
He reached the village just as the first creature breached the surface—a monstrous thing of ice and sinew, its maw gaping wide. [621]
The villagers screamed, but Elias stood firm, the crystal fragment glowing in his hand. [645]

He didn’t know if it would work, but he had to try. [658]
Closing his eyes, he let his intuition guide him, calmly intuitive, and hurled the fragment into the beast’s open mouth. [686]
The crystal shattered, and for a heartbeat, nothing happened. [702]
Then the ice *screamed*. [707]

The creature convulsed, its form unraveling like thread pulled too tight. [727]
The villagers watched in stunned silence as the beast dissolved into mist, the ice floes settling back into stillness. [755]
Elias exhaled, his shadows receding like a tide. [767]

The child’s reflection appeared one last time in the nearest mirror, smiling. [784]
*"You reconstituted the light,"* she said. [793]
Elias didn’t know what that meant, but the weight in his chest lifted. [810]
The lighthouse beam swept over him, warm and steady, as if the world itself had taken a breath before reply. [838]
[840]
