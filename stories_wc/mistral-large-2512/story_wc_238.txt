The sheet music archive smelled of yellowed paper and old glue, a scent Elias Voss knew better than his own reflection. [14]
He adjusted his wire-rimmed glasses, the lenses fogging slightly from the damp that seeped through the stone walls of the converted chapel. [34]
The gossip-column exorcist—once a feared name in the tabloids, now a whisper in the margins—hadn’t set foot here in twenty years. [59]
Not since the night he’d failed to save Clara Delvaux, the violinist whose hands had moved faster than his prayers. [80]

The archive’s curator, a gaunt man with ink-stained fingers, led him past shelves of crumbling scores, their spines cracked like dried leaves. [102]
“They’re felling the orchard at dawn,” the curator said, voice low as if the trees might overhear. [119]
Elias didn’t need the reminder. [124]
The hush before the orchard’s trees were cut down had settled over the town like a held breath, thick with the scent of apples left to rot. [147]
He’d come to reconnect, though he wasn’t sure with what—Clara’s ghost, his own guilt, or the part of himself that had believed in miracles. [171]

On a table in the archive’s heart sat an antique perfume bottle, its glass clouded with age, the stopper shaped like a weeping angel. [193]
Elias reached for it without thinking, his fingers brushing the cool surface. [206]
“That belonged to her,” the curator said. [213]
“She kept it in her case, next to her bow.” [222]
The bottle was empty, but when Elias uncorked it, the faintest trace of bergamot and something sharper—like lightning—lingered in the air. [246]

He’d first met Clara in this very room, when she’d been a prodigy with a temper and a habit of playing pieces backward to “hear the ghosts.” [268]
She’d laughed at his metaphors, the way he’d described exorcism as “tuning a radio to the right frequency.” [286]
“You don’t banish spirits,” she’d said, plucking a string on her violin. [297]
“You let them finish their song.” [304]

The night she died, he’d been too late. [312]
The entity possessing her—a thing of static and spite—had already snapped her spine like a bow over a knee. [332]
Elias had done what he could, but miracles were never perfect. [344]
They left scars, or absences, or worse: the hollow where something should have been. [359]

Now, standing in the archive’s dim light, he realized he’d never apologized. [371]
Not to Clara, not to her memory, not to the part of him that still flinched at the sound of a violin. [390]
The curator had left him alone, the door clicking shut with finality. [403]

Elias placed the perfume bottle on the table and rolled up his sleeves. [416]
He’d brought copper wire and a small induction coil, the tools of his trade, though he no longer advertised his services. [435]
Through induced currents, he could nudge the veil between worlds, coaxing whispers from the static. [452]
He wound the wire around the bottle’s neck, humming a tune Clara had once played—a waltz that sounded like falling. [473]

The air thickened, the way it did before a storm. [483]
The perfume bottle trembled, then glowed faintly, like a firefly trapped in glass. [499]
Elias closed his eyes and spoke, not in prayers, but in metaphors, the way he always had. [518]
“Grief is a river,” he said. [524]
“You can dam it, but it will find another way.” [536]
The bottle’s glow pulsed, and for a moment, he thought he heard the scratch of a bow against strings. [555]

Then, nothing. [557]
The light faded, the air stilled. [563]
Elias exhaled, his breath shaky. [571]
Had he failed again? [575]

But then—soft, so soft he almost missed it—a note hung in the air, pure and trembling. [594]
It wasn’t Clara’s playing. [599]
It was his own voice, years younger, saying, “I’m sorry.” [610]

The perfume bottle cracked, a single hairline fracture running from the angel’s wing to the base. [629]
A drop of amber liquid welled up, then fell, sizzling as it hit the copper wire. [647]
The scent of bergamot and lightning filled the room, stronger now, almost alive. [664]

Elias didn’t move. [667]
He let the moment stretch, let the weight of it settle. [680]
Outside, the first light of dawn crept through the stained-glass windows, painting the archive in hues of gold and blood. [703]
The orchard’s trees would fall soon. [711]
But for now, in this imperfect miracle, he’d said what he needed to say. [728]

The note faded, leaving only silence. [735]
Elias uncorked the bottle one last time and pressed it to his lips, not to drink, but to breathe. [753]
Then he placed it back on the table, beside the copper wire, beside the ghost of a song. [771]

The curator found him there an hour later, still sitting in the half-light. [785]
“Did it work?” the man asked. [792]
Elias smiled, tired but lighter. [798]
“Miracles aren’t about fixing,” he said. [806]
“They’re about listening.” [812]

The chainsaws started as he stepped outside. [819]
The first tree groaned, then fell. [825]
Elias didn’t look back. [829]
