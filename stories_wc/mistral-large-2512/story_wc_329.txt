The enchanted orchard stretched beneath the sky-bridge like a forgotten dream, its gnarled trees heavy with fruit that never rotted. [18]
Liora played her violin there, fingers dancing over the strings with a resonantly soft touch that made the air hum like a half-remembered lullaby. [44]
She had been the sky-bridge’s violinist for seven years, her music the only thing keeping the living statues from marching forward to uproot the orchard entirely. [78]
They stood motionless at the edges of the grove, their stone eyes fixed on her, waiting for the moment her song faltered. [104]

That morning, Liora found a locust shell resting on the bridge’s railing, its iridescent husk catching the light like a shattered prism. [130]
She picked it up, turning it over in her palm, and felt the faintest vibration—a heartbeat, not her own. [152]
It was signaling through heart rhythms, a language older than the statues, older than the orchard itself. [172]
She pressed the shell to her chest and closed her eyes, listening. [183]

The gap between knowing and understanding had always been her prison. [195]
She knew the statues would destroy the orchard if she stopped playing, knew the world beyond the bridge was a mechanical wasteland of gears and silence. [225]
But she didn’t understand why beauty still mattered in a place that had forgotten how to feel. [245]

A statue’s foot shifted in the dirt. [253]
Liora’s breath hitched, but she didn’t stop playing. [264]
The locust shell pulsed again, stronger this time, and she realized it wasn’t just a relic—it was a key. [286]
If she could mimic its rhythm, she might break free from the cycle that bound her to the bridge. [311]

She adjusted her bow, letting the music swell into something wild and untamed. [330]
The statues twitched, their stone faces cracking as vines erupted from the earth and coiled around their legs. [356]
Liora didn’t wait to see if they’d break free. [368]
She ran, the locust shell clutched in her fist, her violin case bouncing against her back. [387]

The orchard blurred around her as she sprinted toward the edge of the sky-bridge, where the mechanical world waited. [415]
She had spent years trying to reawaken beauty in a place that had buried it, but now she saw the truth: beauty wasn’t something to be coaxed back—it was something to be seized. [457]

The first statue lunged, its arm outstretched, but Liora leapt onto the railing and vaulted into the open air. [482]
For a heartbeat, she was weightless, the wind rushing past her ears. [499]
Then she landed hard on the other side, the impact jarring her bones. [518]

The mechanical world was worse than she’d imagined—towers of rusted metal, streets paved with broken glass, the air thick with the scent of oil and decay. [554]
But there, in the distance, was a flicker of movement: a child, no older than ten, pressing her ear to a cracked speaker. [583]
When she saw Liora, her eyes widened. [594]

“You’re real,” the girl whispered. [601]
Liora smiled, her fingers already tightening around her bow. [613]
“So are you,” she said, and began to play. [622]

The music spilled into the street, resonantly soft at first, then growing louder, richer. [641]
The child’s face lit up as the speaker crackled to life, vibrating with the same rhythm as the locust shell. [666]
Around them, the mechanical world shuddered—gears stuttered, lights flickered—and for the first time in decades, something beautiful stirred in the ruins. [702]

Liora didn’t know what would happen next. [711]
She didn’t need to. [715]
The gap between knowing and understanding had finally closed. [727]
She was free. [730]

The statues would keep coming, the mechanical world would resist, but she had already won. [751]
Because beauty wasn’t just something to be remembered—it was something to be fought for. [773]
And she would fight. [778]

The child reached out, her small hand brushing Liora’s sleeve. [793]
“Play again,” she begged. [800]
Liora nodded, lifting her violin once more. [809]
The music began anew. [813]
