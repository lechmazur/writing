The lighthouse on Blackthorn Isle had stood for a century, its beam cutting through the fog like a metronome counting time no one else could hear. [23]
Elias Voss had taken the job as keeper three months ago, not for the solitude, but because the previous keeper had left behind a fortune cookie slip tucked into the logbook. [56]
It read: *"The note you seek is hidden where the light bends."* [68]
Elias had laughed at first—fortune cookies were his father’s domain, not his—but the words clung to him like salt on the island’s rocks. [96]

His father, Linus Voss, had been the cryptic fortune cookie writer for *Golden Dragon*, a Chinatown takeout joint that doubled as a dead-drop for half the city’s intelligence agencies. [129]
Linus never explained how he knew what to write, only that the messages found their way to the right hands, like seeds carried by the wind. [156]
Elias had spent his childhood watching spies and diplomats fish slips of paper from their walnut shrimp, their faces unreadable as they palmed the microdot film specs Linus had hidden inside the cookies. [193]
*"Open secrets,"* Linus would say, stirring his tea. *"The best kind."* [206]

Now, Elias was beginning to understand. [212]
The lighthouse logbook mentioned a storm in 1987, the night the previous keeper had vanished. [231]
The entry was vague, but the next page held a smudge of grease—like the kind left by a fortune cookie—and beneath it, a single word: *"Transpose."* [261]
Elias’s breath caught. [264]
That was his father’s favorite word, the one he used when he talked about reshaping a life, like music shifted into a new key. [293]

After last orders at the island’s only pub, Elias rowed back to the lighthouse, the oars dipping into black water. [318]
The beam above him swept the horizon, but his mind was on the microdot specs, the way they’d been hidden in plain sight, waiting for someone to notice. [351]
He climbed the spiral stairs, his fingers tracing the walls where the light bent—where the beam refracted through the Fresnel lens and pooled in a perfect circle on the far wall. [386]
There, beneath a loose stone, he found a waterlogged envelope. [399]
Inside was a single microdot, no larger than a grain of sand. [413]

Back in the keeper’s quarters, Elias heated a cup of water over the stove and pressed the microdot between two glass slides. [441]
The specs unfurled like a flower, revealing a photograph: his father, younger, standing beside a man Elias didn’t recognize. [469]
The background was the *Golden Dragon*’s kitchen, but the date stamp was from the week Linus had "retired" to a fishing village in Maine. [498]
Elias’s hands shook. [502]
His father had never fished a day in his life. [511]

The next morning, Elias woke to the sound of an engine. [525]
A boat was approaching, its hull low in the water. [539]
He grabbed the binoculars and saw a woman in a black peacoat, her hair pulled into a tight bun. [561]
She moved like someone who knew the island’s rocks, stepping sure-footed onto the shore. [583]
Elias met her at the base of the lighthouse, the wind whipping his coat. [599]
*"You’re not supposed to be here,"* he said. [610]

*"Neither are you,"* she replied, holding up a fortune cookie slip. *"‘The past is a melody waiting to be replayed.’"* [637]
Elias’s stomach dropped. [641]
That was one of Linus’s. [646]
*"Who are you?"* he asked. [652]

*"Someone who needs what your father left behind,"* she said. *"The specs. The originals."* [673]
Elias realized then that the microdot wasn’t the only one. [686]
His father had orchestrated this, directing the flow of information like a conductor, ensuring the right people found the right secrets at the right time. [720]
And Elias had played his part perfectly. [729]

*"Why now?"* he asked. [734]

*"Because the song’s changing,"* she said. *"And your father’s the only one who knew the new key."* [759]
Elias looked at the lighthouse beam, how it bent and refracted, how it turned darkness into something navigable. [785]
He thought of Linus, who had spent his life transposing chaos into order, hiding truth in plain sight. [810]
*"Then let’s play it,"* Elias said. [817]
