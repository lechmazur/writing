The workshop groaned like a dying beast, its iron bones creaking as the acid sea below licked at its rusted underbelly. [19]
Inside, Elias the cart glider—so named for his habit of launching himself off cliffs in jury-rigged contraptions—adjusted the brass gears of his latest obsession: a bell no one had ever heard, nor ever would. [59]
It wasn’t about the sound, he told himself, though the lie tasted like copper in his mouth. [80]
It was about the *yearning algorithm* etched into the bell’s core, a pattern of cogs and wires designed to translate longing into motion, motion into resonance, resonance into something like meaning. [119]
Elias had found the schematics in a waterlogged journal, its pages fused into a single, pulpy mass that he’d painstakingly *transliterated* through the flickering images in a kaleidoscope, twisting the lens until the symbols bled into sense. [163]
The workshop’s owner, a grizzled woman named Veyra, had warned him against it. [176]
“That bell’s a fool’s errand,” she’d said, spitting into a bucket of acid that hissed in response. [194]
“Fools ring bells,” Elias had replied, grinning. [202]
But Veyra wasn’t wrong. [206]
The workshop floated on an acid sea because the world had long since dissolved into something both beautiful and corrosive, a place where gears turned not out of necessity, but out of sheer, *steadily curious* defiance. [250]
Elias had been born into this defiance, his parents cart gliders before him, their bodies broken on the rocks below when their wings failed. [279]
He’d survived by clinging to the workshop’s hull, his fingers raw from the acid, his mind alight with the same restless energy that now drove him to ring a bell no one would hear. [324]

The arrow tip was a relic, really—hunter’s steel, its edge notched from some ancient battle, its purpose long forgotten. [352]
Elias had found it embedded in the workshop’s wall, where it had lodged itself during a storm years before. [375]
He kept it in his pocket like a talisman, running his thumb over its cold surface whenever the workshop’s groans grew too loud. [405]
Tonight, the groans were deafening. [412]
The acid sea was rising, its fumes curling through the cracks in the floorboards, and the workshop’s gears were grinding to a halt, one by one. [450]
Elias knew what that meant. [456]
The workshop was dying. [460]
And with it, his chance to ring the bell. [471]

He worked faster, his hands moving with the precision of a man who had spent *throughout the evolution* of his life learning the language of gears. [505]
The bell was nearly complete, its copper surface etched with the same symbols he’d deciphered in the kaleidoscope, their meaning still just out of reach. [542]
Veyra watched him from the shadows, her face unreadable. [557]
“You’re wasting your time,” she said. [565]
Elias didn’t look up. [569]
“Maybe,” he admitted. [573]
“But what’s the point of a bell if no one hears it?” [589]
“The point,” Elias said, “is that someone *might*.” [602]
He fitted the final gear into place, the arrow tip’s edge scraping against the metal as he adjusted it. [630]
The bell hummed, a low, resonant note that vibrated through the workshop’s bones. [652]
Elias held his breath. [657]
Then, he pulled the cord. [663]

The sound was nothing like he’d imagined. [673]
It wasn’t a peal, nor a chime, but a deep, shuddering groan, like the workshop itself had found its voice. [707]
The acid sea stilled. [712]
The gears stopped turning. [718]
For a moment, there was silence. [725]
Then, from somewhere beyond the workshop’s walls, an echo returned—not a sound, but a *feeling*, a vibration in the air that made Elias’s teeth ache. [769]
Veyra’s eyes widened. [775]
“What in the hells was that?” she breathed. [788]
Elias smiled. [792]
“I think,” he said, “it heard us.” [803]
