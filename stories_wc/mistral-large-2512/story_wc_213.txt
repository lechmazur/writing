The windblown sanctuary of Veythari perched on the spine of the world, where the clouds coiled like sleeping serpents below. [17]
Here, the air was thin and sharp, carrying the scent of ozone and old stone. [29]
Liora knelt on the cold flagstones, her fingers tracing the grain of the cathedral bell rope where it pooled beside her. [50]
She had been the storm siren tester for seven years, though no one called her that to her face—just "the listener" or, less kindly, "the girl who waits for nothing." [80]

The rope was frayed at the edges, its fibers stiff after the glue dried. [94]
She had mended it herself, weaving in strands of copper wire to strengthen the weak points. [110]
It was a poor substitute for the original hemp, but the cathedral’s funds had long since run dry, and Liora had learned to make do. [133]
The bell itself hung silent above her, its bronze surface dull with neglect. [148]
It had not rung in decades, not since the last storm siren had failed to wake it. [166]

Liora was credibly curious about why. [173]
Not in the way of scholars, who dissected storms with equations and instruments, but in the way of someone who had spent her life listening to the sky’s whispers. [198]
She had tracked microclimate variations for years, noting how the wind shifted before a tempest, how the clouds thickened in patterns only visible from this height. [228]
The sanctuary’s records were full of her observations, scribbled in margins and on scraps of parchment. [242]

But today was different. [246]
Today was zero hour. [250]
The storm that had been building for weeks was finally upon them, its leading edge a wall of black advancing across the horizon. [276]
Liora had felt it in her bones for days—the way the air hummed, the way the birds fell silent. [296]
She had come to the sanctuary at dawn, as she always did, but this time she carried a secret. [316]

She had made a switch. [321]
Not a grand one, not a betrayal, but a quiet act of defiance. [336]
The old storm siren, a relic of brass and gears, had been replaced with a newer model, one that responded to the cathedral’s bell. [358]
The priests had installed it without telling her, assuming she would never notice. [372]
But Liora had noticed. [375]
And she had swapped the wires. [380]

Now, the siren would only sound if she pulled the rope. [391]
It was a small rebellion, but it was hers. [399]
The priests favored noise over listening, blaring warnings at the first sign of trouble, sending villagers scrambling for cover when often the storm would pass harmlessly by. [434]
Liora believed in waiting, in hearing the storm’s true voice before deciding. [451]

The wind howled against the sanctuary’s walls, rattling the stained-glass windows. [465]
Liora stood, gripping the rope. [472]
The storm was close now, its breath cold on her face. [484]
She closed her eyes and listened. [491]

Not to the wind, but to the silence beneath it. [500]
To the way the air stilled before the lightning struck. [511]
To the rhythm of the rain as it began to fall, soft at first, then harder. [529]
She had learned to hear the difference between a storm that would rage and one that would weep. [550]

This one was weeping. [555]
Liora exhaled, her shoulders relaxing. [562]
The villagers would be safe. [567]
She let the rope slip from her fingers. [574]

Then she heard it—a crack like the world splitting open. [588]
Her eyes flew open. [592]
The storm had changed its mind. [598]
The wind screamed, and the clouds churned, and the lightning split the sky in two. [618]

Liora grabbed the rope and pulled. [625]
The bell tolled once, deep and resonant, and the storm siren wailed to life. [642]
The villagers would hear it now, would know to take shelter. [656]
She had been wrong, but she had been listening. [666]

The sanctuary trembled as the storm broke over it, the rain lashing the stones like a thousand whips. [689]
Liora knelt again, her hands pressed to the flagstones, feeling the vibrations of the bell through her bones. [713]
She had favored listening over noise, and it had nearly cost her everything. [730]
But she would not stop. [735]

The storm would pass. [740]
And when it did, she would listen again. [748]
[750]
