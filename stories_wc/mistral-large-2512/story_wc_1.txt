The canyon walls hummed with the weight of silence, their shadows stretching long under the indifferent gaze of the stars. [17]
Liora knelt by the creek, her fingers brushing the cold water, the glass beads around her neck catching the faintest glimmer of moonlight. [42]
She had been a luminous glass artist once, her hands shaping light into vessels that held stories no one else could see. [73]
Now, her studio lay in ruins, the kiln reduced to a blackened husk, and the only thing left intact was the ledger strip she had found tucked beneath a loose floorboard. [112]

The charcoal smuggler’s ledger strip was no wider than her thumb, its edges frayed from years of being folded and unfolded. [140]
It bore no names, only numbers—quantities of fuel, routes carved into the canyon’s veins, deliveries made under cover of night. [169]
She traced the ink with her fingertip, the patterns as familiar as the scars on her wrists, left from the attempt she had barely survived. [198]
The fire had come for her that night, not for her work, but for what she knew. [219]

Liora had always been steadily adaptive, bending like the reeds along the creek when the wind howled, but never breaking. [246]
This was different. [248]
This was the kind of change that left ash in its wake, a scorched testament to what had been and what could never be again. [280]
She had spent the weeks since the fire retracing her steps, not to reclaim what was lost, but to understand why it had been taken. [311]

The canyon was quiet tonight, the kind of quiet that settled into your bones and made you listen for things that weren’t there. [343]
Liora followed the creek upstream, her boots crunching over frost-kissed stones, the patterns in the morning frost guiding her like a map. [374]
She had noticed them weeks ago—delicate, repeating shapes where the ice clung to the rocks, as if the earth itself was leaving clues. [406]
At first, she thought it was coincidence, but the more she walked, the more the patterns aligned with the routes on the ledger strip. [438]

A shadow moved ahead, too large to be an animal. [452]
Liora froze, her breath curling in the cold air. [464]
The figure turned, and she recognized the hunch of his shoulders, the way his hands never quite stilled. [490]
It was Jaren, the smuggler who had once slipped her extra charcoal for her kiln, no questions asked. [517]
He had been there the night of the fire, his face a mask of something between guilt and fear. [543]

"You shouldn’t be here," he said, his voice rough as gravel. [559]
"I need to know why," she replied, holding up the ledger strip. [575]
Jaren’s eyes flicked to it, then away, as if the paper itself might burn him. [595]
"That’s not yours," he muttered. [602]

"It is now," she said. [607]
The wind picked up, carrying the scent of smoke and damp earth. [624]
Liora had spent her life shaping beauty from chaos, but now she was searching for purpose in the pauses—the moments between breath, between heartbeats, between what was and what could be. [665]
Jaren exhaled sharply, his shoulders slumping. [678]
"They were going to burn the whole canyon," he admitted. [693]
"Not just your studio. Everything." [702]

The words settled over her like the frost on the rocks, cold and inevitable. [721]
She had thought the fire was an end, but it was only the beginning of something else. [743]
Liora looked down at the ledger strip, the numbers now a language she understood. [763]
The canyon had always been a path, but tonight, it was also a choice. [782]
She folded the strip carefully and tucked it into her pocket, the weight of it steady against her thigh. [800]
