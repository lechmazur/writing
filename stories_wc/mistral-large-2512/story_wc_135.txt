The ivory harbor glistened under a sky still heavy with rain, its pale docks slick with the residue of the storm. [18]
Liora Veyne adjusted the strap of her satchel, the weight of damp parchment pressing against her ribs as she stepped over a puddle reflecting the fractured light of the harbor lanterns. [49]
As the ocean-spray archivist, her duty was to collect what the waves left behind—not just shells and seaweed, but the echoes of stories half-drowned in salt and time. [87]

The exile had ended only a fortnight prior, and the city hummed with the restless energy of those who had returned to find their homes changed, their memories unreliable. [126]
Liora had spent years in the coastal archives of the northern isles, transcribing the testimonies of fishermen and smugglers, but now she was back, and the fragments she had gathered felt heavier than ever. [166]
Her motivation was simple: to compile them into meaning, to stitch together the absences that gaped like missing teeth in the city’s history. [197]

A gust of wind sent a spray of seawater across her face, and she tasted salt on her lips. [217]
She wiped her brow, her fingers brushing the herald’s trumpet valve tucked into her belt—a relic from the old regime, its brass surface tarnished but still humming with the faintest resonance. [255]
It had been given to her by an old sailor who claimed it had once called the exiles home, though no one alive remembered the sound. [288]

Liora was reactively visionary; she saw patterns where others saw only noise. [306]
The valve, for instance, wasn’t just a curiosity—it was a key. [320]
If she could find the rest of the trumpet, she might uncover the truth behind the exile’s end, the reason the city’s rulers had suddenly lifted the banishment after decades of silence. [358]

She turned down a narrow alley where the cobblestones were still dark with rain, the air thick with the scent of wet stone and distant cooking fires. [390]
A figure leaned against the wall, his cloak damp at the hem. [406]
"You’re late," he said, pushing off the wall. [414]
It was Dain, a former scribe who had been exiled alongside her. [428]
He had spent the years since then smuggling contraband texts, and now he carried a bundle wrapped in oilcloth. [457]

"Did you find it?" Liora asked, her voice low. [466]
Dain nodded, unwrapping the cloth to reveal a second valve, its engravings worn but identical to hers. [489]
"Third one’s in the old watchtower," he said. [502]
"Guarded?" [504]
"By a man who owes me a favor." [514]

Liora exhaled, her breath visible in the cool air. [526]
This was how they would hearten the city—not with grand speeches, but through staggered intervals, small revelations that built toward something greater. [558]
The valves, once reunited, would sound the truth, and the people would remember what had been erased. [584]

They moved quickly, sticking to the shadows as they crossed the harbor. [600]
The watchtower loomed ahead, its ivory stones pale even in the dim light. [618]
Dain knocked twice, paused, then knocked again—their signal. [632]
The door creaked open, and a grizzled face peered out. [645]
"Took you long enough," the man grumbled, stepping aside. [658]

Inside, the air was thick with the scent of lamp oil and old paper. [672]
The third valve sat on a table, its brass surface catching the light. [688]
Liora reached for it, her fingers trembling. [699]
When all three were laid out before her, she saw the full design: a map, etched into the metal, of the harbor as it had been before the exile. [742]

Dain leaned in, his breath warm against her ear. [752]
"They didn’t just send us away," he murmured. [761]
"They erased us." [765]

Liora closed her eyes, the weight of the valves heavy in her hands. [780]
The city’s absences had been navigated, one fragment at a time. [795]
Now, they would sound the truth. [802]
