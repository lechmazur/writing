The icebound spire loomed above the clouds, its jagged silhouette cutting through the wrongness of the sky—a swirling void where stars should have been. [21]
Lirien the Swift, a chivalrous thief with a reputation for leaving noblemen lighter in coin but heavier in pride, adjusted the straps of her stolen satchel as she climbed the frost-slicked steps. [54]
She had come for the pocket sundial lid, a relic said to hold the last true measure of time before the sky had fractured. [81]
But she wasn’t here for greed; she was here for wonder. [91]

Her mentor, the Apprentice of Wonder—a title as much as a name—had once told her that the unknown was not to be feared, but embraced with open arms. [124]
Lirien had taken those words to heart, though she amended them slightly: embrace the unknown, but do it while running. [146]
The spire’s entrance yawned before her, a mouth of black ice and whispering winds. [161]

Inside, the air hummed with a sacredly playful energy, as if the very walls were laughing at some cosmic joke. [183]
Lirien’s breath fogged in the frigid air as she crept forward, her fingers brushing the carved chess pieces tucked into her belt. [208]
Each piece was hollow, a secret vessel for truths too dangerous to speak aloud. [227]
She had spent months swapping them in taverns and markets, trading lies for truths, never staying long enough to be caught. [253]

A flicker of movement caught her eye—a shadow where no light should cast one. [270]
Lirien froze, her pulse quickening. [276]
The spire’s guardian was no mere beast, but something older, something that had watched the sky break and decided to play along. [308]
She had heard the stories: the guardian collected secrets like chess pieces, and it always won. [330]

Lirien reached into her satchel and withdrew the first carved pawn. [344]
Inside was a secret she had stolen from a dying scholar: the coordinates of a lost city beneath the ice. [365]
She placed it on the floor and stepped back, her breath shallow. [378]
The shadow twitched, then solidified into a figure woven from frost and starlight. [397]

“A trade,” Lirien said, her voice steady despite the thrum of her heartbeat. [413]
The guardian tilted its head, its eyes like chips of the wrong sky. [430]
“A secret for a secret,” it murmured, its voice the sound of cracking ice. [448]
Lirien nodded and placed another piece—a rook containing the name of a traitor who had sold the last sundial lid to the highest bidder. [485]

The guardian’s fingers, long and translucent, plucked the rook from the ground. [502]
“Clever thief,” it said, “but not clever enough.” [514]
Lirien’s stomach dropped. [520]
She had miscalculated. [523]

The guardian reached into its own cloak and withdrew the pocket sundial lid, its surface etched with constellations that no longer existed. [556]
“Take it,” it said, “but know this: time is not what you seek. It is what seeks you.” [585]
Lirien hesitated, then took the lid, her fingers trembling. [600]
The guardian dissolved into mist, its laughter echoing through the spire. [616]

She had won. [620]
But as she turned to leave, the lid grew warm in her palm, and the wrong sky outside pulsed like a living thing. [649]
Lirien realized then that the guardian had given her exactly what she wanted: not an object, but a question. [680]
What did it mean to embrace the unknown when the unknown was already embracing you? [704]

She tucked the lid into her satchel and began the long climb down, her steps lighter than they had been on the way up. [734]
The wind howled around her, but for the first time, it didn’t sound like a warning. [756]
It sounded like an invitation. [762]

Lirien grinned, her breath curling in the cold. [772]
She had come for a relic, but she was leaving with something far greater: the thrill of the next secret, the next wonder, the next wrong sky to explore. [813]
