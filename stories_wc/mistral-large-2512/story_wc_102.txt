The viaduct arched over the river like a spine of stone, its iron ribs draped in wisteria that bloomed violet even as twilight bled into the water below. [23]
Lien adjusted the brass lens of her camera obscura, the device’s wooden body warm against her palms, its single eye drinking in the fading light. [49]
She had come here not to capture images, but to chase a memory—one that had surfaced last night like a drowned thing rising from the river’s depths. [84]
In it, she had been someone else: a woman with ink-stained fingers, pressing a jade tear into the palm of a grieving stranger. [114]
The tear had not been hers to give, yet she had given it anyway. [129]
Now, in this life, Lien carried the same weight in her chest—a love she had never spent, a tenderness that had nowhere to go. [158]

She exhaled, watching her breath curl into the cool air, and for a moment, the fog around her thickened, as if responding. [186]
The method had come to her in fragments: revealing through breathing changes. [199]
Not just the act of breathing, but the way it altered the world around her—how a sigh could part the mist, how a gasp could make the wisteria tremble. [234]
She had spent years studying the unseen, the way light bent and souls flickered, but this was different. [256]
This was not observation. This was communion. [264]

A pilgrim of sparks, that’s what the old texts called those who walked the edge of memory and fire. [286]
Lien had never thought of herself as one, but now she understood. [299]
The sparks were not in the air—they were in her. [311]
Every breath she took was a spark, and every spark was a question: *Where does unused love go?* [335]

She knelt on the viaduct’s damp stones, pressing her forehead to the cold metal of the camera obscura. [358]
The device hummed, its lens reflecting not the world outside, but the one within. [374]
There, in the inverted image, she saw herself as she had been in the past life: kneeling before a woman whose face was a mask of sorrow, offering Kwan Yin’s tear—a single drop of jade, said to hold the goddess’s compassion. [422]
The memory was not hers, yet it fit like a key in a lock. [439]

Lien’s fingers trembled as she reached into her coat pocket, where the tear rested against her skin. [462]
She had found it years ago in a market stall, its surface cool and smooth, as if it had been waiting for her. [486]
Now, she understood why. [492]

A sound cut through the fog—a cough, then footsteps. [503]
A man emerged from the mist, his face gaunt, his eyes hollow. [517]
He carried a child in his arms, the boy’s limbs limp, his breath shallow. [533]
Lien’s chest tightened. She knew that look—the look of a father who had tried everything, who had nothing left but the weight of his own love, unused and aching. [570]

“Please,” the man whispered, his voice raw. [580]
Lien didn’t hesitate. [583]
She pressed Kwan Yin’s tear into his palm and closed his fingers around it. [599]
“Breathe,” she said. [603]
The man inhaled, sharp and shuddering, and the fog around them swirled, revealing the path ahead—not just for him, but for her. [637]
The tear glowed faintly, its light seeping into the child’s skin. [652]
The boy stirred, his eyelids fluttering open. [662]

Lien watched as the man’s breath steadied, as the weight in his shoulders eased. [683]
She had healed them, but not in the way she expected. [696]
She had not fixed the boy’s body—she had shown the father where his love had been stored all along: in the act of giving it away. [730]

The memory of the past life settled into her like a second heartbeat. [746]
She had been a pilgrim then, too, carrying sparks in her hands, offering them to those who needed light. [771]
Now, she understood. [774]
The place where unused love was stored was not a vault or a temple—it was in the hands of others, waiting to be passed on. [807]
