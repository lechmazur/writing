The mist curled like smoke through the open windows of Elias’s workshop, carrying the scent of damp earth and pine. [18]
He knelt beside the injured chameleon, its emerald scales dull under the pale glow of the oil lamp, and exhaled slowly. [40]
The creature had lost the very tip of its tail—no more than a sliver of flesh, but enough to leave it vulnerable, its camouflage incomplete. [71]

Elias had always believed in the quiet strength of gentleness, in the way a wounded animal could trust a steady hand. [98]
But trust was a fragile thing, especially now, after the con had been revealed. [117]
The man who’d claimed to be a fellow conservationist, who’d charmed Elias with stories of rare species and shared ideals, had turned out to be a poacher. [148]
Worse, he’d used Elias’s own research to locate the chameleons, luring them into traps with the same patience Elias had once admired. [179]

The workshop was his sanctuary, a place of shimmering stillness where the outside world’s betrayals couldn’t reach. [205]
Shelves lined with jars of preserved specimens—moth wings, snake skins, the delicate bones of birds—cast long shadows across the wooden floor. [229]
Above, the stars blinked through the glass roof, their light quietly vivid against the dark. [248]

He reached for the small dish of adhesive, his fingers trembling just slightly. [263]
Reconstructing the chameleon’s tail would take time, but he had nothing but time now. [282]
The poacher was gone, vanished into the night with his stolen prizes, and Elias was left with the wreckage of his convictions. [311]
He’d believed in the goodness of people, in the idea that kindness could bridge even the widest divides. [338]
Now, that belief felt as delicate as the chameleon’s broken tail. [355]

The creature shifted under his touch, its eyes swiveling independently, watching him. [372]
Elias smiled, though the expression didn’t reach his eyes. [385]
“You don’t know how lucky you are,” he murmured. [397]
“You only lost a piece of yourself. I lost the whole illusion.” [419]

He dipped a fine brush into the adhesive, then paused. [434]
The tail tip was gone, but perhaps the chameleon could adapt, could grow something new in its place. [461]
Maybe that was the answer—not to cling to what was broken, but to shed the layers of what no longer served. [493]

Elias set the brush down and instead picked up a pair of tweezers. [511]
He’d been too soft, too willing to see the best in people. [529]
That wasn’t a flaw, not exactly, but it had left him exposed. [547]
Now, he needed to balance self-respect with compassion, to protect what mattered without losing himself in the process. [579]

The chameleon flicked its tongue, tasting the air. [591]
Elias carefully trimmed the ragged edge of the tail, smoothing it into something cleaner, stronger. [614]
It wouldn’t be perfect, but it would be enough. [627]

Outside, the mist thickened, wrapping the workshop in a cocoon of quiet. [645]
Elias worked in silence, the only sound the occasional rustle of the chameleon’s scales against the wooden table. [673]
He thought of the poacher, of the way the man had smiled as he lied. [692]
Anger flickered in his chest, but he let it pass, like a breath. [711]

When he was done, the chameleon’s tail was shorter, but whole. [728]
Elias placed it gently back into its enclosure, where it immediately began to change color, blending into the bark of a small branch. [758]
He watched it for a long moment, then turned back to his workbench. [777]

The jars on the shelves seemed to watch him, their contents suspended in time. [795]
Elias picked up a notebook, its pages filled with sketches and observations. [812]
He flipped to a blank page and began to write, his hand steady. [829]
The words came slowly at first, then faster, as if shedding layers of doubt with every stroke. [855]
