The atrium’s glass ceiling dripped with twilight, each raindrop a whisper against the mist-clad panes. [14]
Lena adjusted the volume on her earpiece, the decades-old hearing aid crackling like static from another era. [34]
She wasn’t supposed to be here—not as a contact tracer for hearts, not at this hour, not when the dead called. [57]
But the last photograph in her pocket burned against her thigh, its edges softened by time and too many folds. [79]

It showed a woman in a floral dress, standing in this very atrium thirty years ago, her smile fragile as the mist outside. [107]
The woman’s name was Miriam, and she’d been the first to vanish when the voices started. [126]
Not the kind of voices that haunted the living, but the ones that slipped through the cracks of memory, begging to be heard. [152]
Lena’s job was to listen. [157]

She traced her fingers along the atrium’s marble rail, the cold seeping into her bones. [175]
The building had once been a hospital, then a sanctuary for those who heard too much. [193]
Now, it was just another place where the past refused to stay buried. [209]
Her earpiece buzzed—a faint pulse, like a heartbeat buried under layers of dust. [229]

Lena knelt, pressing her palm to the floor. [239]
The hearing aid wasn’t meant for this, but she’d learned to coax meaning from its static. [257]
A name, half-swallowed by time: *"Elias."* [265]
She’d heard it before, in the files of the forgotten, the ones who’d answered the dead’s calls and never returned. [292]

Her breath hitched as the pulse grew stronger, syncing with the rhythm of her own heartbeat. [313]
The atrium darkened, the mist thickening into something almost solid. [330]
She wasn’t brave—just persistently curious, the kind of curiosity that had gotten her into this mess in the first place. [356]
But Miriam’s photograph was still in her pocket, and if Lena didn’t find her, no one would. [378]

A shadow moved near the atrium’s center, where the old fountain had once bubbled. [397]
The figure was translucent, a man in a nurse’s uniform, his edges flickering like a dying bulb. [423]
*"You shouldn’t be here,"* he said, his voice a rasp of static. [440]
Lena swallowed hard. *"Neither should you."* [450]

The man—Elias—tilted his head, as if listening to something beyond her. [467]
*"They’re coming for the new ones,"* he whispered. *"The ones who hear too much."* [487]
Lena’s fingers tightened around the photograph. [497]
Her job wasn’t just to trace the living; it was to protect vulnerable voices, even the ones that had already slipped away. [529]

She stepped forward, the hearing aid’s pulse now a frantic drumbeat in her ear. [550]
*"Where is she?"* Lena asked, her voice steadier than she felt. [565]
Elias pointed to the atrium’s far corner, where the mist coiled like a living thing. [587]
*"They took her because she heard them first,"* he said. *"Just like they’ll take you."* [611]

Lena didn’t flinch. [616]
She’d spent her life assuring the lost that they weren’t alone, even if it meant following them into the dark. [644]
The last photograph in her pocket was proof of that. [657]
She adjusted the hearing aid, tracking the faint pulses deeper into the mist. [677]

A voice, barely a breath, called her name. [687]
Miriam’s. [690]
Lena ran. [693]

The atrium twisted around her, the walls bleeding into the past. [711]
She saw Miriam now, younger than in the photograph, her hands pressed to her ears as if trying to block out the voices. [741]
*"They’re not just voices,"* Miriam whispered. *"They’re echoes of the ones who were never heard."* [767]

Lena reached out, her fingers brushing Miriam’s sleeve. [781]
The mist recoiled. [785]
For a moment, the atrium was silent. [796]
Then the dead called again, louder this time, their voices weaving into a chorus of need. [822]
Lena smiled. [825]
She was exactly where she was meant to be. [835]
