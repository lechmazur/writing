The storm had clawed the sky into tatters by the time Elias found the archway. [13]
Its stones, slick with rain and salt, hummed faintly under his fingertips—like the turbines of a distant ship, always turning, always learning. [33]
Elias was a driftwood sculptor, spirited in the way of those who carve the sea’s cast-offs into something resembling permanence. [53]
He had followed the GPS until it sputtered into static, its last coordinates depositing him here, at the edge of the world where the waves gnawed at the cliffs. [81]

The lantern slide was tucked in his coat pocket, its glass cool against his ribs. [96]
It was an old thing, handed down from his grandmother, who had sworn it held more than light. [114]
"Magic," she’d said, "is just time pretending to be still." [125]
Elias had never believed her, not until the slide slipped from his fingers and shattered on the archway’s threshold. [146]
The pieces didn’t scatter. [151]
They *rearranged*, forming a mosaic of a woman in a high-collared coat, her face half-obscured by fog. [171]

A voice, smooth as oiled gears, whispered from the stones: "You’ve come to reimagine us." [186]
Elias turned. [188]
The woman from the slide stood beneath the arch, her coat damp, her eyes reflecting the storm’s turbulence. [209]
She was no ghost—her breath misted in the cold air—but she moved like someone who had stepped out of time itself. [232]
"I’m Mara," she said, "and this arch is a door, though not the kind you’re used to." [250]
Elias, perpetually learning, didn’t question it. [258]
He had spent his life scaffolding complexity with simplicity, turning tangled roots into faces, broken planks into wings. [279]
If time could be woven like driftwood, then alliances could be too. [292]

Mara led him through the arch. [298]
The world on the other side was the same, yet not—the storm still raged, but the air smelled of ozone and old books. [324]
"Timewoven alliances," she explained, "are the threads that hold the world together when the maps fail." [346]
Elias understood. [349]
He had always worked through layered meanings, seeing the ship in the splinter, the story in the grain. [369]
Now, the archway was a puzzle, and the lantern slide its key. [381]

They followed the hum of the turbines, which grew louder as they walked, until they stood before a cavern mouth where the walls pulsed with light. [412]
Inside, figures moved in slow, deliberate patterns—people from different eras, all working in unison. [433]
One man, dressed in a pilot’s jacket, adjusted a gear the size of a wagon wheel. [449]
A woman in a Victorian dress fed driftwood into a furnace. [461]
A child, no older than ten, painted symbols onto the stones with ink that glowed like embers. [480]

"This is how we keep the world from unraveling," Mara said. [491]
"When the GPS fails, when the storms erase the roads, we rebuild the paths." [510]
Elias’s hands itched. [514]
He knelt and gathered a handful of driftwood from the cavern floor, its edges worn smooth by centuries of tides. [540]
The pieces fit together in his mind before he even touched them. [554]

He carved. [556]
Not a face, not a wing, but a bridge—one that spanned the gap between the archway and the cavern, between the past and the present. [586]
The others paused to watch, their tools silent, their breaths held. [600]
When he finished, the bridge shimmered, its edges fraying into threads of light. [619]
Mara smiled. [622]
"Now you’re part of it," she said. [630]

The storm outside quieted, as if listening. [639]
Elias placed the last piece of the lantern slide into the bridge’s center, where it flared like a beacon. [660]
The turbines hummed louder, deeper, a song of time and wood and the endless work of keeping the world whole. [688]
He didn’t know how long he’d stay, or if he’d ever leave. [701]
But the archway was no longer just an archway, and the driftwood was no longer just driftwood. [721]
They were timewoven now, stitched into the fabric of something larger. [736]

And Elias, who had always been learning, finally understood. [747]
