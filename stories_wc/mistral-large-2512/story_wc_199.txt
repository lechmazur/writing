The ashen skyborne arbor stretched like a skeletal hand above the village of Veyth, its branches heavy with leaves that whispered secrets as they fell. [22]
Liora, the orderly seed sorter, knelt in the damp earth, her fingers brushing the soil with the precision of someone who had spent a lifetime arranging life’s smallest fragments. [53]
She had come here during the hush where past meets prophecy, a time when the air thickened with unspoken futures and the wind carried the weight of old stories. [90]
Her motivation was simple: to decode the message in falling leaves, a task she had assigned herself after years of sorting seeds into neat, labeled jars. [124]
If order could be found in chaos, she reasoned, then the leaves—each one a fleeting note in nature’s grand composition—must hold a pattern. [154]

The villagers spoke of the arbor in hushed tones, weaving it into their regional folklore as a place where the dead lingered, not as ghosts, but as echoes in the rustling branches. [188]
Liora didn’t believe in ghosts, but she believed in patterns, and the arbor’s leaves fell in rhythms that defied randomness. [215]
She had spent months building tiny monuments to forgotten things—stacked pebbles, woven grass, delicate sculptures of twigs—each one a testament to something lost but not erased. [253]
The monuments dotted the arbor’s roots like silent sentinels, and Liora tended to them daily, prodding them gently to ensure they hadn’t shifted in the night. [286]

One evening, as the light bled into twilight, she noticed a speck of dust glinting on a leaf. [309]
It was a moonstone cabochon dust speck, so fine it seemed to hum with its own light. [331]
Liora plucked the leaf, turning it in her palm, and the speck caught the last rays of the sun, casting a pale blue glow onto her skin. [364]
She had never seen anything like it, and yet, it felt familiar, as if it had always been waiting for her. [390]

That night, she dreamed of the arbor’s roots twisting into the earth, pulling her deeper into a world where the leaves were not dead but dormant, holding memories of lives lived and yet to be. [437]
When she woke, her hands were stained with moss, and her hair had grown tangled with vines. [463]
She emerged transformed, always—her edges softened, her movements slower, as if she had absorbed some of the arbor’s quiet wisdom. [499]

The next morning, she returned to the arbor and found the moonstone speck had multiplied, dusting the leaves like a constellation of tiny stars. [535]
She prodded one of her monuments, a spiral of pebbles, and it crumbled, releasing a puff of silver dust into the air. [565]
The dust settled on her skin, and suddenly, she understood the leaves’ message: they were not falling randomly but in sequences, each one a word in a language older than time. [611]

Liora began to arrange them, her fingers moving with the certainty of someone who had spent a lifetime sorting seeds. [643]
The leaves spelled out names—names of the forgotten, names of those who had come before and those who would come after. [678]
She built a new monument, this one larger, a circle of stones with the moonstone speck at its center. [708]
As she placed the last stone, the arbor’s branches trembled, and the leaves rained down in a shower of light. [737]

The villagers found her there at dawn, her hands still clutching a leaf, her eyes reflecting the ashen sky. [765]
They whispered that she had become part of the folklore now, a woman who had listened to the trees and emerged transformed. [799]
Liora smiled, moss still clinging to her sleeves, and began to sort the leaves into patterns only she could see. [829]
