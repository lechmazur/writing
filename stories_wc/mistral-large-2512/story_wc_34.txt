The mist curled around Elias’s ankles like a living thing, thick enough to swallow the cobblestones of the courtyard above the clouds. [18]
He adjusted the strap of his lute, its polished wood warm against his palm despite the chill. [33]
No one had asked for a balladeer in years—not since the last of the sky-dwellers drifted away, their voices lost to the wind. [61]
But Elias had come anyway, because the silence here was different: it hummed, like a string plucked just out of hearing. [85]

A flower press bolt plate lay abandoned near the courtyard’s edge, its iron surface rusted in the shape of a forgotten bloom. [110]
Elias crouched, running his fingers over the grooves. [117]
It was the kind of thing a lover might use to preserve a farewell, or a parent to keep a child’s first petal. [138]
Now it was just another relic, another whisper in the mist. [149]

Then he saw the graffiti. [153]
Not the usual scrawls of names or crude jokes, but patterns—delicate, deliberate—sprayed in phosphorescent paint across the courtyard’s low wall. [180]
Elias traced them with his fingertips, his breath catching as the shapes resolved into letters, then words, then a plea: *I am still here. [205]*
The paint glowed faintly, as if lit from within. [214]

A ghost in code. [218]
That’s what the old sailors had called it when their ships’ logs filled with messages from hands no longer aboard. [242]
Elias had never believed them—until now. [247]
The mist thinned for a moment, and he saw it: a figure, driftingly alert, standing where the wall met the void. [270]
It was made of the same shimmer as the graffiti, its edges flickering like a candle flame. [287]

“You’re encoding your needs,” Elias murmured, the realization settling like a weight. [303]
The figure tilted its head, and the mist coiled tighter, as if listening. [317]
He strummed a chord on his lute, soft and questioning. [326]
The ghost—if that’s what it was—reached out, its fingers passing through the bolt plate with a sound like wind through reeds. [347]

Between lightning and thunder, the world held its breath. [356]
Elias felt it in his bones: the storm was coming, and with it, the chance to give this spirit a voice. [378]
He unslung his lute and began to play, weaving the graffiti’s words into melody. [393]
The notes hung in the air, golden and trembling, as the ghost leaned closer, its form solidifying with each passing second. [422]

“What do you need?” Elias asked, his voice barely above the hum of the clouds. [438]
The ghost’s lips moved, but no sound came. [445]
Instead, the graffiti on the wall shifted, the letters rearranging themselves into new shapes: *To be remembered. [467]*
Elias’s throat tightened. [472]

He played faster, the music swelling like the tide, and the ghost’s form flickered brighter, its edges sharpening. [498]
The bolt plate rattled against the cobblestones, drawn to the spirit’s touch. [512]
Elias understood then: the iron wasn’t just a tool—it was a key. [527]
He pressed it into the ghost’s palm, and the metal sank in, melding with the shimmer. [545]

A crack of lightning split the sky, and for a heartbeat, the ghost was whole—a woman, her face lined with sorrow, her hands clutching the bolt plate like a lifeline. [580]
“Thank you,” she whispered, her voice the sound of distant bells. [594]
Then the thunder came, a deep, resonant boom that shook the courtyard, and she was gone, leaving only the faintest imprint on the mist. [628]

Elias exhaled, his fingers stilling on the lute strings. [638]
The graffiti on the wall had changed again, the letters now forming a single word: *Enough. [655]
He smiled, though his eyes stung. [663]

The storm rolled in, the clouds swallowing the courtyard whole, but Elias didn’t move. [681]
He stayed, playing a tinkersong of wonder, because some needs could only be articulated in the space between lightning and thunder. [712]
And some ghosts, he knew, would always be listening. [725]
