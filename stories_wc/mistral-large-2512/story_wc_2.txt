The tinkerer’s workshop smelled of oil and rust, a scent so familiar it had long since stopped registering as unpleasant. [12]
Elias adjusted the broken clock face in his hands, its brass gears frozen mid-tick, their purpose lost to time. [28]
He had spent years fixing things that no one else cared to mend, but this clock was different—its mechanism was intact, yet it refused to keep time, as if mocking the very concept. [63]
The admiral’s lost compass rose lay on the workbench beside him, its delicate engravings worn smooth by salt and neglect. [87]
Elias had found it three days prior, half-buried in the mud near the docks, its needle spinning wildly before settling on nothing at all. [117]

Beneath the ashes of the old city, the subterranean waterfall roared, its mist curling into the cracks of the world above. [143]
Elias had heard the stories—how the waterfall was a gateway, how it whispered secrets to those who listened. [165]
But he had never believed them, not until the compass rose had led him there, its needle trembling toward the dark. [189]
He packed his tools into a satchel, the weight of the clock and the compass pulling at his shoulders. [210]
If coincidence had brought him this far, it was time to see if it could become a pattern. [230]

The neglected greenhouse stood at the edge of the city’s ruins, its glass panes cracked, its iron frame rusted through. [255]
Swirling leaves danced in the wind, their edges curled and brittle, as if the very air resisted stillness. [278]
Elias pushed through the overgrowth, the compass rose warm in his palm. [292]
He had come here to improvise, to let the chaos of the moment guide him. [310]
The admiral’s compass had no true north, and neither, it seemed, did he. [327]

Inside, the greenhouse was a tomb of forgotten plants, their vines choking the benches, their roots twisting toward the light. [348]
Elias knelt, brushing aside the leaves to reveal a trapdoor, its hinges groaning as he lifted it. [366]
The subterranean waterfall waited below, its roar louder now, a pulse in the dark. [384]
He descended, the compass rose glowing faintly in the damp air. [398]

The cavern opened before him, the waterfall crashing into a pool of black water. [418]
Mist clung to his skin, and for the first time, Elias felt the weight of his uncertainty—no, not uncertainty, something more. [446]
Uncertainly certain, the phrase echoed in his mind. [456]
He had spent his life chasing precision, but what if the truth lay in the spaces between the ticks of the clock? [483]

The compass rose spun wildly as he approached the waterfall, its needle pointing not to a direction, but to the churning water itself. [515]
Elias hesitated, then stepped forward, the mist swallowing him whole. [532]
The world dissolved into sound—the rush of water, the groan of stone, the whisper of something just beyond hearing. [558]

When he opened his eyes, he was no longer in the cavern. [570]
A city stretched before him, its towers wreathed in smoke, its streets alive with figures who moved like clockwork, their steps synchronized, their faces blank. [601]
Elias clutched the compass rose, its needle now still, pointing toward a single building at the city’s heart. [628]
He had come to befriend uncertainty in planning, but this was something else entirely—a world where time had stopped, where the broken clock in his satchel might finally make sense. [666]

A figure approached, their robes tattered, their eyes sharp with recognition. [685]
"You’ve come at last," they said, their voice like the ticking of a clock. [701]
Elias realized then that the compass had never been lost. [715]
It had been waiting. [719]
And so had he. [723]

The tinkerer adjusted his grip on the clock, its gears humming to life for the first time in years. [746]
The city’s rhythm faltered, the figures pausing mid-step. [761]
Elias smiled. [764]
Uncertainty was not the enemy. [770]
It was the only thing that could set them free. [782]
