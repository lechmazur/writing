The cobalt fortress loomed under a sky choked with snow, its towers clawing at the twilight like frozen fingers. [16]
Inside, the air smelled of old parchment and rust, a seraphically mundane blend that clung to the throat. [34]
Elias, the silent-choir bellhop, moved through the halls with the precision of a metronome, his gloved hands never trembling despite the cold. [61]
He had taken this job during his nerve regeneration, a period where every sensation was either absent or amplified into agony. [87]
The doctors had warned him about the risk, but Elias needed to understand the cost of safety—what it meant to trade pain for numbness, silence for survival. [119]

His route always began at the grand piano in the east wing, where a single bolt on the bench had loosened over time. [143]
No one else seemed to notice the slight discoloration on the dusty spiral staircase leading to the practice rooms, but Elias did. [169]
It was a rusted streak, barely wider than a hair, yet it marked the boundary between the fortress’s curated stillness and the unpardonable silence beneath it. [199]
He had spent weeks tracing its origin, following it like a thread through the labyrinth of corridors. [223]

Tonight, the bolt on the piano bench was gone. [233]
Elias knelt, brushing his fingers over the empty hole where it had been. [249]
The absence was deliberate—someone had removed it, and he knew who. [263]
The fortress’s matron, Madame Veyra, had a habit of erasing imperfections before they could be questioned. [284]
She called it maintenance; Elias called it a lie. [293]

He remained motionless for a long moment, listening to the fortress breathe around him. [311]
The snow outside muffled everything, but inside, the silence was a living thing, pressing against his ears. [335]
It was the same silence that had swallowed his voice years ago, when the accident left him unable to speak. [357]
Now, it was swallowing the truth. [365]

Elias stood and followed the discoloration up the staircase, his boots making no sound on the worn steps. [389]
At the top, he found Madame Veyra standing in the doorway of the practice room, her back to him. [415]
She was humming a tune he recognized—the same one the silent choir had rehearsed before the accident. [440]
The notes were wrong, though, just slightly off-key, as if she were trying to remember them through a fog. [465]

“You took the bolt,” Elias signed, his fingers moving with deliberate slowness. [481]
Madame Veyra turned, her expression serene. [491]
“Some things are better left undone,” she said. [502]
“Like the choir?” he signed. [510]
Her smile didn’t waver. [515]
“The cost of safety is forgetting,” she replied. [526]

Elias looked past her into the practice room. [537]
The piano was gone, replaced by a single chair and a music stand. [552]
On the stand was a sheet of paper, blank except for a single measure of music. [570]
He recognized it—the last note the choir had sung before the collapse. [587]
The unpardonable silence had begun there, in the space between that note and the scream that followed. [612]

Madame Veyra stepped aside, gesturing for him to enter. [625]
“You want to understand?” she asked. [633]
Elias nodded. [636]
She picked up the sheet music and held it to the light. [649]
“The fortress keeps us safe,” she said. [657]
“But safety has a price.” [664]

He took the paper from her, his fingers brushing the empty staff lines. [679]
The discoloration on the staircase had been a clue, a crack in the fortress’s perfect facade. [699]
And now, standing here, he realized the bolt on the piano bench had been more than a loose screw—it had been a question. [728]
Why had the choir been silenced? [737]
Why had the music stopped? [744]

Madame Veyra watched him, her eyes reflecting the frostbitten hope that still flickered in his chest. [766]
“Some silences are necessary,” she murmured. [776]
Elias shook his head. [781]
He placed the sheet music back on the stand and turned to leave. [797]
The bolt was gone, but the question remained. [807]
And he would not let it go unanswered. [815]
