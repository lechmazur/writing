The library’s east wing had always been too quiet, even before the power failed. [12]
Elias adjusted his glasses, the lenses smudged from hours of squinting in the dim glow of emergency lights, and pressed his palm against the cold metal grate of the ventilation shaft. [39]
He had lived in these crawl spaces for seven years, ever since the night he’d slipped between the stacks and never left. [67]
The city’s lights flickered outside the high arched windows, a stuttering pulse that mirrored the rhythm of his own heartbeat. [93]

He was kindly methodical in everything he did, from cataloging the forgotten books he found in the walls to mending the frayed edges of his own frayed existence. [128]
Tonight, though, method wouldn’t be enough. [136]
He had to move fast. [141]

The ferromagnetic tape reel fragment was tucked into the pocket of his oversized sweater, its edges jagged where it had snapped from the rest of the spool. [170]
He’d found it weeks ago, wedged behind a loose panel in the sub-basement, its surface dusted with decades of neglect. [191]
At first, he’d assumed it was just another relic of the library’s past—until he’d held it up to the light and seen the faint, handwritten label: *"Property of Dr. Liora Voss. Do not erase."* [228]
The name had sent a jolt through him. [237]
Voss had been the city’s most famous archivist before she vanished thirty years ago, leaving behind only whispers and a single, half-finished manuscript. [263]
Elias had spent every spare moment since then uncovering in pipe chases, tracing the labyrinth of ducts and forgotten corridors, searching for more. [288]

The outage had given him the perfect cover. [296]
The library’s backup generators were old, their hum uneven, casting long shadows that stretched like fingers across the marble floors. [322]
He slipped from the vent into the narrow space behind the reference desk, his sneakers silent on the worn carpet. [343]
The air smelled of old paper and lemon oil, the scent triggering a sense memory so sharp it nearly knocked him back: his mother’s hands, steady and warm, turning the pages of a picture book while rain tapped against their apartment window. [382]
He swallowed hard. [385]
That was the problem with sense memories—they made you ache for things you could never have again. [408]

His cache was hidden beneath a loose floorboard in the rare manuscripts room, a shoebox filled with scraps of Voss’s work. [434]
He’d found most of them by accident, tucked into the spines of books or wedged behind radiators, as if someone had been trying to hide them in plain sight. [462]
But this tape—this was different. [469]
It felt like a key. [474]

The lights flickered again, and for a heartbeat, the library was plunged into darkness. [493]
Elias froze, listening to the distant murmur of librarians calling to one another, their voices muffled by the stacks. [517]
He had to hurry. [522]

He knelt beside the floorboard, prying it up with a butter knife he’d stolen from the staff lounge. [544]
Inside, the shoebox was exactly where he’d left it, its contents untouched. [558]
He added the tape fragment to the pile, then hesitated. [567]
Something about the way the label had been written—urgent, almost desperate—made him think Voss hadn’t just vanished. [593]
She’d been hiding. [597]

A floorboard creaked in the hallway. [604]
Elias’s breath hitched. [607]
He wasn’t supposed to be here. [613]
No one was supposed to know he existed. [621]
But if he was right about Voss, then maybe—just maybe—he could change that. [640]

He slid the shoebox back into its hiding place and replaced the floorboard, his fingers working quickly. [662]
The creaking came again, closer this time. [669]
He ducked behind a shelf just as the door to the rare manuscripts room swung open. [690]
A beam of light cut through the darkness, illuminating the dust motes swirling in the air. [711]
Elias held his breath. [715]

"Hello?" a voice called, soft but clear. [722]
It was Mara, the head librarian’s assistant, the one who always left extra sandwiches in the break room on Fridays. [743]
She had a way of looking at the world like she was trying to memorize it, like she knew things were slipping away. [769]
Elias had watched her for years, always from the shadows. [782]

He could step forward now. [788]
He could show her the tape, the shoebox, all of it. [799]
But what if she didn’t believe him? [806]
What if she called security? [812]

The light swept across the room, passing over the spot where he crouched. [828]
Elias closed his eyes. [832]
