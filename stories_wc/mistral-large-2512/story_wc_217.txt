The cobalt lagoon lay still after the rain, its surface a sheet of hammered metal under the first pale light. [16]
Mira knelt at the water’s edge, her fingers brushing the damp sand where the tide had left its lace. [35]
She was the quiet shoreline poet, known for verses that held the weight of half-sung waves. [54]
This morning, the air hummed with the kind of burnished hush that made her chest ache—soft, expectant, like the moment before a held breath is released. [88]

A drake’s tail feather, iridescent as oil on water, had washed ashore near her bare feet. [106]
She lifted it carefully, the vanes catching the light like shattered stained glass. [120]
It was incomplete, missing the downy fluff at its base, yet the way it gleamed made her pulse quicken. [141]
Mira had spent years chasing beauty in the unfinished, the chipped, the frayed—anything that whispered of stories still being told. [166]

She had come to the lagoon to tend to her grief, though she would never call it that aloud. [184]
Her brother’s laughter had once echoed across these waters, but now the silence was a living thing, coiled around her ribs. [209]
She pressed the feather to her palm, its warmth seeping into her skin. [223]
Perhaps, she thought, healing wasn’t about mending what was broken, but harmonizing discord—letting the jagged edges hum together until they made something new. [256]

A kite string snapped somewhere above the cliffs, the sound sharp as a bone breaking. [273]
Mira flinched, then exhaled. [278]
The moment felt like a wound reopening, but also like an invitation. [291]
She stood, the feather tucked into her belt, and waded into the shallows. [307]
The water was cool, but not unkind, and it lapped at her ankles with warmly attentive patience, as if it had been waiting for her. [336]

That was when she saw them—woven dawns, threads of pink and gold tangled in the reeds. [352]
Not the sunrise itself, but its reflection, fractured and recombined by the lagoon’s ripples. [369]
Each shimmering strand was a promise, a half-formed thing yearning to be whole. [386]
Mira reached out, her fingers trembling. [395]

She had spent so long staring at the cracks in the world that she’d forgotten how to see the light spilling through them. [423]
The feather at her waist was proof—beauty didn’t need perfection. [438]
It only needed someone willing to look. [447]

She began to write in her mind, the words rising like bubbles from the lagoon’s depths. [465]
*What if the dawn is not a thing to be caught, but a thing to be woven?* [483]
*What if the snapped string is not an ending, but a thread pulled loose for someone else to take up?* [511]

Mira closed her eyes and let the water hold her. [523]
The grief was still there, but so was the feather, the light, the hush. [538]
She had come to tend to her sorrow, but the lagoon had given her something else: a way to harmonize it into something like hope. [568]

When she opened her eyes again, the woven dawns had shifted, the colors bleeding into the sky. [589]
The drake’s feather was now a quill in her hand, and the page before her was blank no longer. [612]
The words came slowly at first, then all at once, as if the lagoon itself had been waiting for her to begin. [640]

She wrote of snapped strings and shattered feathers, of light that refused to be contained. [658]
She wrote of the quiet between waves, where the world held its breath. [675]
And when the sun finally crested the cliffs, she was still writing, the burnished hush of the lagoon wrapped around her like a second skin. [706]

The poem would never be finished—none of them ever were. [720]
But that was the point. [725]
Beauty lived in the incomplete, in the spaces between what was and what could be. [745]
Mira smiled, her fingers stained with ink and salt. [757]
She had come to the shore to tend to her grief, but she was leaving with something far greater: the understanding that even broken things could sing. [793]
