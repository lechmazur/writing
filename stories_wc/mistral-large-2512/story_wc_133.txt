The painter had not slept in three days, not since the dreams began. [12]
They slithered into his mind like oil on water, vivid and suffocating, always ending with the same image: a woman’s hand clutching an amber brooch, its facets catching the light of a dying sun. [43]
He lived on a tidal island, a jagged spit of rock and driftwood where the sea retreated twice a day, leaving behind slick trails of salt and secrets. [78]
After the water wars, the world had fractured, and this place—half drowned, half free—felt like the last honest corner of it. [106]

His studio was a gutted fishing shack, its walls patched with tar and hope. [121]
The paint on his canvases never dried; he worked in layers, scraping away at the surface only to smear it back on, as if trying to dig through time itself. [150]
The locals called him *the Sleepless*, and they left offerings at his door—cans of preserved peaches, rusted nails, a child’s drawing of a boat. [177]
He took none of it. [180]
What he wanted couldn’t be given. [185]

Then the rains came. [190]
Not the gentle drizzle of old stories, but a relentless downpour, the kind that carved rivers into dirt and turned the island’s single road into a glistening snake. [220]
The painter stood in the doorway, watching the water pool in the hollows of his hands. [237]
He had read once that rain carried memory, that every drop held the echo of somewhere else. [258]
If that was true, then the island was drowning in ghosts. [268]

He followed the trails. [273]
Not the ones left by the tide—those were too obvious, too loud—but the ones the rain made as it sluiced down the cliffs, tracing paths only the desperate or the foolish would take. [312]
The brooch from his dreams burned in his pocket, though he didn’t remember putting it there. [331]
It was warm, almost alive, and when he pressed it to his wrist, the skin there flushed pink, as if recognizing something long lost. [359]

The path led him to a cave, its mouth half-hidden by brambles and the skeletal remains of a ship’s mast. [384]
Inside, the air smelled of wet stone and something older—copper, maybe, or the ghost of a fire. [408]
The walls were painted. [413]
Not with pigment, but with something darker, thicker. [423]
Blood? [425]
No—amber. [427]
The resin had been melted, poured in swirling patterns across the rock, forming shapes that made his eyes ache: a woman’s face, a ship breaking apart, a hand reaching for something just out of grasp. [474]

He knew her. [477]
Not by name, but by the way his chest tightened when he looked at her. [497]
She was the one from the dreams, the one who had pressed the brooch into his palm while he slept. [522]
And she was here, in the amber, trapped like an insect in sap. [538]

A voice, wryly earnest, cut through the dark. [548]
*"You’re late."* [551]
The painter turned. [554]
A woman stood in the shadows, her coat slick with rain, her fingers stained the same gold as the brooch. [578]
She looked like she hadn’t slept in years either. [588]

*"Who are you?"* he asked. [594]
*"The one who left the trail,"* she said. [601]
*"And the brooch?"* [605]
*"A key. Or a lock. Depends on what you’re trying to open."* [623]
She stepped forward, her boots leaving wet prints on the cave floor. [640]
*"The water wars didn’t just drown cities. They drowned stories. And stories, like people, don’t stay buried."* [671]

He understood then. [676]
The dreams, the brooch, the cave—it was all an exchange. [691]
She had given him the weight of her memory, and now she wanted something in return. [714]
Not the brooch. [718]
Something deeper. [721]

*"I paint to remember,"* he said. [730]
*"No,"* she corrected, *"you paint to forget. But forgetting isn’t the same as threshing meaning from experience."* [755]
She held out her hand. [761]
*"Come. There’s more to see."* [769]

Outside, the rain had stopped. [775]
The tide was coming in, swallowing the paths behind them. [790]
The painter hesitated, then took her hand. [800]
The brooch burned between them. [805]
Some convergences, he realized, were unearthed not by digging, but by being pulled under. [828]
[830]
