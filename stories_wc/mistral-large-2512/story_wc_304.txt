The skyborne grotto hung suspended between the aurora’s shimmering curtains, a cavern of ice and starlight where the air itself seemed to hum with quiet reverence. [23]
Liora, the beautician mortician, stood at its threshold, her breath curling like silver thread in the frigid stillness. [43]
She had come here not to prepare the dead, but to preserve the living—or what remained of them. [67]
In her palm rested an emerald chip, no larger than a tear, its facets catching the aurora’s glow and scattering it into a thousand fractured dreams. [98]

The grotto was a place of thresholds, where time stretched thin and the boundary between life and oblivion blurred. [125]
Liora had spent years finding patterns in the static of existence, tracing the way souls flickered before extinguishing. [148]
Tonight, she was lucidly watchful, her gaze sharp as the ice beneath her boots, for she had sensed the final spark of someone slipping away. [178]
The dying did not scream here; they sighed, their last breaths dissolving into the aurora’s radiant hush. [201]

She knelt beside a figure wrapped in frost-kissed linen, their face serene, their chest still. [223]
The emerald chip pulsed faintly in her hand, as if recognizing the proximity of departure. [242]
Liora pressed it to the figure’s lips, whispering words older than the grotto itself. [260]
The ritual was simple: to infuse the fading essence with the emerald’s captured light, to hold back the dark for just a moment longer. [288]

The aurora rippled overhead, its colors deepening from violet to indigo, as if the sky itself mourned. [312]
Liora had learned long ago that beauty and death were not opposites but companions, both requiring the same delicate touch. [342]
She had been a beautician once, painting lips and brushing hair for weddings and festivals, until she realized the most profound beauty lay in the quiet moments before the end. [377]
That was when she became a mortician too, not to bury the dead, but to honor the threshold they crossed. [405]

The figure’s fingers twitched. [412]
A breath, shallow but unmistakable, stirred the linen. [427]
Liora exhaled, her own breath shaky with relief. [441]
The emerald chip dimmed, its light absorbed into the figure’s skin, a temporary reprieve. [464]
She knew it wouldn’t last—the spark would fade again, drawn inexorably toward the void. [488]
But for now, the threshold held, and the stillness was not an ending but a pause. [512]

The grotto’s walls hummed, the ice singing a low, wordless melody. [529]
Liora traced the patterns of frost on the figure’s brow, memorizing the way the light played across their skin. [557]
She had come here to capture one last spark before oblivion, but in doing so, she had found something else: the quiet defiance of holding on. [592]
The aurora flared, casting the grotto in emerald and gold, and for a moment, the world felt suspended in time. [625]

Then the figure’s eyes opened, lucid and bright, reflecting the sky’s glow. [645]
Liora smiled, her heart aching with the beauty of it. [658]
This was why she did what she did—not to cheat death, but to remind the living of its radiant hush. [688]
The emerald chip in her palm flickered once more before going dark, its purpose fulfilled. [714]
She placed it gently on the figure’s chest, a keepsake for the journey ahead. [735]

The aurora dimmed, the grotto’s light softening into twilight. [750]
Liora stood, her shadow stretching long across the ice. [763]
The threshold of stillness had held, if only for a little while. [779]
And in that moment, she knew she would return, again and again, to stand watch at the edge of the world. [809]
For as long as there were sparks to capture, she would be there, lucidly watchful, infusing the dark with light. [837]
