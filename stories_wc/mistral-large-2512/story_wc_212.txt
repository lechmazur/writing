The atrium was a cathedral of ice, its vaulted ceiling woven from frost that caught the starlight like scattered diamonds. [15]
Liora knelt in the center, her breath curling in the frigid air, fingers brushing the cracked shell of the egg she had guarded for thirty winters. [39]
It had hatched at dawn—no fanfare, no crack of thunder, just a whisper of membrane yielding to the first warm touch of her palm. [71]
Now, the creature inside slept, its downy feathers damp with the last traces of its birth. [88]

She was an heirloom seed saver, though no one had called her that in years. [104]
The title belonged to a time before the frost took the fields, before the last apple tree withered into memory. [127]
Her grandmother had pressed the acorn cap into her hand on her tenth birthday, its edges worn smooth by generations of anxious fingers. [150]
"Hold it when the world feels too sharp," she’d said. [161]
Liora still did, though the cap was now a relic of a world that no longer grew. [177]

The vortex inheritance was not something she had asked for. [189]
It came with the egg, passed down like a curse or a blessing—she wasn’t sure which. [207]
The old texts spoke of it as a swirling force, a way to pull threads of time from the air and weave them anew. [230]
But no one had ever told her how it *felt*. [241]
Was it the weight of the acorn cap in her pocket, or the way the starlight seemed to bend around the sleeping hatchling? [262]

She needed to know the texture of borrowed time. [273]
Not just its shape, but the grain of it, the friction, the way it might resist or yield beneath her touch. [293]
The atrium was the only place left where the air still hummed with possibility, where the ice didn’t just preserve but *remembered*. [318]

Liora exhaled, and the frost on the floor rippled like water. [329]
The hatchling stirred, its beak parting in a silent yawn. [341]
She reached for the acorn cap, rolling it between her fingers until its furiously tranquil energy pulsed against her skin. [364]
The vortex was a storm in stillness, a scream muffled by snow. [378]

To reopen the past, she had to decrease entropy—unravel the knots of time until the threads lay loose enough to pluck. [402]
The old texts were vague on the *how*, but she had spent a lifetime coaxing life from stubborn soil. [425]
If the atrium could hold the cold without shattering, if the stars could watch without blinking, then perhaps she could hold time the same way. [450]

She pressed the acorn cap to the hatchling’s chest. [460]
The creature’s eyes flew open—black as the space between stars, deep as the roots of the world. [480]
A wind howled through the atrium, though the air had been still a heartbeat before. [499]
The frost on the walls began to melt, not from warmth, but from the sheer force of *unmaking*. [520]

Liora’s breath hitched. [524]
The hatchling’s feathers ruffled, and for a moment, she saw the atrium as it had been—a greenhouse, not a tomb. [548]
Vines coiled up the pillars, heavy with fruit. [557]
The scent of earth and rain filled her lungs, so vivid she could taste the loam. [573]

Then it was gone. [577]
The ice reasserted itself, the starlight dimmed, and the hatchling slumped back into sleep. [597]
But something had changed. [602]
The acorn cap in her hand was warm. [610]

She understood now. [614]
The texture of borrowed time was not smooth like glass, nor jagged like broken stone. [633]
It was *alive*—a living thing, pulsing with the rhythm of a heart that beat in two directions at once. [660]
The vortex inheritance was not a tool, but a promise: that what was lost could be found again, if only for a breath. [690]

Liora closed her fingers around the acorn cap. [701]
The hatchling’s eyelids fluttered, and she swore she saw the ghost of a smile in its dreams. [722]
She would reopen the past, not to dwell in it, but to carry its weight forward. [742]
The atrium was still icebound, the stars still distant, but the air no longer felt like an ending. [764]

It felt like a beginning. [769]
