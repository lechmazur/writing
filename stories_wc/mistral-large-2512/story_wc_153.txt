The mangrove roots twisted like the fingers of a drowning man, their gnarled limbs clutching at the brackish water below. [18]
Liora crouched on the slick boardwalk, her breath shallow, the gargoyle’s rainspout shard clutched in her palm. [39]
It was warm, despite the evening chill, as if the stone remembered the sun. [58]
She had found it three days ago, half-buried in the mud near the temple ruins, its jagged edge still sharp enough to draw blood if she pressed too hard. [92]
The medium had told her it would heal in moonlight, but Liora had yet to see proof. [110]

The spirits sang from the water, their voices weaving through the humid air like silk threads. [129]
They knew her name, or at least the shape of her regret. [143]
She had come to the mangrove labyrinth to find the moment before deciding—the instant when she had chosen silence over truth, when she had let the letter remain unsent. [179]
The apology waited there, suspended in the damp air, heavier than the humidity. [198]

Liora unfolded the crumpled paper from her pocket, its edges softened by salt and time. [217]
*"I should have spoken when you needed me,"* she had written, years ago, to her sister. [236]
The words had never left her desk drawer. [243]
Now, the condensation on the boardwalk’s railing formed new messages, droplets sliding into patterns that spelled *"too late"* and *"stay."* [268]
She wiped them away with her sleeve, but they returned, insistent. [278]

The medium had warned her about this place. [287]
*"The spirits will evoke what you fear most,"* she had said, her dark eyes unreadable. [308]
*"They don’t forgive. They only reflect."* [316]
Liora had laughed then, bitter. [323]
What was forgiveness but another kind of forgetting? [333]

She pressed the shard to her wrist, where a scar from a childhood fall still lingered. [351]
Moonlight spilled through the canopy, thin and silver, and she held her breath. [367]
The stone pulsed once, warm as a heartbeat, and the scar faded, not gone but softer, like a memory half-remembered. [396]
The spirits’ song shifted, their voices rising in something like approval. [415]

A figure emerged from the mist, her sister’s face but not her sister—older, wiser, her eyes full of the words Liora had never sent. [450]
*"You came,"* the apparition said, voice like the rustle of leaves. [461]
Liora’s throat tightened. [466]
*"I didn’t know how,"* she admitted. [474]
The figure smiled, sad. *"You still don’t."* [483]

The boardwalk creaked beneath them as the spirits’ song swelled, fierce and tender, a storm of sound that shook the mangroves. [512]
Condensation dripped from the leaves, forming words on the wood: *"Try."* [526]
Liora swallowed. [530]
The shard in her hand grew heavier, as if it knew the weight of the words she had carried. [553]

She unfolded the letter again, the ink blurred by time. [564]
The spirits stilled, their song hushing to a whisper. [576]
Liora took a breath, then another, and began to speak—not to the apparition, but to the air, to the unspoken thing between them. [610]
*"I was afraid,"* she said. [616]
The words hung in the humid dark, fragile as the first light of dawn. [636]

The figure reached out, her fingers brushing Liora’s cheek, leaving a trail of cool moisture. [660]
*"That’s the moment,"* she said. [667]
*"The one before deciding."* [674]

The shard glowed faintly, its light reflecting in the water below, where the spirits’ voices rose again, not in judgment but in something like relief. [711]
Liora closed her eyes. [716]
The apology was still unsent, but it no longer felt like a failure. [735]
It felt like the first step. [742]

The mangroves sighed around her, the roots shifting as if to make room. [760]
Somewhere in the distance, a bird called, sharp and clear. [774]
Liora tucked the shard into her pocket, its warmth steady against her thigh. [792]
The letter could wait. [799]
For now, she had found what she came for. [811]
