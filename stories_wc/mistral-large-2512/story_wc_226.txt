The canyon of endless echoes swallowed sound whole, then spat it back in fractured whispers. [12]
Lira stood at the edge of the Bone Towers, her fingers tracing the jagged ivory curves that spiraled toward the sky like the ribs of some long-dead god. [38]
The pale spire in the mist loomed ahead, its tip lost in the perpetual haze, a silent sentinel over the ritual to come. [64]
She had been warned not to touch it—no one had, not in centuries—but Lira was a defiant artist, and warnings were just another color on her palette. [95]

The air hummed with the weight of unspoken apologies, thick as the mist that curled around her ankles. [116]
This was the price of forgiveness, she knew: not the act itself, but the hollow ache of knowing it would never be enough. [141]
The towers amplified every breath, every rustle of her cloak, turning them into a chorus of ghosts. [159]
She had come to refract a single truth into many, to shatter the silence with something raw and real. [182]

A shadow moved in the mist. [187]
"Who’s there?" Lira called, her voice bouncing back at her in a dozen distorted echoes. [207]
The figure stepped forward—small, wiry, with eyes that gleamed innocently mischievous. [224]
"Just a friend," the stranger said, grinning. [233]
"Friends don’t lurk," Lira snapped, though her pulse quickened. [245]
The stranger plucked a bone shard from the ground and twirled it between their fingers. [261]
"Friends don’t judge either," they said, "but you’re about to." [274]

Lira exhaled through her nose. [280]
She had no time for games, not before the ritual. [292]
The elders had demanded she prepare, but preparation was just another word for surrender. [310]
She needed to break something first. [317]
"Fine," she said. "Tell me your name." [326]
"Call me Echo," the stranger said, and the towers groaned in response. [342]

Echo led her to a clearing where the bone towers leaned inward like conspirators. [359]
"Poetry," they announced, "is the only way to refract truth here." [373]
Lira scoffed. "I don’t write poetry." [382]
"You do now," Echo said, pressing the bone shard into her palm. [394]
The shard was warm, almost pulsing. [402]

Lira hesitated, then began. [407]
"Forgiveness is a blade," she said, "sharpened on the whetstone of silence." [428]
The words hung in the air, refracting into new shapes: *blade*, *whetstone*, *silence*. [442]
Echo clapped, delighted. [446]
"Again," they urged. [450]

This time, Lira spoke of the pale spire, how it stood unyielding, a monument to what was never said. [480]
The echoes twisted her words—*unyielding*, *monument*, *never said*—until they became a chant. [500]
The mist thickened, swirling around her ankles like a living thing. [515]

Echo’s grin widened. [520]
"You’re doing it," they said. "You’re breaking the hush." [534]
Lira’s hands trembled. [538]
This was power, raw and untamed, the kind that could unravel empires or mend broken souls. [560]
But empires weren’t her concern. [567]
She wanted to mend herself. [572]

The ritual loomed, a specter in the back of her mind. [585]
The elders would demand penance, but penance was just another kind of silence. [602]
She needed something louder. [608]
"One more," she whispered. [613]

Lira spoke of the canyon, how it swallowed voices and gave back only fragments. [635]
The towers shuddered. [640]
The pale spire glowed faintly, as if waking from a long slumber. [656]
Echo’s mischief faded, replaced by something like awe. [669]
"You’re not refracting truth," they said. "You’re forging it." [686]

The mist parted. [691]
For the first time, Lira saw the spire clearly—its surface etched with thousands of tiny, overlapping words. [716]
Her words. [719]
The price of forgiveness wasn’t silence. [728]
It was this: the courage to speak, even when the echoes screamed back. [747]

Echo squeezed her hand. [753]
"Now you’re ready," they said. [759]
Lira didn’t feel ready. [764]
But she felt something worse—alive. [771]

The ritual could wait. [776]
She had a truth to shatter first. [784]
[785]
