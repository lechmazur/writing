The glass orchard library drifted upon a swirling sea of clouds, its crystalline branches heavy with books that hummed when touched. [18]
Inside, the clean slate vendor arranged his stall beneath a skylight that fractured sunlight into prismatic dust. [35]
His name was Elias, though no one had asked—names were just another story waiting to be written. [55]
The bottled moonlight stood among his wares, its silver liquid swirling as if alive, casting shifting shadows on the polished counter. [81]
It was the only item he hadn’t priced, not because he didn’t know its worth, but because he wasn’t sure what it was worth to him. [111]

The store had opened an hour ago, but the lull had settled like a held breath, the kind that comes just before the first customer steps inside. [140]
Elias traced a finger along the bottle’s neck, feeling the cool pulse of something older than words. [159]
He had come here to find the place where stories begin, though he wasn’t entirely sure what that meant—only that it felt like a question without an answer, a door without a handle. [195]
The library’s curator, an androgynous figure with ink-stained fingers, had warned him: *You won’t find it by looking.* [218]
*Then how?* Elias had asked. [224]
*By quantifying absence,* they’d replied, before vanishing into the stacks. [239]

The air smelled of ozone and old paper, the kind of scent that made thoughts feel mindfully scattered, like seeds tossed into the wind. [262]
Elias exhaled, watching his breath fog the glass counter. [273]
He had incised his own name into the wood earlier, not out of pride, but to prove he existed—though the letters had already begun to fade. [299]
The library was like that: things appeared and disappeared, not because they were lost, but because they were still being decided. [328]

A chime sounded as the door opened, though no one entered. [343]
Elias straightened, his pulse quickening. [351]
Then she stepped inside—a woman in a coat woven from dandelion fluff, her eyes reflecting the bottled moonlight like twin moons. [380]
*You’re the vendor,* she said, though it wasn’t a question. [392]
*And you’re the first customer,* he replied, though it wasn’t an answer. [408]

She approached the stall, her fingers hovering over the bottled moonlight. [423]
*What is it?* she asked. [428]
*A story that hasn’t been told yet,* Elias said. [439]
She smiled, but it was the kind of smile that carried its own weight, like a secret too heavy to keep. [460]
*I’ll take it,* she said, pressing a coin into his palm. [473]
The coin was warm, and when he turned it over, he saw it wasn’t metal at all, but a compressed sigh. [496]

The woman uncorked the bottle, and the moonlight spilled onto the counter, pooling into the shape of a key. [522]
*Where does this go?* she asked. [530]
*Where do any of them go?* Elias said, gesturing to the library’s endless shelves. [547]
She laughed, but the sound was fragmented, like a melody half-remembered. [563]
*You don’t know either, do you?* [570]
*No,* he admitted. *But I think that’s the point.* [582]

The key dissolved into mist, and the woman’s coat unraveled into a thousand drifting seeds. [603]
Elias reached out, but his fingers passed through her like smoke. [619]
*Wait—* he started, but she was already gone, leaving only the faintest glimmer of parole in the air, a promise that something had been exchanged. [654]

The lull returned, deeper this time, as if the library itself was holding its breath. [675]
Elias picked up the coin, feeling its warmth fade. [686]
He had come here to find the place where stories begin, but perhaps that place was never a location at all—just the moment before the first word is spoken, the silence before the ink touches the page. [731]
The bottled moonlight was gone, but its absence felt heavier than its presence ever had. [754]

He looked at the empty space where the bottle had been, then at the fading incision of his name on the counter. [779]
Maybe the trick wasn’t to find the beginning, but to recognize it when it found you. [799]
The chime sounded again, and this time, the door swung open wide, revealing not a customer, but the endless swirl of clouds beyond. [835]
Elias smiled. [838]
The story was starting again. [844]
