The lighthouse stood on a jagged spit of rock, its beam long dark, its purpose forgotten by all but the sea. [17]
Inside, Elias adjusted the gears of the doomsday clock, his fingers trembling not from the cold but from the weight of what he was about to do. [44]
The clock’s face was cracked, its hands frozen at three minutes to midnight—a time that had never been, yet always was. [72]
Elias had spent decades turning back its hands, not to stop the end, but to stretch the moment before it, to let the world breathe a little longer. [105]

On the table beside him lay the broken puppet head, its painted smile chipped, one glass eye missing. [126]
It had washed ashore years ago, tangled in seaweed, and Elias had kept it, though he couldn’t say why. [147]
Now, as dusk bled into the horizon, he understood: the puppet was a remnant of something beautiful and flawed, a thing that had once danced but now could only stare. [181]
It was like him. [184]

The pane of hush was propped against the wall, a sheet of glass so clear it seemed invisible until you pressed your palm to it and felt the silence hum beneath your skin. [224]
Elias had found it in the lighthouse’s cellar, buried under layers of salt and time. [240]
It didn’t just mute sound—it swallowed the echoes of what had been, what could have been, what would never be. [266]
He had spent years studying its nested patterns, the way the fractures in the glass spiraled into themselves, repeating endlessly. [290]
Through them, he had glimpsed other timelines, other versions of himself, all whispering the same question: *What if you let it end?* [322]

The final ripple of time lapped at the shore, a sound like a held breath. [338]
Elias knew what he had to do. [345]
He lifted the puppet head, its remaining eye catching the last light of the sun. [361]
If he vouchsafed his secret through the pane of hush, if he let the silence carry his voice across the nested patterns, he could whisper a lullaby across a thousand lifetimes. [399]
Not to save the world, but to soothe it. [410]

The doomsday clock ticked once, then stopped. [419]
Elias placed the puppet head against the pane of hush, its jagged edges fitting into the fractures like a key. [444]
The glass shivered, then sang—a note so pure it hurt. [460]
He began to hum, a melody his mother had sung to him as a child, a song about the sea giving back what it took. [491]
The sound didn’t travel through air; it seeped through the glass, through the nested patterns, through the hush of time itself. [521]

Outside, the waves stilled. [527]
The wind held its breath. [533]
The world leaned in, listening. [538]

Elias closed his eyes. [542]
The lighthouse beam flickered to life, not to warn, but to cradle. [560]
The doomsday clock’s hands dissolved into the dark, and for the first time in centuries, the world was quiet. [590]
Not silent—quiet, like a held hand, like a promise. [604]

The puppet head’s smile didn’t mend, but it softened, as if it had heard something it had waited its whole broken life to hear. [636]
Elias didn’t know if the lullaby would reach the right ears, the right hearts, the right moments. [662]
But he had done what he could. [671]
He had whispered into the hush, and the hush had answered. [685]

The last ripple of time settled into the sand, smooth as glass. [701]
Elias sat back, his hands steady now, his breath slow. [716]
The lighthouse hummed around him, a bruised awe filling the air, thick as salt. [737]
He didn’t know if the world would end tonight, or tomorrow, or never. [755]
But for now, the clock was still. [763]
The puppet head was smiling. [768]
And the sea, for once, was kind. [777]
