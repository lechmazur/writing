The brass sundial gleamed on the obsidian shelf, its surface atomically reflective under the pale light filtering through the tidal library’s crystalline domes. [19]
Lira adjusted the dial, her fingers brushing the engravings of creatures long extinct—her contemporaries, or so the reincarnation memory insisted. [43]
She had woken from that memory brittle, as if the weight of a thousand lives had settled into her bones overnight. [72]
The library, suspended above the clouds by some forgotten architect’s whim, was the only place where the hum of the ancient stone circle below resonated through the floors, a vibration that steadied her. [112]

She had come here to coexist with the past, not be consumed by it. [129]
The sundial was her anchor—a relic from the last era when her kind had walked the earth, its brass surface etched with the same constellations that had guided them. [162]
Lira traced the lines of a star map, the metal cool against her skin. [178]
The tidal library shifted beneath her, its shelves rising and falling with the rhythm of the tides far below, though no water touched this place. [210]

She had spent years translating isolation into independence, learning to stand apart from the ghosts of her lineage. [236]
The reincarnation memory had shown her the fall of her people, their cities swallowed by time, their voices lost to the wind. [266]
But here, among the books that floated like islands in the air, she had found a different kind of silence—one that didn’t demand answers, only patience. [299]

The hum of the stone circle grew louder, pulsing through the library’s foundation. [317]
Lira knelt, pressing her palm to the floor, feeling the vibration travel up her arm. [337]
It was the same frequency as the heartbeat of the world before, a rhythm her body remembered even if her mind did not. [371]

She had once tried to ignore it, to pretend the past was just a story. [391]
But the sundial had shown her otherwise. [402]
Its shadow had stretched across the shelf at the exact moment the memory first struck her, as if time itself had bent to mark the occasion. [436]

Now, she used it to measure more than hours. [448]
The sundial’s gnomon cast a shadow that pointed to the books she needed, the ones that whispered of her people’s language, their art, their last days. [480]
She had learned to read the patterns, to let the past guide her without letting it define her. [505]

The library’s curator, a wizened figure with eyes like polished river stones, had warned her. [527]
“Some memories are not meant to be carried alone,” they had said. [545]
But Lira had already learned that lesson. [555]
The reincarnation memory had fractured her, but it had also given her purpose. [576]

She turned the sundial, aligning its face with the light. [590]
The shadow shifted, pointing to a book bound in scales—her people’s lost script. [612]
She reached for it, her fingers trembling. [622]
The hum of the stone circle swelled, vibrating through the pages as she opened it. [645]

The words were not just ink. [652]
They were alive, shimmering like the atomically reflective surface of the sundial, rearranging themselves into a language she understood. [685]
She read aloud, her voice steady despite the weight of the moment. [705]

The library responded. [708]
The shelves rearranged, the books drifting toward her as if pulled by an unseen tide. [732]
She had spent years here, but this was the first time she felt the past and present coexist without conflict. [762]

The sundial’s shadow lengthened, marking the end of the cycle. [779]
Lira closed the book, her heart lighter than it had been in years. [797]
She had not erased her isolation, but she had translated it into something stronger. [817]
Independence, after all, was not the absence of the past—it was the choice to carry it forward. [842]
