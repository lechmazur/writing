The muralist, Liora Vey, stood in the heart of the ruined orchard district, her breath curling like smoke in the thick, century-old fog. [19]
Around her, skeletal apple trees stretched gnarled fingers toward a sky she couldn’t see, their branches heavy with the weight of forgotten seasons. [43]
She had come here not for the fruit—long since rotted away—but for the light, the way it slanted through the mist like liquid gold, painting the world in hues no brush could capture. [83]
Liora painted with light, her medium not pigment but exposure, her canvases sheets of film left to soak in the glow of dawn or dusk until the world burned itself into them. [124]

Her latest project was a fresco fragment, a sliver of plaster she’d salvaged from the crumbling wall of an old cider house. [151]
It bore the ghost of a painting: a child’s hand, reaching for an apple just out of grasp, the colors faded but the longing still sharp. [179]
She had found it half-buried in the mud, and something about it had lodged in her chest like a splinter. [202]
Perhaps it was the way the child’s fingers trembled on the edge of joy, or how the apple glowed as if lit from within. [228]
Liora wanted to bring it back to life—not as it was, but as it *felt*. [242]

She set up her camera on a tripod, the lens pointed at the fresco, and waited. [257]
The fog shifted, and for a moment, the light caught the fragment just right, turning the child’s hand translucent, as if the past were bleeding through. [290]
Liora adjusted the exposure, her fingers moving with the precision of someone who had spent years learning the language of light. [319]
She was part of a knowledge network, a loose collective of artists and historians who traded secrets like currency: how to coax color from shadow, how to make time visible. [354]
They had taught her that joy wasn’t something you found—it was something you uncovered, layer by layer, like stripping varnish from an old master. [387]

By midday, the fog had thinned enough to reveal the outlines of the district’s ruins: the husks of houses, the collapsed barns, the skeletal remains of what had once been a thriving community. [429]
Liora wandered among them, her boots sinking into the damp earth, and imagined the laughter of children, the clink of glasses, the rustle of leaves in a breeze that no longer blew. [468]
She wondered if the child in the fresco had ever known joy here, or if it had always been just out of reach, like the apple. [499]

That evening, she developed the film in a makeshift darkroom in the back of her van. [521]
The image emerged slowly, the chemicals swirling like the fog outside, revealing not just the fresco but the light that had passed through it. [554]
The child’s hand was no longer reaching—it was *holding* the apple, the fruit’s skin glistening as if wet with dew. [582]
And in the background, faint but unmistakable, was the shadow of a tree, its branches heavy with fruit. [610]
Liora’s breath caught. [613]
She had not just captured the fresco; she had captured the moment *before* the joy was lost. [642]

The next morning, she returned to the orchard district with the print in hand. [662]
She pinned it to the same wall where she’d found the fresco, the image glowing in the morning light. [689]
A few other artists from the knowledge network had gathered, drawn by word of her discovery, and they stood in silence as the fog curled around their ankles. [729]
One of them, an old woman with ink-stained fingers, reached out and touched the edge of the print. [755]
“You didn’t just display it,” she said. “You gave it back its joy.” [773]

Liora smiled, the weight in her chest lifting like the fog burning away. [790]
For the first time in years, she felt the apple within reach. [803]
