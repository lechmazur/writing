The mountain loomed like a forgotten god, its slopes carved into shelves of books that spiraled upward in impossible geometry. [17]
Elias had spent three years navigating its labyrinthine corridors, each turn a whisper of paper and ink, each dead end a promise of something just beyond reach. [45]
He was the mercury-glass seer, though no one had called him that in decades—not since the visions had begun substituting reality nightly, leaving his waking hours a patchwork of truths he could no longer trust. [89]

It started with the dreams. [93]
Not the soft, drifting kind, but the ones that clawed at his ribs, leaving him gasping in the narrow cot above the bookstore’s rare manuscripts section. [126]
In them, he saw a stone, smooth and black, humming with a language that made his teeth ache. [146]
The lost language stone, though he didn’t know its name then—only that it called to him, its voice a thread pulling taut between his ribs. [178]

The bookstore’s owner, an old woman with fingers like brittle twigs, found him one morning curled around a feather. [202]
It was no ordinary feather—its barbs shimmered with the same opalescent sheen as the mercury in his veins, the same substance that pooled in his irises when the visions took hold. [234]
“You’re seeding something,” she said, her voice like dry leaves skittering across stone. [250]
Elias didn’t answer. [253]
He had pressed the feather to his wrist and felt the world tilt, the labyrinth’s walls breathing in time with his pulse. [282]

His motivation was simple, though he couldn’t articulate it then: to understand the shape of home. [303]
Not the mountain, not the bookstore, but the place where the stone waited, where the feather’s texture could unravel the knots in his memory. [335]
After remembering becomes painful, you don’t stop—you dig deeper. [347]

He began with the books. [351]
Not the ones on the shelves, but the ones hidden in the mountain’s heart, where the air smelled of damp earth and old magic. [372]
There, he found a journal written in a script that made his eyes water, its pages filled with sketches of the stone and a single, recurring phrase: *buried talents*. [409]
The words slithered into his skin, and for the first time in years, he felt something like hope. [436]

The feather was the key. [441]
He learned this when he pressed it to the journal’s spine and watched the ink rearrange itself, forming a map of the mountain’s veins. [471]
The stone wasn’t just lost—it was buried, and not by time or accident, but by someone who had feared what it could reveal. [504]
Elias traced the path with his fingertip, the feather’s texture guiding him like a divining rod. [528]

The descent was worse than the dreams. [534]
The deeper he went, the more reality frayed at the edges, the mercury in his blood surging in response. [560]
Stairs became tunnels, tunnels became mouths, and the air thickened with the weight of forgotten things. [588]
He clutched the feather tighter, its barbs pricking his palm, and thought of home—not as a place, but as a shape, something he could hold in his hands if he just reached far enough. [632]

The stone was there, nestled in the roots of the mountain like a second heart. [650]
When he touched it, the language flooded him, not in words but in sensation: the taste of rain on stone, the sound of a door closing for the last time, the ache of a talent buried too deep to ever bloom. [699]
It wasn’t just his talent—it was everyone’s, the ones who had walked these shelves and left pieces of themselves behind. [731]

The feather dissolved in his grip, its texture unraveling into threads of light that seeped into the stone. [756]
The mountain sighed, its walls shifting, the labyrinth rearranging itself into something new. [778]
Elias understood then: home wasn’t a place to return to, but a shape to carve from the raw material of memory. [806]
And the thunder he’d always heard wasn’t hidden—it was waiting to be named. [824]
