The alchemical orchard greenhouse stood at the edge of the winter-cracked fields, its glass panes frosted with silver breath, as if the night itself had exhaled upon them. [23]
Inside, the air hummed with the scent of dormant blossoms and the faint metallic tang of old magic, a place where time moved differently—slower, thicker, like honey dripping from a spoon. [55]
Liora knelt among the roots of a gnarled apple tree, her fingers brushing the soil, searching. [75]
She had come here every winter solstice for seven years, though she could not remember why, only that the debt gnawed at her like a rat in the walls of her ribs. [110]

A whisper slithered through the greenhouse, soft as a lover’s sigh. [123]
Liora turned to see the ashen-veil ghost bride standing between the rows of sleeping trees, her form woven from moonlight and mist. [148]
The bride’s gown was the color of old bones, her veil a shifting curtain of smoke that never quite settled. [170]
She did not speak, but her presence was a weight, a promise, a wound that refused to close. [190]

Liora’s breath hitched. [193]
She had seen the bride before—always in fleeting glimpses, always at the edge of vision, like a name on the tip of her tongue. [222]
This time, the ghost bride extended a skeletal hand, and in her palm rested a carved stone bead, its surface etched with spirals that seemed to pulse when Liora looked too long. [258]
The bead was warm, though the greenhouse was cold enough to see her breath. [275]

“You gave this to me,” Liora murmured, though she had no memory of it. [290]
The bride’s lips parted, but no sound came—only the echo of a voice that might have been Liora’s own, if her throat had been filled with thorns. [321]
The bead hummed in her palm, a resonant awakening, a key turning in a lock she hadn’t known was there. [347]

Liora’s hands trembled. [351]
She had spent lifetimes running from this place, from this debt, from the woman who now watched her with eyes like dying stars. [382]
The bride had been her sister, once, or her lover, or perhaps both—memory was a frayed tapestry here, threads unraveling at the touch. [415]
But the bead was proof, wasn’t it? Proof that something had been taken, something had been broken, and that the breaking had been lovingly venomous, a wound given with a kiss. [454]

The greenhouse groaned around them, the glass panes trembling as if the night itself were holding its breath. [480]
Liora closed her fingers around the bead, and the world tilted. [494]
She saw herself in another life, standing in this same orchard, her hands stained with something dark and wet. [521]
The bride—younger then, alive—had begged her to stop, but Liora had not listened. [543]
The debt was born in that moment, a seed planted in blood and regret. [563]

Now, the ghost bride watched her through ephemeral cameo appearances, a specter of what could have been, what should have been. [595]
Liora’s chest ached with mournful elation, the kind of joy that tastes like tears. [614]
She had spent so long trying to outrun the past, but the past had always been here, waiting in the hush of winter-cracked fields, in the quiet hum of the alchemical orchard. [652]

The bead grew warmer, its spirals glowing faintly, as if feeding on her sorrow. [673]
Liora understood then—this was the repayment. [685]
Not gold, not favors, but the weight of remembering, the burden of knowing. [705]
The bride’s veil shimmered, and for a moment, Liora saw her smile, a thing of terrible beauty. [728]

Then she was gone, leaving only the bead behind, its warmth seeping into Liora’s skin like a second heartbeat. [752]
The greenhouse sighed, the trees rustling as if in relief. [765]
Liora pressed the bead to her lips, tasting salt and old magic. [780]
The debt was repaid, but the wound remained—lovingly venomous, forever open. [797]
