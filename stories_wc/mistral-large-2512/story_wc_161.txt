The attic of *Holloway’s Folio* smelled of yellowed paper and slow decay, a scent Elias had come to associate with both ruin and resurrection. [19]
He balanced on the warped floorboards, his fingers tracing the spines of forgotten books like a blind man reading braille. [40]
Above him, a single skylight cast a pale rectangle on the dust, and within that light, motes swirled in lazy orbits—each one a tiny world, each path a story waiting to be mapped. [78]
Elias had spent the last three months charting their movements, convinced that if he could predict their patterns, he might predict something larger: the shape of his own fractured past. [118]

He was a courier pigeon trainer by trade, or so he told people. [132]
The truth was messier. [135]
Once, he had been a musicologist, tracking the origins of folk songs that vanished like smoke from a snuffed candle. [159]
But after the fire—after the archives burned and the last known recordings of the *Lament of the Hollow Men* turned to ash—he had reinvented his personal history, burying the scholar beneath the simpler identity of a man who trained birds to carry messages. [207]
It was easier than admitting he had failed to preserve the echo of lost songs. [223]

The mars meteorite chip sat in a velvet-lined box on his desk, a jagged sliver of rust-red stone no larger than a thumbnail. [248]
He had won it in a card game from a geologist who swore it was older than Earth itself. [265]
Elias kept it as a reminder: even the most distant things could find their way home. [282]
Now, as he watched the dust motes spiral, he wondered if the same was true for people. [299]

The paper trails had led him here. [306]
Not the literal kind—though the attic was buried in them—but the kind that snaked through lives: receipts, letters, marginalia in books. [336]
A week ago, he’d found a water-stained ledger tucked behind a false panel, its pages filled with coded entries. [358]
The handwriting matched the notes in his old research files, the ones he’d thought were destroyed. [376]
Someone had been tracking the same songs he had. [389]

The door creaked open. [395]
Lena stepped inside, her boots kicking up fresh dust. [407]
She was the bookshop’s owner, a woman who spoke in quotes and wore her skepticism like armor. [428]
“You’re still up here,” she said, not unkindly. [437]
Elias didn’t turn. [440]
“Still mapping,” he replied. [444]
She crossed the room, her shadow cutting through the skylight’s glow. [458]
“You know, most people use graphs for that.” [469]
“Graphs don’t breathe.” [473]

She picked up the meteorite chip, rolling it between her fingers. [486]
“What’s this, then?” [490]
“Proof that some things survive.” [498]
Lena set it down. [502]
“Or that some things are just lucky.” [511]
Elias finally looked at her. [516]
Her face was all sharp angles, but her eyes were soft in the way of things that had learned to trust again. [542]

He told her about the ledger. [549]
About the songs. [553]
About the fire. [557]
She listened without interrupting, the way people do when they’re deciding whether to believe you. [582]
When he finished, she reached into her pocket and pulled out a folded sheet of paper. [601]
“Found this in a first edition of *The Golden Bough*,” she said. [619]
It was a lyric sheet, the ink faded but legible: the first verse of the *Lament*. [640]

Elias’s hands trembled. [645]
“Where did you—?” [650]
“Same place you found the ledger, probably.” [663]
She hesitated. [666]
“There’s more. [669]
The shop’s previous owner left a note. [681]
He was collecting them too.” [689]

The dust motes swirled faster, as if stirred by an unseen breath. [706]
Elias understood then: the attic wasn’t just a hiding place. [722]
It was a crossroads. [726]
A place where paper trails converged, where lost things waited to be found. [745]

Lena watched him, her expression unreadable. [754]
“You could keep running,” she said. [762]
“Or you could stay. [767]
Help me piece it together.” [776]

Outside, a pigeon cooed on the windowsill, its wings ruffling in the evening breeze. [797]
Elias reached for the meteorite chip, turning it in the light. [810]
Some things survived. [814]
Some things found their way home. [823]
He made his choice. [827]
[828]
