The bluff hummed, a low vibration that rose from the earth and into Elias’s bones. [13]
He had come here, to this whispering ledge above the clouds, because the world below had forgotten how to speak. [33]
Words had become unnecessary long ago, but the silence was not empty—it was full of sound, if one knew how to listen. [58]
Elias did. [60]

As the seasonally mute bell tuner, his voice had always been a fragile thing, fading with the first frost and returning only when the thaw softened the earth. [91]
Now, even that cyclical whisper was gone, swallowed by the great hush that had settled over humanity. [115]
But the bells remained. [118]
And the bells remembered. [121]

He knelt beside his latest creation, a kinetic sculpture of spun silver and hollow reeds, its arms poised to catch the wind. [146]
The iceberg fragment lay at its center, a jagged shard no larger than his palm, its surface glistening with the last light of dusk. [174]
It had been carried here by a storm, plucked from some distant sea and deposited on the bluff like an offering. [197]
Elias had found it three days ago, half-buried in the frost. [209]
Its cold bit into his fingers now as he adjusted the sculpture’s balance, ensuring the fragment would pivot just so when the wind rose. [240]

The symphonies of truth were not played—they were *uncovered*. [250]
That was what his mentor, old Veyra, had taught him before the silence took her too. [268]
"Listen," she’d signed with her hands, her breath fogging in the winter air. [282]
"The world is a bell. You don’t make it ring. You tune it until it remembers its own song." [304]

Elias exhaled, his breath curling into the twilight. [313]
The sculpture was ready. [316]
He stepped back, watching as the first gust of night wind set the reeds trembling. [335]
The iceberg fragment spun, catching the light, and for a heartbeat, the bluff was alive with refracted color—blues and greens and a sliver of violet, the hues of wonder preserved in frozen water. [376]
The sculpture sang. [379]
Not a melody, not quite, but a resonance, deep and true, like the note of a bell that had been waiting centuries to be heard. [413]

Below the clouds, the world slept. [420]
Or perhaps it had simply stopped pretending. [428]
Elias didn’t know. [431]
He only knew that the colors were fading, not just in the sky or the sea, but in the eyes of those who still walked the earth. [462]
Wonder was a language too, and it was being lost. [476]

The sculpture’s song faded as the wind stilled. [487]
Elias knelt again, brushing his fingers over the iceberg fragment. [501]
It was smaller now, melting into the silver. [510]
He would need another. [514]

The next morning, he descended the bluff, his boots crunching on frost. [532]
The village below was a cluster of silent homes, their chimneys cold, their doors ajar as if inviting the wind to come inside. [563]
No one spoke. [566]
No one needed to. [570]

He found what he was looking for near the old well—a child’s abandoned toy, a glass orb filled with swirling blue liquid. [599]
It glistened in the pale sunlight. [607]
Elias pocketed it. [610]
The colors inside were bright, untouched by the world’s fading. [627]
He would break it open. [632]
The sculpture would drink the blue. [638]

As he climbed back to the bluff, the wind picked up, carrying the scent of snow. [657]
Winter was coming early this year. [665]
Elias would be mute again soon. [672]
But the bells would keep singing. [678]
And the colors would remain. [684]

He reached the sculpture and placed the glass orb at its heart. [699]
The wind did the rest. [704]
The orb shattered. [707]
Blue liquid spilled across the iceberg fragment, freezing instantly into a lattice of sapphire and cerulean. [730]
The sculpture trembled, then sang—a note higher, brighter, a symphony of truth woven from silence and light. [758]

Elias closed his eyes. [763]
Somewhere below the clouds, a child would see the colors and remember. [783]
And the world would not forget. [791]
Not yet. [793]
