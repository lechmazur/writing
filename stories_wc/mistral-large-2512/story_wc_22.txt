The blooming jetty at twilight was the only place where the air still carried the scent of salt and something older, something like damp earth after rain. [19]
Elias, the gloom-hill coachman, stood at its edge, his boots sinking slightly into the weathered wood, the planks groaning under his weight as if they, too, remembered the reef that had once teemed with life before the dying. [56]
In his hands, he cradled a collection of dried seed pods, their papery husks brittle with age, their contents rattling faintly like whispers from a forgotten tongue. [89]
He had gathered them over years, plucking them from the skeletal remains of gardens long abandoned, where the soil had turned to dust and the wind carried only the echoes of what had been. [130]

Elias spoke dead languages—not the kind found in books, but the ones that lingered in the silence between things. [155]
The creak of the jetty, the sigh of the tide, the distant cry of a gull—each was a word in a conversation that had been going on for centuries, and he had learned to listen. [188]
It was how he had discovered the submerged concord, the quiet agreement between the earth and the sea that the reef’s death had shattered. [217]
The water had once been alive with color, with the hum of life, but now it was a mirror reflecting only the sky’s emptiness, a vastness so narrow it felt like a wound. [253]

He had come to fertilize. [256]
Not the soil—there was no soil left here, only the stubborn persistence of the jetty’s wildflowers, their roots clawing through the cracks in the wood. [287]
No, he meant to fertilize the idea of return, the possibility that what had been lost could, in some small way, be reclaimed. [315]
The battlefield had been here, long ago, though no one spoke of it now. [330]
The jetty had been built over its bones, the planks laid where men had once bled into the earth, where the ground had drunk its fill and then forgotten. [361]
Elias knew because the dead told him, in their way. [373]
The wind carried their voices when it blew from the north, and he had learned to understand bird calls as if they were prayers. [399]

A heron landed on the railing beside him, its feathers ruffled by the evening breeze. [418]
Elias tilted his head, listening. [424]
The bird’s call was low, almost mournful, but beneath it was something else—a question, or perhaps an invitation. [450]
He nodded, as if in answer, and scattered a handful of the seed pods onto the jetty. [470]
They tumbled into the cracks, settling into the dark where the wood met the water, where the memories of the battlefield still clung like damp. [499]

The heron watched, then took flight, its wings beating the air into something like a promise. [522]
Elias stayed, his breath shallow, his fingers brushing the remaining pods in his palm. [541]
He had no illusions about what he was doing. [550]
The reef was dead, the battlefield was a ghost, and the world had moved on. [567]
But the garden—ah, the garden was stubborn. [576]
It would creep back if given the chance, if someone bothered to listen to the language of decay and renewal. [601]

Twilight deepened, the sky bleeding into the water until there was no distinction between them. [621]
Elias spoke then, not to the dead, but to the living that remained—the flowers, the heron, the seeds waiting in the dark. [646]
His words were not in any tongue that could be written, but they were understood. [666]
The jetty groaned again, softer this time, as if in reply. [681]

He turned to leave, his steps slow, his shadow stretching long behind him. [699]
The collection of seed pods was lighter now, but his heart was not. [715]
He had done what he could. [722]
The rest was up to the earth, and the earth, he knew, was patient. [739]

The blooming jetty would remember. [745]
And one day, so would the battlefield. [755]
