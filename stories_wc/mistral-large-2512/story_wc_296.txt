The druid stood at the edge of the cursed lake, her boots sinking into the frost-rimed mud. [14]
Around her, the swirling orchard vortex pulsed like a living thing, its gnarled branches twisting in slow, deliberate spirals. [32]
She had come here not by choice, but because the magic trick had failed—her last attempt to mend the rift between the forest and the encroaching city. [61]
Now, the land itself seemed to hold its breath, waiting for her next move. [76]

Her name was Veyra, though few knew it. [85]
The druids of the Blackthorn Circle called her the Keeper of Lost Things, not as a title, but as a warning. [106]
She found what others could not—secrets buried in roots, memories trapped in stone, truths that refused to stay hidden. [128]
But today, she sought something far more dangerous: what mirrors did not show. [145]
Not her reflection, not the scars that mapped her arms like rivers of old battles, but the thing beneath them—the frozen confession she had carried for decades. [173]

The lake’s surface rippled, though no wind stirred. [183]
At its heart, the vortex groaned, its branches heavy with fruit that glistened like wet teeth. [202]
Veyra reached into her satchel and withdrew the seed—a flesh-eating plant, its pod swollen with promise. [220]
The Circle had given it to her as a test, a way to prove her loyalty. [235]
"Feed it the untruths of the world," they had said, "and it will grow strong enough to devour the curse." [256]
But she knew better. [260]
The seed was a lie detector, a thing that thrived on honesty as much as flesh. [275]
And if she planted it here, in the belly of the vortex, it would demand the one truth she had never spoken. [296]

She knelt, pressing her fingers into the frozen earth. [305]
The cold bit through her gloves, but she did not flinch. [316]
Warlike serenity—that was the only way to survive this place. [329]
The vortex had taken her mentor years ago, swallowed him whole when he tried to unbend its will. [349]
She had watched from the shore, too young to help, too afraid to look away. [365]
Now, she would do what he could not. [375]

The seed pulsed in her palm, warm despite the frost. [386]
She dug a shallow hole and placed it inside, whispering the old words of binding. [403]
The earth trembled. [406]
The branches above her creaked, bending lower, as if listening. [422]
Then, the seed split. [427]
A tendril snaked out, thin as a thread, and latched onto her wrist. [443]
Pain flared, sharp and bright, but she did not pull away. [455]
The plant was testing her, tasting her skin, her blood, her memories. [470]
Through expanding circles, it would unravel her—layer by layer, lie by lie—until it found the core. [491]

She gritted her teeth. [495]
The first memory came unbidden: the night she had failed to save the village. [512]
The raiders had come at dawn, and she had been too slow, too hesitant. [529]
The plant drank it in, its tendrils writhing. [540]
Then, the second: the moment she had chosen the forest over the child who begged for help. [562]
The tendrils tightened. [565]
The third: the frozen confession, the one she had never spoken aloud. [580]
"I let them die," she whispered. [586]
The words hung in the air, brittle as ice. [595]

The plant stilled. [598]
The vortex groaned, its branches shuddering as if struck. [612]
Then, the lake began to thaw. [618]
The ice cracked, revealing dark water beneath, and in its depths, something glinted—a mirror, not of glass, but of polished bone. [646]
It showed her not her face, but the truth she had buried: the raiders had been her kin, exiled for crimes she had helped commit. [679]
She had known. [682]
She had always known. [687]

The plant released her, its work done. [696]
The seed had grown into a sapling, its leaves black as old blood. [712]
Veyra stood, her hands trembling. [719]
The mirror in the lake did not reflect her anymore. [730]
It showed the child she had abandoned, now grown, standing at the edge of the forest with a knife in hand. [755]
"Next time," the child said, "I won’t ask for help." [770]

The vortex sighed, its branches unwinding. [778]
The curse was lifting, but not in the way the Circle had hoped. [792]
Veyra had found what mirrors did not show. [801]
And now, she would have to live with it. [811]
