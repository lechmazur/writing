The iridescent cave hummed with the quiet song of light refracted through its giant crystal walls, each facet catching the dim glow of bioluminescent algae like a thousand tiny moons. [23]
Liora, the sea-foam recollectionist, knelt in the center of the geode, her fingers brushing the cool, smooth surface of the crater glass she had found half-buried in the cave’s floor. [53]
It was a shard of something larger, a fragment of a meteorite that had struck the earth long before the cave had formed, its edges still sharp despite the ages it had spent embedded in the crystal. [91]
She held it up to the light, watching as the emotions she transliterated—her own and others’—danced across its surface in swirling hues of blue and gold. [122]
Today, the glass showed her a path, one that had once been clear but now flickered like a dying ember. [143]

Liora had come to this cave before memory faded, before the details of her purpose blurred into the mist of time. [168]
She was a collector of lost things, not just objects but moments, decisions, the quiet turns of fate that led people to places they never expected. [194]
The crater glass was her latest find, and it whispered of missing pieces—of choices made and unmade, of roads taken and abandoned. [220]
She had followed the trail of scattered seeds dropped by a migrating bird, their tiny imprints leading her here, to this cave where the air itself seemed to hold its breath. [253]

The seeds had been a clue, she conjectured, though she couldn’t say why. [267]
Perhaps the bird had carried them from some distant place where the path she sought was still whole, where the missing pieces had not yet been lost. [298]
Liora closed her eyes and let the emotions she had gathered over the years wash over her—the joy of discovery, the sorrow of loss, the quiet resolve to keep searching. [335]
The cave responded, its walls shimmering as if in agreement, the light bending to her will. [354]

She stood, the crater glass clutched in her palm, and walked toward the back of the cave where the crystal walls narrowed into a tunnel. [382]
The tunnel was dark, but the glass in her hand glowed faintly, casting long shadows that seemed to reach for her. [410]
Liora hesitated. [412]
She had spent her life chasing the answer to one question: why do some paths disappear? [437]
Was it fate? [440]
A trick of the mind? [445]
Or something more deliberate, like the hand of time erasing what it no longer needed? [470]

The tunnel led her deeper into the geode, the air growing thicker, the light dimmer. [492]
The crater glass pulsed in her grip, its colors shifting from blue to violet, then to a deep, unsettling red. [519]
She stopped. [522]
The glass was showing her something new—an emotion she didn’t recognize, something raw and aching, like a wound that had never healed. [557]

Liora exhaled, her breath fogging the air. [566]
She had always believed that missing pieces were meant to be found, that nothing was truly lost, only waiting. [593]
But what if some paths disappeared because they were never meant to be walked? [617]
What if the missing pieces were never meant to be whole? [634]

The cave seemed to sigh around her, the walls trembling faintly as if in response. [655]
The crater glass grew heavier in her hand, its light flickering like a candle in the wind. [678]
Liora smiled, though her heart ached. [688]
This was the nature of her work—the cheerful gloom of knowing that some things were meant to remain mysteries, that some paths were meant to fade. [726]
She turned the glass over in her palm, watching as the strange emotion dissolved into something softer, something like acceptance. [756]

The tunnel ended abruptly, opening into a small chamber where the crystal walls met in a perfect, unbroken dome. [785]
At its center lay a single seed, untouched by time, its surface gleaming like polished obsidian. [812]
Liora knelt and picked it up, feeling its weight, its promise. [829]
Perhaps this was the answer—or at least, the beginning of one. [846]
She tucked the seed into her pocket alongside the crater glass and turned back toward the light. [870]
The path behind her was still there, but it no longer called to her in the same way. [893]
Some pieces were meant to stay missing. [904]
And that, she decided, was all right. [912]
