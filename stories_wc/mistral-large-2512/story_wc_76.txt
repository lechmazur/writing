The lighthouse stood crooked on the black teeth of the island, its beam a dying breath against the storm. [14]
Elias Voss, clockmaker of the counter-clockwise persuasion, had come here not for the light, but for the silence it guarded. [34]
The hunger stone lay half-buried in the tide’s slow exhale, its surface etched with names of those who had starved before the sea relented. [61]
He traced the grooves with his thumb, feeling the latent radiance hum beneath—the same energy that made his clocks run backward, that made time itself stutter in their presence. [90]

The yoyo had washed ashore three nights prior, its wood warm as a living thing. [106]
Neatly inventive, Elias thought, turning it in his hands. [114]
The mechanism was unlike any he’d seen: not a spool, but a series of nested gears, each smaller than the last, designed to unwind in a spiral. [138]
He had spent the last two days reverse-engineering it, his tools spread across the lighthouse’s damp floor, the salt air corroding the brass before he could finish. [167]

The tide was lowest now, the rocks slick with kelp and the ghosts of drowned sailors. [182]
Elias knew what he had to do. [188]
To step beyond fate’s design, he would have to initiate something the world wasn’t ready for. [208]
He wound the yoyo’s string around his finger, feeling the gears click into place like vertebrae. [226]

The first time he dropped it, the yoyo didn’t fall—it *rose*. [238]
A slow, deliberate ascent, as if gravity had been a suggestion all along. [253]
Elias caught it, heart hammering, and wound it again. [262]
This time, he let it go longer. [268]
The yoyo spiraled upward, higher and higher, until it vanished into the lighthouse’s beam, a star swallowed by the dark. [292]

Then the hunger stone began to glow. [300]
Not with fire, but with the same latent radiance Elias had felt in his clocks, in the yoyo, in the marrow of his own bones. [325]
The names carved into its surface shimmered, then faded, as if the stone had forgotten them. [343]
Elias understood. [346]
This was no mere relic—it was a key, and the yoyo was the lock. [360]

He wound the yoyo one last time and dropped it straight down. [373]
It plummeted, then stopped midair, hovering like a hummingbird before the stone. [388]
The gears inside it spun wildly, and for a moment, Elias thought he heard a chorus of voices—drowned, desperate, hungry. [416]
Then the yoyo *unwound*. [421]
Not its string, but its very shape, the wood peeling back like petals to reveal a core of black glass. [446]
The glass pulsed, and the hunger stone split open. [457]

A light poured out, not golden, but the color of old bruises, of things left too long in the dark. [479]
It wrapped around Elias, seeping into his skin, his veins, his bones. [493]
He gasped as the world *reversed*. [500]
The tide rushed inward, the lighthouse groaned backward, the storm clouds unraveled into clear sky. [520]
And then—silence. [523]

Elias stood on the rocks, but the hunger stone was whole again, its surface blank. [542]
The yoyo lay at his feet, ordinary now, its gears still. [554]
He picked it up, turning it in his hands, and for the first time in his life, he felt the weight of time not as a chain, but as a choice. [585]

The lighthouse’s beam flickered, then steadied, casting its light not forward, but *backward*. [605]
Elias smiled, bleak and exhilarated. [611]
He had stepped beyond fate’s design. [618]
Now he would see what lay on the other side. [630]

The tide began to rise again, but slower this time, as if the sea itself was holding its breath. [652]
Elias wound the yoyo once more, just to be sure. [664]
This time, when he dropped it, it fell. [673]
But the hunger stone remembered. [680]
And so did he. [685]
