The workshop hummed beneath a sky where stars blinked out one by one, their absence leaving gaps like missing teeth in the cosmos. [18]
Elias Veyne, the letterpress operator, stood at his press, fingers stained with ink that smelled of old parchment and copper. [37]
He had spent the last three nights setting type for a book no one would read, its pages filled with equations that mapped the weight of sorrow, the velocity of joy. [73]
The workshop, a domed structure of topaz glass, refracted the dying starlight into fractured rainbows that pooled on the floor like liquid gold. [103]

A halo fragment rested on the corner of his workbench, its edges jagged as if torn from something larger. [125]
Elias had found it embedded in the spine of a book titled *The Geometry of Grief*, its pages warped by something that wasn’t water. [150]
He didn’t know what the fragment was, only that it hummed when he touched it, a sound like a choir tuning itself in a language without vowels. [178]

His motivation was simple: to understand the mathematics of emotion. [192]
Not the messy, human kind—the kind that could be plotted on a graph, where love was a parabola and despair a descending asymptote. [221]
But the equations kept slipping, their variables refusing to hold still. [235]
That was the problem with transposed empathy: the feelings didn’t belong to him, yet they anchored themselves to his ribs like barnacles. [258]

Elias habitually borrowed personalities, slipping into them as easily as a hand into a glove. [275]
Tonight, he wore the skin of a poet who had drowned in his own metaphors, his thoughts drifting like smoke. [298]
The poet’s words spilled from Elias’s mouth, unbidden: *"The stars are not dying—they are being unremembered."* [323]
He didn’t know what it meant, but the phrase disoriented him, made the workshop tilt like a ship in a storm. [347]

He reached for the halo fragment, its surface cool against his fingertips. [362]
The hum grew louder, vibrating through his bones until his teeth ached. [379]
Deliberate ambiguity was his method—he never explained, never clarified, because to name a thing was to kill it. [406]
The poet’s voice faded, replaced by the dry precision of a mathematician who had spent her life calculating the exact moment the universe would end. [442]
*"If emotion is a function,"* she murmured through Elias’s lips, *"then its derivative is suffering."* [465]

The topaz walls pulsed with light, the refracted stars spinning into spirals. [482]
Elias’s hands moved on their own, setting type for an equation he didn’t understand: *∂f/∂t = -k(1 - f²)*. [508]
It looked like a predator’s grin. [515]

A knock at the workshop door. [521]
Elias didn’t answer. [524]
The door creaked open anyway, revealing a woman in a coat the color of burnt sugar. [545]
She stepped inside, her boots silent on the glass floor. [558]
*"You’re not the first to try this,"* she said, nodding at the halo fragment. [577]
*"But you might be the last."* [584]

Elias borrowed her voice before she could finish, her words twisting into something darker: *"Empathy isn’t a bridge—it’s a theft."* [615]
The woman’s eyes widened. [621]
The workshop trembled. [624]
The halo fragment glowed, its light seeping into the ink on the press, turning the equations into living things. [651]

The mathematician’s voice returned, sharp and final: *"The universe doesn’t care about your feelings. It only cares about the numbers."* [688]
Elias’s borrowed personalities unraveled like thread, leaving him hollow, a vessel for something else. [712]
The woman reached for the fragment, but it dissolved into smoke at her touch. [732]

The last star vanished. [737]
The workshop went dark. [742]
Elias stood alone, his fingers still stained with ink, his mind quiet for the first time in years. [766]
He didn’t know if he had succeeded or failed. [777]
All he knew was that the equations were still there, waiting to be solved. [796]
