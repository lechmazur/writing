The tower stood silent against the paling sky, its stones whispering secrets only the wind could carry. [14]
Elias had come here for the quiet, for the way dawn softened the edges of memory, but the hourglass on the windowsill refused to let him forget. [44]
Its sand was frosted, not golden, each grain catching the light like shattered glass. [63]
He had found it in the ruins of the old chapel, buried beneath a collapsed pew, and though he didn’t know why, he had taken it. [93]

The anesthesia had worn off hours ago, leaving behind a dull ache in his ribs and a clarity that felt like a betrayal. [124]
He pressed his palm to the cold stone of the sill, watching his breath fog the air. [142]
Somewhere below, the garden slept, but Elias could hear it anyway—the creak of stems, the sigh of leaves settling. [167]
He had always been like this, accidentally telepathic with plants, though he’d never told anyone. [186]
It was easier to pretend the rustling was just the wind. [199]

The hourglass had no markings, no way to tell how long it measured. [216]
He turned it over, watching the sand spill in a slow, glittering cascade. [233]
His mother’s voice came back to him, soft and distant: *"Some miracles don’t belong where they land."* [255]
She had been talking about the scar on his wrist, the one he’d gotten falling through a greenhouse roof when he was eight. [280]
The glass had sliced him open, but the plants had reached for him, their vines curling around his fingers like they meant to pull him back. [312]

Elias traced the scar now, the raised skin pale in the dim light. [330]
He had spent years trying to read the stories in scars, his own and others’. [348]
The old woman at the market who sold lavender had a burn on her forearm shaped like a crow in flight. [369]
The blacksmith’s son bore a jagged line across his palm from a plowshare, a wound that had never quite closed. [392]
Elias wondered what his own scars said about him—if they were maps or warnings. [414]

The hourglass ran out. [421]
He turned it again, but the sand didn’t fall. [435]
A crack spiderwebbed across the glass, thin and bright. [450]
Outside, the first true light of dawn touched the tower’s peak, and the garden below shuddered awake. [474]
Elias heard it—the gasp of roots shifting, the groan of branches stretching toward the sun. [498]
He closed his eyes and let the voices in. [510]

*"You’re late,"* the roses whispered. *"We’ve been waiting."* [526]
*"The others are gone,"* sighed the ivy. *"Only you remember."* [543]
Elias exhaled, his breath unsteady. [554]
He had come here for closure, but the tower had other plans. [571]

At the base of the garden, half-hidden by overgrowth, was the entrance to a tunnel. [593]
He hadn’t noticed it before. [601]
The air inside was cool and damp, smelling of earth and old stone. [620]
His fingers brushed the wall, and the moss there hummed, low and mournful. [640]
*"Turn back,"* it said. *"This isn’t your story."* [657]

Elias kept walking. [663]
The tunnel sloped downward, the darkness thickening until he had to press his palm to the ceiling to keep his bearings. [693]
Then, light—a faint, greenish glow, like moonlight through leaves. [715]
He rounded a bend and stopped. [723]

The tunnel opened into a chamber, its walls lined with hourglasses, hundreds of them, their sand frozen mid-fall. [753]
At the center of the room stood a pedestal, and on it, a single cup of cold coffee. [775]
The rings on its surface were perfect, concentric circles, each one a story waiting to be read. [799]

Elias stepped closer. [804]
The coffee was still wet. [811]
Someone had been here moments ago. [820]
He touched the rim of the cup, and the hourglasses around him began to shatter, one by one, their sand spilling onto the floor in glittering waves. [853]
The tower groaned above him, the sound like a held breath finally released. [875]

Elias understood then. [880]
The miracle hadn’t been lost. [886]
It had been displaced, waiting for someone who knew how to listen. [906]
He turned the cup in his hands, reading the stories in the rings, and for the first time in years, the scars on his skin didn’t ache. [940]
