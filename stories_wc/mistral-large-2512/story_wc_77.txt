The funhouse mirrors still held the ghost of laughter, their silvered surfaces warped by decades of neglect, yet somehow luminous in the dim. [22]
Elias adjusted the opera cloak clasp at his throat—a tarnished silver thing shaped like a weeping eye—and stepped over a collapsed ticket booth, its wood splintered like broken teeth. [55]
The air smelled of rust and caramelized sugar, a repulsive allure that clung to the back of his throat. [75]
Behind him, the whispering advisor trailed like a draft, her voice a threadbare murmur: *"Fear is a coward, Elias. It hides in the dark, but it always leaves a trail of light."* [108]

He had come here after the resuscitation, when the doctors had pulled him back from the edge of something worse than death—a place where the world blurred into static, where his own reflection had begun to move without him. [149]
The photographically cursed Polaroid in his pocket had captured that moment: a man with no face, only a smear of silver where his features should have been. [178]
He’d burned the photo, but the image lingered in his mind, a lingering luminance that pulsed behind his eyes whenever he blinked. [205]

The funhouse’s hall of mirrors stretched before him, a labyrinth of distorted glass. [219]
Elias unbosomed his deepest dread—that he was already hollow, a vessel for something that wasn’t him—and the mirrors seemed to ripple in response, their reflections stretching and snapping like elastic. [260]
The whispering advisor’s breath tickled his ear: *"Fear’s weakness is curiosity. It can’t resist being seen."* [282]

He reached into his coat and pulled out a dream dictionary, its pages yellowed with age. [300]
The entries were written in paradoxical notes—*"Joy is the absence of sorrow, yet sorrow defines joy"*—each one a riddle that made his head ache. [327]
The advisor’s voice coiled around him: *"Read the one about the funhouse."* [340]

Elias flipped to the page. [345]
*"The funhouse is a lie,"* it read. *"Its mirrors show you what you fear, but its walls are made of what you’ve already survived."* [372]
A cold sweat prickled his neck. [380]
The mirrors ahead flickered, their surfaces rippling like water disturbed by a dropped stone. [399]

He stepped forward, and his reflection did not. [410]
It grinned—a slow, unnatural stretch of lips—and then lunged at him, hands pressing against the glass from the other side. [439]
Elias stumbled back, but the whispering advisor’s voice cut through the panic: *"It’s feeding on your fear. Starve it."* [464]

He forced himself to breathe, to study the reflection. [475]
It was him, but wrong—his eyes too wide, his smile too sharp, the opera cloak clasp glinting like a fang. [500]
The dream dictionary’s paradoxical notes echoed in his mind: *"The thing you fear is the thing that fears you."* [523]

Elias reached out and pressed his palm against the mirror. [535]
The reflection recoiled, its face twisting in something like terror. [546]
The glass between them warped, bending inward as if the reflection were being pulled into a void. [569]
A sound like shattering ice filled the air, and then—silence. [582]

The mirror was just a mirror again, its surface smooth and unbroken. [597]
Elias exhaled, his breath fogging the glass. [605]
The whispering advisor’s voice was a sigh: *"Fear’s weakness is that it believes its own lies."* [625]

He turned away from the mirrors, the lingering luminance in his vision fading like a dying ember. [645]
The funhouse was just a place now, its repulsive allure dulled by the truth. [660]
He unclasped the opera cloak and let it fall to the ground, the silver eye staring up at him like an accusation. [685]

Outside, the carnival was still abandoned, but the air smelled different—cleaner, lighter. [705]
Elias pulled the photographically cursed Polaroid from his pocket. [716]
This time, it showed only his face, clear and unmarred. [728]
He tore it in half and let the pieces flutter away. [740]

The whispering advisor was gone, but her words lingered: *"You tricked it, Elias. You made it see itself."* [762]
He smiled, the weight in his chest lighter than it had been in years. [779]
The funhouse’s laughter was just an echo now, and he was the one who had outlasted it. [799]
