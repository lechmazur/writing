The lighthouse beam cut through the fog like a blade, but Elias barely noticed. [12]
His fingers trembled over the half-finished portrait of the woman who had left him three weeks ago, her smile still trapped in charcoal strokes that refused to capture the way her eyes had dimmed before she walked out. [45]
The forgotten library inside the lighthouse was the only place that made sense anymore—its shelves sagging under the weight of books no one had touched in decades, their spines cracked like old bones. [82]
He had come here to escape, but the silence only amplified the questions he couldn’t answer: *Why did you stay so long? Why did you think this time would be different?* [118]

On the desk beside him, the broken tarot card box lay open, its contents spilled like a confession. [138]
Elias had found it buried under a stack of yellowed maps, the cards themselves warped by damp, their edges frayed as if chewed by time. [165]
He didn’t believe in fate, but the way the cards had scattered—*The Tower* face-up, *The Hanged Man* beneath it—felt like an accusation. [190]
*What if the answers aren’t out there?* he wondered, tracing the jagged tear in the box’s lid. *What if they’re buried in the cracks?* [216]

The walls of the library seemed to breathe, the shelves inching closer with every passing hour. [235]
Elias had read about lighthouses that swallowed themselves whole, their foundations rotting inward until the keepers vanished without a trace. [259]
He wasn’t afraid of disappearing—not yet—but the way the air thickened with each breath made him think of drowning in slow motion. [288]
*Is this what it feels like to unravel?* he asked the empty room, but the only reply was the groan of wood settling deeper into the earth. [318]

His motivation had always been simple: to descend into the necessary darkness, to face the things that scared him until they stopped mattering. [348]
But the darkness here wasn’t just absence—it was a living thing, a current pulling him under. [367]
He picked up the tarot cards, shuffling them despite their ruined state, and the act felt like trying to piece together a mirror after it had shattered. [397]
*How do you redesign a life when the blueprint is gone?* [412]

The answer came to him in fragments, the way light fractured through the lighthouse’s prism. [434]
He began by untangling threads—literally at first, pulling loose strands from the hem of his coat, then metaphorically, sorting through the memories he’d let tangle into knots. [465]
The portrait was the first thing he redesigned. [475]
He erased the woman’s face, then her hands, then the entire canvas, until all that remained was the suggestion of movement, a figure walking away into a storm. [508]
It wasn’t about her anymore. It was about the space she left behind. [526]

The library’s walls pressed closer, the shelves now so near he could touch them if he stretched. [547]
Elias didn’t fight it. [553]
He let the claustrophobia settle into his bones, let it sharpen into something like clarity. [573]
The broken tarot box was next. [582]
He glued the cards back together with strips of paper from an old ledger, their meanings rewritten in his own hand. *The Tower* became *The Rebuild*. *The Hanged Man* became *The Pause*. [616]
The act was absurd, but so was clinging to a reality that no longer fit. [636]

By the time he finished, the library had shrunk to the size of a coffin, the air thick with the scent of salt and old parchment. [665]
Elias didn’t resist when the walls finally closed in. [678]
He lay down on the floor, the redesigned cards fanned out around him like a second chance. [699]
*What if the only way out is through?* he thought, and then the darkness swallowed him whole. [723]

When he woke, the library was vast again, the shelves stretching into shadows that hadn’t been there before. [747]
The portrait leaned against the desk, its new version a swirl of grays and blacks, a storm with no center. [770]
Elias picked up his charcoal and began again. [778]
This time, he wasn’t drawing a person. [787]
He was drawing the shape of the ache. [796]
