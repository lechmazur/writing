The observatory’s dome yawned open like a forgotten mouth, its brass teeth catching the last embers of dusk. [16]
Captain Elias Veyra adjusted the drone’s goggles, his sharp eyes flicking between the flickering hologram and the real sky, where stars blinked awake one by one. [46]
He had been here before—too many times—but tonight was different. [58]
The pilgrim had arrived. [63]

She stood at the edge of the platform, her silhouette draped in a cloak woven from starlight itself, perpetually surprised by everything, as if the universe had just whispered a secret in her ear. [100]
Elias had seen her type before: seekers, wanderers, people who collected mysteries like coins. [117]
But this one carried something else—a small, rectangular chip, its surface etched with the ghostly imprint of a type foundry matrix, its purpose as obscure as the constellations above. [154]
She called it a "missing piece." [161]

"You’re telling me this thing can decode belonging?" Elias asked, his voice rough from disuse. [178]
The pilgrim smiled, her fingers tracing the chip’s edges. [187]
"Not decode," she corrected. "Reveal. Like following star trails home." [201]
Elias exhaled through his nose. [206]
He had spent years pulling fragments from the sky—data, debris, the occasional lost soul—but this? This was different. [233]
This was personal. [236]

The observatory’s ancient mechanisms groaned as he activated the drone, its hum filling the dim space. [256]
The pilgrim watched, her surprise never waning, as if every moment held a new wonder. [275]
Elias guided the drone toward the open dome, its camera feeding back grainy images of the sky. [293]
The chip in her hand pulsed faintly, as if responding to the drone’s frequency. [310]

"Belonging isn’t a place," she murmured. [317]
"It’s a frequency." [321]
Elias didn’t answer. [324]
He had spent his life chasing signals, but none had ever felt like this—like something was pulling him, not just the drone. [352]

The drone’s feed flickered, then stabilized on a cluster of stars Elias had never noticed before. [372]
They weren’t part of any known constellation, just a scattered handful, like breadcrumbs. [390]
The pilgrim’s breath hitched. [395]
"That’s it," she whispered. [400]
"The trail." [403]

Elias adjusted the drone’s trajectory, following the stars. [414]
The chip in the pilgrim’s hand grew warmer, its glow casting eerie shadows on the observatory’s walls. [436]
The air smelled of ozone and old parchment, the scent of forgotten knowledge. [451]
The pilgrim’s surprise deepened, her eyes wide as the drone’s feed revealed more—patterns, shapes, a language written in light. [481]

"You feel it too, don’t you?" she asked. [490]
Elias didn’t answer. [493]
He did. [495]
It was like a thread tugging at his chest, pulling him toward something he couldn’t name. [520]
The drone’s camera zoomed in on a single star, its light refracting into a spectrum of colors, each one humming at a different frequency. [550]

The pilgrim pressed the chip to the drone’s receiver. [561]
A sound filled the observatory—a low, resonant tone, like a choir of voices singing in unison. [585]
Elias’s hands shook. [590]
He had heard that sound before, in dreams, in the quiet moments between missions. [610]
It was the sound of belonging. [617]

The drone’s feed shifted again, revealing a structure in the void—a station, or perhaps a ship, its form half-hidden in the dark. [646]
The pilgrim laughed, her surprise giving way to something like recognition. [664]
"We’re not lost," she said. [670]
"We’re being called." [675]

Elias pulled the drone back, his mind racing. [685]
The chip, the stars, the frequency—it all made sense now. [698]
The missing pieces weren’t out there. [705]
They were in here, in the way the universe hummed when you finally listened. [723]

The pilgrim turned to him, her eyes bright with understanding. [735]
"You coming?" she asked. [739]
Elias hesitated, then nodded. [744]
The drone’s hum faded as he powered it down, the observatory’s dim light swallowing them whole. [764]
The stars would wait. [769]
But the call wouldn’t. [774]
[775]
