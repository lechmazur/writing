The last foghorn had gone silent three months ago, its deep groan swallowed by the city’s new quiet. [14]
Elias Voss, venerable oath scribe of the Celestial Archives, stood at the edge of the ancient orchard garden atop the Spire, his fingers brushing the gnarled bark of a pomegranate tree. [45]
The wax cylinder phonograph sat on a wrought-iron table beside him, its horn pointed toward the sky as if waiting for a voice from the clouds. [77]
He had come here not to record oaths, but to archive emotional patterns—something the Archives had never deemed necessary before the foghorn’s silence. [109]

Elias spoke dead languages fluently, though no one alive could verify his pronunciation. [127]
He murmured a line from the *Book of Unspoken Vows* in Old Sumerian, the words curling into the air like smoke. [147]
The phonograph’s needle trembled, then settled into the wax, capturing not just sound but the shape of his breath. [171]
It was an accidental prophecy, he realized—one he hadn’t meant to make. [184]

A memory surfaced, unbidden: a third-grade field trip to the docks, where he’d pressed his small hands against the foghorn’s vibrating metal. [210]
The children had laughed as the sound rattled their ribs, but Elias had felt something else—the way the noise had *immersed* them all, binding them in its resonance. [240]
Now, standing in the orchard, he wondered if the foghorn’s silence was a prophecy fulfilled, or one still unfolding. [263]

The garden was a relic, its trees older than the skyscraper that cradled it. [279]
Their roots twisted through steel beams, drinking from hidden aquifers. [290]
Elias had always found comfort in their permanence, but today, the orchard felt like a witness to something ending. [315]

He adjusted the phonograph’s horn, angling it toward the pomegranate tree. [330]
The wax cylinder spun, its surface glinting under the late afternoon sun. [347]
Elias recited another line, this time in Etruscan, a language meant for tombs and treaties. [367]
The words felt heavier here, as if the orchard itself was listening. [383]

A gust of wind rattled the branches, and a single pomegranate fell at his feet. [402]
He picked it up, the fruit’s weight surprising in his palm. [416]
Inside, the seeds were already splitting, their ruby juice staining his fingers. [432]
It was an omen, he thought—one that demanded interpretation. [445]

The Archives had sent him here to document the city’s grief, but Elias suspected they wanted more. [464]
They wanted to know if the silence was a void or a vessel. [479]
He pressed the pomegranate to the phonograph’s horn, letting its juice drip onto the wax. [498]
The needle hissed, then caught, recording the sound of the fruit’s surrender. [517]

The orchard darkened as the sun dipped below the horizon. [531]
Elias spoke again, this time in a language so old it had no name. [550]
The phonograph whirred, its mechanism straining against the weight of the words. [568]
When he played it back, the sound was not his voice but something deeper—a chorus of whispers, as if the dead had borrowed his tongue. [598]

He understood then: the foghorn’s silence wasn’t an absence but an invitation. [617]
The city had been speaking all along, and he had finally learned to listen. [635]
The wax cylinder would hold not just his voice, but the orchard’s breath, the pomegranate’s pulse, the ghost of the foghorn’s last note. [666]

Elias packed the phonograph carefully, the wax cylinder now warm in his hands. [683]
The Archives would call this an accident, but he knew better. [698]
Some prophecies were never meant to be spoken—they were meant to be *lived*. [717]

The orchard rustled behind him, its leaves whispering in a language only the wind understood. [737]
Elias smiled, his fingers stained red with pomegranate juice. [750]
The foghorn’s silence had been a beginning, not an end. [763]
And he was just getting started. [770]
