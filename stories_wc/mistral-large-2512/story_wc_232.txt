The bell above the door of Elias Voss’s shop chimed, but no one entered. [12]
He sighed, running a finger along the edge of a 17th-century portolan chart, its ink faded to the color of old tea. [33]
The maps had been his only companions for years, their silent stories more reliable than the people who occasionally wandered in, then out again. [63]
Elias had inherited the shop from his father, who had inherited it from his, and somewhere along the way, the promise to keep the place alive had become a weight rather than a purpose. [101]
He traced the coastline of a landmass that no longer existed, wondering if the cartographer had known even then that it was doomed. [131]

The type foundry matrix chip sat in a velvet-lined drawer, its brass surface etched with tiny, precise grooves. [154]
Elias had found it years ago in a lot of miscellaneous printing ephemera, its purpose obscure but its craftsmanship undeniable. [179]
He’d kept it, though he couldn’t say why—perhaps because it was the last thing his father had handled before the stroke took him. [208]
The chip was empirically intuitive, its design so elegant that even without understanding its function, Elias could feel its rightness, like a key waiting for a lock. [242]

Outside, the creek behind the shop had begun to rise, its usual murmur swelling into a steady rush. [264]
Elias pressed his palm against the window, watching the water creep closer to the back door. [285]
It was midsummer, and the blooming cavern beneath the town was said to exhale with the season, filling the underground rivers until they spilled over. [315]
No one had ever seen the cavern, but the elders spoke of it in hushed tones, as if fearing it might hear. [340]

That night, as Elias locked up, he noticed a trail of ants marching across the floorboards, their tiny bodies glinting in the dim light. [369]
He knelt, watching as they disappeared into a crack near the baseboard. [386]
Following ants home was something he’d done as a child, back when the world had seemed full of hidden paths. [415]
Without thinking, he grabbed a flashlight and a screwdriver, prying up the loose board. [435]
The ants led him through a narrow passage, their procession unbroken even as the air grew damp and cool. [461]

The tunnel opened into a vast cavern, its walls alive with bioluminescent blossoms that pulsed like slow heartbeats. [490]
The creek roared nearby, its waters higher than he’d ever seen, lapping at the edges of a stone platform. [517]
Elias’s breath caught. [522]
At the center of the platform stood a door, its surface carved with intricate patterns that seemed to shift when he blinked. [551]
The doorway of decisions, he realized with a jolt. [564]
The elders had spoken of it too—the place where choices became tangible, where paths diverged not in theory, but in stone and wood. [597]

The type foundry matrix chip in his pocket grew warm. [610]
He pulled it out, holding it up to the light. [622]
The grooves matched the patterns on the door, as if it were meant to fit into some hidden mechanism. [648]
Elias hesitated. [652]
The promise he’d carried for so long—to keep the shop, to honor his father—suddenly felt hollow. [680]
What if the real promise had been to find this place, to step through and see what lay beyond? [708]

The creek rose higher, the water swirling around his ankles. [725]
The door glimmered, its surface rippling like water, and for the first time in years, Elias felt something akin to hope. [755]
He pressed the chip into the door’s center. [768]
It clicked into place, and the patterns flared to life, illuminating a path he hadn’t seen before. [794]
The ants, still marching, led the way. [802]
