The hanging orchard clung to the ravine’s walls like a desperate thought, its gnarled roots exposed by centuries of storms. [18]
Mira knelt in the damp loam, her fingers brushing the soil where truffles hid—rational, predictable, unlike the chaos of the world above. [44]
She had come here after the empathy virus, when touch became a minefield and silence the only safe language. [68]
The orchard’s isolation was its gift; no one dared descend the slick paths, not even the desperate. [89]

Her lantern flickered, casting long shadows over the antique glass eye she’d found half-buried near the ravine’s edge. [114]
It was too perfect, too *old*, its iris a swirl of amber and gold, as if it had witnessed something unspeakable. [137]
Mira turned it in her palm, her stomach tightening. [146]
She knew relics when she saw them—smuggled, cursed, or worse—and this one reeked of both. [163]

A gust howled through the ravine, and the orchard’s branches groaned like a living thing. [180]
Mira tucked the eye into her satchel, her pulse quickening. [190]
She had spent years cultivating psychological safety, building walls between herself and the world’s cruelty. [211]
But the eye *demanded* attention, its weight a silent accusation. [226]

That night, back in her hut, she cracked open a discredited textbook she’d salvaged from a ruined library. [244]
The pages smelled of mildew and old secrets, its margins scribbled with frantic notes about rumored cures for things no one named. [269]
One passage caught her eye: *"The Hollow Eye of Veyth occludes truth, not light."* [284]
Mira’s breath hitched. [290]
She had always been involuntarily truthful—words spilled from her before she could stop them, a curse in a world that punished honesty. [318]

The next morning, she returned to the orchard, the glass eye burning a hole in her pocket. [340]
If the texts were right, this relic could *hide* her truths, not just reveal them. [358]
She pressed it to her left socket, wincing as the cold glass settled against her skin. [376]
The world blurred, then sharpened—colors too vivid, sounds too crisp. [390]
And then, the voices. [394]

*"You’re afraid,"* whispered the wind, though no one was there. [407]
Mira recoiled, but the eye held fast. [415]
*"You think safety is silence, but silence is just another kind of storm."* [433]
She tore the eye free, her hands shaking. [443]
It wasn’t occluding truth—it was *amplifying* it, forcing her to hear the ravine’s secrets, the orchard’s grief, her own fears. [470]

A branch snapped behind her. [475]
Mira spun, her heart hammering, but it was only a fox, its fur matted with rain. [494]
It watched her, unblinking, before vanishing into the undergrowth. [508]
She exhaled, her breath fogging in the cold air. [518]
The eye was a liar. [523]
It didn’t protect—it *exposed*, turning her carefully constructed safety into a joke. [546]

That night, she dreamed of the ravine swallowing her whole, the orchard’s roots wrapping around her ankles like chains. [573]
She woke gasping, the glass eye glowing faintly on her nightstand. [589]
She couldn’t destroy it—it was too old, too *alive*—but she could bury it where it belonged. [612]

At dawn, she returned to the spot where she’d found it, the storm-worn earth still damp from last night’s rain. [637]
She dug with her hands, the soil clinging to her nails. [650]
When the hole was deep enough, she placed the eye inside, whispering, *"Take your truths back."* [674]
The moment it touched the earth, the wind stilled. [687]
The orchard sighed. [692]

Mira filled the hole, her fingers trembling. [701]
She had spent years running from honesty, but the eye had taught her something worse: safety wasn’t in silence. [725]
It was in the storm. [730]
In the roots that held you, even when they hurt. [741]
In the truth, no matter how ugly. [749]

She stood, brushing the dirt from her knees. [758]
The ravine was still there, the orchard still swaying, the world still broken. [774]
But for the first time since the empathy virus, she didn’t feel alone in it. [792]
The eye was gone. [796]
Her fear remained. [800]
And that, she realized, was the point. [808]
