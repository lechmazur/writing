The locksmith, Elias Veyne, had always been peripherally focused—his gaze lingering on the edges of things, the way light fractured through a prism or how a key’s teeth caught the lamplight just so. [24]
Tonight, in the marble cavern beneath his shop, he traced the grooves of a broken timer mechanism with calloused fingers, its brass gears frozen mid-tick. [52]
The cavern was vast, its walls veined with quartz that hummed when the wind slipped through the fissures above, a sound like distant chimes. [81]
Elias had found the timer years ago in the wreckage of an old clocktower, its purpose unclear but its craftsmanship undeniable. [108]
He had carried it down here, to this place where time felt suspended, where the air smelled of damp stone and old secrets. [134]

The harvest of echoes was what he called the quiet moments when the world seemed to hold its breath—the pause between a sigh and the exhale, the second before a door latched shut. [168]
Elias believed these echoes could be captured, stored like preserves in a cellar, to be savored when the world grew too loud. [192]
The timer was his first attempt to reverse-engineer the process, to build a vessel for wonder. [211]
But the mechanism was broken, its gears misaligned, its purpose lost to time. [229]

He had spent months studying reflection angles at different times of day, watching how sunlight bled through the cavern’s skylight, how it painted the walls in shifting hues. [260]
The angles changed with the season, and this was the lull of a wounded one—the last gasp of autumn before winter’s teeth sank in. [287]
Elias had marked the walls with chalk, noting the way light bent at dawn versus dusk, how it pooled in the crevices like liquid gold. [318]
He believed the echoes were strongest when the light was weakest, when the world teetered on the edge of darkness. [345]

Tonight, he knelt by the timer, its brass casing cold against his palm. [361]
He had dismantled it a dozen times, but tonight he would try something new. [379]
Using a sliver of quartz from the cavern wall, he pried at the gears, coaxing them into motion. [401]
The mechanism groaned, then stuttered, its hands jerking forward before stopping short. [422]
Elias exhaled, his breath fogging in the chill air. [435]

A sound echoed through the cavern—a whisper, or perhaps the wind. [450]
He turned, but there was nothing, only the marble and the quartz and the faintest hum of the timer’s broken heart. [475]
Then he saw it: a reflection in the quartz, not of himself, but of something else. [496]
A figure stood in the shadows, its edges blurred, its form shifting like smoke. [517]
Elias’s pulse quickened. [524]

He had read about such things—echoes given form, memories made flesh. [543]
The harvest was not just a metaphor. [552]
The timer had been trying to tell him that all along. [564]
He adjusted the quartz, tilting it until the reflection sharpened. [579]
The figure stepped forward, and Elias recognized it: a younger version of himself, from the day he had first discovered the cavern. [610]

The boy smiled, then reached out, his fingers brushing the timer’s casing. [631]
The gears whirred to life, smooth and steady, the hands spinning backward. [650]
Elias watched, transfixed, as the cavern filled with light—not from the skylight, but from the echoes themselves, swirling like fireflies. [682]
The boy faded, but the timer kept ticking, its rhythm syncing with Elias’s heartbeat. [706]

He understood then. [711]
The harvest was not about storing wonder for later. [722]
It was about letting it go, about trusting the echoes to return when they were needed most. [745]
The timer was not broken—it had been waiting. [757]
Elias closed his eyes and listened to the sound of time rewinding, of echoes finding their way home. [783]
The lull of the wounded season stretched around him, endless and kind. [799]
