The ambered observatory deck hummed with the low thrum of distant stars, their light trapped in the glass like insects in honey. [18]
Elias stood at the edge, his fingers tracing the collection of foreign coins in his pocket, each one a relic from a civilization that had long since collapsed into cosmic dust. [53]
He had cast lots that morning, scattering the polished stones across the deck’s warped floorboards, and the pattern they formed had been unmistakable—though not in the way he’d hoped. [91]
The prophecy wasn’t wrong, he realized; it was backwards. [102]
It had always been backwards. [106]

The universe had contracted once already, folding in on itself like a dying breath, and now it pulsed in reverse, expanding not toward heat death but toward something else—something no one had dared name. [148]
Elias’s purpose had been clear before the collapse: to align his wavelength with the rhythm of creation, to become a conduit for the song of the cosmos. [177]
But the song had changed. [182]
Now, it crackled with static bursts, fragments of meaning lost in the noise, and his enthusiasm—once a roaring fire—had settled into something quieter, steadier, like the embers of a dying star. [223]

He pulled the coins from his pocket and let them spill onto the deck. [237]
They clattered, each one a different weight, a different metal, a different history. [252]
One bore the face of a king who had ruled a planet that no longer existed; another was stamped with a constellation that had since unraveled. [281]
Elias had spent years distilling their stories, extracting the essence of what they had once meant. [303]
But meaning was slippery now. [307]

The static bursts in the observatory’s speakers grew louder, a chorus of half-formed voices. [325]
Elias closed his eyes and listened. [330]
He had spent a lifetime trying to understand them, to parse the language of the universe as it stuttered and repeated, but the more he learned, the less he knew. [366]
The prophecy had promised clarity, but clarity was a lie. [379]
The universe was not a puzzle to be solved; it was a conversation to be endured. [397]

His fingers hovered over the coins. [404]
If the prophecy was backwards, then so was his approach. [416]
Instead of seeking to align with purpose, he needed to let purpose align with him. [433]
The coins were not answers—they were questions, each one a whisper from a past that refused to stay buried. [458]
He picked up the one with the king’s face and turned it over in his palm. [474]
The metal was cold, but it warmed under his touch, as if remembering. [489]

Outside, the stars flickered, their light bending in ways that defied physics. [507]
Elias exhaled, his breath fogging the glass. [516]
Stellar doubt gnawed at him, not the paralyzing kind, but the sort that sharpened his focus, that made him lean into the uncertainty. [546]
He had spent too long chasing certainties in a universe that had none. [563]
The static bursts crescendoed, and for the first time, he didn’t flinch. [580]

He placed the coin back on the deck and picked up another, this one etched with the unraveled constellation. [604]
If the universe was contracting again, if it was rewriting itself, then perhaps the past was not a fixed point but a fluid thing, something that could be reshaped. [643]
Elias smiled, quietly enthusiastic. [650]
The prophecy hadn’t been a roadmap—it had been a mirror. [664]
And in its reflection, he saw not the end of all things, but the beginning of something new. [689]

The static bursts resolved into a single, clear note. [701]
Elias closed his fist around the coins. [709]
He didn’t know what came next, but for the first time in years, he was ready to listen. [732]
The universe had spoken. [737]
Now, it was his turn. [742]
