The scavenger crouched on the rusted platform, her breath fogging the thin air of the kinetic lagoon above the clouds. [16]
Below her, the carousel’s broken horses spun no more—just swayed in the wind, their painted eyes staring into nothing. [37]
She had come here after the carousel halted, drawn by whispers of a place where time unraveled like frayed thread. [62]
Her pockets bulged with trinkets: a chipped music box, a child’s mitten, a disposable camera wheel she’d found wedged between the slats of a bench. [88]
The wheel was still warm, as if someone had just used it, though the last photo taken had faded decades ago. [111]

She didn’t know why she kept it. [117]
Regret clung to her like the damp mist rising from the lagoon, a weight she couldn’t shake. [137]
She had been resolute once, certain her path would lead somewhere grand. [152]
Now, her ambitions eroded like the edges of the wheel’s plastic teeth, worn smooth by time and neglect. [175]

A voice drifted up from the lagoon’s surface, a fragment of a story not her own. [192]
*"I should’ve told her I loved her before the bridge collapsed,"* it sighed, dissolving into the wind. [214]
The scavenger tilted her head, listening. [220]
This was how she lived now—by collecting fragments of overheard stories, stitching them into something like meaning. [243]

The lagoon itself was a puzzle of shifting currents, its waters thick with reflections that didn’t match the sky. [264]
She had seen a man step into it once, only to emerge years younger, his face unlined, his memories gone. [287]
He had wept when he realized he no longer recognized his own hands. [303]
She wondered if that was what she was doing here: negotiating with her own ghost, the version of herself who still believed in destinations. [336]

The camera wheel clicked in her palm, though no film remained. [349]
She pressed it to her ear, half-expecting to hear the laughter of the person who’d last used it. [368]
Instead, there was only static, a sound like time slipping through fingers. [382]

She stood, her boots creaking on the platform. [390]
The lagoon stretched before her, a mirror that refused to hold a single truth. [409]
Somewhere in its depths, her ghost waited—patient, disappointed, familiar. [426]
She had come to bargain, but the terms were unclear. [439]
Did she want forgiveness? Absolution? Or just the right to stop pretending she wasn’t lost? [465]

A shadow moved beneath the water. [472]
Not a fish, not a reflection—something with edges too sharp to be natural. [492]
Her breath hitched. [495]
The scavenger had spent years avoiding her own gaze in still surfaces, but here, in this fractured stillness, she had no choice. [526]

She knelt, dipping her fingers into the lagoon. [536]
The water was neither warm nor cold, just *there*, like the moment between heartbeats. [556]
The shadow solidified, rising to meet her—a figure with her face, but softer, younger, untouched by erosion. [584]
*"You took too long,"* her ghost said, voice like wind through broken glass. [601]

The scavenger swallowed. [604]
She had rehearsed this conversation a thousand times, but now the words tangled in her throat. [628]
*"I thought I had time,"* she admitted. [637]
The ghost smiled, sad and knowing. [644]
*"Time doesn’t care what you think,"* it replied. [654]

The disposable camera wheel rolled from her fingers, sinking into the lagoon without a splash. [674]
The scavenger watched it disappear, a tiny relic of a life she could no longer claim. [698]
Her ghost reached out, not to touch her, but to trace the air between them, as if measuring the distance. [727]
*"What now?"* the scavenger asked. [734]

The ghost’s form rippled, dissolving into the mist. [744]
*"Now,"* it said, *"you listen."* [751]
The scavenger turned, and for the first time in years, she heard the world without flinching. [771]
The lagoon hummed with stories—some hers, some borrowed, all unfinished. [789]
She exhaled, long and slow, and let the wind carry the weight away. [807]
