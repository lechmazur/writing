The cabin creaked under the weight of too many winters, its logs groaning like an old man remembering wars he never fought. [19]
Elias Veyne, lucid dream chronicler, sat at the scarred pine table, his fingers tracing the edges of a birch bark scroll unrolled before him. [45]
The ink had bled in places, the words swimming as if the past itself resisted being pinned down. [70]
He had found it yesterday, tucked beneath a loose floorboard in the ranger cabin’s loft, its edges brittle with age but its message still sharp: *"You will stand where the dead rest and wish you could soar."* [111]
Elias had read it a dozen times, each pass deepening the hollow in his chest. [129]
The handwriting was unmistakably his own. [137]

He had seen his own grave three days prior. [146]
Not in a dream—though he’d had those, vivid and cruel—but in the flesh, the headstone half-buried in the mountain’s shadow, the date chiseled into granite a decade before his birth. [187]
The ranger who’d shown him, a grizzled man named Harkin, had laughed when Elias stumbled back, his boot heel catching on a root. [217]
*"Chronologically confused, eh?"* Harkin had said, spitting into the dirt. *"Happens to the best of us up here."* [240]
Elias hadn’t corrected him. [244]

The birch bark scroll was proof, though. [252]
Proof that he wasn’t just losing time—he was *competing* with it. [267]
Somewhere in the past, another version of himself had stood in this very cabin, had written these words, had known what was coming. [293]
And now, here Elias was, getting jealous of past selves, resenting the man he’d been for having answers he couldn’t remember. [321]
The jealousy was a living thing, coiling in his gut. [331]
That earlier Elias had *soared*—hadn’t he?—had seen the shape of things before they unraveled. [351]
While this Elias was left sifting through fragments, trying to distill chaos into narrative before the mountain swallowed him whole. [380]

Feral nostalgia gnawed at him, a hunger that wasn’t for the past but for the *clarity* of it. [401]
The dreams had always been lucid, but lately, they’d turned vicious, showing him glimpses of lives he might’ve lived if time had bent differently. [434]
In one, he’d been a cartographer, his maps sold in cities he’d never visit. [450]
In another, he’d died young, his grave marked with a name that wasn’t his. [468]
Each dream left him waking with a scream caught in his throat, the taste of iron and pine on his tongue. [494]

The cabin’s walls were lined with other scrolls, their contents a patchwork of half-remembered truths. [516]
Some were his; others bore handwriting he didn’t recognize, though his fingers itched to claim them. [538]
He’d spent years collecting them, driven by the same compulsion that made men carve their names into trees: *I was here. I mattered.* [569]
But the mountain didn’t care. [575]
It had seen a thousand Elias Veynes come and go, each one convinced he was the first. [598]

That night, the wind howled through the eaves like a thing alive. [613]
Elias lit a fire, the birch bark scroll clutched in his hand. [628]
He could burn it. [632]
Let the past stay buried. [640]
But the words had already taken root in his mind, their edges sharp as the mountain’s teeth. [662]
*"You will stand where the dead rest and wish you could soar."* [680]
He wondered if the man who’d written it had felt the same jealousy, the same feral ache for a life that slipped through his fingers like mist. [714]

Outside, something moved in the dark. [723]
Not an animal—too deliberate, too *aware*. [733]
Elias held his breath. [738]
The door rattled, not with the wind, but with the weight of a body pressing against it. [761]
His past self, come to claim what he’d left behind? [776]
Or his future, come to drag him into the earth? [791]

The latch clicked. [795]
The door swung open. [800]
