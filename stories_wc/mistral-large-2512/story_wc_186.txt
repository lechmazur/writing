The glass humming pavilion stood at the edge of the salt flats, its walls singing with every gust of wind that scraped across the cracked panes. [19]
Elias had been its custodian for twelve years, ever since the last beacon-tower fell silent, its light swallowed by the dust of a dead civilization. [46]
He kept the pavilion’s lanterns lit not for warmth—there was none to give—but to remind the stars they were still being watched. [78]
That was the job of a beacon-tower custodian, after all: to be the last pair of eyes in a world that had forgotten how to look up. [112]

The broken crystal prism lay on the warped wooden table, its shards catching the dim light like frozen tears. [136]
Elias had found it three days prior, half-buried in the alkali crust, its edges still sharp enough to draw blood if he wasn’t careful. [167]
He didn’t know what it had been—a lens, a relic, a tool for splitting light into something holy—but he knew what it was now: a shard of hush. [199]
The way it stilled the wind when he held it, the way it made his thoughts go quiet, as if the world had taken a breath and forgotten to exhale. [235]

Retrocognitively blessed, his grandmother had called it when he was a boy, pressing her thumb to the center of his forehead. [259]
"You see what was, not what is," she’d said, and he’d believed her, because sometimes he woke from dreams with the taste of old rain on his tongue and the weight of cities that no longer stood. [299]
Now, those visions came unbidden, fragments of a time when the pavilion had been whole, when the beacon-towers had blazed like fallen stars, when the air had hummed with voices instead of silence. [346]

Elias wanted to rekindle something. [352]
Not the towers—they were gone, their bones picked clean by time—but the idea of them, the promise that someone, somewhere, had once believed in light enough to build toward the sky. [399]
He had spent years tracking star paths, charting the slow drift of constellations that no longer matched the maps in his grandfather’s books. [436]
The stars were still there, but they had moved, as if the world had tilted and they’d slid to new places in the dark. [466]
If he could follow their old routes, he thought, maybe he could find the moment the world had broken—and stitch it back together. [499]

His motivation was simple: to prove that coincidences have meaning. [514]
The prism in the salt. The hum of the pavilion. The way the last beacon-tower had fallen the night his grandmother died. [542]
If those weren’t signs, then what was the point of anything? [557]

That evening, he climbed to the pavilion’s highest platform, the broken prism tucked into his coat. [581]
The wind was sharp, carrying the scent of rust and distant storms. [597]
He held the shard to the sky, turning it until the light fractured into a dozen tiny suns. [625]
For a moment, the pavilion’s song changed, deepened, as if it remembered a melody it had forgotten. [654]

Then he saw it: a flicker on the horizon, a pulse of gold where there should have been only dark. [682]
His breath caught. [685]
The last beacon-tower wasn’t dead. [694]
It was waiting. [697]

Elias laughed, a sound like dry leaves skittering across stone. [716]
The stars had led him here. The prism had shown him the way. [734]
And if that wasn’t meaning, then he didn’t know what was. [750]

He climbed down, his boots crunching on broken glass, and began to walk. [767]
The pavilion hummed behind him, its song softer now, as if it knew he wouldn’t be back. [795]
Somewhere ahead, the beacon waited. [805]
And Elias would rekindle it, one shard of hush at a time. [823]
