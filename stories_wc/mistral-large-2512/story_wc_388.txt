The wasteland orchard stretched before Elias Vey, its gnarled trees heavy with fruit that glowed faintly under the sickly moonlight. [18]
Radioactive dust swirled in the air, but the branches bent without breaking, defiant against the poisoned earth. [36]
Elias adjusted his respirator, the filters long past their prime, and stepped between the rows, his boots sinking into the spongy soil. [62]
He wasn’t here for the fruit—no one ate from these trees, not even the desperate. [80]
He was here for the truth, buried beneath layers of comfortable lies. [94]

A conspiracy debunker by trade, Elias had spent years dismantling myths that kept people docile. [113]
This time, the myth was a diamond—flawed, rumored to be cursed, and supposedly hidden in the orchard’s heart. [133]
The last owner had vanished after the liquidation, when the government seized his land and erased his name from the records. [156]
Elias had only fragments to work with: shredded letters, a single photograph, and his own sharply observant instincts. [177]

He crouched beside a hollow tree, its bark blackened by radiation but its roots still pulsing with life. [199]
Inside, a nest of torn paper lay scattered like confetti. [211]
Elias exhaled, his breath fogging the inside of his mask, and began to intuit the patterns. [230]
The letters had been shredded deliberately, but the tears were too precise—someone had wanted them reassembled. [251]

Hours passed as he pieced together the fragments, his fingers numb from the cold. [269]
The first letter spoke of a "stillpoint," a place where time bent, where the orchard’s secrets were kept. [291]
The second mentioned the diamond, not as a jewel, but as a key. [306]
The third—a warning. *"They will come for it. Burn this."* [322]

Elias’s pulse quickened. [327]
The liquidation hadn’t been about land; it had been about silencing the truth. [346]
The diamond wasn’t cursed—it was a tool, one that could expose the stillpoint’s location. [367]
And the orchard? It thrived because it wasn’t just an orchard. [384]

He stood abruptly, the letters clutched in his gloved hand. [397]
A sound cut through the wind—a boot crunching on dead leaves. [413]
Elias turned, his body tensing, but it was too late. [427]
A figure emerged from the dust, their silhouette familiar. [442]
"Didn’t think you’d piece it together so fast," the stranger said, their voice muffled by a gas mask. [464]

Elias didn’t recognize them, but he recognized the insignia on their sleeve: the same one from the shredded letters. [488]
"They sent you to finish the job," Elias said, his voice steady despite the adrenaline. [509]
The stranger tilted their head. "No. I came to see if you’d *understand*." [527]

Elias’s mind raced. [532]
The stillpoint wasn’t a myth—it was a place where the orchard’s radiation didn’t reach, where the trees grew untainted. [560]
The diamond was the key to unlocking it, to proving the government had lied about the wasteland’s toxicity. [587]
And the liquidation? A cover-up. [595]

"You’re not here to stop me," Elias realized. [606]
The stranger removed their mask, revealing a face lined with exhaustion. [623]
"I’m here to help you find it," they said. [634]
"Before they do." [639]

Elias nodded, the letters burning in his grip. [650]
The truth was closer than he’d thought, buried beneath the lies like the orchard’s roots beneath the dust. [676]
And he would excavate it, no matter the cost. [691]

The stranger led him deeper into the orchard, where the trees grew denser, their leaves shimmering with an eerie light. [720]
At the center, a clearing opened—a perfect circle of untouched earth. [740]
The stillpoint. [743]

Elias knelt, pressing his palm to the soil. [754]
It was warm, alive. [760]
The stranger placed the flawed diamond into his hand. [774]
"It’s not cursed," they whispered. "It’s a lens." [786]

Elias held it up, and the world shifted. [798]
Through the diamond’s imperfections, he saw the truth: the orchard wasn’t just surviving—it was *healing*. [824]
And the government had tried to bury that knowledge forever. [837]
