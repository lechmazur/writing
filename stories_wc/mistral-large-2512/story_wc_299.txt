The quarry office trailer smelled of diesel and old coffee. [8]
Jake Mercer leaned back in his creaking chair, fingers tracing the frayed edge of a speaker grille cloth scrap he’d found tucked in his jacket pocket that morning. [34]
It was the last remnant of his old life—the one where he’d been somebody, even if just the guy who made sure the amps didn’t blow before the encore. [69]

Outside, the wind howled through the echo valley, carrying the ghost of applause that had once filled stadiums. [93]
Now, it just carried dust. [96]

He’d failed publicly, spectacularly, the night the tour bus skidded into a ditch outside Albuquerque. [119]
Not his fault—the driver had been high—but the headlines didn’t care. [134]
"Mercer’s Misfire: Roadie’s Error Costs Band Millions." [145]
The truth was messier: Jake had begged the sound engineer to check the cables, but no one listened. [166]
The feedback shriek had been the last thing he heard before the world went sideways. [183]

Now, he appraised antiques for a living, or at least pretended to. [197]
The quarry owner, a grizzled man named Roy, had hired him to catalog the junk in the trailer after Jake drunkenly boasted he could spot a fake Rolex at twenty paces. [231]
Roy didn’t care about watches; he just wanted someone to sort through decades of abandoned tools, rusted machinery, and the occasional Civil War-era pickaxe. [265]

Jake held the speaker grille cloth up to the light. [277]
The fabric was still vibrant, a deep indigo with a faint silver thread weave—custom, probably worth something to a collector. [298]
He could sell it, maybe, or frame it as a reminder. [310]
Instead, he folded it carefully and slipped it back into his pocket. [324]

Purpose wasn’t something you found; it was something you wrest from the jaws of failure. [344]
That’s what his therapist had said, anyway, in the three sessions Jake had attended before deciding facts were better insulation than feelings. [370]
Facts didn’t betray you. [375]
Facts were the difference between a 1923 Gibson L-1 and a 1930s knockoff. [392]
Facts were the reason he knew the pickaxe in the corner was authentic—its weight, its balance, the way the handle had been worn smooth by generations of hands. [430]

Roy lumbered in, his boots leaving muddy prints on the linoleum. [447]
"Find anything good?" he grunted. [453]

Jake tapped the pickaxe. [457]
"Eighteen-fifties, maybe earlier. [464]
Probably used in this quarry when it was still operational. [478]
Worth a few grand to the right buyer." [489]

Roy nodded, unimpressed. [494]
"Kid used to work here swore it was haunted. [507]
Said he heard singing down in the pit at night." [523]

Jake’s fingers twitched toward his pocket. [532]
"Echoes," he said. [535]
"Sound carries weird in valleys like this." [548]

But he knew better. [553]
He’d spent years chasing sound, shaping it, making it *mean* something. [571]
Now, he was just another ghost in the mix. [581]

That night, he drove to the edge of the quarry, where the pit yawned like an open wound. [602]
The wind was louder here, a low moan that could’ve been the earth itself mourning. [623]
Jake pulled out the speaker grille cloth and let it flutter in the breeze. [641]
For a second, he swore he heard music—a distant, distorted riff, the kind that used to make his pulse race. [671]

He laughed, sharp and bitter. [678]
Of course it was just the wind. [686]

But then he heard it again, clearer this time. [698]
Not the wind. [702]
A voice. [705]

"Jake?" [708]

He turned. [710]
Standing at the edge of the pit was a woman in a faded denim jacket, her hair whipping around her face. [736]
She looked familiar, but he couldn’t place her—not until she smiled. [755]

"Lena," he breathed. [759]
The band’s backup singer, the one who’d quit after the Albuquerque crash. [778]

"You still carrying that thing around?" she asked, nodding at the grille cloth. [797]

Jake’s throat tightened. [802]
"Sometimes," he said. [806]
"Helps me remember." [812]

Lena stepped closer, her boots crunching on gravel. [825]
"Remember what?" [828]

He hesitated, then pulled the cloth from his pocket and held it out. [845]
"That there was a time I knew what I was doing." [860]

She took it, her fingers brushing his. [868]
"Or maybe," she said, "you’re just confidently uncertain." [881]

The wind howled between them, and for the first time in years, Jake didn’t feel like he was listening to an echo. [912]
He was listening to the future. [920]
