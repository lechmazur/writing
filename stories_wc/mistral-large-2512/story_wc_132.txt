The first drops of the storm season had just begun to patter against the mossy trellis when Mara stepped outside her nursery, her boots sinking slightly into the damp earth. [23]
She had spent the last three years cultivating rare specimens, but none had ever behaved like the linden sapling trembling in its pot near the greenhouse. [53]
Its leaves, usually broad and heart-shaped, had curled inward overnight, their edges darkening as if singed by an unseen flame. [81]
Mara crouched beside it, her fingers brushing the soil, which was cooler than it should have been this time of year. [107]
She had chosen this life—tending plants, studying their quiet revolutions—not because she craved stillness, but because she understood transformation better than most. [141]

The sapling’s distress wasn’t the only oddity. [148]
Earlier that morning, she had found a single linden leaf pressed into the spine of her ledger, though no tree stood within a mile of the nursery. [178]
It was too perfect, too deliberate, like a message left by someone who knew she’d notice. [198]
Mara had tucked it into her pocket, where it now rested against her thigh, its veins pulsing faintly beneath her touch—though that, she told herself, was just the rain. [237]

She had come to the trellis to escape the suffocating humidity of the greenhouse, but also to think. [257]
The storm season was always like this: a time of upheaval, when the sky’s moods dictated the rhythm of growth. [283]
Plants stretched toward the lightning’s glow or recoiled from the wind’s bite, and Mara had made it her life’s work to document these responses. [314]
But the linden sapling was different. [321]
It wasn’t reacting to the weather—it was *changing*, its bark splitting in places to reveal something smooth and iridescent beneath. [352]

Mara exhaled, her breath fogging in the damp air. [362]
She had seen this before, in the old texts her grandmother had left her, the ones that spoke of plants that weren’t plants at all. [387]
The words had always felt like folklore, but now, watching the sapling’s leaves darken further, she wondered if she’d been wrong to dismiss them. [421]
The transformation was reluctant, almost pained, as if the tree were fighting its own nature. [444]

She reached out, hesitating before touching the sapling’s trunk. [458]
The moment her fingers made contact, the bark softened, yielding like warm wax. [476]
A sound escaped her—half gasp, half laugh—as the sapling’s branches began to twist, not toward the sky, but toward *her*. [505]
It was circuitously sincere, this metamorphosis: not a sudden bloom or a violent unraveling, but a slow, deliberate reshaping, as if the tree were trying to tell her something without words. [548]

Mara’s pulse quickened. [553]
She had spent years trying to control the growth of her plants, pruning them into submission, but this—this was something else entirely. [582]
The sapling didn’t need her guidance. [590]
It needed her to *let go*. [596]

She closed her eyes and exhaled, releasing the tension in her shoulders. [612]
The storm rumbled overhead, and for the first time, she didn’t flinch. [628]
When she opened her eyes, the sapling’s branches had stilled, its leaves now shimmering with a faint, silver sheen. [657]
The linden leaf in her pocket grew warm, and she pulled it out, watching as its edges curled inward, mirroring the sapling’s transformation. [691]

Mara understood then. [696]
The leaf wasn’t a message—it was an invitation. [708]
The sapling wasn’t a plant, not really. [717]
It was something older, something that had been waiting for her to stop trying to *reconstruct* the world in her image. [748]
To study plant behaviors was one thing, but to witness a metamorphosis like this—one that demanded surrender—was another. [779]

She knelt in the mud, her hands cupped around the sapling’s base. [794]
The rain fell harder, but she didn’t move. [802]
The storm season had only just begun, and she had a feeling this was only the first of many transformations to come. [831]
