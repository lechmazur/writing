The city of forgotten fountains had once been alive with the sound of rushing water, but now its stone basins stood dry, their mouths agape like silent witnesses to a crime no one remembered. [25]
Elara crouched beside the oldest fountain, her fingers tracing the cracks in its weathered lip, where moss had long since surrendered to dust. [49]
She was a luminous skeptic—her mind sharp as shattered glass, her heart a flickering lantern in the dark. [69]
She didn’t believe in ghosts, but she believed in the weight of absence, in the way the air hummed when something had been taken. [95]

The stained glass box sat in her lap, its panes fractured into jagged constellations of blue and gold. [115]
It had been left on her doorstep at dawn, wrapped in oilcloth and tied with twine that smelled of rain and old paper. [137]
No note, no explanation—just the box, and the way its colors bled when the light hit them just right, like a memory refusing to stay still. [166]
Elara had spent the morning prying open its rusted hinge, her breath shallow, her pulse a metronome counting down to something she couldn’t name. [192]

Sidereal patience, her grandmother had called it—the art of waiting for the stars to align before making your move. [216]
Elara had never been good at waiting. [223]
But the box had changed that. [228]
Inside, nestled in velvet the color of dried violets, was a single silver key and a scrap of paper with a date: the pause of migrating geese, when the sky held its breath between autumn and winter. [266]
That was today. [270]

She stood, the box tucked under her arm, and let the breadcrumbs lead her. [286]
They were subtle at first—a chipped cobblestone here, a wrought-iron gate left ajar there—but soon they formed a path, winding through the city’s veins like a secret only she could see. [326]
Her grandmother had taught her to read the world this way, to find the stories no one else bothered to look for. [352]
Elara had always been realistically imaginative, able to conjure entire histories from a single cracked tile or the way a shadow pooled at the base of a statue. [384]

The breadcrumbs led her to the city’s heart, where the grandest fountain of all stood, its basin filled not with water but with layers of fallen leaves. [418]
At its center, a figure knelt, their back to her, fingers sifting through the detritus. [438]
“You’re late,” they said without turning. [445]
Elara recognized the voice—it was the same one that had whispered to her in dreams, the same one that had slipped into her thoughts like a thief. [474]

“I didn’t know I was expected,” she replied, her tone a defiant hush, the kind of quiet that dared the world to speak back. [503]
The figure stood, brushing dirt from their knees, and turned to face her. [519]
It was her grandmother—or what was left of her, a woman woven from moonlight and the echoes of old laughter. [544]
“You were always expected,” the apparition said. [555]
“But not by me.” [559]

The grandmother smiled, sad and knowing. [566]
“Memories don’t stay trapped forever, Elara. [576]
They find their way out, one way or another.” [589]
She gestured to the stained glass box. [596]
“That’s why I left it for you. [604]
To unstick what’s been locked away.” [612]

Elara’s hands trembled. [616]
“You died before you could tell me everything.” [626]
“And you were too afraid to ask.” [633]
The grandmother’s form flickered, like a candle in a draft. [645]
“But memories aren’t just stories, child. [655]
They’re anchors. [657]
And yours have been dragging you under.” [666]

Elara looked down at the key in her palm. [675]
It was cold, but not unkind. [681]
“What do I do?” [686]
“Follow the breadcrumbs,” her grandmother said. [696]
“But this time, leave some of your own.” [707]

The apparition dissolved into the air, leaving only the faintest shimmer, like sunlight on water. [728]
Elara knelt beside the fountain and pressed the key into the lock hidden beneath the leaves. [748]
It turned with a click, and the ground beneath her shuddered. [762]
The fountain’s basin split open, revealing a spiral staircase descending into darkness. [782]

She took a breath, then another, and stepped forward. [794]
The stairs were slick with damp, the air thick with the scent of earth and something older—something like regret, like relief. [824]
At the bottom, a door waited, its surface etched with the same constellations as the stained glass box. [847]
Elara pushed it open. [852]

Inside, the room was filled with light. [859]
