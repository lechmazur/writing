The curator stood in the center of the gallery, her fingers trembling over the glass case that held the pistachio shell cameo blank. [18]
It was the only object in the room that refused to reveal its purpose, its smooth surface catching the dim light like a whisper of something forgotten. [44]
She had spent years cataloging artifacts from the astral orchard blossoming on the lonely asteroid—each petal a fragment of time, each fruit a memory—but this tiny, uncarved shell baffled her. [85]

The orchard itself was a marvel, its trees rooted in the asteroid’s cracked surface, their branches twisting toward a sky that held no sun, only the faint glow of distant stars. [124]
Visitors rarely came here, and those who did left unsettled, as if the orchard’s beauty was a veneer over something far stranger. [153]
The curator had always assumed the pistachio shell was a mistake, a misplaced trinket from some long-dead artisan. [176]
But today, as she traced its edges, she felt the weight of nonlinear inheritance pressing against her ribs. [198]

Her predecessor had left no notes about it, only a cryptic margin scribble in the ledger: *"Some things are simply complicated."* [225]
The phrase had haunted her for months, a riddle without an answer. [240]
She had tried to ignore it, focusing instead on the orchard’s more tangible wonders—the way the blossoms hummed when touched, the way the fruit ripened in reverse. [270]
But the shell remained, stubborn and silent, a puzzle that refused to be solved by logic. [290]

That evening, she locked the gallery and retreated to the bathroom, the only place in her quarters where the walls didn’t echo with the orchard’s disquieting hum. [323]
The tub was filled with water drawn from the asteroid’s underground springs, its surface shimmering with the same faint starlight that bathed the orchard. [353]
She sank into it, letting the warmth seep into her bones, and for the first time in years, she allowed herself to *inquire*—not with her hands, but with her mind. [388]

What if the shell wasn’t an object, but a vessel? [400]
What if its emptiness was the point? [408]
The thought struck her like a spark, and suddenly, the pieces of her life—her obsession with the orchard, her predecessor’s silence, the way the trees seemed to remember things that hadn’t happened yet—snapped into place. [456]
Nonlinear inheritance wasn’t about passing things down; it was about passing things *up*, through time, through memory, through the gaps between moments. [490]
The shell wasn’t blank—it was waiting. [500]

She bolted upright, water sloshing over the rim of the tub. [512]
The orchard’s blossoms had always been a record, she realized, but not of the past. [533]
They were a ledger of possibilities, of choices not yet made, of knowledge that existed beyond the edges of what was allowed. [566]
And the shell—oh, the shell was the key. [578]

She dried herself hastily and dressed, her heart pounding with the kind of brightened disquiet that comes from staring into the abyss and finding it staring back. [615]
The gallery was empty when she returned, the pistachio shell still resting in its case, its surface now seeming to pulse with potential. [646]
She reached for it, her fingers brushing the glass, and the moment she did, the orchard outside the window *shifted*. [672]
The trees bent toward her, their blossoms unfurling into shapes she almost recognized—symbols, warnings, a language that existed between the first and last page of every story. [711]

The curator understood then why her predecessor had never written anything down. [730]
Some knowledge wasn’t meant to be recorded; it was meant to be *lived*, to be inherited in fragments, to be pieced together only when the time was right. [766]
She smiled, her bewilderment giving way to something like awe. [781]
The shell was hers now, not to own, but to *pursue*. [795]
And the orchard, with all its brightened disquiet, was no longer a mystery to solve—it was a path to walk. [827]
