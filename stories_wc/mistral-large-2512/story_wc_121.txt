The first time Elias defied gravity, he did it by accident. [10]
He had been running along the glowing viaduct, its wet stones shimmering under the pale light of a storm-cleared sky, when his foot caught on a loose slab. [35]
Instead of falling, he floated—just for a second—before the world snapped back into place with a sound like breaking glass. [60]
Elias landed hard, his breath knocked out of him, but the memory of that weightless instant lingered, a secret he couldn’t shake. [83]

The viaduct stretched between two cliffs, its arches humming with an energy that wasn’t quite light, wasn’t quite sound. [106]
Locals called it the Bridge of Echoes, though no one could agree on what it echoed. [122]
Elias had come here to escape the whispers in his own mind, the ones that told him he was fractured—split between who he was and who he might have been. [150]
But the viaduct didn’t offer escape. [155]
It offered a mirror. [158]

Beneath the bridge, half-buried in the mud, he found the clay tablet. [171]
Its surface was etched with runes that shifted when he looked at them, rearranging themselves into patterns his eyes couldn’t hold. [191]
He wiped the grime away with his sleeve, and the moment his fingers brushed the symbols, the world flickered. [213]
For a heartbeat, he saw another version of himself—older, scarred, standing in the same spot with a sword at his hip. [237]
Then the vision was gone, leaving only the tablet and the weight of something unsaid. [254]

Elias knew then what he had to do. [261]
The labyrinth of self wasn’t a place you walked into—it was a place you fell into, again and again. [281]
And if he wanted to conquer it, he’d have to retrace every path he’d ever taken, every choice he’d ever made. [304]
The tablet was the key. [310]

He pressed his palm to the runes, and the viaduct dissolved. [321]
The world around him unfolded like a map drawn by a mad cartographer, streets and alleys branching into infinite permutations. [346]
This was procedural generation, not of code, but of time—each decision he’d ever made spawning new timelines, new versions of himself. [370]
Somewhere in the maze was the truth. [377]

Elias stepped forward, and the ground beneath him rippled. [387]
He was between the drop and the ripple now, suspended in the moment before impact, before consequence. [408]
The air smelled of ozone and wet stone, the same as it had on the viaduct, but thicker, heavier. [429]
He could feel the weight of every version of himself pressing in, their memories bleeding into his. [450]

A voice, not his own, whispered: *"You are periodically eternal."* [460]
He turned, but there was no one there—only the echoes of his other selves, calling from the fractures. [480]
One had died young, another had lived a life of quiet regret, a third had become something monstrous. [502]
Elias clenched his fists. [506]
He wouldn’t let them define him. [512]

The labyrinth shifted again, and he found himself standing before a door. [526]
It was made of the same glowing stone as the viaduct, its surface carved with the same runes as the tablet. [544]
He reached out, and the moment his fingers touched the handle, the door swung open. [560]
Inside was a version of himself—older, scarred, the one from the vision. [575]
The man smiled, but it wasn’t kind. [581]
*"You’ve come to kill me,"* he said. [588]

Elias hesitated. [591]
This wasn’t the confrontation he’d expected. [597]
The man stepped forward, and the room around them flickered, revealing glimpses of other timelines—some where Elias had won, some where he’d lost, some where he’d never existed at all. [635]
*"You can’t conquer the labyrinth,"* the man said. [643]
*"But you can choose which version of yourself gets to walk out."* [657]

Elias understood then. [661]
The tablet hadn’t been a key—it had been a warning. [671]
The labyrinth wasn’t a puzzle to solve; it was a choice to make. [686]
He looked at the man, at the scars on his hands, the weight in his eyes. [701]
This was what happened when you tried to outrun yourself. [712]

He let go of the door. [717]
The labyrinth collapsed around him, timelines unraveling like threads. [730]
The last thing he saw was the viaduct, its glow dimming as the rain began to fall again. [750]
He was back where he’d started, but he wasn’t the same. [762]

The tablet was gone. [766]
The runes had faded, leaving only smooth clay. [777]
Elias knelt in the mud, breathing hard. [784]
The whispers in his mind were quieter now, as if they’d been drowned out by the sound of rain. [805]
He stood, and for the first time in years, he didn’t feel fractured. [819]
He felt whole. [822]
The labyrinth was still there, but so was the way out. [830]
