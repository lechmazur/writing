The first time Liora saw the lighthouse lens fragment, it was nestled in the palm of an old alchemist who smelled of salt and burnt sugar. [18]
She had climbed the swaying rope bridges of the alchemist’s market not for ingredients, but for stories—the kind that slipped between worlds like mist through cracks. [45]
The fragment, no larger than a thumbnail, glowed faintly in the dim light of the market stalls, its edges jagged as if torn from something vast and broken. [76]
“It remembers the sea,” the alchemist murmured, his voice rough as barnacle-encrusted wood. [92]
Liora’s fingers twitched toward it, not out of greed, but recognition. [102]
She was a between-worlds translator, after all—someone who listened to the echoes of places that no longer existed and gave them shape in words. [128]
But this fragment wasn’t just an echo. [134]
It was an anchor. [137]

Her childhood had been a blur of half-remembered ports and the scent of brine, her father’s voice weaving tales of ships that sailed not on water, but on intuition. [163]
“Some things are elusively tangible,” he’d say, tapping his temple. [172]
“You feel them before you see them.” [177]
She had never understood until now. [181]
The fragment hummed against her skin when she pressed it to her wrist, a vibration that traveled up her arm like a memory returning. [206]
The alchemist watched her, his milky eyes sharp. [215]
“You’re not the first to seek it,” he said. [223]
“But you might be the first who knows what it’s for.” [233]

Liora’s motivation had always been simple: to honor overlooked histories. [244]
The ones that didn’t make it into books, the ones carried in the calloused hands of sailors or the whispered prayers of lighthouse keepers. [265]
This fragment was one of those histories, a piece of a lens that had once guided ships through storms not by light, but by something deeper. [290]
She unfastened the clasp of her satchel, tucking the fragment beside her notebook, where it pulsed faintly against the leather. [313]

The market was a labyrinth of suspended stalls, their wares strung from the rafters like offerings to a sky that never quite touched the ground. [340]
Liora moved through it as if in a dream, the eternal instant of the place wrapping around her—time here didn’t flow so much as pool, deep and still. [368]
She stopped at a stall where an artist painted in layers, his brushstrokes revealing hidden details only when the light hit them just right. [392]
“What do you see?” he asked, not looking up. [400]
Liora leaned in. [403]
The painting was of a lighthouse, but not as it stood now—its base was submerged, its beam cutting through water instead of air. [431]
“A drowned one,” she breathed. [436]
The artist smiled. [439]
“Some say the lens shattered when the sea took it. [450]
Others say it was never meant to stay whole.” [459]

She spent the next hour tracing the edges of the painting, her fingers following the faint lines of a map only she could see. [485]
The artist watched, amused. [490]
“You’re looking for the rest of it,” he said. [498]
Liora nodded. [500]
“Not just the lens. [504]
The stories it carried.” [510]

That night, she unfastened the shutters of her attic room, letting the city’s glow spill across her desk. [533]
The fragment lay beside her notebook, its light flickering like a heartbeat. [546]
She wrote until her fingers cramped, the words pouring out of her as if the fragment itself were dictating. [568]
The lighthouse hadn’t fallen—it had been pulled under, not by the sea, but by the weight of the stories it held. [591]
Stories of sailors who had seen things in its beam that couldn’t be explained, of storms that parted like curtains at its touch. [618]
Stories no one had believed. [623]

Liora knew then that her work wasn’t just translation. [633]
It was retrieval. [635]
The fragment was an anchor, but not to the past—to the present, to the moment where intuition and history tangled like roots beneath the earth. [668]
She fastened it into a silver locket, pressing it to her chest. [681]
The vibration steadied, a quiet hum that felt like coming home. [697]

The next morning, she returned to the market, the locket hidden beneath her shirt. [714]
The alchemist was gone, his stall empty save for a single painting left behind—a lighthouse beam cutting through the dark, its light revealing a ship that wasn’t there. [747]
Liora smiled. [750]
Some stories were meant to be found in pieces. [759]
Some were meant to stay elusively tangible, just out of reach. [770]
But that was the point. [775]
The searching was the honoring. [781]
And she would keep searching. [787]
[788]
