The tidal arbor above the clouds was a place of quiet contradictions. [10]
Its branches, thick as ancient ship masts, swayed not with wind but with the slow pulse of the ocean far below, its waves invisible yet ever-present in the creak of wood and the salt-tinged mist that curled around the pianist’s fingers. [46]
Elias had played here for seventeen years, his music drifting like smoke through the hollows of the arbor, each note a fragile bridge between the sky and the sea. [82]
Tonight, though, his fingers hesitated over the keys. [90]

The broken anniversary clock sat on the edge of the piano, its brass hands frozen at 3:17. [106]
It had stopped the day his wife left, boarding a sky-ferry to the eastern archipelagos, her laughter still echoing in the empty rooms of their cliffside home. [136]
Elias had wound it every morning since, not to keep time, but to remember the way her voice had sounded when she’d called it "our little heart." [166]
Now, its silence was louder than any metronome. [174]

Outside, the compasses of passing travelers flickered wildly, their needles spinning like drunken dancers. [190]
No one knew why the arbor disrupted them—some whispered of magnetic storms, others of old gods buried in the roots. [212]
Elias didn’t care. [215]
The chaos suited him. [218]
It was the only thing that made sense anymore. [226]

He was a strategically creative man, or so his wife had once teased. [239]
She’d meant it as a compliment, back when his oddities amused her: the way he’d rearrange furniture to catch the light just right, or how he’d compose melodies based on the rhythm of rain on the roof. [275]
Now, that creativity was a lifeline. [282]
He needed it to pull off what he was about to do. [291]

The idea had come to him through hidden sections in a black-and-white film reel. [308]
He’d found it in the arbor’s underbelly, tucked between the roots where the tide’s fingers couldn’t reach. [328]
The film was a travelogue, grainy and scratched, showing a pianist in a coastal village who’d played an encore so unexpected it had summoned a storm. [358]
The villagers had called it a miracle. [364]
Elias called it a loophole. [369]

He would take refuge in that loophole. [376]
Not from the world, but from the weight of his own grief. [388]
The arbor was the perfect stage—high enough to be seen, isolated enough to be heard. [407]
And if the compasses were any sign, the world was already unraveling at the edges. [426]
Why not give it a push? [432]

His fingers found the keys again, not with the practiced ease of his usual nocturnes, but with the deliberate clumsiness of a man testing ice. [458]
He played a scale, then another, letting the sound rise like smoke through the arbor’s branches. [478]
Below, the clouds shifted, revealing glimpses of the ocean, its surface dark as spilled ink. [497]

Until the horizon invites night, he had told himself. [506]
That was the rule. [510]
No matter how long the day stretched, no matter how the light clung to the edges of the sky, he would wait. [534]
The encore had to be a surprise, not just to the world, but to fate itself. [552]

The first traveler arrived just as the sun bled into the horizon. [566]
A sky-sailor, her compass spinning uselessly in her palm, her face pale with exhaustion. [585]
She collapsed onto the arbor’s platform, her breath ragged. [596]
Elias didn’t stop playing. [600]

Others followed—a merchant with a cargo of flickering lanterns, a child chasing a runaway kite, a pair of lovers who’d lost their way in the compass storms. [633]
They gathered around the piano like moths to a flame, their eyes wide, their voices hushed. [653]
Elias played on, the music swelling, the arbor groaning beneath them as if the tide itself were rising. [679]

Then, the horizon swallowed the last sliver of light. [691]
The arbor plunged into twilight, the only illumination coming from the bioluminescent moss clinging to the branches. [718]
Elias took a deep breath. [724]

This was the moment. [728]
He lifted his hands from the keys, let the final note hang in the air like a question. [748]
Then, without warning, he launched into a piece he’d never played before—a wild, discordant thing, full of sharp edges and sudden silences. [778]
It was the sound of a man throwing himself off a cliff, trusting the wind to catch him. [800]

The travelers gasped. [803]
The arbor trembled. [806]
And then, as if summoned by the music, the clouds below parted, revealing the ocean in all its furious, moonlit glory. [834]
Waves crashed against the arbor’s roots, sending spray high enough to mist Elias’s face. [855]
The compasses in the crowd stilled. [861]

For the first time in years, the broken anniversary clock on the piano began to tick. [878]
