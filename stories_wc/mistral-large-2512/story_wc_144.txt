The mist curled around the iron girders of the old rail depot like a living thing, softening the clatter of tools and the distant clang of the shipyard. [23]
Elias Veyra stood at the center of his repair shop, fingers tracing the edge of a cracked ceramic plate, his breath steady despite the weight of the moment. [54]
The air smelled of salt and machine oil, a scent that had become his compass in the years since he lost his sight. [81]
Around him, the hum of the artificial hummingbird drone—his most delicate creation—filled the silence with a quiet, rhythmic pulse. [111]

It had been three months since the drone’s last flight, its wings snagged on a loose cable during a storm. [135]
Elias had spent every evening since then patching its fractured frame, his touch the only guide he needed to mend what others couldn’t see. [161]
The depot’s water feature, a shallow basin where rainwater pooled and refracted the dim light, was his secret—examining the way the ripples bent the glow told him more than any blueprint ever could. [198]
Tonight, though, the basin was still, its surface a mirror reflecting the flicker of the dockside lanterns. [223]

A voice cut through the mist. [228]
“They’re raising the anchor,” Mara said, her boots scuffing against the concrete. [245]
Elias didn’t turn, but his fingers stilled on the drone’s wing. [260]
The ship’s maiden voyage was beginning, and with it, the last chance to decode the feedback from the drone’s final flight. [286]
The data had been erratic, a pattern of stutters and gaps that no one else could interpret. [307]

Mara stepped closer, her shadow falling across the water. [321]
“You’re sure about this?” she asked, though she already knew the answer. [337]
Elias smiled, the kind of smile that came from years of trusting what he couldn’t see. [355]
“Feedback isn’t noise,” he said. [363]
“It’s direction.” [367]

He lifted the drone, its wings catching the light like stained glass. [383]
The hummingbird had been designed to map the depot’s hidden corridors, its sensors attuned to the way sound traveled through the mist. [413]
But on its last flight, it had returned with something else—a series of pulses that matched the rhythm of the anchor chain as it lifted. [448]
Elias had spent weeks listening, his hands pressed to the drone’s body, feeling the vibrations like a second heartbeat. [475]

Now, as the distant groan of the ship’s engines rumbled through the depot, he knew what he had to do. [499]
Mara handed him a tool, her fingers brushing his. [512]
“You’re not just fixing it,” she murmured. [523]
“You’re sending it home.” [530]

Elias adjusted the drone’s balance, his touch light but precise. [546]
The water feature rippled as he dipped his fingers in, testing the refraction one last time. [567]
The light bent just right, a sign he’d learned to trust. [583]
He released the hummingbird, and it darted into the mist, its wings a blur of motion. [604]

The depot fell silent again, save for the distant creak of the anchor chain. [623]
Elias stood there, blind but unshaken, overseeing the flight he couldn’t see. [643]
Mara watched him, her breath held, as the drone’s hum faded into the night. [664]

Then, a sound—soft at first, then growing louder. [679]
The hummingbird returned, its wings glinting as it landed on Elias’s outstretched palm. [699]
He didn’t need to see it to know it had succeeded. [714]
The feedback was clear now, a steady pulse that matched the rhythm of the ship’s departure. [736]

Mara exhaled, her voice thick with something like awe. [748]
“You were right,” she said. [754]
Elias closed his fingers around the drone, his heart full. [766]
“Some things don’t need eyes to be seen.” [779]

The mist settled over the depot, calm and magnetic, as the ship vanished into the horizon. [798]
Elias turned back to his work, the hummingbird’s wings still humming softly in his hand. [816]
