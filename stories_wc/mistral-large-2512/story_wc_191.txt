The last lore keeper of the Neon Grove, Veyra, adjusted the cracked lenses of her goggles as the kaleidoscopic waterfall roared before her. [23]
Its prismatic sheets shifted like liquid stained glass, refracting the dim glow of bioluminescent vines that clung to the cliffs above. [48]
She had spent decades deciphering the fragmented texts of the Old Architects, but none had mentioned this place—the hidden orchard whispered of in half-burned scrolls. [86]
Her boots sank into the damp earth as she stepped through the cascading veil, the water parting just enough to reveal a grove of silver-leafed trees, their fruit pulsing with an inner light. [129]
Veyra exhaled, her breath misting in the cool air. [139]
This was no mere ruin; it was a threshold. [148]

She had come for the unclaimed throne, not out of greed, but because the world was unraveling without its rightful steward. [176]
The last monarch, Queen Solara, had vanished centuries ago, leaving behind only a cryptic warning: *"The stairway of ascension reveals itself only to the wisely adventurous."* [210]
Veyra had spent her life embodying that phrase—knowing when to leap and when to listen. [232]
Now, she sallied forward, her fingers brushing the bark of the nearest tree. [248]
A ruby flake, no larger than a fingernail, detached itself and drifted into her palm. [266]
It hummed faintly, as if alive. [273]

The orchard was silent, save for the distant chime of wind through the branches. [289]
Veyra knelt, pressing the flake to the mossy ground. [302]
The earth rippled, and a section of the trunk split open, revealing a spiral staircase descending into darkness. [327]
Her pulse quickened. [332]
This was it—the stairway of ascension, hidden in plain sight. [347]

But the Old Architects had been tricksters. [355]
She recalled the warnings: *"Beware the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals."* [374]
Veyra hesitated, then pulled a small knife from her belt. [387]
She scraped at the bark of the nearest tree, peeling back the silver sheen like old parchment. [412]
Beneath it, a mural emerged—a map of the grove, but not as it was now. [434]
It showed the orchard in full bloom, the trees heavy with fruit, and at its center, a throne of woven roots. [462]
The throne was empty. [466]

The mural shifted as she watched, the paint seeming to melt and reform. [484]
The trees vanished, replaced by a city of glass and steel, its spires piercing the sky. [505]
Then, just as suddenly, the image faded, leaving only the silver bark. [522]
Veyra understood. [525]
The throne was not a seat of power—it was a test. [539]
The Old Architects had designed it to be claimed only by those who saw beyond the surface. [558]

She descended the staircase, the ruby flake glowing brighter in her grip. [575]
The air grew warmer, thick with the scent of ozone and old magic. [590]
At the bottom, a chamber opened before her, its walls covered in murals far more intricate than the one outside. [618]
They depicted the rise and fall of civilizations, each layer of paint telling a different story. [642]
Veyra traced her fingers over them, feeling the weight of time. [660]

At the center of the chamber stood the throne, not of gold or stone, but of living wood, its roots twisting into the earth. [692]
Veyra approached, her steps echoing. [702]
The ruby flake in her hand pulsed once, then dissolved into light. [718]
The throne shimmered, its surface rippling like water. [730]

She sat. [733]
The moment her weight settled, the chamber trembled. [746]
The murals flared to life, their colors bleeding into the air like ink in water. [766]
The stories they told unfolded around her—the birth of stars, the fall of empires, the quiet moments in between. [794]
Veyra closed her eyes, feeling the weight of the unclaimed throne settle onto her shoulders. [820]

When she opened them, the orchard was bathed in the first light of dawn. [837]
The waterfall still shimmered, but now it carried the promise of a new era. [856]
She had until sunrise to decide what to do next. [869]
But for the first time in centuries, the throne had an heir. [884]
