The painter had not slept in three nights, not since the smog rolled in thick as wool over the city, sealing the rooftops in a sour yellow haze. [23]
Her greenhouse perched above the din of the streets, a fragile glass bubble where the air still carried the scent of wet earth and crushed mint. [48]
She had built it herself, board by board, sealing the panes with putty mixed from her own spit and stubbornness. [72]
Now, she stood at the easel, fingers trembling not from fatigue but from the weight of the calligrapher’s moon-tipped brush resting in her palm. [101]
It was an old thing, its bristles stiff with dried ink, the handle carved from bone that had once caught the light of a different sky. [128]
She had found it in a junk shop near the river, tucked between a rusted tin of watercolors and a stack of ledgers written in a script no living soul could read. [158]
The shopkeeper had called it a relic of lost languages, a tool for words that had no home in the world anymore. [181]
The painter didn’t care about the words. [187]
She cared about the way the brush’s tip held moonlight like a secret, how it glowed faintly in the dark, as if remembering the hands that had wielded it before. [225]

She dipped it into the inkwell, the liquid black as the space between stars. [239]
The first stroke was always the hardest—her wrist locking, her breath shallow, as if the brush itself was judging her. [262]
But then the ink would flow, and the world would narrow to the whisper of bristles on paper. [281]
Tonight, she painted the faces of strangers. [290]
Not the ones she saw on the streets, hollow-cheeked and hurried, but the ones she dreamed of when the moon was waxing, when the smog thinned just enough to let the light through. [327]
In her daydreams, they were vivid: the old woman who had pressed a coin into her hand when she was a child, the bus driver who had waited an extra minute so she wouldn’t miss her stop, the boy who had shared his umbrella in the rain. [373]
She painted them methodically, hopefully, as if each stroke could call them back from the edges of memory. [398]

The greenhouse was warm, the glass panes fogged with her breath. [411]
Outside, the city groaned, a beast digesting its own filth. [423]
But here, under the waxing moon’s glow, the air hummed with something like possibility. [445]
She had read once that kindness was a language, one that didn’t need words to be understood. [464]
The thought had lodged in her chest like a seed. [473]
What if it wasn’t lost, not really? [480]
What if it was just waiting for someone to remember how to speak it? [495]

She set down the brush, her fingers smudged with ink. [505]
The faces on the paper stared back at her, not quite real but not quite imagined either. [523]
She had spent years chasing sleep, but it was the waking dreams that had saved her. [541]
The moonlight had roused something in her—not just the brush, but the quiet certainty that the world was still kind, even when it forgot. [572]

She rolled up the paintings, tying them with twine. [582]
Tomorrow, she would leave them in places where strangers might find them: on park benches, tucked into library books, propped against the base of the old clock tower. [613]
Maybe they would recognize themselves in the strokes. [624]
Maybe they would remember, too. [631]

The moon climbed higher, its light spilling through the greenhouse roof like liquid silver. [650]
The painter closed her eyes, letting the glow warm her face. [664]
She wasn’t tired. [667]
Not anymore. [670]
