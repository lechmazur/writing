The silo had been a grain elevator once, its concrete ribs still smelling of old wheat and rust. [15]
Now it stood hollowed out, shelves spiraling up its curved walls like the inside of a nautilus shell, each one cradling books that no one alive would ever read again. [48]
Dr. Elara Voss had chosen it for its silence, the way the air inside settled like dust on a bronze plate. [76]

She was an odd historian, not by choice but by necessity. [86]
The past had become a language only she could still hear, its words whispered in the creak of floorboards and the sigh of wind through broken panes. [119]
Her fingers, always slightly stained with ink or ash, traced the spines of books as if they were pulse points. [142]

The fragment of medieval tapestry had been tucked between the pages of a ledger, its threads stiff with age. [164]
Dragons coiled across it in faded crimson and gold, their scales catching the dim light like scattered coins. [187]
Elara had found it two winters ago, or perhaps three—time had grown slippery since the last human dream was dreamt. [215]

She didn’t know why the dragons mattered, only that they did. [226]
Their bodies were woven in a pattern that didn’t repeat, as if the weaver had been trying to map something that couldn’t be contained in loops and knots. [258]
Elara spread the fragment across her desk, the tapestry’s edges curling like dying leaves. [276]

The displaced axis was what had drawn her here, to this silo, to this quiet. [291]
Not the Earth’s tilt, but something older, something that had unspooled the moment the last dreamer closed their eyes for the final time. [324]
She had felt it first in the way shadows pooled too long in corners, in the way her own reflection sometimes flickered like a candle in a draft. [358]

The half-burned diaries had been stacked in the fireplace, their pages singed but not consumed. [377]
Someone had tried to erase them, but fire had only made them more stubborn, their words rising from the ashes like ghosts. [408]
Elara probed them carefully, her breath shallow, as if the paper might crumble at the weight of her attention. [436]

One entry read: *The walls remember. They hum when no one is listening.* [454]
Another: *I saw the dragons move. Not in the tapestry—they were in the stone, in the grain of the wood.* [483]
The last, barely legible: *The axis is slipping. We are all falling sideways.* [503]

Elara’s motivation had always been simple: to collect the stories walls have heard. [523]
But the diaries made her wonder if the walls had been listening to something else entirely. [545]
Something that had been singing to them since before humans learned to build. [565]

She pressed her palm to the silo’s concrete, feeling the vibration of it, the slow, deep thrum of a structure that had outlasted its purpose. [598]
The tapestry fragment shivered under her other hand, as if responding. [615]
The dragons’ eyes, once flat and threadbare, now gleamed faintly, like embers stirred by a breath. [641]

Elara was sensitively perceptive, attuned to the cracks in the world where meaning leaked through. [662]
She had spent her life chasing those cracks, but now she wondered if she had been following them in the wrong direction. [692]
What if the stories weren’t behind her, in the past, but ahead, in the spaces between the threads? [723]

The silo groaned, its bones shifting in the wind. [735]
She looked up, and for a moment, the shelves seemed to tilt, the books sliding toward her as if pulled by an unseen current. [766]
The tapestry’s dragons lifted their heads, their woven bodies unraveling just enough to let her see the space beyond. [797]

It wasn’t a pattern. [803]
It was a door. [806]
And the axis wasn’t displaced—it had always been pointing somewhere else. [827]

Elara reached out, her fingers brushing the threads. [840]
The last human dream had been the key, not the end. [854]
And the walls had been waiting for someone to listen. [868]
