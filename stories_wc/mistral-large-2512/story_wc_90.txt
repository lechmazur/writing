The recycled spaceship *Euthymia* drifted in the void, its hull patched with scavenged plating and its corridors lined with the ghosts of a thousand forgotten lives. [20]
Inside, Liora moved through the dim glow of bioluminescent algae, her bare feet barely touching the floor—she had been happy this morning, and the ship’s artificial gravity struggled to keep her grounded. [56]
She was the last steadfast pacifist, a relic of a time when humanity still believed in mercy, though mercy had long since abandoned them. [87]

The *Euthymia* had once been a colony vessel, then a prison, then a refugee ark, and now it was something else entirely: a floating reliquary of human regret. [118]
Liora’s task was to stitch its wounds—not with thread, but with memory. [132]
She carried Kwan Yin’s Tear in a locket around her neck, a droplet of liquid starlight said to hold the weight of every sorrow ever wept. [158]
It was the key, or so the whispers in the static claimed. [170]

The locked dimension wasn’t a place so much as a silence, a pocket of the universe where time had folded in on itself. [194]
To push it open, she had to confront the shadows—the ones inside her, the ones clinging to the *Euthymia* like barnacles. [217]
Shadow work, the old texts called it. [224]
Liora called it necessary. [227]

She began in the ship’s heart, where the engine’s hum was a dying pulse. [243]
The walls were papered with faded photographs, their edges curling, their subjects long turned to dust. [260]
She traced the shimmer of long-dried tears on the faces in the images, the residue of grief that had crystallized over centuries. [285]
Each one was a door. [290]

The first photograph showed a child clutching a stuffed bear, its button eyes missing. [308]
Liora pressed her palm to the image, and the ship groaned as if waking from a dream. [326]
The child’s voice echoed in her mind: *You left me behind.* [337]
She didn’t flinch. [340]
"I’m here now," she said, and stitched the memory into the ship’s skin with a needle of light, the thread pulled from Kwan Yin’s Tear. [371]

The next photograph was of a soldier, his face half-erased by time. [386]
*You killed me,* he accused. [392]
Liora’s hands didn’t shake. [396]
"I carry your weight," she replied, and the needle flashed again. [410]

By the time she reached the last image—a woman holding a newborn, her smile brittle with exhaustion—Liora’s feet no longer touched the floor at all. [444]
The ship’s gravity had loosened its grip on her, but the dimension’s door remained shut. [463]
The woman in the photo whispered, *You were supposed to save us.* [478]
Liora’s breath hitched. [482]
"I’m trying," she said, and the needle trembled in her fingers. [496]

The last human had been born centuries ago, but the *Euthymia* remembered. [514]
It remembered every scream, every plea, every life snuffed out in the dark. [532]
Liora stitched them all into the ship’s bones, and with each suture, the air grew thinner, the shadows deeper. [557]

Then, the locket grew warm against her chest. [567]
Kwan Yin’s Tear was responding. [573]
The dimension’s lock wasn’t a physical thing—it was a wound, a place where the universe had bled out. [596]
To open it, she had to become the wound. [607]

Liora pressed the locket to the photograph of the woman and child. [622]
The liquid starlight seeped into the image, and the ship shuddered. [638]
The shadows peeled back like skin. [645]

For a moment, there was only silence. [655]
Then, the dimension groaned open, a gash of light in the dark. [671]
Liora didn’t step through. [676]
She had pushed it open, but she wasn’t the one who needed to enter. [693]

The *Euthymia* did. [696]
The ship, now stitched together with every sorrow it had ever carried, drifted forward, its hull unraveling into the light. [724]
Liora watched as the recycled metal, the photographs, the ghosts—all of it dissolved into the wound she had made. [749]

She was alone again, but lighter than she had ever been. [762]
The locket was empty. [766]
The dimension sealed behind the *Euthymia*, and Liora floated there, smiling. [783]

Somewhere, a child laughed. [788]
Somewhere, a soldier laid down his gun. [798]
Somewhere, a mother held her baby and wept, but not in sorrow. [818]

Liora closed her eyes. [822]
The ship was gone, but the work was done. [830]
