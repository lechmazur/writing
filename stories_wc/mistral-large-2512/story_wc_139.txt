The prep room smelled of formaldehyde and old roses, a scent that clung to Elias like a second skin. [16]
He wasn’t supposed to be here—not really—but the funeral home had been his mother’s last con, and now it was his. [40]
Not that he ran scams; he just kept the books, balanced the ledgers, and tried to ignore the way the dead watched him from their steel tables. [73]
Tonight, though, the dead weren’t his problem. [82]
The ink pot was. [86]

It sat on the corner of the embalming counter, a squat thing of black glass with a chipped gold rim, the kind of antique that belonged in a scholar’s study, not a place where corpses were drained of blood. [133]
Elias had found it tucked inside the pocket of a man who’d died mid-escape, his body smuggled in by a panicked diplomat. [162]
The man had been seeking asylum, or so the paperwork claimed, but the ink pot suggested something else. [183]
Diplomats didn’t carry heirlooms to their deaths. [193]
Con artists did. [197]

Elias turned the pot in his hands, the glass cool and smooth. [211]
His mother had taught him that every object had a story, and the best cons were just stories people wanted to believe. [238]
This one smelled like desperation. [244]
He uncorked it, dipped a finger inside, and pulled out a smear of ink so dark it seemed to drink the light. [268]
It didn’t dry. [271]
It stayed liquid, shifting like oil on water, and when he pressed his thumb to the counter, the ink spread in fractal patterns, branching into equations he almost recognized. [312]

A fair trade, his mother had always said, was just math with a human face. [332]
But this wasn’t math. [336]
This was something else—something that liquefied rigid thinking, that turned rules into suggestions and borders into suggestions. [363]
The diplomat hadn’t been running from a government. [372]
He’d been running from a system, and the ink pot was his key. [387]

Elias heard footsteps in the hall. [394]
Not the slow, deliberate tread of the night watchman, but the sharp, uneven rhythm of someone who didn’t belong. [424]
He corked the pot and slid it into his pocket just as the door creaked open. [446]
A woman stood there, her face half-hidden by a scarf, her eyes darting like a trapped thing. [469]
“You’re the undertaker’s boy,” she said. [478]
“And you’re trespassing,” Elias replied. [485]

She didn’t flinch. [488]
“I need what he had.” [494]
“The body?” [497]
“The pot.” [500]

Elias exhaled through his nose. [506]
Of course. [508]
The dead man hadn’t been the mark. [516]
The ink pot had. [520]
And now she was here to collect, because in the world of cons, nothing was ever just an object. [546]
It was always a breach waiting to happen. [555]

“Why?” he asked. [559]
She hesitated, then tugged the scarf down. [567]
Her face was a map of old bruises, her lip split fresh. [579]
“Because my brother is in a cell three countries away, and the only way out is if I prove the numbers are wrong.” [613]
Elias understood then. [618]
The ink pot wasn’t just a tool. [625]
It was a weapon against a system that had calcified into cruelty, a way to rewrite the ledger of power. [653]

He should have handed it over. [660]
He was his mother’s son, after all. [668]
But he’d spent his life watching her bend the world to her will, and he’d spent just as long wondering what it would look like if someone bent it back. [710]
“Prove it,” he said. [715]

The woman blinked. [718]
“What?” [720]
“Prove the numbers are wrong.” [728]
“With what?” [731]
Elias pulled the ink pot from his pocket and set it on the counter between them. [750]
“By waiting actively,” he said. [757]

The ink inside shimmered, as if it had been listening. [770]
The woman reached for it, then stopped. [778]
“This isn’t how it works,” she said. [787]
“No,” Elias agreed. [790]
“But it’s how it starts.” [797]

Outside, the city hummed with the deathly vitality of a world that refused to stay buried. [825]
And in the prep room, where the dead waited and the living schemed, something new began to take shape. [852]
[853]
