The half-masked line walker stepped onto the murmuring pavilion, the wooden slats groaning beneath his weight as if sharing secrets with the wind. [18]
His mask, carved from driftwood and painted with faded symbols, covered only the left side of his face, leaving the right exposed—a balance between concealment and truth. [47]
The pavilion stretched across the dunes like a skeletal hand, its pillars humming with the voices of those who had walked it before, their whispers preserved in the grain. [83]
After the prophet arrives, the line walkers had been instructed to listen not with their ears, but through peripheral awareness, catching the truths that slipped past direct gaze. [120]
He had come to consecrate the space, to ensure the echo of wisdom remained unbroken, though he wasn’t entirely sure what that meant yet. [149]

Beneath the dunes, the kinetic parapet pulsed faintly, its hidden mechanisms shifting sand in slow, deliberate waves. [172]
No one had built it—it had always been there, a relic of a time when the earth itself remembered how to speak. [194]
The line walker knelt, pressing his palm to the wooden floor, feeling the vibrations travel up his arm like a second heartbeat. [222]
This was where the conjured clearings appeared, pockets of stillness in the ever-shifting desert, where the air grew thick with the weight of unspoken knowledge. [255]
He had seen one once, years ago, a perfect circle of silence where the wind dared not enter, and the prophet had stood at its center, speaking in a voice that wasn’t a voice. [293]

The line walker exhaled, his breath fogging the unmasked half of his face. [308]
He was strangely honest, a trait that had both saved and doomed him in equal measure. [329]
Others lied to smooth the edges of the world, but he could only speak what he believed, even when it hurt. [354]
It was why he had been chosen for this task—not because he was the wisest, but because he was the most likely to recognize the truth when it came. [385]

A shadow flickered at the edge of his vision. [397]
Through peripheral awareness, he caught it: a figure standing where no one should be, cloaked in the same dusk-gray as the dunes. [430]
The prophet had arrived. [436]
The line walker didn’t turn to look, knowing that direct gaze would shatter the moment. [457]
Instead, he waited, letting the murmurs of the pavilion fill the silence between them. [476]

“You’ve come to consecrate the clearing,” the prophet said, though his lips didn’t move. [497]
The words settled into the line walker’s bones, bypassing his ears entirely. [515]
“Yes,” he replied, his voice steady despite the tremor in his chest. [530]
“But what does that mean?” [537]

The prophet stepped forward, his boots making no sound on the wood. [553]
“It means you must decide what to preserve,” he said. [567]
“Some echoes are louder than others. Some wisdom is a lie dressed in truth.” [589]
The line walker nodded, though he didn’t fully understand. [603]
The kinetic parapet beneath the dunes groaned, shifting as if in agreement. [620]

A conjured clearing bloomed around them, the air thickening until the pavilion’s murmurs faded into silence. [645]
The line walker’s mask grew warm against his skin, the symbols flaring with a light only he could see. [670]
“Look,” the prophet urged, gesturing to the space between them. [685]
Through peripheral awareness, the line walker saw it: a thread of golden light, thin as a spider’s silk, stretching from his mask to the prophet’s chest. [722]
“That is the echo,” the prophet said. [732]
“Your honesty keeps it alive. Your doubt keeps it pure.” [747]

The line walker reached out, his fingers brushing the thread. [760]
It hummed beneath his touch, vibrating with the weight of a thousand unspoken truths. [783]
To preserve the echo of wisdom, he realized, was not to hoard it, but to let it pass through him, unbroken and unfiltered. [813]
The pavilion sighed around them, the wood settling into a deeper stillness. [830]
The clearing would fade soon, but the thread would remain. [844]
The line walker smiled beneath his mask. [851]
