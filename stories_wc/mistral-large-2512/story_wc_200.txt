The lost soul collector stood at the edge of Echo Gorge, where the cliffs seemed to breathe with the whispers of the departed. [17]
His coat, patched with memories of a hundred forgotten names, fluttered in the damp wind that carried the scent of wet stone and old sorrow. [40]
This was his domain—not by choice, but by the weight of the souls he had failed to guide. [59]
In his pocket, the crocodile’s tooth pressed against his thigh, a relic from a time when he had been something else, something less burdened. [84]
He had found it years ago in the belly of a beast that had swallowed a child whole, and though the child had been returned, the tooth remained, a reminder of the thin line between mercy and cruelty. [125]

The sun had not yet risen, but the sky bled a hidden sunrise, a pale glow that seeped between the cracks of the world like spilled ink. [152]
It was in this hush, this fragile moment between night and day, that the spectral confessions came to him. [173]
They were not words, not exactly, but fragments of sound—laughter choked by grief, sobs twisted into something like song. [193]
They slithered through the gorge, carried by the distorted notes of a misaligned harp someone had left behind, its strings plucked by unseen hands. [221]
The collector tilted his head, listening. [227]

He had come to Echo Gorge for a reason. [235]
Not to gather souls—no, he had given up on that long ago—but to pursue something far more elusive. [258]
Laughter. [260]
Not the hollow kind, the kind that masked pain, but the real thing, the kind that could stitch a soul back together. [284]
It was his motivation now, his quiet rebellion against the weight of the dead. [299]
If he could find even one soul who still knew how to laugh, perhaps he could remember how himself. [323]

The harp’s notes grew louder, warping into something almost recognizable—a lullaby, perhaps, or a drinking song. [347]
The collector stepped forward, his boots sinking into the damp earth. [360]
He was modestly fearless, not because he lacked fear, but because he had learned to walk through it. [382]
The gorge stretched before him, its walls lined with the faces of those who had lingered too long, their expressions shifting between sorrow and something like relief. [416]

Then he saw her. [421]
A woman, or the ghost of one, sitting on a rock with her knees drawn to her chest. [441]
She was humming, but the melody was broken, the notes slipping from her lips like water through fingers. [465]
The collector approached, his shadow falling over her. [475]
“You’re not supposed to be here,” she said, her voice like wind through dry reeds. [493]
“I know,” he replied. [497]

She looked at him then, really looked, and he saw the moment she recognized what he was. [518]
Her eyes widened, but she did not flee. [528]
“You’re the one who collects the lost,” she said. [539]
“Not anymore,” he admitted. [544]
She studied him for a long moment, then patted the rock beside her. [559]
“Sit,” she said. [561]

He did. [563]
The harp’s music swelled around them, the notes clashing and harmonizing in ways that made his teeth ache. [585]
“Why are you still here?” he asked. [593]
She laughed, a sound so bright it cut through the gloom like a blade. [610]
“Because I forgot how to leave,” she said. [619]
“And now?” [622]

She smiled, and for the first time in centuries, the collector felt something warm unfurl in his chest. [645]
“Now,” she said, “I think I remember.” [654]
She reached into the air and plucked a note from the harp’s song, holding it between her fingers like a firefly. [678]
“Here,” she said, pressing it into his palm. [687]

It was laughter, pure and untainted. [694]
The collector closed his fingers around it, and for the first time in a long time, he did not feel like a ghost. [720]
The hidden sunrise broke over the gorge, painting the cliffs in gold and rose. [737]
The woman stood, her form flickering like a candle flame. [750]
“Thank you,” she said. [754]

He wanted to ask her name, but she was already gone, dissolved into the light. [771]
The harp’s music faded, leaving only the sound of the wind and the distant echo of laughter. [791]
The collector stood, the crocodile’s tooth warm in his pocket, and stepped forward into the dawn. [812]
