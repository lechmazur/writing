The salt flat stretched endlessly under a sky heavy with the promise of rain that never came. [13]
Elias Veyne stood at its edge, his polished boots sinking slightly into the crystalline crust, the only sound the distant, rumbling lull of thunder that never broke. [38]
He was an amoral philanthropist, a man who funded hospitals with one hand and smuggled rare artifacts with the other, his reputation as pristine as the salt beneath his feet. [73]
In his palm rested an extinct bird’s egg, its shell a mosaic of iridescent blues, a relic from a species that had vanished before he was born. [103]
He had bought it from a black-market dealer in Marrakech, not for its beauty, but for its echo—for the way it still hummed with the ghost of a song no living ear had ever heard. [141]

The drought was his doing. [146]
Not the natural kind, but the manufactured sort, a slow, deliberate unraveling of the land’s veins. [168]
He had paid engineers to divert rivers, to dam the underground aquifers, to turn fertile valleys into dust so that the salt flats would grow, inch by inch, year by year. [198]
It was a cruel joke, really—preserving the echo of extinct birds by erasing the world that had once sustained them. [227]
But Elias was secretly sentimental, though he would have laughed if anyone accused him of it. [246]
He kept a locked drawer in his study, filled with pressed flowers from places he’d never visit again, ticket stubs from concerts he’d attended alone, and a single, yellowed photograph of a girl with a gap-toothed smile—his sister, who had died when he was twelve. [299]

The map was drawn in the cracks of the dried riverbeds, a labyrinth of fissures that only made sense if you knew how to read them. [328]
Elias had spent months studying satellite images, tracing the paths of water that no longer flowed, until the pattern emerged like a secret language. [357]
Tonight, he followed it, his steps deliberate, his breath shallow. [369]
The egg in his hand was warm, as if the bird inside had only just stopped breathing. [389]
He had chosen this night—the lull of distant thunder—because the air was thick with static, with the weight of something about to break. [422]

At the center of the salt flat, where the cracks converged into a perfect, jagged circle, Elias knelt. [446]
He placed the egg into the shallow depression, its shell catching the faint, sickly light of the moon. [466]
For a moment, he hesitated. [471]
Then, with a sharp exhale, he released it. [480]
Not the egg—he would never let that go—but the drought. [494]
With a few taps on his phone, the dams he had built would open, the rivers would surge back into their beds, and the land would remember what it was to be wet. [534]
The salt would recede, inch by inch, year by year, until the flats were just a memory. [557]

He had done it for the echo. [564]
Not to bring the birds back—that was impossible—but to preserve the sound of them, the way their songs had once rippled through the air like water. [599]
The drought had been a vessel, a way to hold onto something that was already gone. [623]
Now, with the rivers returning, the echo would have a place to live again, in the rustle of reeds, in the croak of frogs, in the distant thunder that might, one day, finally break. [667]

Elias stood, brushing the salt from his knees. [678]
The egg remained where he had placed it, a tiny monument to what had been lost. [699]
He would leave it there, he decided. [710]
Let the rain come, let the salt dissolve, let the world forget him. [728]
But the echo would remain. [735]
And that was enough. [739]
