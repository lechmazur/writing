The mist curled around Elias Veyne’s ankles like a living thing, thick and cloying, as he stepped into the feral nexus where the river bent unnaturally against its own flow. [23]
His fingers trembled—not from the cold, but from the weight of the spiral seashell fragment tucked into his coat pocket, its edges worn smooth by time and something else, something that hummed when he pressed it to his ear. [65]
Elias was a conflicted novelist, a man who had spent years crafting stories that never quite satisfied him, as if the ink itself resisted his touch. [97]
Here, in this liminal space where the world seemed to fold in on itself, he had come to collect the shapes of different hopes, though he wasn’t entirely sure what that meant. [136]

The air smelled of damp earth and old paper, the scent of a library left to rot. [152]
He had read about this place in a half-remembered dream, a crossing where the boundaries between stories blurred, where characters slipped free of their pages like ghosts. [184]
Elias had always been lucidly watchful, his mind sharp even when his heart was uncertain, and now that vigilance served him as he scanned the mist for movement. [219]
A flicker—a woman in a tattered shawl, her face half-obscured, standing where the river should have been. [239]
She vanished before he could call out, leaving only the faintest ripple in the air, like a page turning. [260]

This was how it worked, he realized: through ephemeral cameo appearances, the hopes of others revealed themselves, fleeting and fragile. [287]
He had come to solemnize them, to give their shapes weight before they dissolved back into the mist. [311]
His own hope—if he still had one—was tangled in the spiral seashell fragment, its hollow chambers echoing with the sound of his unfinished novel, the one that had haunted him for years. [350]

The river’s current pushed against him, not with force, but with insistence, as if urging him to turn back. [377]
Elias had always been a man who moved against the current, though, and he waded deeper, his boots sinking into the silt. [403]
Another figure emerged—a boy with a kite string wrapped around his wrist, the kite itself lost to the mist. [428]
“Do you see it?” the boy asked, his voice thin as paper. [439]
Elias shook his head. [442]
The boy’s face fell, but only for a moment before he, too, faded, leaving Elias alone with the whisper of closing pages, the sense that time was running out. [479]

He clutched the seashell fragment tighter, its edges digging into his palm. [495]
This was the problem with hope, he thought: it was never just one thing. [512]
It was the boy’s kite, the woman’s shawl, the river’s resistance, the novel he couldn’t finish. [532]
It was the way the mist swirled in patterns that almost made sense, like sentences half-formed. [553]

A third figure appeared—a man in a long coat, his back to Elias, staring into the river as if searching for something beneath the surface. [586]
Elias knew him instantly, though he had never met him before. [599]
It was the protagonist of his unfinished novel, the one who had refused to take shape on the page. [622]
“You’re here,” Elias said, his voice barely above a whisper. [636]
The man turned, his eyes hollow, his expression unreadable. [650]
“You never let me be anything more than a sketch,” he said. [667]
Elias swallowed. [670]
“I didn’t know how,” he admitted. [676]

The man’s form began to dissolve, his edges blurring like ink in water. [695]
“Then learn,” he said, his voice fading. [703]
Elias reached out, but his fingers closed on nothing. [714]
The mist thickened, the river’s current pulling harder now, as if the nexus itself was trying to expel him. [740]

He thought of the seashell fragment, of the hopes he had come to collect. [757]
Maybe that was the point—not to hold onto them, but to let them pass through him, to give them shape before they vanished. [788]
With a deep breath, Elias turned against the current, wading back toward the shore, the whisper of closing pages growing louder behind him. [820]
The mist would always be there, he knew, and so would the hopes, fleeting and fragile and real. [844]
All he had to do was keep watching. [853]
