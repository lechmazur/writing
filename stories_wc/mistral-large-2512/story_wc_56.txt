The errant legend seeker stepped onto the twilight barge canal, his boots sinking slightly into the damp wood of the dock. [18]
The water lapped against the hulls of moored boats, their lanterns flickering like dying stars in the dim light. [39]
He had spent years chasing whispers of forgotten truths, but tonight, the air itself seemed to hum with the weight of something unspoken. [70]
In his coat pocket, the antique pocket sundial pressed against his thigh, its brass edges cold despite the mild evening. [93]
He had found it in a junk shop three towns back, its face etched with symbols that matched no known language—yet the needle always pointed north, no matter how he turned it. [127]

By the silence of morning radio, he had learned to listen for what wasn’t said. [143]
The static between stations carried more meaning than the voices that cut through it, and he had trained his instincts to parse the gaps. [169]
That was how he knew the barge ahead, its paint peeling like old skin, held more than just cargo. [190]
The legend seeker adjusted his grip on the sundial, its weight a comfort, a reminder that time was not as rigid as it seemed. [218]

He boarded the barge with the quiet precision of a man who had done this a hundred times before. [240]
The hold smelled of salt and something older—damp parchment, perhaps, or the ghost of ink long dried. [262]
His fingers traced the edges of crates stacked haphazardly, their contents hidden beneath layers of burlap and tar. [286]
Then he saw it: a single crate, its lid slightly ajar, revealing a corner of something metallic. [309]

Salvage was not theft, he told himself. [320]
It was preservation, the act of pulling fragments from the tide before they were lost forever. [342]
He pried the lid open, his breath catching at the sight of the object inside—a mirror, its surface clouded with age, framed in tarnished silver. [371]
But it wasn’t the mirror that held his attention; it was the reflection in it. [389]
The barge’s hold stretched endlessly, the crates multiplying into a labyrinth, and at its center stood a figure, familiar yet distorted, as if seen through warped glass. [426]

The legend seeker’s pulse quickened. [434]
Hindsight clarity was a cruel gift, revealing the shape of lies only after they had already shaped the world. [460]
He had spent his life chasing the architecture of those lies, the way they bent truth into something unrecognizable. [486]
But this—this was different. [493]
The figure in the mirror raised a hand, and the sundial in his pocket grew warm. [513]

He pulled it out, watching as the needle spun wildly before settling on a direction he had never seen it point before. [540]
Not north. [543]
Not any cardinal direction at all, but toward the mirror, toward the figure, toward the truth he had been seeking without realizing it. [574]
The legend seeker exhaled, his breath steady despite the weight of the moment. [595]
This was the serene upheaval he had been waiting for—the quiet collapse of everything he thought he knew. [622]

The figure in the mirror spoke, its voice a whisper carried on the wind. [640]
*"You’ve been looking in the wrong places."* [648]
The words settled over him like a shroud, thoughtfully clear, cutting through the noise of his doubts. [672]
He had spent years training his instincts to see what others missed, but he had never considered that the lies might be looking back at him. [703]

The barge creaked beneath him, the water outside still, as if the canal itself was holding its breath. [728]
The legend seeker reached into the crate and lifted the mirror, its weight heavier than it should have been. [752]
The figure smiled, and for the first time, he recognized himself. [770]
Not as he was, but as he might have been—had he not spent his life chasing shadows. [796]
The sundial’s needle stilled, pointing at the reflection, at the truth he had always carried with him. [822]
