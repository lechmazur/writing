The frozen library above the clouds was a place of driftwood nostalgia, where the air smelled of old parchment and the faintest hint of frost. [18]
Elias, the lunar-eclipse locksmith, had spent years wandering its halls, his fingers tracing the spines of books that had never known earth. [42]
He had come here under the soft hush of a distant morning, when the first light of dawn had painted the sky in hues of silver and blue. [73]
His motivation was simple: to learn the rhythm of repair, to understand how things broken could be made whole again. [99]

The library was a labyrinth of ice and glass, its shelves stretching endlessly into the mist. [118]
At its heart stood the hall of mirrors, a chamber where reflections twisted and bent, showing not just the present but fragments of what could be. [149]
Elias had avoided it for years, fearing what it might reveal. [164]
But today, he had no choice. [170]

A gear assortment from an old clockmaker lay scattered across his workbench, its pieces hauntingly bright in the dim light. [193]
Each gear was a puzzle, its teeth worn smooth by time, its purpose lost to the ages. [214]
Elias had found them in a forgotten corner of the library, buried beneath scraps of prophecy that spoke of a time when the world’s mechanisms would fail. [247]
The prophecies had been written in a language he barely understood, but the gears had called to him, their metallic whispers promising answers. [273]

He uncapped a vial of oil, its golden liquid shimmering like captured sunlight. [290]
The gears needed more than just oil, though—he knew that. [304]
They needed a rhythm, a pattern, something to guide their movement. [321]
The hall of mirrors might hold the key. [332]

Stepping inside, Elias was met with a thousand versions of himself, each one a different path he could have taken. [359]
Some reflections showed him as a child, others as an old man, and a few as something in between, something he didn’t recognize. [389]
The mirrors were not just glass; they were windows into possibilities, and the gears in his pocket hummed as if sensing their purpose. [423]

He knelt before one reflection, where a younger Elias stood in a workshop, surrounded by clocks that ticked in perfect unison. [453]
The gears in his hand fit together effortlessly, their movements synchronized like a dance. [474]
But this was not his past—it was a future that could still be. [490]

Through scraps of prophecy hidden in the library’s corner, he had learned that the gears were part of a greater machine, one that controlled the passage of time itself. [528]
The clockmaker who had forged them had vanished long ago, leaving behind only fragments of his work. [554]
Elias realized now that the hall of mirrors was not just a place of reflection—it was a place of creation. [583]

He began to arrange the gears on the floor, their hauntingly bright surfaces catching the light from the mirrors. [610]
Each placement was deliberate, each connection a step toward understanding. [627]
The prophecies had spoken of a rhythm, a pattern that could mend what was broken. [651]
Elias closed his eyes and listened. [661]

The gears began to turn. [666]
Not all at once, but slowly, as if waking from a long sleep. [686]
The mirrors around him flickered, their reflections shifting to show not just his past and future, but the past and future of the world itself. [725]
He saw the clockmaker’s workshop, the gears being forged in fire, the moment when the machine had first been set in motion. [755]
And then he saw the moment it had stopped. [770]

The clockmaker had not vanished—he had been trapped, his consciousness scattered across the gears like dust. [798]
Elias understood now why the library had called to him. [814]
He was not just a locksmith; he was a bridge between what had been and what could be. [839]
The rhythm of repair was not just about fixing things—it was about remembering. [860]
