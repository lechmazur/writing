The vanishing point gallery stretched like a wound in the city’s side, its walls lined with paintings that seemed to breathe. [16]
Elias moved through the dim light, his fingers brushing the frames as if checking for pulses. [32]
Tonight, the gallery was empty—no patrons, no guards, only the slow creak of an old rocking chair in the corner. [56]
It had been his mother’s once, the wood worn smooth by decades of restless motion. [73]
Now it swayed gently, as if someone had just risen from it, though no one was there. [94]

Elias knelt beside the chair, pressing his palm to the seat. [109]
The warmth lingered. [112]
He exhaled, watching his breath curl into the cold air. [124]
This was the place where he scattered her ashes—three years ago, on the night the gallery first opened. [146]
The charcoal portrait above the fireplace had been her last work, unfinished, its strokes smudged where her hand had trembled. [170]
He had promised to complete it, but the face in the portrait remained a ghost, half-formed. [190]

A sound like breaking glass made him turn. [200]
On the floor lay a mask, its surface a mosaic of shattered porcelain shards. [217]
It was beautiful in the way a knife is beautiful—sharp, deliberate, glinting with something like malice. [239]
Elias picked it up, the edges biting into his skin. [251]
The mask was warm, as if it had just been worn. [263]

He had seen it before, in a photograph tucked into his mother’s journal. [279]
A masquerade ball, decades past, where she had danced with a man whose face no one remembered. [302]
The journal entry read: *He weaves truth carefully, but the threads always fray.* [321]
Elias had never understood what it meant—until now. [333]

The rocking chair creaked again, slower this time. [344]
Elias set the mask down and stepped toward the portrait. [357]
The charcoal lines seemed to shift under his gaze, the smudges resolving into something like a smile. [378]
His mother had been trying to capture a fleeting emotion, one that slipped through words like water. [401]
He had spent years chasing it, powdering her old pigments, mixing them with her ashes to keep the color true. [429]

But the emotion remained just out of reach, a mirage of safety that dissolved the closer he came. [452]
The gallery itself was like that—beautiful, hollow, a place where people came to feel something only to leave emptier. [477]
The vanishing point in every painting pulled the eye into nothingness, a trick of perspective that left viewers disoriented. [504]

Elias turned the mask over in his hands. [513]
The porcelain shards were held together by something dark and sticky, like dried blood. [533]
He pressed it to his face. [540]
The world sharpened, then blurred. [546]

Through the eyeholes, he saw his mother sitting in the rocking chair, younger than he remembered. [567]
She was laughing, but her eyes were wet. [576]
The man from the photograph stood beside her, his face obscured by another mask—this one smooth, unbroken. [601]
*You can’t keep what isn’t yours,* the man said. [613]
His voice was familiar, though Elias couldn’t place it. [627]

The vision dissolved. [631]
Elias tore the mask away, gasping. [640]
The rocking chair had stopped. [646]
Dust motes hung in the air, suspended like the truth he had been chasing. [667]

He understood now. [671]
His mother hadn’t been trying to crystallize an emotion—she had been trying to outrun one. [694]
The mask, the journal, the portrait—all of it was incomplete information, fragments of a story she couldn’t finish. [723]
And the gallery, with its vanishing points and hollow promises, was the perfect place to hide. [746]

Elias scattered the last of her ashes onto the portrait. [760]
The charcoal smudged, then darkened, the face resolving at last. [776]
It was his own. [781]

The rocking chair creaked once more, as if settling. [793]
Elias picked up the mask and walked to the gallery’s exit. [807]
Outside, the city hummed, indifferent. [815]
He dropped the mask into a trash bin and didn’t look back. [830]
