The undertaker’s hands trembled as he unfolded the oilcloth wrapping, revealing the broken lighthouse lens. [15]
It was cold, heavier than it should have been, its jagged edges catching the dim light of his lantern like teeth. [35]
The package had arrived that morning, postmarked from a port town he hadn’t heard of in decades, the ink smudged as if by seawater. [60]
No note, no explanation—just the lens, its fractures refracting the lamplight into fractured rainbows across his workbench. [80]

He should have left it there. [86]
But the undertaker was inadvertently stubborn, the kind of man who, once set on a path, would walk it until his boots wore through or the road ended. [116]
And this road had no end in sight. [124]

The lens hummed faintly in his grip, a sound like a distant foghorn. [138]
He knew distress signals when he heard them. [146]
This one was older than the ships that had once plied these waters, older than the drowned city beneath the waves, older even than the library that had sunk with it. [172]
The thought settled in his chest like a stone. [181]

The forgotten underwater city library was a place he had visited only in dreams—or so he told himself. [202]
In truth, he had been there once, years ago, when the sea had receded just enough to reveal its spires through the mist. [225]
He had waded in, the water lapping at his knees, and found the doors still ajar, as if the city had been waiting for him. [250]
The books inside had been preserved by some unseen magic, their pages crisp despite the salt and time. [270]
He had taken one—a slim volume on funerary rites—and left the rest, knowing he would return. [288]

Now, the lens was pulling him back. [296]

He packed a satchel with dry clothes, a lantern, and the book he had stolen. [312]
The walk to the shore took longer than it should have, his legs heavy with the weight of what he was about to do. [336]
The tide was low, the sand slick with algae, and the city’s silhouette loomed ahead like a ghost. [356]
He waded in, the cold biting at his ankles, then his knees, then his waist. [372]
The water was clearer than he remembered, the library’s domed ceiling visible through the waves, its stained glass windows glowing faintly, as if lit from within. [402]

Occupying impossible spaces had always been his gift. [412]
The undertaker had spent his life fitting the dead into coffins too small, arranging flowers in vases too narrow, whispering prayers into ears that no longer heard. [445]
Now, he would do the same for the living—or what remained of them. [460]

The library’s doors groaned as he pushed them open, the water parting to let him through. [479]
Inside, the air was thick with the scent of old paper and salt, the shelves lined with books that had never known the touch of sunlight. [508]
He ran his fingers along their spines, feeling the pulse of the city beneath his fingertips. [527]

Then he saw it: a desk at the center of the room, its surface littered with broken lenses, each one humming like the first. [552]
A logbook lay open beside them, its pages filled with neat, looping script. [565]
He read the last entry aloud: *"The last keeper is gone. The light must not go out."* [583]

The undertaker understood. [587]
The city had been sending distress signals for centuries, its lighthouse dark, its people long turned to coral and memory. [614]
But the light was not just a beacon—it was a promise. [627]
A promise that rest would come, that the drowned would not be forgotten. [643]

He took the broken lens from his satchel and placed it on the desk. [657]
The moment it touched the others, the humming swelled into a chorus, the lenses glowing like embers. [677]
The water around him stilled, the city holding its breath. [690]

Revitalize. [692]
That was what the lens had wanted all along. [702]
Not to be fixed, but to be given purpose. [711]
The undertaker opened the book he had stolen and began to read, his voice steady, his hands no longer trembling. [735]
The words spilled into the water, weaving through the shelves, through the cracks in the lenses, through the bones of the city itself. [760]

The light returned. [764]
Not as a beacon, but as a glow, warm and golden, seeping into the forgotten places. [784]
The undertaker closed his eyes and let it wash over him. [796]
For the first time in years, he felt still. [804]
