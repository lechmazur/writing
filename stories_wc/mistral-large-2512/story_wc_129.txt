The crystalline orchard hummed with the weight of centuries, its glass-like branches swaying under a sky streaked with the remnants of forgotten constellations. [19]
Liora, the marsh-reed sculptor, traced her fingers along the jagged edge of a broken bough, her breath curling in the cold air like the whispers of lost languages. [47]
She had come here not for the fruit—though the orchard’s harvests were said to grant visions—but for the glimmering obsidian arbor at its heart, a structure woven from volcanic glass that pulsed with an eerie, living light. [92]
It was the only place where the webs of kinship, those invisible threads binding the scattered souls of this fractured world, seemed to thicken into something tangible. [126]

Liora had spent years carving reeds into figures of those she’d lost, each sculpture a hollow echo of a life she could no longer touch. [155]
But the arbor called to her, boldly sympathetic in its silence, as if it understood the ache of being both present and untethered. [181]
She had heard the stories: those who touched its surface saw glimpses of their kin, not as they were, but as they might have been if time had knit them closer. [217]
Tonight, she would dedicate her latest sculpture—a reed-woven child with eyes like polished river stones—to the arbor, in the hope that it might graft her onto the community she had always watched from the edges. [261]

The orchard’s edge overlooked a shimmering crater, its depths filled with a lake of liquid silver that reflected the fractured sky. [291]
Liora had come alone, but she was not the only seeker here. [304]
A group of travelers moved between the trees, their voices low as they discussed a shared search for an elusive street artist’s tag, a signature said to appear only in the presence of true kinship. [347]
The artist, known only as Veyra, left no murals or marks—only a single, perfect line of charcoal, like a stitch in the fabric of the world. [379]
To find it was to find belonging. [386]

Liora hesitated, then stepped forward. [392]
“You’re looking for Veyra’s tag?” she asked, her voice barely louder than the rustle of crystalline leaves. [416]
The travelers turned, their faces half-lit by the arbor’s glow. [429]
One, a woman with a scar across her palm, nodded. [439]
“We’ve been searching for years,” she said. [447]
“Some say the tag only appears when you’re ready to see it.” [461]

Liora’s fingers tightened around her sculpture. [469]
She had spent her life crafting others, never daring to claim a place among them. [488]
But the arbor’s light flickered, as if in invitation. [499]
“Then let’s look together,” she said. [508]

They spread out, eyes scanning the bark of trees, the undersides of leaves, the smooth stones at their feet. [532]
The orchard seemed to hold its breath. [540]
Then, just as Liora was about to give up, she saw it—a single, unbroken line of charcoal on the obsidian arbor, so fine it might have been a crack in the glass. [581]
But it wasn’t. [584]
It was Veyra’s mark, and it pulsed like a heartbeat. [598]

The travelers gasped. [601]
The woman with the scar pressed her palm to the line, and for a moment, the arbor blazed with light, revealing the silhouettes of others who had stood here before—kin, chosen and blood, woven into the same web. [652]
Liora’s breath caught. [657]
She lifted her sculpture and placed it against the glass. [670]
The reed child’s eyes gleamed, and the arbor’s light wrapped around it, pulling it into the pattern. [694]

When the glow faded, the sculpture was gone. [704]
In its place, a new line of charcoal appeared—this one shaped like Liora’s hand. [725]
The travelers turned to her, their faces alight with something like recognition. [743]
“You’re one of us now,” the scarred woman said. [755]

Liora exhaled, her chest tight with a luminescent ache. [767]
The orchard hummed around her, the webs of kinship no longer invisible. [782]
She had come seeking a graft, but what she found was a root. [798]
And for the first time, she let herself believe she belonged. [816]
