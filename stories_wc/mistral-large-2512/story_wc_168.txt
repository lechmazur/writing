The moon hung low over the ridge, its silver light spilling like liquid mercury across the path ahead. [16]
Elias adjusted the straps of his pack, the weight of his gear a familiar ache against his shoulders. [34]
The scars on his arms—ragged, pale things—itched under the cool night air, a reminder of the fire that had nearly taken him two summers ago. [69]
He wasn’t supposed to be here, not after the last burn, but the forest called to him in a way nothing else could. [95]

Ahead, the cracked porcelain box glinted in the moonlight, half-buried in the dirt where someone had dropped it. [119]
Elias crouched, brushing away the loose soil with his calloused fingers. [133]
The box was small, delicate, its surface webbed with fractures that caught the light like shattered dreams. [154]
He turned it over, and the lid fell open with a soft *click*. [167]
Inside, a single slip of paper lay folded into a tight square. [180]

His breath hitched as he unfolded it. [187]
The words were written in a child’s uneven scrawl: *"I traded my voice for the fire to stop. It worked, but now I can’t sing anymore."* [218]
Elias’s chest tightened. [223]
He knew that bargain—had seen it in the hollow eyes of the kids who’d watched their homes burn, who’d whispered wishes into the smoke and gotten silence in return. [260]

The ridge path wound upward, the trees thinning as the wind picked up, carrying the scent of pine and distant rain. [285]
Elias walked slowly, the box cradled in his palm like something sacred. [302]
He was gently skilled at this—reading the land, the people, the unspoken things that lingered in the aftermath of disaster. [328]
But this was different. [332]
This wasn’t about containment or strategy; it was about the quiet theft of something irreplaceable. [354]

A figure stepped onto the path ahead, silhouetted against the moon. [369]
Elias didn’t reach for his radio. [375]
The stranger moved with the same weary grace as the wind through the branches, their face half-hidden beneath a hood. [402]
"You found it," they said, voice rough as bark. [413]

Elias held up the box. [417]
"You’re the one who left this?" [424]
The stranger nodded. [427]
"I was twelve when I made the deal. [436]
The fire was eating the school, and I just… wanted it to stop." [453]
Elias had heard variations of this story before—kids bargaining with the dark, with the heat, with whatever they thought might listen. [482]
But this time, the weight of it settled differently. [494]

The celestial bodies above them shifted, slow and deliberate, as if the universe itself was holding its breath. [521]
Elias sat on a flat rock, motioning for the stranger to join him. [537]
"Tell me what you lost," he said. [545]
The stranger hesitated, then pulled back their hood. [556]
Their throat bore a thin, silver scar, like a seam where a voice had been stitched shut. [575]

Elias didn’t flinch. [578]
He’d seen worse in the mirror. [585]
Instead, he reached into his pack and pulled out a notebook, its pages filled with sketches of fire patterns, wind currents, and, in the margins, fragments of poetry. [620]
"I’ve been trying to translate pain into something others can understand," he said. [640]
"Not just the burns, but the things that don’t leave marks." [658]

The stranger watched as he flipped to a blank page and uncapped his pen. [674]
"Start with the first thing you remember," Elias said. [687]
"Not the fire. [691]
The thing that made you believe you could bargain with it." [710]

The stranger’s fingers trembled as they took the pen. [722]
The moon climbed higher, and the words began to flow, ink bleeding into the paper like water through cracked earth. [748]
Elias listened, not just to the story, but to the silence between the words—the part that had been stolen. [773]
And for the first time in years, he felt the hard edges of his own grief soften, just a little. [798]
The night air carried the sound of distant thunder, but neither of them moved. [814]
They were too busy rewriting the bargain. [823]
