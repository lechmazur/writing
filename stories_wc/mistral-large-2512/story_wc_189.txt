The grotto yawned open beneath a sky prickled with stars, its damp walls glistening like the skin of a sleeping beast. [18]
Liora crouched at the edge of the tidal pool, her fingers tracing the water’s surface, leaving ripples that dissolved into the dark. [43]
She was the tidal-pool chronicler, a title that sounded grander than it was—no one else cared to record the slow, patient lives of barnacles and anemones. [78]
But Liora did. [81]
She had always been warmly observant, the kind of person who noticed the way a hermit crab hesitated before choosing a new shell, or how the tide’s retreat left behind a lacework of salt crystals. [122]
Tonight, though, her attention was fixed on something else: the jade cicada clutched in her palm. [144]
It was no ordinary insect. [150]
The carving was flawless, its wings etched with veins so fine they seemed to pulse in the dim light, its body cool and heavy with age. [178]
She had found it weeks ago, half-buried in the silt of the pool’s deepest corner, as if it had been waiting for her. [207]
Liora didn’t believe in omens, but she believed in patterns, and the cicada’s sudden appearance felt like one. [230]

The grotto was a place of transition periods—between tides, between breaths, between the things people said and the things they meant. [258]
She had come here to escape the conversation above, the one where her brother had asked, with forced casualness, if she planned to leave the village. [290]
The pause between his question and her answer had stretched like a taut thread, and she had slipped away before it could snap. [321]
Now, she sat in the quiet, trying to discover the texture of time. [338]
Not its passage—she knew that well enough—but its weight, its grain, the way it could feel like honey or like sand depending on the moment. [368]

The cicada was key. [372]
She had spent days studying it, running her thumb over its back, watching how the light caught its edges. [398]
Then, last night, she had dreamed of it. [407]
Not a dream, exactly—more like a memory that wasn’t hers. [423]
She had seen the grotto as it was centuries ago, the pool smaller, the air thick with the scent of burning resin. [453]
A woman in a robe of indigo had knelt where Liora now sat, pressing the cicada into the silt and whispering words Liora couldn’t hear. [488]
When she woke, the cicada was warm in her hand, as if it had just been held. [512]

She didn’t understand it, but she didn’t need to—not yet. [527]
Liora had always approached mysteries through tangential paths, circling them like a crab sidling toward a shadow. [554]
If she couldn’t grasp the cicada’s purpose directly, she would observe its effects. [576]
So she placed it back into the pool, watching as the water lapped at its edges. [597]
The ripples spread, distorting the reflection of the stars above. [615]
Then, slowly, the cicada began to sink. [625]
Not into the silt, but through it, as if the pool were a veil and the cicada was passing beyond. [653]

Liora gasped. [656]
The water stilled, and for a heartbeat, she thought she saw something—a flicker of movement beneath the surface, a shape that wasn’t rock or fish or weed. [696]
A face, perhaps, or the suggestion of one. [711]
Then it was gone. [715]
The cicada, too, had vanished. [722]

She sat back on her heels, her pulse thrumming in her throat. [738]
The grotto felt different now, charged with something older than the tides. [761]
Above, the conversation with her brother was still waiting, the pause still hanging between them. [785]
But Liora understood, suddenly, that the cicada hadn’t been a message for her. [805]
It had been a key. [810]
And the door it opened wasn’t in the grotto, but in the silence she had left behind. [834]
She stood, brushing the sand from her knees, and climbed back toward the surface. [855]
The stars were still watching. [861]
So was time. [864]
