<story>Only between the drop and the ripple could I detach from weight and remember my name. [16]
That hourglass sliver was where a gravity defier earns faith the way others earn bruises. [31]
I met it on the glowing viaduct after rain, when puddles were altars reflecting low, darkening brightness. [48]
The city washed its static from my ears, and the air smelled like cooled wires and wet stone. [66]
I had come to retrace what I kept losing, the path toward the labyrinth of self I feared and needed. [86]
The clay pressed into my palm was older than any map, an ancient clay tablet with runes like sleeping cicadas. [106]
When I tilted it, water chased the grooves and made a script of rainlight I could almost pronounce. [124]
Almost mattered, because the tablet did not speak in words but in procedures, seeded by what the sky remembered. [143]
I had learned to think like that: to generate the path forward through procedural generation, using inputs I did not own. [164]
Every step unfurled from a seed the rain buried in the tablet, branching possibilities like ferns opening under caustic starlight. [184]
Fractured timelines fanned beneath my feet, slippery mosaics that tilted whenever I breathed too hard. [199]
I knew which one held me, because my shadow refused it, hovering where the others accepted my weight. [217]
That was the curse and the craft of being periodically eternal, a loop that ends on the hour and starts on the echo. [240]
I did not live forever, but I lived again and again in the same suspended instant, learning its edges like a blind cartographer. [263]
To conquer the labyrinth of self, I had to chart that instant without breaking it, to listen without leaning. [282]
So I stepped onto the viaduct's spine, slick with neon guttering, and let my muscles forget their covenant with the ground. [303]
I rose a finger's width, no more, a hovering no grander than breath finding a snag in a stranger's throat. [323]
The tablet warmed, runes like coals under ash, and the puddles on the viaduct began to rearrange themselves. [341]
A pathway of reflections stitched across the arches, prescribing a sequence the way a melody prescribes breath to a choir. [361]
Follow this, my bones said, and retrace what the flood took. [372]
I glided along the lit puddles, toes refusing the slick, shoulders aligned with the rain's remembered vectors. [389]
Each step tuned the timelines, some darkening brightness collapsing into others, some flaring like warnings from futures I had already survived. [410]
One branch showed me falling, not with terror but with poetry, a descent that measured how much I had tried to rise. [432]
Another showed a room I refused to enter, its door numbered with the digits of my first breath and last word. [453]
Between them ran the viaduct, new as a wound, old as a bridge the river dreams when the city sleeps. [473]
I kept to the generated pattern, trusting that the rain knew more about me than I was ready to confess. [493]
It led me to the middle arch, where the city fell away on both sides like two arguments finally out of words. [515]
There the tablet's runes aligned, and I recognized my own handwriting, the hesitant gestures I had carved across incarnations. [534]
The message was spare: do not outrun what follows you, because it is only as fast as your refusal. [553]
I had always thought conquest meant height, but the labyrinth of self sits flat on the ground, a floor disguised as air. [575]
So I lowered, a grain at a time, trusting the instant between the drop and the ripple to hold without shattering. [596]
When my toes kissed stone, the timelines stopped sliding, and my shadow returned, not as a traitor but as a witness. [617]
The viaduct hummed like a throat clearing, and the puddles released their choreographies back to chance. [633]
I pressed the tablet to the wet rail and let the rain sand it smooth, erasing the seed I had already harvested. [655]
A gravity defier should know when to surrender gravity, otherwise every flight repeats the same mistake with better lighting. [674]
I walked the rest, counting arches, counting breaths, counting the staggered applause of distant tires, and every count felt like subtraction. [695]
But subtraction made room for something else, a corridor inside me that no longer insisted on ladders or wings. [714]
The darkness brightened without glare, the darkening brightness that taught me to read by absence, to stand by letting go. [734]
The instant loosened, and time resumed like a song switching from minor to the key that fits the throat you use today. [756]
I left the viaduct with rain on my tongue and no urgency to fly, only the patience to begin where I had avoided ending. [780]</story>
