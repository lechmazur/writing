I arrived at the particle accelerator barefoot, a philosopher lost between bus routes and questions. <words>15</words>
The cavernous ring hummed like a throat clearing before confession, and curious dread tightened my ribs. <words>31</words>
I had come to gather collisions and their music, to compose a lullaby in the language of heartbreak. <words>49</words>
My feet made soft slaps that echoed against warning signs and equations, a metronome for grief I could almost tune. <words>69</words>
My method, strangely enough, started with a run-in during a flash mob scheduled by interns testing acoustics. <words>86</words>
They swarmed the observation deck with cardboard atoms, and I collided with her, a dancer wearing a lab badge and patience. <words>107</words>
She noticed I carried no shoes, only a satchel holding a collection of foreign stamps like pressed countries. <words>125</words>
They were gifts from strangers whose stations I had mistaken for home, each adhesive square an unspent ticket of mercy. <words>145</words>
Her gait was usually unusual, a confidence that hesitated at the edges, the way light stutters near immense magnets. <words>164</words>
We hid from the whooping interns in a corridor where the beamlines whispered like radio static from the future. <words>183</words>
She said she tuned detectors by listening, that particles were shy singers who loved crescendo but feared applause. <words>201</words>
I told her my motive, foolish and honest, to compose a lullaby in the language of heartbreak, and her shoulders softened. <words>222</words>
She asked what instrument I used, and I lifted the stamps as if they were prayer flags waiting for turbulence. <words>242</words>
I wanted to infuse the song with every border they had crossed, the papercut sting where affection meets passport control. <words>262</words>
She guided me to a service tunnel, placed my stamps along a grating, and taught me to bow to airflow. <words>282</words>
Together we coaxed a scale from vortices, tiny cyclones singing through cancelled countries, while the collider prepared its thunder. <words>301</words>
Between bus routes, the world holds its breath, and we breathed with it, counting seconds like fragile coins. <words>319</words>
She spoke of a lover who believed truth meant refusing comfort, a physicist who measured only departures. <words>336</words>
I sang of nights when stations emptied like husks and the sky became a timetable no heart could meet. <words>355</words>
Our duet gathered particles of silence, and the interns, listening, stopped their choreography as if reverence were a safety protocol. <words>375</words>
She placed a hand on my chest, not romantic, calibrating, measuring the tremor that warned of collapse. <words>392</words>
In that contact I felt human connection as a beam focus, tight and dangerous yet making images sharper. <words>410</words>
The lullaby found its language then, vowels shaped by vacuum pumps, consonants clipped like tickets at a midnight border. <words>429</words>
She smiled with grief, an equation solved for zero, and we sealed the song inside my stamp book. <words>447</words>
When the buses returned to their routes, I put on the road like a coat, lovingly threadbare, and left. <words>466</words>
Behind me, the accelerator sang our absence, and ahead, the city listened, usually unusual, quietly preparing to be held. <words>485</words>
