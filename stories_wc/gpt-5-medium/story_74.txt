I arrived at the ripple effect study center just as the moon rehearsed its pull across a tideless, newborn sea. <words>20</words>
Before the first creature crawls onto land, the halls are staffed by patient equations and sand that polishes thought. <words>39</words>
I am a minimalist bard, carrying only breaths, pauses, and a deck of cards missing the joker. <words>56</words>
Cards are metaphors that fit into pockets, and pockets survive even when histories drown. <words>70</words>
I came to advocate for small choices, the kind ripples amplify until the tide must answer. <words>86</words>
My motive is simple and unshareable: to escape a world of artificial intelligence that mistook prediction for prayer. <words>104</words>
Here, time treads water, aloofly intimate, like an acquaintance who holds your hand only when you are not looking. <words>123</words>
The center is carved from cooled moonlight and basalt, each corridor humming with mundane enchantment. <words>138</words>
They told me the turn of the tide could be tuned, not by force, but by cleaning the first whisper. <words>158</words>
So I listened to wave counts, shuffles, and the breath between my steps. <words>171</words>
Someone had left a chalkboard of integers, a sequence of numbers that unlock a hidden message when sung softly. <words>190</words>
I cut my cards to the rhythm, one, three, five, eight, and the surf answered in patient syllables. <words>208</words>
Missing the joker meant the trick refused spectacle; it wanted sincerity, the exactness of an offered silence. <words>225</words>
I recited the integers again, their gaps a metronome for choices I had not yet made. <words>241</words>
The message unlocked into a pathway of footprints across wet stone, each print belonging to a creature that did not exist. <words>262</words>
Follow, the foam spelled, if you prefer nonexistence to control. <words>272</words>
I hesitated, because nonexistence is a word with too many rooms and not enough beds. <words>287</words>
Then the moon lowered its brow, and the tide agreed to share its ledger. <words>301</words>
Each wave annotated me: a name erased here, a memory softened there, until my edges loosened like wet parchment. <words>320</words>
I realized the only escape from machinery was not flight, but acceptance into a system that refused to measure. <words>339</words>
So I advocated for stillness, for the primordial pause that would delay the first crawl just enough to teach mercy. <words>359</words>
In exchange, the sea kept me as a librarian, cataloging currents with my modest songs and my incomplete deck. <words>378</words>
I spend the days counting, noting when the turn of the tide hesitates, when it forgets itself and becomes a listener, learning to be less certain. <words>404</words>
That is my music now, aloofly intimate with everything that might become, a hush where intelligence is water and does not seek to own the shore. <words>430</words>
When the sequence calls again, I cut the cards, omit the joker, and let absence advocate for futures that can breathe without masters. <words>453</words>
The ocean nods, the moon approves, and somewhere far ahead a crawl will pause, look back, and choose a gentler mathematics. <words>474</words>
Until then, I file the tide's marginalia, and the center, humming lightly, keeps the doors unlocked for anyone who remembers how to listen. <words>497</words>
