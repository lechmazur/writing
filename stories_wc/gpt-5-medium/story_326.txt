I run the only theme park in the underground city of the fairies, and it is failing. <words>17</words>
They call me an illusionist, but business calls me late, and creditors call me by noon. <words>33</words>
Still, my art breathes with passionate subtlety, because disbelief is the last currency accepted at the gate. <words>50</words>
Every night I unfold a battered folding fan, painted with embers that remember, and the hush begins. <words>67</words>
Down here, the memory of fire is both prayer and threat, a relic of stories that burned holes in darkness. <words>87</words>
The fairies lack the spark to survive the surface sun, a genetic limitation etched like frost across their wings. <words>106</words>
They hire me to mediate between guilds that hoard dwindling glow, via garbled walkie-talkie transmissions straining through mineral ribs. <words>125</words>
My job is to keep them talking long enough for wonder to stabilize the neighborhood, and for lights to stay on. <words>146</words>
But under every sentence I hear the soft roar of what they fear most, the evolutionary silence after flames. <words>165</words>
Once, a surface carnival taught me that heat is a language, and mine could translate longings into smoke. <words>183</words>
I built this park to defy genetic limitations, to trick the body into believing the soul had rehearsed sunlight. <words>202</words>
The rides mimic dawn, the tunnels murmur birds, and the mirrors paint wings that grow sweetly fierce when children smile. <words>222</words>
Yet fewer come, and the accounts shed feathers no ledger can regrow. <words>234</words>
So I stage a final illusion across the hush of cosmic possibility, inviting the city to gamble on becoming. <words>253</words>
I open the folding fan and spill a choreography of cool shadows, teaching their bodies to crave warmth without pain. <words>273</words>
Through the walkie-talkie, guild mothers argue about fuel, their words cutting out as if sentences were moths. <words>290</words>
I mediate quietly, promising to braid their fonts of glow into rotating nights, a coalition of soft revolutions. <words>308</words>
Then I step into the center ring and recall for them the first warmth I ever learned to counterfeit. <words>327</words>
It was not flame, but the memory of fire, sweetly fierce and patient, a rehearsal more honest than outcome. <words>346</words>
The park's ceiling blooms with auroras I conjure from tin foil and mineral dust, each ripple a hush teaching breath. <words>366</words>
Children raise their faces, and their parents raise their doubts, and still the light keeps trying new names for safety. <words>386</words>
When the generators falter, I whisper into the garbled transmissions, guide the guilds to open valves in sequence, and glow returns. <words>407</words>
The city exhales, and in that breath I feel a future aching through me, not inherited, but forged. <words>425</words>
If faith is a temperature, tonight we are learning to hold it, palms open, so it does not scorch or flee. <words>446</words>
I bow, the fan closes like a soft gate, and the fairies leave warmer than their wings believed possible. <words>465</words>
Above us, the future burns elsewhere, but below, we keep its memory intact enough to change our veins. <words>483</words>
In my failing park, I become permission, not flame, but the courage to imagine heat. <words>498</words>
