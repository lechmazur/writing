Inside the giant beehive interior, the confident watchman patrolled hexagonal corridors that dripped with sunlit honey and old classroom chalk. <words>20</words>
He carried a jubilant remorse, smiling at saved swarms while wincing at memories of a botched swarm-call that once bruised the queen's trust. <words>43</words>
Throughout coloring sessions, artisans dipped brushes into pollen pigments, and he measured boundaries on comb maps with a cracked plastic ruler that flexed like a molting wing. <words>70</words>
From the waxed chambers rose the echo of yearning, a tremor in the hum that made even steady drones quiver toward distant orchards. <words>93</words>
He wanted to hush the voice of envy that skittered between combs, comparing nectar tallies and coloring grades with a bitterness that spread like mites. <words>118</words>
So he studied evidence through the patterns in a fingerprint under a microscope, a sticky whorl pressed on a palette of crushed asters. <words>141</words>
The loops mirrored flight paths; their radial scars mapped jealous shortcuts that siphoned color from novices during the soft-bell practice hour. <words>162</words>
He had been the one to invent soft-bell practice, forbidding harsh alarms and insisting on a forcibly gentle cadence that taught calm without dulling courage. <words>187</words>
Now the soft bell chimed, and he decided to mobilize not with sirens, but with crayons, rules, and storyboards sketched on cooled wax. <words>210</words>
He assigned each trembling novice a hue and a corridor, showing them with the cracked plastic ruler how colors could braid without erasing one another. <words>235</words>
Throughout coloring sessions he paced, his voice low, his hands calmly hovering over stingers and brushes, a shepherd whose crook happened to measure precisely. <words>259</words>
The echo of yearning softened into a chorus of curiosity as bees and children alike shaded their cells, each portrait a vow to share the light. <words>285</words>
All the while, he kept the fingerprint slide nearby, a relic reminding him he had almost followed those jealous shortcuts himself long ago. <words>308</words>
Because ambition had once sung inside him like a rival queen, he wore his jubilant remorse not as punishment but as confetti melted into wax. <words>333</words>
He whispered apologies to the queen he had frightened years before, and the hive accepted the words the way honey accepts rain: slowly, completely. <words>357</words>
When the final bell tolled, the corridors were braided with colors, envy hushed, yearning echoed only as a reminder of direction, not a command. <words>381</words>
He laid the cracked plastic ruler across the microscope, aligning scar to scar, and felt the hive's heartbeat tap through the bench like a teacher's knuckles, rhythmically, forgivingly. <words>409</words>
The confident watchman turned off the lights, daring the dark to test his forcibly gentle laws, and in that hush he knew his work would keep singing. <words>436</words>
