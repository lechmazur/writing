Orbital debris drifts like slow confetti outside the viewport while I sort salvaged screws and plastic fins for a toy. <words>20</words>
Amid toy assembly, my hands remember steadiness that my voice refuses, because I am an exorcist with stage fright. <words>39</words>
My ceremonies were never usual, and tonight the haunted cargo hums in a defiant hush that suits me. <words>57</words>
Grandmother left me pressed wildflowers in a brittle album, their colors stubborn as starlight trapped in frost. <words>74</words>
They smell of dust and fields we never walked, the inheritance of lies that shaped our names into masks. <words>93</words>
She said the blossoms protected travelers; she never said from whom, or why the pages rattled like armor. <words>111</words>
I pry open the album and submerge two petals in clear resin, sealing them into the toy's hollow wing. <words>130</words>
Inside the cargo, a whisper gathers, a child's breath caught inside rusting conduits and thermal blankets. <words>146</words>
I time my courage by the sound of a key turning in a lock, though no locks remain here. <words>165</words>
The key is memory, the lock is air, and the trick is pretending an audience applauds only silence. <words>183</words>
I speak to the whisper, throat tight, telling it that lies are heavy and gravity is optional out here. <words>202</words>
It answers with knocking, like little fists on a hatch, like cousins begging before the adults rehearse another story. <words>221</words>
All our legends began with departures, and ended with everyone swearing nothing had changed, because change would mean blame. <words>240</words>
I thread a copper wire through the toy, a makeshift antenna, and ask the ghost whose voice it borrowed. <words>259</words>
It says, Grandmother, and a field, and the album's missing page, the one glued inside a locket I carry. <words>278</words>
I open the locket and find her pressed wildflowers stitched with microscopic ink, a map of the wreck's beggars. <words>297</words>
She lied to keep smuggling children from confiscated worlds, and broke us with silence so the saved could breathe. <words>316</words>
The inheritance of lies was never greed, only a hidden corridor inside a story that dared not speak. <words>334</words>
I tell the whisper it may stop knocking, because I will finish the toy and carry it to their names. <words>354</words>
The resin hardens, the petals shine like tiny shields, and the wing finally balances the center of lift. <words>372</words>
I guide the toy down the corridor, currents soft as breath, and the ghost follows, quieting into purpose. <words>390</words>
We float past shards of solar panels and names etched in soot, a procession beneath the theater of vacuum. <words>409</words>
No applause, only a defiant hush as I promise to speak aloud what she could not risk writing. <words>427</words>
I am afraid, as always, but I want to sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never' and call it home. <words>447</words>
When I let the toy spin into the air, its wing whistles like a key, and the knocking stops. <words>466</words>
The cargo falls quiet, the children answer through antennas, and somewhere a door unlocks without locks, finally opening us. <words>485</words>
