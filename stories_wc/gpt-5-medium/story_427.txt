Wind barreled through the abandoned lighthouse as I, a dueling philosopher with a mechanical arm, practiced footwork across salt-scabbed stone. <words>20</words>
My opponent had not arrived, but his arguments hung in the salt air like rigging awaiting a storm. <words>38</words>
I had come to deconstruct them, and also myself, because to become a weaver of dreams demands dismantling the loom that knots you. <words>61</words>
On the lantern room table lay a single sock, gray as yesterday's gulls, a relic of some prior watch that never ended. <words>83</words>
I kept it as a token, tangibly abstract, the way a proof keeps one stubborn symbol to remind you what remains unknown. <words>105</words>
At the hush of unexpected applause from the surf, I realized the sea was the audience, and the cliff the amphitheater. <words>126</words>
The lighthouse had long stopped turning, yet its prisms still held shifting equilibria of light, tilting arguments across the walls like dueling shadows. <words>149</words>
When Marlow finally climbed the iron stair, he brought no blade, only a ledger swollen by damp and decisions. <words>168</words>
We duel by axioms now, he said, and the gears in my arm answered with a soft rehearsal of possible outcomes. <words>189</words>
His gaze kept returning to the sock, as if the lighthouse itself had shed a skin and was asking who would wear it. <words>212</words>
He offered me a bargain written in columns of debt and mercy, a secret revealed under duress by the storm that ruined the archive. <words>236</words>
Years ago, he admitted, he had falsified a lighthouse report to save a foundering smuggler, who later funded the university that named me promising. <words>260</words>
Now that same patron wanted proof I would remain tractable, a philosopher who could weave dreams only to sell them as obedient sleep. <words>283</words>
The ledger asked me to endorse his lie, to stabilize the past, to fix the light that should have kept shifting until morning. <words>306</words>
Coded desperation threaded my voice as I countered: equilibrium is not peace but a truce of pressures, and truth is the pressure we owe the drowned. <words>332</words>
My mechanical arm hummed, a metronome of ethics, and I deconstructed his proposition aloud, piece by piece, until only the admissions remained. <words>354</words>
Marlow's face learned the weather, then he clapped once, and the sea answered, and the prisms went still at the hush of unexpected applause. <words>378</words>
It was approval and warning, tangibly abstract, telling me the duel had ended only in the beginning of the vocation I had chosen. <words>401</words>
I took the sock, slipped it over the shining knuckles of my machine, and swore to weave dreams without owners, lighthouse-bright and seaworthy. <words>424</words>
Marlow folded the ledger shut like a wing he could not grow, and together we watched the water draft the first syllabus of morning. <words>448</words>
