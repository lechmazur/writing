<story>I was a former child star with an audience trained to applaud even when I forgot what applause was for. <words>20</words>
I rented the university vibration analysis chamber after hours, because quiet rooms confess truth when microphones lean in. <words>38</words>
On the steel table lay a crumpled treasure map, studio ink smeared by tears I denied belonged to me. <words>57</words>
I had come to tap into the wild magic of madness, which fame promised, then hid behind craft services and polite interviews. <words>79</words>
The plan felt authentically odd, like praying to a vending machine while angels argue about snacks and calibration. <words>97</words>
I would hear my future through the hidden layers of etched glass in a cathedral window, rigged as a spectral filter. <words>118</words>
The window was not stone set; it was a panel sliced from a demolished chapel, bolted upright between accelerometers. <words>137</words>
Pink neon from the hallway began to trickle across the glass, dribbling into saints who blinked like exhausted paparazzi. <words>156</words>
This was after the last secret is revealed, when a life stops hiding and becomes an exhibit with cracked plexiglass. <words>176</words>
I needed a ledger, a witness, a price tag, something to tally the price of ambition against the coins of quiet. <words>197</words>
So I taped contact mics to my ribs, pressed my palm to the glass saints, and read the tremors like braille. <words>218</words>
A voice rose through the panel, not pious but punk, saying my name in staccato, syncing to the chirp of the sensors. <words>240</words>
It smelled of hot lights and bubblegum hair spray, the exact zoo of my sitcom childhood where laughter tracks wagged their tails. <words>262</words>
The crumpled treasure map showed the city as a nervous system, and an X over this room, as if nerves could heal screaming. <words>285</words>
The map promised a shortcut back to wonder, but the legend warned payment required applause measured in nights spent unshared and eyes unwatered. <words>308</words>
I laughed with irreverent awe, because that sounded fair, and because my life had already been sold at a discount to charisma. <words>330</words>
I sang the jingle that made me famous, let it rattle the chamber, and tried to tap into the wild magic of madness. <words>353</words>
The window answered by refracting me into a thousand possible ages, each dripping upward through the hidden layers toward a halo shaped like rent. <words>377</words>
One version held Oscars like hot coals, another taught puppets the blues, but all hummed the same bill: the price of ambition is loneliness. <words>401</words>
I folded the map into a paper heart, let the neon trickle fill it, and chose an authentically odd road where applause sleeps. <words>424</words></story>
