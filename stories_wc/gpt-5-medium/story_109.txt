I am a cold-natured knight assigned to the secret agent center. <words>11</words>
They keep the lights low as if heat itself were classified, which suits my chill. <words>26</words>
My orders are lawfully rebellious, to infiltrate rule by honoring it publicly and bending it just enough in private. <words>45</words>
Tonight the mission is mine alone, set at the hush of a deserted intersection late at night. <words>62</words>
Why meet there, you ask, so close I can hear the question in my bones. <words>77</words>
Because folk remedies travel the quiet roads like contraband, and I have been sent to collect folk remedies. <words>95</words>
Our analysts believe cures move faster than news, and the oldest cures run along grief. <words>110</words>
That is why my method is to listen via incomplete family altars, the makeshift shelves where candles, photos, and stray offerings speak louder than sirens. <words>135</words>
On the curb tonight, a child's lost mitten curls like a sleeping ear beside a jar of salt, a note, and three withered sprigs of mint. <words>161</words>
I kneel, the asphalt communicating cold into my marrow as if to keep me honest. <words>176</words>
A woman watches from the shadows, and I tell her I am here to support what the city keeps overlooking. <words>196</words>
I do not flash a badge; my oath is colder and older than paperwork. <words>210</words>
She says the altar is for a brother who vanished between jobs and judgments, and she asks what I can possibly offer. <words>232</words>
I answer with stories I have gathered, recipes traded in whispers, poultices made from kitchen bravery and moonlight patience. <words>251</words>
But I also ask her to lend me the mitten, because the wool clenches a clue the files cannot hold. <words>271</words>
She hesitates, then nods, because rebellion can be lawful when it protects the helpless. <words>285</words>
In the knit scent I smell woodsmoke, nettle tea, and ink, and my chest stirs with an artistic awakening I never permitted myself. <words>308</words>
Pattern is policy, I realize, and beauty is a map for bringing lost bodies home. <words>323</words>
So I begin composing an archive that breathes, drawing the city through its altars, stitching remedies to addresses and addresses to names. <words>345</words>
The pattern leads me back inside the center, where my case officer shivers at my notebook as if the pages might melt protocols. <words>368</words>
I tell her we can keep every promise and still move the boundary, because lawfully rebellious is not a slogan but a craft. <words>391</words>
She blesses the work, and the agency prints small grants on paper that looks like prayers. <words>407</words>
We return to the streets, now with official support, placing blank pages beside incomplete family altars and inviting the neighborhood to finish the files. <words>431</words>
At the next intersection, the hush folds around us, and a girl runs up waving the other mitten like a flag of truce. <words>454</words>
She teaches me a salve of lard and pine and faith, and I teach her how to draw a brother strong enough to return. <words>478</words>
Even my cold blood warms as the city revises itself, one altar, one mitten, one remedy, one name at a time. <words>499</words>
