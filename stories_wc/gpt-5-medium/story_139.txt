In the heartbeat after a dream returns, the aerial gondola groans over serrated mountains, and I, a stubborn monk, open my satchel with cautious enchantment. <words>25</words>
I have come to outsmart my own dark reflection, which rides the glass with me and blurs itself into the clouds like an omen that thinks. <words>51</words>
The reflection once tricked my teachers and burned our archives, and I vowed to avenge the loss by harvesting the past with methods no shadow could mimic. <words>78</words>
From the satchel I lift a creased shipping label, visually unappealing, scabbed with old adhesive, its barcode flaking like snow from an abandoned shrine. <words>102</words>
It once wrapped an antique flute sent to our monastery by a collector who vanished, leaving only this label and a rumor of teeth. <words>126</words>
I carried the flute into exile, and when the dream returned last night, I heard clear as bells the instruction that had hidden in the woodgrain. <words>152</words>
Read the teeth; read the time; read the hunger that broke the mouthpiece; then you will find the arsonist wearing your face. <words>174</words>
Now, as the gondola shivers, I angle the flute to the light and begin my study, an archaeology conducted through analyzing tooth marks on an antique flute. <words>201</words>
Each notch is a date, each crescent a season of famine, each shallow groove a failed prayer, and the deepest incisions match my own bite from childhood. <words>228</words>
I swallow and continue, tracing the chatter of teeth that belonged to a line of hermits who believed the flute stored breath the way lakes store mountains. <words>255</words>
To harvest the past, you must first honor its bite marks, so I copy them onto the creased label, mapping a geography of hunger and devotion. <words>281</words>
The label becomes my talisman, still visually unappealing, but now humming with years, and my reflection across the window begins to twitch as if thawing. <words>306</words>
It grins with my teeth yet not my patience, and I realize the arsonist counted on my pride, not on my willingness to listen to splinters. <words>332</words>
I answer with a ritual of quiet chewing, gently setting my bite to each old groove, translating breath into names, and names into stations along this cableway. <words>359</words>
The pattern reveals where the reflection will leap next, a red maintenance tower above a ravine, and I ring the bell rope to halt between storms. <words>385</words>
The gondola slows, mountains breathing like sleeping oxen, and in the thrum I feel the dream become a map that points me to the tower and the mirror. <words>413</words>
I tape the creased label to the window, covering the reflection's mouth, and the mapped bites lock onto it like a cage for breath that is not mine. <words>441</words>
When the doors part at the tower, I step into the cold and lift the flute, and with one careful note I harvest the past and avenge the archives. <words>470</words>
