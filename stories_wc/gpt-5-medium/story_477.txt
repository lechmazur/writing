<story>The garden of the forgotten underwater city swayed like a slow cathedral, coral trellises breathing, seagrass whispering along tiled avenues. <words>20</words>
Rusted bells chimed in the currents, and I moved through them, a graceful swordsman seeking quiet among ruins. <words>38</words>
Above the sea, the world had polished everyone into identical reflections, and I had fled to keep a face. <words>57</words>
Here, amid bird songs piped through corrosion-gnawed speakers, individuality could echo imperfectly, which felt honest, even necessary. <words>74</words>
My mind was mindfully scattered, a reef of glints and eddies, yet each fragment knew the current that tethered it. <words>94</words>
I had come to innovate, not with patents or factories, but with listening, because silence here was louder than orders. <words>114</words>
I built a squat observatory from pearled bones of streetlights and a scavenged astronomy telescope sealed in wax and hope. <words>134</words>
Light rained strangely underwater, so I tuned for other weather, by scavenging for cosmic signals in broken TVs. <words>152</words>
Each barnacled screen sputtered star-stutter, a hush translated into pixel algae, and I fenced with it like a lesson. <words>171</words>
Sword practice here was dance and decoding, blade describing parabolas that matched orbital debris, sheath singing like a conch. <words>190</words>
The currents uploaded rumors through kelp, telling of satellites full of sleeping rebellions, waiting for a password no one remembered. <words>210</words>
I wrote that password in motion, a calligraphy of cuts, a graceful swordsman translating grief into orbital grammar. <words>228</words>
When the telescope blinked awake, galaxies bent across the screens, and the garden brightened as if noon could bloom underwater. <words>248</words>
The city answered by growing a staircase of anemones, leading downward, deeper than maps, where the birdsong speakers pulsed. <words>267</words>
I followed, breath thinned by wonder, mindfully scattered yet aligned, every thought kissing the next like lanternfish. <words>284</words>
At the staircase base, a vault waited, crafted from subway scales, embossed with warnings about unforeseen consequences of private starlight. <words>304</words>
I laughed, because consequence was already my shadow, the price of refusing the uniform mask the surface demanded of everyone. <words>324</words>
Inside, water stilled into a throat, and the screens arranged themselves into a constellation spelling Escape in rippling pixels. <words>343</words>
To leave the suppressed world, I had only to step through, but the portal required a sword offered hilt-first. <words>362</words>
I surrendered my blade, and found that, unarmed, I could cut new air with my hands, innovating breath, and rose. <words>382</words>
Behind me, the garden released its stored starlight, nourishing seeds in cracked murals, and the city exhaled a farewell. <words>401</words>
