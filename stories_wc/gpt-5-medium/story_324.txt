In the hush of a simmering future, I served as the insecure advisor nobody fully trusted. <words>16</words>
Our secret agent headquarters used to glitter with certainty, but tonight it felt like a fractured idyll. <words>33</words>
Mission boards flickered, maps stuttered, and every hallway hummed with the clearly ambiguous promise of victory. <words>49</words>
I was there to chase a rumor beyond all reason, a whisper that refused to be briefed. <words>66</words>
It said a dreamer's calling had been bottled, dissected, and hidden where no clearance could reach. <words>82</words>
Through the echo of footsteps in an abandoned place, the coordinates found me rather than the reverse. <words>99</words>
Basement four smelled like old raincoats and difficult compromises, a museum of mistakes curated by regret. <words>115</words>
I followed the echoing map until a lab door breathed open, exhaling cold air and indecision. <words>131</words>
Inside, a brain in a jar sat on a plinth, neat label affixed: duplicate. <words>145</words>
The word trembled like a lie told by someone honest. <words>155</words>
My training said catalog evidence, radio superiors, await permission. <words>164</words>
My hunger jabbed me in the ribs and answered with a different protocol. <words>177</words>
I spoke aloud, asking the jar who it used to be, and the room listened. <words>192</words>
The answer arrived as a careful drip of condensation and a filing cabinet rattling two doors down. <words>209</words>
I walked after the rattle, letting the echo of my footsteps do the talking to whatever ghosts handled intake. <words>228</words>
The drawer slid open on a personnel file stamped with my name and a notation, clearly ambiguous. <words>245</words>
Beside it, a second file listed the brain, same competencies, same failures, same recurring dream. <words>260</words>
Every night we both heard oceans inside circuit boards, and woke craving salt we could never taste. <words>277</words>
The rumor I chased had always been me, but rumored better, rumored intact, rumored awake. <words>292</words>
I returned to the jar and saw my reflection stitched across its glass like a borrowed face. <words>309</words>
The brain pulsed once, a polite jab at the membrane, and the lights dimmed as if swallowing. <words>326</words>
I understood then that headquarters had abandoned itself, leaving us to advise ourselves into collapses we could file. <words>344</words>
To choose was to finish the mission; to hesitate was to keep the idyll fractured and safe. <words>361</words>
I lifted the jar, feeling its cold reprieve, and walked toward the service corridor no one monitored. <words>378</words>
Each step argued itself, but the path stayed speaking through the echo of footsteps in an abandoned place. <words>396</words>
Ahead lay daylight, clearly ambiguous as prophecy, and somewhere beyond it the calling I had always already answered. <words>414</words>
I was adviser and advised, dream and dreamer, rumor and proof, duplicate and origin, solvent and wound. <words>431</words>
In the hush, I stepped past reason and into the future, carrying the jar like a fragile anthem. <words>449</words>
It answered me without words, the dreamer's calling shaped by my insecurity into something finally unafraid. <words>465</words>
And the headquarters, empty but listening, arranged our departure into a report that sounded like hope. <words>481</words>
