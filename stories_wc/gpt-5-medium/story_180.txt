The sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks groaned whenever the tide rubbed its ribs of glass. <words>16</words>
I lived inside it as a remorseful conjurer, cultivating drowned apples and apologies in equal rows. <words>32</words>
From the ceiling dangled a single knitting needle, a lightning rod for ideas too thin to touch the ground. <words>51</words>
I spoke with indifferent enthusiasm to the salt-fat bees who navigated by barnacled constellations. <words>65</words>
They were obviously mysterious, yet plain enough to gather dust on my breath. <words>78</words>
Each week throughout yard sales along the drowned coast, I traded spells for images, stains, and stories trapped in items people could bear to lose. <words>103</words>
The best bargain came in the form of an antique microscope, its brass throat pitted like moonseed. <words>120</words>
Its seller whispered the lens would dampen grief if I aligned it with a relic that knew my hands. <words>139</words>
I remembered the knitting needle, slick with old lightning and orchard sap, so I held it beneath the microscope. <words>158</words>
The manual was only a riddle: open the mind by matching the swirl of fingerprints on an antique microscope. <words>177</words>
I spent hours studying my thumbprints in the steamed glass, aligning whorls with the metal's faint scars until click became prayer. <words>198</words>
When the match settled, a window opened inside the saltwater, and the greenhouse filled with a hush like pruned snow. <words>218</words>
Through it walked a younger version of me, still unbroken by the stage, carrying a crate labeled shared wisdom. <words>237</words>
He set the crate beside the needle and said the frontier was not out there but inside, and maps were meant for burning. <words>260</words>
We traded testimonies with indifferent enthusiasm, like cousins at a wake trying on hats, and the bees pinned us with their navigational hum. <words>283</words>
He confessed how every trick had been an escape from the harder practice of belief, and I admitted the same, the greenhouse nodding in its moorings. <words>309</words>
To rediscover the wild frontier of your mind, he said, you must ruin the stage and plant the spotlight as a tree, then harvest its shadows without flinching. <words>337</words>
I took the knitting needle and stitched a line of bubbles from hull to hull, mending the shipwrecks into a harbor for lost thoughts. <words>361</words>
The microscope, satisfied, let fall a drop of brine that dampened the apples, and each fruit replayed a lesson I had refused. <words>383</words>
One apple showed a street market where I once bought fireworks of advice and lit none, another showed the moment I misnamed love a lucky mechanism. <words>409</words>
Shared wisdom, the younger me explained, is a tide: it returns what you drop, but only after sanding it to an obviously mysterious shine. <words>433</words>
When he left, he took nothing except my longing, and in that emptied space I felt the frontier uncurl like a chart of warm currents. <words>458</words>
