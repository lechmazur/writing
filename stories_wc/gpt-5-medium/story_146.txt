I posed as a fortune teller, though my visions were inconveniently real and arrived like sparks landing in dry straw. <words>20</words>
In springtime, throughout planting, I traveled to the capital to study sacred development in an extinct language archive rumored to breathe. <words>41</words>
Getting lost in a new city and discovering a hidden gem had always been my method, and the archive hid like a stone under water. <words>66</words>
I found it behind a trolley yard, where copper rails hummed with peaceful anger at the interruption of roots pushing up. <words>87</words>
The curator was a woman who regularly seldom smiled, a paradox that made sense only after she heard my intentions. <words>107</words>
She ushered me to a locked chamber and asked why I, a carnival oracle, wanted to explore the dead tongues of farmers and priests. <words>131</words>
Because my patrons think I sell illusions, but the visions keep insisting on seeds, irrigation, and hymns, and I need the grammar behind them. <words>155</words>
She blinked like a shutter and produced a bone flute discovered in a crypt during a canal excavation, its mouth darkened by old breath. <words>179</words>
Play, she said, and I felt the taken chances of my life crowd around me like unharvested fields asking for rain. <words>200</words>
I did not know the notes; still, when I blew, the chamber filled with syllables that plowed silence the way oxen open earth. <words>223</words>
The curator translated enough to warn me that the language resisted readers who sought power, but welcomed those who wanted to study sacred development. <words>247</words>
I told her my fury was not for dominion, only for misuse, a peaceful anger boiling whenever charlatans profited while soil and story eroded. <words>271</words>
She nodded, and together we tuned the flute to cross-reference crude diagrams of furrows, weather marks, and ritual pauses preserved in clay. <words>293</words>
The visions steadied into maps of terraces and calendars of moons, urging me to return outdoors, to walk the neighborhoods where onions sprouted between rails. <words>318</words>
We stepped outside, got deliberately lost, and the city revealed a hidden gem of gardens tended by janitors and welders practicing the old hymns. <words>342</words>
I played, and the gardeners laughed that the tune matched how they regularly seldom watered, choosing moonlit intervals the ancestors called rest. <words>364</words>
By exploring their practice and the archive's breath, I learned to let visions lead rather than sell them, a better trick than fortune telling. <words>388</words>
When the fields took, and seedlings rose throughout planting, the flute spoke less of omens and more of gratitude, proof that taken chances had found language. <words>414</words>
