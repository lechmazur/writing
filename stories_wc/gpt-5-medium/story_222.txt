In the extraterrestrial embassy, the air shimmered with calculated dreams and untranslatable etiquette. <words>13</words>
Before the first dance begins, the delegations mill like patient comets spinning slow courtship orbits around trays of mineral waters. <words>33</words>
I am the secretive conjurer hired as entertainment, but my contract hides a deeper clause. <words>48</words>
They believe my illusions are philosophically shallow, a garnish for diplomats, while I stalk a truer prey. <words>65</words>
I seek to harness the power of nature, to tame the embassy's breathing walls and the weather engines humming beneath the marble. <words>87</words>
A small, threadbare washcloth is folded in my sleeve, less a prop than a relic of failure. <words>104</words>
Once, I wrung oceans from the sky with it, then could not teach the waters mercy. <words>120</words>
Tonight, an heirloom piece of jewelry sparks a story, a filament to guide me through layered motives. <words>137</words>
Ambassador Oris of the Spiral Choir wears a pendant forged from lightning trapped in glass, its pulse answering mine. <words>156</words>
I ask permission to perform a cleansing rite on the pendant, invoking custom, while the musicians tune and the parquet waits. <words>177</words>
Oris nods, the Choir eager to witness human ceremony, however ornamental our people think it. <words>192</words>
I place the pendant upon the washcloth and whisper a tale of rivers learning patience, letting compassion settle in layers. <words>212</words>
As the story deepens, the washcloth drinks the hum of hidden conduits, mapping the embassy's veins across my palm. <words>231</words>
Calculated dreams align like instrument needles, and I see the weather engines listening for a kinder command. <words>248</words>
The delegates drift closer, their previous judgments softening as they recognize not spectacle but stewardship. <words>263</words>
I ask the embassy to lower its artificial tides, to release the anxious static that keeps strangers bristled. <words>281</words>
The engines obey, and the air relaxes, a room deliberately tamed rather than theatrically stunned. <words>296</words>
Yet the price of such obedience is confession, so I open my history the way a river opens a canyon. <words>316</words>
I tell Oris how I once tried to tame a storm over a burning forest, how my arrogance sharpened the wind and tore villages apart. <words>341</words>
The washcloth survived, charred and grieving, a reminder to never mistake control for care, or applause for understanding. <words>359</words>
Layers of compassion are not theories, I say, but practices that shape the direction water seeks after the rock is moved. <words>380</words>
Oris places a second hand over mine, admitting the Choir once tuned a sun too brightly and scorched a nursery of moons. <words>402</words>
Between us, the pendant steadies, its lightning no longer trapped, merely persuaded to circulate with the breath of the room. <words>422</words>
The musicians raise their bows, and the parquet gleams, and we agree to begin the dance with our instruments tuned to mercy. <words>444</words>
Before the first step, the embassy sighs, its nature gentled yet unbroken, and I pocket the washcloth for the next hard conversation. <words>466</words>
