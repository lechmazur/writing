<story>Nectar dusk draped the lightning collection tower like slow honey cooling on a spoon. [14]
I kept the toll there, a small desk of scars and receipts, and my candor. [29]
People dislike candor unless it saves them time, but mine saved me from lies. [43]
I am involuntarily truthful, an awkward condition in a city that worships polish. [56]
After the city-wide blackout, no one wanted polish anyway. [65]
We lost hum, honey, screens, and the reliable boredom of things working. [77]
The tower was our restart prayer, a spire that sipped thunder when storms wandered. [91]
Below it, I took coins and questions, assigning passage with a logic older than algorithms. [106]
My toll was rarely money; it was wonder, paid in small risks of imagination. [120]
I used a matchbox containing a cryptic riddle for those who claimed urgency. [133]
Solve it and pass, fail it and wait, listening to the hive-warm twilight. [146]
That evening, Mara arrived with tools, eyes ringed in charcoal fatigue, palms smelling of smoke. [161]
She was an apiarist of code, a maintainer of the drone beehive lattices. [174]
Their failure had soured the parks and emptied the orchards, even the citizen rooftops. [188]
Without the drones, flowers bloomed like questions, untended, unanswered, and importantly, unseen. [200]
She asked for the stair key to the crown platform where the capacitors sleep. [214]
Truth pinned my tongue and freed my hands; I held up the matchbox. [227]
You know the cost, I said, and I meant wonder, not coin. [239]
She cracked the lid; inside lay a paper moth of a riddle, creased from passage. [254]
What keeps thunder in a box, and teaches bees to grieve by singing. [267]
She frowned, then smiled, because she had seen my desk and the tower's crown. [281]
A lacquer box, she answered, the harmonics housing, the queen of calibration. [293]
Correct, I said, and pulled the tray where a red-black sheen waited like a heartbeat. [308]
I had kept it hidden, not from law, but from those who rushed without reverence. [323]
Wonder needs a ritual, even in crisis, perhaps especially then. [333]
The lacquer box held the living tone the drones used to align their dances. [347]
In blackout, their ears went metal, and their waggle spoke only of absence. [360]
Without the queen tone, a drone beehive failure is not collapse, but forgetting. [373]
They remember how to move and not why, and fields answer with silence. [386]
Come, I told her, and truth tugged me up the iron stairs beside her. [400]
My impulse was not heroism, only the stubborn desire to preserve wonder in routine. [414]
Ritual heals repetition, I have learned, and gives returning its glimmer. [425]
At the crown, the capacitors lay like sleeping drums, the rods smelling of stormfruit. [439]
Mara set her tools, and I set the box between us, its lacquer whispering. [453]
Open it, she said, and I could not refuse, because truth is also obedience. [467]
Inside, the queen tone slept in a crystal wafer cradled by dark wood. [480]
When the first lightning breath thread down, we fed its tremor through the wafer. [494]
The tower answered with a thrum like bees discovering a meadow after winter. [507]
Mara listened and calibrated, but I was listening for something else, the reveal. [520]
Not of secrets, because I own none, but of purpose rising like a chorus. [534]
The drones woke across the terraces, reciting coordinates in dances that meant nectar and news. [549]
Screens brightened like petals, and the city inhaled, not relief only, but renewed curiosity. [563]
Mara clasped the box and asked if I had planned this all along. [576]
Truth spoke ahead of me, as usual, as if it had rented my lungs. [590]
I wanted the right listener, I said, because wonder prefers careful company. [602]
Without it, we forget why we climb, and why we build jars for lightning. [616]
She nodded as if agreeing with weather, then pointed beyond, to the orange parkline. [630]
The drones flowed there like punctuation returning to sentences, bees finishing interrupted thoughts. [643]
You could charge for swiftness, she said, but you charge for stories instead. [656]
I do not charge, I answered, I ask payment that keeps my work alive. [670]
Down the stairs, citizens queued again, eager to resume the comfort of repeating. [683]
I would tend their passage with riddles that opened more than doors. [695]
Mara left, carrying the box to the hive servers, like a lantern. [707]
I took my place again as the candid toll keeper between the city and its climb. [723]
Around us, nectar dusk deepened, and even the steel smelled faintly of bloom. [736]
I revealed the hidden tray because truth leaves no pocket for delay. [748]</story>
