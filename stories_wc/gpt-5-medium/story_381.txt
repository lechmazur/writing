Between sets of scanner sweeps, I listened to the hushed necromancer trace our breaths like music against the crystalline cave. <words>20</words>
We were there to map cave systems no one had seen since the glaciers pulled their veils back and night learned to shine. <words>43</words>
The necromancer wore a scuffed baseball cap tilted backward, a relic stubbornly surviving in our hydrogen-lantern century. <words>60</words>
Its brim cast futuristic nostalgia across the crystals, as if time itself had polished the quartz with home movies and longing. <words>81</words>
The necromancer spoke softly, summoning not ghosts but the sound of resolve, the quiet clatter when fear finally chooses a direction. <words>102</words>
Down there, air and time were scarcely abundant, and every glimmering chamber tested the endurance of our batteries and our friendship. <words>123</words>
We navigated by jokes and lines from noir reels, a shared love for old movies syncing our pulses when the sonar hiccuped. <words>145</words>
Where the cave sought to dominate us with maze logic, we quoted a rain-soaked monologue and sketched arrows on flexible glass. <words>166</words>
My motivation was simple: to map cave systems until the planet's belowground matched the star charts above, so explorers would stop vanishing. <words>188</words>
For the necromancer, purpose was quieter: free the trapped echoes of miners whose last thoughts had congealed into crystalline static. <words>208</words>
He taught me that echoes could be cartography, each resonance a contour line, each tremble a bridge sketched by breath. <words>228</words>
When dread rose, he would thumb the scuffed baseball cap, and the sound of resolve returned like a projector catching the sprockets. <words>250</words>
Between sets, while the lidar cooled and the drones recharged, we rewound favorite frames, letting them guide us toward shafts where signal failed. <words>273</words>
There, he raised his hands and hushed the universe, asking it to listen as living people do when the ending matters. <words>294</words>
Rustles became coordinates; grief became latitude; together we drew a corridor where star fungus shimmered like streetlights in rain. <words>313</words>
The map took shape as a chorus that could not be sold, only followed, a scarcely abundant resource we promised to leave unhoarded. <words>336</words>
Yet every passage demanded a toll: a memory offered to the cave, a scene from an old film we would never watch again. <words>359</words>
I gave it the final freeze-frame of my father waving outside a bus, and the tunnel widened like a patient learning to trust. <words>382</words>
The necromancer surrendered a childhood matinee where rockets blinked, then tipped his cap and smiled at ghosts we could not see. <words>403</words>
By the time we surfaced, the sound of resolve walked beside us, crystalline and human, a map that remembered we were temporary. <words>425</words>
