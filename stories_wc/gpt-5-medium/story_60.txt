Between bells, the indifferent blacksmith descended into the maze-like catacombs beneath the grand cathedral. <words>14</words>
Cold soot still mapped his forearms from a forge that had collapsed with the nave, leaving him rising from rubble with iron in his lungs. <words>39</words>
He had come in that hush not for prayer but to seal a covenant with the unknown. <words>56</words>
He believed only in work, and in work he had learned the unknown waits like ore inside stone. <words>74</words>
To speak in that language, he carried a collection of objects that tell a story. <words>89</words>
A bent horseshoe, a nail twisted by fire, a child's bell from the fallen choir, and a faded ribbon knotted like a question. <words>112</words>
He set them in a circle on the damp floor, iron smelling uniquely natural among bones and limestone. <words>130</words>
Between bells, sound is a skin around the world, and he listened for its thinning. <words>145</words>
He was known in the quarter as indifferent, a man who neither praised nor cursed his forge, who only hammered. <words>165</words>
Yet, when the nave cracked and the roof sighed down, he pulled bodies free, then tools, then memory. <words>183</words>
Rising from rubble became a habit of his hands that had once only shaped horses' steps. <words>199</words>
Now he hawed softly, haw at first, clearing dust and doubt from his throat, and spoke the names of the objects aloud. <words>221</words>
Horseshoe for the circle that keeps going, nail for the pain that holds, bell for the breath we count, ribbon for the question. <words>244</words>
The walls sweated old incense, and the candle he lit made a pool in which those things looked like stars fallen to puddle. <words>267</words>
The unknown, he thought, is no stranger, only the room beyond the next arch, always dark until you walk there. <words>287</words>
So he began the covenant by placing the bell against the stone, the horseshoe over it, the nail across both, and the faded ribbon around all. <words>313</words>
He pressed his browned thumb to the ribbon's knot and felt, uniquely natural, a pulse pass back like a quiet hammer stroke. <words>335</words>
A draft moved, pages somewhere whispered, and the candle guttering outlined a figure in no shape he could learn, and he did not flinch. <words>359</words>
Indifferent does not mean empty, he told himself; it means clean of lie, and clean iron takes a truer edge. <words>379</words>
He offered his vow with the silence of a smithy before the strike, and the unknown, in turn, offered a pattern to follow. <words>402</words>
He saw it in the way the objects aligned their shadows, a map of arches and chambers that would lead work and people up from ruin. <words>428</words>
When the next bell rang, the circle broke like a clasp, and he lifted the sign, rose, and began to climb. <words>449</words>
Between bells again, the city would stir, and he would return with a hammer and this thread of ribbon to tell the way. <words>472</words>
He had no need to speak of miracles, only to lay iron where it belonged, and let rising from rubble do the talking. <words>495</words>
