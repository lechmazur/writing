I audit the end of time like another elective, an eternal college student studying immortality with detached devotion. <words>18</words>
The syllabus is the dark itself, after the last star burns out and the exams never stop. <words>35</words>
I live in the underground city of the mole people, where history crawls in quiet tunnels like diligent roots. <words>54</words>
They adopted me when I arrived carrying a coal miner's headlamp from a collapsed mine, its lens scratched by extinguished suns. <words>75</words>
It shines only when I think of breath, which is as close to prayer as I allow myself. <words>93</words>
The mole people call the lamp mundanely glorious, a small sun resigned to labor beneath vanished heavens. <words>110</words>
They trade me their maps and I trade them my late lectures, codicils of bones and cafeteria coffee, via swapped travel journals. <words>132</words>
We document the routes of endurance, each line a reminder that gifted burdens choose us long before we name them. <words>152</words>
Their historian, Old Shale, teaches me to digitize the journals with heatprints, because electricity is a myth we narrate to children. <words>173</words>
I nod, because I, too, curate myths, especially the one that says a curriculum can sculpt the soul and pass its exams. <words>195</words>
My motive is simple the way obsidian is simple: to become a master of one's own reality, even if reality keeps molting. <words>217</words>
Yet mastery here means listening to stones until they confess, then committing to carry their confessions without noise. <words>235</words>
Old Shale gives me a tunnel, says it is mine to maintain, and the gift is a longitude of ache that steadies my hands. <words>259</words>
I wear the headlamp and read the strata like margins, noting every fossilized seed, every knuckle of the planet's discarded attempts at bloom. <words>282</words>
Some nights the city hums with communal drills, and my notebook records their rhythms in a script that looks like vertebrae. <words>303</words>
We archive the hum to remember that silence kills memory faster than collapse. <words>316</words>
When I finally index all entries, I realize the journals are mirrors, and each swapped itinerary frames me as both pilgrim and fossil. <words>339</words>
The revelation is mundanely glorious, the way a bruise is proof of a lesson you passed by surviving it. <words>358</words>
I do not celebrate; I inventory. <words>364</words>
I inventory how the headlamp refuses to die, how the tunnels lean into me as if adjusting their posture to my breath. <words>386</words>
I inventory that my eternal semester is graded by cave-ins averted, by rescues achieved, by letters never sent to professors who would not answer. <words>410</words>
Mastery, it seems, is agreeing to be shaped by gifted burdens until your outline fits the archive that outlives every sky. <words>431</words>
So I press the switch on the old lamp, and its beam narrows like a vow, and together we revise the curriculum of darkness. <words>455</words>
My degree will be the city continuing after me, and also within me, which is the only test left when starlight has nothing further to teach. <words>481</words>
