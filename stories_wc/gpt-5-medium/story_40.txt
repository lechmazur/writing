<story>The forgotten recipe library smells like cinnamon dust and damp paper, which sounds tastier than it reads. <words>17</words>
I shelve obsolete soup scrolls while fish patterns swim across my memory like errant captions. <words>32</words>
I am Mina, a reincarnated goldfish turned caretaker of goldfish, tentatively fierce in my gentle occupation. <words>48</words>
My boss calls this annex a preservation shrine, but I hear guilt's haunting echo every time a recipe praises clear broth. <words>69</words>
Once, in a tank, I watched children tap their courage against glass; now I catalog their grandmothers tapping ladles against history. <words>90</words>
I am here to disrupt a stagnant tradition that mistakes dust for wisdom and appetite for fate. <words>107</words>
Before the doctor's chart confirms a turning point for my volunteer clearance, I mean to edit at least one sacrosanct stew. <words>128</words>
The afternoon begins bright and boring, then a sudden change of weather leads to a chance encounter with thunder and a stranger. <words>150</words>
Rain slashes the skylight, and he limps in, a one-armed cook holding a toy soldier with a missing arm like a joke he is tired of telling. <words>177</words>
He says the soldier keeps him honest, the way a cracked bowl insists on soup staying humble. <words>194</words>
I show him the Fish Triumphant section, and he laughs with playful cynicism sharp enough to fillet tradition but not people. <words>215</words>
He introduces himself as Corin, late of certain cuisines and uncertain campaigns, and asks what I really want. <words>233</words>
To alleviate hunger without erasing anyone else's breath, I say, and I mean fish too, especially the loud ones who speak only with gills. <words>257</words>
Corin taps the toy soldier on a spine that reads Victory Chow, and his face folds around a memory like paper around a bone. <words>281</words>
On a river he cannot forget, he served carp to men who never came back, and for years he blamed stock instead of orders. <words>305</words>
Guilt's haunting echo, he says, tastes like salt long after the bowl is washed. <words>319</words>
We draw up a plan that could pass for mischief: annotate the fish chapters with reversible edits, plant seaweed stand-ins, and write margins that dare readers to imagine release instead of capture. <words>351</words>
If caught, I will plead culinary evolution, which sounds polite until you notice the kitchens have not evolved since the last empire boiled everything tender. <words>376</words>
Corin nods, tentatively fierce too, and we begin with a classic, excusing the fish to live and inviting mushrooms to hold the broth. <words>399</words>
The rain lifts like a curtain, and a child wanders in chasing a draft, the toy soldier's tiny twin clutched inside a dripping sleeve. <words>423</words>
The child salutes Corin without knowing why, sits at our table, and chooses seaweed the color of calm. <words>441</words>
Before the doctor's chart confirms a turning point for me tomorrow, I taste the draft stew we invented and feel something unclench. <words>463</words>
It is not redemption, only seasoning, but it might be enough to pivot a library and soften a life. <words>482</words>
Outside, the gutters sing, inside, the recipes listen, and guilt turns from warden to guide. <words>497</words></story>
