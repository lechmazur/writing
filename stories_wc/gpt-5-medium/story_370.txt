<story>Between work shifts, I sit in the humming lab and watch models of quantum foam bubble like shy galaxies. <words>19</words>
The lights never rest, but I do, because being purposefully lost is how I keep my bearings. <words>36</words>
I am a passive conspirator, the kind who holds a door two seconds longer and calls it courtesy. <words>54</words>
The interns move past with hesitant smiles, and I placate the cameras by looking bored, janitorial, inevitable. <words>71</words>
On the bench beside my badge rests a tattered superhero comic, its spine repaired with patience and tape. <words>89</words>
The hero redraws broken cities, but always outside the lines drawn by fear, which is my secret motive too. <words>108</words>
My father read it to me under a desert wind that erased our footprints faster than we could name ourselves. <words>128</words>
He said the only map worth trusting is the one that shifts with the drift of desert sands. <words>146</words>
So I move like that map, adjusting doorstops, coffee cups, and alibis, small grains that reroute an avalanche. <words>164</words>
Inside the collider, particles twirl their ancient courtship, a dance of generations rehearsed before fire learned language. <words>181</words>
Outside, the newest interns try steps they were warned against, improvising with equations and unblessed time. <words>197</words>
I time the mop strokes to the security rounds, a metronome that tells them when to breathe and dare. <words>216</words>
My boss prefers checklists, but I offer him small talk about weather and football, the softest tranquilizer available. <words>234</words>
He thinks I lack ambition, and he is right, just not in the way that would keep the world timid. <words>254</words>
Ambition here is the quiet art of making space for other people to color outside lines drawn by fear. <words>273</words>
When a quench alarm chirps, I trip the breaker late, just enough to seem clumsy and buy a minute. <words>292</words>
The minute becomes a corridor where discovery hurries barefoot, feet raw, heart unafraid. <words>305</words>
In that corridor, the comic waits like an ancestor, passing down a cape sewn from questions and unspoken oaths. <words>324</words>
Pages freckled by sand hold margins where my father wrote, Do good and disappear, then return with the tide. <words>343</words>
There is no tide here, only clocks and static, but the quantum foam mimics oceans when you blur your eyes. <words>363</words>
I hold the comic close and let the buried optimism inside me breathe, a seed under concrete stealing rain. <words>382</words>
Soon the interns will surface, flushed with almosts and maybes, and I will wipe away their footprints with studied clumsiness. <words>402</words>
I will log a delay that reads like weather, and the supervisors will nod, their doubts placated by routine. <words>421</words>
When the next shift claims me, I will still be purposefully lost, and still precisely where I am needed. <words>440</words>
The world says pick a side, but I choose to be a bridge made of pauses, a conspirator of breath. <words>460</words>
In the pause, generations learn the steps, and the dance goes on, never heroic, always human, always ours. <words>478</words></story>
