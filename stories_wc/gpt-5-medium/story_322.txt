I arrived in the silent abyss like a door to door comet, a traveling salesman of oddities seeking buyers among echoes. <words>21</words>
My samples rattled inside a rustic water pitcher, dented by distances and the arguments of previous transactions. <words>38</words>
I had come, I explained with mocking sincerity, to quantify the vanishing arts before their last practitioners vanished. <words>56</words>
They applauded by not making a sound, which I took as favorable market research in a place where silence had seniority. <words>77</words>
Throughout repairs to their unlit bridges and echoing stairways, I set up my ledger on a reef of shadow. <words>96</words>
My method was rationally whimsical, to weigh absence against longing with the rhythm of a pendulum. <words>112</words>
I told them a tick was a hypothesis and a tock was a bill, and they laughed by lowering their tides. <words>133</words>
A parliament of mute fish drafted bylaws in sand, authorizing me to survey the missing music and invoice what could not be heard. <words>156</words>
I toured their galleries of unsung lullabies, their museums of unwhistled mornings, and I cataloged each hush with transparent ink. <words>176</words>
Sometimes the pendulum caught on a memory and refused to swing, as if the abyss had a heartbeat and royalties. <words>196</words>
During those pauses, I drank the dry idea of water from the pitcher and asked what interconnectedness meant when every voice was a shoreline. <words>220</words>
The abyss replied by braiding currents around my ankles, and I felt like a bead sliding on a string held by the moon. <words>243</words>
It said, if one stairway is repaired, every echo learns new steps, so mind your receipts. <words>259</words>
I pivoted with the rhythm of a pendulum again, this time measuring how repairs changed the price of silence and the cost of nearness. <words>283</words>
A child with gills brought me a cracked hourglass, asking whether sand and stars were the same inventory seen from different shelves. <words>305</words>
I answered with mocking sincerity that I could quantify their kinship only by sharing my pitcher and waiting for thirst to agree. <words>327</words>
We poured nothing together, and the nothing tasted communal, like a chorus warming up behind an unopened curtain. <words>345</words>
The ledger grew heavy with absences, and my shoulder ached from carrying proof that connections are debts we pay in attention. <words>366</words>
When the bridges finally held, the abyss returned my change: a new silence that echoed like gratitude, counted in breaths instead of coins. <words>389</words>
I packed the rustic water pitcher, now bright with use, and stamped my seal on the contract between distance and its listeners. <words>411</words>
Leaving, I swung like a pendulum through the last repair dust and understood that to learn the true meaning of interconnectedness was to be swung. <words>436</words>
Thus concluded my demonstration of vanishing arts, signed by tide, cosigned by echo, and witnessed by the market research of absolute quiet. <words>458</words>
