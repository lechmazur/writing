In the cradle of a whispered minute, an unstable dimension hiccuped like a skittish tidepool around my ankles. <words>18</words>
I am a fact-minded oracle, desperately casual in posture, meticulous in proofs, walking with a brass compass that prefers honesty to north. <words>40</words>
My quest is to find forgotten places, because the path to empathy disappears first from maps and only then from hearts. <words>61</words>
So I calibrate the compass against losses I cannot recompose, registering each ache as a true bearing through the rippling sky. <words>82</words>
The hour here folds and unfolds, and I sail sidewalks that curl like paper, buoyed by optimistic desperation that outpaces the stutter of gravity. <words>106</words>
Every tremor shakes out images, and via heartbreak-induced visions I receive coordinates no cartographer would admit, though the evidence keeps arriving like rain. <words>129</words>
I once loved someone who vanished through a seam in the sidewalk, a human-shaped omission, and the echo of that subtraction makes numbers of my dreams. <words>155</words>
If grief is geometry, then empathy is the bridge that holds when proofs collapse, and my task is to test its span with careful steps. <words>180</words>
The dimension rearranges street names into sighs, so I keep speaking plainly, desperately casual, as if mapping were simply conversation with a shy horizon. <words>204</words>
Numbers reassure me: seven alleys between breaths, four bridges to the old cinema where the screen shows weather forecasts for the soul. <words>226</words>
I consult the brass compass, which spins, then steadies when I whisper a name I am afraid to remember, and the asphalt shivers open like curtains. <words>252</words>
Down there, between syllables, the city recomposes itself into a forgotten station where benches are carved with apologies that no one finished writing. <words>275</words>
I take notes, not to archive the ache, but to convert it into directions others can follow without falling, because facts are kindness when they lead safely. <words>302</words>
There I meet a child made of bird calls, abandoned by a rumor, and we test the bridge of empathy by exchanging losses like travelers trade coins. <words>329</words>
When the child laughs, my visions sting bright, and I understand that to find forgotten places I must also forget the self that hoards its coordinates. <words>355</words>
So I hand over my compass, and together we recompose the route by noticing every quiet person, every overlooked doorway, until the map breathes like lungs. <words>381</words>
The unstable dimension settles its edges, shyly, as if pleased to be understood, and time sways but does not spill. <words>401</words>
In that pause, in the cradle of a whispered minute, I realize empathy is not a destination but a navigational constant. <words>422</words>
It keeps the compass honest, keeps me desperately casual when certainty would bruise, and steadies my steps toward everyone yet to be found. <words>445</words>
