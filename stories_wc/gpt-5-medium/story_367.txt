I am a sapped herbalist posted in a glass walled observatory on an ocean cliff. <words>15</words>
The trustees suspect my herbs can civilize storms, but I am here only to study tide patterns. <words>32</words>
I keep notes during napping, when vigilance lets go and the sea is honest. <words>46</words>
Each afternoon I sink into the cot beneath the dome, practicing a fervent indifference to thunder and acclaim. <words>64</words>
There, I listen as water triturates the cliff, and I measure its syllables by the flight path of a lone goose. <words>85</words>
The goose is punctual, the sky a ledger, and my pulse the metronome I cannot quite convince to matter. <words>104</words>
My apothecary case holds roots without ambition and a blacksmith's bellows I use to urge faint embers into obedient draughts. <words>124</words>
I borrowed the bellows from a forge that smelted anchors and burnt the idea of permanence into my lungs. <words>143</words>
Perfection, the black slick dream of the coastline, has a price that never posts itself until after purchase. <words>161</words>
I learned this from tinctures that cured the symptom and erased the song, and from storms that obeyed and then forgot us. <words>183</words>
So I am thoughtfully thoughtless, letting fatigue solve equations my hungry mind would only prod into hurt. <words>200</words>
During naps the observatory becomes a lung, the panes breathing fog and brine, and I cherish its failure to decide for me. <words>222</words>
Dreams rummage my pockets for abandoned leaves, and now and again they tug my hand toward the ledger. <words>240</words>
There I draw the curve of the rip current that yesterday stole a dory, tracing it with a knuckle dampened in sleep. <words>262</words>
The goose veers precisely where the undertow schools, and I mark the veer with a cross that looks like a breath held. <words>284</words>
I do not chase meaning, yet the angles collude, and numbers tidy themselves like jars after the patient leaves. <words>303</words>
Sometimes the bellows wheeze as the stove cools, and the sound becomes a warning about the price of perfection. <words>322</words>
You can force a flame to behave until it refuses to live, and I have barely not done that to myself. <words>343</words>
So I practice fervent indifference to applause and ash, tending not the fire but the air that consents to feed it. <words>364</words>
The tides accept my sleeping ledger and pay in small rescues, fishermen returning, kelp unknotted, gulls forgetting their vendettas. <words>383</words>
I do not publish, because ink would sharpen what need not cut, and because the sea hates signatures. <words>401</words>
Instead I leave the bellows beside the cot, a quiet emblem of a craft that shapes only the shapeable. <words>420</words>
When the goose fails to appear, I read the omission as a reef, and I mark absence with a gentler ink of sleep. <words>443</words>
What I cherish is not mastery but mercy, the moment a map refuses to punish a body for walking it. <words>463</words>
If perfection ever arrives, I will show it the bellows, ask it to breathe, and watch it learn the cost. <words>483</words>
