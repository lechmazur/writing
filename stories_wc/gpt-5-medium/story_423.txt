<story>The earnest knight walked along a ruined aqueduct crossing an arid desert, armor warmed to a memory he never wished to trade. <words>22</words>
He carried an astronomical map whose corners curled like old leaves, ink crisp as dusk, smelling faintly of salt and applewood. <words>43</words>
Its constellations felt unknowingly familiar, as if the sky had borrowed his childhood and returned it with precise, tender annotations. <words>63</words>
He traveled between mountain passes in his mind, though only dunes and bleached ribs of stone rose around his steady steps. <words>84</words>
Home waited far north, a land of ice starving for heat, where he had sworn to spark flames before another winter smothered breath. <words>107</words>
The map, legend of rivers in the heavens, promised a route of kindling stones buried beneath forgotten keystones and shadows of ancient repairs. <words>130</words>
He had learned to read such riddles as a boy, by mapping tears in the roof of a rundown greenhouse. <words>150</words>
Raindrops once fell through those broken panes, pinpricks that aligned with winter stars, an accidental tutor that taught patience and the geometry of longing. <words>174</words>
Now he searched the aqueduct for similar apertures, places where light could trigger secrets stored in lime and wind carved grooves. <words>195</words>
At noon he halted where a broken arch framed the sun, and spread the astronomical map across a slab of patient sandstone. <words>217</words>
The symbols asked for water that no longer ran, but the sky still flowed, and he aligned sky to paper, ruin to hope. <words>240</words>
As shadows sharpened, he recognized a path that braided dry wells with watchtowers, like stitches drawing edges together on the canvas of life. <words>263</words>
He followed, passing thorns that held trapped songs of wind, while lizards blinked like terse priests, overseeing his vow with indifferent approval. <words>285</words>
Near the farthest pier he found a niche of soot, a shrine of labor where builders once warmed their hands with stolen daylight. <words>308</words>
He placed tinder from his pack, struck flint, and the little flame remembered his grandmother, who had whispered that memory could be engineered. <words>331</words>
The heat licked the niche and woke a line of resin trapped in the stone, guiding fire like ink through shallow channels. <words>353</words>
It traveled along the aqueduct, a careful serpent mirrored by sunlight, and the map confirmed this was the artery the cold north lacked. <words>376</words>
If he could shepherd flames from desert resins to polar hearths, winter would blink, and language would thaw on mouths that had fallen silent. <words>400</words>
