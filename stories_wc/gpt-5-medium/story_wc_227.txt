<story>On a night rusted with green fumes, my gears-and-cogs workshop floating on an acid sea groans like a waking leviathan. [20]
I am an uncertain alchemist, and the metal ribs around me creak as if afraid to hold my doubt. [39]
The sea gnaws the pontoons, each kiss a hiss, and the rafters drip a tone of dire enchantment. [57]
I work because the air stings and because I promised myself to conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion. [76]
That promise was light once, now it is lead in my chest, but it keeps time. [92]
Time here is counted between breaths held underwater, when I duck my head into the cooling cistern to spare my lungs. [113]
Each plunge steals a little fear and returns a little clarity, as if the brine edits what the fumes exaggerate. [133]
My hands smell of salt and solder, and they tremble with kintsugi intentions. [146]
I will mend what broke, not to hide the fracture, but to gild it where it teaches me to look. [166]
The object waiting to be mended is not metal alone, it is the story I am afraid to narrate. [185]
A key ring charm dangles from a nail above the bench, a loop of brass with a cracked enamel moon. [205]
It once belonged to Mira, who laughed at my formulas and then fell through the catwalk when the bolts she was counting counted her instead. [230]
The sea took her, and the bubbles were brief as the inventions we never finished. [245]
Since then my mind quilts memories together, piecing blueprints to lullabies, solvents to the smell of her wrists. [263]
I tell myself that if I complete the memory engine she designed, I can ask the right question at last. [283]
The engine is a ribcage of gears and glass bells, and it will only answer if I set its ribs by matching the pockmarks on a centuries-old statue. [311]
Mira found the statue half dissolved, dredged from a reef of drowned monasteries, its surface peppered with craterlets like a night sky. [333]
She said the pocks encoded a map of absence, and that the engine would sing if the ribs matched those scars. [354]
I trace the statue now, my calipers kissing each crater, my breath fogging the glass bell that domes it. [373]
The marks become numbers, the numbers become angles, and the angles become a choreography for the ribs to follow. [392]
Between measurements, I dunk my face again, a pilgrim at a bitter font, and listen for the seconds that survive my plunge. [414]
When I rise, the world hangs beadlike, and I tighten another screw along the golden seam I laid last hour. [434]
The seam is not apology, it is a declaration that we continue in spite of the solvents. [451]
I speak aloud as I work because the engine yawns unless I narrate the logic it will inherit. [469]
My words tap the bells, and the bells tremble as if language were a small hammer showing them their own shape. [490]
The key ring charm watches from its nail, a moon that remembers tides, or invents them. [506]
I take it down and fit it as the final pendulum, because that was the one piece Mira refused to draw. [527]
Her absence is a diagram, and I follow it until the charm clicks into the waiting hook. [544]
The bells hum, the ribs shiver, and the engine drinks the room, leaving only the statue and me in its slow eclipse. [566]
It asks no question, but a wind threads the machine and brings Mira's laugh and the scrape of her boots to the surface of now. [591]
I hold my breath without water, and for a moment the whole workshop forgets to sink. [607]
Then the engine speaks in bells, a grammar of distances, and the statue's pockmarks glow with sourceless starlight. [625]
It names the missing bolts and the last steps we miscounted, and it names the hour when she fell and did not land. [648]
It does not give me her, but it gives me the pattern of her choosing, which is the nearest thing to truth I can breathe. [673]
I solder two final seams along that pattern, tiny rivers of gold that flicker like small exclamations the sea cannot dissolve. [694]
The workshop steadies, the pontoons rising as if the acid forgot its hunger to swallow us. [710]
I whisper that I will finish the rest tomorrow, and the bells agree with a weary concord. [727]
I hang the key ring charm back on its nail, but it swings toward the statue, as if that moon had found a tide again. [752]
The engine settles into sleep, and I settle into mine, unsure still, an uncertain alchemist who has learned to bear a sharpened hope. [775]
Outside, the acid sea keeps its counsel, but inside the ribs a low music keeps me from the edge and keeps me working toward dawn. [800]</story>
