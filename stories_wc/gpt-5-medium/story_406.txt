At the hour when the morning paper lands on an empty porch, I slipped into the witch's potion brewery with borrowed valor. <words>22</words>
I am a coy spy, trained to smile like steam and vanish like drafts between barrels. <words>38</words>
Tonight my motive prickled brighter than the torches: to become a master of disguise before dawn interrogated me. <words>56</words>
A loose button on my overcoat ticked against glassware, a traitor tapping code only remorse could decipher. <words>73</words>
The proprietor, a diabolically benevolent witch, stirred cauldrons whose perfumes rehearsed confessions I had not planned to make. <words>91</words>
She offered mentorship the way ravens offer trinkets, with borrowed valor cloaking the hunger of the beak. <words>108</words>
We spoke of mended fences, the kind hammered from secrets and apologies, where trespassers can pass only by admitting why they trespassed. <words>130</words>
To bypass her wards, I proposed a trade: brew me a draught to walk through reversed time, and I would fix her ruins. <words>153</words>
She laughed, diabolically benevolent, as if mercy were a blade honed on my reflection. <words>167</words>
Bottles chimed, and the floor tilted like a map unfolding; the potion eddied violet, reversing hourglasses inside its belly. <words>186</words>
I drank, and footsteps marched backward up the corridor, my loose button rewinding itself to a thread that remembered loyalty. <words>206</words>
Outside, the street inhaled, and the morning paper leapt from puddle to porch, still warm with ink that had not accused me yet. <words>229</words>
Through reversed time I found the quarrel with my handler before it ignited, and mended fences by returning stolen words to their unsaid past. <words>253</words>
I borrowed valor from future headlines that would call me traitor or saint, and wore it like greasepaint that belonged to neither face. <words>276</words>
For the witch, I reversed the splintering of her shelves and the rifts between her apprentices, mended fences of glass and pride alike. <words>299</words>
Each correction shaved a layer from my own outline, teaching me that to become a master of disguise is to become less owned by oneself. <words>324</words>
At last I could bypass her final sigil, entering a room where mirrors drank light and returned faces I had not yet earned. <words>347</words>
I chose the one with river-still eyes, a self that made amends before offense, a self of mended fences laid within skin. <words>369</words>
The paper landed again on the empty porch, and time resumed, its creases sharp but its headlines softened by the edits I had smuggled. <words>393</words>
The witch bowed, diabolically benevolent as ever, and I left lighter, my loose button now a seal on a life newly tailored. <words>415</words>
If my valor was borrowed, so be it; a coy spy pays every debt by returning what never should have been stolen. <words>437</words>
