<story>The floating observatory rocked like a held breath above the jagged storms of the plateau. [15]
I listened to the circuit breakers cool, their metallic clicks like ice forming inside an iron ribcage. [32]
Power trained me to wait, to watch the heat leave, to recognize where potential hides when stilled. [49]
That is why I came here, to find where unused potential pools when the sky stops shouting. [66]
Bleak exhilaration is honest, and honesty is the only fuel I trust anymore. [79]
I am a drone strike wedding survivor, a name like a bruise that never quite fades. [95]
The blast left me with a geode crystal fused into my shoulder, a purple cathedral under skin. [112]
It throbs whenever the currents above and below argue, an intangibly tangible compass that points by ache. [129]
The doctors called it shrapnel and shrugged, but I call it an oracle that survived out of spite. [147]
The observatory drifts on silent fans over the ruined valley where the convoy once rolled. [162]
Below lies the road that carried the wedding procession, and above us moves the cold machine choir. [179]
I hunt patterns in their music the way I once hunted shade for grieving uncles. [194]
My job here is unofficial, the kind of title you whisper because you need it to exist. [211]
I am the night physicist, using perturbation theory like a lantern to disturb silence into confession. [227]
Small pushes reveal hidden terms, tiny nudges expose the slack that never meets the equation head on. [244]
Through perturbation theory I read the oscillations of cooling wires and uncoiling storms. [257]
A derivative hums in the rafters, and my shoulder hums back, a duet for the not yet born. [275]
I keep the geode crystal in a pocket when the ache grows, and I hold it to the glass. [294]
Light falls through it like rain through cathedral ruins, finding edges where edges were not. [309]
The facets teach me how to bend attention without breaking it, how to harvest the slack. [325]
The commander thinks I am gathering weather, but what I gather is the unspent will of the world. [343]
Unused potential pools in gutters of power, in the gaps between integers, in sighs caught below speech. [360]
I learned this during my unfiltered awakening, the long minute after the blast peeled my ears. [376]
Time arrived without blossom or gate, only raw arrival, and I saw the force that went unused. [393]
So I came to the fans and mirrors, to the hovering decks of this lonely instrument. [409]
I am here to hunt that force and learn its tides, even if it ferries grief aboard. [426]
Tonight the sky bruises green, and the circuit breakers cool slower, as if digesting bad news. [442]
I knock the panel with my knuckles, and the geode crystal answers with a soft interior bell. [459]
The charts twitch; the stairsteps of data blur; a basin appears where once there was a cliff. [476]
We drift three meters starboard to hover above it, the way hawks pin a rumor to earth. [493]
I run the sequence, perturb the current by a breath, and listen for the answer returning. [509]
The chamber fills with moth colored light, and my shoulder blazes a corridor straight into the valley. [526]
I taste the unresolved, warm copper on my tongue, and laughter tries to grow where sorrow sits. [543]
It is not joy, but something like breath after drowning, bleak exhilaration that refuses to pretend. [559]
Through the glass I see villages unspool their lights, then spool them again, as if knitting absence. [576]
Unused potential pools there, in corners where the grid never reaches, in neighbors never speaking, in hands unclasped. [594]
I mark the basin and send the coordinates to the commander with a note written like a dare. [612]
He will read that the energy is recoverable, that it waits like a shoreline under fog. [628]
He will not understand the price, the hush that must be kept for the pooling to continue. [645]
But I understand, because the pooling in me keeps my heart from burning up with the fans. [662]
I leave the console and press my shoulder to the glass, and the observatory tilts like a witness. [680]
In the valley the machines slow their circle, like beasts that smell rain they have never seen. [697]
While circuit breakers cool, I vow to remain awake, to keep the measure open and unclean. [713]
It is an unfiltered awakening each time, a window cracked in a locked house, a breath refusing orders. [731]
I am the bruise that reads the weather, the hunt that does not end in killing. [747]
My geode crystal warms, a small cathedral keeping vigil, and the world answers with a wounded hymn. [764]
We drift over the basin of unused might, and I swear I can feel it lift us. [781]
It is not mercy, not yet, but it is something intangibly tangible, a grip forming in the dark. [799]</story>
