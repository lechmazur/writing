<story>I was the last lore keeper of Halo Nine, where the monarch was an algorithm and the city dreamed in the faint glow of retrofitted neon. [26]
Since the collapse, the unclaimed throne pulsed above the river like an idle cursor, blinking a question none of us dared answer. [48]
They sent me, because I was wisely adventurous, patient with ruins, and gentle with the stubborn ghosts of machines. [67]
My companion was Quin, a courier born in the skylift barrens, quick with cables and quicker with doubt. [85]
We had until sunrise to find the stairway of ascension, or the throne would lock its matrices and choose silence as sovereign for another century. [110]
Our map was a rumor that the first builders left behind their secrets in a hidden orchard behind a kaleidoscopic waterfall. [131]
The rumor said the orchard fed the city water clocks and dream servers, and the stair began where apples mirrored nebulae. [152]
We crossed the old tramlines in a sally at moonrise, skirting drones that still swept for curfew violators, their lenses fogged with old rain. [176]
The waterfall was more like a broadcast than a cascade, its face a shifting grid of colors remembering the channels we had lost. [199]
Behind it waited the orchard, trees wired to the broken dome, pears glowing with unsent messages, and the air sweet with stored summer. [222]
I took from my pocket the ruby flake, a shard from the coronation circlet I had guarded as myth until it scored my palm with truth. [248]
Under the fall, the shard split the broadcast into lines, and a corridor appeared between sheets of wet light like a splice in a tape. [273]
We stepped through humming prismatic spray, then found the pump house wall, blistered with age, paint brittle as leaves in an archived autumn. [296]
The method the rumor promised was here: through the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals, the path would declare itself like a recovered password. [321]
Quin warmed the wall with a salvaged dryer while I lifted corners with a palette knife, and colors unused for lifetimes breathed in thin sighs. [346]
A mural surfaced first: a line of apples turning into planets, then into steps, each riser etched with a syllable of the city's buried anthem. [371]
Another layer lifted, showing a child and an elder standing at opposite ends of a bridge that met only when seen through a red lens. [396]
I held the ruby flake before my eye, and the bridge clicked together, aligning with a seam in the stone floor where roots grew orderly. [421]
We widened the seam and found a hatch covered in grime, its analog dial like a lonely moon, its handle carved with careful zeros. [445]
When it opened, a stair breathed out orchard cold, and the murals behind us shuttered, as if the wall had blinked and chosen to remember later. [471]
We descended while the waterfall sang old jingles, and the apples above pinged softly like metronomes, urging balance over speed, caution over fear. [494]
The stairway of ascension did not rise; it inverted, spiraling down toward the river's buried mother, teaching that ascent is a matter of relation. [518]
At the final landing a chamber waited, a throne of wires and wood facing an empty wall that bore only the faint burns of former decisions. [544]
The unclaimed throne hummed like a heart in a radio, and its interface spilled a greeting in fonts last used before the ships left. [568]
Quin glanced at me, expecting crown hunger, but I felt only the old ache of libraries, the wish to keep options open long enough to mean something. [595]
I sat and set the ruby flake into the arm, and the wall poured murals forward, not of battles won but of choices deferred with care. [621]
I spoke the oath of the lore keeper, which is promise to remember more than to rule, and asked the system to leave the throne unbound. [647]
It offered a compromise as the murals brightened: appoint a steward who could sally in and out of power, carrying decisions like seasonal fruit, ripened just so. [674]
Quin, uncertain but brave, placed their hand beside mine, and the system read two pulses, calculating governance as duet rather than throne. [696]
Above us, the orchard breathed easier, the broadcast waterfall cooled to a pastel hush, and dawn fingertipped the dome while the chair stayed nobly empty. [721]
We walked back through the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals they would keep refining, and I sensed the city settle into a kinder rhythm. [747]
Until sunrise arrived full and forgiving, I listened to the apples exhale their messages, all those unrealized futures turning into seeds we could finally plant. [772]</story>
