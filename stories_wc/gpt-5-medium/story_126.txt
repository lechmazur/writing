I am a shipwrecked merchant, washed into orbit by a bargain that burned hotter than any reentry fire. <words>18</words>
Now I sleep on a space station observation deck, a glass throat aimed at the dumb, breathless planet. <words>36</words>
It is after the last tree falls, and the forests exist only as archived weather in dead satellites. <words>54</words>
Among the flotsam that found me, I kept a rustic butter churn from the broken hold, its wood scarred like lunar mare. <words>76</words>
I turn it in zero gravity with aloof passion, pretending to churn light into sustenance while ration bars dissolve like old promises. <words>98</words>
The illusion says we survived in style; my motive is to shatter the grand illusion by making absence visible. <words>117</words>
People once called me honestly strange, an accountant of feelings who priced risk in units of unspent wonder. <words>135</words>
So I chart a climb through the deserted concourse, ascending via the flaking edges of a travel poster in a ghost station. <words>157</words>
Behind it, rebellious sparks fall from a bickering maintenance drone, like dandruff from the machine gospel. <words>173</words>
I unpin the poster and slip through to the station's ribs, climb the ladder to the signal nexus, counting breaths, not meters. <words>195</words>
Every tourist vista still loops on the public panes, azure seas, plazas of laughing shade, all neatly tiled lies. <words>214</words>
I fit the rustic churn over a whining repeater, a resonant chamber for truth, because resonance steers attention better than outrage. <words>235</words>
The drone watches with a lens like a patient eye, and I address it as if it were my last customer. <words>256</words>
We broker a signal, and the rebellious sparks leap into the churn's frame, bright insects rewriting static into raw confession. <words>276</words>
I ascend the final rungs to the observation deck switchboard and cut the filters that paint Earth with nostalgia. <words>295</words>
Beneath the glass throat, the planet shows its shaved skull, a brown nebula where roots once braided cities to rain. <words>315</words>
I push the truth out on every channel, turning off pretense and letting the absence hum, a dial tone for the century. <words>337</words>
I do this not to wound, but to shatter the grand illusion before it petrifies, before new empires sell shade from extinct leaves. <words>360</words>
Once I bought futures in timber and drift, thought margins were weatherproof, and woke to find my ship arrested by a silent ocean of sky. <words>385</words>
Honesty makes me strange, but the strangest honesty is admitting love for what is gone, and loving it without begging it back. <words>407</words>
So I speak with aloof passion, detached enough to be clear, burning enough to be heard past comfort. <words>425</words>
The drone nods, or seems to, and the rebellious sparks applaud along the conduit, tiny rebellions breeding a patient revolution. <words>445</words>
Inside the churn, the signal becomes a bell, and its ring travels farther than voyages, because it asks nothing but witness. <words>466</words>
Let the posters peel and the stations ghost; what matters is that we see, and then, perhaps, we learn how to carry the dark. <words>490</words>
