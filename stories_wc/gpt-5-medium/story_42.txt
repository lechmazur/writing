After the last song is sung, the wind turns the cliffside temple of swirling wind turbines into a breathing machine of sighs. <words>22</words>
I arrive again, a master forger with guilt issues, clutching a dried-up fountain pen with exotic nib like a relic. <words>42</words>
Resigned exuberance bubbles in me, a bright ache that knows the cost of accuracy and the relief of confession. <words>61</words>
I came to restore ancient knowledge, and every gust that slaps my coat feels like a reminder and a benediction. <words>81</words>
The ledger I found under the temple altar waits, loyally unique, its vellum bruised by centuries yet still expectant. <words>100</words>
My method is simple and dangerous, via overlays of personal notes within a found ledger, like whispering across eras. <words>119</words>
Each overlay softening barriers between dead scribes and my shame, each stroke an apology, each gap a citadel to breach. <words>139</words>
I was paid once to counterfeit their maps, to invent coastlines mothered by lies, and sailors died believing my patience. <words>159</words>
The temple forgave no one, but the turbines kept singing to the gulls, and I learned to listen while kneeling. <words>179</words>
Tonight the sky purples, and I start the skirmish with myself, inkless nib scratching phantom lines over the brittle script. <words>199</words>
Every scratch marks intent, an admission that forgery can also teach, translating the lost grammar of tide, wind, and star. <words>219</words>
They knew storms as courtiers, bowed to mathematics without worshiping it, and carried compasses of bone polished by longing. <words>238</words>
I layer my confession beside theirs, promising my hand will never lie again, though hands are born treacherous to boundaries. <words>258</words>
A gust slams the door, sand hisses across the floor, and my dried-up fountain pen with exotic nib finally drinks breath. <words>279</words>
One drop of resurrected ink blooms, like a pupil widening, as if the temple agreed to witness without absolving me. <words>299</words>
I write not to replace, but to reconcile, letting my marginalia ferry across chasms with ropes of doubt and care. <words>319</words>
Outside, the turbines spin like prayer wheels for atheists, their low hum plaiting resolve into grief until both are wearable. <words>339</words>
A memory breaks ranks, a skirmish within the larger war, showing me a girl who traced my forgery and vanished at sea. <words>361</words>
I place her name inside a compass rose, a secret letterhead for remorse, and map a safer passage the old masters implied. <words>383</words>
This ledger becomes a bridge where softening barriers teach me to carry the burden without disguising its cut or weight. <words>403</words>
Pages thicken with overlays, not to dominate but to companion, the way a tide walks beside a cliff and does not fall. <words>425</words>
When the night closes, I leave the ledger open to the wind, trusting its loyally unique patience to court the dawn. <words>446</words>
I descend the path lighter, not forgiven, but stitched to purpose, a counterfeit soul learning the art of honest restoration. <words>466</words>
