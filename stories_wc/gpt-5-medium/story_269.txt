<story>After the last code is broken, the steampunk observation deck shudders like a clock about to weep. <words>17</words>
A nostalgic tailor named Ivo smooths his frayed cuffs and listens to the engines whisper. <words>32</words>
Beside him a dusty mirror leans against a riveted pillar, reflecting steam like a patient ghost. <words>48</words>
In its fogged pane he sees parallel lives threading through his silhouette, hems of futures stitched over past mistakes. <words>67</words>
He aches, with hopeful desperation, to ascend beyond mortal limits, to tailor his fate as if fabric were sky. <words>86</words>
Yet the machinery murmurs in a subtly menacing timbre, promising altitude while grinding down the brave. <words>102</words>
Storms wander the clouds below, and during each one he reassures the crew via improbable confessions. <words>118</words>
He admits to sewing contraband maps into lapels, to deciphering love from torn tickets, to lying about where the last cipher began. <words>140</words>
These absurd truths reassure them because storms respect brazen honesty, and bolts step aside for exposed seams. <words>157</words>
Between gusts, the dusty mirror reveals another Ivo on another deck, needle suspended over a heart he dares not mend. <words>177</words>
Their parallel lives speak without moving lips, counting stitches that cross realities, tallying prices each choice will exact. <words>195</words>
After the last code is broken, no authority remains to forbid ascent, only the drag of memory and the ballast of fear. <words>217</words>
Ivo measures the wind with a tailor's tape, calculates lift against loss, and drafts a pattern for escape upon copper panels. <words>238</words>
The captain, whose smile is a subtly menacing crescent, asks what fabric can hold a man above his grief. <words>257</words>
Ivo confesses that he has stolen winds from his other self, and that he will stitch memories into a sail and fly. <words>279</words>
When the next storm arrives, he reassures them again via improbable confessions, confessing he once tailored thunder to fit a child's lullaby. <words>301</words>
The mirror-Ivo nods, and in that nod travels a pattern, a liturgy of seams, a consent to cut the fear away. <words>322</words>
Together they rig a frame of brass ribs, silk pockets, and hot breath, and the deck becomes an atelier of survival. <words>343</words>
Lightning scribbles subtly menacing letters across the clouds, but hopeful desperation inks steadier lines over their hearts. <words>360</words>
When they let go, the ship judders, the mirror flashes lives in chorus, and Ivo whispers to reassure the sky that he belongs. <words>383</words>
Above the coils of rain, past the broken codes of gravity, he stitches parallel waves of air until they carry him. <words>404</words>
His other self waves from the dusty mirror now clear as springwater, and both Ivones share one buoyant breath. <words>423</words>
Neither has ascended beyond mortal limits yet, but hopeful desperation gives them altitude enough to choose the next stitch. <words>442</words>
