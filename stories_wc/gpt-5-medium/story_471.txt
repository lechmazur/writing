I hunt ruins the way others chase storms, reckless in stride yet aching to understand how absence shapes the living. <words>20</words>
Tonight, when a forgotten promise resurfaces without warning, I enter the abandoned funfair lost in a misty forest. <words>38</words>
I once vowed to map ghost towns for the ones who could not return, and this map needs a fierce new edge. <words>60</words>
My hands are meticulously careless, cataloging debris with reckless flair, as if precision were a dare I keep accepting. <words>79</words>
From my satchel I lift a vintage camera lens, heavy as a cathedral door, polished by years of wandering pockets. <words>99</words>
Through it, the midway stalls align like vertebrae, and the prize shelves hold taxidermied shadows waiting to be named. <words>118</words>
I learned wise choices through conversations with street musicians who traded chords for maps, and maps for confessions under rain-slick bridges. <words>139</words>
They taught me to listen first, then choose, so I arrive bold yet vulnerable, a bowstring pulled but waiting for breath. <words>160</words>
In the tilt-a-whirl car I find a crumpled postcard addressed to me, a promise I wrote and never mailed. <words>179</words>
It says I would hand-deliver a map to a child who feared the dark, and my throat fills with moths. <words>199</words>
I atomize the lie that time forgives, crushing it to powder with my boot, and let the wind taste my resolve. <words>220</words>
The funhouse mirrors whistle, mist curling like careful script, and I move room to room, plotting coordinates with spooled string and chalk. <words>242</words>
Wise choices do not feel safe; they feel exact, like sliding a blade between bone and stubborn memory. <words>260</words>
I photograph each stall through the lens, then flip the glass and study the world backward, where lost things sometimes step forward. <words>282</words>
There, I glimpse the child I promised, sitting on a carousel lion, waiting for the map with a patient, impossible smile. <words>303</words>
I speak the route aloud the way a busker strikes an opening chord, offering a path rather than a performance. <words>323</words>
The trees lean in like listeners, and the midway lights flicker, as if voltage were a rumor returning from a difficult exile. <words>345</words>
I chart the exits, the sinkholes, the wild ivy that eats fences, careful enough to be true, careless enough to discover. <words>366</words>
When the map is complete, I tuck the postcard beneath the ferris wheel seat, a waypoint for any heart that doubts. <words>387</words>
Leaving, I thank the unseen musicians who tuned my courage, and promise to listen again wherever pavements sing and forests refuse to swallow names. <words>411</words>
I remain a reckless hunter, but I choose with care what to chase, because some ghosts guide maps and others just hunger. <words>433</words>
