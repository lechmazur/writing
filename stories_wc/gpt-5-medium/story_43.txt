After the last human story is written, I enter the neon cathedral like a rumor that refuses to quiet. <words>19</words>
I am a wary explorer, loudly introverted, a paradox that clicks against my ribs like a moth in a lantern. <words>39</words>
I meander along aisles of humming glass, altars sparking with shattered pixels that mimic stained light and remember forgotten hymns. <words>59</words>
I came to spark an unexpected reunion with my own courage, and I carried emblems of courage to tempt it home. <words>80</words>
In my pocket rests a damaged music cd, scuffed into a crescent, its songs skipping like hearts that fear their next beat. <words>102</words>
I navigate by tracing the flicker of fireflies under a thick fog the generators exhale, their green lanterns stitching a wavering path. <words>124</words>
Every step rings through the cathedral like a copper bell, and yet I want nobody to hear me arrive or leave. <words>145</words>
Being loudly introverted means my silence protests at full volume, the quietest shout in a city that no longer listens. <words>165</words>
In the apse, a hologram loops the last library index, blinking names of books like saints who await a pilgrim late to vespers. <words>188</words>
My hands shake, not from fear of ghosts, but from the tremor of deciding whether my courage still recognizes my face. <words>209</words>
I slip the cd onto a cracked altar tray, feed power to a relic player, and wait for the wounded music to begin. <words>232</words>
When it stutters, the fireflies answer, their flicker syncing to the broken beat like tiny metronomes shaking dust from history. <words>252</words>
I realize the emblems of courage were never medals or banners, but these humble flashes that refuse to stop, despite the fog. <words>274</words>
They stitch memories into my clothes, recalling nights I chose hard roads, mornings I spoke truth, and afternoons I stayed when leaving looked easy. <words>298</words>
The cathedral answers with a ripple of neon, a crooked hope bending through the ribs of the place, making space to breathe. <words>320</words>
I talk to the empty pews, loudly, like a thunderstorm confessing, and the echo is a compass pointing at my own unsettled heart. <words>343</words>
So I meander again, this time with intention, by tracing the flicker of fireflies under a thick fog toward the highest nave. <words>365</words>
There a mirror waits, silver bruised, catching neon like rain, and my reflection arrives late, carrying every road I refused until now. <words>387</words>
I press the damaged disc to the glass and hear a chord smooth itself, as if forgiveness were a needle finding the groove. <words>410</words>
Courage steps from the mirror, wary as me, yet grinning like a stormbreak, and we bow, reunited, before the neon cathedral's patient altars. <words>433</words>
It pins no badge but offers those firefly emblems of courage, lights stitched to a path, a lamp I can carry into darkness. <words>456</words>
After the last echo, I step outside, not braver than before, just finally beside myself, walking in stride with that crooked hope. <words>478</words>
