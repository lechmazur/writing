I tend the abandoned carnival ticket booth after the rides fled, a gloomy barkeep without bottles, serving memories in paper cups to no one. <words>24</words>
Customers still arrive as shadows, abrasively charming in their refusal to vanish, barging through the slit window with breath like coins left in rain. <words>48</words>
They ask for change, and I give them time, because that is the only currency I carry between these transient realities. <words>69</words>
Tonight the air vibrates at the hush when a truce forms without words, the midway lights dead yet listening. <words>88</words>
I was told stories drone from broken machines, but here the drone comes from my throat, a bar rag wringing sound instead of suds. <words>112</words>
It keeps the ghosts honest, or at least punctual, and it keeps me fixed on the simple vow to reclaim the light stolen by midnight. <words>137</words>
My worn wallet sits like a small mausoleum under the cash drawer, stuffed with notes that are not money but maps of impossible exits. <words>161</words>
Each map was drawn via overheard confessions at a broken payphone booth two tents down, where voices spill secrets because the dial refuses to. <words>185</words>
I keep the booth window open to those murmurs, and when the wind tilts right, names scratch the glass like sparks that forgot the flame. <words>210</words>
From them I built a recipe for peace, bitter and sweet, measured in the length of silences between syllables, served neat with an enigmatic familiarity. <words>235</words>
It works only when I do not advertise it, when I lean on the counter and let my voice drone like an old calliope after the parade. <words>262</words>
Then the shadows stop bargaining and simply listen, and I can separate their hungers from my own without cutting either. <words>282</words>
A woman in a coat of ticket stubs arrives, her smile abrasively charming, as if daring me to refuse the change she never paid for. <words>307</words>
She slides a photograph into my palm, and the face on it is mine, younger, brighter, a bartender under noon, a lighthouse that never learned storm. <words>333</words>
You left this behind, she says, and I open the worn wallet to find the same photograph, split like a card prepared for a trick. <words>358</words>
Between the halves is a note from the booth with the broken phone, a confession that midnight is a thief I once hired as doorman. <words>383</words>
I read it aloud, and the calliope pipes in the dark begin to drone again, but softer, as if tuning themselves toward dawn. <words>406</words>
The woman becomes less shadow and more weather, and she asks for a drink I do not pour, so I serve her attention instead. <words>430</words>
That is when the truce I promised the night keeps itself, and the light I chased returns like a bar tab finally paid by morning. <words>455</words>
I push the slit window wider, and together we watch the midway breathe, not alive, not dead, but paused, a reality between tides. <words>478</words>
