Amid the hum of server rooms, a cheerless duelist drifted into the abandoned spaceport customs office, hauling a maggoty wooden chest that rattles. <words>23</words>
He had come not for contraband, but to learn the power of forgiveness before his scars hardened into law. <words>42</words>
The station, like him, logged everything except its own fatal flaws, and the logs still blinked patiently behind dust filmed glass. <words>63</words>
He set the chest on the counter where passports once stamped, and it rattled like a conscience waking under bureaucratic frost. <words>84</words>
He had dueled across colonies with a blade built to refuse fatalities, yet people still fell, and rumor called him merciless anyway. <words>106</words>
Inside the chest were heirloom cookbooks from a family he had wounded, pages rewritten through unexpected mutations of family recipes into instructions for survival. <words>130</words>
He was precisely innovative with steel, yet clumsy with kindness, and the books throbbed with a generosity he feared he could not mimic. <words>153</words>
The servers hummed like an arena crowd, and he remembered the duel that turned vicious when his opponent slipped on spilled spiced broth. <words>176</words>
He had tried to elasticize the moment, to pull time wide and spare the man, but their fatal flaws snapped it back. <words>198</words>
A note nestled between marinade charts, written by the sister of the fallen, invited him to cook, to listen, to be changed. <words>220</words>
The customs breakroom still had a stove, stained and stubborn, and he fired it with contraband fuel while the chest kept rattling. <words>242</words>
The recipes were astronauted for low gravity, telling him to elasticize dough with vacuum pulls, to knead by orbit, to temper by star charts. <words>266</words>
Amid the hum of server rooms, aromas rose like truces; anise, citrus, pepper, and the metallic hint of regret evaporating off his skin. <words>289</words>
He spoke to the empty booths as if they held jurors, telling the man he failed that mercy must be practiced, not postponed. <words>312</words>
A voice crackled from an old manifest terminal, the sister listening on a tapped line, saying forgiveness was an apprenticeship measured in burned pans. <words>336</words>
He plated the meal, tasted its warmth, and placed a second portion into the chest, where the maggots had become moths of paperwork. <words>359</words>
His duelist hands, precisely innovative in violence, learned a softer angle, measuring heat like distance, admitting the count of every slight he had scored. <words>383</words>
He promised the sister a meeting at dawn, where the runway lights still worked, and she promised to carry a spoon instead of a knife. <words>408</words>
They would confront their fatal flaws like customs forms, declaring losses, paying duty, and letting some items pass unsearched for the sake of tomorrow. <words>432</words>
When he closed the office, the servers kept humming and the chest rattled once, a bittersweet reckoning that sounded almost, impossibly, like yes. <words>455</words>
