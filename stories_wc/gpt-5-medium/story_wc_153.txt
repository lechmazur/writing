<story>I pole the skiff into the mangrove labyrinth inhabited by singing spirits, and their choruses ache me awake. [18]
They sound like rain learning a language, like throats full of unsent letters clearing themselves without ever breaking. [36]
I am a cryptic medium, which is another way of saying my answers arrive sideways and hum. [53]
Mara sent me here, without sending, from the room we still share with unmet words and turned faces. [71]
I came to find the moment before deciding, the hinge of breath where a door could wait. [88]
Because I failed the kindness of that hinge once, and I am not finished failing safely. [104]
In my pocket rattles a gargoyle's rainspout shard, salt-sanded, torn from the cathedral roof we sheltered under. [121]
It remembers storms better than I do, and I carry it as a vow I cannot pronounce. [138]
My left palm is scarred from gripping its edge, a crescent that heals in moonlight and reopens at dawn. [157]
It keeps time on me, like the tide keeping time on the shore it longs to leave. [174]
I tie the shard to a cord, a pendant that clicks against the skiff's lantern as I move. [192]
When the lantern fogs, messages in condensation on windows begin writing their slow, patient syllables across the glass. [210]
I do not steer by stars here, but by those wet letters spelling the paths I cannot read aloud. [229]
The spirits sing to evoke each glimmering phrase, and the mangroves lean in like gossiping elders. [245]
They know I have come in the space where an apology waits unspoken, where time folds into possibility. [263]
A heron watches from a knotted root, bright as a comma, insisting the sentence can still pivot. [280]
The first voice that finds me is not Mara's, but the voice of a soaked stair at midnight. [298]
It sings of ankles that almost turned back, and of laughter that split the rain into ribbons of warmth. [317]
I anchor the skiff beside a blackwater mirror, and let the shard dangle like a plumbline into remembering. [335]
Bring me that hour, I ask, fierce tenderness cracking my ribs like kindling trying to become fire. [352]
The water replies by lifting a slick page, and the lantern glass writes a name my mouth avoids. [370]
Mara appears in the reflection not as a face, but as the moment her shoulder paused near the door. [389]
I remember the gargoyle's mouth roaring rain then, and how my hand opened, and how the shard chose me. [408]
I had wanted to leave before I said something cruel, and that wanting became my only compass. [425]
But she was reaching for me, not to hold, only to ask that I slow my breathing with hers. [444]
I missed it; the hinge sighed shut; and the cathedral gave us its tooth against my palm for later. [463]
Here, the spirits bend their throats around that syllable of almost, tuning the mangroves into cathedral ribs. [480]
They ask what I seek, and I tell them I want the moment before deciding, unbruised and clear. [498]
Not to change, I say, but to witness honestly, and to carry that witness back to her. [515]
The glass inhales, fog blooms, and messages in condensation on windows thread a sentence I cannot pretend away. [533]
It says: let your wanting be small enough to hear her wanting, and let silence not be armor. [551]
I hold the shard to the lantern, and the droplet words fracture into a halo of near-answers. [568]
I think of the letters I never sent Mara, their drafts sleeping like minnows around a hookless memory. [586]
I will not mail them, but I will speak them, here, then carry the speaking as proof of breath. [605]
Mara, I say, your pause was a harbor, and I ran like a storm thinking I was saving us. [624]
I was only saving my fear from hearing your ask, and I am ashamed of that tenderness hoarded. [642]
The grove hums around me, fierce tenderness threading every note as if the roots are learning forgiveness. [659]
I ask the spirits to return me to the boat's first quiver, before the cathedral split our patience. [677]
They cannot move the world, they croon, but they can teach my hands to stop leaving before they answer. [696]
So I practice on water, answering ripples with stillness, letting the shard's edge lie quiet upon my skin. [714]
The moon lifts, and my wound closes by degrees, a small white door learning how to stay open. [732]
I understand healing is not reversal, only a readable surface where new sentences can risk arriving. [748]
When I turn back through the mangrove labyrinth inhabited by singing spirits, the path feels like a listening. [766]
I will go home and not decide, not yet; I will share the hinge and let it breathe us. [785]</story>
