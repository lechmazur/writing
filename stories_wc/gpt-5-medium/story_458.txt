Night had thinned when my flying library drifted over the abandoned spaceport baggage claim. <words>14</words>
I am its pilot and its last librarian, spiritually secular and stubbornly faithful to memory. <words>29</words>
Here, conveyors squeal with ghosts, and numbered carousels circle like slow planets with no luggage. <words>44</words>
I moor the library beside Claim Six and brew coffee on a cracked security console. <words>59</words>
The groundswell of caffeine is my oracle, the steam my breath, the stains my constellations. <words>74</words>
I read the future in coffee stains, because ink has learned to lie like politicians. <words>89</words>
A detached coat button rolls from beneath a bench, ticking a small rhythm against metal ribs. <words>105</words>
I pocket it, a relic from someone who left without closure, a period pulled from life. <words>121</words>
The button will be my anchor if the omens want to carry me into storm. <words>136</words>
I am searching for the bridge to unity, a literal span the elders once described. <words>151</words>
They said it migrates like a whale, whispering between worlds, letting languages braid without strangling. <words>166</words>
This is why the library flies: to preserve a fading tradition of books crossing distances. <words>181</words>
Without the bridge, fashion will obliterate wisdom, and everyone will dress their ignorance in mirrors. <words>196</words>
Fractal sorrow scribbles the air, repeating losses inside losses, yet the baggage claim hums patiently. <words>211</words>
A siren of static rises from the tannoy, announcing flights that never existed and still boarding. <words>227</words>
I pour the coffee across a manifest, and brown galaxies bloom inside the captured light. <words>242</words>
I tilt the page until a corridor appears, a stain-bridge drawn between Gate C and silence. <words>258</words>
In the second a simple yes or no can change everything, the tannoy falls utterly quiet. <words>274</words>
Yes means I trust the stains, and no means my doubt will calcify into another museum. <words>290</words>
The button in my pocket warms, as if touched by a distant coat still needing fastening. <words>306</words>
I say yes, because preserving a tradition requires risk, not just cataloging the safe and known. <words>322</words>
The stains ripple; a door shivers open where carousel numbers flicker, and Claim Six becomes throat. <words>338</words>
I fly the library through, shelves strapped like wings, pages rustling like migrants clutching lullabies. <words>353</words>
Beyond, the bridge to unity is not marble but listening, an architecture of consent spanning star-wounds. <words>369</words>
The elders greet me without faces, speaking from the pressure of gravity and the hush of readers. <words>386</words>
They ask for the button, the period, to punctuate a treaty between islands of broken grammar. <words>402</words>
I surrender it, and the lost coat wraps the bridge, fastening winds so stories can cross. <words>418</words>
In exchange, they stitch a new path into my atlas, a route only kindness can navigate. <words>434</words>
When we return, the baggage claim is lighter, its ghosts filing claims that finally resolve to presence. <words>451</words>
I swivel the tannoy to broadcast not departures but invitations: bring your fragments and borrow wholeness. <words>467</words>
Somewhere, fashion still tries to obliterate wisdom, but here, ash becomes soil, and pages become bridges. <words>483</words>
I pilot on, spiritually secular as ever, keeping faith with doubt and with the listening road ahead. <words>500</words>
