At the second a handshake seals a hidden deal, thunder crowds the courtyards of the ancient indian temple. <words>18</words>
I, once a city planner turned doomsday prepper, wait beneath eroded frescoes with daring caution coiling tighter than prayer flags. <words>38</words>
I have come to banish doubt with unyielding will, though my confidence arrives disguised and rarely authentic. <words>55</words>
In my pack rests an antique ink blotter, lacquer scarred, velvet worn smooth by generations of trembling signatures. <words>73</words>
It once soaked the excess of city plans I drafted, swallowing rivers of certainty that later swallowed neighborhoods. <words>91</words>
Now I navigate by studying broken constellations, shards of myth that map the only exits from catastrophe and from myself. <words>111</words>
The stars teach me escaping self-imposed chains begins with admitting I forged them while tracing boulevards over breathing streets. <words>130</words>
Across from me, the broker priest smooths his robe, waiting to take my palm and convert a private dread into coin. <words>151</words>
He wants the caches of blueprints I hid in catacomb chambers I surveyed under the city, maps I swore I would protect. <words>173</words>
At the second a handshake seals a hidden deal, the monsoon surges and torches hiss like serpents awakened to judge us. <words>194</words>
I feel the urge to debase my calling, to sell the living skeleton of a city to fund another bunker. <words>214</words>
But the antique ink blotter presses on my spine, a small weight remembering every oath it once drank and kept. <words>234</words>
Above the sanctum roof, broken constellations fracture again as clouds shear, arranging themselves into a cartography of refusal. <words>252</words>
I pull back, fingers loosening, feeling the mask that is rarely authentic slide, and the chains clatter where my wrist had met his. <words>275</words>
The broker priest narrows his eyes, but the temple carvings behind him show planners bowing to floods, and then standing taller. <words>296</words>
I tell him that to banish doubt with unyielding will I must stop laying roads for fear to march upon. <words>316</words>
Instead I offer the antique ink blotter as pledge, and a plan to reroute water toward the temple fields before nightfall. <words>337</words>
By studying broken constellations and their mirrored cracks in the flooded courtyard, I can calibrate sluices cut by chisel and rope. <words>358</words>
With daring caution we haul stone, I draw lines with charcoal on thresholds, and villagers move like careful thunder within the nave. <words>380</words>
The broker priest releases the deal, joining the work, while my old skills return without swagger, firm, hard earned, and usefully silent. <words>402</words>
As the water finds the channels we cut, I feel the first link of self-imposed chains dissolve into silt and starlight. <words>423</words>
When dawn arrives, the only handshake is between river and field, and I accept that survival without integrity is a ruined city. <words>445</words>
