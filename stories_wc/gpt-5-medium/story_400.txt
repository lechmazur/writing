<story>The glacial orchard suspended over a crevasse of blue ice was my post, and I tended it alone.<words>18</words>
This was after the last human set foot on Earth, a hush so complete it bruised.<words>34</words>
They used to call me a guarded druid, which I accepted with dour amusement.<words>48</words>
Guarded meant I hid in work and bark, stitching wounds in bark with a dull safety pin.<words>65</words>
Druid meant the trees tolerated me, and sometimes they whispered when the wind rehearsed them.<words>80</words>
But no whisper could break the silence that had settled into the ice like calcified breath.<words>96</words>
I was fiercely ambivalent about changing it, a guardian who feared noise the way cliffs fear cracks.<words>113</words>
Yet my motive was simple enough: to overcome a crippling fear of proximity to my own memories.<words>130</words>
So I set the orchard to gather its fruits into nets of woven frost, as the old rites prescribed.<words>149</words>
From those pale globes I would prepare a special family meal prepared only on birthdays, though mine were long abandoned.<words>169</words>
The recipe demanded the fruit be peeled with patience, simmered with melted snow, and served beside a cup of quiet.<words>189</words>
My mother used to tap the cup and say, breaking the silence is the salt of celebration.<words>206</words>
I had never believed her until everyone left, and the tap would have to be mine.<words>222</words>
When the meal was ready, I carried the bowl across a rope bridge glazed with rime and doubt.<words>240</words>
Below, the blue ice opened its throat like a cathedral organ refusing to play for lack of hands.<words>258</words>
I arranged stones where chairs had been, and set the dull safety pin beside a wooden spoon as a reliquary.<words>278</words>
The pin had closed my cloak through three winters of storms, and deserved a seat at the table.<words>296</words>
I raised the cup of quiet, feeling its weight like unfinished words waiting for a throat to trust.<words>314</words>
Speak, I told myself, not to shatter the world, but to test whether it still bends.<words>330</words>
My voice crawled out, brittle and small, yet it crossed the crevasse and returned bearing echoes like bruised doves.<words>349</words>
The orchard answered with a rustle that might have been applause, or wind, or the old gods snacking.<words>367</words>
I tasted the birthday meal, and the sweetness was estranged, the way kin seem strange after years apart.<words>385</words>
Dour amusement tugged my mouth as I toasted the empty chairs and called them by name.<words>401</words>
Fear lifted its hood, hissed, and then settled like a tame stoat under my sleeve.<words>416</words>
I understood that breaking the silence is not a shout, but a meal shared with absences brave enough to attend.<words>436</words>
The orchard leaned closer on its cables, and the crevasse closed a breath, consenting to hold us.<words>453</words>
I would keep gathering, keep cooking birthdays for the unreturning, until speech felt less like glass in the mouth.<words>472</words>
Only then, perhaps, would the guarded druid be ready to hear the trees without confusing them for ghosts.<words>490</words></story>
