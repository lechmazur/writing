By habit I feel nothing quickly, yet I hurry, a weathered forager entering the giant's shoe with apathetic eagerness to begin mapping. <words>22</words>
The shoe's blistered insole spreads like a valley, and its sour air keeps me sensibly eccentric, alert to clues others dismiss as odor. <words>45</words>
My motive is plain enough to the soil, and faint to people: to study soil patterns that the urgings of the soul insist upon. <words>69</words>
I take my instructions through fragmented radio frequencies, catching crackled syllables that pass for method and comfort whenever the shoe groans. <words>90</words>
At my belt hangs a circus ringmaster's whip, not for punishment, but as a measuring line, a pointer, a mnemonic of cadence. <words>112</words>
Throughout harvesting, the leather valleys collect husks and dust, and I sift them, watching grain chaff align like constellations scattered across a patient sky. <words>136</words>
Along the creases I find strata of drudgework and rain, and I try to bring order to crumbs drifted by careless storms. <words>158</words>
The laces span the mouth like ridgelines, so I swing the whip to trace arcs, mapping where pressure once pressed down in a weary gait. <words>183</words>
When the radio stutters I translate the static, sampling intervals, folding the fragments into grids that make the leather's weird geography legible. <words>205</words>
The village calls me odd but dependable, the sensibly eccentric who knows where spilled millet accumulates and where damp rots seedlings into lace. <words>228</words>
Today I give an order to two apprentices, my face bored, my stride brisk, because the shoe's heel is whispering with capillary secrets. <words>251</words>
We plant orange flags across the mildew plain and gather cores, promising to stay throughout harvesting, no matter how the giant wanders. <words>273</words>
Sometimes I feel the urgings of the soul like a tired drum, and sometimes I hear nothing, and either way I continue. <words>295</words>
My ringmaster friend once taught me rhythm in an alley, then vanished into smoke, leaving the whip and a warning to count footsteps like beats. <words>320</words>
So I count, and the radio clicks in sympathy, reporting barometric changes, hinting the owner might return to try the shoe after storms. <words>343</words>
Even when the sole quakes and rivets creak like teeth, I collect samples, label them, and shuffle my bored eagerness into efficient paths. <words>366</words>
With the whip I lay transects, its leather tick marking boundaries, and the shoe answers, exhaling tannin and damp loam into our mouths. <words>389</words>
Through fragmented radio frequencies a distant agronomist praises the maps, approves our sensibly eccentric protocol, and grants us a provisional order to continue. <words>412</words>
I feel apathetic eagerness to file the report, knowing few read it, while the harvesters rely on the quiet clarity of my lines. <words>435</words>
At dusk I watch the laces turn horizons, and I obey the urgings of the soul, studying soil patterns throughout harvesting inside the giant's shoe. <words>460</words>
