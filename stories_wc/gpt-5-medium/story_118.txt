<story>I arrive at the secret agent training facility with merry bitterness stitched into my smile. <words>15</words>
Through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery, even the floodlights sound tired. <words>31</words>
I am the hive-mind therapist assigned to teach agents how to listen together, which is uniformly peculiar work. <words>49</words>
They come to me buzzing with secrets that drain them of sleep yet refuse to form a chorus. <words>67</words>
Tonight the Director hands me a scuffed phone charger plug recovered from a compromised locker. <words>82</words>
Its dents echo the sound of hindsight when I tap it against the metal tabletop. <words>97</words>
Hindsight has a rattle like loose pearls in a tin, regret flirting with instruction. <words>111</words>
The agents sit in a ring, their breaths synchronized by years of drills designed to make individuality negotiable. <words>129</words>
We practice hearing patterns arrive through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes on a mirror. <words>147</words>
Each droplet plinks like a tiny ellipsis, and together we complete the sentence it refuses to finish. <words>164</words>
The charger becomes our metronome, a scuffed comet whose orbit measures our patience while we wait for meaning. <words>182</words>
I ask the room what we want most, and their answer threads through me like a live wire. <words>200</words>
We want to anchor the ephemeral in reality before it mutates into catastrophe, they whisper in one voice. <words>218</words>
Bitterness laughs, merrily, because anchoring is simply another word for love that refuses to leave. <words>233</words>
The dripping slows, the coded shapes harden, and the hive gathers the pattern like bees fielding dusk. <words>250</words>
It tells of a mole who learned to counterfeit footsteps by playing recordings of hallway echoes backward. <words>267</words>
The charger, scratched by years of pockets, matches the static-scar of those tapes, an acoustic fingerprint made clumsy. <words>285</words>
We hear it together, the sound of hindsight arriving on schedule, asking us to forgive tomorrow in advance. <words>303</words>
So we draft a rejoinder in wax, a lullaby of false corridors, and feed it to the ventilation shafts. <words>322</words>
Through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery, our message migrates like warmth seeking a sleeper. <words>341</words>
The mole bites, following echoes into a room that does not exist, where only our candles breathe. <words>358</words>
We surround the emptiness, a uniformly peculiar chorus, and the floor panels click like teeth accepting confession. <words>375</words>
When they reveal themselves, I speak with every voice at once and offer a trade: memory for mercy. <words>393</words>
They accept, because hindsight roars loudest when given a listener shaped like many. <words>406</words>
We drain the room of threat, collect the charger, and hum, almost happy. <words>419</words>
Morning finds us tired yet laughing, our merry bitterness polished to a principle: secrecy heals when it finally sings. <words>438</words>
