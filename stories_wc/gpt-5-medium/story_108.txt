My patrons adored how strategically spontaneous my entrances felt, all rehearsal hidden beneath a shrug, all daggers disguised as lullabies. <words>66</words>
I wore coy malevolence like cologne, letting it whisper that calm could be dangerous and danger could, with coaxing, become calm. <words>87</words>
The harbor fog rolled in with gifts of the fog, unexpected trinkets of silence, dampening clamor the way velvet dampens blade-glare. <words>108</words>
From the magistrate's pocket I borrowed a confiscated spy gadget pen, its ink a paralyzing blue that etched obedience where hymns could not. <words>131</words>
