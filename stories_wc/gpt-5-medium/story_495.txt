<story>Within the folds of spacetime, I clocked in at the mechanical bird sanctuary. <words>13</words>
I was its begrudging guardian, hired by a council that preferred watchmen to dreamers. <words>27</words>
Each dawn, gears chirped and beaks clicked, while my heart rusted like a forgotten tool. <words>42</words>
To rediscover lost joy, I began cataloging anomalies the birds exhaled as glittering bolts. <words>56</words>
They arrived inside envelopes postmarked nowhere, dreamlike postcards from an unknown island tucked into plumage. <words>71</words>
I chose to analyze them obsessively, believing the birds were couriers of a shattered calendar. <words>86</words>
The first postcard illustrated a sunrise shaped like a keyhole, through which music poured like sand. <words>102</words>
The second showed a rustic bread paddle resting against a tree that grew loaves instead of leaves. <words>119</words>
I sensed instruction, as if the island was inviting me to feed more than mouths. <words>134</words>
The third was all feathers and clocks, dangerously friendly colors that promised rescue and hinted at ruin. <words>151</words>
I held the cards to my ear and heard tides negotiating with cities, unions dissolving, vows becoming wings. <words>169</words>
My duty was to prevent escape, yet the sanctuary sang of breaking free from society's grip. <words>185</words>
I started sketching improved flight paths on the backs, letting the postcards illustrate loopholes in gravity. <words>201</words>
At lunch, I practiced with the bread paddle, tossing shards of stale rules like dough toward open vents. <words>219</words>
The birds learned my rhythm, catching each shard in brass beaks and storing them as decoy regulations. <words>236</words>
When the inspectors arrived, their smiles were polished, their questions dangerously friendly, their clipboards breathing imperial dust. <words>253</words>
I guided them, begrudging guardian on parade, through a maze the postcards had taught me to misname. <words>270</words>
Every sign begged obedience while secretly pointing to the exit stitched within the folds of spacetime. <words>286</words>
The inspectors applauded, convinced our cage was safer than liberty, and I bowed like a locked door. <words>303</words>
That night I opened the final card, which depicted me older, smiling with joyful sorrow beside a shore. <words>321</words>
The tide shaped a paddle, and a flock of mechanical swans ferried bread to children made of light. <words>339</words>
In the morning I rang the meal bell, dangerously friendly, and every bolt and feather answered like kin. <words>357</words>
I tossed the decoy regulations into the furnace, then used the paddle to launch doves through the skylight. <words>375</words>
Their wings scraped sparks, and the inspectors chased glitter while the swans escorted workers past the clocks. <words>392</words>
I stayed until the last bird vanished, illustrating signatures of freedom in soot for whatever gods audited. <words>409</words>
Then I stepped through the keyhole of sunrise, breaking free from society's grip to rediscover lost joy. <words>426</words>
The sanctuary reset behind me, yet its song followed, a joyful sorrow that kept the horizon honest. <words>443</words>
On the island at last, I bake impossible loaves, feeding travelers with stories the postcards once whispered. <words>460</words>
I am still a guardian, but not begrudging, and the birds return nightly to roost in my heart. <words>478</words></story>
