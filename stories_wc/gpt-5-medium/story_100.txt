I arrived at the enchanted orchard policed by living statues, wearing dour amusement like armor against the night. <words>18</words>
A vivid dreamer by constitution, I was nonetheless awake, and that paradox tasted of iron apples. <words>34</words>
I had come to unravel the ultimate cosmic deception, a task both scientific and blasphemously intimate. <words>50</words>
The orchard's patient guardian waited where moonlight pooled, an androgynous statue whose gaze could oscillate between mercy and metric. <words>69</words>
Its granite pupils tracked me with rationally mischievous interest, as though calculating jokes to balance a ledger of sins. <words>88</words>
I offered my pressed penny collection, each oval copper face bearing the imprinted ghosts of cities where truths cracked. <words>107</words>
The guardian tilted, listening to the soft clatter, as though the flattened currency were oracles with careful tongues. <words>125</words>
I said I sought passage by following moon paths that threaded between brambles, mirroring secret routes in my dreams. <words>144</words>
The statue's mouth did not open, yet the orchard replied, leaves chafing like the crowd inside a courtroom. <words>162</words>
It judged me at the threshold of an apology yet to be spoken, demanding I account for my curiosities. <words>181</words>
So I answered with dour amusement, explaining that curiosity is grief's prank, and I was dutifully pranked. <words>198</words>
Once nightly, my thoughts oscillate like pendulums, seeking the fulcrum where nightmare and theorem both agree to tremble. <words>216</words>
I dream an orchard keeper kneeling beside a broken star, pressing its light flat the way pennies are pressed. <words>235</words>
In the morning, I find another elongated coin in my pocket, stamped with coordinates none of my maps admit. <words>254</words>
Those coordinates led me here, where the living statues police not bodies, but hypotheses, pruning speculation like windfall. <words>272</words>
I asked permission to test a hunch that the moon paths, when charted, spell the apology the cosmos withholds. <words>291</words>
The patient guardian raised one mossy hand, and the statues circled, forming a theorem of stone around my haste. <words>310</words>
Time thickened like sap, and my voice learned to move carefully, syllables weighed as if by forgotten taxes. <words>328</words>
I began laying pennies along the moon paths, each copper oval a vowel, spelling contrition for an absent maker. <words>347</words>
The orchard accepted the syntax, trees leaning like scribes, and the ground brightened with phrases none could read aloud. <words>366</words>
Then the patient guardian spoke by silence, and I understood its charge: protect repentance from premature performance. <words>383</words>
A rationally mischievous thought visited me, asking whether protection itself might be the grandest mask of deceit. <words>400</words>
I answered the thought by following moon paths once more, until they converged into a doorway shaped like patience. <words>419</words>
There I waited at the threshold of an apology yet to be spoken, smiling dour amusement, and guarding myself. <words>438</words>
