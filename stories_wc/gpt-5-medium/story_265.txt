<story>On maintenance days, I park beneath the nave where a lush orchard spanning the rafters of an abandoned cathedral hums like a heart. <words>23</words>
During oil changes, the chandeliers drip pears and the font keeps spare gaskets and a rag I will need. <words>42</words>
I am the impassive deputy assigned to mind the county fleet and whatever the sanctuary grows in the eaves. <words>61</words>
My manner is personally impersonal, a steadiness people trust the way vines trust a trellis. <words>76</words>
I climb the service ladder, stretch across pew shadows, and speak with the secret language of bees I learned from a retired apiarist chaplain. <words>100</words>
In my pocket rides a twisted twist tie, salvaged from a parts box, bent into a sigil the bees recognize. <words>120</words>
They answer in uncharted echoes, wing music that threads through organ pipes and stirs the dust into constellations. <words>138</words>
I come not to pray, but to witness a moment of pure grace before the oil warms and the engines wake. <words>159</words>
Today the orchard is wilder, a green choir climbing higher, fruit glassing the light where saints once stared outward. <words>178</words>
The hives tremble, and a sound like velvet torn slowly means a queen has fallen into the baptismal basin. <words>197</words>
Cautious bravery moves me, the kind that keeps the torque wrench steady while storms argue outside the bay doors. <words>216</words>
I lower the twisted twist tie like a lifeline, signal patience, and the queen climbs its wire as if ascending a staircase of breath. <words>240</words>
I murmur with the secret language of bees, a low chord that tells her attendants to hold, to part, to spiral gently. <words>262</words>
The cathedral keeps their uncharted echoes, and I listen like a metronome, counting calm while the air reframes itself around duty. <words>283</words>
She reaches the ledge, and the hive parts to receive her, a living chalice that makes the orchard stretch higher toward the rafters. <words>306</words>
In that hush, I know why I serve, to witness a moment of pure grace that asks nothing but presence and offers everything. <words>329</words>
Downstairs, the sump empties; upstairs, the bees settle, and the engines and the choir time their breathing together during oil changes. <words>350</words>
The radio crackles, asking for mileage logs, and my voice answers with the same impassive deputy cadence that keeps panic filed. <words>371</words>
Inside, however, something tilts, a personally impersonal axis easing, as though duty could hold wonder without smudging either. <words>389</words>
The uncharted echoes carry a map anyway, of droughts and blossoms, of sirens and lullabies, of every oath whispered between carburetors and candles. <words>412</words>
I coil the twisted twist tie back into my pocket, a small talisman that remembers how metal can be taught to cradle the fragile. <words>436</words>
When the engines turn, the cathedral exhales, and the orchard spanning the rafters answers with a soft, survivable thunder. <words>455</words>
I drive out steady, brave enough to guard the fragile, and brave enough to notice it. <words>471</words></story>
