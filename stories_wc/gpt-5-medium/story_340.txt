I was the proud exorcist the canopy called when nostalgia went feral. <words>12</words>
Our treehouse city in the amazon wore ladders like necklaces and secrets like sap. <words>26</words>
Tonight the wind practiced playful cynicism, rattling prayer gourds as if divinity were loose change. <words>41</words>
The elders pressed into my hands a wizard's battered grimoire, damp with river breath and rumors. <words>57</words>
They wanted a cleansing, and I wanted to outshine a looming shadow I refused to name. <words>73</words>
Responsibility sat heavy as a jaguar under the floorboards, purring promises of teeth if I stumbled. <words>89</words>
The first clue came when the town clock dared to skip a beat, and the hammocks answered with gasps. <words>108</words>
Time hiccuped, and children became briefly taller, then younger, as if laughter could youthify and then regret it. <words>126</words>
I flipped the grimoire and found a note from its last owner, a complainer with elegant handwriting. <words>143</words>
Beware the path that always works, it read, for salvation prefers a sudden closure of a usual path. <words>161</words>
I tasted the advice and spat a smile, because sensible warnings are garnish for the truly stubborn. <words>178</words>
Still, I tethered my pride to a quieter beam and listened to the vines arguing softly. <words>194</words>
The haunting was endearingly feisty, a little girl spirit teaching leaves to slap anyone who walked beneath. <words>211</words>
She had died the last time the clock skipped, when a bridge looked solid but absence arrived first. <words>229</words>
Now the bridges pulsed like throats, and the city feared its own heartbeat turning traitor. <words>244</words>
I called to her with jokes and apologies, which are cousins where I come from. <words>259</words>
She answered by snapping shut the monkey trail, a sudden closure of our usual path back home. <words>276</words>
Good strategy, I said, hoping admiration might unlatch anger, because praise is a key that flatters bolts. <words>293</words>
But the grimoire hummed, and its ink shuffled like ants, offering a ritual that would youthify her hurt. <words>311</words>
I could make her new, lighter than guilt, and carry the weight of responsibility myself like gear. <words>328</words>
Pride growled, insisting I save the city without sacrificing edges, while the shadow of failure posed dramatically. <words>345</words>
To outshine a looming shadow, you sometimes stand in it and polish, which is not comforting but true. <words>363</words>
So I asked the girl what she wanted when the clock dares to skip a beat again. <words>380</words>
She wanted the bridges to apologize, the elders to remember her name, and the air to hold her steady. <words>399</words>
I told the vines to clasp hands, then borrowed the megaphone of thunder to broadcast her small biography. <words>417</words>
Names fell like seeds, and the city repeated them until the bark learned the syllables without splinters. <words>434</words>
Then I opened the grimoire and traded one year of my next decade to youthify her sorrow into play. <words>453</words>
The spell stung like honest laughter, and her hands unclenched, letting the monkey trail breathe open again. <words>470</words>
When the clock skipped once more, it paused to wipe its feet, and the bridges held as promised. <words>488</words>
I saluted the shadow; it shrank, and my pride finally shared. <words>499</words>
