After the scoreboard reset again, the luminous swamp breathed like a stadium holding its breath, and I adjusted my visor slowly. <words>21</words>
I am Sir Calyx, a straight-laced knight assigned to audit miracles, which is glamorous in a painfully tidy way for some. <words>42</words>
Tonight, my motive sparkled: to collect urban legends before the mud-slick crowds dispersed and the swamp resumed whispering scores to roots. <words>63</words>
Legend number one hid on a shelf in the concession raft, guarded by a clerk and a gloweringly academic rebel archaeologist. <words>84</words>
We reached for the last item on the shelf simultaneously, bumping into each other, and the raft rocked like polite thunder. <words>105</words>
In my hand landed a fossilized snail shell, rumored to broadcast victory totals to anyone patient enough to verify its spiral. <words>126</words>
The scholar, academically rebellious in posture and credential, called herself Mirelle and accused me of auditing wonder into boredom, too often. <words>147</words>
I said, laconic but exhilarated, that boredom is simply wonder wearing armor, and tonight my armor felt cheerfully weightless under moonlight. <words>168</words>
Firefly lilies lit the aisles, and the swamp's luminous veins pulsed to the crowd's chant, as referees re-sorted destinies between halves. <words>189</words>
The reset scoreboard promised converging destinies, as if fate itself kept statistics and had just declared overtime on both our quests. <words>210</words>
We decided, tersely delighted, to share the shell for one circuit, documenting the myth and splitting the coinage of truth fairly. <words>231</words>
I verified the shell's grooves against a referee's chalkboard, while Mirelle leaned over my shoulder sketching equations nobody had authorized anywhere. <words>252</words>
My code required witness, notarized by swamp light, and her joy required trespass; the combination felt like lawful mischief for once. <words>273</words>
The legend said the shell recorded every championship volley since the marsh-born game began, storing cheers as fossilized tempo and hush. <words>294</words>
Officials noticed, fans swarmed, and gamblers sniffed destiny, but we slipped through cattails toward the archival bog, hearts drumming in unison. <words>315</words>
Walking, she confessed a thesis rejected for insubordination; I admitted knighthood imposed spreadsheets on miracles; somehow our destinies matched cadence nicely. <words>336</words>
Her laughter was concise fireworks, and my answers were yes, no, perhaps, always; laconic exuberance stitched our shared stride that night. <words>357</words>
At the bog's center, the shell rang when set in ooze, spilling scores as notes, names, and meteor-bright sighs for decades. <words>378</words>
We verified the echoes, logged them, then chose guardianship over hoarding, agreeing that collected legends breathe longest when regularly risked together. <words>399</words>
When the match resumed and the scoreboard blinked anew, we returned to our seats, champions of verification, apprentices to converging destinies. <words>420</words>
