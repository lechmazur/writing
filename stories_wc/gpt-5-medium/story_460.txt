<story>In the acid rain forest, an unassuming monarch drifted beneath burned canopy, moving with a lethargically energetic patience that matched the slow hiss of leaves dissolving to lace. <words>28</words>
After the collapse of civilization, she had inherited a crown of dull tin and a promise to carry a kingdom without walls. <words>50</words>
Her scepter was a box of mismatched puzzle pieces, scavenged from schools where chalk ghosts still hovered along cracked blackboards. <words>70</words>
Each piece was warped by acid mist, yet their stubborn teeth clicked with prickly wonder whenever she tried them against the world's broken edges. <words>94</words>
She sought not thrones or sermons, but to cradle wisdom in rough, calloused hands, and keep it warm as tinder in a soaked wilderness. <words>118</words>
For that, she followed rumors of a spark called the ember of choice, said to relight governance without lighting domination. <words>138</words>
People argued about its shape, but she trained herself to perceive via the texture of a feather, because sight lied in chemical rain. <words>161</words>
She wore a bandolier of molted heron quills, stroking them across bark, stone, and bones, reading tingles that crawled like ants through her fingertips. <words>185</words>
On nights when the rain etched holes in her tent, she sorted the puzzle box, matching cloud-swollen blues to soot-black corners. <words>206</words>
The pieces refused completion, yet their near-fit taught her where not to force, and where patient pressure could coax a hidden image to breathe. <words>230</words>
In the ribcage of a toppled water tower, she found a shrine of feathers turned to ash, and a faint warmth pulsing under slag. <words>254</words>
She tested the rubble with a quill, feeling a velvet rasp that spelled out a single path, as if the ground itself was sore of being trampled. <words>281</words>
Following, she reached a clearing where trees grew armored bark and the rain stitched silver threads between thorns, and there a coal breathed like a sleeping mouse. <words>308</words>
The ember of choice was small enough for her palm, dangerous enough to question her, and it asked whether a monarch without trumpet could bear counsel without command. <words>336</words>
She answered by opening the box of mismatched puzzle pieces and letting their near-answers whisper, choosing slowness, choosing edges, choosing the ache of unfinished thought. <words>361</words>
The ember brightened, licking her calluses with heat that stung and soothed, a prickly wonder that promised power only if carried like water in joined hands. <words>387</words>
She cupped it, and the forest exhaled, leaves fizzing into clarity where before they had been scars. <words>404</words>
In that hissed hush, she could perceive how choices braid into shelter, how refusals prune cruelty, how listening grows roofs. <words>424</words>
She swore no decrees, only a cadence: touch first, decide after, and carry the ember like a question everyone could hold. <words>445</words>
