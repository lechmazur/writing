At the interdimensional airport lounge, I checked the clocks that swerved like fish through air, and time smelled like luggage tags and lightning. <words>23</words>
Between boarding gates to Elsewhere and Return, a morose sentinel polished an amber pendant until it burned with a tired, migratory light. <words>45</words>
He said the pendant contained our terminal's custodial soul, and I, being objectively emotional, believed him the way one believes a weather report. <words>68</words>
Flights arrived across the tapestry of hidden hours, their passengers blinking in languages built from receipts, lullabies, and maps that refused to unfurl. <words>91</words>
The sentinel kept watch for the tides of compromise that lap between realities, bargaining away synonyms for home in exchange for seats with better views. <words>116</words>
I was here to resurrect the meaning of home, which had fractured into boarding zones, security bins, and a thousand well-meaning announcements. <words>138</words>
The sentinel offered a lesson: read the marquees like prophecy, and when the letters glitch, listen for the old gate agents humming the names we forgot. <words>164</words>
His voice wore mysterious familiarity, like the smell of a house sold years ago yet still baking bread in a neighbor's memory. <words>186</words>
He asked for my itinerary and, seeing I had none, opened the pendant so its resin window showed trapped dusk, a miniature terminal waiting for us. <words>212</words>
Within, concourses braided like rivers, and our footsteps stirred cancellations into constellations that suggested a route through the unclaimed baggage of ourselves. <words>234</words>
We could exit, he said, by matching the hammered shapes on a blacksmith's anvil to the dents in the pendant's rim, a gate keyed to patience rather than tickets. <words>263</words>
So we ransacked the lounge for echoes of iron, arranging lost umbrella ribs, bottle caps, and tiny airplane pins until the pattern could confess. <words>287</words>
As each hammered curve found its mate, the pendant began to vibrate with departures long past, and the lounge around us softened into a weather of letters. <words>314</words>
Meaning, thin as a boarding pass, started to unfurl from the pendant's seam, a script that was less instruction than forgiveness. <words>335</words>
I saw my childhood doorway and the mud on the mat, and he saw a lighthouse whose bulb was a duty-free bottle of salt water, still sealed. <words>362</words>
The tides of compromise rolled in, whispering what we must trade: some certainty for wonder, some schedules for songs, some sorrow for the room to return. <words>388</words>
We agreed, not with signatures but with breath, and the sentinel's morose watchfulness broke like a storm that finally sees its own horizon. <words>411</words>
When the pendant clicked shut, the lounge became a foyer, our names arriving on the wind, and home, resurrected, stamped its passport in our ribcages. <words>436</words>
