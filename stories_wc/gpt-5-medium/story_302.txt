I am a tuneless bard with a mouth full of thunder and a pocket deliberately empty of melody. <words>18</words>
Tonight I sing anyway, because the steampunk airship dining room demands spectacle even when it cannot demand pitch. <words>36</words>
Around me, valves wheeze and chandeliers pulse like mechanical jellyfish, and we are amid poetry readings that hiss and glitter. <words>56</words>
I keep brazen humility balanced on my tongue, the only flavor that pairs with brass and the aftertaste of storms. <words>76</words>
My stained manuscript rests by the water carafe, edges burned by journeys, paragraphs lopsided from engine tremors and sudden regrets. <words>96</words>
Its margins mutter taming chaos like a vow written sideways, as though order only answers when you face it crooked. <words>116</words>
I flick open my tinderbox, strike a spark, and let ash drift onto the tablecloth like punctuation too hot to touch. <words>137</words>
Heat steadies my hands while the audience steadies their courage, because I am fiercely nonchalant and it leaks onto them. <words>157</words>
They have heard of me via twisted word-of-mouth legends, which improve me the farther they travel from the truth. <words>176</words>
Those legends say I duct-taped tempests and taught clocks to cough, but really I just listen until the noise surrenders. <words>196</words>
I speak now, not singing, but pouring notes like bent nails, telling them why I travel, which is to kiss the horizon of madness. <words>220</words>
Madness has a better view of the map, and it tilts the compass so the brave can discover whatever they almost deserve. <words>242</words>
A heckler taps a fork against a boiler, claiming I cannot tune a soul when I cannot tune myself. <words>261</words>
I agree, because agreement disarms faster than anger, and because my music is a net woven of holes large enough for monsters. <words>283</words>
When monsters pass through, the room exhales, and what remains are the outlines we can name, which is how taming begins. <words>304</words>
I raise the stained manuscript, read a paragraph that never rhymes, and the chandeliers dim themselves as if kneeling to grammar. <words>325</words>
It tells of a captain who swallowed a compass rose and spoke directions through coughs, guiding us between whirlwinds like threading needles. <words>347</words>
The heckler lowers his fork, because the rose thorns in that story prick him where ambition hides, and his boiler clanks apology. <words>369</words>
I tell them my secret is brazen humility, the courage to admit I am not the hero, only the herald. <words>389</words>
The hero is the room itself, this steampunk airship dining room that wants taming chaos and hires a fool to rehearse surrender. <words>411</words>
So I bow, spill a little spark from the tinderbox, and let the legends walk ahead while I follow softly, fiercely nonchalant. <words>433</words>
Behind us, order tiptoes after chaos like a younger sibling, amid poetry readings that finally find their breath and share it. <words>454</words>
