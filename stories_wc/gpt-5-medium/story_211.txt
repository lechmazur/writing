<story>
I arrived at the abandoned schoolhouse in a ghost town with a grin I barely trusted. <words>16</words>
It was in the hush of the unremembered future, where even echoes seemed to blush at their own persistence. <words>35</words>
I was a lucky gambler who typically never lost, except at quitting while hope still had decent odds. <words>53</words>
In my pack I carried a botanical diary, its browned pages annotated with wagers placed upon roots, rains, and seasons. <words>73</words>
The diary claimed every plant could duplicate itself if watered with candor, and I was thirsty for truth. <words>91</words>
So I drew a chalk circle on the schoolhouse floor and sought answers through spin-the-bottle confessions with dust and desks. <words>111</words>
The bottle chose the principal's portrait, webbed and listing, and I asked what power had done to the children here. <words>131</words>
It told me power learned to smile while stealing chalk, then erasing names until no one remembered they could speak. <words>151</words>
Cheerful despair bubbled in my ribs, because I knew the trick, and still applauded the show. <words>167</words>
I cracked the diary and pressed a seed between two pages, promising it a fair bet against the grave. <words>186</words>
To defy the gravity of hopelessness, I poured a confession straight from my throat, raw as unclaimed winnings. <words>204</words>
I confessed I once fixed a wheel, not to cheat, but to ensure joy would land on someone starving for it. <words>225</words>
The seed split, then sprouted in the principal's inkwell, twin stems rising like matched cards turned face up. <words>243</words>
Duplication, the diary whispered, is not generosity but conquest, because a copy steals the future from the possible. <words>261</words>
The bottle spun again and pointed to me, and the desks creaked like bookies adjusting odds. <words>277</words>
I typically never tell the real story, yet the future listened, so I gambled my silence and raised it. <words>296</words>
I said that luck corrupted me by making every risk feel charitable, every theft feel like a donation to destiny. <words>316</words>
Power loved that pose, the room replied, because nothing is easier to govern than a saint who keeps winning. <words>335</words>
I laughed like a cracked bell and told the stems to duplicate again, this time with losses, with limits, with memory. <words>356</words>
They listened, bending toward the broken windows, and the town outside learned to bloom on bets it could afford to lose. <words>377</words>
The portrait sighed, lighter, as if its chalk throat had finally paid its debts. <words>391</words>
I closed the diary, promising to gamble smaller, and to plant receipts beside every prayer. <words>406</words>
The bottle stopped rolling at the doorway, where tomorrow waited, patient as an unpaid dealer. <words>421</words>
I tipped the future, not with money, but with the new rule I would follow. <words>436</words>
Win less, share more, and never let power turn a mirror into a mask again. <words>451</words>
Behind me, the blackboard kept writing the corruption of power, then erasing it, until chalk became forgiveness. <words>468</words>
