<story>I stood inside the ribcage of the fossilized giant, straw lungs quiet, watching dust fall like tired snow. <words>18</words>
My oath kept me there, a sentinel woven from barbed twine and husks, with fervent apathy toward everything but duty. <words>38</words>
Lines in the earth radiated from the skull, faulted seams between parallel worlds where breaths confused their owners. <words>56</words>
Farmers called them furrows, scholars called them fractures, and I called them the handwriting of consequences. <words>72</words>
At twilight, encounters in virtual reality stitched me to travelers I would never meet, avatars ghosting across my straw. <words>91</words>
They logged into the seamlike network, and I logged feelings I insisted were compost, still warm despite denial. <words>109</words>
One wore a circlet of paper receipts and asked if the forgotten lace fan belonged to the buried queen here. <words>129</words>
I answered that the queen decomposed; what remained was wind, sighing through holes in her etiquette and mine. <words>147</words>
Another carried a pitchfork rendered in pixels sharp enough to skewer a cloud, and still begged for harvest weather. <words>166</words>
Their wants passed through me like locust swarms, leaving husked silences that filled my head with practical starlight. <words>184</words>
Realistically fantastical, the world obeyed cause while permitting miracles to file receipts: straw casts shadows, bones store thunder. <words>202</words>
The oath I bore was older than the giant, sworn to the soil to referee crossings without choosing a side. <words>222</words>
A side chose me anyway when a child appeared, glitching, holding the lace fan like a folded moth wing. <words>241</words>
She fanned the dust, and the lines in the earth flared, showing two summers arguing over the same field. <words>260</words>
Her village survived in one world by stealing water; in the other, by stealing names from the thirsty. <words>278</words>
She wanted adjudication, and I wanted not to want anything, which is a want sharp enough to draw blood. <words>297</words>
We opened the fan together, discovering a map stitched from etiquette orders, each rib pointing to a buried apology. <words>316</words>
The fossilized giant murmured with settling stone, and I heard verdicts like seeds tapping against a jar's glass. <words>334</words>
I laid the fan along a seam, measuring breath debts, then declared a tax of stories payable in evening labor. <words>354</words>
No water stolen, no names stolen; instead, exchange histories until the soil recognizes both footprints as necessary. <words>371</words>
It was not mercy, only arithmetic comprised of roots and rain, the apathy of fairness pursued with stubborn heat. <words>390</words>
The child closed the fan, and the VR crowd applauded as if clapping could irrigate their parallel hungers. <words>408</words>
I stood again in ribs and twilight, oath taut, feeling nothing except the relief of principled emptiness achieved. <words>426</words>
Lines in the earth dimmed, yet I stayed, the scarecrow jurist, because staying is how some promises walk. <words>444</words>
Between worlds, I keep watch with straw eyes and a lace map, guarding crossings with apathy tempered by fire. <words>463</words>
When the giant shifts again, I will skewer my doubts on a sunbeam and let them fossilize beside me. <words>482</words>
