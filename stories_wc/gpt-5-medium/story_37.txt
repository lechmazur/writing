In the clinic perched among strangler figs, I sat amid the uncertain silence of a doctor's waiting room, restraining my hands from old reflexes. <words>24</words>
A reformed con artist should not shuffle pockets, but mine still remembered how to palm things and vanish. <words>42</words>
Today, I wanted nothing to disappear, least of all the crumpled sheet music sweating in my fist. <words>59</words>
It was not a score for a concert, but a guide to a call, a yodel the canopy would answer if I was worthy. <words>83</words>
The rainforest canopy village spread like a harp strung on mist, and the clinic's rafters creaked politely as if clearing their throats. <words>105</words>
Outside, bridges were closed for repairs, and I had taken a detour to avoid a construction zone that rattled with hammers and parrots. <words>128</words>
Each plank on that detour taught rhythm; my steps found the rests the sheet demanded. <words>143</words>
The doctor took his time, letting the rainforest breathe around us, and in that hush, gradual revelations unfolded. <words>161</words>
First, I admitted my attribute to the varnished floorboards, that I was dishonestly honest, telling truths wrapped in glitter to make them spend. <words>184</words>
Then I confessed my motive: to become the guardian of tomorrow's flame, the village's promise kept alive when storms came hunting. <words>205</words>
The flame was not fire alone, the elders taught, but memory, warning, maps, and song braided against forgetting. <words>223</words>
To bear it, I had to sing the route past fog, to yodel across the green chasms until gliders turned their wings by trust. <words>247</words>
That was why I needed the checkup, why I waited, to learn if my lungs, once used for lying, could finally be used for guidance. <words>272</words>
My old scams sold futures I never intended to deliver; this flame demanded I deliver futures I did not own. <words>292</words>
The sheet music, rescued from a gutter after last season's monsoon, had annotations in a hand I recognized as mine from years ago. <words>315</words>
Back then, I forged maps; now I realized I had copied an honesty from the forest, finding the intervals between deceptions and calling them roads. <words>340</words>
When the doctor returned, she smiled the way moss smiles, slow and certain, and said my breath rode strong on the stethoscope. <words>362</words>
I stepped onto the balcony and lifted my head, and the first note went crooked, then truer, then true, and the village answered in light. <words>387</words>
Lights flickered along ropeways as if embers raced from hut to hut, sketching tomorrow on the air with strokes of gold. <words>408</words>
I told the truth without sequins, a plain confession cast like netting, and the yodel lifted again, brighter, because honesty finally had an accomplice in me. <words>434</words>
The doctor closed the door behind her, leaving only leaves and listening, and the sheet in my hand uncrumpled itself, becoming the map I would keep lit. <words>461</words>
