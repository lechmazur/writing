<story>The morning carried a shouting silence that pressed like velvet on my ears. <words>13</words>
Under the soft hush of a distant morning, I, a melodic sculptor, drove without plan, chasing a rumor that refused to fade. <words>35</words>
They said a sudden road trip leads to an unexpected meeting if the wheels sing the right key. <words>53</words>
In our coastal town, local legends prove peculiarly reliable, the way tide tables keep their appointments with the moon. <words>72</words>
One legend swore a muse was imprisoned beneath roots in a mysterious forest glade at dawn, and I meant to unchain an imprisoned muse. <words>96</words>
In the passenger seat rattled jars of botanical specimens whose leaves remembered songs I had carved into stone. <words>114</words>
A melodic sculptor survives on resonance, coaxing notes into shapes that can be held, mended, and sometimes freed. <words>132</words>
I followed a gravel ribbon through fir and alder until the road ended at a gate of thorns, and beyond lay the glade. <words>155</words>
Dawn tilted a pale coin over the canopy, and the clearing breathed sap and lacquer, an orchestra tuning without instruments. <words>175</words>
There, by the oldest stump, a stranger was waiting, and our eyes performed the unexpected meeting the wheels had promised. <words>195</words>
She wore a luthier's apron, sawdust stippling her sleeves, her gaze peculiarly reliable, the exact pitch of a tuning fork held to the earth. <words>219</words>
I told her I had come to unchain an imprisoned muse because my own chisels now struck sparks without sound. <words>239</words>
She nodded, saying the legends were maps for people who persevere, and that the muse had once sung through her hands too. <words>261</words>
Now the trees answered only with shouting silence, a roar so calm it flattened every hurried thought. <words>278</words>
We unpacked the jars, releasing aromas like faint chords, and fitted the botanical specimens to notches carved into the stump. <words>298</words>
When I tapped the wood, resinous echoes rose, and the stranger calibrated them with a bow drawn across air, measuring silence like grain. <words>321</words>
We spoke the names of rivers and storms, and the clearing answered with a fissure of light uncoiling from beneath the roots. <words>343</words>
A figure rose, more weather than person, the imprisoned muse, her voice braided into moss, her eyes stunned by freedom's gentle ache. <words>365</words>
She asked what payment we offered, and I laid my hammer upon the stump while the stranger offered the last splinter of her hearing. <words>389</words>
The muse cradled our tools, then breathed, returning tone to the bow and echo to the chisel, promising to guide those who persevere. <words>412</words>
We left the glade as dawn brightened, our road trip proved, peculiarly reliable as tide, an unexpected meeting remaking our craft and our small town's legends. <words>438</words>
Under the soft hush of a distant morning, the shouting silence no longer threatened, it listened, and the muse walked beside us, unchained. <words>461</words></story>
