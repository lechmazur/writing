<story>I reached the disused railway station overgrown with ivy after stopping the medication. [13]
I am a truth-seeking river chronicler, and today my work is not to measure but to mend. [30]
I came to find a path to self-forgiveness, and I chose the station because the river once chose it for me. [51]
Under my arm I carried the accordion bellows patched with tape, my brother's battered metronome of breath. [68]
When he played here, the station breathed too, the ivy whispering time while coins clinked in a dented cup. [87]
He drowned on a night I had mapped the flood wrongly, storm drunk with certainty, and I have been counting apologies ever since. [110]
I stopped the pills to hear if my mind still had a river in it, or only static. [128]
The waiting room had turned into a green chapel, pews of nettle and pewter rails, and I knelt to the past without kneeling to despair. [153]
My method is daringly methodical, and it began not with instruments but with the restroom door. [169]
I had read, once, that the best cartographers listen to every wall for coordinates, so I searched the tiles for map references. [191]
Under a cracked mirror, faded ink did allude to the old index: River does what it was asked to do. [211]
Next to it, arrows pointed to numbers I knew from survey sheets, and a hand drew a little blue mouth that said, Begin again. [235]
Through bathroom graffiti wisdom, the station confessed the truth of my brother and the flood more plainly than any tribunal. [255]
The scribbles were not prayers but map references disguised as jokes, as if a drunk surveyor had come here to absolve the night shift. [279]
I copied each coordinate into my field book, noting the hand styles, measuring the pressure of ink, weighing the pause at every comma. [302]
Daringly methodical, I treated the stall walls as a river cross section, a transect of voices sedimented by time and rain. [323]
When I emerged, the ivy shimmered like soundproofing, and I pressed the patched bellows open and closed to hear the river breathe. [345]
The notes were shy, but their sigh matched the isobars that had tricked me the night of the flood, rising then falling with the hour. [370]
I followed the graffiti instructions across the platform, down an embankment slit by foxes, and along the culvert where the river nuzzles its rail-bed grief. [395]
At the first bend a mossed milestone matched the smeared numbers, and my heart, skittish but awake, began to trust the world again. [418]
The second mark led to a sluice gate scarred by rust, where I had once cut a corner to make a deadline sing. [441]
I had told the agency the river would crest lower, because the model liked tidy creeds, and a town trusted the tidiness I sold. [465]
My brother busked that same week beside this gate, cheer in a dead-end key, to fund a train seat out and away. [487]
When the water came sly and fast, he ran to warn an old woman at the underpass, and the river kept the warning for itself. [512]
I lay down by the gate and set the accordion bellows patched with tape on my ribs, then breathed until our rhythms met. [535]
In the low reedy wheeze I heard the sentence from the mirror again, only now it was not a verdict but an instruction. [558]
River does what it was asked to do, and I had asked it, with my lazy certainty, to be smaller than itself. [580]
I had made it a mirror of me instead of a muscle of earth, and he had trusted my mirror. [600]
The graffiti led me farther, to the culvert mouth where boys hide cigarettes, and there a final arrow pointed to a shallow in the current. [625]
The shallow was where his body had bumped and drifted, the place I could name but could not enter until now. [646]
I stepped in and counted to twelve, as he had taught me when we were small, hands on knees, breath like bellows, then let the sum go. [673]
Water took the number and returned a different one, not smaller, not larger, just honest about its weight and mine. [693]
I marked the margin with a stick and wrote in my field book that the river was itself, and that I would stop asking it to be me. [721]
On the walk back, the station seemed less like a ruin and more like a ledger, each ivy vein an entry, each crack a clause reframing blame. [748]
The bathroom graffiti wisdom, crude and luminous, had made a method out of mercy, and my daring did not feel like flight but like footing. [773]</story>
