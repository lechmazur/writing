<story>At the first ring of a call that changes fate, the haunted amusement park haunted house exhales its ephemeral gloom around me. <words>22</words>
I am an underestimated rebel with pockets full of plans and a pocket knife with multiple blades warming my palm. <words>42</words>
Tonight I came to prime a stagnant heart for wonder, starting with my own, which forgot how to thrum. <words>61</words>
The queue outside murmurs like a tired tide, and the neon skeletons inside flicker as if remembering weather. <words>79</words>
I slip backstage where the ride operators stash fake cobwebs, because the art of adaptation starts where scripts end. <words>98</words>
My phone trembles, and I know whose number it is, the mentor who told me rebellion needs tenderness. <words>116</words>
I will answer only once I am ready, at the first ring holding my breath like a lit match. <words>135</words>
Being sadly joyful is my camouflage, grinning at shadows while cataloging every exit, every switch, every shuddering animatronic. <words>153</words>
I move through trapdoors and sodium, adjusting until the roles reverse and the house is the guest in me. <words>172</words>
The art of adaptation taught me to listen for hinge sighs, to intensify when fear dilutes, to soften when bravado hardens. <words>193</words>
In the mirror maze I leave chalk arrows shaped like spoons, recalling nights we chased steam at the ramen stall. <words>213</words>
Our pact was sealed by a shared love for a specific type of cuisine, namely Hakata broth, saline with patience and hope. <words>235</words>
She believed flavors could counsel cities, and I believed cities could be carved like pumpkins with the right blade. <words>254</words>
When the hallway ghosts fall silent, I open my pocket knife with multiple blades, choosing the thin saw to free a stuck door. <words>277</words>
Every tooth bites wood in small patient rhythms, and with each rasp I remember her paper cranes and the storm that scattered them. <words>300</words>
I am not breaking in so much as breaking open, loosening rooms that have forgotten their purpose and their pulse. <words>320</words>
The ride jitters awake, and I guide it into slowness, like telling a crowded kitchen story in a whisper. <words>339</words>
In that hush, her call finally rings, one clean bell, and I answer with a map of ramen steam on my tongue. <words>361</words>
I tell her the house is haunted by choices we delayed, and that I have prepared a room for wonder to return. <words>383</words>
Come, I say, and let us meet where the queue ends, sadly joyful, and rebuild appetite, courage, and city with broth and adaptation. <words>406</words></story>
