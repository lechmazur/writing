I was the unlucky meteorologist who kept smelling auroras before they formed, a talent that made bosses chuckle and storms obey. <words>21</words>
My contract stranded me underground, in the city of the lizard people, to study plant behaviors that glowed like hesitant constellations. <words>42</words>
The air tasted like bitter honey and chalk, as if sweetness had been calculated by an untrustworthy abacus. <words>60</words>
Their gardens curled along thermal vents, systematically chaotic, a fractal order that mocked my tidy field notes. <words>77</words>
I carried a mariner's sextant like a relic, pointing it at dripping stalactites as though stars hid behind stone. <words>96</words>
The lizard archivist clicked that instruments were for seas, not ceilings, and asked why I courted failure so faithfully. <words>115</words>
Because, I said, gravity has a voice, and I am drawn to cosmic events the way moss thirsts for a cave mouth. <words>137</words>
He admitted their vines swelled before meteors passed overhead, a rumor of pressure that set seedpods ticking like clocks. <words>156</words>
Between colliding interests of city safety and my data hunger, the council demanded spoken truths without embellishment. <words>173</words>
I promised only this, that the sky cares nothing for subpoenas, but roots can overhear what heavens refuse to confess. <words>193</words>
In a fungus market, I had an unexpected encounter while taking a shortcut with a diplomat in molting robes. <words>212</words>
She sparred with metaphors the way swordsmen spar, flicking phrases that smelled of iron, and asked for a weather that told the truth. <words>235</words>
I gave her my forecast like a confession, a systematically chaotic map of probabilities braided with the plants' whispered timings. <words>255</words>
She traded me a lantern of cold saltlight and a promise of access to the root-catacombs where the elder vines dreamed. <words>276</words>
The archivist warned that elders extracted payment in memories, but my patience had already been pawned to the coming meteor shower. <words>297</words>
We descended through columns slick as silver fish, and the sextant measured echo angles as if charting starless tides. <words>316</words>
Roots pulsed like throats swallowing thunder, and a chorus of spoken truths rose from their vessels, naming orbits long before astronomers would. <words>338</words>
I realized my bad luck was simply timing, forever arriving between colliding interests, where useful harms and harmful uses traded masks. <words>359</words>
So I negotiated with the elders, offering a weather report braided into a lullaby, and they demanded one memory with each stanza. <words>381</words>
I paid with my first day under open sky and received in return the pattern of the seedpods, a clockwork mercy that could save the city. <words>407</words>
Back above the hot vents, the underground city of the lizard people listened as the vines kept their time. <words>426</words>
I raised the sextant like a bell, struck it with my breath, and their smiles tasted again of bitter honey. <words>446</words>
