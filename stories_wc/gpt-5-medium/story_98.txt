<story>I am a fainthearted sentinel pretending at bravery while the leash tugs me down the alley. <words>16</words>
It is amid dog walking that the invitation vibrates in my pocket like a moth. <words>31</words>
The address leads to a warped door, and behind it waits a secret society initiation chamber smelling of chalk and fennel. <words>52</words>
They let me keep the dog, perhaps because he looks like a scholar with his gray muzzle and patient eyes. <words>72</words>
My steps are determined wandering, the sort that circles the same stone twice before admitting it has arrived. <words>90</words>
I came to learn ancient writings, to excavate grammar from dust, to break the hush of centuries without breaking myself. <words>110</words>
The masters confer in voices intimately distant, as if whispering from the far corner of my own chest. <words>128</words>
They show me a woven wall hanging and say the script can be read through the patterns in a woven tapestry. <words>149</words>
At first I see only birds and rivers, then I notice tiny bends of thread that drift into letters like wind deciding to speak. <words>173</words>
My only instrument is a plain plastic ruler scavenged from my school days, its edge nicked like a coastline. <words>192</words>
I lay it along the tapestry, measuring the distances between curls, testing whether spacing itself is a verb conjugation. <words>211</words>
The dog yawns, then braces beside me like an anchor, and the room becomes a harbor where fears can moor. <words>231</words>
Yet I understand the illusion of security, the way ritual gates and passwords promise more than they keep. <words>249</words>
I am a guard who trembles, a fainthearted sentinel sworn to watch thresholds others never notice. <words>265</words>
Perhaps that is why they chose me, because such trembling is a sensorium, a net that catches subtleties as they attempt escape. <words>287</words>
I trace a spiral, and the letters unfurl into instructions for breathing, for asking permission from silence before you question it. <words>308</words>
I measure again, and the ruler points to an arched border where thread thickens into a sentence about mercy toward animals who guide us. <words>332</words>
The dog looks up, and I feel a tug that is not the leash but the text insisting I finish the walk. <words>354</words>
Permission granted, I carry the chamber with me by memorizing its draft, its smell, its lamps, letting the space drift softly into the streets. <words>378</words>
Outside, I practice the new alphabet on puddles and curb shadows, and passersby read nothing while I read everything. <words>397</words>
The city becomes an initiation chamber without walls, and trust becomes a leash I choose to hold lightly. <words>415</words>
