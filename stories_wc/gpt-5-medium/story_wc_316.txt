<story>The day I remembered myself, I stood barefoot in the floating rock dojo, an ego death survivor watching clouds pass under the sparring floor like slow rivers of breath. [29]
Around us, bells tolled from the sky while history rewrites itself, and every strike we practiced seemed to echo into edits no historian had approved. [54]
Master Lin taught through complementary opposites, pairing soft breath with hard steps, kindness with demand, until the blade of attention slices through pretense and the mind stops lying to itself. [84]
I trained to defeat emotional numbness, that frost after the void that made each face look like a mask painted on glass. [106]
The temple received petitions that week for a clone custody battle, a legal storm about who could guard a brain in a jar labeled duplicate. [131]
The brain belonged to my line, or to many lines maybe, because the cloning vats had copied our ancestor until names loosened like threads in seawater. [157]
Two petitioners came to train and argue before Master Lin, each claiming they would vivify the mind within that glass if only he would bless their custody. [184]
First was Neri, who had never met a mirror she could not forgive, who spoke in measured syllables that could soothe steel. [206]
Second was Rae, whose laugh had once broken a tyrant, whose eyes wove rage and tenderness into one bright cord. [226]
Both wore my cheekbones and sick morning scars, both carried the genotype that fit the jar like a key fits a wound. [248]
Master Lin set the terms inside the floating rock dojo, not a courtroom but a windroom, and said the victor would be the one who could join life to life through complementary opposites. [281]
They would spar in movements that mirrored the old mind inside the jar, and they would answer questions from its past as the clouds wrote and wiped the world below. [311]
I became the recorder and the blade, appointed witness and final coin toss, because I alone had crawled back from nothing and could hear what the jar wanted. [339]
For days we trained, Neri soft where Rae was sharp, Rae swift where Neri endured, each feeding the other until breath and bone ran in circuits of mutual charge. [368]
Watching them, I felt the old ice crack, because their practice slices through pretense better than sermons, and even excuses begin to confess when paired with motion. [395]
The brain in a jar labeled duplicate hummed on the altar, sending little gusts of static to our teeth while history rewrites itself around the dojo like a storm correcting a map. [427]
At night I spoke to it, asking which sound it trusted, which hands had guided it when it still owned lungs, and it replied in taste and scent and the ache of distant songs. [461]
Once it showed me a river where a child would not step in, then did, and learned both fear and joy, the lesson of entering and leaving at once. [490]
That was when I understood the test was not about guardianship but about a circuit, a way to vivify the dormant patterns through complementary opposites held and released. [518]
On the final morning, I asked Neri and Rae to carry the jar across the umber tiles, one moving like water, the other like fire, trading roles at my shout. [548]
As they moved, statues in the courtyard rearranged themselves into our future, and the years below braided new dates, because while history rewrites itself, it listens for choices made in high air. [580]
The jar vibrated when Neri took fire and Rae took water, a subtle consent that brushed my teeth again, and the taste of river stones returned like a password. [609]
I announced that the custody would be joint and indivisible, that only together could they keep the mind awake, because the pattern required the alternating current of their opposites. [638]
They did not cheer, and neither did I, but I felt the frost inside me drain as if a plug had been pulled, because choosing them together finally gave me a way to defeat emotional numbness. [674]
The dojo drifted on, the clouds paused, and the brain in the jar breathed its answer through our teeth, and for a quiet minute the future felt vivified, real, and ours. [705]</story>
