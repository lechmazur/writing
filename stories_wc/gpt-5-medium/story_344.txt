In the hush of improbable beginnings, the floating rock tea house drifted like a steady breath above an overcast sea. <words>20</words>
I stepped inside, an underwater explorer with claustrophobia who studied people the way others read currents. <words>36</words>
My motivation, quietly bold and lightly heavyhearted, was to study human behaviors without announcing that aim aloud. <words>53</words>
A pair of wire-rimmed glasses kept sliding down my nose, fogged by the steam that scented the air with plum. <words>73</words>
The proprietor, a woman with calloused palms and a healing touch, poured tea that calmed storms I carried in my chest. <words>94</words>
She said the house hovered on old constellations of trust, and the tables were anchored by songs forgotten on shore. <words>114</words>
To map the guests, I sampled tiny plates of preserves, by tasting subtle differences in old jam recipes and listening for the stories they unlocked. <words>139</words>
A tart thread of blackcurrant could inflame a widow into laughter, while the gentler quince invited a sailor to weep. <words>159</words>
I recorded these tides in a notebook sealed from splash, though the pages trembled when the floor stones tilted. <words>178</words>
Every time a cloud passed and the house sank a finger deeper into mist, my old diving panic rose, a bell tightening around my ribs. <words>203</words>
I had learned to breathe through it underwater, counting bubbles to distance, but here I counted cups, spoons, and names. <words>223</words>
The proprietor noticed and rested her hand on the railing, and the tremor in the room changed key, like a chord resolving. <words>245</words>
Her healing touch did not occur as spectacle, only as a warmth that invited my breath to unfold. <words>263</words>
She asked what drove me, and I told her I was here to study human behaviors, because the ocean keeps its secrets quiet and so do people until sweetness finds the right door. <words>296</words>
She nodded, polished my pair of wire-rimmed glasses with a napkin, and said the trick was to taste for sorrow that wanted company. <words>319</words>
The walls creaked, the ceiling lanterns tilted, and a boy at the far table winced as if an anchor had caught his heart. <words>342</words>
His mother clutched his wrist too tightly, trying to inflame a lesson into him that instead hardened like overcooked sugar. <words>362</words>
I brought them toast and three jams, and asked them to taste with me, each spoonful a question about what they remembered. <words>384</words>
When the boy chose the bitter orange, he admitted he feared narrow spaces too, and the mother blinked at the word fear as though it were new. <words>411</words>
The proprietor rested her palm near, not touching, and in that gap the room grew wider, and I watched the boy loosen like a knot tasting rain. <words>438</words>
I recorded that the smallest mercies begin in the mouth, travel through the skin, and end as a healing touch that proves distance is a choice. <words>464</words>
In that quietly bold ledger, my claustrophobia softened, and the tea house settled to its orbit like a heart learning a kinder tide. <words>487</words>
