I arrived at the sky reflection pool with cautious impulsiveness humming in my pulse like dragonflies trapped under glass. <words>19</words>
Clients call me a femme fatale heartbreak counselor, the woman hired to seduce lies into confessing their true, aching names. <words>39</words>
After the invention of time travel, heartbreak blurred across centuries, and my practice adjusted, gently and ruthlessly, to its tides. <words>59</words>
I am restlessly curious, but I have learned to keep curiosity walking in soft shoes beside the precipice. <words>77</words>
Tonight the pool mirrored a bruised dusk, where cloud-currents looped like ink strokes teaching the sky to write forgotten oaths. <words>97</words>
I found my client by tracking cloud trails across the water, a cartography of vapor mapping every desire to its weight. <words>118</words>
He stood barefoot, wearing regret like a wet coat, and beside him lay a weathered suitcase he did not dare zip. <words>139</words>
Inside the open case glowed my missing amber earrings, catching dusk within them like mosquito souls caught mid-thirst. <words>157</words>
I had worn them to listen, because amber knows the gravity of desires, holding ancient pull in small suns near the ear. <words>179</words>
He confessed he stole time to steal me, and stole me to steal back time, yet ended owning only spirals. <words>199</words>
His wife had visited my office three years from now, bringing a marriage already broken tomorrow, asking me to soften the landing. <words>221</words>
I agreed then to meet him here now, because paradox is a cage of illusions, and I wanted to proclaim myself free in a cage of illusions. <words>248</words>
Freedom, however, is heavy; the gravity of desires drags at ankles, drags at tongues, drags at every false star we chase. <words>269</words>
So I told him the first rule of healing hearts: we do not keep what we stole from our own ache. <words>290</words>
Return the earrings, return the future, and face the pool, where the sky remembers what guilt forgets and mercy mispronounces. <words>310</words>
He asked whether I could love him across timelines, a plea flipping like a fish, silvery, desperate, bright with drowning. <words>330</words>
I touched the amber, felt the fossilized summer of extinct trees, and heard the whisper that curiosity without compass becomes hunger. <words>351</words>
So I kissed his forehead, a benediction, and guided his hands to zip the suitcase, closing the chapter he feared ending. <words>372</words>
Then we walked the perimeter, by tracking cloud trails until the map resolved, and I sent him toward the hour he abandoned. <words>394</words>
I stayed to watch the pool steady, my reflection aligning with the returned earrings, and I measured the tide receding inside me. <words>416</words>
What is a femme fatale if not a mirror that refuses to flatter, a counselor unafraid to let longing hear its echo? <words>438</words>
I left the pool wearing caution like silk and impulsiveness like boots, stepping forward, free enough to feel gravity and choose anyway. <words>460</words>
