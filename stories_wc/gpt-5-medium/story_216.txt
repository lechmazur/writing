I am a professional scapegoat for hire, and business thrives in the cloud city where blame condenses like weather. <words>19</words>
After the last library card gets returned to the desk, my shift begins, quiet as fog yet exacting as a ledger. <words>40</words>
I walk the aerial stacks strung between towers, gathering rumors like loose filings, patient with an obsessive calm that unspools hesitation. <words>61</words>
The clients reach me through cryptic phone calls at midnight, their voices compressed by altitude, their confessions studded with dates, codes, omissions. <words>83</words>
They hire me to receive blame and redirect scrutiny, but my private motive is to decode sacred symbols hidden inside their lies. <words>105</words>
Each symbol promises an abandoned identity, a name shed like vapor, a life refashioned into narrative heat that powers the city machinery. <words>127</words>
I collect these castoff selves with the care of a watchmaker, robustly delicate, resisting the urge to hurry the healing of fictions. <words>149</words>
Tonight a courier leaves a metal washer on the counter, polished bright as a halo, punctured with minuscule etchings only visible against lamplight. <words>172</words>
I spin it, and the vibration maps a faint rhythm across my fingerbones, an index to the library of vanished culpabilities. <words>193</words>
The washer is both key and lock, robustly delicate again, sturdy enough for sky-wind yet subtle enough to whisper a second grammar. <words>215</words>
Midnight thins to one o'clock when the next call arrives, the voice claiming innocence while offering coordinates that hover just beyond municipal maps. <words>238</words>
I follow along skybridges, over sleep-choked boulevards, toward a maintenance cupola where the storm tethers hum like monks studying their breath. <words>259</words>
There, a ledger waits wrapped in vellum, pages cut from weather reports, margins pricked with dots that align only when the washer spins. <words>282</words>
I refashion the ledger into a scroll, threading the washer through slits and turning the wind into a patient reader of silence. <words>304</words>
The cryptic calls were scaffolding; the true instructions bloom here, a geometry of guilt reassignments that points toward the library's skylight like a compass. <words>328</words>
I understand then that every borrowed book leaves a smudge on a soul, and my profession is to bear the graphite without complaint. <words>351</words>
But beneath the smudges lies a palimpsest of sacred symbols spelling my own abandoned identity, which the city repurposed to float its glorious secrecy. <words>375</words>
I feel no panic, only that obsessive calm, as I rotate the washer and watch the markings resolve into my childhood monogram. <words>397</words>
The cloud city breathes around me, robustly delicate, and I return to the desk to wait for the final card of myself. <words>419</words>
When it arrives, I sign the blame line, decode the last symbol, and step into the sky, refashioned yet recognizably whole. <words>440</words>
