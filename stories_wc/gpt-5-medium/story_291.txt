While the orchard cat dozes beneath a dying tree, I step into the haunted amusement park mirror maze. <words>18</words>
I am a daring ship captain ashore for answers, mapping reflections as if they were coasts. <words>34</words>
At my belt swings a frayed coil of rope from a prison escape I once survived. <words>50</words>
The maze breathes a calculated wilderness of glass, lights, and hidden speakers that imitate heartbeats. <words>65</words>
I am here to stand guard over your own spark of defiance, which prejudice has tried to smother with fog. <words>85</words>
I listen for guidance through strange cosmic echoes that ricochet between the mirrors like unseen gulls. <words>101</words>
Each echo carries a memory the living overlook, a breadcrumb trail left by those who never found the exit. <words>120</words>
In the world beyond the gates, sailors like me are called foreign ghosts, blamed for every storm and shortage. <words>139</words>
But these mirrors accuse everyone equally, confounding the pretty and the pious with the same distortions. <words>155</words>
So I move with a deliberately accidental swagger, feigning confusion to lure the malice that hunts certainty. <words>172</words>
When a pane hums wrong, I loop the stolen rope around a rail and test the path the way sailors test wind. <words>194</words>
Through the echoes I hear wardens, judges, and childhood whisperers, their verdicts rippling into silhouettes that try to bar my way. <words>215</words>
They say the captain is a thief of tides, a mongrel of maps, unfit to command more than an empty bottle. <words>236</words>
I answer by setting a course only conscience could chart, letting my reflection march ahead like a forward scout. <words>255</words>
Outside, while the orchard cat dozes beneath a dying tree, the night hushes its engines and waits. <words>272</words>
Inside, I find the heart of the maze, a rotating chamber where every pane reflects me as a different verdict. <words>292</words>
One reflection is shackled, one wears captain ribbons, one bleeds rust, and one smiles like the judge who once sold tickets here. <words>314</words>
I tie the rope to the center spindle and spin the chamber until the echoes harmonize, a compass made of dissonance. <words>335</words>
Through that strange music, I confront their chorus, not by pleading, but by naming the currents that once carried me to prison and back. <words>359</words>
I tell them how a storm refuses to choose a favorite roof, how a horizon opens to anyone stubborn enough to keep sailing. <words>382</words>
The mirrors begin to overlook their own tricks, smoothing until the versions merge, and I am simply the one who will not kneel. <words>405</words>
I coil the rope, its fibers warm from friction and memory, and stash it for whatever gate requires a deliberately accidental key. <words>427</words>
Then I walk out beneath the thin stars, captain of a vessel made of breath and will, charting exits through strange cosmic echoes. <words>450</words>
The orchard cat stretches in its sleep as if hearing a tide turn, and the dying tree drops a leaf like a tiny flag of surrender. <words>476</words>
