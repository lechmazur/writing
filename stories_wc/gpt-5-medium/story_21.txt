I entered the forgotten city hall with the abrasive calm that my colleagues call diplomacy and my enemies mistake for surrender. <words>21</words>
Outside, protestors beat the day into quarters amid drum circles, but inside the corridors the air kept time with older bureaucratic ghosts. <words>43</words>
I carried a fox tail tassel from a bandit who left my brother bleeding and our treaty loosened like a poorly knotted tie. <words>66</words>
Vengeance had a scent, I discovered, through the faint scent of must in a shuttered children’s theater stitched to the annex by dead wiring. <words>90</words>
The theater had been our town’s bright room; now it exhaled dust and programs for plays no parent remembered missing. <words>110</words>
In that must, I found a lab hobbled together from organically synthetic tubing, salvaged scanners, and a centrifuge calibrated by patience rather than manuals. <words>134</words>
I am a measured diplomat, yes, but I am also my brother’s keeper, and my calm has edges honed on treaties that failed. <words>157</words>
To decode genetic patterns from the tassel, I swabbed grit from its leather knot, a whisper of sweat, and stray hairs the wind spared. <words>181</words>
A clerk stumbled in and tried a jest about diplomats becoming janitors, but the machines answered with a low hum that discouraged laughter. <words>204</words>
Results emerged like a lantern raising its own wick, unspooling alleles that braided the bandit to a dozen children on our border villages. <words>227</words>
The price of revenge showed itself in those lines, a ledger of blood that would demand interest from small hands chalked in playground dust. <words>251</words>
If I traded the tassel for a bullet, I would buy applause from grief and bankrupt a future where their names might someday sit beside ours. <words>277</words>
Outside, the drums insisted, the city rasping its heartbeat through patched skins while council benches remembered speeches no one paid to hear anymore. <words>300</words>
I called the bandit to meet under the radon-stained mural of founders, my voice a steady file smoothing the serrations on my anger. <words>323</words>
He arrived with guards and the confidence of a man who thinks ghosts keep the minutes; I placed the tassel on the dais like evidence. <words>348</words>
I spoke in abrasive calm, offering him clemency for testimony, amnesty for the children, and public contrition he would sign before the drummers and cameras. <words>373</words>
He asked what it cost me, and I confessed that my revenge would be a quiet ledger entry, paid with the interest of lifelong restraint. <words>398</words>
The council recorded, the drums slowed, and I breathed the theater’s must again, thinking of children learning to speak without inheriting the bandit’s echo. <words>422</words>
I kept the tassel, not as a trophy, but as a hinge between what I could break and what I would choose to mend. <words>446</words>
