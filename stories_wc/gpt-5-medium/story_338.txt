I am a zany artificer cataloging echoes in the underground labyrinth of abandoned subway tunnels, personally detached yet industriously curious. <words>20</words>
The setting repeats itself with empty abundance, turnstiles without riders, posters without faces, tracks without trains, beauty without witness. <words>39</words>
Down here, when time folds in on itself, even dust arranges itself into patterns that feel like intentions. <words>57</words>
I carry a cracked phone case as a lens, holding it to lights so the fractures refract maps and rumors. <words>77</words>
People think artificers are hoarders of chaos, but I am here for order hidden in banal circuitry, breaking stereotypes gently. <words>97</words>
My motivation is to find beauty in the mundane, the quiet click of relays, the tidy seams of rust. <words>116</words>
The rotary phone waits on a plinth of cracked tiles, its dial face blind in places, its cord braided with dust. <words>137</words>
The call logs it shelters are incomplete, like constellations missing stars, but their gaps are coordinates I can travel. <words>156</words>
I inform the surface, not by broadcasting, but through the incomplete call logs of a rotary phone that refuses oblivion. <words>176</words>
Each number I dial is a missing digit, a silence instructing another silence, and the corridor answers with footfalls from tomorrow. <words>197</words>
Detachment helps; I observe, adjust, and listen as if calibrating rainfall, never drowning, never claiming the echoes as mine. <words>216</words>
Still, I leave offerings: washers arranged like moons, tokens aligned by serial number, a shrine of minor, empty abundance. <words>235</words>
I speak my report into the case's spidered plastic, and the case answers by splitting light into comprehensible diagrams. <words>254</words>
The diagrams travel the lines, resolve at other ends into memories of boots, gum wrappers, spilled coffee, a city thinking. <words>274</words>
On the far side of the fold, a child and an old conductor share the same receiver, and they listen differently. <words>295</words>
I inform them that beauty lives inside maintenance schedules, that courage looks like sweeping platforms no one names heroic. <words>314</words>
They inform me back, through the logs, by inserting gaps that smell of ozone, and I read the pauses like braille. <words>335</words>
Stereotypes curl up like ticket stubs; the zany artificer is not a bombast but a patient custodian of small signals. <words>355</words>
Personally detached, I am free to be accurate, to measure beauty without possession, to let the tunnels keep their names. <words>375</words>
When time folds again, the rotary shudders, and the case in my hand blossoms with cracks that look like cartography. <words>395</words>
I mark an exit no longer used, and the city arrives as patient light. <words>409</words>
Through the logs I inform everyone, and no one, that empty abundance is full enough. <words>424</words>
