<story>
I poled the gondola through weed choked lanes toward the swamp fortress that waited like a lantern without flame. <words>19</words>
Before the universe begins, time feels like a rope I can coil and unknot with my strangely honest fingertips. <words>38</words>
I am an incognito aristocrat, stripped of crest and coronet, yet heavy with debts I owe to untold listeners. <words>57</words>
They are the village, not yet born, whose stories must be saved against the coming gravity of authority. <words>75</words>
I came to chronicle village stories by listening to muddy reeds and naming the beasts that wander the fog. <words>94</words>
The fortress is reachable only by gondola, because the ground around it refuses to become anything but hunger. <words>112</words>
Inside, I found a rustic yarn swift, weathered as a moonless oar, turning all by itself in patient circles. <words>131</words>
Each spoke clicked like a syllable, insisting that twisted strands remember their path and speak when the first dawn arrives. <words>151</words>
In the chapel of reeds, a governor of fog kept books of silence and tried to subjugate the marsh with laws. <words>172</words>
He had no face, only wax that remembered commands, and he forbade the telling of anything that did not praise him. <words>193</words>
My defiance was humble, because I came not to rule but to ferry truths no throne could anchor. <words>211</words>
I sent messages in vintage wine bottles upstream, each bottle bearing a story wound upon the yarn swift like a hymn. <words>232</words>
These stories told of laborers who sow light into mud, and of midwives who hear constellations crying through cattails. <words>251</words>
Whenever the governor grabbed a bottle, the glass sang his true name, which was No More Orders Than Are Needed. <words>271</words>
Because I am strangely honest, I signed each tale with the mask I wear, and the mask named his cruelty clearly. <words>292</words>
He ordered my arrest, yet the marsh unbuttoned around my gondola, letting me glide through narrow letters the night had written. <words>313</words>
I reached the keep and tied the yarn swift to the altar so its turning could weave a raft of sentences. <words>334</words>
The raft sailed the future backward, carrying bottles to the unborn village, who will find them on shores they have not made. <words>356</words>
When the universe finally agrees to begin, rumor will reach the governor that praise tasted better when he listened first. <words>376</words>
Meanwhile, here, before the universe begins, I keep spinning the stories, challenging authority one bottle at a time, and waiting softly. <words>397</words>
The lantern without flame warms us anyway. <words>404</words>
