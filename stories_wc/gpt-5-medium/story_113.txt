I was a hesitant bard, tuned for triumph yet always arriving with apologies. <words>13</words>
My voice was shyly loud, like a secret shouted into a velvet sack. <words>26</words>
That night, at the crossing of a year everyone would rather forget, I entered the xenon-lit tunnel under the sleeping city. <words>47</words>
I carried a worn-out dinosaur plush that kept my courage from wandering off. <words>60</words>
Its stuffing wheezed with my steps, a pocket meteorology of lint storms and stubborn faith. <words>75</words>
In the tunnel waited the dream-hopping machines, caskets of chrome humming like lecturing bees. <words>89</words>
I had promised the council I would motivate the city via dream-hopping machines, verse by nerve, sleep by sleep. <words>108</words>
But my true errand was to unravel a tapestry woven from sorrow, a weave stitched through families like winter through pipes. <words>129</words>
They said the tapestry hung in the communal dream, where grief recited itself until lullabies grew hoarse. <words>146</words>
I strapped in, the dinosaur plush wedged against my ribs, a small Mesozoic parliament voting for bravery. <words>163</words>
Descent tasted like pennies and snow, and every light strobed the fragility of time across my eyelids. <words>180</words>
I landed in a plaza woven from naps and rumors, where clocks were taught to whisper their own endings. <words>199</words>
The tapestry rose, a skyline of knotted nights, and asked me for a story it could finally stop remembering. <words>218</words>
I began shy, then the shyly loud kernel inside me cracked open, and lyrics poured like bright glue to hold the broken calendar. <words>241</words>
I sang of the worn-out dinosaur plush and the hand that once mended it, now shaking but steady in love. <words>261</words>
I sang of deadlines that died and were buried beside newborn promises, of the tunnel where anxiety photosynthesized into plans. <words>281</words>
The tapestry loosened, thread by thread, revealing faces I knew only from the city's long silences, each nodding with ironic awe. <words>302</words>
Yet every knot held a memory that could not be unpicked without undoing someone who still needed it. <words>320</words>
So I bargained, offering counter-melodies, letting grief keep its architecture while surrendering its weather. <words>334</words>
Storms calmed to gentle, seasonal mistakes, and the plaza exhaled the relieved sound a book makes when closed. <words>352</words>
Back in the machines, I woke with the dinosaur plush damp from borrowed tears, my heart tuned sharper than fear. <words>372</words>
The tunnel's xenon buzz now felt like applause calculating its taxes, practical and awkward but well meaning. <words>389</words>
I returned to the council, hesitant bard no longer hiding, and spoke the fragile mathematics of what I had learned. <words>409</words>
Time is not a river, I said; it is a quilt that aches where it stretches, and warms where it forgives. <words>430</words>
To motivate a city is to stitch with stories, and to let the stitches show, because hiding them invites tearing. <words>450</words>
They nodded, even the skeptics, as if hearing their childhoods paging through again with fewer paper cuts. <words>467</words>
When I stepped back into the tunnel, the year finally turned, and I bowed to its fragility without pretending it was strong. <words>489</words>
