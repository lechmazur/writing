After the final goodbye, I crawled from the sewer to the orchard amphitheater where branches form the seats. <words>18</words>
You won't believe me, but I am a wannabe philosopher, rarely honest, who sleeps with rats and wakes to echoes. <words>38</words>
My plan is humble, or so I claim: to rewrite the code of existence by studying what everyone steps over. <words>58</words>
I carry a punctured plastic cup that sips the world one slow drip, teaching patience more honestly than I do. <words>78</words>
Tonight the moon wrote ledger lines on the leaves, and the amphitheater looked like a harp tuned to fruit. <words>97</words>
I climbed the stage fashioned from tangled roots and announced office hours for explorations of the mundane. <words>114</words>
No one came, unless you count wind, who kept interrupting with applause that shed petals like confetti. <words>131</words>
So I began anyway, admitting and denying in the same breath, practicing a tone of candid deceit the trees respected. <words>151</words>
I worked through chilling bedtime stories about brooms, drains, coupons, and how a stain on tile is a star collapsing quietly. <words>172</words>
Each tale tried to humble the glamorous and enthrone the overlooked, so the night might revise its own index. <words>191</words>
Between stories, I drank from my leaking cup, letting it baptize my chin with a democracy of drops. <words>209</words>
You would ask why I left the sewer, and I would answer that exile is just plumbing for the heart. <words>229</words>
But truthfully, the rats graduated before me, whispering, Rewrite the code, professor, start with breath, then trash, then forgiveness. <words>248</words>
After the final goodbye they squeaked, I had nobody but my cup and the orchard that pretends to be a theater. <words>269</words>
I mapped the code of existence as a seating chart: ants in front row, moths mezzanine, a fox slouching in the gods. <words>291</words>
When the wind heckled, I confessed a lie and a lesson, that beginnings are potholes disguised as halos. <words>309</words>
It was not honest, but it was useful, and usefulness is the only oath a sewer philosopher can nearly keep. <words>329</words>
By midnight the cup gathered stories of its own, each hole a mouth retelling rain as if it were scripture. <words>349</words>
I promised the audience of branches that tomorrow I would descend again, catalog gutters, translate grates, and publish the biography of rust. <words>371</words>
If I am lying, it is only to keep you awake, because sleep holds the keys and I need your fingers. <words>392</words>
Together we will debug the smallest gesture, the shrug that spills salt, the glance that steers tides without admitting responsibility. <words>412</words>
Then, when dawn audits our claims, I will fold my theater back into leaves and walk home under streets, practicing honesty in echoes. <words>435</words>
