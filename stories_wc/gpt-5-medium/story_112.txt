<story>I am an aimless traveler arriving at the writing system archive in hush as a snowflake melts on warm skin.<words>20</words>
Mournful elation follows me like breath as doors whisper closed, and paper dust glitters, constellations of vanished tongues and kitchens.<words>40</words>
I have come to preserve indigenous recipes, carrying a faded floral handkerchief that once wrapped grandmother's ash-sweet corn and herbs.<words>60</words>
My memory is factually imaginative, mapping verifiable measures into mythic shapes so recipes breathe while staying exact as winter stars.<words>80</words>
By noting secret patterns in a dusty hopscotch board outside the entrance, I learn where the catalog hides forbidden syllabaries.<words>100</words>
Their chalked squares hold seeds of vigilance, teaching patient steps, pauses, and leaps that mirror the rhythm of ancestral stews.<words>120</words>
Inside the reading room, script rolls rustle like grasses, and heating vents exhale smoke, recalling nights beside a travel grill.<words>140</words>
I trace ligatures shaped like ladles, spines of fish, and cuts in plantains, glyph naming flavors I promised to keep.<words>160</words>
I open the faded floral handkerchief, letting flake touch wrist, in the hush as a snowflake melts on warm skin.<words>180</words>
Mournful elation rises, because the melting prints a map of vapor, directing me toward a locked cabinet labeled Experimental Orthographies.<words>200</words>
The hopscotch patterns correspond to its tumblers, so I skip a sequence across tiles, and the cabinet clicks into breath.<words>220</words>
Inside lie scrolls stained with chile oil and smoke, recipes our ancestors tucked into scripts when conquerors outlawed their kitchens.<words>240</words>
I set my grill on the stone sill, and grill a flatbread from pictographs, pressing dough with needles for memory.<words>260</words>
Factually imaginative, I measure with knotted strings, confirming exact heat by how letters curl, blackened tips imitating the fishbones script.<words>280</words>
These are the seeds of vigilance, spice seeds too, saved through lullabies, and I scatter onto the bread like constellations.<words>300</words>
I write the method to preserve indigenous recipes, no substitutions, because accuracy carries grief and joy like drums across distances.<words>320</words>
Aimless traveler no longer fits, yet wandering remains my craft, because every community asks for measures, and listening requires movement.<words>340</words>
When the guard appears, coughing at smoke, I fan air with handkerchief and offer bread stamped with syllables of rain.<words>360</words>
He tastes, eyes watering, then unlocks a stair where elders gathered, and points to more hopscotch boards etched into floor.<words>380</words>
We eat in mournful elation, while snow, ink, and smoke braid above us, and vigilance seeds itself into tomorrow's kitchens.<words>400</words></story>
