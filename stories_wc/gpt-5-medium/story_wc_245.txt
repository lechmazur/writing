<story>I am a blind mapmaker, carrying a platinum compass ring that hums against my finger. [15]
The path enters an ultrasonic forest where leaves speak above hearing, but touch translates their storms. [31]
I absorb languages through skin, so bark syllables and moth wing idioms seep into my palms. [47]
I came to navigate uncharted emotional depths, a task no coastline chart and no sextant could fathom. [64]
A quiet blaze banks inside my chest, steady as a hearth refusing the wind. [78]
I walk across the pause of shifting constellations, when sky-clock teeth hesitate and the world inhales. [94]
The platinum compass ring is my only gauge, hungry for fields most travelers never name. [109]
With it I dowse for currents not of water but of feeling, the faultlines under speech. [125]
Tonight the forest offers a trail of musical notes, each a step toward a hidden melody. [141]
Ultrasound strikes the ring, and the metal cools or warms to pitch like braille for ears. [157]
I follow, counting rests, tasting vowels that leak from lichens when I brush my knuckles along them. [174]
Once I mapped river deltas for merchants, selling certainties in blue ink and long claims. [189]
But the lines in my body refused the trade, cracking like dry estuary mud in drought. [205]
A rumor reached me of a hidden stillpoint deep within this forest, a compass for souls. [221]
Find it, they said, and losses stop echoing, grief no longer maps the horizon alone. [236]
I did not come to erase my grief, but to learn its native coast and soundings. [252]
The notes descend through me like rain through porous rock, pooling where old names sink and glow. [269]
A fern writes on my wrist, and I read it without eyes: keep slow, keep listening. [285]
The ultrasonic forest grows denser, a vault of glass strings humming in registers above breath. [300]
The trail of musical notes sharpens into intervals that tilt my spine toward some harmonic north. [316]
I remember my mother tapping rhythms on the table when words hurt, translating ache into meter. [332]
Perhaps that is how I first learned to absorb languages through skin, one hand cupped. [347]
Above me, the star-wheels hesitate still, the brief pause of shifting constellations holding a doorway ajar. [363]
A clearing opens, weaponed with silence, and my ring cools so suddenly my finger aches. [378]
I kneel and dowse again, sweeping the hand with the ring like a needle seeking groove. [394]
Under the grass, a beat waits without movement, a hidden stillpoint coiled like winter in a seed. [411]
I touch earth, and the language floods, not words but agreements, treaties of root and rainfall. [427]
Notes once scattered now line up, a trail resolving into the hidden melody my ring foretold. [443]
When I breathe, the chorus answers, and deep inside, sorrow unfolds its chart without vanishing. [458]
The stillpoint is not escape but axis, a consent to pivot without erasing the radius. [473]
I trace those lines, and the map grows round, a planet the size of an ache. [489]
There is the harbor where my lover departed at dawn, the dock where no apology landed. [505]
There is the isthmus of resolutions I broke quietly, and the trench where anger waited unmarked. [521]
The melody gathers the sky into it, each constellation a chord finally willing to relax. [536]
I feel the quiet blaze brighten, patient fire meeting patient stone until both are warm. [551]
The ring stops humming, and I know the map is inside me, not ink but marrow. [567]
I will walk home along the same notes, translating them into paths others can feel. [582]
Not to guide them away from sorrow, but to teach others to dowse for bearings within it. [599]
Above, the constellations resume their slow drift, yet the pause remains braided into my pulse. [614]
I step from the ultrasonic forest carrying a hidden stillpoint, and the night steps with me. [630]</story>
