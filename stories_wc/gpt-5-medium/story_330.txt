<story>The dejected knight drifted alone in the zero-gravity dance hall, orbiting chandeliers like a dim satellite. <words>16</words>
Far above, an old watchtower clock struck an unexpected hour, and the room inhaled a hush. <words>32</words>
He clutched a trident prong from a sunken realm, its salt scars glittering like unwept tears. <words>48</words>
He had come to voice a silent vow echoing through ages, a promise few remembered but many needed. <words>66</words>
The ritual demanded sacred disorder: a waltz with no floor, a confession with no air to carry it. <words>84</words>
Here, horizons deepened without edges, deepening horizons that folded the cosmos inward like an origami tide. <words>100</words>
He was normally abnormal, armored in contrariness, a paradox that chimed truer than ordinary solace. <words>115</words>
He had reached this impossible ballroom through forgotten paths, stairwells that curled into memory and drift. <words>131</words>
When the clock stuttered again, time seemed to quicken, then loosen, as if the mechanism learned to breathe. <words>149</words>
He floated in slow turns, remembering a battlefield where he froze, letting dawn die on a helpless village. <words>167</words>
Since then, he had worn his helm like a shroud, dejected yet stubborn, seeking a way to atone. <words>185</words>
The trident prong hummed; from the sunken realm it had carried sea-oaths, barnacled whispers hungry for breath. <words>202</words>
He began a measured dance, tracing sigils with his boots, letting buoyant spins carve script in floating dust. <words>220</words>
Then the old watchtower clock struck the unexpected hour, and the chandeliers rang like submerged bells. <words>236</words>
Through the newly opened quiet, forgotten paths revealed themselves as currents, tugging him toward ancestral undertow. <words>252</words>
He followed, and the walls rippled, unfurling deepening horizons where constellations became doorways and remorse became wind. <words>269</words>
He touched the prong to the clockface, and the note it birthed filled the hall with luminous tide. <words>287</words>
He spread his arms to voice a silent vow echoing through ages, shaping breathless words that the sea would carry. <words>307</words>
Spectral dancers gathered, normally abnormal patrons of the void, and their mute applause stirred the chandeliers into auroras. <words>325</words>
I vow, he mouthed, to stand where tides break cruel, to guard harbors of the living and drowned alike. <words>344</words>
The prong flared, the room's pulses quicken and slow, stitching his failings into a net that would not tear. <words>363</words>
Time rehung itself, and the dejected knight found ballast, held up by sacred disorder like a raft of light. <words>382</words>
The watchtower hands pointed at an hour that never existed, yet the hall emptied of regret and filled with promise. <words>402</words>
He drifted outward through forgotten paths toward the waking world, his horizons deepening with every measured breath. <words>419</words>
He kept the trident prong as a compass, the watchtower clock now sounding in his chest with tidal patience. <words>438</words>
And whenever the unexpected hour returns, he will quicken mercy, widen deepening horizons, and keep the vow fluent and alive. <words>458</words></story>
