<story>Underground, the mushroom farm hums with a frantic peace I half trust. <words>12</words>
I am a skeptical gambler running chow for workers and waifs. <words>23</words>
Tonight we test marinades and memories amid recipe testing, steam threading the concrete lungs. <words>37</words>
I came here to guide lost travelers to safety, though I never say it plainly. <words>52</words>
They find the farm through maintenance doors, following my chalk arrows and kitchen smells. <words>66</words>
I choose routes by interpreting cryptic scrawls on subway seats, a cartographer of graffiti and dread. <words>82</words>
My uncharted grief keeps the map honest, a dark current that knows every leak. <words>96</words>
Years ago a brother gambled on a shortcut and vanished into power-torn night. <words>109</words>
Since then, truthfully lying, I promise miracles only when they are impossible to refuse. <words>123</words>
I tell them the air will sweeten ahead, and it does, because mushrooms breathe. <words>137</words>
But I never mention the dead zones where the grow lights fritz like bad hands. <words>152</words>
On my station sits a collection of dried petals, brittle maps of winters survived. <words>166</words>
I turn them as I stir, each crease a detour, each color a warning bell. <words>181</words>
When officers descend to impound unlicensed boilers, I smile and ladle consolation stew. <words>194</words>
They cannot catalog aroma, so the paperwork fogs, and the travelers slip behind crates. <words>208</words>
I am skeptical of luck but fluent in odds, and mercy pays in whispers. <words>222</words>
One boy arrives shaking, clutching a metro map erased by rain and fear. <words>235</words>
I read his future in the petals, then triangulate it with seat-scratch riddles. <words>248</words>
Go left past the oyster bins, I tell him, and do not thank me yet. <words>263</words>
He asks why I help, and I shuffle my cards to buy a heartbeat. <words>277</words>
Because the house always takes, I say, and I am stealing back the lost. <words>291</words>
He nods, believing the lie that is truer than silence, and runs for light. <words>305</words>
Steam beads the ceiling, peppering the stalactites we rigged from drip lines and tin. <words>319</words>
The recipes want patience, but hunger shouts, so I plate futures with buttered chanterelles. <words>333</words>
Every serving buys one more minute to reorganize panic into a corridor of calm. <words>347</words>
Frantic peace is a rhythm you cook to, wrists steady, heart sprinting ahead. <words>360</words>
In the lull I count petals, naming the uncharted griefs they map: mine, yours, ours. <words>375</words>
I will never chart my brother, but every safe exit is a rumor of him. <words>390</words>
So I dice, stir, and wager the night, under the city, under the odds. <words>404</words>
When the last traveler returns with a thanks he cannot swallow, I accept anyway. <words>418</words>
I am truthfully lying again, pretending I worked for food alone, not for absolution. <words>432</words>
In the soaking pans, petals soften, and I press them into a new, breathing map. <words>447</words>
Tomorrow the officers will return to impound something measurable, but not the way out. <words>461</words>
I will read the seats again, gather my travelers, and deal them a door. <words>475</words>
Everyone knows this underground mushroom farm shelters truth better than the streets above. <words>488</words></story>
