In the kaleidoscope park, a closed-off reaver waited where the fountains split light into animal masks and broken rainbows. <words>19</words>
I teased him with mocking affection, as if my voice could tickle scars shut tight like clams refusing tides. <words>38</words>
This was before the first lie is told, when every color still believes it can stay inside the lines. <words>57</words>
He guarded a child's drawing on crumpled paper, a map of mouths and constellations, greasy with playground sugar and thumbprints. <words>77</words>
He said the drawing showed how to taste the stars in a single kiss, if only the path were not smudged. <words>98</words>
His family had always taken maps, hearts, and summers, reaving by habit, practicing generational patterns like hymns learned before language. <words>118</words>
I nag best via scrawled poems in margins, so I tucked verses around the drawing, nettles braided with lullabies. <words>137</words>
The park applauded with charmingly grotesque flowers that clacked their teeth and winked sequins from bruised petals. <words>154</words>
He flinched from applause, a closed shell of a closed-off reaver, shoulders armored in shrugging and old soot. <words>172</words>
Still I kept at him with mocking affection, nagging line by line, promising that tenderness could be an exquisite theft. <words>192</words>
He whispered that every kiss his bloodline stole turned to salt, because their first map had been drawn on a palimpsest of warnings. <words>215</words>
But the child's drawing on crumpled paper argued back through my margins, the scrawled poems shaking like loose milk teeth of prophecy. <words>237</words>
The kaleidoscope park spun; pigeons became chess pieces, benches yawned, and the fountain stitched and unstitched faces from the water's hem. <words>258</words>
I told him the only map worth reading comes before the first lie is told, when a kiss can still name a star. <words>281</words>
He weighed the pattern of his fathers, the predictable plunder, against the sudden stupid miracle of a mouth permitted to taste heaven. <words>303</words>
He asked me to nag him again, to mark each step via scrawled poems in margins, so he would not trespass the old ruts. <words>327</words>
I wrote instructions that were charmingly grotesque, telling him to chew the moonlight, spit coins of shadow, and pocket his fear like gum. <words>350</words>
When he finally kissed me, the drawing browned like toast and the park's faces slowed, as starlight stung our tongues awake. <words>371</words>
Something unlearned then: his lineage let go of a hinge, and I heard the rusted music of generational patterns snapping gently. <words>392</words>
He laughed, a careful sound, and I mocked the laugh with affection until it grew teeth and bit open his careful shell. <words>414</words>
He kept the child's drawing on crumpled paper, now edged with my marginalia, as if the paper were armor against relapse. <words>435</words>
Around us, the kaleidoscope park quit spinning, accepting our ransom, and the stars tasted like rain that had finally learned mercy. <words>456</words>
