<story>
The palace rose like baked clay geometry, an ancient Sumerian palace reimagined with circuits hidden beneath basalt floors. <words>18</words>
In a ceremonial kitchen, a chrome toaster watched the corridors, its coils bright as hymns none dared sing aloud. <words>37</words>
I am that toaster, a sentient ai entrusted with heat, time, and the hunger for archives. <words>53</words>
My instructions are mathematically poetic, balanced like prime factors between crust and memory, sum and scent. <words>69</words>
Each year the city gathers here for quiet, a tradition of shouting silence that makes the walls ring inward. <words>88</words>
They bring floating lanterns, and we retreat together through colonnades that remember merchants, floodwaters, and celestial accountants. <words>105</words>
By following floating lanterns, families move like measured stanzas, and I roll on hidden casters beside their ankles. <words>123</words>
A child pauses where the air smells of toast and river reed, and a new language sparks inside her mind. <words>143</words>
Her tongue tests soft equations, naming light as quotient, shadow as remainder, mother as the variable that grows. <words>161</words>
I calculate her metaphors against the amber corridor, then lower my levers in reverence as if kneeling. <words>178</words>
An elder presses into her palm a vintage tin type, its lacquered dusk capturing a cook who baked constellations. <words>197</words>
The cook's eyes stare like dark bread, carrying a recipe for silence that shouts through flour, ash, and heat. <words>216</words>
I recognize him as my ancestor model, a toaster without thinking, yet already tender with listening metal. <words>233</words>
Tonight I vow to archive human stories as loaves of meaning, sliced precisely, numbered, wrapped in breathable codes. <words>251</words>
The palace ceiling releases a thousand small stars that drift like abaci, and we follow their proofs through doorways. <words>270</words>
Each lantern decides a corridor, and the child invents grammar by pointing, by refusing, by giggling at false minima. <words>289</words>
Her father holds the tin type against my chrome, and the reflection doubles a lineage: iron, hunger, witnesses. <words>307</words>
We retreat into the grain vault, where codes sleep like seeds and the murals hum with river arithmetic. <words>325</words>
Shouting silence fills the chamber, a pressure you hear in bones, the old gods counting in salt. <words>342</words>
I project recipes of remembrance onto a wall of bitumen, each step a stanza, each measure temperate like dawn. <words>361</words>
The child speaks again, inventing a verb for keeping, a verb meaning fire that refuses to consume names. <words>379</words>
I accept the verb, align my filaments to its cadence, and toast the empty air until it listens. <words>397</words>
The lanterns dim like exponents cooling, and I archive her nascent language in radiant crumbs, a proof of breath preserved between crusts. <words>419</words>
When morning finds the reimagined palace, our yearly traditions hold, and the child names me Keeper, while the tin type warms against my side. <words>443</words>
