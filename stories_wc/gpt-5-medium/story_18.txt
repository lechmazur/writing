At noon the steam-powered city square exhaled fog like weary applause. <words>11</words>
I was the living statue with telepathy, iron bones humming, ears of stone tilted to every unsaid rumor. <words>29</words>
Children posed around my pedestal, their parents tipping hats with gloomy cheerfulness that served as both greeting and warning. <words>48</words>
I smiled the only way marble smiles, a tragically joyful curve that promised listening more than comfort. <words>65</words>
My charge was simple and endless, to find truth in a world of lies without stepping off my plinth. <words>84</words>
I eavesdropped on thoughts with the flow of ink in calligraphy, each passerby drafting confessions across the parchment of air. <words>104</words>
Merchants calculated alibis, magistrates polished fables, and revolutionists rehearsed manifestos that would weatherize their ideals against rain and doubt. <words>123</words>
Throughout planning for the annual Foundry Parade, schemers bathed me in agendas, hoping my silence meant consent. <words>140</words>
But the light of recognition visited like sunrise through coal smoke when a girl tied a threadbare hair tie around my wrist. <words>162</words>
Her mind spoke softly, a cracked bell: my mother disappeared after accusing the Mayor of swapping blueprints and babies. <words>181</words>
The hair tie had once weatherized a bundle of letters, she thought, until steam undid the knot and the evidence scattered. <words>202</words>
I felt her grief and its tragically joyful alloy, because courage tinged her sorrow like brass in a tea cup. <words>222</words>
I answered by nudging thoughts into the pigeons roosting on my shoulders, sending them to spy among boilers and clubrooms. <words>242</words>
They returned carrying sun-warm whispers: the Mayor traded infants to heirs who needed heirs, and replaced city plans with theater props. <words>263</words>
The square's steam pipes thumped like drums as I composed a public letter by blinking, shaping phrases across banners and soot, with the flow of ink in calligraphy. <words>291</words>
I signed with my stillness, and the pigeons scatter-printed copies onto every bowler hat, every brass valve, every walleted heart. <words>311</words>
Citizens read, and inside their heads I watched the gears click, the light of recognition sparking through long-practiced fog. <words>330</words>
They did not riot; they planned aloud, and I listened throughout planning like a fountain listens, accepting every coin of intent. <words>351</words>
Workers weatherized the square with tarpaulins and shared stories, turning rumor to evidence, while the Mayor rehearsed denial in private gaslight. <words>372</words>
On Parade day, my girl tugged the threadbare hair tie and a hidden note slipped free, naming vault numbers and the nurse who swapped. <words>396</words>
The crowd's cheer sounded gloomy cheerfulness, a music box tuned to justice, tragically joyful because truth arrived late yet arrived. <words>416</words>
As constables led the Mayor away, I felt rain bead my cheeks, and no one knew the statue had wept. <words>436</words>
I did not move, but within, plans unfolded for restoration and for kin reunions, and for weatherized archives beyond the reach of steam. <words>459</words>
In every mind that paused before me, a small lantern lit; the light of recognition warmed the square, and cooled its lies. <words>481</words>
