The bookbinder with telekinetic powers arrived at the abandoned carnival prize booth, hands dusty, eyes bright, a strictly casual jacket hanging loose like a flag surrendering to evening. <words>28</words>
He carried a single chopstick wrapper tucked behind his ear, as if it were a quill from a bird that forgot how to sing. <words>52</words>
He had come to discover the power of transformation, though he kept his stance nonchalant, the stride of a man who reads storms but wears sneakers to the opera. <words>81</words>
The booth was bristling with silent plush tigers and glass fish, prizes that remembered children better than the towns that grew up and forgot their laughter. <words>107</words>
He placed the chopstick wrapper on the counter and willed the dust to swirl, arranging it into letters that spelled a caution he already knew by heart, the price of knowledge. <words>138</words>
Still, the price must be paid, he said softly, and the words lifted off the counter like moths fleeing a lamp they nonetheless worship. <words>162</words>
He listened for sound bites snared in the carnival bones, because his memories revived via sudden flashbacks triggered by sound bites, a trick his mind learned from time and ruin. <words>192</words>
A rusted bell clinked, and he saw a river that flowed uphill, paper boats carrying titles, spines, and stitched signatures, each book a fish turning into a wing. <words>220</words>
A snapped spring twanged, and he remembered a patron who asked him to bind a chronicle that stretched across the tapestry of lost legends without breaking. <words>246</words>
The booth, once a ledger of sugar and applause, hummed like it missed its own handwriting, and he felt the wrapper's paper edge tremble with purpose. <words>272</words>
He was strictly casual, but the air around his fingers grew ceremonial as he coaxed staples to unfurl and plywood to straighten, small revivals rehearsing a larger vow. <words>300</words>
He wanted not to hoard knowledge but to revive what was worthy, to stitch torn meanings into new spines that could bend and never break under longing. <words>327</words>
The chopstick wrapper unscrolled itself, letters rising in a quiet plume, revealing a menu for metamorphosis, with prices written in the currency of memories surrendered. <words>352</words>
Pay with the night you first mispronounced your name, it whispered, and gain vowels that open doors where walls once memorized their shadows. <words>375</words>
Pay with the way you folded apologies into margins, and gain thread that knows how to listen when a page aches for a chrysalis. <words>399</words>
He paid, and the booth exhaled, history folding toward tomorrow. <words>409</words>
A final ringtone from a lost phone chimed, and his power gathered like a tide, lifting the prizes until they remembered games meant becoming, not winning. <words>435</words>
He left the booth and its spectral ledger open to the wind, a living catalog that would travel across the tapestry of lost legends for those willing to pay and change. <words>466</words>
Behind him, the single chopstick wrapper settled like a bookmark in fate, proof that transformation reads us back as gently as we dare to read. <words>491</words>
