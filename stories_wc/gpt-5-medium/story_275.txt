I arrived at the ghostly orchard overshadowed by a burning comet, dragging a cart of jars, tools, and quiet faith. <words>20</words>
They call me a mysterious hermit, but I keep names like embers, nursed carefully, never fanned without cause. <words>38</words>
My motive is simple, stubborn, and tender: to coax life from barren ground while the heavens pretend indifference. <words>56</words>
The comet's hiss tatted lace in the dark, and the trees shook like thin-boned horses learning to trust. <words>74</words>
I opened my pressed flower album, each page a preserved vow, each margin annotated with weather, soil, and silence. <words>93</words>
These relics were not nostalgia; they were letters I needed to translate, addressed to the future orchard trembling beneath ash. <words>113</words>
I read them via the exact angle of a half-bent weathervane, because metal remembers what mouths forget. <words>130</words>
When the vane leaned north by northwest, I chose seeds; when it sighed south, I chose patience and a different shovel. <words>151</words>
Mindful choices were my only rebellion against entropy, theoretically rebellious yet disciplined as a monk counting breaths. <words>168</words>
Throughout moving between rows, I spoke aloud to roots, translating comet-light into measures of water, pause, and shelter. <words>186</words>
The ground answered with small refusals, then smaller acceptances, as though grief itself were learning a new grammar. <words>204</words>
I slept little, setting traps for frost and doubts, laying paths of ash my feet could read before dawn. <words>223</words>
In the album, a pressed viola from my mother's fence reminded me that rescue starts by listening without appetite. <words>242</words>
So I listened to the orchard's ghostly permutations: wasps bargaining with pears, sap considering courage, bark negotiating its scars. <words>261</words>
The comet lowered like a kiln-lid, and heat furred the night, a deliberate wilderness pacing my patience. <words>278</words>
A storm wandered near, its bones measured by thunder, and the weathervane twitched into an angle I had never recorded. <words>298</words>
The album fluttered open to an empty page, and I realized mindful choices sometimes mean choosing to witness, not to steer. <words>319</words>
So I stood very still, translating silence, and the words became furrows, and the furrows filled themselves with waiting. <words>338</words>
Dawn found sprouts cinched to soot, thin as eyelashes, yet balanced exactly where the vane had pointed during my tremor. <words>358</words>
Neighbors arrived, sure I was a fraud, but their calves slowed among the rows, and they listened despite themselves. <words>377</words>
I told them the orchard asked for steadiness, not spectacle. <words>387</words>
I showed the pressed flower album, its edges charred, its stories intact, and said each page was a contract signed in patience. <words>409</words>
Skepticism thinned when the youngest knelt, translating the wind with me, palms hovering above the soil like unlit lanterns. <words>428</words>
Together we read the weathervane, then planted our breaths beside the seedlings, and the orchard answered by remembering how to be alive. <words>450</words>
