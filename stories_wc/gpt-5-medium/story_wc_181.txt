<story>Between the first and last page of the ledger, the curator stood alone in the astral orchard blossoming on a lonely asteroid, checking the fruit for whispers. [27]
He was a bewildered curator by trade and temperament, hired to tend histories that grew on branches rather than in boxes. [48]
Each star-plum held a version of an event, each comet-peach another perspective, and the sum of harvests resembled nonlinear inheritance, the orchard remembering futures as well as pasts. [76]
He had come here to pursue forbidden knowledge, and the prospect brightened disquiet like a lantern raised within fog. [95]
The rules were simply complicated, carved into the basalt by earlier keepers who had confused clarity with abundance. [113]
Touch a fruit and you tasted the vision that sustained it, but touch two in the wrong order and your mind might braid a hazard. [138]
He carried in his pocket a pistachio shell cameo blank, scalped smooth by time, the sole inheritance from an aunt who had vanished mid-lecture. [162]
She taught him to inquire without end, and she taught him that objects could be hungry, which is why he fed the cameo rainwater and secrets. [188]
On the asteroid, bathrooms were tiny silver pods tucked among the roots, and he often retreated there, having philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms like astronauts do with orbiting epiphanies. [216]
Today, he locked a pod, flipped the cameo in his palm, and asked the mirror why the orchard felt like a book written by weather. [241]
The mirror showed a page rippling, then another, until the space between the first and last page thinned like a membrane and he saw his aunt walking there. [269]
She beckoned toward a tree whose fruits pulsed with a steady heartbeat, and he realized this was the forbidden grove that did not appear on the map. [296]
Rumor said its harvest contained causes that sought effects, and effects that grew their own causes, and anyone who sampled them would be rewritten. [320]
He left the pod with hands shaking, drawn by brightened disquiet and the cameo ticking like a tiny clock desperate to be a face. [344]
At the grove, he inquired of the tree the way he had been taught to inquire of patrons and dead authors, politely, with attention to what remained unsaid. [372]
The tree inhaled, a sound like tide in a seashell, and it whispered a rule he had never read: ask with your lineage, not your voice. [398]
He pressed the pistachio shell cameo blank to the bark, and lines rose upon it like veins filling with meaning, a portrait forming of no one yet. [425]
The orchard rustled as if pages turned, and a history not his rummaged through his bones, choosing features, grafting a gaze he had only seen in mirrors. [452]
He understood then that nonlinear inheritance was not only about bloodlines or books, but about what you let answer when the world asked you to speak. [478]
His aunt had stepped into the between, and now the between stepped into him, the cameo drawing her likeness out of the orchard into the open. [504]
Her face appeared in the cameo, unfinished, eyes a pair of uncarved holes that made him feel seen by possibility rather than by judgment. [528]
She told him, without words, to pick one fruit and eat, because the simplest complicity is to let others decide for you, and the way beyond is simply complicated. [557]
So he chose the dullest fruit, a puckered star-plum that smelled faintly of tap water, and he bit until its pit clicked against his teeth. [582]
A flood of scenes unfurled: a bathroom stall where a boy solved a paradox with a pen, a lecture where a woman vanished while explaining continuity. [608]
He saw himself years ago, having philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms because the tiles were patient and the fan made a wind that sounded like advice. [633]
Then he saw what he was not supposed to see, his aunt copying herself into the orchard through the cameo, not dying but being archived the way a question is, forever inquiring. [665]
The cameo warmed until it burned, and he pressed it into the tree, leaving the impression of an unfinished face, a promise to return and complete the inquiry. [693]
He walked back through the orchard, now hearing pages turn inside the fruit like tides, and he understood that his job was to curate the between. [719]
To inquire properly, he would need to teach his successors how to inherit out of order, to accept that the orchard would claim them in return. [745]
Behind him, the grove closed its leaves like covers, and ahead of him the silver pod gleamed, inviting him to wash his hands and think again. [771]
He smiled, bewildered and resolute, a curator at last, brightened disquiet guiding him through the pages that keep writing us as we read them. [795]</story>
