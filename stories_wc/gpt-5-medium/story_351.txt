The dreamy poet arrived at the disused railway station overgrown with ivy after the last riddle is solved, breath fogging in a quietly intense dusk. <words>25</words>
On the platform, a brass sundial lay tilted in gravel like a small sun waiting for a better century to compel its shine. <words>48</words>
He was formally rebellious, buttoned coat and scuffed shoes obeying rules only to gain the leverage of breaking them with grace. <words>69</words>
He had come to stand by the unremembered, whose names once rode outbound and never returned, leaving shoes of dust beneath the station benches. <words>93</words>
The letter in his pocket was unopened, its wax seal pressed into cryptic shapes, a map and an oath intertwined via cryptic shapes in the wax seal of an unopened letter. <words>124</words>
It had arrived from no sender, yet the curves and angles whispered that his task began where timetables had been scraped away. <words>146</words>
He placed the brass sundial atop a cracked step, aligning noon with the ghost of the ticket window, and shadows unfolded like careful fingers. <words>170</words>
The alignment solved nothing grand, yet it began a delicate undoing, as if the ivy itself loosened knots of time and rumor. <words>192</words>
He read the letter without opening it, tracing those embossed ridges to compel remembrance from silence, translating crease by crease. <words>212</words>
Names came first, then brief stations of their joys, every figure a passenger who had dissolved into rumor when the line was abandoned. <words>235</words>
He murmured their syllables to the winter air, the dreamy poet making a litany of lightly held things, so that holding would not hurt. <words>259</words>
From the tracks came a faint ringing, neither metal nor wind, a hush that felt like an answer walking barefoot. <words>279</words>
He understood then that the riddles had never been puzzles, only rehearsals of attention, and that after the last riddle is solved, attention must act. <words>304</words>
So he stood where luggage once clattered, and with the sundial as witness declared the station open for memory, a platform for the unremembered to arrive. <words>330</words>
The ivy rustled, releasing ticket stubs of light, and faces surfaced in panes, not to haunt, but to be counted and kept. <words>352</words>
He saw also the child he had once been, formally rebellious in posture, sneaking poems between rules, and he bowed to that stubborn boy. <words>376</words>
He knew that memory can break people, yet this was not a shattering, but an art of repair, a delicate undoing of forgetting. <words>399</words>
The station breathed, quietly intense, and the sundial caught a pale noon that arrived from no sun but from their return. <words>420</words>
