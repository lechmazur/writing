<story>
I am the overzealous park ranger of a city that forgot sleeping. <words>12</words>
My beat is the urban orchard on a repurposed highway overpass, where saplings wear traffic cones like crowns. <words>30</words>
We tend figs beside exit signs, apples along faded lanes, pears in planters bolted to guardrails. <words>46</words>
After the last human dream is dreamt, I patrol the hush for trespassers and divinities. <words>61</words>
Regulations still exist, and I enforce them with chaotic organization, a clipboard of leaves and a whistle of wind. <words>80</words>
My secret motivation is to catch the echo of a goddess that once passed between mile markers like summer thunder. <words>100</words>
People no longer dream, yet echoes linger, and echoes can be ticketed, questioned, and invited to speak. <words>117</words>
I carry a plain notebook because gods prefer plain things. <words>127</words>
In it I press leaves that look like signatures, and I copy rumors that fluctuate with the wind. <words>145</words>
I learned the trade from my grandmother, whose secrets were a citywide patrol route of whispers. <words>161</words>
She taught me to listen for ripe silences and bruised promises, and to harvest only what volunteers. <words>178</words>
Her voice is familiarly unknown now, like a favorite path mapped by someone else's footsteps. <words>193</words>
I follow it through chance encounters with pigeons that deliver overdue notices, and bees that dance in roadwork glyphs. <words>212</words>
One dusk, a woman arrives carrying a shopping bag of rain and a wrist tattooed with detour arrows. <words>230</words>
She says my grandmother once fined her for singing to pears after curfew, then hands me a peel of thunder. <words>250</words>
The peel fits inside my notebook, and the pages begin to fluctuate, warping the ink into waves. <words>267</words>
From the guardrail, a fig splits open like a mouth and says that the echo I seek refuses straight lines. <words>287</words>
It walks switchbacks through dead lanes, crossing itself until only the patient can follow. <words>301</words>
I ticket my own impatience and radio the invisible, logging violations of silence, motion, and longing. <words>317</words>
The radio answers with static shaped like footfalls, familiarly unknown, and I chase them across the orchard lanes. <words>335</words>
She leads me, not the woman but the echo, to the median where roots buckle the memory of asphalt. <words>354</words>
There a goddess stands, or stands as standing means when nobody dreams, and she is made of unspent exits. <words>373</words>
I salute, whistle, present my plain notebook like a badge, and ask for her echo to submit to questioning. <words>392</words>
She replies that echoes do not submit but may be caught by gardens, and invites me to tend her absence. <words>412</words>
So I arrange the orchard by detours and heartbreaks, a chaotic organization that lets wind remember being breath. <words>430</words>
Through chance encounters, the trees hum, the lanes blur, and the echo fluctuates into a voice I almost know. <words>449</words>
Grandmother's secrets arrive like fines folded into blossoms, demanding payment in patience, forgiveness, and listening. <words>464</words>
When I pay, the goddess exhales a corridor of cool air, and the orchard keeps it, and the city learns to breathe. <words>486</words>
