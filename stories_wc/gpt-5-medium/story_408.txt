I was a conscientious objector soldier before the orchard claimed me, and the ravine's storms taught me patience sharper than orders. <words>21</words>
Now I walk the hanging orchard as our neighborhood watch, valiantly bored and listening to the trees creak like old hinges. <words>42</words>
The ravine is battered by storms that rake the fruit, and the fruit remembers where the winds travel when people forget. <words>63</words>
Throughout craft fairs, when buskers tune up and vendors pin bunting to the wet rails, I collect their routes like apples in sleeves. <words>86</words>
I am xenial because strangers sing more when the tea is hot and the questions are gentle, and songs make maps without arguing. <words>109</words>
My grandfather taught that method as a family tradition related to a certain holiday we call Lantern Night, when we hang lit jars from boughs. <words>134</words>
The light draws migrants in ways a compass cannot, moths and birds and people alike, and their pauses grant us their invisible itineraries. <words>157</words>
I keep a rusty nail in my pocket for luck and for scratching clean lines onto cider crates, etching arcs where footsteps bend. <words>180</words>
It stains my thumb a mean red, and I like the mark because it looks like a small wound that never closes its eye. <words>204</words>
That is my coy malevolence, a private emblem that whispers keep counting, keep inviting, keep watching, even when the orchard seems asleep. <words>226</words>
The storms make neighbors skittish, so they formed the watch, and I organize it the way I once prepped patrols without carrying a rifle. <words>250</words>
We drift between stalls, we note the badges, we notice who avoids the lantern glow, and we redirect them with jokes and steaming cups. <words>274</words>
I am friendly to a fault, and fault lines tell you where the earth will break, which is to say where bodies prefer to travel. <words>299</words>
When storms stampede the ravine, we shelter vendors under the hanging orchard's scaffold, and our ears open like fruit splitting itself to sweetness. <words>322</words>
They tell us of border detours, broken bridges, and the secret bus that refuses the high road whenever the gulls wheel inland before dusk. <words>346</words>
I piece these murmurs together while pretending to guard pepper jelly and quilts, smiling as if commerce were my creed, not migration. <words>368</words>
A soldier's discipline survives even when he refuses to shoot, and my conscience keeps time with the rain rattling the jars above us. <words>391</words>
When the lanterns burn low on the holiday night, we raise a toast to departures, then mark on crates the swerves that homeward pilgrims prefer. <words>416</words>
The rusty nail sketches an arch between two towns, and a dotted line where the water rose last year and frightened the caravans. <words>439</words>
We say we are only a neighborhood watch, valiantly bored, but our orchard remembers every footfall, and my maps know where tomorrow is going. <words>463</words>
If ever the storms ask why we keep such xenial company, I will answer that routes need guardians who never aim, only listen and inscribe. <words>488</words>
