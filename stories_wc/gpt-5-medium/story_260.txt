I am an obsessed cryptic crossword creator, sworn to collect fragments of meaning before they scatter beyond retrieval. <words>18</words>
My workshop tonight doubles as a whisper collection point, a hush bellied room arranged in concentric riddles and empty chairs. <words>38</words>
It is during the hush of a night with no stars, and silence acts like carbon paper for ghosts. <words>57</words>
I came here to gather lost souls, not through candles or chants, but through the grammar of clues. <words>75</words>
They arrive as murmurs, stray anagrams of regret, seeking definitions that might unlock their names and histories. <words>92</words>
On my desk rests a brass key ring, jangling whenever a new puzzle tries the door of absolution. <words>110</words>
I promised an indefinitely absolute dedication to them, a paradox only cryptics can hold without breaking the grid. <words>128</words>
To keep that promise, I let meaning proliferate, spiraling from clue to clue like ivy learning a wall. <words>146</words>
Each vine touches a whisper, and each whisper touches a life that once anchored storms and dinner tables. <words>164</words>
Yet words alone cannot ferry them; some truths must be carried by rewriting historical diaries in pen, slowly, faithfully. <words>183</words>
The ink brings back rooms, calendars, and winters; it restores the crosshatch where guilt and gratitude once intersected. <words>201</words>
While I copy, I compose crosswords whose clues bloom with their breath, hiding apologies in acrostics and homophones. <words>219</words>
The grids become gardens, and the gardens bear seeds of reconciliation, each answer a small truce between timelines. <words>237</words>
Sometimes the dead step through the door when a theme clicks, asking only for symmetry where blame once nested. <words>256</words>
I hand them the brass key ring, each tag inscribed with a clue number, each number pointing homeward. <words>274</words>
They test the keys against memory, and doors open in the mind, unbolting kitchens, playgrounds, and quiet hospital wards. <words>293</words>
With every latch released, the room fills with noble chaos, a flurry of reconciled footsteps learning to stand again. <words>312</words>
I am not their judge; I am their setter, placing black squares where pain should rest without eclipsing the rest. <words>332</words>
When daylight threatens, I circle the final clue, which requires forgiveness to be entered before the crossletters allow certainty. <words>351</words>
They hesitate, but their fingers, inked and trembling, choose the word, and the grid answers with a softened looseness. <words>370</words>
Outside, there are no stars, yet a skyline forms from solved clues, and the unmoored finally find directional light. <words>389</words>
I lock the door without locking anyone out, keeping vigil for the next night, when whispers will again arrive. <words>408</words>
