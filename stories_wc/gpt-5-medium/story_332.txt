Between borrowed books, I drifted in the exo-atmospheric garden, a solitary painter harvesting light from orbiting vines. <words>17</words>
Everyone else had descended long ago, but I kept tending these chlorophyll constellations like heirlooms of unspoken departures. <words>35</words>
My hands were fiercely gentle, practiced at guiding fragile leaves through vacuum-tight lattices without bruising their brave translucence. <words>53</words>
In my sleeve slept a battered notepad, its corners cratered, its pages recording failures that ripened into pigments. <words>71</words>
I painted to speak across an intimate separation, not only from people, but from the planet murmuring blue beneath. <words>90</words>
The schedule of resupply aligned my days like stanza breaks, each pause measured between borrowed books from the station library. <words>110</words>
Inside those margins, I listened to oxygen pumps and the hushed applause of leaves learning the choreography of weightlessness. <words>129</words>
Sometimes the station theatre opened its curtains to emptiness, and I would sweep the stage for dust like orphaned comets. <words>149</words>
There, I learned to resuscitate failing plants through the hushed confessions scrawled behind stage curtains, notes from vanished botanists. <words>168</words>
Their handwriting trembled with microgravity and grief, margins full of equations that sagged like unused parachutes. <words>184</words>
I copied them into my battered notepad, translating sorrow into care, until sap rose like a sigh returning to lungs. <words>204</words>
These were my realms of surprise: seeds sprouting under starlight, paint that smelled like rain, memories that flowered when forgotten. <words>224</words>
Yet the garden grew heavier with unspoken returns, as if earthward gravity rehearsed itself inside every glossy leaf. <words>242</words>
I was painting a final triptych, three panels to reconcile departure, orbit, and the soft landing none could promise. <words>261</words>
The first panel held the theatre, curtains breathing, stage dark, my footsteps erased by chalked formulas asking forgiveness. <words>279</words>
The second kept the garden, vines looping constellations around my torso like courteous seatbelts that never really wanted release. <words>298</words>
The third waited blank, a space where I might learn to dare a final leap of faith and let gravity choose. <words>319</words>
But separation had become my instrument, its quiet fretboard tuned to the barely audible harmonics of leaving things alive. <words>338</words>
On the day the library recalled every book, my borrowed time narrowed to a ribbon, and I understood returning. <words>357</words>
I filled the blank panel with a corridor of curtains, their inner hems stitched with secrets that guided me homeward. <words>377</words>
Then I closed the theatre, watered the orbiting vines, and kissed the notepad shut, trusting the plants to remember. <words>396</words>
Outside, Earth lifted its blue eyelid, and surprise finally breathed. <words>406</words>
