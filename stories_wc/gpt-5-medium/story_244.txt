<story>After the final petal drops from the old rosebush, I return to the neon sign repair shop where my penance hums. <words>21</words>
The city knows me as a guilty swordswoman, retired but not absolved, careful as glass in the bluest midnight. <words>40</words>
I move with a reservedly bold patience, fixing tubes and letters while keeping my blade wrapped like a sleeping confession. <words>60</words>
Tonight, on the back bench, a tribal mask with labyrinthine carvings stares at the whirring transformer like an accomplice. <words>79</words>
It belonged to the historian who paid me in whispers and left through a rain that made the alley breathe. <words>99</words>
I pursue what I cannot forgive by gleaning secrets from half-truth historians, scavenging the glow between their omissions and pride. <words>119</words>
He'd spoken of a threshold in the mask, a riddle of current and shadow, the door of release hidden in plain faces. <words>141</words>
That phrase troubled the old wound in my ribs, the one my blade gave a brother when the contract soured. <words>161</words>
I want to open a door to the unknown, not to escape justice, but to meet it without begging for a script. <words>183</words>
So I test neon's vowels, set the mask beside the bench light, and listen to how its carvings trap the hum. <words>204</words>
The labyrinth bends inward, spirals like the memory of a duel, and my breath becomes a metronome for careful courage. <words>224</words>
When I align the flicker from a broken S with the mask's left eye, a path sketches itself across the cedar. <words>245</words>
It points to the storage closet, where the floor is stained from decades of spilled flux and unasked questions. <words>264</words>
I carry the mask, blade, and tools, reservedly bold, as if the shelves themselves might leap down and challenge me. <words>284</words>
The closet's back panel lifts, revealing a filigree of wires soldered into a spiral, a luminous map of the labyrinth. <words>304</words>
I set the mask over the coil and tune the dimmer until neon breathes like the sea catching its first conscience. <words>325</words>
The carvings redden, then cool to a patient blue, and a seam in the wall unthreads itself like silk. <words>344</words>
Through it comes the scent of rain and rust and wild roses, a corridor built of mercies I never asked for. <words>365</words>
I think of my brother's breathing, rough like a file, and of the historians who laughed while arranging their beautiful lies. <words>386</words>
I walk in, not to be forgiven, but to place my blade on the floor and close the door of release behind me. <words>409</words></story>
