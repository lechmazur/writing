<story>The hush that follows the final siren grips the vanishing point gallery like an exhausted lung holding its breath around me, the city's overworked detective. <words>25</words>
I am confidently unsure, which is to say I trust my doubt more than anyone else's certainty. <words>42</words>
The floor recedes to a vanishing line where frames once hung, and memory pours down the corridor like mercury with opinions. <words>63</words>
A single playing card lies face up in the center, the queen of spades smirking as if she did the lighting. <words>84</words>
Evidence that performs stand up comedy, my favorite miracle, and I am the heckler they keep on salary. <words>102</words>
I rummage through my pockets for gloves, find none, and handle the card with the care I reserve for vices and church doors. <words>125</words>
The backs of my eyes spark via the fleeting images in a half-damaged kaleidoscope, the kind that remembers when you do not. <words>147</words>
Memories hit like unmuffled footsteps, not clues but collisions, and each impact rearranges me into a person I almost recognize. <words>167</words>
I came here to outdance a looming inevitability, the one that says the past is a ventriloquist and I am only the dummy. <words>190</words>
The gallery's owner is gone, the alarms spent their voices, and the final siren left an aftertaste of tin and promise. <words>211</words>
In the hush, the queen tells jokes about power, and I laugh in molten sarcasm because mirth weighs less than guilt. <words>232</words>
I tilt the card to the light, and the kaleidoscope in my head fractures another scene: the owner, a child, trading prizes for applause. <words>256</words>
He grew up selling vanishing points, framing the world so it always fled from his debts, and tonight the world finally refused to run. <words>280</words>
The card is not a clue but a confession; the queen has his cheekbones, the smirk his sales pitch, the suit his creditors. <words>303</words>
I am confidently unsure enough to trust the joke, so I pocket her and follow the corridor to the place where the frames stop. <words>327</words>
There, the wallpaper opens into a storage throat, and I rummage again, this time through shadows that smell like varnish and promises. <words>349</words>
The kaleidoscope twitches, showing a flicker of the owner slipping a safe behind a false canvas while sirens stretched their last syllable into silence. <words>373</words>
I find the seam, pry it open, and inside is not money but photographs of customers, each smiling at the exact moment they were leaving themselves. <words>399</words>
Impact hums in my ribs, a chorus of exits that never finish, and I understand why he chose a queen who survives every decapitation. <words>423</words>
He wanted immortality by fragmentation, a life seen in shards so no single mirror could accuse him, and he almost managed it. <words>445</words>
I call it in during the hush that follows the final siren, and my report dances like a tired ballerina trying to outpace fate. <words>469</words>
Confidently unsure, I leave the gallery with the single playing card warm in my pocket, and the inevitability behind me learns a few new steps. <words>494</words>
