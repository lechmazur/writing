I came to the ice cavern because endings deserve the courtesy of a beginning. <words>14</words>
Call me a doomsday prepper, though my optimism keeps packing extra dawns beside the rations. <words>29</words>
In this blue cathedral of breath and drip, I wear a quantum entanglement watch band for faith. <words>46</words>
Its twin circles an ankle in another world, tugging when possibilities shiver. <words>58</words>
My preparations are politely chaotic, labeled with apologies and stacked like tidy avalanches along the wall. <words>74</words>
I have come to chart the colors of the unforeseen, tinctures the future leaks when it thinks no one looks. <words>94</words>
At the hush as a candle's flame is pinched, the cavern answers, a sigh made visible. <words>110</words>
I notify no gods, only the ice, that I will listen by analyzing the subtext of lullabies. <words>127</words>
I hum the ones my mother remembered but never sang, lullabies about doors that learned remorse. <words>143</words>
Between the rests, meanings bloom like frost ferns, self-similar and aching, a grammar of fractal sorrow. <words>159</words>
They tell me I do not have to outlast the world to create a new reality, only outlisten it. <words>178</words>
So I count drips as syllables, tally cracks as commas, and translate hush into maps. <words>193</words>
The watch band warms whenever a verse aligns with its twin's temperature, a handshake across unshared snow. <words>210</words>
I picture the other wearer falling, rising, pausing, a rhythm I can answer by shifting our seconds. <words>227</words>
Each tug lets me rearrange the shelves, advance a seedling, reroute a melt, prepare hope with tweezers. <words>244</words>
This is optimism as discipline, devotion measured in breaths you would loan to strangers after the sirens. <words>261</words>
Yet the cavern keeps returning me to colors no kit could bottle: bruise-violet, thaw-gold, apology-blue. <words>276</words>
They appear when I close my eyes at the pinch of the flame, and they stain the dark kindly. <words>295</words>
I ask the lullabies about exits, but they answer with cradles, and my cautious charts become cribs. <words>312</words>
Polite chaos suits a nursery, I suppose, where the future learns to fall without breaking the glass. <words>329</words>
But I am older than sleep, and my task is to escort a world to its better mirror. <words>347</words>
Notify, I whisper to the watch, when the other pulse steadies, and I will open the ice like a book. <words>367</words>
It tightens with agreement, and the lullabies lower their lanterns to inspect the threshold I have traced. <words>384</words>
At the hush again, the flame imagined between us vanishes, and time folds like a foil blanket. <words>401</words>
Through the fold walks the other me, politely chaotic as weather, carrying an ankle bright with our band. <words>419</words>
We compare colors of the unforeseen and find they match like grieving twins who have chosen laughter. <words>436</words>
Together we press our wrists to the ice and sing, translating sorrow into doorways no map forbids. <words>453</words>
When the cavern answers with a corridor, we enter, leaving behind the candle, the pinch, and the old sky. <words>472</words>
Reality follows, repacked, lighter, a child that has learned to carry its own winter. <words>486</words>
