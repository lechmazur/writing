<story>The floating library on a zeppelin drifted between channels, humming like a careful hive above cloud canyons. <words>17</words>
I was its renegade matchmaker, pairing readers with books the way storms choose rivers. <words>31</words>
My trade wore sharp gentleness, a blade wrapped in velvet, because desire needed both edges to be guided. <words>49</words>
Lovers found each other under gaslight globes as I shelved their untold stories into future shelves. <words>65</words>
But the zeppelin lately whispered a different hunger, the hush that follows a name almost remembered. <words>81</words>
Its antennae caught voices from the star lanes, thin as frost and braided with static riddles. <words>97</words>
They asked me to decipher an interstellar secret, a match waiting not between hearts, but truths. <words>113</words>
The first clue arrived as a colorless plastic button, innocuous, round, and hollow as a paused breath. <words>130</words>
It came sewn to a coat returned without its reader, a coat I had introduced to an atlas. <words>148</words>
I felt a tug, complicatedly simple, like a knot that yields when you look without blinking. <words>164</words>
I pried the button open and found a thread of microfilm, a translucent street where letters strolled. <words>181</words>
To read it, the pages had to flutter with the ripple of a flag in the wind. <words>198</words>
I set the library vents to a sailor's sigh, and the microfilm shivered into legible currents. <words>214</words>
The script lamented in equations, listing pairs that failed to meet, frequencies missing their intended counterparts. <words>230</words>
It was a registry of unmet signals, a ledger of broadcasts lost between channels where meaning thins. <words>247</words>
The coat's reader had hunted this ledger and vanished, perhaps matched to silence by my careless hands. <words>264</words>
Guilt rose, sharp and gentle, a twin tide that scoured me while stroking what remained of nerve. <words>281</words>
I vowed to make the right match: not lover to lover, but signal to waiting meaning. <words>297</words>
Night turned the windows into polished ink, and the zeppelin skimmed a corridor where constellations looped like stitches. <words>315</words>
I arranged the books into new aisles that spelled a question, their spines leaning like chorus singers. <words>332</words>
When the vents breathed, titles fluttered responses, and the antennae tuned to a weeping latitude beyond Mars. <words>349</words>
From there, a carrier wave arrived as a memory of rain, asking for its forgotten partner. <words>365</words>
I matched the wave to the ledger's last entry, the coat, the atlas, the unspoken itinerary. <words>381</words>
Across the library, a hidden hatch opened, and the button clicked like a lock letting go. <words>397</words>
The coat's reader stepped out between channels, eyes salt bright, carrying a notebook of repaired frequencies. <words>413</words>
They whispered that the secret was not a message but a practice, a way to listen. <words>429</words>
You match what aches to what answers, then you wait, complicatedly simple, until the wind finishes reading. <words>446</words>
I lament what I broke and mend what I can, apprentice to the secret I chased. <words>462</words>
Now I match frequencies and people with the same care, my hands teaching pages to ripple. <words>478</words>
Untold stories glide into hearing, and the zeppelin drifts onward, light yet laden, toward the next naming. <words>495</words></story>
