I keep the haunted amusement park prize booth open during slow afternoons, when gulls wheel over defunct rides like auditors. <words>20</words>
Amid bird watching, I measure the traffic of wings as if scoring a quiet symphony for a ruined fairground. <words>39</words>
I am a cynic cursed to speak only truth, which is inconvenient for sales but perfect for hauntings. <words>57</words>
People come for stuffed bears and leave with confessions, because the booth requests honesty as neatly as a ticket stub. <words>77</words>
I am politely vindictive, a varnish over splinters that never quite stop shining. <words>90</words>
Tonight a teacher arrives, mind stagnant as a drained moat, asking whether the grand prize is still a vintage pencil box. <words>111</words>
I show the box, mahogany scuffed soft, its compartments smelling of graphite, salt, and chalky carnival rain. <words>128</words>
On its underside the park stitched a tiny tapestry of fate, threadwork mapping rides to choices and choices to echoes. <words>148</words>
The tapestry is not prophetic, only editorial, trimming loose lies the way seabirds prune ragged feathers. <words>164</words>
The teacher wants certainty, not editing, and certainty is the slowest poison I have ever tasted. <words>180</words>
So I set the rules with the phases of the moon, prizes unfurling from crescent to gibbous to ruthless clarity. <words>200</words>
Each phase asks a truer statement, and each truth risks to petrify one prejudice into mineral immobility. <words>217</words>
He agrees because he believes he cannot change, which is why I must provoke evolution in a stagnant mind. <words>236</words>
Crescent rule, I say, name a bird you ignored as a child and why you looked away. <words>253</words>
He says, the starling, because it was common, and the lettered box clicks, sealing away his contempt for commonness. <words>272</words>
Quarter rule, I say, describe a student you misread, and he speaks a shy girl who answered only in drawings. <words>292</words>
The vintage pencil box opens a second compartment, pencils like thin bones, and the tapestry stitches a new shining path. <words>312</words>
Gibbous rule, I say, confess your use of certainty as armor, and he winces as the carousel lights blink awake. <words>332</words>
I watch a kestrel settle on the ring toss, amid bird watching still, and feel the park listening through feathered patience. <words>353</words>
He tells the truth, and I watch the habit of cruelty petrify, flaking like salt from an old pier. <words>372</words>
Full rule, I say, give away the prize if you win it, and he hesitates, then nods as the moon completes. <words>393</words>
The box hums, and the tapestry of fate loosens from its nails, draping his shoulders with a map of breathing futures. <words>414</words>
He tries to hand the prize back to me, but I tell him it belongs to the first person he misread. <words>435</words>
He leaves in layered tranquility, moving like fog that knows the coastline by heart. <words>449</words>
The booth returns to quiet, yet I feel newly cruel and newly kind, a politely vindictive lighthouse. <words>466</words>
Over weeks, with the phases of the moon, he returns gifts to students, chalk to servers, apology to his own father. <words>487</words>
The gulls approve, or so their patient spirals seem to say. <words>498</words>
