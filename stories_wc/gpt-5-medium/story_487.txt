They called me a docile bruiser, and I wore the name like a garden glove fitted over a scarred piano hand. <words>21</words>
I arrived at the greenhouse labyrinth stocked with man-eating plants, searching for a conductor's baton rumored to raise the dead. <words>41</words>
I came to mold a myth from the mud of reality, and no rumor flourishes better than one planted in damp glass light. <words>64</words>
A carnival band rehearsed nearby, and the floor trembled amid drum solos that shook pollen like slow glitter. <words>82</words>
With every roll, I felt the plants lean, listening, their mouths closing and opening as if rehearsing language. <words>100</words>
Language barriers had kept the baton hidden longer than brambles, because menace speaks in rustles I had learned to translate. <words>120</words>
I found my first clue by piecing together a shredded treasure map found under floorboards, each scrap taped to my forearm like ivy. <words>143</words>
The path wound in a twist that only violence or patience could unknot, and patience had always been my heaviest muscle. <words>164</words>
I was disturbingly calm as sawtooth orchids hissed around my knees, their tongues lapping the sweat from my shins with devotional hunger. <words>186</words>
I spoke to them in drum accents, knuckling metal pots like toms, letting rhythm carry the terms that words could not. <words>207</words>
The map drew me to a chamber where vines drooped like curtains over a dais, and on it rested a velvet case. <words>229</words>
Inside lay the baton, black as seed, its tip burnished by fingerprints that must have belonged to someone already a legend. <words>250</words>
I lifted it, expecting trumpets; instead, a hush like wet soil pressed into my ears and the band outside missed a beat. <words>272</words>
The plants bowed, or threatened to, and I realized the rumor had likely survived because nobody could tell command from comfort here. <words>294</words>
I remembered my mother, a conductor of traffic and tempers, who taught me brash tenderness, the art of moving crowds without bruising. <words>316</words>
So I tapped the case like a snare, then the floor, then my chest, setting a patient cadence that said follow and forgive. <words>339</words>
The carnivorous leaves opened like green mouths learning consonants, and together we moved through the maze, baton held low like a candle. <words>361</words>
I whispered that I would not raise the dead, only stories, because the living needed a myth more than a haunting. <words>382</words>
The baton warmed, and somewhere in the band a drummer found me, echoing my pulse, translating promise into backbeat across the glass maze. <words>405</words>
When I emerged, I was the docile bruiser who spoke plant and rhythm, and the crowd saw how myths grow from gentle power. <words>428</words>
