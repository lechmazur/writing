At the floating marketplace tethered to hot air balloons, I waited at the hush before the judge reads the verdict, heart clinking like loose vials. <words>25</words>
I am an uncertain alchemist, licensed only by rumor, my hands smelling of copper and sap, my pockets holding promises and errors in equal measure. <words>50</words>
Before my stool trembles with the wind, a broker slides me a parcel: a cracked scale from a mythical beast, bubbled with old lightning. <words>74</words>
He whispers that the scale is legally questionable, technically wild, and so am I, which is why he trusts me to keep it quiet. <words>98</words>
I did not come to bargain for relics; I came to map forest trails no one remembers, because maps are the only prayers I believe in. <words>124</words>
The forests move by night like sleepy animals, and only the oldest marble floor in the tribunal pavilion remembers where the paths once began. <words>148</words>
I have been studying its surface for months, learning to read direction through the coded scuffs on a centuries-old marble floor, where jurors once dragged their chairs. <words>175</words>
Each crescent of abrasion points to a bend, each fan of scratches to a fork, each darkened divot to a spring that still tastes of fennel and iron. <words>203</words>
If I can safeguard the scale and decode the floor, I will carry a map home to my sister, whose fever keeps her hovering just outside the world. <words>231</words>
The broker names his price: a tincture that halts rot, slows time, preserves fruit, flesh, and rumor, the everyday immortality merchants need to keep their stalls alive. <words>258</words>
He calls it practical, I hear it as the price of immortality, and my spine goes cold because prices stick like burrs. <words>280</words>
I can make it, of course, by dissolving the cracked scale with vinegar and star bluestem, then whispering a chant that tastes like rain on brass. <words>306</words>
But the beast who shed this scale will wake thinner for my success, and the trails will stray farther, as if embarrassed to be seen resisting time. <words>333</words>
The judge clears her throat; the entire market hushes as though the balloons themselves are holding breath, and my decision cannot float any longer. <words>357</words>
I set my mug on the floor, aligning its chipped rim with a constellation of scuffs that tell me to turn toward the eastern groves and away from sale. <words>386</words>
I tell the broker I will brew a weaker draught that preserves only bread and apples, mundane miracles, and that the scale must go back into the wind. <words>414</words>
He snarls about contracts, but I show him the map forming in chalk dust at my feet, a patient river of signs the marble releases when honored. <words>441</words>
When the verdict rings out, guilty of hoarding time, the crowd sighs, the balloons tilt, and I slip into the aisle the floor describes, carrying the scale toward the forest that still remembers us. <words>475</words>
