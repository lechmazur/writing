<story>During the hush after a child's last bedtime story, I climb the yggdrasil-like tree until clouds scuff my knuckles.<words>19</words>
I am a high-altitude con artist, but tonight my grift is gentler: to compose a cosmic lullaby sturdy enough for space.<words>40</words>
The branches hum with pristine chaos, their sap tick-tocking like metronomes that grew bored and learned how to dream.<words>59</words>
Nightmares collide in the canopies, not with thunder, but with the mundanely terrifying persistence of bills, dishes, alarms, and unread messages.<words>80</words>
My job, formerly to hustle oxygen-starved sherpas, is now to fraud the dark itself into believing it has been tucked in.<words>101</words>
I further this aspiration by unscrambling a set of sticky notes rearranged daily, letters clinging like rain to my chilled fingertips.<words>122</words>
Each square holds a borrowed syllable from someone else's nightmare, traded for a favor, a secret, a debt that can hum in key.<words>145</words>
I anchor them with a piece of fabric scrap torn from the blanket my mother once shook like a bell over my crib.<words>168</words>
The scrap steadies me against the wind that prowls these altitudes, the dishonest wind that promises rescue and always delivers salesmanship.<words>189</words>
I learned long ago that to sell a miracle you must first inventory its silences, so I count breaths between stars and leaves.<words>212</words>
Below, the sleeping neighborhoods glow like pocket universes, and I can hear the thermostat click, the refrigerator cough, the lock sigh shut.<words>234</words>
It is all so ordinary, and therefore lethal to wonder, unless a song intervenes at the seam where nightmares collide and thresholds blur.<words>257</words>
I arrange the notes into constellations that spell do not be afraid, but the field resists, insisting on be honest about fear first.<words>280</words>
Fine, I concede, and my con becomes confession: I have hawked altitudes to the desperate, sold views as cures, miscounted grace as change.<words>303</words>
The tree absorbs this truth, barters a lower breeze, and lets me hear how spiders pluck the web to warn the moon of traffic.<words>327</words>
With that tempo, I unscramble further, not for profit now but for proportion, letting each sticky note settle where gravity wants its rhyme.<words>350</words>
Words fold into a cradle, and the melody bends around the mundane, naming faucets, shoelaces, bus schedules, his backpack, her dinosaur, your patience.<words>373</words>
I stitch the cosmic lullaby through the fabric scrap, a talisman that knows both starlight and drool, and the world-tree hushes accordingly.<words>395</words>
Down below, the child's breath evens, the thermostat relents, and nightmares, finding no purchase, collide gently and tumble into compost for dreams.<words>417</words>
I stay a moment longer with my crooked trade, listening as pristine chaos becomes quiet order, and the con becomes a promise kept.<words>440</words></story>
