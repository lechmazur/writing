<story>
I stand barefoot in the dandelion field, a feral ranger listening for the world's next instruction. <words>16</words>
It is in the short pause following a newborn's first cry that the air turns tender and exact. <words>34</words>
Unfiltered perception floods me, each seedhead a compass, each bee a sentinel, each shadow a door left ajar. <words>52</words>
At my belt hangs a brass balance scale, its pans cupping pollen and memory like bright, trembling coins. <words>70</words>
My hands quiver as I weigh the hush against the distant drum of lives beginning elsewhere. <words>86</words>
The wind is precisely random, arranging dandelion clocks into sentences only I dare to read aloud. <words>102</words>
I learned the language through code words in receipts, crumpled slips traded at markets where names are optional. <words>120</words>
Midwives hid maps between totals, asterisks marking clearings, while elders tallied distances with jokes and missing commas. <words>137</words>
Their sums led me here, to embrace the unknown with open arms and grazing scars. <words>152</words>
In the village yurt beyond the hill, my sister labors, and the first cry has already stitched the horizon. <words>171</words>
Now comes the short pause, a thimble of time where the world decides whether to hush or sing again. <words>190</words>
I set a dandelion crown on the scale's left pan and a folded receipt on the right, asking for counsel. <words>210</words>
The needle steadies between them, then tilts toward breath, as if pollen carries the weight of futures. <words>227</words>
I was raised by border paths and nettles, a feral ranger married to weather, reading hoofprints like scripture. <words>245</words>
Unfiltered perception is not a gift but a chore, scrubbing lies from surfaces until every grain reflects. <words>262</words>
Still, hope keeps house beside the ache, washing the cups and leaving the window unlatched for whatever might arrive. <words>281</words>
My quiver of arrows lies untouched in the grass; today I aim only at the open space between heartbeats. <words>300</words>
A stray receipt in my pocket whispers totals that, when reversed, spell Stay, and the field seems to nod. <words>319</words>
Some seeds catch in my hair, quiver, and lift, counting seconds for me in bright, drifting arithmetic. <words>336</words>
When the pause breaks and the next cry pours out like sunlight, I gather the scale, the receipts, and walk smiling. <words>357</words>
I do not know the child's path, only that mine is to meet it and to embrace the unknown with open arms. <words>379</words>
The precisely random wind rings the field like a bell, and every stem answers Yes in its quiet accent. <words>398</words>
Later, I will send thanks through code words in receipts, subtle as petals pressed between totals. <words>414</words>
For now, the dandelions hold the balance, the world leans toward breath, and I step into the tender exactness. <words>433</words>
