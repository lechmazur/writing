<story>Between acts, I stand behind my portable forge in the cyberpunk city arcade, listening to neon hum like bees.<words>19</words>
I am a wistful blacksmith, hammering alloys and lullabies, trading sparks for stories with passersby disguised as players.<words>37</words>
Their tickets flicker on retinal panes, and each flicker is a small request to mend a blade, a bike rib, a broken narrative.<words>60</words>
I answer with drifting arrogance, the swagger that comes from making heat behave while the city refuses to.<words>78</words>
In my satchel lie botanical drawings, vellum leaves sketched from extinct parks, veins annotated with impossible patience.<words>95</words>
I study them between customers, letting their shapes overlay the circuit graffiti like a ghostly trellis.<words>111</words>
Everyone thinks I only fix hardware, but I kindle older fires, the kind that remember unpaved rain.<words>128</words>
My motive, honed on midnight anvil songs, is to weave fantasy into reality's cracks.<words>142</words>
I learned the grammar of wind by mapping the swirl of dust motes under a single skylight back when the arcade was a winter garden.<words>167</words>
Those motes drew constellations of movement, diagrams obviously subtle, and I copied them into the folds of the blueprints I now sell as repairs.<words>191</words>
When the performers pause, the crowd thins into a tidal hush, and I bring the hammer down as though striking a door in the air.<words>216</words>
Sparks climb, insects of light, and the drawings slip under my fingers, translating heat into leaf logic.<words>233</words>
I forge stealth seeds, titanium shells filled with sleeping lichens and code, each etched with a path of roots only the city can read.<words>257</words>
They look like trinkets for joystick charms, but they are the instruments of reclaiming the wild, keyed to vents, drains, billboard seams.<words>279</words>
When a buyer asks for a sharpened sprocket, I sell it, and with a nod that feels like prophecy, I tuck a seed into the foam.<words>305</words>
I am arrogant enough to think the city will listen, wistful enough to hear it murmur back.<words>322</words>
Security drones drift past like indifferent moons, their lenses tasting copper, but my smile is a visor, my intent wrapped in workshop routine.<words>345</words>
The performers return and the game cabinets roar, yet the hush I kindled stays inside those who watched the sparks, an ember of elsewhere.<words>369</words>
Later, as night glitches and the arcade's ceiling fogs, the seeds awaken to tiny maps traced on vents, following dust-star algebra.<words>390</words>
They root where the neon spills, drink condensate, and exhale geographies that fit the city like remembered armor.<words>408</words>
The botanical drawings were not memories but instructions, and my hammer was never only a tool, it was a translator between seasons.<words>430</words>
Between acts again, I wipe the anvil, smile my obviously subtle smile, and feel the arcade make room for roots beneath its games.<words>453</words>
Fantasy holds, the cracks widen, and reality, properly smithed, tries on a feral future and finds it fits.<words>471</words></story>
