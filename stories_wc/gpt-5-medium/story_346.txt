<story>Amid balloon pops, the boastful warrior entered the giant wasp's nest interior with a grin sharpened like a ceremonial blade. <words>20</words>
He bragged to the vibrating walls that destiny loved him more than honey loves ruin. <words>35</words>
But the combs hummed with an intimately impersonal rhythm, stinging every boast into syllables of arithmetic. <words>51</words>
He palmed his lint-filled pocket, expecting a charm, and pulled instead a knot of gray static. <words>67</words>
The static spoke by overhearing unguarded soliloquies that leaked from the tunnels like secret weather. <words>82</words>
Workers muttered of paper skies, queens rehearsed emphatic lies, drones hummed apologies to mirrors. <words>96</words>
Every confession stitched the air, and the undercurrent of clarity tugged his ribs like an undertow. <words>112</words>
He had come to escape a fabricated reality, yet discovered the fabricators sang without knowing. <words>127</words>
Precise madness requires a metronome, so he matched his breath to the nest's clipped thrum. <words>142</words>
Then he vowed, less loudly, to rewire the boast that had caged him. <words>155</words>
He listened to the unguarded soliloquies until their phrases aligned like comb teeth, mapping a possible exit. <words>172</words>
He traced a corridor where drones secretly wished for storms, a shaft where the queen feared mirrors. <words>189</words>
Every step he swore was legend, but his feet kept the count, intimate with dust, impersonal toward glory. <words>207</words>
When balloons popped somewhere beyond the paper sky, the nest paused, listening to its own arithmetic. <words>223</words>
He seized the pause and threaded the static into a cord that pulled at the walls' careful lies. <words>241</words>
Panels lifted like eyelids, revealing a funnel of daylight shaped like a blade he could finally sheath. <words>258</words>
Before stepping through, he emptied the lint-filled pocket and saw how the gray had recorded him. <words>274</words>
Every brag, every sneer, every private myth was rubbed into the lint like fingerprints on weather. <words>290</words>
He understood that the nest had not trapped him; his rehearsed legend had, a script learned from echoes. <words>308</words>
So he rewired the legend by removing its audience, choosing to speak only to the undercurrent of clarity. <words>326</words>
In that intimacy without face, the static whispered routes while he counted mismatched heartbeats like stepping stones. <words>343</words>
He stepped into daylight as balloons kept popping, each report a tidy erasure of a former boast. <words>360</words>
Outside, the world bent like wet cane, but did not break, and he finally believed it might be real. <words>379</words>
He refused to narrate, letting silence do the boasting, which proved sharper than any blade he had named. <words>397</words>
Behind him, the nest resumed its arithmetic, but its sums no longer included his shadow. <words>412</words>
He walked on, a boastful warrior unboasted, guided by a clarity that sounded like wings at rest. <words>429</words></story>
