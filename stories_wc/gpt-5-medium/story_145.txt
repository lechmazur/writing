At dusk I entered the forgotten castle ruin library, chasing a rumor that felt uncertainly certain in my gut. <words>19</words>
I was a secret society dropout, branded by oaths I refused, still practicing fantasy practicality as if it were honest carpentry. <words>40</words>
It was during the hush of colliding destinies, or so the archives whispered, that the task finally found me. <words>59</words>
I had come to kindle empathy where none remains, to reconquer a hall of voiceless minds fossilized behind soot and vellum. <words>80</words>
Every codex here hinted at hidden worlds below the flagstones, reachable only by listening rather than reading. <words>97</words>
I carried a dried rosebud wrapped in thread, a keepsake from the only friend who believed my exile could still be service. <words>119</words>
She taught me to ask buildings questions via the echo test on water pipes in an abandoned mansion where we once hid. <words>141</words>
So I pressed an iron stanchion, found a cold pipe, and tapped out a greeting, counting notes until a patient rhythm replied. <words>163</words>
The old library hummed like a throat cleared of dust, and I answered with names, starting with hers. <words>181</words>
I had betrayed a seal to save her, and the society cast me out; now I begged the stones to forgive my efficient cowardice. <words>205</words>
The pipes answered with a change of temperature, like a shiver, and a panel behind a rotted atlas swung inward. <words>225</words>
I entered a stairwell spiraling into wet dark, each step announcing cautious intent, uncertainly certain that my purpose outweighed my fear. <words>246</words>
Below lay reading rooms for the drowned and the forgotten, a city of shelves where water mapped secret inks into tidal constellations. <words>268</words>
I pinned the dried rosebud to my collar and spoke as she had instructed, asking the flood to remember the kindness of bodies it once held. <words>294</words>
I did not come to conquer but to reconquer what sorrow had taken from language, the shy bridge between strangers. <words>314</words>
I tapped again, slower, and the pipes passed the message through the library city, summoning listeners whose miseries rhymed with my own. <words>336</words>
Shadows gathered, not to haunt but to translate, and I read their grief aloud until the vaults breathed easier, as if remembering breath. <words>359</words>
Then her voice arrived through the metal like a kettle almost singing, telling me to share the blame before seeking absolution. <words>380</words>
I confessed my pride, how the society taught manipulation without mercy, how I had mistaken cleverness for care where none remains. <words>401</words>
Water welled from hidden valves and rinsed the margins, not erasing but softening, and the ink let tiny silhouettes clasp hands. <words>422</words>
With fantasy practicality I patched leaks with linen and wax, humming the rhythm of the echo test to keep the pipes steady. <words>444</words>
When I finally climbed back into the ruined stacks, the hush had become a promise, and I was an uncertainly certain dropout no more. <words>468</words>
