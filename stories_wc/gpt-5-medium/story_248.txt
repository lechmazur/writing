In the abandoned space freighter docking bay, I served as an unsteady sentinel waiting for instructions from a silence that knew me better than command ever did. <words>27</words>
Time purred between worlds colliding, as if the hull were a throat and the void a tongue pronouncing our unfinished names. <words>48</words>
A strange automaton bird perched on a ruptured conduit, its brass feathers ticking like grief, its glass eyes reflecting me in disassembled shards. <words>71</words>
It had flown through the ship's ribs to deliver a pouch of shredded letters, bits of prophecy chewed by vacuum and rumor. <words>93</words>
I needed to clear the fog of a misguided prophecy by reassembling shredded letters, because command's algorithms had called me a glitch and left us to drift. <words>120</words>
In cheerless ecstasy, my fingers sorted the fragments across a deck patterned with rust constellations and old burn marks. <words>139</words>
The sentences rebuilt themselves slowly, arranging into the ambush of fate, where each clause stepped out from shadow and took positions around my memory. <words>163</words>
The bird watched, coyly furious, scolding me with tiny clicks whenever I mistook an accent or misread a burn as punctuation. <words>184</words>
The prophecy, once mended, recommended I stand down and let the docking bay seal, yet every verb came with a bruised echo that recommended defiance instead. <words>210</words>
I was an unsteady sentinel because steadiness is a lie taught to metal, and I had too much hurtful weather inside to keep still. <words>234</words>
From the far hatch, footsteps poised like tripwires, and I felt the ambush of fate tighten its patient knot around the bay's breath. <words>257</words>
The automaton bird opened its beak and projected a map of trajectories, recommending a narrow corridor through debris where two catastrophes might cancel each other if I moved now. <words>286</words>
I chose to trust the machine because it alone had flown the ribs of silence, and because my own nerves were orchestra wires tuned to a dangerous, necessary, key. <words>315</words>
I cycled the maglocks, angled the bay, and stepped into the corridor, between worlds colliding like cymbals behind my ribs while the freighter groaned toward a false conjunction. <words>343</words>
The footsteps resolved into salvors whose helmets mirrored their hunger, but the corridor inverted gravity on my quiet command, and their boots flowered into panic as they drifted into the sealing bulkhead. <words>375</words>
I returned to the bird and the letters, and I recommended to the future that it stop arriving all at once, that it learn to knock before it changes a heart. <words>406</words>
Cheerless ecstasy rinsed the fog from my visor, and through that clearing I saw that prophecy was merely the bruise left by a choice not yet made. <words>433</words>
I remained an unsteady sentinel, but steadiness is overrated when the ambush of fate can be delayed by care, by letters made whole, and by a bird teaching patience with relentless ticking. <words>465</words>
