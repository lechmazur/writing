<story>I met the deflated oracle at an abandoned carnival ring toss game, its prizes sagging like moons that had forgotten their tides. <words>22</words>
We were already within the realm of the subconscious, where rust sings and time breathes helium, rising funny and sad at once. <words>44</words>
The oracle held an empty perfume bottle up to the dim lights, as if memories might condense again and crown the glass with a fragrant halo. <words>70</words>
They introduced themself as an independently dependent witness to collapsed prophecies, a custodian who needed no master yet leaned on every whisper the world exhaled. <words>95</words>
From a stack of faded scorecards, they dealt me dreamlike invitations, each card inked with places I had never stood but somehow remembered leaving. <words>119</words>
Come, they said, if you want to rewrite history without waking it, and their mouth folded around the words like a shy, gleeful bruise. <words>143</words>
What we would enact, they promised, would be done by reconfiguring the braids of a centuries-old ceremonial rope between the posts where bottles once waited. <words>168</words>
It lay coiled behind the stall, tarred with prizes, caramel, and rain, a serpent that had choked cheers into silence and now kept the silence warm. <words>194</words>
I nodded, feeling melancholic glee swell like cotton candy in my throat, sweet and emptily towering, because I had ruined things by leaving too early once. <words>220</words>
The empty perfume bottle was my ticket, its absence of scent a receipt for a future, its glass a bell that would ring when absence became direction. <words>247</words>
The oracle draped the rope over the ring-toss pegs, humming a lullaby to entropy, and began to split and cross the braids in impossible arithmetic. <words>272</words>
With each refigured loop, a letter unfolded in the air, one of those dreamlike invitations now addressed to my yesterdays, inviting them to arrive late. <words>297</words>
We set rings spinning through the letters, and where metal kissed vowel, an hour slowed, where metal kissed consonant, a deed delayed until kindness could catch it. <words>324</words>
The deflated oracle puffed with effort, independently dependent in their labor, each breath theirs and also borrowed from the crowd that once cheered here, unseen yet present. <words>351</words>
As the rope clicked into a new braid, the stall lights trembled, and I felt my first goodbye hesitate, then rewrite itself into a pause long enough for forgiveness. <words>380</words>
Melancholic glee fizzed through the dust, a carnival prize that finally fit. <words>392</words>
Inside the empty perfume bottle, silence condensed to neroli and rain, naming the unnamed hours we had mended. <words>410</words>
We enacted no applause, only a soft release, and the oracle smiled with collapsing grandeur as the invitations curled to smoke, leaving the rope ready for tomorrow's ghosts. <words>438</words>
We parted within the realm of the subconscious, independently dependent still, and the ring toss stood straighter, as if history had finally learned how to miss and to stay. <words>467</words></story>
