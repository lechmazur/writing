<story>After the last riddle is whispered at the puzzle event, the crowd drifts down the dark hill, leaving me among columns older than my grandmother's sighs. <words>26</words>
I am a back-alley puppeteer, trained to hear truth in strings and timber, and I came here to uncover a hidden truth the riddles only circled. <words>52</words>
The temple breathes a hush that feels like alone intimacy, the kind my puppets imitate when their wooden hands almost touch. <words>73</words>
Beside me sits a vintage stamp album, its cracked leather the exact shade of olives left too long in sun. <words>93</words>
Each stamp bears a country my mother never admitted visiting, perforations pricking like notation for symphonies of truth only wind instruments could play. <words>116</words>
The puzzle host had been irritatingly perfect, rehearsed cheekbones and precise lanterns, but his final whisper pointed not to prizes, only to an altar shade. <words>141</words>
In that dim, I find the trunk the map suggested, a cedar chest scarred with burn marks like fingerprints turned to meteors. <words>163</words>
Inside waits a wedding gown, brittle with dust, hems torn by years and something that reads as tears, as though grief hemmed alongside lace. <words>187</words>
I thread my puppet needles through the folds, and, via tears in the folds of a wedding gown found in a trunk, a secret map raises like braille. <words>215</words>
Salt has stiffened certain pleats, outlining islands that match the stamps, and a route the album refuses to show unless the cloth sings. <words>238</words>
I hold the gown to the temple fire, and the smoke remodulates the air, a remodeling of memory that redraws the ruin into a theater of reconciliation. <words>265</words>
My strings are my antennae, and when I lift them the amphorae whisper names, including my mother's stage alias and the priest who married no one. <words>291</words>
Their voices pluck the stamps until the album opens to a final envelope tucked beneath the Grecian profile of Athena, addressed to the puppeteer in the alley. <words>318</words>
Inside, a photograph shows the irritatingly perfect host as a boy, holding the same gown before a half-built stage, a caption scrawled, We will remodel lies into music. <words>346</words>
The note is signed by my mother and a mason-priest, and suddenly the symphonies of truth I have chased for years resolve like dusk finally consenting to stars. <words>374</words>
They had built puzzle temples across ports, coding their affair into riddles and travel, promising to break silence only when a child learned to listen through cloth. <words>401</words>
Alone, I dress my marionette in the gown, aligning tears with cicatrice constellations on stone, and the figure trembles as if remembering vows. <words>424</words>
I perform for the empty naos, voice low, confessing her journey to myself, to the O of columns, to the wind that turns pages and strings. <words>450</words>
The puppet bows, and with that motion a hidden pocket opens in the album, releasing a ring that fits my thumb like a promise kept late. <words>476</words>
I kiss cold metal and vow to remodel my craft into testimony, to tour ports and temples, conducting our symphonies of truth aloud. <words>499</words>
