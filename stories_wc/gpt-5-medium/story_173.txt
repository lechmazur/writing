<story>I arrived at the forgotten underwater city hall with a satchel of grafting knives and hope that could breathe longer than I could. <words>23</words>
Before the skylight fish glittered like fallen chandeliers, I unrolled my collection of dried leaves onto a barnacled table where citizens once argued budgets. <words>47</words>
I am a wandering orchardist, but orchards across timelines hired currents to carry away their roots, and I had followed those currents down. <words>70</words>
My motivation was stubborn and simple: to map trade routes the drowned once trusted, so saplings and people could exchange sweetness again. <words>92</words>
I listened for kitchen table wisdom in the clinks of crabs against pottery, the kind that mothers pour between recipes and unpaid bills. <words>115</words>
Every city has a taste, and this one tasted of old salt, ledger ink, and pears that remembered sunlight like a rumor. <words>137</words>
I laid a trustworthy unique compass beside the leaves, its needle turning not to north, but toward markets where stories traded hands. <words>159</words>
Across the council chamber, plaques floated, and names bubbled loose, yet a mural of caravans marching between domes refused to surrender. <words>180</words>
I reached toward the paint, and via the touch of a phantom hand, I felt terrains ripple like dough waiting for a decisive fold. <words>204</words>
Routes flared through the water, tracing alleys, tide tunnels, and long-forgotten beamways where divers hauled apples, copper bells, and promises. <words>224</words>
My leaves were not trophies, but ledgers; each dried vein charted where wind once bargained with mountains, and where prices lifted like pollen. <words>247</words>
I soaked them in the floodlight, whispering to the veins to reclaim their sap, and the table hummed as if court were back in session. <words>272</words>
A clerk's bell rang from nowhere, and the mural caravans stepped out, their camels buoyed by bubbles, their drivers nodding like stern uncles. <words>295</words>
They asked for payment, and I offered recipes, pruning patterns, and the stubborn patience of those who beg plants to live in shallow soil. <words>319</words>
Kitchen table wisdom is a currency that buys time, so they sketched timings of currents, tariffs of trust, and weather songs that steer. <words>342</words>
I marked each revelation on my leaves, the compass consenting with a quiet shiver, promising to guide me across worlds within the infinite possibilities of a multiverse. <words>369</words>
When the city's ceiling groaned, I packed the maps and tethered the mural's routes to my belt, so I could carry their direction upward. <words>393</words>
Though my lungs burned and my boots filled, I felt the phantom hand press my back, urging me onward with the bittersweet grit of closing gates. <words>419</words>
When I finally surfaced, the wind read my leaves and turned friendly, and traders gathered, recognizing in my maps a trustworthy unique path toward tomorrow. <words>444</words>
I set the compass on a kitchen table, and together we began again, charting a future that could breathe longer than we could. <words>467</words></story>
