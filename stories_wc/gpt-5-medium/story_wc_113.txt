<story>I am the orchestra pit musician the flood forgot, shivering beside a cracked viola case. [15]
The stage above moans softly, boards swollen with black water and memory. [27]
The whole place is a flooded opera house lit by flickering lanterns hung like tired moons. [43]
I wait amid the hush of unstruck chords, not daring to breathe too loudly. [57]
I am lately inspired, but inspiration here is more a tide than a blaze. [71]
My hand cradles an antique opera program rescued from a drowned velvet seat. [84]
Water damage creating images stains its pages, blooms of ink that look like moth wings. [99]
In the right angle of lantern light, the wings become notes, feathers become rests, stafflines emerge. [115]
I think of in between spaces where music lives, tremulous as air above a bow. [130]
Sound resides there, between the wet timber and the memory of audiences whose shoes squeaked. [145]
And something else watches there, a patience pressed flat as water against glass. [158]
I came to unravel the code left by a ghost, and the room listens. [172]
Everyone said she drowned backstage when the siphons failed, mid-cadenza, mouth full of light. [186]
They said the conductor kept beating time, because silence asked for no permission. [199]
Now her program bleeds with shapes, and I sit knee-deep, cold nibbling my shins. [213]
I turn pages as if turning pond lilies, careful not to disrupt their mirrored grammar. [228]
Each blot ripples a bit when a lantern flickers, and the stave wavers into letters. [243]
Not alphabet letters, but the negative shapes between them, a language sculpted from silence. [257]
I hear her like a breath behind my ear, asking me to answer wordlessly. [271]
It is a wordless conversation conducted in drips, in glints, in pauses between creaks. [285]
The code says, begin where the water begins, trace the hem of the drowned curtain. [300]
I slosh to the pit rail and find the curtain fringe frozen in a ripple. [315]
Lantern light combs its beads, and beads throw constellations onto the warped ceiling. [328]
She is drawing maps with reflection, and the map favors the places between places. [342]
Between pit and stage, between seat and aisle, between face and mask, corridors thin as seams. [358]
I listen and follow, a metronome wound by fear and a pilgrim's curiosity. [371]
The program's wet margins keep inventing shapes, a dancer's arm, a drowned key, a compass rose. [387]
Water damage creating images becomes a lanternslide opera, and my eyes become the audience. [401]
The path steers me under the stage, past sandbags puffed like lungs, to a door that swells. [418]
I shoulder it until wood sighs and the room exhales the smell of old perfume. [433]
Lantern in my teeth, I enter a pocket no architect would claim, a tender seam. [448]
Here, the flood is patient, flat, a waiting glass where the ceiling paints itself twice. [463]
On the far wall hangs a portrait kissed by mildew, its varnish crazed into river deltas. [479]
She looks out from it without eyes, the soprano who swallowed a note larger than breath. [495]
The program tells me to lift the lantern and tilt it like a conductor's baton. [510]
When I do, light, water, and print align, projecting a score onto the swollen door. [525]
It is a score of rests, a choreography for silence, instructions to step on reflections only. [541]
Obedience means not disturbing sound, disobedience means drowning again, and I understand the bargain. [555]
I cross by placing my weight in the in between spaces, on glints not water, on breath not word. [574]
The floor accepts me like a stagehand, and the portrait's mouth unbuttons into a tiny door. [590]
Inside is a box of bone-white sticks, not bones, but batons, each chewed at the tip. [606]
One is carved with letters that are not letters, the negative script of her final aria. [622]
I take it and the water lifts, a slow standing applause, and the lanterns gutter. [637]
She asks for a conductor, so I raise the baton and keep time for silence. [652]
The house listens, the timbers lean in, and together we disrupt the loop of drowning. [667]
I beat rests until they turn to breaths, and the portrait softens, paint smoothing like skin. [683]
The box closes itself, relieved, and the program's stains rearrange into a coda shaped like dawn. [699]
The lanterns steady, brightening the in between spaces until they are less between, more bridge. [714]
I put the baton in my case, beside rosin and a mute, two tools for quiet. [730]
When I leave, the water settles as if a breath were finally released, and the house rests. [747]
Back in the pit, amid the hush of unstruck chords, I wait for the next conversation. [763]
It will not need words, only room for ghosts to breathe in the between. [777]</story>
