At the break of a brittle branch in a silent forest, the gentle conjurer felt the summons bloom like frost inside his palms. <words>23</words>
He followed the trembling echo underground, down stone windpipes that emptied into the underground city of the dwarves, where dawn was hammered from ore. <words>47</words>
Joyful terror pricked him, a brightness that warned and welcomed, for he had come to seek justice and to rebuild a forgotten garden. <words>70</words>
The dwarves had paved over the memory of it with anvils, markets, and dependable lamplight, yet their children dreamed nightly of petals made of bells. <words>95</words>
In the council hall, a stained glass butterfly hung shattered on black threads, as if flight itself had been torn and cataloged. <words>117</words>
They said the butterfly once mapped the rivers of mercy beneath the city, but in the last war every pane had been judged guilty by silence. <words>143</words>
The conjurer listened to the dwarf elders speak in careful riddles whose meanings were, with dwarven irony, inscrutably obvious. <words>162</words>
They wanted justice that could be mined, weighed, purchased, but justice had to be grown, and that was why they had unconsciously called him. <words>186</words>
He said he would reassemble the butterfly only if they agreed to read all messages backward for a moon, and they laughed until they considered it. <words>212</words>
For truth would travel through reversed messages, their quarrels unbraiding into confessions, their ledgers unmasking debts owed to roots, waters, widows, and wind. <words>235</words>
The moon, being a brass plate in this subterranean quarter, was turned nightly by apprentices, and so the experiment could begin at once. <words>258</words>
Letters walked backward across notice boards, gossip gulped itself and returned as apology, and court verdicts unraveled until clean thread lay between judge and prisoner. <words>283</words>
All the while, the conjurer coaxed fragments of the butterfly from vaults, gutters, helmets, and a child's pocket, singing the garden's lost rain-syllables. <words>306</words>
With every shard fitted to its neighbor, the council's secrets grew fragrant, and fear learned a tune so bright it danced like a forge-fire. <words>330</words>
That was the joyful terror, a trembling that did not flee, because here at last was the search for justice finding somewhere to root. <words>354</words>
When the final pane clicked into wing, the butterfly shivered and cast maps upon the arches, each river braided with patient vines and absent names. <words>379</words>
The names wrote themselves backward first, then forward, and the dwarves, eyes wet with coal shine, read aloud their debts to the garden they lost. <words>404</words>
They brought soil from tunnel margins and light from furnace mouths, and under the butterfly's stained radiance, terraces rose like waking steps. <words>426</words>
The conjurer planted seeds carried from that silent forest where the brittle branch had broken, and roots remembered the corridor back down into bloom. <words>450</words>
When dawn rose again, it was not hammered but cultivated, and the dwarves swore, in forward speech, to guard mercy like the metal of life. <words>475</words>
