<story>After the tower falls, the sky becomes a carefully held breath. [11]
Within the glass-domed enclosure, I keep a desert rose farm alive. [22]
Dust scrawls outside, but the dome holds an engraved quiet that steadies me. [35]
I am a bounty hunter's pacifist daughter, and my hands remember restraint. [47]
My father taught me how to track, so I learned to pause instead. [60]
Now, after the collapse, people come with knives and names, seeking straight lines. [73]
They leave footprints in the vestibule sand, then stall at the thresholds of roses. [87]
I ask them to sheathe whatever bites, including words honed by panic. [99]
They obey, because the heat has already scorched their edges smooth. [110]
The roses are sand-born, thick with spines like tiny sundials set to mercy. [123]
I have been inculcating plants with values since I learned to listen. [135]
I thread stories through irrigation tubes, whispering patience into the mineral taste. [147]
I lay maps under their roots, so they inherit reverent directions. [158]
The blooms swing to face the unbroken, and slowly, people mirror them. [170]
You are senselessly perceptive, my father said, when he still believed in edges. [183]
He meant I felt more than I could prove, and less than I would strike. [198]
He has not returned since the tower fell, since rumors sharpened like thorns. [211]
Some say he cut a rope on an airship to save strangers drifting. [224]
Others say he severed the city's spine and walked away unscarred. [235]
In the workroom, I keep an airship ballast sandbag scrap beside the watering can. [249]
It is rough as a prayer stone, frayed with the same exhausted hope. [262]
When visitors arrive, I ask them to hold it and count their breaths. [275]
Their hands slow, and the engraved quiet hums back through their wrists. [287]
Today a trio approaches, carrying heat like lanterns cupped against wind. [298]
They name the tower, the dead, and the debts, each syllable dry. [310]
They ask for my father, and for blame, and for the map to grief. [324]
I tell them they can plant their questions, and the roots will answer. [337]
They scoff, but sit, because the dome makes derision sound like thirst. [349]
I string the scrap to a young rose, let it tug the stem toward memory. [364]
Around it, I slip the irrigation line and pour diluted honeyed tea. [376]
My voice carries the story I never heard but feel through fissures. [388]
An airship drifted low as the tower wavered, shadow smearing the noon. [400]
A rope jammed, a ballast bag refused release, and weight skewed cruelly. [412]
My father could either cut or watch the gondola shear into houses. [424]
He cut, and the airship listed free, and the tower, already cracked, buckled. [437]
He tried to shoulder blame like a saddle, then vanished into mirage. [449]
The trio watches the rose, which leans, thorn by thorn, toward the scrap. [462]
It is not magic, only habit; I have been teaching them gratitude. [474]
When debt and mercy are paired, the roses cast more shade than fire. [487]
The visitors breathe, and the dome fills with a tranquil blaze of calm. [500]
One lays a knife on the table, and we all hear it soften. [513]
I sheathe the knife with cloth and soil, the simplest sheets we have. [526]
Another asks what they owe, and I point to the nursery beds. [538]
Plant names, I say, names you can carry without bleeding. [548]
We carve labels from broken slate, and the air cools with purpose. [560]
They choose to honor the lost with seedlings that will shade strangers. [572]
Each name is pressed beneath a clear stone, weight without wound. [583]
Outside, the dust sings its harsh litany against the curved glass. [594]
Inside, the roses drink, and the engraved quiet becomes a shared vow. [606]
Later, after they leave, I find a message pegged beneath the sluice. [618]
It is my father's looped script, tethered with a sliver of holster leather. [631]
He writes that he cannot come home until blame learns to breathe. [643]
He asks me to keep the farm open, to weave continuity through chaos. [656]
I press the letter to the sandbag scrap, and they seem kin. [668]
Both carried weight, both were cut to make the falling kinder. [679]
I tie them to a trellis where the oldest rose can read them. [692]
I tell the plant the values again: gentleness, steadiness, and honest heat. [704]
Night lowers its velvet bucket, and the dome gathers starlight like dew. [716]
Somewhere he walks, a shadow among shadows, not hunting, but guiding. [727]
He will return when the city learns how to hold its own blaze. [740]
Until then, I tend the roses, the visitors, and the breathing knives. [752]
The farm becomes a hinge soundless with use, turning ruin toward renewal. [764]
This is my work, and it is enough to keep the world threaded. [777]</story>
