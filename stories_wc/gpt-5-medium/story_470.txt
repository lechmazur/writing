The night the steampunk submarine library moored beneath Market Bridge, the city above burbled amid street fairs and fireworks. <words>19</words>
I am a practical bard, my songs tuned to gears and gaskets, not fickle applause. <words>34</words>
Tonight my peculiar talents hummed with breathless longing for a calling older than lantern brass. <words>49</words>
I had come to seek a path to become a guardian of ancient wisdom. <words>63</words>
The stacks slumbered like whale ribs, valves chuffing, catalog balloons bobbing below copper conduits. <words>77</words>
From above drifted hurdy gurdy reels and kettle steam, a counterpoint that made the pressure rise. <words>93</words>
A reading desk shuddered off tempo, and a stripped screw clattered from its brass joint to my boot. <words>111</words>
I picked it up, feeling its rueful thread, precisely imperfect as if inviting a kinder hand. <words>127</words>
A kinder hand, I had learned, sings before it tightens, so I breathed a truing note. <words>143</words>
The desk sighed, and a panel with etched portholes loosened along a seam I had not noticed. <words>160</words>
Behind it yawned a hidden compartment containing a secret diary bound in oilskin and salt. <words>175</words>
The first page smelled of the deep, and the script unfurled like currents arguing in the dark. <words>192</words>
Dear successor, it read, your worth is in what you accept and what you refuse to mechanize. <words>209</words>
My throat tightened as trumpets flared somewhere above, laughter filtering through bilge vents like quicksilver. <words>224</words>
Page by page, I learned the library sailed under carnivals to measure a city dreaming of discovery. <words>241</words>
Guardians listened to those dreams, then nudged them, precisely imperfect, so invention would not sink compassion. <words>257</words>
The diary instructed me to return the screw damaged, a reminder that mastery keeps a thread of mercy. <words>275</words>
I set the screw soft, humming the fault into harmony, and the brass filigree warmed like skin. <words>292</words>
A small lens ignited, projecting a tidal map of stories that wanted a keeper unafraid of human seams. <words>310</words>
Voices rose topside, vendors counting coins, children chasing confetti, and my pulse matched their bright disorder. <words>326</words>
To become a guardian of ancient wisdom, I would have to stay below when the world felt loudest. <words>344</words>
I would have to barter verses for valves, applause for quiet, and accept the peculiar talents I had buried. <words>363</words>
Breath quick, I closed the diary, returned it to its chamber, and followed the slow heartbeat of engines. <words>381</words>
The last instruction glimmered across the lens, asking for a song that taught forgetting without forsaking. <words>397</words>
So I sang of fairs and flags, of maps that blur at the edges so hearts can discover the middle. <words>417</words>
The hull answered, the shelves breathed, and somewhere above the reels corrected themselves to our truer tempo. <words>434</words>
When the map dimmed, the desk presented a badge of brass and paper, flimsy and eternal at once. <words>452</words>
I pinned it with the stripped screw, leaving the scar of its threads visible, and the library accepted me. <words>471</words>
Above, music scattered like gulls, below, the deep answered, and I descended to guard what still remembers us. <words>489</words>
