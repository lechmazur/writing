The arrogant swordsman stepped into the calligraphy master's courtyard, shoes dusty, chin lifted as if sky and ink owed him apology. <words>21</words>
I came to deliver a spark where all lights have gone out, he declared, voice honed like a whetted edge. <words>41</words>
The master studied him with harsh tenderness, as if evaluating a troublesome stroke that might yet redeem the scroll. <words>60</words>
You are doubtfully confident, he said, a flawed seal pressed too hard, and your potential is shackled by your own armor. <words>81</words>
From his sleeve the swordsman slid a faded tapestry fragment, edges furred, its woven cranes dimming like distant fires drowned by fog. <words>103</words>
This belonged to my grandmother, he said, the only inheritance surviving when raiders scattered our names like torn petitions. <words>122</words>
Give me your inkstone seal and authorize a duel, so I may relight what they smothered. <words>138</words>
The master did not move; cicadas spun their thin saws, and shadows from hanging scrolls barred the ground like prison grates. <words>159</words>
You mistake flame for light, he murmured, and your blade for breath. <words>171</words>
Then teach me to breathe, the swordsman said, though pride flickered at the edges of his mouth. <words>188</words>
With two fingers the master indicated a stone basin catching rain, where fallen blossoms drifted like small decrees rescinding themselves. <words>208</words>
Sing the traditional song sung at every family wedding, he commanded, and match your blade to the ripples. <words>226</words>
The swordsman blinked, remembering uncles slurring verses, cousins spilling tea, and his mother's hands stitching this very tapestry fragment. <words>245</words>
He began softly, doubt weaving through confidence, a tune about joining breath to breath until two lives learned one life. <words>265</words>
His voice dragged like a blade through wet reeds, but the basin answered, ripples ringing the petals into measured circles. <words>285</words>
The master lifted a brush, not quite writing, letting bristles suspend between strokes, a ceremony of waiting between breaths. <words>304</words>
In that pause, arrogance shed its lacquer; the swordsman felt the shackled potential within him strain like a tied hawk. <words>324</words>
He followed the song's circles, blade poised, wrist loosening, and cut the air only where the water spoke go. <words>343</words>
Petals parted but did not drown; the edge, newly humble, wrote a character of light across the courtyard's dim. <words>362</words>
Authorize yourself, the master said, and his voice cracked like old bamboo, yet held him upright as if by the shoulders. <words>383</words>
The swordsman lowered his blade, and the cranes on the fragment seemed to lift, their threads recalling vows of lanterns and patience. <words>405</words>
I will carry this song into nighted streets, he vowed, to deliver a spark where all lights have gone out. <words>425</words>
Not by fire alone, the master warned, but by a cut so careful it opens shutters without wounding the house. <words>445</words>
Between breaths they bowed, harsh tenderness braiding them, student and teacher authorized by water, ink, and a wedding song turned bladecraft. <words>466</words>
