During the final beep of a hospital monitor, the seasoned woodsman opened his eyes to a radio wave garden only he could see. <words>23</words>
Antennae sprouted like cattails, transmitting the breath of storms and the gossip of distant rails, all humming with despairing cheer. <words>43</words>
He had come here to map abandoned railways, the phantom veins of towns that had forgotten their own feet. <words>62</words>
His method was humble and exacting, by measuring the echo in an abandoned water tower and sketching lines from the delays. <words>83</words>
In his sack knocked a compass, a coil of wire, and an antique hairbrush for smoothing the map's artfully messy charcoal. <words>104</words>
The brush had belonged to Mara, who hated the forests but loved the way tracks pulled horizons taut. <words>122</words>
Her bed was three floors beneath the beeping, and he felt every pause as a frost on bark. <words>140</words>
The nurse had said the next alert would be the last, and still his boots found the tower. <words>158</words>
Rust flaked like old snow as he sang to the cylinder and counted the returning syllables on his knuckles. <words>177</words>
Each echo marked a mile of buried rail, a cartography of echoes for a future he might not share. <words>196</words>
Static dandelions bobbed in the radio wave garden, releasing seeds that tickled his teeth with remembered laughter. <words>213</words>
He lifted the coil to the fence and let a spark short-circuit the lock, because maps detest closed doors. <words>232</words>
Honesty, he knew, is a key you make by stripping your voice of varnish until metal shows. <words>249</words>
He whispered into the tower the thing he had never said: that he was here not to save Mara, but to confess how he had lost her. <words>276</words>
He had taught her the woods were certain, and the rails were a lie, and she had left him for motion anyway. <words>298</words>
When the truth left his mouth, the echoes shortened, and a path revealed itself across the thistle of antennas. <words>317</words>
The garden answered with despairing cheer, as if to say sorrow could still be useful if held without lies. <words>336</words>
Freed by honesty, he brushed the charcoal map with Mara's antique hairbrush, and the smudges cleared into towns and sidings. <words>356</words>
He saw the hospital among them, a small square where tracks converged like concerned hands around a sleeping bird. <words>375</words>
He walked the new line, counting steps to keep the beeps at bay, and arrived as the final room went quiet. <words>396</words>
His map lay artfully messy on the windowsill, as if chaos could stand in for the pulse that had retired. <words>416</words>
He told Mara's silence the truest thing, that the rails were never lies, only promises he was afraid to keep. <words>436</words>
And though grief clawed at him like brambles, he felt a gate swing, and the garden's signals braided into a path home. <words>458</words>
He folded the map, kissed the brush, and stepped into the dusk to finish mapping what time had begun. <words>477</words>
