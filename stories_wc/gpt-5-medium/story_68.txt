My tea timer began its gentle countdown as I booted the reimagined forum of an ancient Roman marketplace. <words>18</words>
Vendors hawked simulations of olives and gossip while the code beneath their carts snaked like aqueducts toward my waiting console. <words>38</words>
I am a hacker with a moral code, which in my trade is rarely common, yet necessary when ghosts ask favors. <words>59</words>
The ghost today wore the last rumor of a monster, a rebel whose name the governors burned from scrolls and mouths. <words>80</words>
To retrieve that name, I had adopted a patient ritual that avoided the spotlight and trusted small, stubborn signs. <words>99</words>
The first sign was my collection of bottle caps, each stamped with a city where the rumor had survived as a lullaby. <words>121</words>
I fanned them on my desk like denarii, and their ridges clicked in a pattern that matched the market stalls on my screen. <words>144</words>
The pattern led me to a broom seller with a cracked grin, whose wares included one broken rake handle, priced strangely high. <words>166</words>
I paid in caps and code, then examined the wood under the vendor's indifference, and found tiny inscriptions carved along a broken rake handle. <words>190</words>
My tea steeped on the windowsill, each minute a tide I could not slow, but the carvings spoke in crisp ripples. <words>211</words>
Through tiny inscriptions carved along a broken rake handle, the rebel had mapped a cipher onto the layout of the marketplace itself. <words>233</words>
Stall numbers became letters, gossip weighed values, and the path a careful shopper would adopt spelled a sentence hidden under ash. <words>254</words>
I traced it with the confidence of doubt, that razor of confident uncertainty that keeps a moralist from becoming a zealot. <words>275</words>
The sentence uncoiled: they called me monster because I refused to sell children with the grain, and I would not apologize. <words>296</words>
In the forum the rumor had always snarled with fangs, but these words grew hands, scraped, bled, and tried to hold. <words>317</words>
Humanizing the monster is not absolution; it is a way to see the cage and measure the jailer by its bars. <words>338</words>
The next carving gave a date, a grain tax riot, and a name deliberately scored shallow, so erasure would look like weather. <words>360</words>
I cross checked with museum scans, scraped monastic inventories, and bribed the market's physics with my caps until the letters cut air. <words>382</words>
When the timer chimed, the tea ready, I finally held the name in my mouth, and chose to adopt it publicly. <words>403</words>
I would wear it in court briefs, audits, and posts, keep their fight steeping in mine, a warmth nobody could confiscate. <words>424</words>
The marketplace applauded with scripted laughter, but somewhere under the code a record flipped from monster to neighbor, which felt like rescue. <words>446</words>
I packed my bottle caps, paid the broom seller again for luck, and walked out holding steam, a name, and unanswered certainty. <words>468</words>
