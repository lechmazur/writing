On the interstellar orchard ship migrating between galaxies, I was the lost apprentice pruning starfruit like a penitent comedian. <words>19</words>
My mentor, the shipmind, spoke with mocking affection, trimming my pride with jokes sharp enough to slice nebulae. <words>37</words>
It said I was privately open, a chest unlocked but still hugging its secrets, because my hands trembled at the hinges. <words>58</words>
To find freedom in self-acceptance, the shipmind suggested, I should gather stories the way trees catch light. <words>75</words>
So I raided the relic locker and found an old cordless phone, its cradle sticky with nectar and dust from Earth. <words>96</words>
The orchard had grown around it, a glasshouse jungle where apples hummed to gravity and vines braided the antenna. <words>115</words>
I pressed play and learned via the static-laden confessions on an old cordless phone how travelers drop the disguises that survive planets. <words>137</words>
That traveler's wisdom did not preach, it wheezed, giggled, wept, and once sang through the battery hiss like a kettle. <words>157</words>
A woman confessed she wore a clown nose to asteroids so no mineral could claim it did not laugh her back. <words>178</words>
An old pilot admitted he kissed the airlock before every takeoff, because he dreamt the void was a jealous cousin. <words>198</words>
I began to reverse-engineer myself from these scraps, mapping each confession to a knot in my posture or a bruise in my humor. <words>221</words>
The shipmind jeered and cheered in equal measure, telling me I was beautiful as a blueprint with tea stains. <words>240</words>
Outside, harvest drones combed the hull like bees, and the sails billowed across the promise of changing winds that smelled of magnetism. <words>262</words>
A bird's nest, fallen from our museum oak, floated in a containment bubble between rows of pears spiraling like tiny moons. <words>283</words>
I cupped it in gloved hands and found three blank eggs, mirrors for futures I might admit if I stopped performing. <words>304</words>
So I recorded my own message into the phone, my voice timid as dew, and laughed at myself before the laughter hurt me. <words>327</words>
I told it how being privately open means letting the door swing, yet choosing who gets tea while the kettle sings. <words>348</words>
I told it my destination was not a star but a seat at my own table, set for mistakes and second servings. <words>370</words>
The shipmind, ever the tutor, softened its mocking affection and marked my log complete with a blossom icon and a small applause. <words>392</words>
When the orchard ship turned toward new darkness, I tucked the phone into the nest and carried both to the observation deck. <words>414</words>
Across the glass, galaxies looked like unpicked fruit, and across the promise of changing winds I finally practiced being my own weather. <words>436</words>
No trick, no mask, just a lost apprentice who learned to grow, harvest, and eat his truth before the stars could judge. <words>458</words>
That was traveler's wisdom enough for me, and the shipmind agreed with a wink coded in photons I could finally bear. <words>479</words>
