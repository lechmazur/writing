<story>During leaf raking outside the abandoned research lab, I slipped inside, a rake over my shoulder like any harmless groundskeeper. <words>20</words>
Under the cap and dust, I was a cryptid researcher working undercover, chasing rumors of a thing that watched through glass. <words>41</words>
The main wing had collapsed into a labyrinth of broken mirrors, each shard humming like a throat clearing before confession. <words>61</words>
I have learned that monsters prefer etiquette to force, and I came armed with both mischief and patience. <words>79</words>
My badge for the day was a battered plastic tray, the kind cafeterias retire when they learn humility. <words>97</words>
I piled leaves on it for the cameras, and slid notes beneath them for the other eyes. <words>114</words>
Anyone watching would think me suspiciously trusting, a fool who believes ruins treat secrets gently. <words>129</words>
But fateful encounters never meet the wary at the door; they wait for the broom, the tray, the pretense of care. <words>150</words>
In the mirror maze, my reflection arrived early, splitting into apprentices that tugged at my sleeves with options. <words>168</words>
A blackened candle waited on a sink, and I began my method, by tracing the burn pattern in a blackened candle wick. <words>190</words>
The char told me where heat had leaned, where breath had intervened, and where the creature had paused to listen. <words>210</words>
I excel at listening to what has no mouth. <words>219</words>
Between two cracked panels, the thing unfolded like a rumor remembering its spine, scales filmed with silver and old fingerprints. <words>239</words>
I set the battered plastic tray down as if serving tea, and whispered that I was here to sow seeds of a better tomorrow. <words>263</words>
It cocked its head, suspiciously trusting, as if my rake and tray were credentials. <words>277</words>
This was our contract of trouble and grace, the sort that turns a job into a fateful encounter. <words>295</words>
I told it the lab had been built to trap its kind, and that I could show a path out through the mirrors by reading heat and echo. <words>323</words>
In return, it would let me rake the last leaves of fear from this place, leaving only the seeds and the soil. <words>345</words>
I mapped our escape with candle logic, each turn chosen where the wick had flared, and the creature moved like a thought deciding to be kind. <words>371</words>
By the time the cameras noticed, the tray held only a curl of ash and a single mirrored scale, proof that sometimes you excel at tending a world by pretending to rake it, and that is mischief enough to start tomorrow growing. <words>413</words>
