<story>The cobalt glade at dusk hummed like a held breath, leaf-veins lit with residual lightning from tomorrow. [17]
I was a root-bound visionary, literally grafted to an old mapletree, and figuratively to consequences not yet tallied. [35]
After the future arrives early, you learn which promises bloom and which wither under that rush of unreal time. [54]
Our eclipsed covenant was one of the withering kind, a vow made at noon and unmade at shadow. [72]
The sun went black that midday, and the oath we tied to its circle slipped loose like a ring in sudden cold. [94]
So I remained, roots in my ankles and questions in my ribs, purposefully curious about the shape of the breach. [114]
I had one object left from before, a maze topiary clipping wrapped in wax paper and rumor. [131]
It carried the scent of clipped decisions, a labyrinth nested within chlorophyll, a blueprint for escaping the garden by walking it. [152]
I tucked it behind my ear like a pilgrim pin, and the leaves whispered instructions I could almost heed. [171]
Almost, because the covenant had eclipsed, and its shadow moved faster than any tongue. [185]
People found me anyway, passengers who tumbled out of the arriving future with burns in the shape of hours. [204]
They were blistered by possibilities, and they wanted what I wanted, to find the intersection of dreams. [221]
One woman had a scar running from her temple to her wrist, a silver gull of healed storm across the body. [242]
She told me there was a way to share maps now, not with ink but by linking through scars. [261]
When skin remembers, she said, it makes bridges that light can cross, even when oaths go dark. [278]
I did not argue; the anxious elation of a nearly answered question made me brave and foolish in equal measure. [298]
She pressed her wrist to the bark where my own grafts showed, and our old harms fit together like puzzle edges. [319]
We saw the same thing, a corridor of hedges bending to form a question mark around a pool of night. [339]
In the pool were reflections that did not belong to either of us, but to the promise that once tied us to the sun. [363]
Behind the hedges stood figures in ceremonial pruning aprons, those who had drafted the eclipsed covenant and now hid among their geometries. [385]
They had not expected the future to arrive early, and they certainly had not expected the garden to start thinking for itself. [407]
Hedges had grown words, and words had become doors, and doors demanded answers before opening. [422]
The woman's scar tingled against my grafts, and a path unfurled under our joined pain like a ribbon pulled from a mouth. [444]
We followed until the ribbon led back to the pool, which now held not night but the mirrored spiral of a maze seed. [467]
I took the maze topiary clipping from my ear and laid it on the water, and it did not sink. [487]
Instead it rooted, paper dissolving into wet dust, stem dividing into entrances and exits, a living diagram of maybe. [506]
Voices rose from the hedges, warning us not to meddle, but the leaves kept whispering, and this time I chose to heed. [528]
We stepped onto the floating maze, and it accepted our weight like a question accepts an earnest try. [546]
At each turn we pressed skin to bark, linking through scars to borrow the courage of those who had walked this path in other timelines. [571]
Anxious elation steadied me, a paradox you can lean on because it leans back, jittering but firm. [588]
We found the gardeners at the heart, clipped into silhouettes by their own shears, waiting beside a sundial that told only tides. [610]
They wanted the clipping back, the garden quiet, the covenant restored to its noon and never questioned. [627]
We told them no, because the future had arrived early and knocked down the scaffolding, and the blue hour would not be unmade. [650]
Instead we offered a new vow, not circular but braided, a promise to reopen doors whenever hedges tried to speak. [670]
We sealed it not with sun but with skin, our palms pressed to the mapletree, our agreement recorded in cambium. [690]
The corridor opened, and the mirrored pool rose like a plate, showing a crossroads where two dreams met and overlapped and curved onward. [713]
Those dreams were the garden and the people, their fears and their ambitions, not enemies but lines seeking a shared vertex. [734]
We stepped into that intersection, and the maze reconfigured, less a trap than a grammar, teaching us how to say yes without erasing no. [758]
The gardeners lowered their shears, and the pruning aprons softened into capes, and the sundial agreed to tell time again, sometimes. [779]
When we left the cobalt glade at dusk, it was still dusk, and the border of waking and dreaming blurred. [799]</story>
