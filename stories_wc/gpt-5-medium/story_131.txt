I am an aloof orphan who prefers clear surfaces and quiet air, yet today the garage droned around me like a restless, softly audible hive. <words>25</words>
Since last winter, a local gravitational anomaly had warped our street, tilting shelves, lengthening shadows, and turning garage cleaning into a slow ballet of drifting screws. <words>51</words>
I opened a mildewed box and found my foster mother's collection of smooth stones, each labeled with a year, a tide, and a tremor. <words>75</words>
She used to say adapt or perish, then smile like a lighthouse, and I would nod without believing, because belief always felt like handing someone my throat. <words>102</words>
Now, throughout garage cleaning, the stones shivered upward and settled again, as if remembering the river that polished them into oval vows. <words>124</words>
I wanted to transform fear into courage, or at least to reframe the static in my chest as weather that could be read and prepared for. <words>150</words>
In the toolbox I found a cryptic message scrawled on a lottery ticket, folded into a paper moth that kept landing near the stones. <words>174</words>
I read it with affectionate detachment, because hope is a solvent that can loosen bolts you did not intend to turn, and secrets prefer tightness. <words>199</words>
The moth's wings said, Keep what floats, release what sinks, meet me where gravity falters, signed only with two initials that matched nobody I knew. <words>224</words>
The message did not startle me; it confirmed the garage's harbor logic within the gravitational anomaly, and that harbors demand tides, even counterfeit ones. <words>248</words>
I arranged the collection of smooth stones in a spiral on the oil-stained floor, a constellation for housebound sailors, and the screws drifted toward it. <words>273</words>
A softly audible hum gathered, not from machines, but from the weighted patience of everything that wanted to fall, and was bravely deciding not to. <words>298</words>
The initials matched the name I never used, the one from the group home, and I realized I had mailed myself this dare months ago. <words>323</words>
I was the author and the audience, inviting myself to adapt or perish, to release the anchor stones and see which stories still chose me. <words>348</words>
So I loosen the blue twine that held their labels, let the dates slough away, and feed the spiral to the room's slow whirlpool. <words>372</words>
The stones lift and settle in alternating waves, forming a pathway of pauses to the doorway, where a moth waits like a small, believable miracle. <words>397</words>
I step through with affectionate detachment, carrying nothing but breath, and feel fear loosen, not vanish, yet lean toward courage as if taught by gravity. <words>422</words>
