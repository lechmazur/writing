I woke in the abandoned circus dressing room as the mirrors blinked with the sleepy patience of captive moons. <words>19</words>
Outside, time stretched across the hush of dawn's second breath, and the dust motes rehearsed their tiny, serious pirouettes. <words>38</words>
I had come as a tortured protector, though my ward was not a child but a cracked porcelain doll cradled in linen. <words>60</words>
Its smile was suspiciously sweet, like caramel on a blade, and it watched me with fractures that mapped forgotten countries. <words>80</words>
I joked to the peeling wallpaper that I preferred my company cracked, and the wallpaper flaked off in amused applause. <words>100</words>
But I was only buying courage to confront the unknown that had shepherded me here. <words>115</words>
Two nights ago, a chance encounter at a planetarium show rewired my orbit. <words>128</words>
A woman with comet freckles sat beside me and whispered, suspiciously sweet, that some stars are just holes where fate leaks. <words>149</words>
She pressed the doll into my arms when the projector chose to unleash a storm of myths, and then she vanished like smoke. <words>172</words>
I knew, by the ache that tucked itself under my ribs, that this was a summons I had once refused. <words>192</words>
So I followed the map of hairline fractures to this room, where costumes hung like startled birds and the clocks forgot to tick. <words>215</words>
My duty returned with playful seriousness, a carnival of vows performing somersaults over the quiet fear inside my chest. <words>234</words>
I vowed to embrace a fate once denied, to be the hinge that lets a sealed door breathe. <words>252</words>
The doll's glass eyes rolled north, then down, and I realized it was not helpless but waiting for me to translate. <words>273</words>
When I listened, the cracks became a star chart, and the scattered constellations traced the outline of my own trembling hands. <words>294</words>
They told me that guardianship is not a cage but a lighthouse that shines until the fog learns to glow. <words>314</words>
I laughed once, a soft circus drumbeat, and promised the watching mirrors I would usher the strangers hiding inside me into daylight. <words>336</words>
With a kiss to the doll's suspiciously sweet smile, I cracked the window and let the dawn's second breath braid my courage. <words>358</words>
From somewhere in the tented distance, a calliope tuned itself, uncertain yet eager, as if waiting for me to cue the show. <words>380</words>
I lifted the doll, and in that lift I felt the universe index its pages and hold open the one that hurt most. <words>403</words>
I stepped forward to confront the unknown, ready to unleash tenderness like a well trained animal finally released into its natural circus ring. <words>426</words>
My fate did not strike but curtsied, and I, tortured protector, returned the bow and led us both through the blinking doorway. <words>448</words>
Together we crossed the dressing room's threshold, carrying our cracked constellations like candy and knives, and laughing carefully into the new day. <words>470</words>
