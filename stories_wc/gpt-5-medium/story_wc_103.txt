<story>I entered the living bridge garden with trembling notes scribbled inside my palm, ink sweating like dew. [17]
I am a hedge maze designer, but today my hedges are woven from roots that walk above streams. [35]
The bridges grow where footprints wish to be, arcing in ribs and knots like a patient skeleton training itself. [54]
I have come here to discover the texture of time, to feel its nap, its snag, its hidden burrs. [73]
A halo fragment hangs at my throat, a curved shard the color of dim dawn, humming like a restrained bell. [93]
I found it wedged in an ash tree that lightning had carved into a harp of blackened ribs. [111]
Touching it wakes scenes I did not live, as if the air itself keeps fading photographs in a cautious album. [131]
When I press the shard, the garden reorganizes through hyperbolic geometry, every curve birthing more curve, endlessly splaying like coral. [151]
Distances multiply and fold, and I feel retrocognitively trapped inside someone else's yesterday, breathing their damp astonishment. [168]
Paths elongate into whispers and the whispers tighten into stairs, and the stairs end where they begin. [185]
I recognize my own first blueprint etched across a leaf, but the ink swims, thinning like tea in riverwater. [204]
The blueprint shows a looped labyrinth whose exits pair with entrances, a tangle planned to guide grief into singing. [223]
I designed it after the fire that disintegrated a library, when soot learned to speak in my breathing. [241]
The halo fragment vibrates harder, and a bridge thickens beneath me, braiding itself with impatient green purpose. [258]
It carries me toward a pavilion grown from willow domes, each rib alive with ants stitching sun to shade. [277]
A woman stands there, not alive, not dead, as if the timeframe is none and she is purely interval. [296]
Her dress is made of lichen threaded with rain, and her eyes are developed negatives, pale and reversed. [314]
She says my name the way a path might say it when forgotten, syllables fallen into moss to keep warm. [334]
I do not remember teaching the garden to speak, but what else is a maze but an articulate hesitation. [353]
The woman points to a root arch loaded with small frames, each a fading photograph strung like prayer flags. [372]
Faces inside them sink as if the emulsion remembers melting, and some hold my own hands catching sap. [390]
The frames swing, and the air thickens into pages I can turn by walking, slow and shaking. [407]
I step, and the page crushes open into a morning where my father measures hedges with a carpenter's hunger. [426]
He looks up at the infant me and says, Count the angles until you hear a circle breathe. [444]
The page flips without wind, and now the fire licks the library rafters, reading faster than I could. [462]
I hold buckets that disintegrate into steam, and the letters rise like gnats, then settle as soot in me. [481]
I cannot snatch the past without tearing it, and so it traps me by teaching me its shock. [499]
The woman watches, her lichen dress soaking smoke that never quite exists, and says, You stitched grief into paths. [518]
I answer, I was trying to give it exits, but exits always end as mouths that ask for more steps. [538]
The bridges tremble, and through hyperbolic geometry the pavilion becomes a cathedral that cannot close its wings. [555]
I clutch the halo fragment and feel the pressure of beings who once crowned themselves with circles to be forgiven. [575]
Forgiveness is a labyrinth too, one that returns you to the first question, untouched, but quaking with reverie. [593]
I put the shard to my tongue, tasting iron, sap, and the hush of rain rehearsing futures it will not choose. [614]
The garden answers by growing a bridge that descends into the water and continues under it like a submerged sentence. [634]
I follow, lungs holding the pale roar, and find a vault of roots braided into rooms that echo with footprints. [654]
In one room a child practices hesitation, counting angles, hearing a circle breathe, and I understand he is me looking forward. [675]
In another room the library is unburned, and the books pulse, spines like sleeping animals, awaiting a calmer weather. [694]
I kiss the wordless covers and feel their pages begin to disintegrate into birds that settle on my shoulders. [713]
The woman appears beside me and says the cost is to accept that the present is a continual photograph fading. [733]
I say the cost is welcome if I can read its texture, rough as weathered bark and smooth as breath. [753]
She nods, and the halo fragment brightens, no longer shard but ring, and its light lays a path. [771]
When I step onto it, every bridge above me hums and the garden blooms into quaking reverie that holds still. [791]</story>
