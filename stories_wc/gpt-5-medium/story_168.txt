By the time our van rattled onto the moor, the mysterious stone circle was already humming with unsanctioned but courteous music. <words>21</words>
Mara, a ruthless flower arranger with a smile like a sealed envelope, clicked on her headlamp and examined the rocks as if pruning stems. <words>45</words>
She tucked a scuffed plastic comb behind her ear, a tool for teasing patterns from shadows and petals alike. <words>64</words>
I was the watcher, carrying the watcher's burden: to see without interfering, to notice when nobody else dared, and to remember kindly. <words>86</words>
From the festival tent downhill, a singer breathed vowels into the night; in the pause between a singer's verses, Mara spoke. <words>107</words>
Let's be gentle trespassers, she said, anarchists with apologies ready, and leave the place neater than we find it. <words>126</words>
Her mind, intellectually spontaneous, skipped like a pebble across possibilities, because she had come to decode the rock art before daylight muddled it. <words>149</words>
We had rehearsed the riddle through spontaneous road trip conversations, mapping motifs to river bends, stars, migrations, and the scent of crushed thyme. <words>172</words>
Now, she asked me to distinguish lichen from scoring, erosion from intention, speech from echo. <words>187</words>
While I traced grooves with a glove, she arranged wind-bruised wildflowers into impermanent constellations, ruthless in symmetry, tender in the aftermath. <words>208</words>
She used the comb as a ruler, its scuffed teeth measuring repeats like a refrain, its spine tapping a metronome for thought. <words>230</words>
When the singer fell silent again, that slim pause unfurled, and Mara's eyes brightened with a theory that behaved like polite anarchy. <words>252</words>
The carvers, she said, cataloged trespass as a rite, guiding caretakers to break small rules for larger care, a choreography of entry. <words>274</words>
If we move a flower here, shift our footing there, and breathe together once, the next line will unlock into an itinerary. <words>296</words>
We followed her sentence as if it were law, and the grooves cohered into a map pointing toward a chalk road hidden by gorse. <words>320</words>
We drove there in slow arcs, keeping headlights low, continuing our method through spontaneous road trip conversations that braided folklore with geology. <words>342</words>
The chalk opened onto another ring of stones, smaller and sharper, where the rock art repeated but with omissions that felt intentional. <words>364</words>
I laid my coat across a forbidden path so snails could cross, and kept watch while Mara trimmed nettles with ruthless grace. <words>386</words>
Between the singer's distant verses, we distinguished the final pattern: a message to watchers to bear burdens lightly by sharing them. <words>407</words>
Mara left the scuffed plastic comb balanced on the capstone like a courteous key, and the circle, satisfied, exhaled us back to the road. <words>431</words>
