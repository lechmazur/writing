In the hush as the last parade float disappears, the secret society meeting hall hums like a held breath. <words>19</words>
I arrive late, a grieving miner carrying a tiny bell, silent in my pocket like a superstition that forgot its sound. <words>40</words>
They call us the Ledger, because our charter is to chronicle technological shifts without worship or hate, only careful observations salted with jokes to keep us human. <words>67</words>
That is the rule, and I obey it with a face some accuse of being passionately indifferent, though the indifference is a dam and the passion the flood behind it. <words>97</words>
On the dais, Kira sets an antique drill beside a gleaming drone, then nods to me as if to coax a ghost into speaking through ordinary lungs. <words>124</words>
I open my notebook and the room dims, not by lighting but via after-images from persistent nightmares that trail my vision like miners trailing the last cart of ore. <words>153</words>
In those spectral echoes, my brother still laughs, wearing the old carbide lamp, before the new auto-rig decided it could taste rock better than flesh. <words>178</words>
I speak carefully, weighing levity like a feather on sorrow's scale, because the Ledger prefers poignant levity to the clanging gongs of blame. <words>201</words>
Our minutes must be clean, not spotless, but honest enough that future readers can smell the oil and hear my brother's laugh, though my bell refuses to. <words>228</words>
I set the tiny bell, silent, on the table, an anchor that never rings, and I read aloud the list of upgrades that replaced hands with algorithms. <words>255</words>
Each entry is small, but cumulative, like sips becoming a river: pressure sensors, predictive maintenance, swarm carts, and the cheerful voice that announces errors as if offering sweets. <words>283</words>
Kira asks where the data comes from, and I answer that the most faithful graphs are drawn by eyelids, and inked by the tremor of waking. <words>309</words>
The room chuckles at that, and I am grateful, because their laughter is gentle, a lamp low enough to coax the canary in my chest to breathe again. <words>337</words>
We vote to send tonight's minutes to the archive, unchanged, and I sign with a hand that is steady only because the bell's silence steadies it. <words>363</words>
Outside, the crowd has thinned to confetti and footsteps, and the city feels briefly new, in the hush as the last parade float disappears down a wetly lit street. <words>392</words>
I pocket the minutes beside the bell and walk home, passionately indifferent to applause, yet fully alive to the clinkless weight that keeps our record honest and my brother near. <words>422</words>
