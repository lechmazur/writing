After the last glacier melts, the lake swallows a palace whose chandeliers still glimmer beneath hard, blue silence. <words>18</words>
They call it a submerged palace in a cursed lake, and I am the daydreaming scholar who studies its hush. <words>38</words>
My pulse is seldom regular, as if the water keeps time with tides no calendar remembers. <words>54</words>
I dive carrying a sliver of a crashed meteor-bound satellite, a bright blade relic that hums when memory rubs against it. <words>75</words>
I want to create a masterpiece that inspires generations, not with marble or ink, but with motion that obediently forgets me. <words>96</words>
The palace floor was once a skating rink, forgotten when the curse seeded a lake over the royal ballroom. <words>115</words>
I promote threads of compassion through coded scuff marks in a forgotten skating rink, teaching the currents to carry kindness like lanterns. <words>137</words>
The method is primitive and pure, a choreography of abrasions the resident moonfish read with their slow, lunar eyes. <words>156</words>
Each scratch is a letter, each glide a syntax, and when the silt lifts, sentences flex like vines toward breath. <words>176</words>
I learned the code from wind lashed notebooks, from murals that peeled into lace, from dreams that insisted on pristine chaos. <words>197</words>
The curse does not rage; it arranges, stacking fallen mirrors and bones so neatly that the terror feels like etiquette. <words>217</words>
In that etiquette I skate with my hands, guiding the satellite sliver to bruise stories into marble glazed with algae. <words>237</words>
A boy once drowned here trying to save a fox, and I abrade a map that lets foxes find boys before ice can trick them. <words>262</words>
Lovers now separated by rafts will read the swirls as routes, and storms will pause to parse the plea I tuck at their center. <words>286</words>
Because I am a daydreaming scholar, my examples arrive as metaphors first, then as measurable currents drawn by neighborly gravity. <words>306</words>
Even the seldom regular pulse of the lake adapts, syncing to the steady mercy I carve into the rink like a bell. <words>328</words>
When I rest, bubbles collect on my eyelids like punctuation, and the palace breathes me into its sentences. <words>346</words>
I test the opus by sending a finned apprentice through the sequence, a young diver who mistrusts hope until the walls answer. <words>368</words>
He returns with a suit pocket full of rescued letters from rafts, each stamped with gratitude I did not author. <words>388</words>
The moonfish circle my scars, and the fox I could not save visits in a thin, forgiving ripple that smooths my wrists. <words>410</words>
The masterpiece is not a monument but a circulation, a grammar that turns fear into passage and solitude into braid. <words>430</words>
I promote it only by absence, letting the coded scuff marks travel farther than my name, farther than this lake. <words>450</words>
After the last glacier melts, what remains is the willingness of waters to practice empathy when taught a patient dance. <words>470</words>
If generations touch these threads of compassion, their hands will surface clean, shining with the palace quiet that forgives. <words>489</words>
