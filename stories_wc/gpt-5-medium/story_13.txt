The solemn swordsman climbed the tilted ribs of a toppled clock tower, steady as a metronome with a broken spring. <words>20</words>
At the summit waited a magician's laboratory in a toppled clock tower, glass organs chiming whenever stray wind threaded their throats. <words>41</words>
Outside, the desert rearranged itself while shifting sands erase footprints, as if time kept revising its own hesitant paragraphs. <words>60</words>
He had come with mild fervor to track evolutionary changes in flora rumored to bloom inside a hidden annex of this ruin. <words>82</words>
Clutched to his chest was a basic wooden box and a trail of poems leading to a secret garden, handwritten by a vanished botanist. <words>106</words>
Inside the box lay seed lenses, soil flutes, and a compass that could localize scent, though its needle twitched like a frightened moth. <words>129</words>
Every device in the laboratory was functionally dysfunctional, ingenious yet exasperating, as if the magician had worshiped error to coax invention. <words>150</words>
The first poem pinned to a beaker rack told him to breathe the dust, listen, and follow the clicking where the dead seconds gather. <words>174</words>
The solemn swordsman obeyed, and the clicks braided into meter, guiding his steps across gears scarred by lightning and old scholarly quarrels. <words>196</words>
A folded verse inside a cracked lens invited him to descend a rope of kelp into the belly, where a glassless greenhouse whispered. <words>219</words>
There he found the secret garden, roofed by stormlight, its beds stitched with vines that learned faster than schools and changed between blinks. <words>242</words>
Garden wisdom emanated from their leaves, a music of adjustment, a grammar of survival that rewrote the mouth of every creature that tasted them. <words>266</words>
He knelt to track evolutionary changes, calibrating rings of color on petals that predicted drought, and mapping how roots rerouted memory around broken pottery. <words>290</words>
Each poem along the plot stakes proved a hypothesis, and the vanished botanist felt present, a teacher whose chalk had turned into dandelion clocks. <words>314</words>
Once a courier of duels, he had left campaigns behind after watching armor rust into soil, convinced blades should now defend green experiments. <words>337</words>
So he tuned the laboratory's functionally dysfunctional guardians, coaxing a failing bell to ring only when marauders spoke in lies. <words>357</words>
He used the compass to localize the scents of mutations, bottling their intervals, while shifting sands erase footprints of his own restless route. <words>380</words>
The basic wooden box, scuffed like a veteran, received seeds, sketches, and a single tear shed when a vine remembered the face of rain. <words>404</words>
With mild fervor he realized garden wisdom was iterative compassion, the patient treaty between hunger and habitat, and he swore to steward its language. <words>428</words>
Before departing, he localized his findings into fresh verses and extended the trail of poems leading to a secret garden for the next pilgrim. <words>452</words>
