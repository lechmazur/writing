I speak with spirits for a living, but I do not believe them easily. <words>14</words>
Tonight I follow their rumor into an iridescent cave inside a giant crystal geode beneath the boardwalk. <words>31</words>
Above us, during the hush when a roller coaster stalls at its peak, the silence fits the cave like a held breath. <words>53</words>
I practice a brazen humility, admitting ignorance while shoving open doors that claim to be rusted shut. <words>70</words>
I am a skeptical spiritual medium, a contradiction polished by years of false knocks and rare truths. <words>87</words>
I came here to learn forgotten crafts, the lost stitchings by which ancients taught stones to remember rain. <words>105</words>
On my belt hangs a centaur horseshoe with runes, ferric and heavy, its edges nibbled by stars. <words>122</words>
The shoe is both key and doubt, proof that mythology limps into hardware when the world refuses clarity. <words>140</words>
Mists of uncertainty curl through the geode, iridescent veils that turn my lamp into a wandering rumor. <words>157</words>
Here the echoes are peculiarly frequent, like someone coughing politely from many centuries at once. <words>172</words>
I open my satchel and breathe the scent of a new book, glue and paper tasting of promise. <words>190</words>
By the scent of a new book, the skeptic in me and the seer in me strengthen a truce, trembling but serviceable. <words>212</words>
I press the runes against the crystal wall, and somewhere hooves start counting, a measured clatter of invitation. <words>230</words>
The roller coaster above hangs like a question mark, letting the world hold its breath long enough for answers. <words>249</words>
From the shimmer steps a figure, neither horse nor man, but the memory of a centaur blacksmith. <words>266</words>
I bow with brazen humility and declare I doubt everything, yet I beg to be taught anyway. <words>283</words>
The blacksmith laughs like river stones and asks what craft I deserve, and what ignorance I will surrender. <words>301</words>
I answer that I want the craft of shaping mists of uncertainty into ropes that pull truth closer. <words>319</words>
He shows me how to wind fog through the horseshoe, each rune a spindle, each breath a loom. <words>337</words>
When the strands falter, I inhale the new book again to strengthen the line, binding curiosity to caution. <words>355</words>
The peculiarly frequent stalls of the ride click above, a metronome by which patience keeps hammering. <words>371</words>
Under that rhythm, I learn to solder raindrops, to braid echoes, to temper doubt until it rings clean. <words>389</words>
Then the roller coaster lurches forward, and the hush shatters, and the blacksmith fades like breath on glass. <words>407</words>
I leave the iridescent cave steadied, my skepticism brighter for its scars, my humility louder for its teeth, carrying the horseshoe and a beginner's first rope of certainty. <words>435</words>
