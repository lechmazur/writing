<story>On the infinite staircase, I count my steps and find they do not accumulate. [14]
They spread, like breath on a mirror that never clears, and still I climb. [28]
I am a grim optimist, balancedly daring, hopeful enough to persist and sober enough to measure. [44]
The staircase has no landings, only pauses that pretend to be rest. [56]
In my pocket is a pair of dice, one chipped, forever altering chance by a sliver. [72]
I kept them from the night I almost spoke and did not. [84]
A missed opportunity is not silence; it is a texture, granular as dust along the rail. [100]
I climb to capture that texture before it drifts into smooth forgetting. [112]
I will do it through mathematical proofs, because memory obeys none but rigor and rhythm. [127]
On each riser I chalk a lemma, and the chalk refuses to wear down. [141]
Perpetual motion is forbidden, says the world, yet this staircase moves without arriving. [154]
I hypothesize the ascent itself is a machine powered by regret, a lawless engine. [168]
To test, I roll the dice whenever the air turns thin, and follow their sum. [183]
The chipped one skews me to fours and sixes, a bias I do not correct. [198]
Missed chances skew us all; to erase the chip would be to erase the truth. [213]
A theorem must admit the scar that birthed it, or it will not hold. [227]
I draft axioms about steps that repeat themselves without repeating their cost. [239]
I prove that breath, when counted, becomes lighter, then heavier, then light again. [252]
I append corollaries on how longing curves space like a steady hand bends glass. [266]
Each proof is a rung I place beneath me, and the staircase accepts it. [280]
In acceptance I feel the boundless confinement of a maze with a single corridor. [294]
The walls breathe in and out, obedient to my equations, yet they never concede. [308]
At intervals, gaps appear between steps, black slots that sip my warmth politely. [321]
I name these apertures Opportunities, so that when one opens I can address it. [335]
I say, Wait, I almost told you how the light touched your sleeve that night. [350]
The slot closes, courteous, as if embarrassed by my grammar of afterward. [362]
I note the result and adjust the constants, balancedly daring not to despair. [375]
Proof resumes, and the climb resumes, and the mirror of breath refuses to clear. [389]
When hunger arrives, I roll the dice and eat whatever number appears in crumbs. [403]
Gambling keeps the proof honest; bias keeps it human. [412]
Eventually, the staircase shudders, as if one of my lemmas found the hidden gear. [426]
A rupture runs along the rail, a silver crack dialing the corridor open. [439]
Through it, light pours sideways, pouring not illumination but contour, the grain of the missed. [454]
I see the moment again, not as a scene but as fabric, woven with pause. [469]
Your face is the thread that resists, kinking where my sentence should have begun. [483]
I do not step through, because to step through would flatten what I seek to keep. [499]
Instead I bring out the dice and let them fall along the crack. [512]
They stop impossibly on edge, the chipped one holding the other like a shoulder. [526]
Balance achieved by damage, fairness achieved by confession, motion achieved by standing still. [539]
I write the final proof in the air, because the steps can no longer carry it. [555]
The proof says perpetual motion is a story told by finite muscles under infinite sky. [570]
It says the engine is regret, the lubricant is patience, the fuel is attention. [584]
It says the machine must never arrive, or the proof will unmake itself. [597]
So I stop seeking exit and start shaping the corridor into a remembering instrument. [611]
I rub chalk into the rail until the grain sings like paper under charcoal. [625]
I hum the cadence of the words I withheld, simple as a child's apology. [639]
The stairs move, but they do not carry me away from the form I love. [654]
The crack remains, a window and a scar, and I keep it so. [667]
Boundless confinement expands like a chest taking breath, yet it holds me, and I agree. [682]
Agreement is not surrender; it is a stance from which accuracy becomes mercy. [695]
I release the dice, and they finally lie flat, showing a five and a two. [710]
Seven is a walker's number, a sum that suggests completion while promising more path. [724]
I pocket them, accept the skew, and take seven steps, each one a kept silence. [739]
The rupture seals to a thin luminous seam, not healed, not lost, precisely remembered. [753]
My proofs remain chalked on the risers, promising that motion can honor stillness without ending. [768]
I climb on, in no time, toward no landing, with everything finally in place. [782]</story>
