<story>I am a dog walker for the ultra-rich, but the dogs are not the most haunted creatures I meet. <words>19</words>
At the hour when color bleeds from day into night, I unlock the hilltop estate and face its yawning mansion. <words>39</words>
Tonight the haunted mansion dining room waits behind a velvet rope, laid for a banquet no living chef would claim. <words>59</words>
Crystal domes display a botanical collection of carnivorous blooms, each labeled in a hand that trembles across time. <words>77</words>
The house presses a loud silence against my ribs, a hush so heavy the dogs heel without command. <words>95</words>
I move with a carefully careless gait, the practiced sway of a servant who knows what not to know. <words>114</words>
It is my private vow to stand where fear dares not tread, because someone must map the forbidden corridors. <words>133</words>
My clients speak in silent agreements, tipping me to routes, to rumors, to the rooms they pretend to ignore. <words>152</words>
An encounter at a blood drive earned me this night, when a pale heiress watched me volunteer and slipped me a key. <words>174</words>
She said the house feeds on promises, and asked me to justify my courage with witness, not bravado. <words>192</words>
So I lead the hounds into the dining room and count thirteen chairs, each carved with a different, watchful leaf. <words>212</words>
Under glass, the botanical collection sways without breeze, as if exhaling the names of patrons who paid with memories. <words>231</words>
I set silver bowls, and the dogs stare at empty plates, honoring silent agreements no contract would dare write. <words>250</words>
The heiress enters like a candle turned sideways, thin and wavering, and the entire table flutters as though relieved. <words>269</words>
She nods to me, asking again with her eyes that I justify being here, not with words but with steadiness. <words>289</words>
I tie the leashes to a candelabrum, a carefully careless knot that would fail if panic chose the room. <words>308</words>
From the carnivorous throats rise perfumed shades, guests of the house distilled from cuttings the family watered with their secrets. <words>328</words>
The loud silence roars as they sit, and I understand my purpose is to stand where fear dares not tread, unmoving. <words>349</words>
Each ghost drinks starlight from empty crystal, and the heiress pricks her finger, recalling the blood drive where we first spoke. <words>370</words>
She had said then that donors trade hours for lives, and that my hours could map a house hungry for ours. <words>391</words>
I justify myself by serving the unseen: I lift lids, bow, wait, and in return they leave the dogs and me untouched by frost. <words>415</words>
Our silent agreements stack like porcelain, fragile currency that buys a corridorâ€™s safe passage one careful course at a time. <words>435</words>
I see the labels change to names I know, clients who tipped me to rumors so their own shadows would eat elsewhere. <words>457</words>
The heiress leans close and whispers that her dog died years ago, and asks if I can walk her absence instead. <words>478</words>
I nod, a carefully careless nod, and we seal it, the loudest silence I have ever kept. <words>495</words>
