At the hush in a barbershop after the last trim of the day, the Moon itself seemed to hold its breath. <words>21</words>
Beyond the mirror, a thin partition separated clippers from consoles, for this barbershop leaned against the lunar colony command center. <words>41</words>
A skittish drifter called Rook watched hair settle like gray regolith, his hands pocketing a pair of worn ballet shoes. <words>61</words>
He had come with rustic refinement and a private question: to discover the power of the subconscious mind. <words>79</words>
The barber swept, then paused, as if the broom were a shuttle held above a loom awaiting its next passage. <words>99</words>
Under that pause, the command center hummed, telemetry ticking like knitting needles, reports unraveling into whispers of fatigue and drifting dreams. <words>120</words>
Rook stood, his voice dramatically understated, and asked whether the partition door might open for a minute of quiet work. <words>140</words>
The barber, who moonlighted as communications tech, tilted the sign to Closed and guided Rook into the lunar colony command center. <words>161</words>
Banks of screens showed the colony's morale sagging after long shifts, as if the warp and weft of attention had parted. <words>182</words>
Rook set the worn ballet shoes on a console, their satin scuffed by corridors on Earth he barely remembered. <words>201</words>
He said he would pioneer a steadier channel for the colony by reconnecting parted threads in a loom's warp and weft. <words>222</words>
They led him to the signal loom, a web of fiber and memory that steered telemetry and tangled quietly with sleeping minds. <words>244</words>
Rook breathed, slipped one shoe onto his left hand like a glove, and traced the threads with small, respectful motions. <words>264</words>
He worked by listening to the hush that still clung from the barbershop, summoning grace without fanfare from the rhythm beneath attention. <words>286</words>
A faint waltz entered the telemetry, not music exactly, but a balance that let each drifting operator feel their steps align. <words>307</words>
Within that balance, the subconscious offered maps of micrometeor streams, sketching routes nobody awake could calculate before the hazard grew near. <words>328</words>
Rook knew the shapes by feel, as if his mother had taught him plies of data, and he followed, quietly pioneering resilience. <words>350</words>
The commander watched with a rancher's patience and offered only a nod, a dramatically understated salute to the summoning of grace. <words>371</words>
Reports steadied, screens breathed easier, and the colony felt held together again, like a fence mended with the exact right knot. <words>392</words>
Rook picked up the ballet shoes, thanked the barber, and returned to the cooling chairs, knowing his subconscious had taught his hands to mend. <words>416</words>
