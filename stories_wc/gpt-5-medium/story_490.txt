After the waves recede from a deserted shore, the caravan repair station inhales salt like a tired accordion. <words>18</words>
I am its fading caretaker, flickering at my edges like a sign that refuses to quit or quite glow. <words>37</words>
The parking bays hold skeletal wagons, husks of journeys paused midway through forever, while gulls circle with bureaucratic shrieks. <words>56</words>
I keep a dried lavender bundle tucked in my vest, a failing lighthouse of scent against rust and ghost fuel. <words>76</words>
My duty is inventory, repairs, and guarding a locked terminal no traveler mentions, the station secret everyone politely forgets. <words>95</words>
Enthusiastic apathy keeps me steady, a cheerfully numb patience that welcomes tasks while doubting their point with a grin. <words>114</words>
But the allure of the forbidden grows louder in the silence, playing scales on my nerves like practiced rain. <words>133</words>
The locked terminal promises that unknown, and I want to cradle the unknown like a newborn galaxy before coffee cools. <words>153</words>
So I plan my approach with a methodically random ritual, a coin toss followed by thirty measured steps and one sigh. <words>174</words>
I wipe the screen with lavender dust, because scents are keys here, and memories open cleaner than passwords. <words>192</words>
Then I gorge on courage, which tastes like old batteries and tea, and coax the machine awake with my first question. <words>213</words>
The terminal replies in tidal whispers, as if reluctant to be shore, then offers a directory labeled ancient archives. <words>232</words>
I laugh with enthusiastic apathy again, because hope is inefficient, and select Entry Zero by hacking ancient archives the slow way. <words>253</words>
A map unfurls, not of lands but of rumors, caravans drawn as constellations winking beside repair codes and funeral dates. <words>273</words>
I see my own station marked with a smile that looks like a warning, and the tide line blinking green. <words>293</words>
The entry explains that when the waves recede, salvagers arrive with questions and leave with fewer, because the shore edits. <words>313</words>
It advises a caretaker to forget openings and remember closures, but my memory is a sieve that keeps only glitter. <words>333</words>
So I unfasten the terminal deeper and gorge on cataloged myths, eating line breaks, swallowing timestamps, drinking coordinates like rain. <words>353</words>
Out spills a schematic for strangers who build caravans that run on questions, and a note addressed to the fading caretaker. <words>374</words>
It claims I was hired to halt curiosity until it ripened, then release it with lavender, metal, and an almost smile. <words>395</words>
I do not believe letters, but I believe the room, and it leans toward me like a caravan seeking air. <words>415</words>
Methodically random, I lock half the doors, open the others, scatter lavender, and stack tools into constellations a traveler could read. <words>436</words>
When the first salvager enters, dripping sand and riddles, I offer tea and the terminal, and together we cradle the unknown. <words>457</words>
Not to solve it, but to keep it warm, because the station runs best when mystery is fed and never finished. <words>478</words>
