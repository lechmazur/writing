<story>I stretch among hydrogen-lit orchards, a trickster lawyer on the run tracing breath into long, disciplined threads.<words>17</words>
This futuristic farm inside a biodome hums like a chest cavity, irrigated by drones and stubborn hope.<words>34</words>
I keep moving even during stretching, calves quivering, because stillness invites warrants to catch up.<words>49</words>
My purpose is to catalogue disappearing languages before their last syllables evaporate into the temperature-controlled haze.<words>65</words>
I learned patience as a performance, impatiently patient, squeezing years into minutes when the law demanded obedience.<words>82</words>
Now I answer only to the dares that divert me toward buried tongues and away from the courts.<words>100</words>
They arrive via cryptic dares from old high school rivals, people who once mocked my debate tricks and now regret it.<words>121</words>
Their messages fold like paper cranes, precise coordinates and linguistic scavenger lists, baiting me into chosen paths.<words>138</words>
Today, the clue is tied to a leftover gift tag fluttering from a vine of translucent wheat.<words>155</words>
On one side, someone scrawled an extinct greeting; on the other, a dare to harvest sounds before sunrise.<words>173</words>
So I stretch, counting breaths, letting ghostly resolve cool my nerves as the biodome windows silver with dawn.<words>191</words>
I record the rustle grammar of barley leaves, the vowel drift of recycled wind, the consonants bees abandon.<words>209</words>
Every crop here was engineered to host a diaspora of phonemes, archived in chlorophyll, trembling at the edge of silence.<words>229</words>
The tribunal thinks I fled with evidence, but I fled with a conscience polished by loopholes until it became a mirror.<words>250</words>
When the drones swing by, I divert them with decoy subpoenas printed on biodegradable starch, stamped with my own signature.<words>270</words>
The paper smells like old locker rooms and pep rallies, and for a moment the rivals are teenagers again.<words>289</words>
We all chose paths then, but mine twisted into a career that argued truth until truth demanded a different client.<words>309</words>
I text them a recording: syllables culled from wheat, gift tag rustle, and the half-laugh I cannot surrender.<words>327</words>
In return, a new dare arrives, mapping a path under aquifer pipes to a henhouse where dialects roost like stars.<words>347</words>
I hobble there mid-stretch, calves burning, and find a chorus of children teaching the chickens a language thought extinct.<words>366</words>
They trade me access for legal advice, and I warn them which contracts sprout shackles even when printed with flowers.<words>386</words>
Their teacher arrives, an old rival, who reminds me our bets were never money but whether a voice could outlive a sentence.<words>408</words>
I nod, impatiently patient, and we ink the phonemes onto seed packets, giving destiny a catalog number and a mouth.<words>428</words>
When alarms throb, the children scatter, the hens hush, and I tuck the leftover gift tag into my boot.<words>447</words>
Chosen paths do not disappear; they wait under mirrors, and I jog into the tunnels, carrying names that refuse to die.<words>468</words></story>
