After the last roadside vendor packs up at dusk, I slip into the harmonic resonance chamber. <words>16</words>
I am a hesitant saboteur, sworn to break what keeps breaking us. <words>28</words>
The chamber hums with savage serenity, as if the air smooths the blade it hides. <words>43</words>
I carry a compass that always points to home, heavy as a verdict in my pocket. <words>59</words>
I came here to piece together a mosaic from shattered hopes, not to scatter new shards. <words>75</words>
My contact taught me to judge intent via the rhythm of footsteps on cobblestones. <words>89</words>
In this place the floor is stone, and the city above tolls through it like a bell. <words>106</words>
The subtle signs rise from below, syllables of heel and sole spelling who is brave or cruel. <words>123</words>
Tonight the pattern says a watcher approaches, careful, alone, and functionally rare. <words>135</words>
Rare, because no one listens properly anymore. <words>142</words>
The device I must wound sits at the chamber heart, a lattice translating resonance into power. <words>158</words>
Break it, and the occupying signal will scatter; spare it, and the signal will cradle every thought. <words>175</words>
My hands hover, saboteur hands that tremble like reeds before a tide. <words>187</words>
The compass needle presses my thigh, an arrow unashamed of loving one direction. <words>200</words>
Home is where I learned to hear people walk before I heard them speak. <words>214</words>
Home is where my mother taught me that mercy begins in attention. <words>226</words>
The watcher enters, the doorway breathing around her, and she says my name without accusation. <words>241</words>
I ask whether the lattice hurts more than it heals, seeking permission I cannot name. <words>256</words>
She does not answer; she stamps three times, then drags heel to toe, a private sentence. <words>272</words>
I judge the meaning upon the stones, a measured plea that asks for tempered ruin. <words>287</words>
So I tune the lattice instead of shattering it, detuning the peaks that cut and leaving the rest. <words>305</words>
The chamber listens, then softens, turning the city murmur into a shelter for fragile thoughts. <words>320</words>
My mission collapses but my purpose holds, because sabotage can be a careful hinge. <words>334</words>
I leave a note where the vendors will sweep, a sketch of the mosaic unfinished yet truer. <words>351</words>
If they follow the subtle signs, they will find a power that keeps its palms open. <words>367</words>
I pocket the compass that always points to home and decide to walk without looking back. <words>383</words>
Behind me the watcher walks a rhythm like rain, and the chamber keeps time. <words>397</words>
Outside, dusk has hardened into night, yet the stones echo softer than before. <words>410</words>
The compass warms, and I think it finally judges me worthy of the way it chooses. <words>426</words>
Home, for now, is the quiet between hammer and anvil, where a saboteur can listen. <words>441</words>
