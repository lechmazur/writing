I arrived at the forgotten library inside a cave with a spine of borrowed bones. <words>15</words>
As a heartbroken reaper, I feared even my steps might harvest tender echoes. <words>28</words>
Yet the air was softly thunderous, like stormlight trapped in paper, urging me onward. <words>42</words>
I had ventured here to map hidden springs, to chart relief for the living and the lost. <words>59</words>
The dead I guide thirst for goodbyes, and the living thirst for beginnings, both seeking water. <words>75</words>
I followed a trail I had learned via the scattered seeds dropped by a migrating bird. <words>91</words>
Each seed wore a fleck of salt, as if the sky itself had cried maps. <words>106</words>
The cave library breathed around me, stacks leaning like elders, dust reading me back. <words>120</words>
On a lectern slept the first draft of a world-famous novel, curling at the corners. <words>135</words>
I had reaped its author decades ago, and they begged me to let their sentences evolve without them. <words>153</words>
Since then, I have carried their voice like a lantern, bright and bruising. <words>166</words>
Today, at the quiet intersection of heartbreak and healing, the pages whispered different endings. <words>180</words>
They pleaded for a map that honored changing rivers, evolving relationships between thirst and memory. <words>195</words>
I answered by pressing my ear to the damp stone, listening for softly thunderous pulses. <words>210</words>
The seeds arranged themselves on the floor, constellating routes to springs the town had forgotten. <words>225</words>
I traced the pattern with the scythe I rarely swing, cutting only curtains of mildew. <words>240</words>
The map was a venture into mercy, a cartography of where grief meets drinkable light. <words>255</words>
As I copied it into the margin of the first draft, the novel breathed like a tidepool. <words>272</words>
I realized the book had become world-famous because readers felt the springs even when unnamed. <words>287</words>
They sensed a fearful joy inside its chapters, a trembling hope that still stepped forward. <words>302</words>
I envied them, those who could drink and speak, yet I kept harvesting farewells like rain. <words>318</words>
The author had loved a river woman, and I had taken her during a winter of thin ice. <words>336</words>
He asked me then to leave room in the story for water to return to mouths. <words>352</words>
So I carried his first lines into the cave, letting the library adopt him as kin. <words>368</words>
Now, the seeds of the migrating bird ticked like clocks, and the springs answered with hush. <words>384</words>
The hush was not silence, but a softly thunderous vow that bodies could learn new tides. <words>400</words>
I folded the map into my robe and promised to guide the thirsty there soon. <words>415</words>
In return, the book asked me to keep reading, to let love revise my duty. <words>430</words>
I stepped from the cave with fearful joy, my scythe sheathed, my hands cupped for water. <words>446</words>
Behind me, pages turned themselves, and ahead, a town waited to evolve with the springs. <words>461</words>
