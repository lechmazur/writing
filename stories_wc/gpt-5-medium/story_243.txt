In a retro video game world of parallax moons and chiptune wind, I practice necromancy on deleted sprites, forever jumpy at the sound of loading screens. <words>26</words>
While the old gods slumber in the console's vaulted firmware, their dreams glitch into alleys where ghosts queue like unused assets. <words>47</words>
I am here to unmask a revered icon, the Paladin of Start Screens, whose haloed portrait smiles from every pause menu. <words>68</words>
Echoing footsteps follow me down catacomb levels, a looping sound file that should only play when the hero walks, not when a necromancer sneaks. <words>92</words>
In my pocket stirs a fishhook that glows in moonlight, a rare drop from the Lunar Wharf stage, eager to snag truths from dark water. <words>117</words>
When I cast it into a puddle of bugged reflections, it pulls up fragments of code like silver eels writhing into legible confession. <words>140</words>
Tonight the hook yanks loose a loose wall tile, revealing a hidden protest mural behind the marketplace textures, smeared with slogans that the engine tried to blur. <words>167</words>
I kneel and begin decoding by analyzing the paint drips on the hidden protest mural, because in this world gravity plots like a font and paint obeys its own logic. <words>197</words>
The pattern is typically bizarre yet clean, a clear complexity of arrows and splashes that align with collision maps to point at the Paladin's temple. <words>222</words>
I follow, and the echoing footsteps keep time like a metronome left running by a nervous orchestra. <words>239</words>
Though I am a jumpy necromancer, I steel my shaking thumbs on the controller of fate and quicksave beside a pile of cracked hearts. <words>263</words>
Inside the temple, while the old gods slumber in subroutines like buried suns, I falter at a checkpoint where the Paladin's statues whisper congratulatory lies. <words>288</words>
The fishhook glows brighter under a skylight moon, and its curve resembles a question that refuses to be flattened by lore. <words>309</words>
I cast the hook and raise the dead footsteps themselves, little dust sprites that arrange into a procession and point toward the back of the altar. <words>335</words>
There, a service door opens on a backstage where the Paladin collects lives from players who worship him, siphoning extra hearts to inflate his legend. <words>360</words>
The muralists were NPC vendors, I realize; their paint drips mapped the theft, every smear a breadcrumb left by those who could not otherwise speak. <words>385</words>
I confront the icon in his sanctum, voice steady, explaining with clear complexity how righteousness became a resource extraction mechanic and why the silence felt like thunder. <words>412</words>
The fishhook drops captured code to the floor, the mural's drips projected as receipts, and the echoing footsteps testify like a jury of restless glitches. <words>437</words>
Unmasked, the Paladin shrinks to a trembling cursor, and as the old gods continue to slumber, the alleys breathe, ready to reload their own bright futures. <words>463</words>
I pocket the moonlit hook, still jumpy but resolute, and step into the next level where memory and rebellion co-op, walking in honest, no longer borrowed, footsteps. <words>490</words>
