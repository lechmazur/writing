At the quantum beach, the air tasted like rusted lightning during the hush before the condemned building finally surrendered. <words>19</words>
I, a solitary summoner, prowled the tide margins where foam split into probabilities and rejoined like guilty rumors. <words>37</words>
In my pocket rasped a map drawn on a leaf, veins sketched into corridors only I could feel unfolding. <words>56</words>
The condemned arcade behind the dunes waited, windowholes black and swallowing, as the crew set the charges and held their breath. <words>77</words>
My family celebrates New Year's by listening to the last minute of a doomed structure, toasting the silence that makes history blink. <words>99</words>
I came tonight to outshine my own reflection, which prowls the tidal wells as a hundred me's flickering in fractured glass. <words>120</words>
The spark of invention is capricious, but on this beach it behaves like a tideclock: pull, release, and possible worlds appear. <words>141</words>
Even the illusions feel oddly authentic, their shadows heavier than the bodies I once failed to hold. <words>158</words>
As a summoner I do not conjure; I invite, I curate, I offer cavities where absence may root and grow teeth. <words>179</words>
The leaf-map crackled open, its capillaries aligning with the demolition wires, a green mirror to a red intention. <words>197</words>
I prowled from stake to stake, pressing the leaf against each junction, letting sap read the countdown pulsing through copper. <words>217</words>
My reflection stalked beside me in the brackwater panes, learning my gait, eager to be the first to step into the blastborn dawn. <words>240</words>
I would not let it; I would cast a brighter failure, a self who invents a path no mirror can counterfeit. <words>261</words>
Tonight, our holiday rite would crown this hush: we hum the building's frequency until it sings back, then drink the echo's dust. <words>283</words>
When the song found its pitch, I traced the leaf's edge in the sand, a door sized for a person who never quite existed. <words>307</words>
The beach shivered, probabilities sloshing like buckets, and through the door came a glimmering workshop carried in the ribcage of a wave. <words>329</words>
Inside, blue tools rusted into gold by imaginary salt waited, oddly authentic, promising corroded rapture for any brave enough to design with them. <words>352</words>
I married the leaf to a filament scavenged from the rigging, breathed a name into it, and raised a lens that burned rainwater into memory. <words>377</words>
My reflection stepped forward, slick with triumph, but the lens showed it every mistake I had not yet made, and it flinched. <words>399</words>
The charges whispered, the building knelt, and our glasses chimed as my reflection dissolved, outshone, while I prowled into a newly invented silence. <words>422</words>
