I am an underground poet crocheting a blanket in the witch's familiar menagerie, my hands detached, my pulse a disinterested passion. <words>21</words>
I crochet to surprise fate with an unplanned encore, the pattern improvising itself like a refusal to end the set. <words>41</words>
Around me, jars hum with captive winds, cats study equations, and a brimming cup of moonmilk trembles on the shelf. <words>61</words>
Beside the yarn sits an antique map with a tear that interrupts a river like a wound refusing its geography. <words>81</words>
The witch says each coordinate upon it is statically unique, fixed by spells that forbid replacement, as if identity were soldered. <words>102</words>
I learned to read such stubborn cartography through volunteer stints in odd places: morgues, tidepool clinics, dust archives beneath abandoned rails. <words>123</words>
Everywhere I went, I kept my face neutral and my notebook open, letting evidence speak while desire stayed muzzled and precise. <words>144</words>
Here the familiars choose me as their furniture, and the blanket grows, square by square, like an annex to silence. <words>164</words>
The brimming cup insists that fullness is a balance problem; one tremor too loud, and everything becomes overflow and confession. <words>184</words>
The tear on the map marks a place the witch refuses to visit, which makes me want to seize its coordinates like a dare. <words>208</words>
Before the tunnels flooded with police, I gave readings under bridges, my lines whispered to dripping concrete and sleeping pigeons. <words>228</words>
The night they chased us out, I promised myself to surprise fate with an unplanned encore, somewhere it was certain I would not go. <words>252</words>
So tonight, during blanket crocheting, I decode the torn river by counting stitches, letting yarn make proof where ink is broken. <words>273</words>
Through volunteer stints in odd places, I learned to barter with strays and ghosts; the familiars accept my measured voice as a passport. <words>296</words>
The witch clicks her needles, crocheting wards into the border of my blanket, not looking up, as if prophecy were housekeeping. <words>317</words>
When the brimming cup rattles without spilling, I take it as consent, the precise edge of permission I require to move. <words>338</words>
I seize the antique map with a tear, wrap it in the growing blanket, and follow a fox that smells like violets. <words>360</words>
It leads me to a door disguised as a mural of bees, where the air is warm with unreadable chords and tallow. <words>382</words>
Inside, the torn river realigns as steam on stone, and I perform the unplanned encore, reciting to water that remembers syllables. <words>403</words>
I leave with disinterested passion intact, yet altered: a statically unique route now threads my blanket, and the brimming cup finally overflows into fate's surprised hands. <words>429</words>
