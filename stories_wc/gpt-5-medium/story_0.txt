By policy the lights dimmed, yet a stained glass lamp on my desk threw small oceans across the ceiling, as if tides studied me back.<words>71</words>
I watched those shimmering maps and let evolving hopes drift into shapes my training could parse, the way sailors learn jokes from stars.<words>94</words>
Secretly, I was here to charm a monster from the depths, because the city budget demanded a public romance with our nightmares.<words>116</words>

Management wanted me to unite departments by producing friendly data, yet they also wanted the beast soothed, preferably by me, politely.<words>158</words>
Earnest mockery became my uniform; I bowed to memos, saluted spreadsheets, and tested each corridor like a stand up stage for honesty.<words>180</words>
During naptime the analysts snored, synchronized with cooling fans, and I slipped downstairs carrying the lamp, letting blue panes lead me like friendly fish.<words>204</words>
In the subbasement cistern I called softly, not with weapons or equations, but through forgotten promises I had overheard adults make and break.<words>227</words>
I promised to keep marbles click clacking in the dark, to remember nicknames, to let the fearful hide without shame while lights changed color.<words>251</words>
Water buckled; a breath like a library door opened, and the monster rose, eyes mosaicked, reflecting the lamp as if it were ancestry.<words>274</words>

I answered with audit humor, earnest mockery aimed at my own agencies, confessing that I was a sheepish spy who could not even lie properly.<words>323</words>
