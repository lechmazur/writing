After the last resource war, I walked the ethereal plains with dirt under my nails and a pocketful of raw solace. <words>21</words>
They called me a farmer, but I was an apocalyptic breeder of stubborn seeds that refused extinction. <words>38</words>
Each dawn I listened for the song of boundaries humming along the soil, mapping where life still consented to rise. <words>58</words>
The plains were quiet but typically atypical, colors soft as smoke, rules bent like wheat after a hard wind. <words>77</words>
I had once followed a commander who dictated my rations, my footsteps, even my thoughts, and I wanted out. <words>96</words>
So I sowed, mixed, and waited, breeding seeds that learned to drink fog and taste salt from the wind. <words>115</words>
At night I shuffled a magician's deck of trick cards, not for spectacle but for choices I could finally own. <words>135</words>
Hearts meant plant deeper, spades meant move camp, diamonds meant trade, clubs meant burn the blight before it spoke. <words>154</words>
When the wind picked up, the dead radio towers began to jabber, chittering ghost orders I refused to hear. <words>173</words>
Instead I listened for glass knocking against stones, a hush that meant the sea had sent me another message. <words>192</words>
News traveled to the interior through the messages in a bottle carried by the sea that wandered our clouded flats. <words>212</words>
The bottles washed up like sleepy fish, and inside, paper fluttered with coordinates, warnings, and fragments of remembered recipes. <words>231</words>
A woman named Mira wrote most often, her script angled like gull wings, promising coasts where fences were made of singing reeds. <words>253</words>
She said the song of boundaries there did not divide but tuned, teaching hands to touch without taking, teaching roots to share. <words>275</words>
I answered in the only way our broken map allowed, sending back seeds sealed in wax and hope sealed in salt. <words>296</words>
My farm, if you could call it that, was a compass listening post for tides that forgot themselves. <words>314</words>
I learned to read the ache in my knuckles as barometers, and to measure time by how long grief took to sprout. <words>336</words>
When raiders came, they jabbered about old flags and ration ledgers, but my cards flipped clubs, and the blight took their tracks. <words>358</words>
I kept Mira's letters rolled inside my sleeve, a soft cylinder of future that lifted my wrist when the world pressed down. <words>380</words>
Months later a bottle arrived with a final map and a single reed, which sang when I set it near water. <words>401</words>
I packed my deck, my seeds, and my guilt, and I walked toward the edge where plains blur into a remembered shore. <words>423</words>
The song of boundaries met me there, not as a wall but as a guide rail, saying this far is safety, and farther is trust. <words>448</words>
I crossed anyway, because I wanted to escape a life dictated by another, even if the next voice would be the sea's. <words>470</words>
The reed kept singing, typically atypical, and the bottles bobbed like punctuation behind me, period, comma, ellipsis, then open parenthesis. <words>490</words>
I stepped in, letting belonging tune me to living. <words>499</words>
