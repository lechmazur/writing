I am a lapsed priest under a sky of dull radiance.<words>11</words>
Around me towers a labyrinth orchard of giant bean stalks reaching the clouds.<words>24</words>
The air breathes like velvet, yet every path rustles with the hush of fate unraveling.<words>39</words>
I admit I am unapologetically confused, but confusion here is less a flaw than a compass.<words>55</words>
I jog between the green pylons, boots whispering on frost that pretends to be soil.<words>70</words>
My breath knots into counting and releases as prayer that does not ask permission.<words>84</words>
In my pocket rattles an abacus with missing beads, a broken rosary of arithmetic.<words>98</words>
I click what remains and tally the price of complacency, a debt accrued in sermons never spoken to myself.<words>117</words>
When I served, I mistook doctrine for direction, and my parish wandered by my stillness.<words>132</words>
Now the orchard bends into corridors like stern elders, demanding I move or be swallowed.<words>147</words>
I navigate by following snow patterns, tiny hieroglyphs of melt that point away from sameness.<words>162</words>
Each curve of white suggests a turning I would have avoided when I believed fate had a plan for me.<words>182</words>
But the hush grows louder the deeper I go, as though silence wants to be heard confessing itself.<words>200</words>
I count steps on the abacus, even the missing clicks, translating absence into a stern arithmetic of change.<words>218</words>
The stalks sweat winter, and from their seams fall pale filaments that make constellations at my ankles.<words>235</words>
I realize the orchard is a ledger and I am the unbalanced column, shivering toward a solvable error.<words>253</words>
So I promise the air, and the bean towers, and the God I fled, that I will not stand still again.<words>274</words>
I will jog until the frost forgets my name and remembers a better one I must earn.<words>291</words>
Through the hush of fate unraveling, the pathways release their grip, and the snow scrolls unfurl new alphabets.<words>309</words>
The abacus clicks once, though I know a bead is gone, and I accept the sum because it includes loss.<words>329</words>
My legs ache, and my doubt aches louder, yet the orchard begins measuring me by distance, not doctrine.<words>347</words>
I chase a spiral of footprints that are my own returning, and choose the branch that does not match them.<words>367</words>
Somewhere above, the bean stalks comb the clouds like librarians convincing thunder to stay quiet.<words>382</words>
Down here, I learn to read the weather as scripture written sideways, a gospel of movement and mercy.<words>400</words>
When the exit appears like a doorless dawn, I do not bless it; I pass through it to step beyond fate's design.<words>422</words>
Behind me, the orchard counts by my absence, and for once the tally and I agree.<words>438</words>
