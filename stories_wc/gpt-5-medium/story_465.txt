The antique airship drifted above the city like a memory refusing to let go. <words>14</words>
On its creaking deck, a mellow bard stood elegantly disheveled, hair a halo of storms tamed by smiles. <words>32</words>
He had taken passage to resuscitate wonder in jaded eyes, starting with his own, dulled by years of polite applause. <words>52</words>
Below, during the hush of an empty playground at twilight, swings ticked like metronomes for ghosts. <words>68</words>
He unpacked a traditional holiday meal his grandmother taught him, hoping the aromas would summon listeners more attentive than crowds. <words>88</words>
Unexpected guests answered: wind-battered orphans of the sky, a family of stowaway swifts, and one cracked bell rescued from a chapel. <words>109</words>
From his case he drew a worn wooden ruler, part baton, part bread-knife, and marked out measures of welcome. <words>128</words>
Learned patience had taught him that hospitality keeps rhythm, slow as dough rising, gentle as lanterns learning to glow. <words>147</words>
Yet tonight, joy wore the mask of terror, because the compass spun and the gasbag thrummed with delicious, dangerous possibilities. <words>167</words>
The galley stove flared, threatening overload, as if the spices remembered lightning and tried to teach the airship new thunder. <words>187</words>
Drawn by cinnamon, children slipped through the railings of the dusk below, climbing ladders of vapor only wonder could reveal. <words>207</words>
Their eyes were jaded by classrooms that measured miracles against grades, but their noses knew festivals never lied. <words>225</words>
He tapped the ruler along the rail, a hush-stringed instrument, each rap a star hewn from the hull and shared. <words>245</words>
He ladled soup, broke bread, and sang the story of how patience once persuaded a storm to sit and listen. <words>265</words>
Elegantly disheveled, he wore gravy like embroidery and smudged soot like eyeliner, gentling fear with ridiculous composure. <words>282</words>
The antique airship became another playground, a higher one, each rope a swing, each porthole a merry-go-round of clouds and vertigo. <words>303</words>
When gauges quivered, promising overload, he measured breath with the wooden ruler, counting heartbeats until the stove learned to behave. <words>323</words>
He told them his motive plainly: to resuscitate wonder in jaded eyes, starting with theirs, then his, then the engines themselves. <words>344</words>
As the traditional meal dwindled, more guests arrived, not ghosts but memories, including his grandmother, who seasoned silence with approving laughter. <words>365</words>
They descended at last during the same twilight hush, trembling with joyful terror, carrying crumbs of song to seed the waiting swings. <words>387</words>
Alone again, the bard cleaned the galley with ceremonious care, elegantly disheveled dignity bowing to the slow apprentice of patience. <words>407</words>
He measured the horizon with his ruler, found it pleasantly uneven, and promised to keep singing until straight lines learned wonder. <words>428</words>
