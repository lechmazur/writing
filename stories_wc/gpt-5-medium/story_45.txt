At dusk the floating museum drifted above the reimagined Mesopotamian temple, its hull glowing with a dull radiance like low embers refusing sleep. <words>23</words>
I am its jungle curator, shepherd of vines in glass, cataloger of parrot thunder, and reluctant priest to forgotten corridors. <words>43</words>
Tonight the corridors mirrored river canyons, logically illogical, stairways switchbacking upward like roots seeking water in the sky. <words>61</words>
I walked carrying the transparent violin made of ice crystal, an exhibit that sweats cold poems and refuses ordinary breath. <words>81</words>
The board demanded I play it for donors tomorrow, to hush the roar of guilt rising from an accident we never fully explained. <words>104</words>
The accident was a storm that peeled the arboretum open and released fifty rare frogs into the salt sky, my miscalculation. <words>125</words>
To repopulate the collection, I promised a pilgrimage to lost springs mapped under the temple, where ziggurats drink from hidden aquifers. <words>146</words>
Then the dirigible's engine coughed into silence, and unforeseen circumstances drafted me into an unexpected road trip across cracked floodplains. <words>166</words>
A museum truck, once a gift shop on wheels, became my ark, scooping up scattered botanists and a mechanic who believed in meteors. <words>189</words>
We followed the temple's shadow that stretched like a sundial through the silent overture of tomorrow, where hour one arrives without applause. <words>211</words>
Along the road, reeds rattled with invisible lizards, and the mechanic told me guilt is a drum you hear best after the parade. <words>234</words>
I answered by touching the violin's neck and feeling the touch of wonder, the way ice remembers constellations that stared down glaciers. <words>256</words>
When I bowed it, the instrument sang in whispers that tasted of tin and mint, calling frogs by their long, green names. <words>278</words>
We parked before the reimagined temple, its arcades rebuilt with reed brick and mirrored water, a place both excavation and dream. <words>299</words>
Architects there had trained vines to carry electricity, and their logically illogical lattice hummed like bees inside a copper amphora. <words>319</words>
We descended into chill chambers whose walls were carved with flood stories, and I laid the violin upon an altar shaped like tide. <words>342</words>
With each note, water seeped from the carvings, a quiet seep that coalesced into basins, and the frogs answered from the cracks. <words>364</words>
They leapt into cupped hands of stone, into jars lined with sunlight, into my traveling terrariums, as if the museum had grown legs. <words>387</words>
I felt the roar of guilt fade like thunder walking away, replaced by a lighter ache that matched the instrument's weather. <words>408</words>
We drove back along the temple's causeway, tomorrow almost audible, and the museum's anchor lines descended like patient vines to reel us heavenward. <words>431</words>
In the hangar, I rehoused the frogs beside the ice violin, and their throats clicked in rhythms that cooled the air. <words>452</words>
If anyone asked, I would say we repopulate because we must, but truly I do it to teach my heartbeat another, smaller drum. <words>475</words>
Through the silent overture of tomorrow, the museum drifted again, and I tuned the dull radiance until wonder felt almost like reason. <words>497</words>
