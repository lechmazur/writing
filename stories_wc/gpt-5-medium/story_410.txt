The chime sounded at the moment an elevator arrives to an empty floor, and nobody stepped out except my stubborn hope. <words>21</words>
I am an astute hermit stationed below, recruiting echoes as coworkers because the living keep their distance like cautious goats. <words>41</words>
My workshop squats in a cavern cathedral alive with phosphorescent flora, its glow painting my tools with patient, underwater saints. <words>61</words>
The city above thirsts, pipes coughing dust where fountains once gossip, and I tinker to restore water systems with the zeal of a bored mollusk. <words>86</words>
My budget is a rumor, so my centerpiece tool is a blunt scissor, reliable as a butter knife that dreams of surgery. <words>108</words>
I nick tubing, shave algae, and discipline cables with it, pretending gentleness can negotiate with corrosion the way priests bargain with weather. <words>130</words>
When calculations fail, I try something strangely effective, a trick learned from starving days and bakery vents, when noses were compasses. <words>151</words>
I amplify signals via the scent of a fresh loaf of bread, letting heat plumes carry tracer molecules like invitations to a dinner nobody attends. <words>176</words>
The vents adore crumbs of hope, and the valves, being romantic at heart, open slightly to flirt with the aroma. <words>196</words>
My radio laughs like a tired gull while I map the drift of scent, triangulating leaks by the way hunger tugs my thoughts. <words>219</words>
Isolation sharpens odd blades, and that is the impact of isolation the pamphlets forgot, a mind honed so thin it bends light. <words>241</words>
I practice jokes at dripping stalactites, who drip back better punchlines, and I answer with applause that echoes into a weary standing ovation. <words>264</words>
Today the chime repeats, and in the elevator shaft the cables sing a metallic psalm, but the doors part to my favorite nobody. <words>287</words>
I bow to the emptiness like a concierge who misses his least demanding guest, and then I get back to plumbing miracles. <words>309</words>
The bread decoy cools, so I toast hope over a lantern, coaxing another round of scent to crawl the ducts. <words>329</words>
In the glow, the phosphorescent flora throb like patient monitors, reminding me the city is a body and I am its underpaid organ. <words>352</words>
The valves answer at last, coughing to life, and somewhere above someone mutters blessings into a faucet, crediting angels while I clip another gasket. <words>376</words>
I grin, despairing humor my only wage, and threaten promotion for the blunt scissor, whose sideways snips restore a little hymn of pressure. <words>399</words>
I log the fix, speaking to the echo registry, and it answers with applause that sounds like rain practicing to be rivers. <words>421</words>
If anyone asks how I saved them, I will amplify the tale with crumbs of truth and say the city followed its nose home. <words>445</words>
Until then, I will keep cutting water from stone, and the stone will keep laughing, because laughter, like water, finds every crack. <words>467</words>
