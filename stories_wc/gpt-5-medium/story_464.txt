At the edge of twilight, I wiped grease from my apron and sauntered into the reality calibration office like I owned it. <words>22</words>
I am the office cook, yes, but also its academically mischievous liaison to trouble, seasoning equations while stirring soup. <words>41</words>
They calibrate reality here with clipboards and solemn clicks, and I keep their morale heady, their starch loosened, their taste buds daring. <words>63</words>
Yet tonight I carried my faded polaroid camera, a relic that hums whenever someone lies, and the hallway lights winced. <words>83</words>
The lens collects reflections that paperwork forbids, and like any good cook, I steal flavors wherever they hide. <words>101</words>
Call me a keeper of secrets, though secrets here prefer to be plated, sauced, and flamed with a whisper of menace. <words>122</words>
The supervisors, crisp and pious, adjust realities to keep the city from hiccuping, which is the politest word for madness. <words>142</words>
I prefer impolite words that will fracture glassware and composure alike, I want to spark madness in a realm too tidy. <words>163</words>
Because tidy realms are like under salted stews, potentially nourishing yet unbearably smug, they require a reckless pinch. <words>181</words>
So I slid into Archive Bay Three, where the floor bulged with buried treasure chests nobody admitted existed, and I selected one. <words>203</words>
We calibrate reality, they say, by opening buried treasure chests labeled with seasons, recipes, and forgotten arguments between constellations. <words>222</words>
I cracked the latch with a spatula, drifting arrogance ballooning in my chest like yeast, and the room inhaled. <words>241</words>
Inside lay recipes written on starlight parchment, each annotated in my hand from semesters spent auditing the universe for electives. <words>261</words>
Academically mischievous, I had proposed substitution ciphers for gravity and extra credit for well plated paradoxes, and the chest remembered. <words>281</words>
When the camera clicked, the photo developed blank except for the word Simmer, which is how the firmament fillets patience. <words>301</words>
I waved the picture, and the hallway clocks began to bubble, seconds softening, as if time had been slow cooked in secrets. <words>323</words>
Supervisors rushed in with safety tongs and protocols, but my smile stayed knife bright, because dinner, like destiny, was almost ready. <words>344</words>
I tilted the pot of chimes simmering on my station and let one note spill, a silver vowel that fractured their consensus. <words>366</words>
Then I opened a second chest, this one full of weathered peppercorns, and I ground them until the air learned to sting. <words>388</words>
Madness rose not as chaos but as a flavorful steam, revealing each supervisor's hidden hunger while my camera drank the confessions and kept them salted. <words>413</words>
I was the sassy cook they underestimated, the keeper who curates secrets on a long shelf, plating them nightly to remind order it should sweat. <words>438</words>
At closing, I left a single polaroid on the console, a self portrait tasting of meteors, and wrote, Remember, tidiness is just under seasoned fear. <words>463</words>
By morning the office would recalibrate, but a hairline fracture would remain, humming in their bones like a recipe no one can stop quoting. <words>487</words>
