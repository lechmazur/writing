<story>The resounding hush had a body in that place. [9]
It breathed between shelves and pillars like a long held chord. [20]
I arrived at the ancient temple library lost in time bearing my only tool. [34]
A softcover dictionary with sun bleached edges lay against my heart under my coat. [48]
I am the end of history witness, or so the last era named me. [62]
I had come to unravel cosmic illusions, the ones that turned choices to fog. [76]
The library accepted my breath and returned none of its own. [87]
Its readers were dust and yet the index wind still moved the leaves. [100]
Across a universe's hiccup, the catalogs had been sealed so that meaning could settle. [114]
I stood at the threshold where dates frayed into symbols and symbols into breath. [128]
The floor mosaic mapped a spiral arbitration, etched with bargains no longer spoken aloud. [142]
In this temple, disputes between epochs were settled by walking the spiral and letting silence judge. [158]
Here the hush did not stifle; it revealed. [166]
I wrote a title for my task in the dictionary margin with a pencil nub. [181]
Unify the broken record, I wrote, or fall into its echo forever. [193]
The letters looked wanderingly exact, as if each one sought a different horizon and still held the line. [211]
I began journeying inward while walking out, for the temple had exits that led through the center. [228]
Every door opened to corridors curling back toward the start, but the air tasted further. [243]
The spiral arbitration expected witnesses to weigh illusions against their cost, breath against breath. [257]
By training and by accident, I was both judge and record. [268]
When the universe hiccupped, I remembered everything for a second and nothing for a year. [283]
In that dropped beat, nations ended, lovers forgot, and echoes took the seats of kings. [298]
I walked the spiral to bind what could be recalled without lying. [310]
My dictionary cracked softly when I opened it at Listen. [320]
The entry listed obsolete senses for obey, heed, attend, and to make room within. [334]
I circled the last, thinking the world had forgotten that meaning just when it needed it most. [351]
The hush agreed with a tremor that felt like a distant sea inhaling. [364]
At the center of the spiral lay a lectern cut from meteor stone and wrapped in leather straps. [382]
The straps were marked with dates from before dates, mere scratches of frightened dawn. [396]
I loosened them and placed the dictionary upon the stone. [406]
The book was small enough to humble the altar and brave enough to keep its page. [422]
Read, the straps seemed to sigh, or be read by what reads you. [435]
I raised my head and spoke the names of the illusions one by one. [449]
The illusion that time marched, the illusion that endings were cliffs, the illusion that memory obeyed borders. [466]
For each I placed a finger upon the dictionary and felt a corresponding warmth in the stone. [483]
The spiral arbitration did not issue verdicts in words; it braided the breath of the seeker with the hall. [502]
As I walked, steps wanderingly exact, answers emerged like fish surfacing without ripples. [515]
The song of the hush filled my chest until my voice had space to be quiet. [531]
I saw that my title was wrong and right. [540]
I was the end of history witness only because I remembered the start. [553]
My task was not to end or to judge, but to be a hinge. [567]
To unify the outbreath of what had been with the inbreath of what would be. [582]
The method was the same as the secret of the temple stairs, journeying inward while walking out. [599]
Each pace gave away my certainty and returned a clearer question. [610]
Each question opened a shelf that had been misfiled by fear. [621]
I found a scroll that contained a forecast for a civilization that never happened. [635]
I read its weather, the years of clear skies, the sudden storms, the shared warmth. [650]
They were not lost; they had been deferred, the way rain waits in the mountain until the valley learns the word listen again. [673]
I closed the scroll and placed it beneath the dictionary so the definitions could hold it in the world. [692]
Then I felt the hiccup's echo fade, and with it the dizziness of broken sequence. [707]
The hush remained, resounding through bones and stone alike, a guide more than a law. [722]
I took up the dictionary, now warm, and wrote beneath the margin note another line. [737]
Be listening, it read, and be the room for the unkept promises to arrive and stay. [753]
I left the lectern and the straps coiled back with a satisfied whisper. [766]
The library did not applaud; it steadied. [773]
Outside the doors that opened through the center, the world inhaled as if remembering how. [788]</story>
