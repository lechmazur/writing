<story>After the last forest burns, the rail glitters like a vein across the glowing dune in bloom. [17]
I am the dreamless freight guard who walks the length of it, neither sleeping nor entirely awake. [34]
The cars hold relics and guesses, but one car hums softly with a divergent archive that refuses to settle. [53]
It is occasionally everywhere, its spines of memory blinking in and out along the track, as if undecided. [71]
Beside its crate sits a chess clock frozen at midnight, two faces with dead eyelids, waiting to be woken. [90]
I keep that clock because someone must mark the turn between what was and what might be. [107]
The archive opens when the dunes sing, and these dunes sing when the wind finds their glassy throats. [125]
Tonight the sand blooms pale blue, a million points of cold fire basking the freight in a brittle lull. [144]
I hum back a fractured lullaby, the only cradle song left to my mouth after the alarms went mute. [163]
The tune is a charm I learned from a dead signalman, who claimed the archive heard better through wave functions. [183]
So I let the notes scatter like pebbles in water, watching ripples fold where nothing seems to move. [201]
The crate answers with faint drafts, cold breaths of not yet, brushing my knuckles as if testing their steadiness. [220]
I tell it my motive plain, because nothing in this age respects riddles: I am here to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners. [244]
The archive quivers, performance given reason, like a shy animal whose name you finally pronounce without fear. [261]
I flip the chess clock toward it, and the hands, still speared at twelve, reflect the dunes like two blind fish. [282]
Midnight has no edges, I tell the car, but we can still learn to move inside its heart. [300]
At that, the glass flowers outside tilt their throats, and the wind answers with a patient enormous shiver. [318]
The archive finds a rhythm in my humming, a lattice of probability where it can choose to become less torn. [338]
It spills images across the planks, not pictures, but tendencies: seeds learning to be embers, embers rehearsing to be rivers. [358]
I set the first freight brake, and the train settles into its ribs, a creature trusting the hand that scratches. [378]
Then I whisper to the clock, and the frozen faces hear the charm moving through wave functions like a tide climbing stairs. [400]
Somewhere a latch retreats, and the archive stops being occasionally everywhere, folding itself inside the car like rain becoming a cup. [421]
It wants a game, I realize, a match against erasure, my breathing as one player, the clock as the other. [441]
On my turn I move only air, and the boardless rules accept the gesture, because promises count in ruins. [460]
The archive replies by offering a corridor of nights contained in a bottle, each night a place to plant a word. [481]
I choose the shortest, the one where wind hushes quick, because sparks need quiet to learn their names. [499]
I open that bottle and breathe into it, and it warms like a throat meeting tea after winter. [517]
Inside the car the not yet turns to almost, and tiny things begin to glow under burlap like patient stars. [537]
I know better than to look too soon, or the wave breaks, and the archive sulks back into arithmetic. [556]
Instead I pace the gravel, reciting the names of lost stations, so the miles remember how to hold arrival. [575]
When I return, the clock has sweat a single tick, wet as a tear, and the hands tremble past midnight. [595]
The crate stands open like a listening mouth, and inside are lantern spores, as soft as lungs, as stern as verdicts. [616]
I carry them to the unlit corners of the cars, to the couplers, to the axles, to the oldest bolts. [636]
Where rust once ate, small radiances settle and sip, and the train learns to be a greenhouse moving north. [655]
I step down into the sand, and the glowing dune in bloom returns the favor, planting quiet inside my boots. [675]
The spores on the rails wink, then travel, because motion is also soil, and their light is obedient but stubborn. [695]
By morning the archive sleeps, the clock breathes on its own, and the dunes forget our hymns but keep their color. [716]
I take my place at the coupler, a placeholder for restored woods, and let the track sing the next verse. [736]
Dreams do not visit me, but I am busy, and sometimes I am occasionally everywhere, exactly where sparks are needed. [756]
I turn my face to the wind and hum another charm, even if no newborns cry to be lulled. [775]
The world listens like a patient with bandaged ears, and the train rolls on, carrying its stitched together morning. [794]</story>
