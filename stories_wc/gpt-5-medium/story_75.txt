<story>
In the nano-forest, a guarded minstrel waited in angry peace for the moment when a last vow is written in a hidden diary. <words>23</words>
Their motive was simple and impossibly hard: to learn extinct crafts by harvesting whispers, and a plain plastic bookmark served as their quiet tool. <words>47</words>
Though skeptically credulous, they sifted rumor the way luthiers test wood, tapping each story to hear a grain of truth. <words>67</words>
The hidden diary belonged to would-be conspirators who organized grassroots movements, and the bookmark helped them speak by decrypting wedding vows that never happened. <words>91</words>
Yet the last vow had not been written, and time tightened its strings as the minstrel plucked at the margins of coded text. <words>114</words>
In the nano-forest, microtrees hummed, and pollen-like drones reflected the minstrel's guarded face in a thousand trembling, indifferent mirrors. <words>133</words>
The vow began to write itself, capillaries of ink threading symbols only the bookmark could reveal, a cipher blossoming into knot-tying patterns from extinct craft. <words>158</words>
Reading the knots, the minstrel learned how to bend sapwood into singing ribs, holding angry peace like a tuning fork against their heart. <words>181</words>
But the vows also warned of a betrayal, a plan to wed the minstrel to a cause without consent, and they resolved to disown it. <words>206</words>
They saw how the conspirators imagined artistry as property, while true grassroots movements must be luthiered by many hands, resonant and unpossessed. <words>228</words>
By decrypting wedding vows that never happened, the minstrel decoded the plan and composed a counterpoint performance that would let the forest speak. <words>251</words>
That plain plastic bookmark doubled as a reed, a slit cut with a thorn, sending a whistle message the nanobot trees could carry. <words>274</words>
When the last vow was written in the diary's capillaries, it said share every craft freely, and the minstrel answered with harsher love. <words>297</words>
They played, and the nano-forest reshaped itself into classrooms of bark and light, summoning neighbors who seeded new grassroots movements in the understory. <words>320</words>
Still guarded, the minstrel opened their traveling case, taught extinct crafts of stringing and resonance, and held angry peace like a lantern in rain. <words>344</words>
The conspirators arrived to claim ownership; the minstrel said, disown me or disown your fear, and the leaves clattered like tough applause. <words>366</words>
Because skeptically credulous, the minstrel trusted people to steward the craft yet verified every pledge, weaving committees like bracing into newly grown instruments. <words>389</words>
The diary closed, its wedding vows never happened yet reshaping fate, and the plain plastic bookmark rested among reeds as another last vow waited. <words>413</words>
Walking the tiny paths, the minstrel listened to grassroots circuits carry new songs, and felt angry peace settle after disowning the claim that art can be owned. <words>440</words>
They tuned their instruments to the hum of sap and code, promising to learn extinct crafts as living seeds, never property, always movement. <words>463</words>
