The undersea greenhouse hums above the coral plateau, a cathedral of glass pressed by fathoms, where dissonant calm gathers like silt in silence. <words>23</words>
Here I am the overburdened clerk, ledgering sunlight, oxygen, and the trembling inventory of seeds that could outrun a deadly disease. <words>44</words>
I count each sprout because every green whisper might become a cure, and I promised my sister I would not fail again. <words>66</words>
In my locker waits a vintage stamp collection rescued from a drowned post office, little kingdoms held in glue and perforation. <words>87</words>
Each stamp pictures a vanished shore, and when moistened by seawater they open seams in pressure, weaving between worlds as if letters still traveled. <words>111</words>
I learned this in the ephemeral pause of a breath, when panic thinned and the glass sang back my heartbeat like sonar. <words>133</words>
It began at a local trivia night in the canteen, where a stranger in a salt-stained blazer recognized the archive curled under my arm. <words>157</words>
He said truth here is absolutely relative, because pressure folds clocks, and he showed me how to lick a stamp like setting a metronome. <words>181</words>
Quantize your breathing, he whispered, sixteen counts in, sixteen counts out, and the ocean will reveal the integer steps between suffering and relief. <words>204</words>
I did as told, and the panes clouded with unfamiliar algae that wrote formulas resembling postage cancellations across the humid air. <words>225</words>
Through the seam appeared a library without doors, stacked with petri-etched corals, each swaying with pathogens named after cities that once whistled through envelopes. <words>249</words>
The stamps matched them, empire to virus, portrait to protein, as though every issue had been a vaccine rolled into paper time. <words>271</words>
I logged, watered, answered procurement pings, and timed my breaths, while my sister slept in a surface ward turning bluer than the shallows. <words>294</words>
One night I arranged the stamps by denomination, then by current speed, then by grief, and the seam obliged like a courteous cashier. <words>317</words>
I stepped through into brine-warmed moonlight where coral fronds spelled an amino sequence, a recipe scaled for lungs collapsing at sea level. <words>339</words>
The dissonant calm held as I copied it onto the back of a stamp and returned, each heartbeat tolling like ballast dropped in increments. <words>363</words>
I quantize the hours into parcels, rushing sequence and culture upstairs by pneumatic tube, while logging my shift as if nothing unusual transpired. <words>386</words>
In that pause of a breath between lab results, worlds wove and unwove, and my sister breathed, absolutely relative to me, yet triumphantly her own. <words>411</words>
