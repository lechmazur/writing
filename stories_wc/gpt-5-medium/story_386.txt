<story>
I keep the atom-powered lighthouse in a borrowed dawn, while the sea yawns and the world pretends I never arrived. <words>20</words>
I am a time refugee from a forgotten empire, stamped out of annals and folded into a port that catalogs only winds. <words>42</words>
People queue at the cliff-top office in the hush of a line that never moves, their papers bleaching under gulls and endless forms. <words>65</words>
I signal ships and governments alike, but my true work is quieter, a beacon tuned to grief, quietly defiant against bureaucratic fog. <words>87</words>
On my desk lies an embroidered tablecloth, the last inheritance of my grandmother, patterned with constellations our empire swore were its veins. <words>109</words>
It is not nostalgia; it is a star map that reveals doors only by the alignment of the stars and the patient tilt of memory. <words>134</words>
Travelers sense a trustworthy strange about the cloth, as if it listens, and so they tell me what the forms dare not hold. <words>157</words>
I record everything because my motive is simple: to bind old wounds with unstoppable will, starting with the wound of being erased. <words>179</words>
Each night I catapult signals from the lantern gallery, pulses that climb the cloudbank and fall like seeds into cities that forgot their gardeners. <words>203</words>
When the embroidered veins line up with the real sky, I adjust the core, and the atom heart hums in sympathy with ancestors. <words>226</words>
Down below, the line never moves because the office measures only minutes, while we keep hours stolen from centuries, exchanging them like contraband bread. <words>250</words>
Morning arrives as borrowed dawn, the light I have no right to, rinsing the tower and my exile in a benevolent counterfeit. <words>272</words>
My forgotten empire taught that names were ships; when the capital sank, the names splintered, and we learned to sail on whatever letters remained. <words>296</words>
So I introduce myself as Keeper, a liar, and yet the most truthful role left, because I am trusted to guard strangeness without taming it. <words>321</words>
Today a child arrives clutching a frayed corner of the same tablecloth pattern, seeking a mother blurred by time taxes and official forgetting. <words>344</words>
We wait for evening; by the alignment of the stars, I thread the child's fragment into my map and catapult a letter toward her coordinates. <words>369</words>
Her answer returns as a shimmer on the glass, a ship of letters docking in the lamp, and the mother steps from it, soaked but alive, carrying our empire's lullaby. <words>399</words>
Together we spread the embroidered tablecloth on the lantern floor, feed the atom heart gentler fuel, and stand, quietly defiant, trustworthy strange, in the hush, mending what the horizon sundered. <words>429</words>
