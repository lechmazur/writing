I was an introverted dancer before the dust made the city move like a broken clock. <words>16</words>
Now I spend my days in the cipher decoder's office, alphabetized by hum, calibrated by sighs. <words>32</words>
Around me, astronomical charts curl at the edges like old hands remembering warmth. <words>45</words>
I consult them with affectionate detachment, as if the constellations were students who grew wiser by ignoring me. <words>63</words>
They map the only possible future, a quiet corridor through the sky, a route to escape a desolate wasteland. <words>82</words>
The office used to belong to someone who solved wars the way I solve dances, through forgotten echoes. <words>100</words>
Their reel-to-reel sits patient, spooling whispers that I count like steps, odd then even, pause, return. <words>116</words>
My body moves only when necessary, an illogically logical metronome that beats against panic without revealing preference. <words>133</words>
During habit forming, I knit code into rhythm, and rhythm into thread I can tug in the dark. <words>151</words>
Knit, unknit, purl, slip, each motion a letter, each letter a star walking home across paper night. <words>168</words>
I decode coordinates no radio remembers, foundations laid by a dead mentor who taught discipline by overwatering plants. <words>186</words>
He would say mental fortitude is the art of lasting longer than your confusion, and I practice until confusion blushes. <words>206</words>
My reflection in the darkened window keeps time, a partner who never interrupts, a kindness I treat like distance. <words>225</words>
The charts whisper that south is a rumor, but west is a sentence whose grammar improves with patience. <words>243</words>
I annotate margins with counted breaths, notes that look like footprints, reminders not to confuse urgency with exit. <words>261</words>
When the sirens test their lungs, I rehearse the sequence: door, stairs, alley, river, silence, sky, and a final bow. <words>281</words>
The bow is not for applause, but for the office, which lets me go by pretending it never held me. <words>301</words>
Some nights I talk to the recorder and ask it to misplace my fear among its catalog of losses. <words>320</words>
It answers with static like old snow, a soft cloth I wrap around the room until it looks swaddled. <words>339</words>
Then I dance tiny, thrifty phrases, translating longitude into ankles, latitude into wrists, farewell into a heel turned sideways. <words>358</words>
My plan remains simple because it is difficult: cross at dusk, follow Orion's forgotten belt, stitch water to thirst. <words>377</words>
I will leave a letter for the next exile, explaining the arithmetic of grace the charts kept folding into me. <words>397</words>
Take nothing, remember everything. <words>401</words>
When I finally go, I will leave the metronome ticking for the dust to dance alone. <words>417</words>
