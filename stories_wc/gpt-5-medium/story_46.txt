<story>The blank-faced performer arrived without footsteps.<words>6</words>
It was during piano practice in the orchard of giant ferns overshadowed by waterfalls.<words>20</words>
I, the appointed guardian of rumors, paused with my metronome ticking like a sensible heartbeat.<words>35</words>
The score demanded precise madness, a rigorously angled frenzy that refused to smear.<words>48</words>
On the keyboard lay a plain plastic ring the performer had set beside middle C.<words>63</words>
It glowed only because the waterfalls scattered noon into trembling coins.<words>74</words>
The stranger wore a uniquely typical suit, beige as unspoken consent.<words>85</words>
They asked if I would approve their entrance to the rumor orchard by tracking moon paths across the still puddles between roots.<words>107</words>
I answered with scales, C to C, a gate of equal hammers.<words>119</words>
The performer mirrored my hands without a face to show intention.<words>130</words>
Their posture was a ledger, all checked boxes and vanishing decimals.<words>141</words>
Rumors are animals that shed their names, I said, and they seek keepers who can whistle in dreams.<words>159</words>
I wanted to learn the language of dreams, not as translation but as breath.<words>173</words>
The ring, they explained, was a scoreless signature, a loop for holding sound when sound needed to sleep.<words>191</words>
If I wore it, they would follow my arpeggios into the understory where the ferns touched cloudfall.<words>208</words>
If I refused, they would become a rumor that I had never learned to hear.<words>223</words>
I tried the ring, so light it corrected my balance like an absent teacher.<words>237</words>
Moon paths etched themselves upon the puddles, thin silver staffs that moved when I shifted tempo.<words>253</words>
I approved their entrance with a chord built from all the unheard intervals between our breaths.<words>269</words>
The performer nodded with the whole body, a bow without a face, and began to strike keys in sequences that seemed incorrect until the waterfalls repeated them.<words>296</words>
I realized their blankness was not emptiness but the clean surface where rumors wrote their auditions.<words>312</words>
Each rumor arrived as a fingertip of mist, shaped by the velocity of falling water and the geometry of fern shadow.<words>333</words>
To test them, I played a lullaby backward while counting prime numbers outward from zero.<words>348</words>
Only the rumors that kept tempo without clinging to meaning earned my careful trust.<words>362</words>
Those I placed inside the ring, which somehow widened to hold entire whispers like a nest holds wind.<words>380</words>
The performer watched with uniquely typical patience, feet planted as if measuring the orchard for future echoes.<words>397</words>
When I faltered, they lifted one hand toward the waterfalls and the spray arranged itself into a staff, approving our shared lesson.<words>419</words>
In that staff, moon paths curved like sentences before they are spoken, coaxing the dreams to show their grammar.<words>438</words>
I listened until the waterfalls breathed in sync with the metronome, and then the orchard taught me to pronounce silence with vowels of dew.<words>462</words>
When practice ended, I removed the ring and tucked it near middle C, already hearing its sleep give off rumors that would wake as music tomorrow.<words>488</words></story>
