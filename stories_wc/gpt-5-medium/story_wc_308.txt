<story>I came to the canyon of endless echoes with weathered resolve and a kit of stones that could sing. [19]
The towers of bone rose like pale forests, brittle ribs leaning into a sky that forgot how to be blue. [39]
I am a harmonic stone skimmer, historically reverent, apprenticed to echoes older than my grandmother's myths. [55]
My craft is to drop the thinnest disc upon the shale pools and let it ricochet sound from bone to bone. [76]
Every bounce returns a measure, and every measure returns a map. [87]
But today my hands rest on my knees, because I have come to learn to navigate without moving. [105]
Stories said the canyon kept a pulse left wandering, a rhythm broken free from any living heart. [122]
They said if I could hear it, I could sit still as a cairn and still cross anything worth crossing. [142]
So I climbed through centuries of layered dust and found the oldest ledge, where wind had carved a bench for patience. [163]
Beside me lay a single stone arrowhead, flaked in the style of people who read shadows like scriptures. [181]
I appraise its edges with a fingertip and feel a burr of use, as if long ago it trimmed silence itself. [202]
I tie the arrowhead to my cord of skipping stones, turning it into a weight for breath. [219]
Below, a seep has gathered into a black mirror that knows more of sky than sky knows of itself. [238]
I breathe into the cord, and the stones answer with a small bright hum that wakes the ribs around me. [258]
From the far spine of the canyon, birds startle and braid into the day, their wings writing across the hollows. [278]
This is my method: through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight, I hear the grammar of the air. [299]
The canyon answers in counterpoint, returning their wingbeats as ripples of pressure, as if the bones were tuning forks. [318]
I do not move; I let the hum and the birds navigate me, placing my mind like a marker on their map. [340]
Somewhere inside the chorus, I hear the pulse left wandering, a low note that avoids being found by pretending to be stone. [362]
It stutters across the stratified echoes like a hidden spring changing channels, refusing any line that would cage it. [381]
The arrowhead trembles on the cord, wanting to fall, reminding me that every tool was first a prayer. [399]
I remember the hands that knapped it, perhaps standing on this ledge, historically reverent to the same unanswerable hollows. [418]
They, too, might have listened for a map that arrives as rhythm, a way of going while staying put. [437]
The birds shear toward the sun and then arc back in a dish of light, and the bones sing in four directions. [459]
I press my thumbs to the arrowhead and tune my breath to the birds, counting the beats that refuse me and the beats that allow. [484]
Soon I sense the pulse choose a path through me, as if I were a hollow bone added to the towers. [505]
I do not rise, but the canyon shifts; distances fold like paper boats, and far walls lean until they are within arm's speak. [528]
This is what it means to learn to navigate without moving, to appraise not where you are but how you are heard. [550]
I test the map by closing my eyes and picturing the canyon as a vessel, its channels lined with memories like resin. [572]
The wandering pulse settles toward the heart of that vessel, and the birds knot over it, feathers ticked with dust like soot. [594]
I cast the arrowhead into the mirror and listen to its fall, a single click that strikes the exact rib I need. [616]
The echo returns wearing the scent of lichen, a reminder that time is a spiral winding around bone more than through it. [638]
What I find is not a treasure but an address, a place inside the sound where I can meet those who waited. [660]
I see them not with eyes but with the steadiness of the pulse they left, ancestors and strangers sharing the same vow. [682]
Hold still, the canyon says, and the world will carry you. [693]
I hold still, and I travel as the birds travel, not by feet but by agreement, my consent aligned to the old note. [716]
When I open my eyes, the ledge is the same, yet the map inside me has redrawn the world to fit its singing. [739]
I leave the remaining stones on the bench for the next listener, and I keep the cord empty, a lesson coiled around nothing. [762]
The birds settle into the towers of bone as dusk flares, and the wandering pulse goes on, less alone for having been heard. [785]</story>
