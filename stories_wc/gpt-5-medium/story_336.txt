I am the weary undertaker who keeps time for the dead when clocks have forgotten them. <words>16</words>
Tonight, the city exhales and I step into a doorway, listening for that placid ferocity inside me. <words>33</words>
It all unfolds during the hush after a car backfires in a silent street. <words>47</words>
The blast startles memory, then time stills, and my breath matches the ancient gears inside my satchel. <words>64</words>
I carry a pocket astronomical clock lifted from an ancient Persian palace reimagined as a municipal morgue. <words>81</words>
Its jeweled face tracks planets and grief with the same indifferent regularity. <words>93</words>
I learned to wind it from tribal knowledge passed among gravediggers who speak softly under cedar shade. <words>110</words>
Their wisdom is rarely practical, yet it keeps hands steady when the moon forgets the schedule. <words>126</words>
Inside the morgue, marble slabs imitate deserts, and corridors borrow their arches from half remembered empires. <words>142</words>
Someone reimagined the palace with fluorescents and gurney rails, leaving the stars to glow on tile. <words>158</words>
Tonight, there is a body without a name and a note asking me to imprison its shadow. <words>175</words>
As if a shadow were a stray dog, and not the last map out of the abyss. <words>192</words>
But hope is a map too, and I was hired to hold onto hope in the absolute dark. <words>210</words>
So I set the clock on the slab and align its face to the rafters like stolen constellations. <words>228</words>
The palace remembers how to breathe when the astronomical hands move across blue enamel. <words>242</words>
By following sun paths etched on the dial, I find the shadow gathering near the faucet. <words>258</words>
It flinches like a moth, but it speaks like an uncle who never left the village. <words>274</words>
He tells me the name that the city shaved off his tongue, syllables tasting of pomegranate and dust. <words>292</words>
Tribal knowledge says names are cages and keys, and the trick is choosing which door to close. <words>309</words>
I mark the syllables with chalk on the tile, circles within circles, rings within rings. <words>324</words>
The clock hums like a hive, and a thread of darkness twists, tethered to the hours. <words>340</words>
I do not imprison him; I host him, as the palace hosts caravans of wind and memory. <words>357</words>
In return, he teaches me how grief walks the corridors by following sun paths only grief can see. <words>375</words>
We pace together, counting steps, until dawn remembers its route and slips along the tiles like mercy. <words>392</words>
Outside, the street remains silent, the gunpowder breath already a rumor within the stones. <words>406</words>
Inside, I wind the clock and hope holds me with a gentler, unbreakable ferocity. <words>420</words>
