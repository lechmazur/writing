<story>
I am a glamorous undertaker who catalogs memories in a social network archive, where echoes have usernames and grief has filters. <words>21</words>
By day I set eyelids like curtains, by night I mix paints in the conservation lab, shading the past while the pigment blooms. <words>44</words>
Tonight the palette turns jubilant remorse, a carnival of blues confessing their regrets to my steady brush. <words>61</words>
I am fruitlessly patient, yet radiant, because the dead keep arriving late to their own colors. <words>77</words>
My brass measuring tape sits beside the jars, a loveworn serpent engraved with the name of Great Aunt Sila. <words>96</words>
Sila taught a unique family tradition passed down from her shipboard wake, where storms applauded the embalmer who could paint time. <words>117</words>
She said, elongate the border of a life with hue, and you shall measure what cannot be quantified. <words>135</words>
So during paint mixing I draw the tape across the screen-lit faces, each pixel a breath I refuse to lose. <words>155</words>
The archive scrolls like surf, billions of posts beating against the pier of my attention, rehearsing the myth of ordinariness. <words>175</words>
Ordinary is a soothing lie, I tell the tags and timestamps, because every life here has sequins hidden beneath its ash. <words>196</words>
A courier arrives with a drive shaped like a heart, and with jubilant remorse I welcome another flood of farewells. <words>216</words>
I log the donors, I wash my hands, and I whisper to Sila that I am preserving ancient practices the only way left. <words>239</words>
Here, the embalming fluid is resin, and we fix the living colors to nonliving pages so their heat does not wander. <words>260</words>
Sometimes the monitor shows my reflection in sequined black, a glamorous undertaker dappled with ultramarine, smiling like a saint who erred. <words>281</words>
I measure a timeline with the tape, mark the inches where a father told a joke, where a pet learned dusk, where hope cracked. <words>305</words>
Then I stretch the color band to fit those inches, letting the blues elongate until they find the exact laugh they owe. <words>327</words>
It is a craft and a prayer, a tradition that refuses algorithmic sleep, my inheritance from the woman who painted storms closed. <words>349</words>
When the paints settle, I package the day into an album labeled Radiances, and I mourn the ordinary that never truly existed. <words>371</words>
But joy rises, an unruly clarion, when a color revives a face, and the archive breathes like a reawakened gallery. <words>391</words>
My hands tremble with remorse for what I cannot save, yet jubilant for what refuses to dim when measured kindly. <words>411</words>
I share a final post under Sila's name, promising the patient dead that our bright failures will keep their rituals breathing. <words>432</words>
Then I close the jars, pocket the brass measuring tape, and walk home luminous, respectfully haunted, ardently ordinary in nobody's myth. <words>453</words>
