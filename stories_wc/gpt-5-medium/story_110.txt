Between chapters, I keep a water clock repair shop where time limps in with leaky ankles and leaves wearing borrowed shoes. <words>21</words>
I am quietly flamboyant, which means my sleeves whisper peacock, yet my footsteps apologize for the dance. <words>38</words>
Customers think I mend minutes, but I am a hidden assassin who renders verdicts in drips and calibrated drownings. <words>57</words>
Their clocks arrive heavy with domestic mysteries: rattling pipes that gossip, floats that sulk, cisterns that dream of dry divorces. <words>77</words>
At dusk I lift a moss-covered lantern, not for light, but to borrow its patient green mood for my diagnostics. <words>97</words>
It is hard to look professional while consulting moss, but mildew has a work ethic poets only impersonate. <words>115</words>
I interview every clock through bleak eulogies that mention hidden truths, praising their noble leaks and shaming their cowardly silences. <words>135</words>
I adore the moment a valve blushes and confesses how it drowned a birthday candle, or a promise, or a wedding invitation. <words>157</words>
Each confession is a bruise pressed to paper; my notebooks ache, aspiring to transmute pain into a masterpiece of household tides. <words>178</words>
Tonight a woman arrives between thunderstorms, clutching a clock that ticks like shoes on marble, eyes rehearsed for bad news. <words>198</words>
She says the device belongs to her husband, who lives between chapters, forever on a lunch break from his own plot. <words>219</words>
He is my assignment, the kind that signs itself; a man who folds laundry so neatly the creases form alibis. <words>239</words>
Inside his water clock I find lint from a tuxedo, crumbs of anniversaries, and a hairpin that ticked itself into witness. <words>260</words>
My eulogy for the mechanism is brisk and bleak, mentioning hidden truths about punctual betrayals and the damp calculus of absences. <words>281</words>
The woman laughs the way chipped teacups laugh, which is to say bravely, while asking my rates for both repair and regret. <words>303</words>
I quote a number and set the moss-covered lantern in the window; if he returns tonight, the green will mean enter. <words>324</words>
This is my quietly flamboyant flourish, a semaphore nobody notices unless their heart is late for its own appointment. <words>343</words>
He arrives smelling of starch and thunder, and I serve tea while the clock weeps, describing how it timed his practiced vanishing acts. <words>366</words>
I adore civility, so I kill him gently, with a compliment and a wrench, then deliver his obituary to the dripping gears. <words>388</words>
Through bleak eulogies that mention hidden truths, I archive the household storm, transmuting their pain into a masterpiece, and call it Chapter Nowhere. <words>411</words>
