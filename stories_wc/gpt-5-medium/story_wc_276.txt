<story>The sound wave garden woke like a feral lullaby echoing from the ribs of the sea. [16]
I stood at its jetty, a cool-headed fisher with brine on my sleeves and patience in my mouth. [34]
The sea there was not water but braided music, ripples of bass and hush, hills of whisper and troughs of drum. [55]
It was the hour when patterns break themselves, and the garden unspooled its leaves into staves. [71]
I had come to fish for a voice, to catch the echo of a goddess who once sang this coast into shape. [93]
Her temple had fallen, and the tide carried the rubble as a chorus of lost tongues. [109]
Somewhere in that chorus, the goddess slept, and in her sleep she let the constellations walk. [125]
We call them sleepwalking constellations, because the stars step down when she dreams and rearrange the shore. [142]
Their footprints are tidepools shaped like ears, waiting for a listener. [153]
I did not bring a rod but a rail spike, cold iron scavenged from the abandoned line that once stitched the cliffs. [175]
In this garden, iron is a tuning fork if you know where to hold it. [190]
I gripped the spike between thumb and forefinger, and the scored metal transliterates emotions the way a dry river reads rain. [211]
It took my steadiness and returned it as a map of currents I could taste. [226]
Cool-headed is what they call me, but calm is a net you mend every hour. [241]
When I felt the goddess stir under the chorded surf, I unspooled my line of silence. [257]
I cast not with hooks but by voicing silence, letting the held breath carry over the bars and reeds. [276]
The garden answered in a tremor that moved like moonlight through skin. [288]
Waves of sound rose into hedges and aisles, and I walked their corridors as if in a cathedral of thunder. [308]
The constellations came down in a zigzag, swaying like lanternfish, their light brushing the leaves of tremblegrass. [325]
They were sleepwalkers indeed, unsure of their hands, but driven by a dream that pressed remorselessly forward. [342]
One stopped beside me and put a star to the rail spike, and the iron opened like a throat. [361]
Sound became brine, brine became wind, and the wind carried syllables that had no letters. [376]
The spike transliterates emotions because it remembers tracks, and tracks are what music would be if it had to carry weight. [397]
I read the pressure and the release, the catch and the let go, until meaning bulged like a net heavy with mackerel. [419]
Her echo slid into focus, a voice that was both cradle and claw. [432]
She asked who dared fish in her afterlife, and I said only a listener with salt for a tongue. [451]
I told her I was here not for trophies but for the map that her echo kept folded. [469]
The coast has been losing itself, I said, falling into the type of silence that does not sleep but devours. [489]
She answered that the patterns of the tides were originally her breath, and without a song they falter. [507]
By voicing silence I had aligned myself with the empty bar between notes, the place where a choice enters. [526]
She would give me the coastline again if I returned her name from the mouths of the sleepwalking constellations. [545]
But the stars spoke in wind and the wind spoke in waves, and I could only answer by walking. [564]
So I entered the aisles and let the hedges of sound close behind me, my path a slow zigzag toward the deepest refrain. [587]
The rail spike thrummed against my palm, and each pulse carved a syllable that my tongue could not shape but my bones could hold. [611]
I met three constellations seated like elders upon a dune of hush, and they examined the iron as judges might examine an oath. [634]
One transliterates emotions into routes across the sky, said the tallest, but will you walk them with your feet or with your listening. [657]
With both, I said, and planted the spike into the dune so the rail could remember the shore it once refused to touch. [680]
The garden shuddered; waves rose into antlers and broke into petals; the sky bowed and pressed its brow to the harbor rim. [702]
From the place where patterns break themselves came a hush that was not empty but vast with possibilities. [720]
I voiced that hush and the constellations turned their faces, and I heard the goddess not as thunder but as the promise before thunder. [744]
Her echo touched the spike, and the spike traced a coastline inside me, cove by cove, hazard by blessing. [763]
Give it back, she breathed, and I knew she meant not hoard but hold in a way that keeps opening. [783]
I lifted the spike and let the map spill back into the tide. [796]</story>
