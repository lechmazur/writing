<story>I slip into the ancient Roman marketplace wearing my most ordinary grin, the one that promises nothing and threatens everything. <words>20</words>
A determined outlaw, I browse the stalls as if I might buy figs rather than futures. <words>36</words>
The sellers huff like old lions, weighing coins and rumors, while I weigh the shimmer of possibility. <words>53</words>
Earnest mockery is my cloak; I praise their olives with liturgical awe, then sneer at the gods for pricing them so high. <words>75</words>
They laugh, and laughter oils the hinges of this day. <words>85</words>
In my simple cloth pouch clink three desultory coins, a chipped stylus, and a square swatch torn from a painter's rag. <words>106</words>
I am wistfully pragmatic, remembering the days when I believed power was a staircase instead of a trapdoor. <words>124</words>
Today I stand at the threshold of discovery, as ridiculous and sacred as a beggar fanning incense toward himself. <words>143</words>
The clue waits where art became cover and commerce became camouflage. <words>154</words>
I find a vendor hawking disused canvases, their paint smudges a tired map of dreams someone else could not afford to finish. <words>176</words>
By matching paint smudges left on disused canvases, I align scraps of color the way augurs align birds, pretending not to care if the omen bites. <words>202</words>
Here a smear of imperial purple, there a wink of oxidized verdigris, together suggesting a pattern etched into the marketplace flooring. <words>223</words>
The lines converge beneath a stall of lamps, which is either fate playing comedian or a cautious engineer's ghost selling his inventory twice. <words>246</words>
I kneel, ask the vendor about shadows, and with a sincerity that sounds like insult, offer to buy his worst lamp for my best compliment. <words>271</words>
He barks a price; I pay in irony first, then coins, and he laughs again because he thinks us both thieves of different hymns. <words>295</words>
Lamp in hand, I press the swatch to the stones, then twist until the purples meet the border mosaic and the verdigris kisses a tiny brass stud. <words>322</words>
Beneath the stall, something yields with a sigh like a slave given his hour back, and the flagstone exhales a colder breath. <words>344</words>
I lower the lamp into the seam and see not flame but a pale aurora, the marketplace stones storing night itself like a disciplined battery. <words>369</words>
The hidden power source hums, modest as a clerk, yet the hairs on my neck salute its command. <words>387</words>
I could sell this to senators, or to generals, or to the starving who would turn night into bread, but my heart, practical and longing, says keep it safe until the city forgets me. <words>421</words>
I seal the seam with a practiced shove, then teach the vendor my counterfeit hymn about honest lamps that burn without smoke. <words>443</words>
He swears I am a poet, which is his way of calling me a liar, and I answer like a priest, which is my way of promising to return. <words>472</words>
When night falls, I will come back with the pouch, more canvases, and a map scribbled in jokes sincere enough to ring true. <words>495</words>
