<story>The floating island spa drifts above a quilt of clouds like a pampered teapot, steeping the sky in eucalyptus. <words>19</words>
I arrive in the hush where hope takes root, a contrite swordsman pretending my guilt is just another towel. <words>38</words>
Everyone here moves with a hypnotically rigid grace, as if the island is held up by taut hamstrings. <words>56</words>
The receptionist bows so precisely that her smile clicks, and I try not to draw my cracked monocle just yet. <words>76</words>
It was my master who left me the monocle, split like a half truth, before vanishing with a wry apology. <words>96</words>
He said the rightful heir hid among steam and cucumbers, and that only kindness would loosen the knots steel could not. <words>117</words>
My mission is to unmask a pretender to the throne without slicing the towels or the customers. <words>134</words>
So I book the Royal Reckoning Facial and a journey through the tattoo sauna, which sounds like a joke with hot rocks. <words>156</words>
A therapist named Lilt guides me down halls smelling of mint and missed chances, her voice bobbing like a buoy. <words>176</words>
She notices the sword scar on my palm and places a warm stone there as if to park a small moon. <words>197</words>
Gentle heat climbs my arm, and with it a memory of a village I carved to save and nearly ruined. <words>217</words>
I confess without meaning to, and Lilt listens as if my remorse is a bird she might cup without smothering. <words>237</words>
Kindness does not absolve me, but something in its temperature unlocks a stubborn latch I had welded from pride. <words>256</words>
I slip on the cracked monocle, the spa air warping through it into threads and knots like a loom of secrets. <words>277</words>
In the tattoo sauna, patrons recline as artists paint steam that condenses into ink on their shoulders, then unspools like yarn. <words>298</words>
I pretend to nap while watching a serene guru whose posture is so hypnotically rigid it seems puppeteered by expectations. <words>318</words>
His back bears cryptic tattoos of waves crashing into crowns, and the lines twitch when the wind tugs the island. <words>338</words>
I recall my master muttering that the impostor will be revealed by unraveling cryptic tattoos, the way destiny hates a knot. <words>359</words>
So I spin a harmless yarn to Lilt about royal allergies, and she nods, whisking away cucumbers to fetch chamomile. <words>379</words>
Alone with the guru, I breathe, then speak to the part of him that must be tired of pretending to float. <words>400</words>
I tell him I will not draw steel, only the thread of truth that has snagged on his careful smile. <words>420</words>
His eyes gloss, the ink shivers, and through the monocle I see a tapestry loosening, crown unhooking from wave. <words>439</words>
He whispers that the real heir is a masseur exiled for mercy, and begs me to end the charade without blood. <words>460</words>
Lilt returns with tea and, with nothing more than warmth, thanks him for holding the kingdom together while it healed. <words>480</words>
The tattoos unravel into harmless swirls, the island exhales, and both of us are freed by kindness rather than conquest. <words>500</words>
