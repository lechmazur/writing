<story>I make games in hiding, drawing my boards inside a forgotten clock tower.<words>13</words>
The gears hardly move, but the air keeps time with my scraping pencils.<words>26</words>
During drawing, when lines threaten to turn rigid, I loosen them by telling myself stories.<words>41</words>
Tonight the story begins with a chance encounter at an improv show.<words>53</words>
I had gone there to shadowbox with personal demons and laugh at their costumes.<words>67</words>
Someone handed me a phantom carnival ticket, its paper cool yet oddly warm, metaphysically physical.<words>82</words>
They said it would admit me to prizes I did not know I wanted.<words>96</words>
The show improvised a doorway, and I slipped through with the ticket like permission.<words>110</words>
Back at the tower, the ticket now rests beside my compass, a small moon.<words>124</words>
Its glow makes the graphite shine as if the squares know they can move.<words>138</words>
I design escapes, but tonight escape seems to be designing me.<words>149</words>
Each card I draft asks where I learned to hide and whom I left outside.<words>164</words>
The answer is a childhood arcade, its prizes taped behind glass like distant planets.<words>178</words>
The ticket lies there as counterpoint, promising admission without the claw machine judgment.<words>191</words>
When the minute hand snags on rust, I hear applause from nowhere, gentle and expectant.<words>206</words>
I let the rules breathe, inviting chance to sit where certainty has slumped for years.<words>221</words>
The board becomes a map of the tower, rooms sketched like wounds that finally name themselves.<words>237</words>
Players will climb, confess, trade burdens, and tie ribbons on the minutes they save.<words>251</words>
The winning condition is simple, the gift of belonging, awarded when you open a door.<words>266</words>
Opening means admitting you do not know every rule and still wanting to play.<words>280</words>
I test the first turn against my habits, and the tower answers by breathing easier.<words>295</words>
Outside, the city forgets me kindly, its lights practicing indifference that does not hurt tonight.<words>310</words>
I place the phantom carnival ticket on Start, and it clicks like a key.<words>324</words>
A current lifts through the gears, not electricity, more a hush deciding to speak.<words>338</words>
Pieces gathered from thrift shops line up, mismatched, suddenly related, like cousins meeting after years.<words>353</words>
I feel their weight, metaphysical and still real, metaphysically physical as a pulse against fingers.<words>368</words>
I play alone, yet not alone, because the rules insist the audience I feared is me.<words>384</words>
In the near distance inside myself, I hear that improv laugh folding into a welcome.<words>399</words>
The game ends not with victory but with a shared breath, and the tower agrees.<words>414</words>
I sign the rulebook quietly, promising future players an escape that circles back as home.<words>429</words>
When I pocket the ticket, it warms, reminding me admission is a verb I choose.<words>444</words>
I lower the blinds and listen as the clocks, finally noticed, start telling better time.<words>459</words></story>
