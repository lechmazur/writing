I am a skeptical minstrel who sings only after I verify the echo. <words>13</words>
Today my stage is a disappearing ink factory, asleep at the hush of an empty mailbox at midday. <words>31</words>
I came to tune a plot to out-scheme an immortal trickster whose pranks had rewritten my contracts mid performance. <words>50</words>
His audacity offends me, yet I study it with irreverent awe, the way sailors study storms they plan to surf. <words>70</words>
News travels here via the hiss of an ancient steam vent in an abandoned factory, a whispering pipeline that smears rumors like ink dissolving in breath. <words>96</words>
From my satchel I draw a dragon-scale armor scrap, cut from a legend whose hide flashed like stained glass in thunder. <words>117</words>
The trickster covets what cannot be owned, so I bait him with this shard and a plan impossibly plausible to his gluttony for loopholes. <words>141</words>
I script an auction of reckless generosity, promising to give the scrap to whichever stranger proves another stranger more deserving. <words>161</words>
The bids are written in disappearing ink brewed from the vats around me, so truth here must sprint to exist. <words>181</words>
I load each pledge into a slingshot of copper tubing and fire them through the vent, where words return as steamed signatures. <words>203</words>
As promises collide midair, I remember my first tour, when the trickster tipped me with a map to a town that never existed, and the applause never ended. <words>231</words>
I sang for years to ghosts who did not know they were gone, earning coin that evaporated in sunlight. <words>250</words>
Today my tune is bait and refuge, a chorus coded to break only when he cannot resist correcting its meter. <words>270</words>
I promise to gift the shard to the last bidder who admits they are undeserving, a paradox that the steam translates into a contract he cannot ignore. <words>297</words>
When he arrives as a fidgeting breeze tasting of citrus and thunder, I bow, and the factory obliges by uncapping a new hiss shaped like a welcome. <words>324</words>
He laughs, promising to improve my spectacle, and I answer with a verse about mirrors that reflect debts, the notes stitched to the scrap like scales remember heat. <words>352</words>
I slingshot the shard upward, and every bidder I invented donates their claim to the next, a ladder of reckless generosity the trickster must climb to reach me. <words>380</words>
At the top he declares himself undeserving, because he wants everything, and the steam seals his confession into ink that will not disappear for him. <words>405</words>
The factory doors swing like applause, and the mailbox outside yawns awake exactly as midday hush ends, proof that timing can be both accident and art. <words>431</words>
I pocket the contract, hand the shard to a soot stained child who fixed my strings, and sing with new skepticism: belief that is impossibly plausible. <words>457</words>
