I woke between heartbeats to the hush of the lunar mining colony, my visor fogging with borrowed breath. <words>18</words>
They call me an ambivalent prophet, which is tidy marketing for a person who predicts and flinches simultaneously. <words>36</words>
My latest vision arrived like a sly cough, happily sad, full of bashful arrogance and the smell of ozone. <words>55</words>
It told me the final oath was overdue, and that I alone must scramble the cosmic scoreboard before the hoarders woke. <words>76</words>
I keep my tools where the miners keep their superstitions, in a dented locker lined with lunar dust and regrets. <words>96</words>
Inside lies a collection of marbles, cracked, each a tiny moon with fractures like lightning trapped in glass. <words>114</words>
I roll them across the metal floor, listening to their starved clacking echo through tunnels that remember older gulfs. <words>133</words>
They map error into pattern the way scars make a face unique, inviting me to defragment a shattered itinerary. <words>152</words>
I begin through jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box, each tooth a coordinate, each hole a hungry sky. <words>173</words>
The edges fit the marbles like explanations wearing clothes, and a map emerges that argues with the geometry of fear. <words>193</words>
I am happily sad about it, smirking at my own trembling hands, blushing at the certainty that mistakes chose me. <words>213</words>
The colony thrums like a sleeping drill, while I fit edges to fractures and hear the oath whisper from the gaps. <words>234</words>
It says the final oath is not a promise but a permission slip signed in humility yet read aloud with bashful arrogance. <words>256</words>
It also says the scoreboard is wrong by design, and that I must cut a window where they plotted a wall. <words>277</words>
So I tilt the marbles toward the low sun, and their cracks blaze like tiny fault lines announcing a kinder tectonics. <words>298</words>
Between heartbeats, numbers fall off my heads-up display, then reorganize like migrants finding cousins in a crowded port. <words>316</words>
I watch, both priest and saboteur, as luck distributions shuffle, debts forgive themselves, and the payroll forgives the air. <words>335</words>
The miners will wake richer in sleep and poorer in grudges, confused, relieved, and newly dangerous to anyone selling bitterness. <words>355</words>
I seal the oath by breathing on the cold glass, fog printing a private sigil that evaporates the moment certainty arrives. <words>376</words>
Ambivalence is not a flaw, the vision whispers, but a hinge that lets a door open without crushing either side. <words>396</words>
So I bow to both futures, grin like a saint with pockets full of cracked planets, and step softly into the next beat. <words>419</words>
