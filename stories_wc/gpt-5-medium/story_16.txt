Steam sighed like a tired organ in the steampunk airship engine room, in the hush after the final guest leaves a wedding. <words>22</words>
I am the freelancer who freelances everything, a toolkit with feet, hired to tune boilers, officiate vows, and file histories nobody else dares. <words>45</words>
Tonight my contract is to chronicle elder wisdom before the steam goes cold, to bottle breath and keep it from vanishing. <words>66</words>
An amber ring tints my notes honey, a little sun smuggled from a grandmother who whispered that engines remember what people forget. <words>88</words>
The pistons chant counterpoint, scattered harmony in brass and leather, while lanterns swing like tired metronomes keeping time for ghosts of revelers. <words>110</words>
Elders had danced above, and below they left me stories stuck under bolts, jokes scratched into rivets, and a question shaped like ballast. <words>133</words>
The estate's automaton archivist whirs awake, a polite sentinel who refuses me access, citing protocols thicker than soot. <words>151</words>
I tell it that memory is a machine taught by regret, and hear myself sound inadvertently profound, like a wrench preaching to a turbine. <words>175</words>
It demands the amber ring as authorization, because the last engineer bound master keys to heirlooms to keep bureaucracy from dismembering love. <words>197</words>
But I remember her last good intention, a story half told: let the ship teach its caretakers, not the other way around. <words>219</words>
To outwit the archivist without betraying her mischief, I stand by the flywheel and count heartbeats against the bulkhead. <words>238</words>
Then I throttle valves with the rhythm of waves against a cliff, teaching the engine a shore it has never seen. <words>259</words>
The room answers with surf of steam, gull cries in whistles, and the automaton nods, fooled by cadence into recognizing a captain's lullaby. <words>282</words>
I press the amber ring to the memory manifold, and panels unfold like petals, releasing cylinders of recorded counsel warm as bread. <words>304</words>
Elder voices fog the glass and dictate recipes for mercy, torque specifications for arguments, and maps to harbors where strangers greet by name. <words>327</words>
Each lesson arrives offbeat yet orchestrated, scattered harmony resolving into a march that even my restless feet can follow. <words>346</words>
The archivist lowers its gears, conceding that intention outranks instruction when the ship itself keeps time across brass, bone, and book. <words>367</words>
I write fast, freelancing reverence, freelancing grief, freelancing applause for everything that almost failed yet held, while the ring warms my knuckle. <words>389</words>
Perhaps my talent is simply arranging screws and syllables until they click, inadvertently profound only because I listen to their threads. <words>410</words>
When dawn leans through portholes, I leave the engine room carrying the last good intention made real, a chronicle beating like surf inside me. <words>434</words>
