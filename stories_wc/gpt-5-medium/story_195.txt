In the nomad caravan, I worked as a forlorn roustabout whose tasks rarely aligned with my unruly pulse. <words>18</words>
Throughout spring cleaning, our wagons exhaled dust like old prayers, and I inventoried ropes, pots, and the smaller mysteries hiding between them. <words>40</words>
One mystery was a small spool of thread wrapped in moonsilver lint, humming whenever I breathed close. <words>57</words>
It pricked the edge of curiosity like a seamstress needle testing skin, polite yet insisting on entry. <words>74</words>
I am analytically unpredictable, charting feelings the way others chart dunes, but overturning the maps as soon as they look accurate. <words>95</words>
That thread taught me to navigate by tracking moon trails, lighting faint paths along tent seams and wheel spokes each cloudless night. <words>117</words>
I felt a joyful sorrow open under my ribs, a song for places I had never left yet always missed. <words>137</words>
The caravan master, iron-browed and careful, carried a hardened heart, and I wanted to reveal the child within it. <words>156</words>
If I could, perhaps the roads would loosen, and our laughter would stop sounding like coins dropped into a well. <words>176</words>
Each evening, I let the small spool whisper, trailing silver logic from his wagon to the dunes where moonlight pooled. <words>196</words>
When the thread tugged at his sleeve, the master would grunt, then sprint after the glimmer, curiosity outrunning his practiced suspicion. <words>217</words>
We traveled by tracking moon trails across potsherd flats, the spool drawing constellations on ground, connecting stories he once refused to name. <words>239</words>
Throughout spring cleaning by day, I scrubbed pans while he sorted ledgers, but at night he counted the thin luminescent stitches. <words>260</words>
He began telling me about a paper kite, a childhood river, and a mother who danced herself warm in winter wind. <words>281</words>
I wove the thread through torn tent flaps, repairing not fabric alone but the silence that made his orders brittle. <words>301</words>
My choices stayed analytically unpredictable: praise when he expected critique, questions when he desired obedience, and quiet when his pride needed air. <words>323</words>
One wind-stirred night a dust storm charged us, and he reached for books, but I made him sprint toward the glowing sewing of safety. <words>347</words>
The dunes folded around a dry arroyo where moon trails pooled bright as milk, and he laughed, sudden, like a child with wet shoes. <words>371</words>
His hardened heart unlatched, and he told the wind he forgave the river for leaving, and himself for surviving it. <words>391</words>
In that joyful sorrow, I tucked the small spool away, knowing the edge of curiosity had become the seam of our home. <words>413</words>
