The suspended palace anchored to giant stalactites hummed like a tuning fork above the ink-dark cavern sea. <words>17</words>
In its walkways lived a whimsical tinkerer who believed in practical illusion more than in prayers. <words>33</words>
He wore an oddly truthful smile, a kind that measured lies the way his brass thermometer measured drifting, treacherous heat. <words>53</words>
Today he promised the palace an answer to why the air tasted older each dawn. <words>68</words>
He would chronicle environmental changes not with charts but through pop-up carnival fortune-tellers that appeared on balconies like migrating birds. <words>88</words>
Their painted automata shuffled cards cut from lichen maps, and their voices, oddly truthful, sang the temperature of tomorrow. <words>107</words>
He wound the cranks, checked the brass thermometer, and began to sculpt the palace air with fans, kites, and cooling veils. <words>128</words>
Each draft redirected fog past the gardens and into organ pipes that translated wind into probabilities. <words>144</words>
The fortune-tellers replied with tickets stamped yes or no, little or a lot, live or remember. <words>160</words>
Their answers were not prophecies but audits of the moment, strangely tender and meticulously cruel. <words>175</words>
As the artist in residence lifted his brush toward canvas, time draped itself thin, and the palace settled into a single, endless inhale. <words>198</words>
The tinkerer stepped beneath a skylight of quartz to witness what an artist's brush first meets canvas can hold: a breath-long forever. <words>220</words>
In that dilated sliver, he faced his own mortality reflected in the brass thermometer, the column of quicksilver shivering like a thin, startled bone. <words>244</words>
If the air kept aging, the palace would descend, anchors gnawed by warmth until stalactites let go, and all his practical illusion would prove only rehearsal. <words>270</words>
Oddly truthful, he wrote a diagnosis on a fortune ticket: we are finite, the cave less so, and the distance to ground is exact. <words>294</words>
He did not despair; he adjusted vanes, tuned pipes, and taught the automata to ask for stories about winters that no longer froze. <words>317</words>
Through pop-up carnival fortune-tellers, he traded futures for data, offering palm readings in exchange for remembrances of storms, tides, and the ache of vanished ice. <words>342</words>
The artist watched, brush just touching gesso, and understood the commission: paint heat as a character who learns to apologize. <words>362</words>
He mixed bone white with cadmium and let the first wet spark bloom, while the tinkerer counted heartbeats against the thermometer's twitch. <words>384</words>
The palace listened, cables singing, and the stalactites answered by sweating slow, mineral tears. <words>398</words>
When an artist's brush first meets canvas, he realized, a life can sculpt itself honest: tally the heat, confess the limits, and build a kinder illusion sturdy enough to keep everyone aloft. <words>430</words>
