<story>Between commercials, I slip back into the secret society treasure vault, where silence breathes like velvet over sleeping gold. <words>19</words>
I am a naive summoner, apprenticed to echoes and receipts, learning to call what listens more than what answers. <words>38</words>
Tonight my teacher is a piece of a broken statue, its marble shoulder veined like a map of hushed continents. <words>58</words>
I collected it through rumor-charged midnight gatherings, where whispers are seeds of understanding and every secret is watered by careful breath. <words>79</words>
The vault is peculiarly virtual, its aisles flickering between codes and dust, so that touch arrives a second after contact. <words>99</words>
I came to elevate the quiet, to hum a lullaby loud enough to be heard by fate, yet intimate as mothwings. <words>120</words>
The timing matters; the city softens between commercials, when living rooms exhale, and the world resets its blinking cursors of attention. <words>141</words>
I place my ear to the cold shoulder and plant the seeds with breath, my note trembling like a candle discovering corridors. <words>163</words>
Above me, the society's minutes hang from wires, paper moths of apology and ambition, brushing my hair in hesitant approval. <words>183</words>
I remember the gatherings, my naivete wearing borrowed velvet, believing rumors were ladders rather than winds, climbing anyway because the stars seemed near. <words>206</words>
Now the seeds of understanding germinate in my throat, swelling syllables into tethers that bind what hopes to vanish. <words>225</words>
The statue fragment listens, remembering its missing hands, and a finger of light unfolds, beckoning me to finish an old pose. <words>246</words>
I elevate the fragment onto a pedestal that isn't there, a pedestal the software of air invents because I ask gently. <words>267</words>
Images scroll through the vault like tide: grandparents forgetting, children waiting, lovers returning, each scene pausing as my hum grows steadier. <words>288</words>
A distant warmth comes from nowhere and everywhere, like a letter arriving unstamped, assuring me the address was always the music. <words>309</words>
Fate is not a person here, but a corridor with doors ajar, listening for lullabies that keep storms sleeping in their cribs. <words>331</words>
The ad break ticks down; the vault's lights blink warnings, and I lengthen the note until it bridges every blinking interval. <words>352</words>
The fragment remembers the statue it once supported, and I, still naive, feel taller, as if my shadow borrowed grandparents and patience. <words>374</words>
When the society returns, they'll invent rumors explaining the bloom, but rumor-charged midnight gatherings were only soil; the song was weather. <words>395</words>
As commercials end, I pocket the gentle shard, and go upstairs humming, certain fate has heard, and will keep listening between scenes. <words>417</words>
