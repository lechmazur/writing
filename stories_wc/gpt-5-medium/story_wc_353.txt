<story>It is after the hedgehog uncurls when I return to the siskin alder grove. [14]
The air keeps still as parchment, intensely quiet, as if noise were a delicate moth. [29]
I am the tree-song sculptor, and today I listen to trunks like tuning forks. [43]
I came here to create music in a silent world, and the trees know why. [58]
Since the last storm, their fibers ache with unsung phrases, and I am symphonically minded. [73]
I move slowly between alders, feeling rings beneath bark, empathy in motion guiding my hands. [88]
A hedgerow glows with dew, and a porcelain insulator dangles from a broken telegraph line. [103]
It spins gently in the stillness, a pale bell with a thread of cold. [117]
I take it because I will need a voice shaped from silence, hard and brittle. [132]
The grove remembers a sculpture once carved for thunder warnings, half buried near the oldest stump. [148]
I kneel there and brush aside husks, uncovering the long-forgotten sculpture with careful breaths. [162]
Its body is cracked like dry riverbeds, each fracture a faultline of memory and movement. [177]
I tune my senses by analyzing stress cracks in a long-forgotten sculpture, listening for hidden cadences. [193]
The lines teach me where the sap once danced, empathy in motion etched into clay and ash. [210]
I thread fibers of alder root through the porcelain insulator and anchor it in the grooves. [226]
It hangs like a mute larynx, waiting for lungs we cannot see, waiting for me. [241]
I pluck a reed, twist it to a plectrum, and prepare my right hand to strum. [257]
The first touch is a rumor of sound, barely more than a leaf turning inward. [272]
The second touch travels along the carved ribs, and the alder trunks answer with soft pressure. [288]
They do not hum; they breathe, widening their pores like sleepers adjusting quilts. [301]
I keep my motions small, for the world is listening for a promise, not a performance. [317]
The porcelain insulator vibrates in a whisper register, translating my fingertips into distant bellnotes. [331]
A song begins to collect in the grove like fog, its phrases rising from the roots. [347]
I lean my ear to bark and hear tenderness moving, empathy in motion made audible. [362]
Somewhere a jay tries to call, but the call decides to remain unborn. [375]
The hedgehog pauses at the path's lip, reassured by the hush and the slow rhythm. [390]
I realize each tree has carried a single unsaid word, held for years like withheld applause. [406]
My task is not to shout but to coax those words to share their edges. [421]
I shift the insulator, feeling its porcelain skin against the old fractures, a bridge joining ghosts. [437]
The tone deepens, and with it a memory of early river ice moving without cracking. [452]
I understand then that the grove does not want a symphony; it wants a pulse. [467]
It wants a companionable heartbeat to follow, the kind a lost one offers while walking beside. [483]
So I surrender cleverness, and I strum only enough to keep that heartbeat steady. [497]
Alder leaves flutter like eyelids nearing sleep, and the hedgehog uncurls entirely, fearless. [510]
I whisper thanks to the old sculpture, which taught me by analyzing stress cracks and patience. [526]
Its duty is finished, but mine continues, because I came here to create music in a silent world. [544]
The pulse becomes a path, and I walk it, guiding my steps by unvoiced syllables. [559]
Each step breathes into the porcelain, and the porcelain returns breath to roots and soil. [574]
This is empathy in motion again, not a theory, but a practice of shared weight. [589]
I feel the alder remember drought, windbreak, and sheltering a fox den through bitter nights. [604]
It tells me without words that art is a vessel for bearing those remembrances safely. [619]
I answer with careful patterns, and the grove releases a sigh that rustles only inward. [634]
The porcelain insulator cools, dimming the higher chime, and the lower notes settle like loam. [649]
I stop before stopping is heard, letting the last vibration nest under bark. [662]
A light rain begins without sound, each drop a private footstep that never reaches ground. [677]
The hedgehog tucks into a hollow of leaves, and even its tiny breath feels orchestral. [692]
I tie the insulator to a branch, not as a relic, but as a promise. [707]
If wind returns, it will find its way through, and our pulse will resume. [721]
Until then, the siskin alder grove keeps faith, storing the score inside living wood. [735]
I leave on the softest path, carrying the plectrum, leaving the music where it belongs. [750]
Behind me, a breath of hush follows, and the world remains quiet but no longer silent. [766]
It is enough for tonight, enough for roots and paws, and enough for my listening. [781]</story>
