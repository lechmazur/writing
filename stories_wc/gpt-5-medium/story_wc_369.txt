<story>The night was a welder of edges in the stormlit tower by moonlight. [13]
I was the labyrinth maintenance worker, and the maze below me sighed like a sleeping boiler. [29]
Every hinge, latch, and hidden wheel was my jurisdiction, and sometimes my only conversation. [43]
On the parapet sat the astronomer's broken sextant, its angles shivering whenever lightning blinked. [57]
I had found it jammed between vines in the upper stair, where no astronomer had any business climbing. [75]
Perhaps the tower collected lost instruments the way gutters gather leaves. [86]
I kept it because some things feel like they are waiting for repair, and some things feel like they are waiting for witness. [109]
I wanted to discover what trees witness, and the labyrinth kept its answers in the slow groan of its roots. [129]
To be honest, trees had watched me more faithfully than people ever had. [142]
Their patience made me suspect that time was a tool we barely deserved to hold. [157]
So I made a plan both foolish and ordinary. [166]
I would deconstruct my grief the way I deconstructed clogged drains and misaligned walls. [180]
I would do it by mapping scattered dreams, because dreams fell like dust in these rooms and stuck to my boots. [201]
Each morning I swept their grit into little hills and measured them with a tea spoon I retired from the break room. [223]
It was my first experiment in quantified sorrow, a practice that embarrassed me until it began to work. [241]
The sextant lay beside the hills of dream dust like a small ruined animal, but when the moon cleared, its brass seams warmed. [264]
The instrument heals in moonlight, I wrote in my ledger, as if the sentence might someday convince a committee. [283]
I opened its spine and found a hairline crack where a measuring arc had split, a sorrow line like a river on a map. [307]
Below, the labyrinth coughed in the rain, and a corridor waited for me to hear it. [323]
Most nights it was loud with old stories, but sometimes the tower breathed and locked the air into a vault. [343]
When that hush came, every screw, nail, and pin turned into a messenger. [356]
It happened at the moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor, and my job stopped being about leaks. [376]
The pin hit stone with the soft clink of a key admitting guilt, and the sextant trembled. [393]
I followed the sound into the lower ring, past a web of dripping chains that looked like silvered vines. [412]
There I found a tree root breaching a wall, snake thick, its bark polished by the touch of passing shoulders. [432]
Trees were listening, I thought, and sometimes answering with their bodies. [443]
I pressed the sextant against the root and watched the crack align with a seam in the bark. [461]
Lightning flashed, the tower filled with milk blue breath, and the needle on the instrument jerked. [477]
Where it pointed, I excavated mortar with my pocket knife and the dull side of my small wrench. [495]
Behind the wall lay a sliver of room no wider than my shoulders, and it breathed like a sleeping dog. [515]
Inside were tags made of metal, each stamped with a number and a word not in any language I knew. [535]
I recognized them anyway, as if recognition could be measured, as if sorrow could wear a badge. [552]
The labyrinth had been archiving what the trees witnessed, and the tags were their minutes of meetings. [569]
Some were bent, some were rusted to the sharpness of sugar, and some shone with moon brightness. [586]
I took them out, arranged them by weight, and then by the ache they stirred in my chest. [604]
The moon rose, the crack in the sextant sealed as if laced from within, and I began to read the minutes. [625]
A storm decades ago, a child naming a stray cat someday, a maple counting a winter of sparrows, all entered me like rinse water. [649]
Their sorrow did not drown me, because it had already been measured, and measured grief will float if you let it. [670]
I logged each tag into my ledger, not with words, but with small drawings of angles that the sextant taught my hand. [692]
The labyrinth hummed as the maps formed, and the tower stopped leaking in every place I had not yet fixed. [712]
Mundane miracles are like that, they arrive with schedules and clipboards, and they sign our receipts. [728]
By dawn the sextant was whole, the corridor had forgiven its pin, and the root had curled back into the wall. [749]
I washed the tea spoon, swept the hills of dream dust into a jar, and labeled it not as dust, but as minutes yet unread. [774]
When I went outside, every tree gleamed as if just rained, and I could finally hear the register of their quiet. [795]</story>
