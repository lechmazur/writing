<story>The night I chose my last alias, the ceiling shook with the dim thunder of orchestra tuning. <words>17</words>
Aboveground, politicians gathered for a gala, but I worked beneath them in an underground orchard fed by bio-luminescent fungus. <words>36</words>
I am the ghostwriter for politicians, the invisible gardener of their words, pruning promises and grafting alibis with careful, poetically rational hands. <words>58</words>
Saplings trembled while the violas hissed above, and my lamp stirred the spores into a slow, lunar snowfall. <words>76</words>
Beside my stool sat a pair of worn leather sandals, the only thing I kept from the life that never fit. <words>97</words>
They smelled like salt and train smoke, and their straps remembered every road my names had fled. <words>114</words>
I wrote tonight not in memos but through coded stanzas in shipwrecked journals I salvaged from a drowned library. <words>133</words>
Each stanza housed a seed, and each seed a cipher, and each cipher a map of secret identities. <words>151</words>
My clients wore masks for the cameras, but I wore masks inside the ink, because destiny resents naked faces. <words>170</words>
I had come here to gain control of one's destiny, beginning with my own, by collapsing the stage from below. <words>190</words>
So I composed a speech that would corrode the bright chrome of certainty while appearing to polish it. <words>208</words>
It praised transparency and obedience, then tucked a rusted blade between clauses, a blade named doubt. <words>224</words>
When the oboes wailed their warmups, roots ticked like clocks, and I felt the orchard lean to listen. <words>242</words>
The fungus drank our breath and exhaled green light across the bark, etching silhouettes of every promise I had faked. <words>262</words>
I slipped on the sandals, and their cracked soles promised blisters, a proof of travel no passport could counterfeit. <words>281</words>
In the journals, the metered currents of my lines pointed toward a vault where the campaign kept its unspent truths. <words>301</words>
I would leak them without leaking, orchestrate a confession amid orchestra tuning, the rosin haze like weather inside a lung. <words>321</words>
Cameras could not capture what grows under the world, but cameras obey stories, and stories obey whoever tends the roots. <words>341</words>
I tended them like equations, function by function, letting metaphor irrigate reason until both braided into something sharp. <words>359</words>
Soon the speech would be spoken by a smiling minister whose childhood I had invented with cinnamon and borrowed light. <words>379</words>
When applause climbed the room, my counterpoint would move through their systems, a soft acid of second thoughts. <words>397</words>
Policies would corrode at the edges, not from sabotage, but from citizens recognizing themselves in the omissions they had tolerated. <words>417</words>
And I, at last, would stop mistaking service for destiny, and begin rewriting destiny as service to a truer name. <words>437</words>
The orchard nodded, thunder curled, and the violins sketched a horizon, messy yet precise, like my plan, like my breath. <words>457</words>
I closed the journals, patted the sandals like restless dogs, and climbed toward the music, every step a clarified risk. <words>477</words>
If I must remain a ghostwriter, let me haunt the future until it signs my name and opens the orchard to dawn. <words>499</words></story>
