<story>After time becomes visible, the baroque asteroid glowed with veils of years draped over its battered cornices. [17]
The past no longer whispered; it hung like gilt dust, spinning in drafts from the ruptured salons and chapels. [36]
I was a defunct revolutionary, officially archived as a cautionary footnote, unofficially tolerated as a guide through debris. [54]
When the astromancers declared the site open to scholarship, an archaeological dispute ignited like lacquer touched by flame. [72]
Professor Ledger insisted the vanished court had been ornamented tyrants, curators of immaculate cruelty and sterile pageant. [89]
I, poetically inclined even when starving, remembered rumors of communal feasts, anonymous artisans, and voluntary dissolutions of rank. [107]
If the asteroid taught a lesson, it was that ornament might be solidarity at scale, curve upon curve of gathered breath. [128]
To reimagine an entire civilization, I needed proof shaped like more than longing or slogans. [143]
Proof arrived as a crystal vase shard I found fused within a rib of oxidized velvet iron. [160]
Its edges sang when struck by the breezes that herded the visible seconds through our scaffolding. [176]
Microscopic etchings ribboned its interior, not letters exactly, more like breath marks for a silent choir. [192]
Ledger laughed, saying servants scribble in their glass to mimic the speech of gods. [206]
But the shard vibrated when storms made the minutes stream, and the vibration carried cadence, a lost scansion. [224]
I devised a ritual familiar from my childhood uprisings, when we hid from soldiers and superstitions alike. [241]
During storms we covered mirrors, every last reflective oval and facet, so the past would not catch us looking back. [261]
Now I ordered the excavation galleries shrouded whenever the time-squalls came, sheets over display gloss and visor glass. [279]
With the mirrors blind, the shard became the only stage in the room, and its song strengthened. [296]
I pressed it to my temple and translated the rises and rests into words, hesitant, burnished, sorrowing. [313]
They spoke of ceremonies where any citizen could ascend the dais and lay their craft beside another's craft. [331]
Not pageant, but pooling; not domination, but ornament as ledger for debts canceled by beauty and labor. [348]
Ledger accused me of ventriloquy, of letting my poet's hunger invent a past to console a failed revolt. [366]
He petitioned the council to strip my access, citing contamination by ideology, as if his certainty were not its own fever. [387]
I answered with public readings of the shard during storms, summoning crowds who wished to see songs rather than scarps. [407]
We stood in the rubric-lit colonnades while the minutes rained, and the covered mirrors sighed like sleeping swans. [425]
I recited the shard's breathing and watched faces loosen, as if bolts within them were falling softly away. [443]
Afterward, some brought me scraps of tracery, seed beads, coins, and bits of intaglio, asking if they too might sing. [463]
Each object hummed faintly under the stormlight, as though the city had taught its furnishings to remember the crowd. [482]
I wrote a treatise that was also a sequence of poems, arguing for ornament as archive, for song as statistic. [502]
Ledger responded with graphs and mockery, declaring my procedure an exorcism masquerading as method, a superstition about mirrors. [520]
I conceded the superstition and kept the method, because covering mirrors during storms let the shard speak without echo. [539]
Without reflective distraction, time's veils ceased preening and fell straight, letting us read the people's breaths rather than our desires. [559]
In the council hall, with planets ticking like clockwork grapes beyond the window, the adjudication became performance. [576]
Ledger presented photographs where the nobility carved their initials into citizens like signatures across invoices. [591]
I carried the shard, wrapped in velvet, and asked for a storm to be admitted, a minute's worth at least. [611]
The astromancers obliged, opening a slit in the observatory skin, and the years drizzled in like smoke. [628]
We covered every mirror, from the mayoral portrait to the polished boots of the guards, linen upon patent. [646]
I placed the shard upon the rostrum, struck it with a feathered baton, and began to measure the breathing. [665]
The hall filled with the hum of a thousand extinct hands working together, raising a colonnade without speaking any names. [685]
When I translated, the words were simple: we made, we made, we made, until the making made us equal. [704]
Ledger tried to laugh again, but his laughter met the covered glass and returned to him muffled, perplexed, and aging. [724]
The council voted to revise the archive, not as apology but as ornament, a layering of truths that honored labor. [744]
My revolution remained defunct, a futility minted in my bones, but the civilization we shared looked different in the light. [764]
Time kept shining around the cornices, and storms kept coming, and we kept covering mirrors, not to forget but to listen. [785]
When the shard cracked, its tenderness bowed me, and sorrow shone, burnished. [797]</story>
