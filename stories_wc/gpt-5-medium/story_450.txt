<story>I slid into the thought experiment chamber while the attendant ran bubble baths like a tide rehearsing its calculus. <words>19</words>
Steam feathered the mirrors, and I pinned a patch from a crashed spaceship mission over the scar on my heart. <words>39</words>
The patch had survived metal fatigue, orbital fire, and our family's stubborn silence, bearing the weight of denial like ballast. <words>59</words>
I am a sharp-witted dancer, but I am linguistically inept, so I let my body do the arguing. <words>77</words>
Every move here would be recorded next to the yearly frames in a family tradition of taking a yearly family photo. <words>98</words>
This year, the composition would decide whether the final prophecy with a twist was choreography or superstition. <words>115</words>
Mother left me the chamber access and the patch, along with a sentence I could not translate without dance. <words>134</words>
So I mimic the message, step by step, a practiced echo of her EVA footage embedded in our broken archives. <words>154</words>
The chamber projected planetary lattices against the suds, and I traced them with ankles, wrists, ribs, until memory stung. <words>173</words>
I kept failing the language prompts, my answers reduced to splashes and angles, but the sensors respected my fluent hesitation. <words>193</words>
Saturated ambivalence fogged the air, heavy as lavender, because wanting truth and fearing it are Siamese twins stitched at the breath. <words>214</words>
On cue, bubbles crowned my shoulders, and the patch darkened, leaking letters that only movement could line into meaning. <words>233</words>
I spun the camera toward the mirror and composed the frame, an orbit of soap, scar, and stitched insignia. <words>252</words>
The yearly family photo had always pretended we were whole, yet the choreography revealed how denial choreographs the hole. <words>271</words>
I mirrored my mother's last recorded stance, knees flexed, chin high, fingers splayed like antennae searching for a kinder orbit. <words>291</words>
Water kissed the patch and lifted a second emblem, a star map that looked like a family tree bent by gravity. <words>312</words>
The twist arrived when the coordinates formed the date of the crash and the caption we had always cropped out. <words>332</words>
It read, We turned back to save the launch crew, and our success was erased to spare the board their shame. <words>353</words>
The weight of denial had not been ours alone, yet we had carried it like heirs bound to a curse of silence. <words>375</words>
I finished the shot and bowed, answering the prophecy by breathing. <words>386</words>
The chamber printed the frame, and the bubbles hushed like jurors. <words>397</words>
I had come here to fulfill a final prophecy with a twist, and the twist was acceptance. <words>414</words>
Words still refused me, but my muscles could finally stop miming absence. <words>426</words>
I sent the photo to my family, inviting them to dance the caption back into the record. <words>443</words>
Next year, when the baths are drawn, we will pose with the patch, the map, and no more cropping. <words>462</words>
Until then, the chamber keeps time, and I rehearse an honest silence that needs no translation. <words>478</words>
