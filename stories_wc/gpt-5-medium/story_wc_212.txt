<story>I am the heirloom seed saver who tends the last orchard in the city of glass. [16]
Tonight, I keep watch in the icebound atrium under starlight, where breath hangs like frost-laced bells. [32]
We are here after the egg hatches, after the crack like a small thunder, after the hush that teaches. [51]
The creature inside is no bird but a spiral of seedlings, a pinwheel of germs of forests yet to be. [71]
It opens as if exhaling a library, and the cold air fills with the scent of rain that has not fallen. [92]
My hands are furiously tranquil, steady in their storm, cupping the newborn vortex like a candle flame. [109]
I have waited my whole life for this whirl to arrive, because I was taught the principle of vortex inheritance. [129]
It is how our line receives seasons; not by land deeds, but by swirls of time that choose a keeper. [149]
My grandmother said the whirl would come as an egg, find me among the benches, and ask for a name. [169]
I named it Return, because I am here to discover the texture of borrowed time, and to give it back wisely. [190]
On the marble beside me rests an oak acorn cap, varnished by years of pocket warmth, the proof of a promise. [211]
When I was eight, I tried to reopen a ruined seed vault, and the door answered with a storm of dust. [232]
It was my grandmother who tapped my wrist with this cap and said, patient, little oak, time is a lidded well. [253]
Now the lid is lifting in circles, and the atrium groans, windows veined with ice that maps the sky in silver. [274]
The creature of seeds unfurls until it becomes a memory engine, its veins braided with veins of frost. [292]
It thrums with wild serenity, and the panes above answer with star-blink echoes, as if constellations were gears. [310]
Return drifts to my shoulder and pours a draft of invisible pollen down my spine, and I see the orchard unborn. [331]
The roots braid through years of rubble and laughter, and every pit of fruit is a door someone forgot to lock. [352]
They open only by decreasing entropy, Return murmurs without sound, not by force but by pattern remembered. [369]
I understand that the measure of keeping is not storage but song, not hoarding but humming a sequence in the cold. [390]
I place the oak acorn cap upon the whirling heart, and it steadies like a child who sees a familiar face. [411]
The cap becomes a wheel hub, and the seeds align, from amaranth skulls to beans that remember summer handshakes. [430]
My breath fogs the glass, a prayer that draws a spiral in the frost, and Return teaches me how to turn the key. [453]
I sing the layouts of terraces I have never seen, their retaining walls stitched with lichens like old letters. [472]
I hum the names of women whose hands I have inherited, not their rings, but their gestures and their seasons. [492]
The vortex softens, thread by thread, and winter inside the atrium recedes like a recalcitrant tide. [508]
Ferns awaken in their bottles; moss dreams; a citrus shivers and throws a single blossom that smells like a door. [528]
The egg shell of Return splits into ribbons and becomes a path, and I step into the seasons threaded like beads. [549]
I want not to own them but to feel their nap and grain, to discover the texture of borrowed time, then pass through. [572]
In spring I am dirt under fingernails; in summer I am shade; in autumn I am smoke; in winter I am breath. [594]
When I return to the atrium, the stars lean closer, pleased, and my grandmother stands in the pattern of frost. [614]
She is made of evenings and recipes, and she nods at my hands, at the cap, at the way the vortex rests. [636]
You kept it without keeping it, she says, and the words land like seeds in my pockets and sprout little songs. [657]
We hold silence while snow tickles the glass and starlight feeds the leaves, and I taste the clean edge of purpose. [678]
Return settles into the oak acorn cap like a hearth, and I feel the city beyond the panes tip toward spring. [699]
I bend down and plant the cap in a pot of loam, and I hear a tiny room inside me reopen to birdsong. [722]
A rootlets first arithmetic begins, solving the dark, and the atrium warms a fraction, enough to thaw a promise. [741]
I will be keeper as long as the pattern holds, and when it loosens, I will teach the next pair of hands the song. [765]
Together we will seed the years by decreasing entropy, not by clutching, but by remembering the whirl exactly. [783]</story>
