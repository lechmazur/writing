I am a joyless performer, rehearsing at the edge of a prismatic lake while the amphitheater around me stands amid construction, ribs of scaffolding reflecting fractured color. <words>27</words>
The water throws modestly extravagant shards of light across my hands, but the brightness only underlines how dull my applause-starved pulse has become. <words>50</words>
I practice tonight to hush the dissonance of old guilt, a restless chorus that clings like mist whenever the lake refracts my reflection into unflattering versions. <words>76</words>
I am torn between truths: that I abandoned my partner mid-act years ago, and that leaving may have saved us from a stunt we were not ready to survive. <words>105</words>
The park is closed, yet the empty playground beyond the barrier lends me a metronome via the echo of a squeaking seesaw, plaintive and precise. <words>130</words>
I organize my routine to its creak, steps aligning with each high whine then low groan, as if ballast might return to the wobbling ledger inside my ribs. <words>158</words>
From my pocket I palm a simple drawer knob, the last relic of the trunk we used to share, its thread biting my skin like a question unscrewed. <words>186</words>
I intend a modestly extravagant flourish, turning the knob into a star, flipping it through silvered air, then vanishing it into a cuff sewn by my absent friend. <words>214</words>
With cautious abandon I begin, accepting that my heart will arrive late to the music if I do not start without it. <words>236</words>
The prismatic lake answers my first step with wavering confetti, and scaffolds crack with wind, like an audience clearing throats before an uncertain ovation. <words>260</words>
I see Davi as the seesaw squeals, a memory in work boots counting me in, and the two truths jostle my balance until I almost drop the little planet. <words>289</words>
The echo rescues me, returning like a cue whispered backstage, and I ride its arc, catching the knob on my wrist, then sliding it along my knuckles like moonrise. <words>318</words>
Somewhere a welder strikes flame, and the construction hammers soften into percussion, granting the playground's lament a rhythm, making my breaths arrange themselves into careful measures. <words>344</words>
I am not rehearsing for an audience, I admit, but for the quiet that might follow if I perform the vanished act we never dared, to hush the dissonance that lingers. <words>375</words>
When I finally pocket the star and bow to the skeletal seats, I choose the more brutal truth, that my escape wounded us, and I speak it into the wind. <words>405</words>
The seesaw hushes, the lake unshatters, and though the applause remains imagined, I feel the drawer knob settle in my palm, not absolved, but organized into something I can carry forward. <words>436</words>
