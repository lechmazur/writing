They called me a restless conjurer long before I found the cave pearl diving school.<words>15</words>
I arrived because a road closure forces a change of plans, walking the limestone switchbacks by lantern and breath.<words>34</words>
The sea sighed inside the caverns, a layered tranquility that carried my doubts like shells rolling in foam.<words>52</words>
I had come to turn raw imagination into reality, or fail where others perfected breath and patience.<words>69</words>
The headmaster was gone, yet the teacher's legacy thrummed from stalactite to pupil as if the rock itself were remembering.<words>89</words>
Every lesson here was complexly simple, a knot you could untie only by letting the rope float.<words>106</words>
At the gate, I had to haggle for air tanks and time with a woman whose eyes reflected moonlight like coins.<words>127</words>
She wanted payment in stories, and I offered the promise of a new trick that honored what her teacher began.<words>147</words>
My only prop was a blank index card, soft from my pocket, ready to swallow or reveal whatever I dared.<words>167</words>
In the classroom chamber, students practiced lowering mirrors into sinkholes where the sea meets the mountain, timing their dives by vanishing light.<words>189</words>
Our exercises ended at the fleeting second a reflection vanishes in water, when truth and trickery share a borderless skin.<words>209</words>
The headmaster had taught them to conjure pearls without touching the oysters, patience pulling radiance out of darkness.<words>227</words>
I learned to still my hands while my mind ran, the restlessness redirected into noticing what others blink past.<words>246</words>
When my turn came, I placed the blank card on the mirror, and it drank the cave like a starved page.<words>267</words>
The woman from the gate watched as I slid both into the pool, chasing the card's pale echo under the arch of the tide.<words>291</words>
Below, I held my breath beside the students, counting heartbeats until the reflection vanished, and a streak of darkness opened.<words>311</words>
There, in the unlit instant, I reached through the mirror's memory and felt the headmaster's pulse guiding my fingers.<words>330</words>
I pulled the card back up, now heavy with a pearl of air, a trembling sphere that would burst if named too soon.<words>353</words>
We surfaced to a hush, layered tranquility inside us, while the woman counted the seconds between drips like a metronome for wonder.<words>375</words>
I let the sphere roll into her palm, and it held the cave in miniature, complexly simple and wholly alive.<words>395</words>
She nodded, then named the price I had promised: guard the teacher's legacy with invention.<words>410</words>
From that day, I conjure pearls from blankness and bring them to students who haggle only with fear.<words>428</words>
