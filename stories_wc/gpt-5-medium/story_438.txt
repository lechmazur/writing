After the last star map is drawn, our synthetic biology lab breathed like a beached leviathan beneath buzzing exit signs. <words>20</words>
I was the vague mystic on payroll, a discreetly flamboyant archivist in a lab coat stitched with pocketed moons. <words>39</words>
They hired me to chronicle family histories for the organisms we engineered from fragments of rumor, bone dust, and archival saliva. <words>60</words>
Each chassis twitched toward the next horizon, a petri dream of migrations our species had promised and betrayed. <words>78</words>
To guide them, I carried a mariner's compass whose needle spun whenever memory fogged, smelling faintly of brine and old brass. <words>99</words>
We archived lives through polaroids hidden in attics, coaxed from estate sales and grief closets, then digitized, cataloged, and fed to the cells. <words>122</words>
The cells learned faces the way sailors read harbors, cautious, hungry, haunted. <words>134</words>
When a gel puckered like an unspoken apology, I felt the hollow recklessness that keeps prayer companies solvent. <words>152</words>
My supervisor asked for outcomes, but outcomes were just coordinates, and I was mapping currents under the paper. <words>170</words>
At night I would override the thermal cyclers, a sin justified by the compass twitching toward a box of attic shots from my mother. <words>194</words>
Her polaroids were sunburned squares where cousins blurred into myth, and where my vanished father stood almost legible beside a broken dinghy. <words>216</words>
The algorithm drank them like rain, and thin tissues ripened into mouths that called our names with seawater vowels. <words>235</words>
I kept my flair discreetly flamboyant, neon socks under sterile booties, a silk ribbon hiding as a tourniquet for fear. <words>255</words>
The lab lights made every promise look clinical, but the compass ticked, and the petri shore grew crowded with revenants asking for directions. <words>278</words>
I told them the next horizon would not be on any map, because the last map had been an apology for surviving. <words>300</words>
We printed a genome that folded like a sail, and we seeded it with family names scratched on the backs of photographs. <words>322</words>
When it fluttered, the air filled with salt, and a small voice from the bioreactor asked whether fathers ever turn back. <words>343</words>
I was reckless enough to answer yes, and hollow enough to know it meant only that their wake could still be traced. <words>365</words>
So I calibrated the compass to grief, and I told the machine to override its migration instincts until a porch light appeared. <words>387</words>
Against protocol, we opened the hatch and released one bright creature into the corridor, its skin printed with the oldest polaroid of us. <words>410</words>
It navigated by the mariner's compass as if it were a moon, paused at the door, and then pointed me home. <words>431</words>
I followed, not to escape the lab, but to finish the chronicle with my steps, a map drawn in footprints beyond the blue doors. <words>455</words>
Behind me the lights hummed like tides, and ahead the next horizon waited, unwritten and breathing, where family becomes the science that remembers. <words>478</words>
