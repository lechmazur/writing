In the whispering gallery, my steps stitched silence into meaning while the dome returned every secret, and I measured myself with grandiose modesty. <words>23</words>
I am a blameless smuggler, not for innocence but for exact accounting of harms avoided, ferrying truth and contraband maps between ears that never meet. <words>48</words>
Tonight, during the final countdown to a ceremonial demolition, I sought to map forgotten tunnels beneath the city before the walls swallowed their own stories. <words>73</words>
Around my neck hung a child's skeleton key necklace, a relic from a vanished urchin whose sketches hinted at doors nobody living remembered. <words>96</words>
The only entrance remaining could be found by the scent of a garden at night, where jasmine clung to stone like a map made of breath. <words>122</words>
I am logically emotional, caring with arithmetic, ranking risks the way a choirmaster balances voices, allowing tenderness only where the structure can bear its note. <words>147</words>
Such bookkeeping is the art of survival, because sentiment without calculus collapses, and calculus without sentiment forgets why the breath should be saved at all. <words>172</words>
The gallery funneled a lover's whisper from the far balcony, delivering the rumors I needed: the engineers would overreach, cutting supports that held ancestral corridors. <words>197</words>
With minutes draining, I brushed the necklace against the mosaics, and tiny teeth ticked like a metronome, aligning to a faint seam only sound could read. <words>223</words>
I pressed and a panel breathed open, coughing dust that smelled of damp manuscripts and lunar soil, the perfume of elders who had practiced silence as architecture. <words>250</words>
I stepped inside and chalked the darkness, mapping forgotten tunnels with measured strokes, each line a promise to return what law never learned to safeguard. <words>275</words>
People call me a smuggler because I carry orphaned routes across regimes, but blameless because I move only what keeps neighbors neighboring, nothing that fattens cannons. <words>301</words>
Behind me the countdown echoed through pipes, a clock drumming like an approaching parade, urging my pencil to quicken where stone buckled into dangerous confessions. <words>326</words>
At a turn I found a child's shoe, laced with dust, and the necklace warmed, as if the lost urchin pulled my sleeve toward a passage misnamed by fear. <words>355</words>
I traced the final artery to daylight, then returned to the gallery, whispering a map that rippled across the dome, not as triumph but as enough. <words>381</words>
When the charges sang, the engineers did overreach, and yet the tunnels I mapped breathed out new courtyards where jasmine returned, teaching the city to survive itself. <words>408</words>
I took no credit, only responsibility, the logically emotional posture of one who knows that mercy must be audited if it hopes to appear again on schedule. <words>435</words>
In that whispering gallery, during the final countdown and after it, I remained the blameless smuggler, custodian of routes, and humble student of the art of survival. <words>462</words>
