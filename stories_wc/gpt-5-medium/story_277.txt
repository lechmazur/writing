I arrived at the giant's workshop with an empty coin purse and an overflowing index of doubts. <words>17</words>
They called me an unsure archivist, a keeper of drafts and dust, but I preferred to be a gardener of embers. <words>38</words>
My commission, whispered throughout the golden age, was to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners of memory and make them visible. <words>60</words>
Every beam, gear, and chisel loomed like continents, and the air trembled with the fractured beauty of measured thunder. <words>79</words>
Giant apprentices, voices slow as anvils dropping, watched while I mapped the floor's chalked spirals, precisely playful swirls that promised order if I listened. <words>103</words>
Broken precedents were everywhere: tools shaped like riddles, contracts written backward, and history catalogued by smells instead of dates. <words>122</words>
I recognized a code the giants had left for anyone small enough to kneel, a message that could only unmask itself through the pattern of a labyrinth's path. <words>150</words>
I set my empty coin purse like a compass at the entrance to the chalk maze and waited for the drafts to move it. <words>174</words>
When it drifted, I followed, translating each curl of chalk into a question, and each answer into a door the giants had forgotten they built. <words>199</words>
The path passed furnaces that slept like lions, vats of lacquer reflecting night skies, and scaffolds webbed with thread as strong as temper. <words>222</words>
At each crossroads I paused, precisely playful, tapping a rivet to hear whether it rang like Yes or sulked like No. <words>243</words>
The apprentices leaned in, giant shadows knitting me into their loom, as I read their elders' intentions: to build machines that could remember kindness. <words>267</words>
Yet those machines had stalled because precedent demanded tallying profits, and the tally had crushed the sparks I sought to cultivate. <words>288</words>
I unrolled a vellum of forbidden indexes, my hands shaking, and suggested we draft new ledgers from the maze itself, honoring broken precedents as bright detours. <words>314</words>
The giants listened, then lit the furnaces with the coin purse as sacrifice, not for money, but for space within the fire to look inward. <words>339</words>
Flames scaled the rafters and revealed frescoes only predictable to the brave, scenes of apprentices guiding elders, and my timid notes blooming into luminous indexes. <words>364</words>
I felt the unsure archivist in me unmask another self, not certain but committed, a curator of hope with soot-brushed sleeves and labyrinth-drawn footsteps. <words>388</words>
Together we rewrote the workshop's charter in ringed patterns, so any wandering apprentice could read direction by kneeling and listening to the gears breathe. <words>412</words>
Thus, throughout the golden age, the giant's workshop unmasked itself as a school, and our precisely playful maps kept cultivating light in the unlit corners. <words>437</words>
