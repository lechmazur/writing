<story>I am a small-town baker with a cynically gentle smile, kneading dawn into loaves while listening for the click of the emergency time machine garage next door. <words>27</words>
Its doors rattle whenever the town remembers our timeframe, when shadows learn to speak and the night gives instructions like a seasoned aunt. <words>50</words>
Lately, the shadows have been gossiping about a tyrant who taxes breath and measures love, and my whisking hands keep still only by counting their whispers. <words>76</words>
They tell me to exceed the ordinary courage of bakers, to trade flour for reckoning, and to aim my soft cynicism like a blade of kindness. <words>102</words>
So I enter the garage at moonrise, where cracked consoles smell faintly of ozone and old ginger, and blueprints are pressed flowers of time pinned beneath sober glass. <words>130</words>
I was never an engineer, but dough teaches patience, and patience translates into knobs, levers, passwords, and the humble art of listening. <words>152</words>
The manual, brittle as crust, insists that time flows best by tracking moon patterns, because the sea of seconds rises to lunar pulls like unsalted bread to warmth. <words>180</words>
I chalk crescents and gibbous arches over the dashboard, each phase a doorway, each doorway a recipe, each recipe a promise to dethrone a tyrant. <words>205</words>
If I could return to the day the first decree germinated, I might pluck out the seeds of contagion he buried in parades, slogans, and ration cards. <words>232</words>
Those seeds do not merely sicken bodies; they lull spines, dull eyes, and teach neighbors to fear the warmth of their own ovens. <words>255</words>
I collect evidence in a flour tin, where tiny envelopes hold pressed flowers from years the air tasted honest, proof that beauty once pollinated public laughter. <words>281</words>
I speak to the shadows that roost on the rafters, asking which night would unmake the throne without unmaking the people who once lifted it. <words>306</words>
They answer in syllables like wind through wheat, saying the tyrant was a boy who traded lullabies for brass, and that his spine still hears the old tune. <words>334</words>
I program the machine for that birthday dusk, when a paper lantern drifted, and the town gathered near the millpond, and the sky cracked open like an egg of velvet. <words>364</words>
Carrying my tin of proofs and a basket of warm rolls, I step inside the humming ribs, my cynically gentle heart beating recipes into fate. <words>389</words>
The jump lands me in a quieter century, the mystical reality of rivers that speak only in moonlight, and a village unafraid to be tender. <words>414</words>
I find the boy who will be king, his cheek inked with soot from the lantern, and I exceed his defenses by offering bread that smells like forgiveness. <words>442</words>
While he eats, I stitch those pressed flowers into the lantern's torn side, and every petal glows with a memory of feasts where nobody was measured. <words>468</words>
Shadows gather around us, eager students, and I whisper into them the recipe that will replace the seeds of contagion with seeds of listening. <words>492</words>
Then the garage door finally rests, listening too. <words>500</words></story>
