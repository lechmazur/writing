After the orchard gate closes on harvest day, I lock the miniature world museum and start my quiet rounds. <words>19</words>
They call me the stoic steward, which is fair, though my calm is less stone than practiced patience. <words>37</words>
Tonight the dollhouse town smells faintly of apples and dust, a cynical warmth I have come to trust. <words>55</words>
I wear my wearable bird skull cameo beneath the collar, its tiny beak tapping my pulse like a metronome. <words>74</words>
The piece is honestly rare, carved from pearly bone rescued from a barn owl that lived out its days over our fields. <words>96</words>
I venerate small survivals like that, not with prayers, but with placement and care. <words>110</words>
Each exhibit is a perfect facade until the visitor breathes, and then the cracks in the facade show themselves like shy rivers. <words>132</words>
I was hired to polish away such seepage, but I have learned to guide it instead, to defy the lullaby of conformity. <words>154</words>
The board believes acquisitions arrive on tidy bills, yet I arrange our better miracles via encrypted shipping labels. <words>172</words>
A donor in Ruzinov becomes simply RZV, a sculptor near the estuary becomes EST, and their parcels appear as mundane maintenance. <words>193</words>
Inside, I find landscapes that refuse obedience, miniature laundries where shirts dry in the rain, model schools with windows slightly ajar. <words>214</words>
Tonight a shipment brings a clock tower with a bent bell and a tiny protest banner, stitched from thread and bravado. <words>235</words>
I place it in the plaza scene where the mayor forever waves, and I angle the lamplight to catch every dented truth. <words>257</words>
If anyone asks, the label will say seasonal repair, but the children will see the message before the adults translate the alibi. <words>279</words>
My face gives little away, yet the cameo taps faster when I imagine their eyes widening like shutters thrown open. <words>299</words>
The orchard wind hums outside, that good tired song fruit trees sing, but it never drowns the whispering towns within the glass. <words>321</words>
I make one last circuit and pause at the farmhouse diorama, where the painted family eats without speaking. <words>339</words>
A hairline crack runs through their dining room wall, a line I refused to seal because it tells the truth. <words>359</words>
One day the board will demand an audit, and I will smile like a locked drawer, useful and unread. <words>378</words>
Until then, I catalog our disobedient wonders with clinical ink, and I file their paths in my head like a secret rail map. <words>401</words>
The work is simple, which is to say relentless, and the reward is the moment when a visitor feels their own crack begin. <words>424</words>
They will not thank me, and I will not ask, because gratitude would turn it into a lesson and I prefer an awakening. <words>447</words>
After the lights dim, I touch the tiny skull, honor its former flight, and promise to keep opening these small skies. <words>468</words>
Morning will call me steward again, but under the title lives a patient saboteur, smiling with honestly rare kindness. <words>487</words>
