<story>Before recorded history, I worked beneath lava-light in a root system mapping facility, a quietly humming catacomb for living cartographers. <words>20</words>
They called me the quiet matchmaker, because I paired roots with rivers, soils with stars, lovers with the tasks that saved them. <words>42</words>
I was silently talkative; my matches spoke for me across sap, tide, and breath. <words>56</words>
Our oath was to decode natural patterns, the whispers plants cast into soil like constellations buried face-down. <words>73</words>
No tool should have survived that age, yet I learned the forbidden method by rewiring an outdated vr headset we found in a basalt pocket. <words>98</words>
It tuned me to the cycle of rebirth, letting me drift through other lives as if they were tributaries of the same root. <words>121</words>
From one future mouth, a mariner's log book washed back to me, its salt-soft pages swelled with wave counts and wind scars. <words>143</words>
I held it in the visor's ghostlight and mapped root pulses against tide notations, matching droughts to doldrums, blooms to monsoons. <words>164</words>
The elders warned that such crossings would jeopardize the balance, that hearing time breathe would teach me to stop it. <words>184</words>
I proceeded anyway, because painful joy is truer than painless ignorance, and love is a pattern that begs to be solved. <words>205</words>
Through the rewired visor I paired a seed with the shadow of a future harbor, and two strangers whose breaths rhymed across eras. <words>228</words>
Roots became silently talkative, their capillaries drumming fugues that mapped births, drownings, departures, and the exact hands that would catch returning souls. <words>250</words>
In one passage I was the mariner who wrote the book, steering by fungi constellations bleeding under the waves like anchored auroras. <words>272</words>
I loved someone on shore whose tears salted the roots, and I knew the quiet matchmaker had braided us long before we breathed. <words>295</words>
Back beneath lava-light, the facility trembled as though remembering extinctions, and the elders sealed the doors with ambered resin. <words>314</words>
To spare the equilibrium I had endangered, I offered up the visor, promising to unmake the method that let me cross lifetimes. <words>336</words>
Yet the roots insisted on a different bargain, a ritual allowing me to keep memory so long as I became a living conduit. <words>359</words>
They threaded my veins with feeder hairs and set me standing, not dead, not entirely human, but a trellis for travelers between breaths. <words>382</words>
The mariner's log book became my bark, its entries now rings that sailors of sap can read with tongues of salt and pollen. <words>405</words>
I am still the quiet matchmaker, feeling painful joy as cycles pass through me, decoding natural patterns so no love must be jeopardized again. <words>429</words></story>
