By the time I reached the ancient Japanese castle, the valley below hummed with seed planting and the ghosts of patrol routes I once walked. <words>25</words>
I was a former lawman, burned out and bent toward escape from the cycle of violence that had trained my hands to clench. <words>48</words>
The place sang in corroded rapture, beauty oxidized by wars and winters, a choir of beams and moss exhaling stories through cracked lacquer. <words>71</words>
In my pocket waited vintage spectacles, lenses chipped like old river stones, rescued from evidence storage on my last unslept night. <words>92</words>
They had been wrapped around a misplaced letter that found its way to the wrong address, but the right person: me. <words>113</words>
The letter, blotched with rain and plum ink, asked me to come during planting to help end the feuds cleaving her fields like swords. <words>137</words>
Inside the keep, a widow gardener met me, saying the address had been wrong, yet the spectacles matched her father, and therefore the messenger had known the right soul. <words>166</words>
When I wore them, the courtyard sharpened, and I saw broken pieces everywhere waiting to be gathered: cracked tiles, split trust, harvests severed by flags. <words>191</words>
I proposed a probably improbable plan as we stirred seed in water bowls, to trade the clans a ceremony for their trophies, a yield of peace for steel. <words>219</words>
To escape the cycle of violence, I would have them plant the paddies in mirrored rows, burying one blade at every corner as a marker of forbearance. <words>246</words>
When the elders arrived, I lifted the spectacles and read the scrawl inside the case, a poem the letter had mislaid yet delivered to my conscience. <words>272</words>
It said, Gather the broken pieces, and you will hold the bowl; glaze can be mixed from ash, but courage must be kneaded from breath. <words>297</words>
So I had them stir the mud with bare feet, then press seeds into the swirls, each step smudging a crest, each palm planting an intention. <words>323</words>
A veteran who knew me from red streets watched, jaw ticking, and I told him how every arrest had opened another door to blood, a corroded rapture that never ended. <words>353</words>
I offered myself as collateral, the former lawman to be taken first if the pact shattered, and their silence shifted like crows changing branches. <words>377</words>
Rain fell that night, and by morning the paddies held mirrored skies, blades sleeping under water while a probably improbable truce took root like rice. <words>402</words>
I left the spectacles with the widow and walked out through the gate, gathering broken pieces behind me into something whole enough to live. <words>426</words>
The letter had been misplaced, the address wrong, but it found the right person at the right ruin during planting, and I stepped from violence into tending. <words>453</words>
