Near midnight, I stood inside the abandoned circus tent, listening to rain strum its ragged canvas like a broken harp. <words>20</words>
I was a detached brewer of misfit ales, concoctions that tasted of barns and meteor dust, brewed for ghosts who preferred their memories uncarbonated. <words>44</words>
Business had soured during the transition from analog to digital, when even thirsts were being quantified and archived by humming machines. <words>65</words>
I brewed to fund my exit plan, to escape a dystopian future that smelled like warmed plastic and sounded like obedient applause. <words>87</words>
On a barrel sat a plain photo frame, its glass fogged, holding the last picture of my sister before the state taught her how to disappear. <words>113</words>
She had promised to guide me through coded lullabies in children's songs, little melodies that tucked passwords between do and re like smuggled seeds. <words>137</words>
The string of bulbs along the ring was hauntingly bright, as if bad decisions needed theater lights to feel legitimate. <words>157</words>
I had come to a fateful crossroads: sell my yeast library to the Ministry of Intoxication, or follow her song map into the dark and detach from the ledgered world. <words>187</words>
The tent reeked of rust and sugar, feral elegance clinging to the fibers like perfume on a bruise. <words>205</words>
I tuned the calliope pipes I had salvaged from a carousel, then whistled the first bar of a nursery rhyme my mother forbade. <words>228</words>
The analog pipes coughed, and a set of hidden speakers answered in clipped digital beeps, a harmony like rain learning to speak. <words>250</words>
Within the beeps lay coordinates, a train time, and a phrase to show the conductor, and each clue lit the photo frame until my sister's smile flickered like a lighthouse. <words>280</words>
Outside, the Ministry's vans prowled past, scanners sweeping for unregistered recipes, the future breathing against the canvas with a patient, carnivorous hush. <words>302</words>
I poured my latest batch onto the sawdust, watched it vanish like a trained tiger, then began to detach the copper hoses that bound me to the kettle. <words>330</words>
Detachment had been my shield, but the songs braided courage through it, turning me from a brewer of numbness into a smuggler of futures, guided by that hauntingly bright ring of bulbs. <words>362</words>
I packed the plain photo frame and the calliope reed, then sang the second lullaby, which told me to walk the ring twice, clap thrice, and step where the spotlight faltered. <words>393</words>
The dirt gave, revealing a service hatch, where analog gears kissed digital relays, an old mouth teaching a new tongue how to swallow travelers whole. <words>418</words>
I slid inside as the lullaby finished, and in that hush I chose my path, leaving the ministry, the kettles, and the ledgered world to their tidy hunger. <words>446</words>
When I surfaced beneath the station, the air smelled of ozone and orange peels, and the schedule flickered between paper and pixels like a promise learning to keep itself. <words>475</words>
I boarded, clutching the frame, and let the song carry me into unwritten weather. <words>489</words>
