<story>
I am a solitary birdwatcher employed in the leaf classification office, where silence catalogs everything except breath. <words>17</words>
I keep anxiously relaxed by weaving braided bitterness into patient routines, tying perception to every stem's paper label. <words>35</words>
The building's polished marble floor returns ghostlike reflections of ceiling fans, cabinets, and sometimes the birds I remember. <words>53</words>
In my drawer waits a mask made from shattered porcelain shards, its edges softened by gauze and hours of indecision. <words>73</words>
The mask is not disguise but oath, a way to assert cosmic chaos as a birthright without breaking anything. <words>92</words>
During a cosmic blink, long enough for a scrap of light to consider doubt, my office receives an unmarked specimen. <words>112</words>
It looks like a leaf but whispers feather, its veins arrowed like migrating flocks, its margin bristling with intent. <words>131</words>
When I tilt it, the ghostlike reflections on the polished marble floor draw maps across the room's gray brightness. <words>150</words>
I remember the power of nonviolence taught by birdsong, how sparrows negotiate space without claws, and I promise restraint. <words>169</words>
I kilter my breath and strap on the porcelain mask, letting its fractures align my scattered attention into facets. <words>188</words>
Through the jagged eyeholes the specimen becomes a parliament of silhouettes, each leaf a feather, each feather a question. <words>207</words>
I test them through ghostlike reflections on the polished marble floor, reading answers as ripples that reorganize the air. <words>226</words>
The office, usually serene, slides slightly off its kilter as labels curl and categories loosen like autumn's earliest shrug. <words>245</words>
I stay anxiously relaxed, neither forcing meaning nor fleeing, waiting for the world to decide which grammar it prefers. <words>264</words>
From the floor a whisper gathers, declaring that naming is violence unless listening is first, and my spine listens. <words>283</words>
So I lower my tweezers, open palms upward, and let the specimen hover between jurisdictions without confiscation or command. <words>302</words>
The mask's shards catch stray sun, projecting small theatres where protests disperse gently, where crows arbitrate disputes with patient angles. <words>322</words>
I speak softly to the mirrors underfoot, asserting cosmic chaos as a birthright, not a threat, but a lineage. <words>341</words>
The feather leaf lightens, settles, and the office returns to kilter, cabinets remembered, silence restored, breath threaded with wonder. <words>360</words>
Yet braided bitterness remains, not rancor, but the dark fiber that keeps tenderness from tearing when classifications dissolve. <words>378</words>
I file the specimen as unfiled, sign with the porcelain mask's silhouette, and authorize future listening as method and law. <words>398</words>
Outside, during a cosmic blink only I can feel, every leaf sighs yes without surrendering its shape. <words>415</words>
