<story>I was a former game show host stranded on a desert island, and the applause in my skull refused to die. <words>21</words>
Even here, I practiced patter in a bitter honey tone, sweetened by hope and stung by memory. <words>38</words>
My podium was a driftwood stump inside an insect symphony hall, a grotto where beetles scraped bows across their wings. <words>58</words>
Each night I announced moonrise to the audience of clicking thoraxes, strangely always expecting a car to be won. <words>77</words>
Instead, the prize was a fortune-teller's crystal ball I found washed ashore, cloudy as conch milk. <words>93</words>
It showed not futures but the insides of sound, waves folding like linen, audience replacing host with a gentle overturn. <words>113</words>
I needed answers, because rumor said this island hid a library of living coral tablets, and I was here to rescue sacred knowledge. <words>136</words>
The rumor arrived with the same network that fired me, a sabotage whispered as concern about ratings and storms. <words>155</words>
It was better to strand the host than let him reveal what he should never have known. <words>172</words>
I learned what they feared when the old typewriter's keys finally go silent in the caves, and the air stiffened. <words>192</words>
Behind the cave wall, a secretary crab tapped history into living rock, then fell still as if a show had wrapped. <words>213</words>
A sudden illness leads to meeting a helpful stranger, and mine came as fever that turned the surf into blue confetti. <words>234</words>
He stepped from the palms carrying bitter herbs, wearing a tie etched with tides, and spoke like an offstage announcer. <words>254</words>
Call me Mentor, he said without letters, because the typewriter stopped and the insects have taken the orchestra pit. <words>273</words>
He taught me to listen to the crystal ball, which hummed with frequencies the beetles tuned like tiny conductors. <words>292</words>
Within its globe I saw the library buried under tidal silt, guarded by codes in wingbeats only a host could translate. <words>313</words>
My training returned, the cue cards of memory bleeding through, and I asked the right questions while beetles answered in arpeggios. <words>334</words>
Mentor guided me to the reef, where we lifted tablets like contestants draw curtains, careful to keep the turnover gentle. <words>354</words>
The crystal confirmed a gentle overturn of power, not a coup but a tilt toward listening, away from manufactured thunder. <words>374</words>
We etched the code back into coral with careful taps, reviving the secretary crab and the orchestra rose in applause. <words>394</words>
I was no longer stranded, only sworn. <words>401</words></story>
