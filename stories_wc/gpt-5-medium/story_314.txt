On double shift again, I, the overworked policy enforcer of our polished utopia, monitored the kelp forest observation post and laughed through tears. <words>23</words>
Even tranquility demanded paperwork, and the sea kept handing me forms no clam could sign, so I kept inventing pens from patience. <words>45</words>
My desk held a rustic bread box repurposed as a contraband archive, its wood salted by years of fog and unconfessed snacks. <words>67</words>
Most reports involved bioluminescent pranks I labeled genuinely fake, until the perimeter bells trembled like gulls that suddenly translated fear into grammar. <words>89</words>
From the kelp rose a figure stitched from moonlight and silt, and I realized my shift now involved facing the supernatural. <words>110</words>
The visitor spoke with laughing tears, every ripple a giggle, every echo a sob, and I felt promoted beyond any printed badge. <words>132</words>
It said it arrives only at the exact second a promise is sworn within earshot of kelp that remember names. <words>152</words>
I had promised, earlier, to greet fear as a necessary teacher, right after denying my exhaustion a vacation and right before the alarms sang. <words>176</words>
The figure asked me to guide it to the bread box, beating its request with the rhythm of a drum in a tribal dance. <words>200</words>
Inside lay confiscated keepsakes, every item attached to a policy citation, every citation secretly attached to a wish someone had sworn to abandon. <words>223</words>
The figure confessed it was our utopia's abandoned promise, a genuinely fake guardian made real by the tidal interest we accrued in our denials. <words>247</words>
I laughed until the tears tasted like salt code, and then I cried until the laughter spelled my name across the window. <words>269</words>
It asked for one lawful thing: witness me choosing between perfect order and living truth, right now, because the second hand already pointed like a spear. <words>295</words>
I opened the bread box and guided its hands to a slip tagged Night Swimming, a fine I once wrote against the tide for climbing the moon. <words>322</words>
At the exact second a promise is sworn, the slip curled like a leaf relieved of pretending, and the observation windows filled with ancestral shadows. <words>347</words>
They did not threaten; they taught, and my fear greeted them like a head bowed to the surf, a necessary teacher taking attendance with foam. <words>372</words>
The promise being guided me around the room with the rhythm of a drum in a tribal dance, and every circuit loosened a law that hurt. <words>398</words>
By dawn, I sealed new policies inside the rustic bread box, laughing tears as I signed, ready to guide without pretending. <words>419</words>
