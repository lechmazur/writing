<story>Twilight poured like diluted ink over the twilight viaduct in bloom, and I unfolded my camera obscura as if setting a lantern inside the heart of a cloud. [28]
Everything was softened, edged but tender, a foggy lucidity that made the bridge seem awake and listening. [45]
I came here because, after the past life memory surfaces, breath carries different music, and I needed to hear what the stone held in its pauses. [71]
In my memory I was a maker of mirrors who forgot to love anyone but the light, and it left me with shelves of unused hours. [97]
I am spiritually curious, which is another way of saying I cannot stop asking where the remainder goes when a feeling is not spent. [121]
To find where unused love is stored, I became a camera obscura artist, carrying boxes that swallow scenes and give them back as interior weather. [146]
Tonight my pocket holds kwan yin's tear, a little vial of rainwater I collected beneath a shrine roof that dripped only when prayers felt heavy. [171]
I am told the bodhisattva listens, and the tear listens with her, bright as a pause before a yes. [190]
I set the dark box on a parapet where vines had flowered in improbable constellations, white blooms mapping the curve like shy comets finding orbit. [215]
If I aim and wait, the world enters and reverses, and in the small aperture I can watch it breathe. [235]
The image arrives revealing through breathing changes, tides of shadow advancing and receding until outlines remember what they are supposed to be. [257]
I exhale and the arches thicken; I inhale and the river grows ribs of light. [272]
My hands learn this conversation the way a pilgrim learns the road, step by glowing step, a pilgrim of sparks walking inside the lens. [296]
But I am not only collecting pictures; I am hunting the pantry where the heart stashes surplus sweetness when no one is home to taste it. [322]
The viaduct hums with former footsteps, and the flowers lean in like listeners who long ago finished their sentences but remained to hear the answer anyway. [348]
I dab a drop from kwan yin's tear onto my tongue, a clear taste like rain stitched with bell tones too small to ring out loud. [374]
The change is gentle, but the breath reveals heat where a memory tries to hide, and I follow it the way moss follows a seep. [399]
The past life comes forward like a reversed negative, a woman inside a glass room, tracing sunlit edges yet refusing to turn toward the voices in the street. [427]
She is me; she is the one who measured light but never let it touch, the keeper of brightness who mistook counting for giving. [451]
I speak to her by changing my breath, and the box shifts its tones, as if the river has learned a new mouth and wants to practice vowels. [479]
I say: let us heal what we hoarded, and the arches loosen, and the blooms let down a little pollen like golden reasons. [502]
Unused love, I learn, is stored wherever we resist the exhale, in attic lungs, in held breath, in the corners of rooms where chairs stand without coats. [529]
So I begin a practice at the viaduct in bloom, sending out the portions I never spent, one breath outward, one breath listened for. [553]
Each exhale writes a translucent letter on the inner wall of the camera, and the river reads them as if they were meant for its far estuary. [580]
Each inhale receives an answer that is not words yet instructs my bones to open a window I did not know I had locked. [604]
Around me, lamps blossom along the path, and their light rests on my shoulders, patient as hands in a room where someone finally asks for help. [630]
The woman in the glass turns toward the street, and the glass itself becomes a door, and I feel a storage closet unlatch behind my ribs. [656]
I do not spill or drown; I decant, and the world adjusts to the new river by giving me room to place the emptied jars. [681]
A man crossing the arches pauses, and I see that his eyes mirror the sky, and his breaths tremble like fledglings deciding to fly. [705]
He asks what I am doing, and I answer without turning that I am sending love to the places that kept it safe too long. [730]
He nods as if I have named his unnamed ache, and he stands beside me, our chests finding the same tide until the bridge hums like a tuning fork. [759]
When he goes on, he leaves behind a breath rhythm, and I keep it, not as possession but as a trail marker the future may follow back. [786]
Night finishes the lesson; I pack the box, feeling the viaduct breathe easier. [799]</story>
