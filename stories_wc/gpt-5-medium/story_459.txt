On my union badge it says elevator repair technician, but ghosts are the ones who flag me down between floors and years. <words>22</words>
At noon I slip into the sand castle preservation lab, where crenellated sculptures slump under lamps and the air hums like a seashell. <words>45</words>
I keep the elevators quiet for the museum, and the dead quiet for myself, a complex simplicity that feels almost honest. <words>66</words>
During maintenance forms and timid coffee, I notice a dried flower crown tucked between sand sieves like an abandoned halo. <words>86</words>
It crumbles when I lift it, my hands elegantly clumsy from years of cables, pulleys, and conversations with people who are not alive. <words>109</words>
Their whispers gather in the quiet machinery, a dissonance of silence that rattles the bolts harder than any misaligned car. <words>129</words>
I want to find liberation in letting go, but first I must learn which cable I am clinging to. <words>148</words>
So I dissect our failures amid lunch breaks, prying apart the way a voice sticks to a stairwell or a gaze knots a lanyard. <words>172</words>
The tours roll by the viewing window, and I collect data by staking out local ghost tours, charting sighs like tide tables. <words>194</words>
A girl points at a plastic shovel and says a prince is buried there, and a gray prince nods behind her, embarrassed. <words>216</words>
He follows me to the freight lift, where I oil the rails and he remembers the taste of salt on vows he never kept. <words>240</words>
When the bell dings, the lab wants a diagnosis for a collapsing turret, but the prince wants a blessing to crumble. <words>261</words>
I set the dried flower crown on the softest dune, and the whispering quiet shifts, like shoes finding the middle of a step. <words>284</words>
The prince fades without ceremony, and I log a note about moisture, load distribution, and how release can be a maintenance schedule. <words>306</words>
In the break room I practice silence, letting its dissonance ring until it turns into a map I can ride like an elevator. <words>329</words>
Each floor marks a different letting go, and my elegantly clumsy heart learns to accept the scraped shin of mercy. <words>349</words>
I revisit the turret and adjust the lights, making the sand glow with patient authority, while the absence of a crown teaches what remains. <words>373</words>
By afternoon, the tours thin, the ghosts yawn, and I file the flower fragments, labeling this tender collapse as structural, not spiritual. <words>395</words>
I am still afraid of stairs that stop, cables that sing, and promises that tighten, but fear is a tool like any wrench. <words>418</words>
The museum closes, the sea machine winds down, and the lab breathes, and I breathe with it, a technician crossing into evening. <words>440</words>
Outside, waves erase plans drafted in footprints, and I finally let the elevator doors open to whatever floor the world requests. <words>461</words>
Somewhere a bell rings without a finger, a simple sound made complex by the quiet around it, and I step through, lighter. <words>483</words>
