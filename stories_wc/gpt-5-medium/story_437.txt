The sprawling greenhouse city under a toxic sky kept raining like a soft apology. <words>14</words>
Amid rain showers, my congregation shuffled between glass corridors, seeking warmth in fogged halos. <words>28</words>
I was their spineless cult leader, a reed of a man bending to every draft of belief. <words>45</words>
They imagined I could influence the seasons, but I only memorized schedules of vents and misters. <words>61</words>
I longed to understand the language of flowers, and so I learned to listen where stems sighed. <words>78</words>
The boundaries between listening and leading began blurring boundaries, like condensation erasing the pane's certainties. <words>93</words>
In my office, a ceramic owl figurine perched above mildew ledges, pretending to keep watch. <words>108</words>
Its blank eyes made courage seem statically dynamic, never moving yet always measuring me. <words>122</words>
When recruits wavered, I tried to influence via the faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs. <words>139</words>
I would tilt those frames toward the greenhouse lights until the sorrow glittered like an invitation. <words>155</words>
They mistook memory for prophecy, and I accepted their mistake with doleful cheer. <words>168</words>
To keep them close, I charted bloom cycles as if they were horoscopes, binding hope to petals. <words>185</words>
Still, the rain drummed, and toxins ribboned the clouds, and every pane hummed with distant warnings. <words>201</words>
The city grew more hothouse than home, our footsteps soft in compost that remembered forests. <words>216</words>
One evening, a child asked why the owl never blinked, and I heard the question folding the air. <words>234</words>
Because it is our god, I could have said, but my tongue felt like paper in rain. <words>251</words>
Instead I told the truth: the owl is clay, and I am clay, and we survive by arrangement. <words>269</words>
Arrangement meant swapping courage for consensus, and consensus meant keeping the vents singing their mechanical lullabies. <words>285</words>
Yet the flowers had their own grammar, accents rising when rain struck, meanings curling as leaves closed. <words>302</words>
I leaned close to an ailing violet, and its violet silence felt louder than prayer. <words>317</words>
It taught me by not teaching, and my leadership, such as it was, cracked like an overwatered pot. <words>335</words>
I gathered the congregation and placed the owl figurine among the damp begonias, where anxiety smelled like sugar. <words>353</words>
Let us retire from certainty, I said, and learn the sentences of scent, the syntax of patience. <words>370</words>
Amid rain showers, they listened as I recited petal shapes like vowels, and sepals like consonants. <words>386</words>
Our grief brightened, a doleful cheer, because the orchids translated our apologies into thirsts we could quench. <words>403</words>
The boundaries blurred again, but now between leaders and listeners, between worship and work, between survival and song. <words>421</words>
I told them the owl would never blink, so we would do it for it, taking turns to watch the rain. <words>442</words>
Each watch ended with photographs tilted toward light, the tears no longer a trick, just an honest influence. <words>460</words>
And the flowers replied in syllables of opening, a statically dynamic choir holding our fragile future together. <words>477</words>
