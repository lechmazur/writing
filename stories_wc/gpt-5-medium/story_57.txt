The daisies pretended innocence while rakes scraped a steady metronome amid yard work behind the secret agent workshop. <words>18</words>
I, a submissive aristocrat mislaid by history, trimmed hedges and avoided eye contact with the knives that wanted assignments. <words>37</words>
My specialty was silent empathy, which here functioned like contraband, useful but liable to be confiscated by louder tools. <words>56</words>
They paid me to sweep, not to feel, yet feeling made me unusually perceptive about who might break and who merely creaked. <words>78</words>
I kept a dull letter opener tucked in my sleeve, mascot of harmlessness, a blade so meek it bowed to envelopes. <words>99</words>
The hedges whispered when the ventilation ducts awakened, those aluminum throats that turned halls into echo chambers. <words>116</words>
Through unplanned eavesdropping in echo chambers, I caught the plan to liquify whatever had been spirited into Box Seven. <words>135</words>
The voices belonged to managers who admired cruelty the way some admire modernist chairs, with posture and meaningless adjectives. <words>154</words>
They joked in earnest flippancy about viscosity, suggesting a creature would travel faster once turned convenient. <words>170</words>
To protect a vulnerable creature, I needed both stealth and nerve, two jackets I wore badly but refused to hang up. <words>191</words>
Box Seven rested near the workshop drain, where leaks practiced escape artistry and floor soap remembered oceans. <words>208</words>
I knelt with pruning shears as cover, smiling at a beetle supervisor, and slid the dull letter opener under the latch. <words>229</words>
Inside, a trembling fox kit glared at captivity with more nobility than my entire family portrait ever managed. <words>247</words>
Its silence was a mirror, and in it I watched my own bent spine bow without surrender. <words>264</words>
From the ducts came another gust of gossip, instructing the plumbing crew to open valves and liquify evidence at three seventeen. <words>285</words>
I should have fetched a permit, or a spine, but instead I fetched a mop bucket like a footman with delusions of mutiny. <words>308</words>
I poured in the sugar agents kept for coffee and the sand they kept for traction, a grit that would refuse to liquify. <words>331</words>
I traded bows with the cameras, then knocked the drain grate loose and sloshed my stubborn mixture into the pipework. <words>351</words>
If viscosity were a monarchy, I declared myself its least rebellious duke, yet the pipes clogged like loyalists. <words>369</words>
Alarms debated decorum, and I picked up the fox, its heartbeat editing my bravado into a more readable draft. <words>388</words>
We slipped through the tool room where disguises hung like unfinished sentences, and I thanked the dull letter opener for its patience. <words>410</words>
Outside, yard workers argued about mulch theology, their rakes composing static that covered our retreat toward the compost gate. <words>429</words>
The beetle supervisor rode my sleeve like a knight, a witness sworn by dirt, while the fox studied the daylight with silent empathy. <words>452</words>
I promised the creature a hedge palace and terrible poetry, and the promise felt like a crown I could carry without shame. <words>474</words>
Behind us, managers shouted orders that bounced through echo chambers and found only the disciplined muddle of my improved drain. <words>494</words>
