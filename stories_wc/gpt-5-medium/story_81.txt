I arrive in the time-dilated zone with a pocketful of questions and a heartbeat that keeps losing the race against light. <words>21</words>
The whispering advisor meets me beside an orchard fence surrendering itself to eras, yet still carrying the perfume of last year's frostbitten blossoms. <words>44</words>
He says the clock here is a soft tide, and that empathy rises like a moon when you breathe slow enough to hear it. <words>68</words>
I am here to understand time patterns, and the admission tastes of rain on copper, half memory, half prediction. <words>87</words>
He presses into my palm a centuries-old coin, its faint indentations mapping storms of barter, longing, and oaths that outlived their owners. <words>109</words>
The method for entry is through faint indentations on a centuries-old coin, and the threshold accepts me like a tide accepts a wayward oar. <words>133</words>
I close my eyes and read the grooves with my thumb as if honoring a braille of currents, and the world tilts, slow and merciful. <words>158</words>
We step beyond minutes into the orchard's hush, while the orchard fence surrenders to rust and the sky keeps changing old photographs. <words>180</words>
The whispering advisor leans close, his breath a silver moss, and tells me to count the fruit that falls upward. <words>200</words>
Each reverse harvest is a lesson in rising empathy, where seeds remember our footsteps and choose to sprout beneath them as an act of trust. <words>225</words>
To keep steady, I carry a piece of driftwood found at the orchard's old well, its grain oddly comforting like a hand I almost recall. <words>250</words>
The advisor explains its rings are calendars for waves, and that all calendars are apologies we make to the wildness of duration. <words>272</words>
I honor the silence by listening to it, and it repays me by letting me overhear tomorrow missing yesterday in advance. <words>293</words>
Nostalgia feels newly minted here, not a chain but a ribbon, a futuristic nostalgia that invites rather than binds. <words>312</words>
Through the coin, I see births overlapping with farewells like transparent leaves, and my pulse learns to slip its own shadow. <words>333</words>
The whispering advisor asks what pattern I seek, and I confess I want a map for choices that will not harm what comes next. <words>357</words>
He answers by pointing at the fence, where rust blossoms slow, saying that patience is the only vehicle that arrives earlier by leaving later. <words>381</words>
Together we plant the coin at the fence line, and I honor whoever lost it by promising to spend my time like water, not like fire. <words>407</words>
The piece of driftwood leans against the post like a quiet standard, and the wind salutes, smelling of apple cores and unmade mistakes. <words>430</words>
When we finally leave the time-dilated zone, I carry forward a ledger written in feelings, proof that rising empathy calculates better futures than fear. <words>454</words>
