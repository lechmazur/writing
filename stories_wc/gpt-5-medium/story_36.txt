In the hush of a barn loft just after sunrise, I am the calm doomsayer of our mechanical valley. <words>19</words>
Below me clanks the steampunk workshop, boilers yawning, belts whispering, gears turning like tame comets leashed to stubborn constellations. <words>38</words>
I keep a battered old skateboard covered in stickers propped against a beam, its wheels pitted like small, patient planets. <words>58</words>
People ask why a prophet rides that relic, and I answer with placid ferocity that balance teaches physics to fear. <words>78</words>
I am faithfully odd, a tinkerer who forecasts endings the way a machinist reads tolerances, measuring tomorrow with calipers of memory. <words>99</words>
The children used to clatter up the ladder, ask for rides, and laugh when sparks flew like carnival snow. <words>118</words>
They do not come now, and that is the loss of innocence I catalog in brass plates and soot. <words>137</words>
Somewhere past the ridge, a distant train whistle unspools, and it is through the sound of a distant train whistle that my omens speak. <words>161</words>
Each note is a blueprint, each echo a rivet, tapping the skin of morning until the workshop breathes like a lung. <words>182</words>
I descend, lift the skateboard, and resume my ritual: roll the length of the rafters, test the floorboards, gauge the trembling of the beams. <words>206</words>
Sometimes prophecy is balance kept one risky inch at a time, and the gods of stagnation hate momentum. <words>224</words>
To slam a door on the gods of stagnation, you must first locate the hinges they rust, the faces they freeze. <words>245</words>
Here the hinge is the town's forgetting, the way the children trade sparks for screens and call it growing up. <words>265</words>
So I build a clock that refuses to end, a device that reopens afternoons, not to trap time but to unshackle daring. <words>287</words>
Its casing is stitched from boilerplate and prayer, its hands from skateshafts and sighs, its chime tuned to whistle and birdsong. <words>308</words>
When it strikes, the workshop will open like a pupil, and courage will feel ordinary again, as rain feels ordinary. <words>328</words>
If I fall, the loft will catch me, because wood remembers the reckless with a tenderness even gods envy. <words>347</words>
If I fly, the children might hear, through the sound of a distant train whistle, that daring still has parents. <words>367</words>
I push off, and the skateboard, battered and stickered with extinct amusement parks and sun-bleached bands, hums like a memory generator. <words>388</words>
I taste brass and apple dust, I listen for weak planks, and I whisper a weather report for the heart. <words>408</words>
Outside, smoke braids the light, and the valley pretends it is still early enough to choose what to become. <words>427</words>
I do not warn anymore; I invite, and the invitation is a door swung hard toward motion, slamming shut behind regret. <words>448</words>
Gears purr approval, rivets soften, and the whistle miles away threads my ear like a needle that sews courage into silence. <words>469</words>
When the train finally appears, small as a beetle on the horizon, our clock will resume, and so will we. <words>489</words>
