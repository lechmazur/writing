I arrived at the paper airplane test facility before sunrise, as always, never tardy even when the wind dragged its feet. <words>21</words>
Volunteering here throughout the harvest off-season felt perverse, but my orchards would not mind if I seduced aerodynamics. <words>39</words>
The hangar reeked of glue, graphite, and old victories pinned to bulletin boards like butterflies pretending to be useful. <words>58</words>
I was a vigilant orchardist by trade, trained to read blight in leaves the way gamblers read loaded dice. <words>77</words>
That same scrutiny now fed a different hunger, to overcome a personal tragedy that began with a letter and ended with silence. <words>99</words>
My brother crashed a paper plane contest and then crashed his car, leaving me doubts folded tighter than any wing. <words>119</words>
He left an antique letter seal in my coat pocket, its worn griffin crest pressed with a smear of wax and rain. <words>141</words>
I suspected the seal belonged to the facility's director, a peacock of a man who measured genius with stopwatches and grudges. <words>162</words>
During safety demonstrations I would demonstrate, with sardonic glee, how drag bows to craft, and watch his smile falter like wet paper. <words>184</words>
He dismissed my volunteering as quaint, but he was never tardy to the test pit when rumors gathered like pigeons. <words>204</words>
Rumors are seeds to me, and I know which winds carry rot, which worms tunnel the fruit without showing bite marks. <words>225</words>
In the observation bay, the interns released flocks of paper gliders painted with iridescent dots, tracing data via the patterns in a peacock's tail. <words>249</words>
Those dots were no mere flourish; they encoded flight histories, steering algorithms, supplier routes, even the names of donors who preferred curtains. <words>271</words>
I mapped the constellations of color to shipping schedules and wax orders, then matched the griffin seal to invoices that sidestepped audits. <words>293</words>
Each breakthrough arrived like the click of pruners, clean and final, and still I smiled because fury deserved fertilizer. <words>312</words>
The director preened through briefings, unfurling a silk tie speckled like an ocellus, forgetting I spent decades learning the grammar of leaves. <words>334</words>
Leaves taught me that repetition hides disease, and the peacock patterns taught me his planes repeated routes too lucrative to be legal. <words>356</words>
Smuggling parts, laundering donations, burying accidents under trophies, it was all there, fluttering under ultraviolet lamps like moths pretending heaven. <words>376</words>
I confronted him not with accusations but with a demonstration, launching a marked glider whose trail spelled his initials in damning arcs. <words>398</words>
When it landed, I pressed the antique seal into fresh wax on the logbook, and several interns quietly closed the hangar door. <words>420</words>
He laughed, but I laughed harder, because conspiracies unravel best when they realize they have already performed their encore. <words>439</words>
Throughout volunteering, I had patiently pruned lies, and now I harvested answers, tart and restorative, to finally feed the emptiness my brother left. <words>462</words>
Security took him, while the gliders ticked on their strings like distant rain, and I felt spring pruning arrive early in my lungs. <words>485</words>
