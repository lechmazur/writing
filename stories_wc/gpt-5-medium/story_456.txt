The floating rock dojo drifted like a calm seed on the night wind, anchored by ropes of prayer and training scars. <words>21</words>
I, a morbid florist who arranged funerals as if they were tournaments, swept petals from the tatami and listened for teachings. <words>42</words>
My sensei called me boldly timid, a student whose hands never shook yet whose eyes hesitated before beauty or blood. <words>62</words>
A plain white candle guttered beside the oldest lantern, and I knew the truth would arrive in the last flicker of a guttering lantern. <words>86</words>
I had come to this suspended school to understand cosmic cycles, arranging stems as planetary orbits and pruning as eclipses. <words>106</words>
Sensei said my tempered beliefs would keep me from breaking, that balanced heat lets iron sing instead of snap. <words>125</words>
So I trained neutrally passionate, neither ablaze nor cold, letting sorrow and joy pass through like rivers that refuse to drown the stones. <words>148</words>
Tonight, the dojo consulted its archive through the backlog of typed pages in a writer's trunk, mapping kata to constellations and footwork to funerary garlands. <words>173</words>
Sensei asked me to oblige the dead writer by finishing a sequence left incomplete, an arrangement that promised to bridge breath and vacuum. <words>196</words>
The rocks creaked against their chains, and below us the night rumbled with continents grinding like molars in a thoughtful skull. <words>217</words>
I thumbed the cold pages, typed letters marching like pallbearers, and found diagrams of bouquets shaped like tidal graphs and spine sutras. <words>239</words>
The sequence began with bellflowers for beginnings, ended with stonecrop for endings, and demanded a middle made of breath, pause, and restart. <words>261</words>
I worked quickly, boldly timid, threading wire through stems while the plain white candle spat its tiny stars at the shivering dark. <words>283</words>
Every loop of green became a ringed planet, every cut a comet, and I felt the dojo tilt as if space itself were leaning closer. <words>308</words>
My hands were funerals and births at once, neutrally passionate instruments shaping grief into orbits that did not collapse. <words>327</words>
Then, in the last flicker of a guttering lantern, the bouquet clicked into balance, and the chains of the floating rock dojo fell still. <words>351</words>
The pages whispered shut, and the trunk sighed, and I understood that tempered beliefs are not lukewarm, but steel cooled to hold an edge forever. <words>376</words>
Sensei bowed, conceding that the writer's kata had been completed through me, yet warned that tomorrow I must oblige the living as carefully as the dead. <words>402</words>
I blew out the plain white candle and watched its fading smoke braid with the bouquet, a small galaxy unspooling and recoiling in the mind. <words>427</words>
Leaving the mat, I kept the sequence in my pulse to understand cosmic cycles, and stepped into the night with a quiet, serviceable awe. <words>451</words>
