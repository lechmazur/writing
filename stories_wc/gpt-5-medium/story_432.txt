I taste poison for a living, and I do it with a death wish that refuses to die before I do. <words>21</words>
That paradox trained my tongue to read not just alkaloids, but the currents humming beneath people, rooms, and rain. <words>40</words>
Tonight the assignment led me beneath the city, where a subterranean waterfall stitched silver threads through the grotto. <words>58</words>
The waterfall's hush was strangely compelling, like a calm hand guiding a tremor. <words>71</words>
Around me, a hidden society gathered with the patience of stalactites, faces lamp-lit and intent. <words>86</words>
They believed I could map energy flows that pulsed through stone, blood, and rumor, and I believed them because belief is another kind of toxin. <words>111</words>
My method was impure but exacting: by interpreting frantic calls to talk-radio psychics, I graphed patterns the city could not bear to tell me directly. <words>136</words>
The callers were canaries, coughing out dread where the pressure spiked, tracing tributaries of unseen force with their panicked syllables. <words>156</words>
I marked each shock on a simple cloth bookmark, because paper bled in the mist and because I needed something quiet to carry the map against my chest. <words>184</words>
The cloth strands remembered touch, and when I folded them, the lines seemed to bind of their own accord, converging like hands meeting in prayer. <words>209</words>
I knew those hands also poured chalices and tucked daggers, because in this society devotion and danger were siblings sharing an heirloom heartbeat. <words>232</words>
They hired me for the same reason they feared me: my death wish made me immune to the glamour of survival, and I could sip truth to its dregs. <words>261</words>
When the bookmark grew heavy with crossings, I waded into the pool where the subterranean waterfall fell, letting its veil mute my pulse. <words>284</words>
Underwater, light from our lanterns broke like nerves discharging, and in that serene upheaval I felt the city tremble above us. <words>305</words>
An ice sculpture in the council hall, a swan with a blade for a throat, had been positioned over a ballot box for symmetry and threat. <words>331</words>
My graphs had warned it would collapse when the votes tipped the old current, and we had one second to catch the meaning before the shards wrote a different future. <words>361</words>
I lifted the bookmark like a pennant, and the hidden society stood in a ring, breathing with me as if our ribs were a single barrel. <words>387</words>
The waterfall's threads braided through the cloth, and the crossings flared, telling us where the energy flows wanted to be acknowledged instead of denied. <words>411</words>
We bound our whispers to that place, binding the vote to mercy, and I tasted the air for the poison of pride that would resist. <words>436</words>
In the final second before an ice sculpture collapses, you hear it sigh like a tired god, and that was when the waterfall sighed with it. <words>462</words>
Nothing shattered, because the energy had a map, and my death wish lost its footing on the wet stone of purpose. <words>483</words>
I slid the simple cloth bookmark into my pocket and let its warmth bind me to morning. <words>500</words>
