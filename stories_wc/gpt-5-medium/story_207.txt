<story>
On the abandoned space station medical bay, I set down my satchel like a flag of truce. <words>17</words>
I am a forthright peddler whose wares are truths, and my tone is a joyful loneliness learned from long corridors. <words>37</words>
I came to barter for redemption's path, to break an oath sealed in blood and stitched to my quiet name. <words>57</words>
The bay still smells of antiseptic and star-worn dust, machines asleep like monks dreaming of patients who never arrive. <words>76</words>
I carry a dried flower bouquet in a vacuum-wrapped sleeve, a relic from the planet where the oath was sworn. <words>96</words>
Its papery petals rasp against plastic, as if applauding each hesitant step I take while the universe hums its secret song. <words>117</words>
What binds can also guide, I tell myself, meekly assertive in my resolve, a merchant negotiating with his own shadow. <words>137</words>
To find the right buyer for my confession, I divide the station's ghosts into categories: doctors, orderlies, patients, debtors, gods. <words>157</words>
Their names live now only in terminals whose light stutters like uncertain prayer candles. <words>171</words>
I sift the data the way I have always sifted leads, by sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns archived by the station's bored AI. <words>194</words>
It wrote itself society pages for empty wards, wedding notices for sterilizers, obituaries for syringes, and in the margins it left hints. <words>216</words>
A rumor says the head physician hoarded promises, another whispers that spilled plasma signs contracts better than ink, and I listen like a clerk of fate. <words>242</words>
Truth, like credit, must change hands to breathe, so I peddle memories to the silence, and the silence bargains back. <words>262</words>
Payment arrives as a map in dead monitors that flicker corridor by corridor, leading me to a drawer tagged with my family surname. <words>285</words>
Inside waits a record of my oath, a drop of ancestral blood vitrified in crystal, and beside it a receipt for my future. <words>308</words>
Breaking it requires a witness, the columns declare, and the only witness left is me, reflected in a cracked visor like a congregation of one. <words>333</words>
So I speak aloud what I sold and whom I harmed, forthright even to the void, and it answers with a gentle ventilation sigh. <words>357</words>
The bouquet's brittle stems sound like small bones snapping, yet each crack frees a scent of fields, promising that bargains can be unbound. <words>380</words>
I place the flowers over the crystal, rename the receipt as release, and walk out lighter, still lonely, somehow joyfully so, toward newer halls. <words>404</words>
