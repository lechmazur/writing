I am a sincere conjurer with salt on my cuffs and purpose in my pockets. <words>15</words>
I wander a yarn spinning sanctuary built from driftwood, where looms click like patient crickets. <words>30</words>
We work between waves, when the hush after the crash leaves room for threads to remember themselves. <words>47</words>
Our charter is to calm the unstoppable tide of cynicism before it storms the town again. <words>63</words>
Every shawl we spin is a map of tenderness, a rope ladder lowered into rough water. <words>79</words>
Last night, a shared dream connects two strangers across the dunes: myself, and the one who never arrives. <words>97</words>
I woke clutching a torn pocket calendar, its dates smudged like gull prints, its spine bitten by salt. <words>115</words>
Beneath the ashes of an old hearth beside the looms, I hid the calendar, awaiting interpretation. <words>131</words>
Our main loom is dysfunctionally functional, warped by sea air but obedient to stubborn hands and humming songs. <words>149</words>
I rationalize its squeals as a dialect of grief, which the threads can translate into tenderness. <words>165</words>
When the tide retreats, villagers file in, their faces salted with doubt, their pockets empty of mornings. <words>182</words>
They bring stories like knotted skeins, and I untangle them with patient fingers and unabashed listening. <words>198</words>
The sanctuary recognizes them, as if each visitor were once a spindle abandoned in a storm. <words>214</words>
In the dream I keep reentering, the missing stranger speaks through the calendar, whispering numbers like buoy bells. <words>232</words>
Each torn square marks a day when someone forgot how to believe another mouth, another stitch, another dawn. <words>250</words>
I follow the days like constellations, determined wandering that refuses to quit until a thread catches. <words>266</words>
By noon we spin a shawl from storm-gray wool, its edge annotated with tiny knots that count breaths. <words>284</words>
I lift it and ash drifts from the hearth, revealing the calendar half burned, and underneath, a mirror. <words>302</words>
Beneath the ashes, the mirror returns a face I almost know, tide lines at the eyes, unwaved hair. <words>320</words>
A woman enters then, damp from mist, holding her own half of a calendar and the same unease. <words>338</words>
She is the stranger, and the shared dream connects two strangers because we are halves of one promise. <words>356</words>
Her name is Mar, mine Aer, and our syllables row toward each other like boats returning to harbor. <words>374</words>
We place both halves on the loom, and the dysfunctionally functional machine whispers, finally, a rhythm we share. <words>392</words>
Together we rationalize the losses into knots, the hopes into weft, the present into warp that holds. <words>409</words>
The villagers watch as the shawl becomes a tide chart for kindness, rising wherever suspicion would normally recede. <words>427</words>
We gather the scattered ash and card it into the fringe, so that memory becomes softness instead of grit. <words>446</words>
Mar reads the final date aloud, and the bells answer, small, brave, and certain despite the wind. <words>463</words>
Our sanctuary brightens as if dawn found a longer route, and even the sea hushes to listen. <words>480</words>
Between waves, we pass the shawl across the room, and every hand it touches remembers how to trust. <words>498</words>
