I was the small-town librarian who stamped returns, shushed gossip, and cataloged miracles no one else bothered to read. <words>19</words>
So naturally I packed a lunch and went to the portal-strewn canyon riddled with ancient carvings after closing. <words>37</words>
The flyers called it a cursed geology park, but the elders called it a library no one shelved correctly. <words>56</words>
I carried a stolen museum artifact tag because authority never listens unless you wave something with a barcode and audacity. <words>76</words>
The tag had once named an idol, but now it named me, a perfectly flawed custodian looking for a better index. <words>97</words>
Through generations of silent watchers, the canyon had learned to open like a book and laugh at careless readers. <words>116</words>
I admitted my goal with mocking sincerity, the kind that flatters ambition while polishing the knife of consequence. <words>134</words>
I intended to become a legend whispered through time by harvesting grace from every door the carvings hinted toward. <words>153</words>
Grace here was not piety but the supple hinge on which futures swing, a resource the world spends by accident. <words>173</words>
To open the first portal I needed partners, and we found each other through a shared love for a particular type of food. <words>196</words>
Everyone in town craved peppered peach pies, a delicacy the canyon seemed to perfume when the wind wanted company. <words>215</words>
We baked, we traded slices, and we read each crumb like a star chart, agreeing on crusts, exits, and courage. <words>235</words>
The tag clicked against the rock as if scanning worlds, and a seam of daylight grew where only shadow had lived. <words>256</words>
What opened was a hallway of revisions, a place that promised to fix us by dismantling what we believed needed fixing. <words>277</words>
I stepped forward, perfectly flawed, and the watchers wrote a new margin note that pinched like a smirk in my ribs. <words>298</words>
Harvesting grace, the canyon informed me, required returning what was unearned and keeping only what could sing without applause. <words>317</words>
I thought about the tag, its thievery, my town, the pies, and how legends often begin with embarrassing inventory. <words>336</words>
So I cataloged my hungers aloud and set the tag on the floor, the barcode gazing up like a stubborn pupil. <words>357</words>
The first door shut, another opened, and inside we found the archive of pies baked and forgiven, maps made of sweetness. <words>378</words>
We dismantled our plan to conquer anything, choosing instead to harvest grace by feeding strangers until their names learned to linger. <words>399</words>
In that portal-strewn canyon, I became the librarian of appetites, a legend whispered through time over slices still warm. <words>418</words>
