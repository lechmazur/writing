I am the city mayor who cannot step past the threshold without my lungs remembering every open square forever. <words>19</words>
Agoraphobia keeps me diligent, bound to windows and ordinances, listening to citizens through cables like veins I dare not cross. <words>39</words>
Beyond the last trolley line, the whispering dunes ring the city like a patient, breathing wall. <words>55</words>
Their hiss is realistically fanciful, physics bent into myth by wind, grief, and the beer bottles we never quite recycle. <words>75</words>
My father left me a golden snuffbox with a hidden switch, and a calendar of promises nobody would envy. <words>94</words>
He called both items inherited burdens, smiling like a dock rope already fraying. <words>107</words>
When storms blow in from the flats, I govern via the rhythm of the rain tapping the office sash. <words>126</words>
Between songs on the public radio, I match each drop to a staircase of decisions, ascending without moving. <words>144</words>
Tonight, thunder stitches the dunes with needles of silver, and a particular tempo clicks inside the snuffbox. <words>161</words>
I press the hidden switch, and a panelized memory unfolds: my father walking out there alone, hat brimming sky. <words>180</words>
He had feared crowds too, but his fear marched him outward, as if the dunes themselves required tending. <words>198</words>
The box hums, and my office door seems to crack at the seam between duty and inheritance. <words>215</words>
I take the freight elevator down, eager resignation in my chest like a bird that trusts its cage. <words>233</words>
There is rain over sand tonight, the rarest percussion, and the dunes whisper names as if counting ballots. <words>251</words>
Between songs of wind through scrub grass, I step off the pavement and let the horizon unclench one finger. <words>270</words>
My body shakes, but the snuffbox keeps time, tiny gears answering raindrops the way a city answers sirens. <words>288</words>
A dune sighs open, and I see the municipal archive sealed in saltglass, charters braided with family decrees. <words>306</words>
The minutes of every meeting, the debts, the pardons, the fears, all tuned to rain like parish bells. <words>324</words>
I sit between songs the dunes are composing, and I write, not laws, but releases, margins for mercy and private space. <words>345</words>
When I sign my name, it is with his surname, my own tremor, and the rain's tempo braided through both. <words>365</words>
The dunes fall silent, then restart, as if the city has inhaled me and allowed me to choose where to stand. <words>386</words>
I turn back before dawn, knowing I may never love the plazas, yet I have rewritten how they touch me. <words>406</words>
I came here to rewrite personal destiny, not to banish fear, but to give it honest work and reasonable hours. <words>426</words>
