On the last dim berth of the asteroid hideout, I write the closing page of this forgotten journal. <words>18</words>
I am an introverted empath among space pirates, listening more than speaking, drifting with their sleepless engines like diluted tea. <words>38</words>
My tone is drowsy enthusiasm, a heat haze over purpose, yet it keeps the needles on my compass barely steady. <words>58</words>
The captain hoards relics in a vault with an obviously hidden door, which fools only those who never learned to look sideways. <words>80</words>
My task tonight is stranger, to marshal a quiet insurrection of clarity and comfort for the outcasts of reason. <words>99</words>
They slink between crates, brilliant misfits starved of patience, and they asked me for a map that argues back. <words>118</words>
I learned mountain wisdom from a geology monk on Phobos, who said peaks are teachers pretending to be obstacles. <words>137</words>
So I watch the vault like a slope, reading the fractures and snow lines in the stack of contraband puppets. <words>157</words>
One puppet lies in shards, a marionette broken by gravity, its strings like veins, its joints whispering a code of direction. <words>178</words>
I begin through reassembling fragments of a shattered marionette, aligning splinters until they become ridgelines and a river of shadow. <words>198</words>
The pieces click like crampons, and the pattern points past the vault, toward a maintenance tunnel where the air thrums softly. <words>219</words>
I cradle a dried starfish from my pocket, brittle as a small galaxy, and listen with my palms for tidal certainties. <words>240</words>
It was my only childhood toy, salvaged from a maritime museum, translation device for feelings that refuse intercoms and spectacle. <words>260</words>
Pressed to the welded wall, the starfish echoes a hush like snowfall, and I sense the bruised minds hiding inside. <words>280</words>
They are the mathematicians who blink too slowly for raids, the navigators who smell danger as colors, and they wait. <words>300</words>
I tell them the mountain wisdom that saved me, that patience is speed in disguise, that silence can pry locks open. <words>321</words>
Together we marshal our breaths and time the maintenance drones, stepping between their cones of light like skiers between trees. <words>341</words>
In the tunnel we find a console shaped like a cliff face, weathered by palms, its interface as stubborn as granite. <words>362</words>
I fit the reassembled marionette into a slot that pretends to be decoration, and the vault sighs awake like thaw. <words>382</words>
From within, not gold but permission slides out, authorizing safe quarters, shared rations, and lessons where paradox is homework. <words>401</words>
I sign this page with my careful drift, promising to champion the outcasts of reason until their arguments grow wings. <words>421</words>
The journal will end here, but in the obviously hidden morning between asteroids, our drowsy enthusiasm will inaugurate a quieter revolution. <words>442</words>
