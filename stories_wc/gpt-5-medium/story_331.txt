After the last mountain erodes, I tend the quantum entanglement garden behind the Archive of Breaths. <words>16</words>
I am its reserved caretaker, trained to listen to plants that remember each other across impossible distances. <words>33</words>
My excitement is a thin flame under glass, held with restraint because the world is fragile and listening. <words>51</words>
I am honestly dishonest when I write reports, admitting my tricks while disguising their reasons, because the truth needs costumes now. <words>72</words>
Our mandate is to preserve spiritual practices, but doctrine cannot outlast the soil unless it learns to move like water. <words>92</words>
So I cultivate teachings as seeds whose pods split when paired blossoms quiver in mutual, patient sympathy. <words>109</words>
The garden writes the future by interference patterns of scent and fluorescence, and I practice writing the future to keep the faith readable. <words>132</words>
To start the script, I agitate the dusk air until signals cohere like dew on a web. <words>149</words>
The method was taught by the flight of bats at dusk, whose errant veers stitched a grammar shadows could carry. <words>169</words>
I cue them with a forgotten music box, wound just enough to click, never enough to sing, so they chase the faintest shimmer. <words>192</words>
They wheel above the beds, folding the air into knots that force entwined orchids to answer their distant twins. <words>211</words>
In those answers, I hear elders who taught me to bow to what is not here yet, and to what refuses to leave. <words>234</words>
They ask me to guard the rituals without freezing them, and my reserved hands tremble with their difficult blessing. <words>253</words>
When the bats settle, the blossoms glow with paired pulses, and the soil exhales a map no eye can see at once. <words>275</words>
I read it with disciplined awe, tracing lines that bind tomorrow to yesterday, and yesterday to what never happened. <words>294</words>
Some would call that deceit, yet I am honestly dishonest only in service of a continuity the dead requested. <words>313</words>
I transcribe the garden into lean liturgies, ceremonies of breath and quiet drinking, small enough to pass through any ruin. <words>333</words>
The music box clicks, and I note its silence, because absence is a word the faithful must learn to pronounce. <words>353</words>
Far away, beyond where mountains once rose, relatives feel a soft pull and light incense, and our entangled prayers arrive. <words>373</words>
I smile within excited restraint, knowing that after the last mountain erodes there will still be a path the spirit can walk. <words>395</words>
Tomorrow, the bats will return, and the garden will remember us. <words>406</words>
