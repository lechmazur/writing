It happened at the close of a suitcase that may never reopen, inside an automated postal sorting facility humming like rain. <words>21</words>
I was a street musician moonlighting as a night sorter, fingers blistered from chords and cardboard alike. <words>38</words>
I had taken the job to find humor in cosmic absurdity, laughter stitched to despair like sequins to mourning. <words>57</words>
In my coat waited a vintage fountain pen, a relic from a pawnshop poet who swore it rewrote destinies. <words>76</words>
It drew lines that looked simple yet were complexly deceptive, weaving chevrons and loops like routes no map could confess. <words>96</words>
When the conveyor belts stalled, I traced those marks on packing slips to rewind time through forgotten patterns of address and return. <words>118</words>
Every attempt brought the crisp backlash of regrets, like rubber bands snapping from bundles that had been stretched too far. <words>138</words>
That night, a battered suitcase rattled past, tags from vanished cities flapping, and the line began to close around it. <words>158</words>
I heard the subtle sigh of zippers resigning, the close of a suitcase that may never reopen, containing someone's silence. <words>178</words>
I palmed the pen, inked a lattice over a crumpled label, and the facility lights flickered like uncertain applause. <words>197</words>
The belts seemed to rewind, parcel by parcel, and I glimpsed earlier hands packing socks, apologies, and rehearsed smiles. <words>216</words>
I remembered corners where I played for coins and forgave no one, least of all myself, for songs I never finished. <words>237</words>
The facility was a hall of complexly deceptive mirrors, every chute pretending to choose, while gravity did the choosing all along. <words>258</words>
So I told jokes to the barcode scanners, seeking to find humor in cosmic absurdity, and their lasers winked like patient elders. <words>280</words>
The suitcase thumped to my station, and the pen drew open its history: letters unsent, a sweater unkissed, a promise unpaid. <words>301</words>
When I touched the sweater, the backlash of regrets whipped me again, an orchestra of oughts sawing their brittle violins behind my ribs. <words>324</words>
Joyful despair bloomed, and I bowed to it, then redirected the parcels with a flourish, like conducting traffic through tears. <words>344</words>
I etched forgotten patterns across routing codes, sending the suitcase toward the owner it had before the breakup, before the winter. <words>365</words>
But the patterns were complexly deceptive, looping me back to the same bin, proving I could not change fates, only nudge punchlines. <words>387</words>
So I strummed the conveyor rails like strings, signed the air with the vintage fountain pen, and blessed the close with laughter. <words>409</words>
