<story>After the mirror cracks, I leave my studio above the harbor and follow the tide toward the caves. [18]
I am a nostalgic quay painter, intimately aloof with people, but unable to resist the salt ghosts of places. [37]
When the glass split, it cut my reflection into tidal shards, and one shard looked like a promise I had not kept. [59]
Years ago I swore to paint the inside of the sea, not just the docks where it holds its breath. [79]
In my pocket I carry a seashell, painted with a small quay and a small moon, a reminder of that vow. [100]
I painted the shell on a night when gulls slept and the harbor lights failed, and I whispered, tomorrow I go in. [122]
But the next day I stayed on the quay and painted reflections, careful replicas of a world that pretended not to move. [144]
Today, after the mirror cracks, I do not argue with my fear. [156]
I enter the first maw of the coastal cave network as the tide draws back, leaving a slick alphabet on the stones. [178]
The ceiling breathes in mineral syllables, and my footfalls thrum with other painters, other tides. [193]
I walk by the beam of a lantern and the softer glow of the painted shell cupped in my palm. [213]
Its lacquer catches hints of light, makes a tiny harbor float over my fingers like a boat that forgot the shore. [234]
Pathways fork and crawl, and I choose the way that smells of brine and old smoke, because memory is my untrustworthy compass. [256]
A wrong turn leads to a hidden oasis, a round chamber where fresh water rings a column of light pouring from a crack in the roof. [282]
The air smells like wet limestone and quince, as if the earth nurse had washed fruit in her palms. [301]
Here the walls curve into a natural mirror, and I see myself split again, not by glass but by time appearing on itself. [324]
The pool shows the quay I paint and the quay I avoid, the years I offered to motion, and the years I refused. [347]
It is temporary eternity, the moment that repeats without owning a single second, the tide holding still while everything moves. [367]
I stand very still, intimately aloof from the world that might call me back, and I listen for the promise. [387]
It arrives as a memory of a brush pulling water across gesso, a voice no larger than a quill, saying, keep it. [409]
To keep what, I ask, and the pool quivers like soft glass forgetting itself and then remembering. [426]
To keep a hidden promise to oneself, the voice answers, which is to say to keep yourself from vanishing into copies. [447]
I kneel at the rim and dip the painted seashell into the oasis, and the lacquer takes a clear breath. [467]
The shell is a boat again, a quay again, a mouth that once spoke and now opens to saltless water. [487]
I touch the mirror wall with my wet fingers and draw the line of the harbor I never painted, the one beneath the quay. [511]
The surface holds for a breath, then gives, and the liquid seams open to reveal a corridor of light under the stone. [533]
I walk in, because the wrong turn has become the right door, and this, too, is temporary eternity, a passage that lasts only once. [557]
Inside, the walls are painted with tides that painted themselves, spirals of foam, ladders of fish, all made by centuries of patience. [579]
I realize I must add only a breath, a hue no longer than a sigh, or I will break the promise again. [601]
With the shell I wet the tip of my smallest brush and lay a single curve where the light and shadow trade hands. [624]
The curve gathers the chamber into a harbor that was always there, and for a breath the pool and the mirror agree. [646]
In that agreement the crack above becomes a star, and the star becomes a sound, and the sound tells me to leave it. [669]
I want to stay, but keeping the promise means not living in the painting, only letting it breathe without me. [689]
I back away as the corridor closes, and the pool returns to its first language. [704]
When I return to day, the gulls are awake, and the harbor holds its breath the way a child hides joy. [725]
My mirror at home is still cracked, but I do not fix it, because now it reflects the split I chose. [746]
On the quay I set up my easel again, and I paint the harbor as it inhales and exhales, once and forever. [768]
I do not sign, because the sea already has, and the shell in my pocket is warm with its small moon. [789]</story>
