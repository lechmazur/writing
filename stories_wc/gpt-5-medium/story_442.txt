I am an edgy tradesman who rebuilds memories like cabinets, sanding what splinters, staining what refuses to forget. <words>18</words>
Tonight I work inside a giant mushroom house, its gills ribbed like rafters, its damp breathing a blur the lanterns barely tame. <words>40</words>
Outside, during the final rotation of a forgotten windmill, the world ticks in slow bruised circles I can almost hear. <words>60</words>
My client, Mira, brings me a torn corner of a flyer that once promised a festival nobody remembers attending. <words>79</words>
She wants the night back, not to relive it, but to carry a flickering candle through an endless void she cannot map alone. <words>102</words>
I am comfortingly pessimistic, promising failure with the gentleness of a quilt, because certainty is the sharpest chisel and it always slips. <words>124</words>
Still, we clear a space on a spongy table, and I pull wires from my bag, vectorize the fragments, and translate longing into angles. <words>148</words>
We will walk the memory together via synchronized watches, meeting on each minute like rungs, stepping down the stem, deeper into the rooms. <words>171</words>
The house guides us like a patient hallucination, its pores sweating spices, its wallpaper a bloom of maps that stubbornly refuse to stay still. <words>195</words>
Mira keeps fingering the torn corner, as if the missing paper edge could unlock a streetlight or a mouth or a name. <words>217</words>
Her father ran the windmill once, she says, and when it stopped, the musicians vanished, leaving only dust that sang in their absence. <words>240</words>
We set our watches, tiny moons trembling, and I light a stub of wax that shines like a question trying to become a path. <words>264</words>
On zero we inhale, and the mushroom dilates, exhaling corridors where laughter smears, and my tools become termites nibbling pixels from the air. <words>287</words>
Every measurement skews, the tape trembling over distances that breathe, a necessary distortion of memory that keeps us from mistaking ghosts for furniture. <words>310</words>
I tell her the trick is not accuracy but balance: hold sorrow like a level, and the bubble returns you to unbroken thresholds. <words>333</words>
We arrive at a door of spore-brown lacquer, just where her flyer claims the band would play, and the watches pulse in aching unison. <words>357</words>
Inside, chairs wait like closed parentheses, and the stage is a shallow pond whose surface forgets every ripple the instant it forms. <words>379</words>
I vectorize again, drawing axes through the silence, and Mira places the torn corner where the applause should start, a dowel in the hinge. <words>403</words>
When the windmill outside gasps into stillness, our watches click, and the candle gutters, but she steadies it with both hands, eyes brimming and clear. <words>428</words>
We cannot bring the night back, I say, but we can carry its smallest fire forward, a seam of blurry vividness that refuses to go out. <words>454</words>
