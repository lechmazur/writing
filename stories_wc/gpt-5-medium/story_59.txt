I arrived at the echo chamber testing site with a guitar that sounded older than my bones. <words>17</words>
They led me past coils of cable and foam walls that drank every sigh, and my own footsteps felt borrowed. <words>37</words>
As a mournful troubadour, I was here to measure what a song becomes when the air refuses to carry it. <words>57</words>
The technician handed me an embroidered collar, fitted with sensors that would translate pulse and tremor into graphs like winter branches. <words>78</words>
Its thread smelled faintly of cedar and old stages, as if stitched by someone who knew my circuits of vanishing crowds. <words>99</words>
I had come amid silent struggles to discover the heartbeat of nothingness, when even the night birds censored themselves and every mirror argued with the morning. <words>125</words>
The project lead described my life as strangely predictable, a loop of towns, polite clapping, and the backstage ache after brief applause. <words>147</words>
Her words landed like prewritten chords, forcing me to confront the past I tuned around but never retuned. <words>165</words>
To begin, she said, follow your star trails, and the ceiling opened with a dome of projected skies mapped to my biometric hesitation. <words>188</words>
I stepped into the circle, and the dome constellations slid when I breathed, negotiating routes through a history I had mistaken for weather. <words>211</words>
Each star blink was a town, a face, a letter I never mailed, and the guitar strings tightened like a question. <words>232</words>
I began to play not to enchant but to demystify, stripping my melodies of ornaments the way snow strips leaves from quiet courtyards. <words>255</words>
The sensors translated the tremor into a slow line that stuttered whenever memory pretended bravery, which was often. <words>273</words>
I spoke to the dome with intimate detachment, naming names I had once hidden under rhymes, and the names lost their teeth. <words>295</words>
The collar warmed at my throat like a small hearth, and I realized the stage had taught me how to applaud absence. <words>317</words>
I followed the star trails deeper, to a blank region where the graphs steadied, and there the project lead whispered, listen for nothing. <words>340</words>
In that hush I heard a pulse not mine, the heartbeat of nothingness, patient as rain behind a locked theater door. <words>361</words>
It was not death and not comfort, but a room of possibility where songs cease pleading and begin to point. <words>381</words>
I understood that my road had been strangely predictable because I kept editing the map, refusing the paths that returned me to origin. <words>404</words>
By the end, I left the testing site carrying the embroidered collar like a vow, ready to tour the unmapped silence I finally trusted. <words>428</words>
