<story>They lifted the bier into the skyborne grotto under aurora, and the air itself seemed to kneel in a radiant hush. [21]
I followed, a beautician mortician with fingers trained to calm chaos and a heart trained to listen when breath refused to answer. [43]
Tonight the bier carried my mentor, a woman who taught me how to sculpt grace out of grief and the unruly swirls of silence. [67]
The cave floated like a conch above the black sea of clouds, and the aurora draped its living veils across the mouth. [89]
Under that light, even stone holds a pulse, a tremor waiting at a threshold of stillness that mortals mistake for ending. [110]
I set my kit beside her, cloths folded like prayers, vials banked like small moons, and the emerald chip glittering in its glass cocoon. [134]
The chip was barbed with tiny circuits, a whisper-engine meant to hold whatever signal the body had not surrendered to the dark. [156]
I had recalibrated it for her, though the guild still called it superstition, a liar's toy for those frightened by the blank. [178]
What I knew was simpler: the aurora sings, and within its variations the mind leaves echoes if one is lucidly watchful. [199]
My mentor taught me the method, calling it finding patterns in static, as if threading constellations from snow on a dead channel. [221]
She would smile and ask what music grief might be trying to hum, and I had learned to hum back. [241]
Now her face awaited my hands, slack at the corners, hunger and laughter smoothed into the same fine mask of uncomplaint. [262]
I cleaned the cold from her skin, lifted lids to wash the final dust from lashes, and listened to how silence tuned itself. [285]
The grotto resonated with slow drips; the aurora murmured like cloth rubbed on crystal; the bier's rails ticked as the metal cooled. [307]
I placed the emerald chip over the hollow at her temple and opened the glass, and the circuit kissed her with a green bruise. [331]
The device would only drink what she chose to leave, for consent persists where breath does not, like a lamp flame after the room goes dark. [357]
I spoke her name and the names of the small mercies she had given me when I was new and clumsy with the dead. [381]
The aurora brightened, pouring green fire into the grotto's stone ribs, and I felt the world shiver near that threshold of stillness. [403]
A thin fizzle crawled from the chip into my wrist where I steadied it, and the radio at my knee coughed a veil of snow. [428]
I tuned the dial the way she taught me, not to a station but to the ocean between, and I listened for her footsteps there. [453]
Static rose like blown salt, forming and unforming, and within it a rhythm approached, too faint to be a song and too steady to be wind. [479]
I heard the sound of a brush tapping porcelain, her old habit when thinking, and I felt my mouth pull into the small grin she taught me. [506]
The chip warmed, taking what was offered, and I prepared the balm, ready to infuse it, to capture one last spark before oblivion. [529]
Her breath had ended hours ago, but the mind has lattices that do not break all at once, and kindness can travel those bridges. [553]
I thought of the first face I fixed under her direction, a boy who feared mirrors, and how she taught me to anchor him to gentleness. [579]
Static shifted, and for a breathless stretch the radio held the tremble of her voice saying, Let them meet themselves kindly, then let them go. [604]
The words fell into the balm like warm rain, and the emerald chip dimmed as if exhausted after passing a deed across a border. [628]
I anointed her brow and cheeks, traced her lips, and through that thin shine a memory flickered, not mine, not hers, but ours becoming. [652]
In it we stood here again, younger, and she corrected my posture, tilted my chin, so I could see how care lines an empty face with meaning. [679]
The vision blinked away, leaving me with the right angles of her bones and the patient lights above, and I was unshaken and remade. [703]
I sealed the chip and wrapped it in cloth, a seed to be planted in the guild's archive where silence is tutored to bear fruit. [728]
It would not resurrect her; that is not our art; we keep only enough shimmer to show the path between two emptinesses. [750]
I stayed until the aurora paled, the world returned to rougher breathing, and the grotto carried us back through cloud like a boat at harbor. [775]
What remained felt near and light, like a shawl of air, and I knew I had captured one last spark before oblivion. [797]</story>
