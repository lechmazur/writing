<story>Throughout moving day, I carried boxes through the wind-swept fortress in a valley of howling caverns, promising myself I would not drop anything else I loved. <words>26</words>
I am a rash protector, quick to shield, quicker to err, and the stone corridors seemed to wince at my clattering devotion. <words>48</words>
In a corner tower, amid drafts smelling of snow and iron, I found a collection of old postcards bound by twine and a lost intention. <words>73</words>
Each card showed skies over ports and deserts, compass roses scribbled with coordinates, and in their foxed borders I heard the hush of distant, listening constellations. <words>99</words>
I wanted to find solace in the vastness of the cosmos, to quiet the noise that made my care feel more like collision than shelter. <words>124</words>
So I took a different route home from the storage yard, and had a chance encounter while taking a different route home with a woman holding a brass sextant. <words>153</words>
She wore a coat patched with star maps and asked me why I moved with such restless gravity, as if the floor might collapse without my weight. <words>180</words>
I told her I keep breaking, then mending, because a universally unique promise thrums in my ribs: that no one will fall while I am watching. <words>206</words>
She turned the sextant toward the courtyard, where dust devils played among crates, and set the arc so the instrument clicked, a tiny verdict of direction. <words>232</words>
In that click came the dawn of awareness, a sunrise tucked inside metal, and I realized the postcards were not souvenirs but coordinates for a pilgrimage we could begin. <words>261</words>
She asked whether I would trust the sky to teach me how to protect without bruising the world, and I said yes before caution could find its shoes. <words>289</words>
We climbed to the parapet, wind combing our names into salt, and sorted the postcards by the tone of their horizons, like shells arranged by the sea itself. <words>317</words>
Each address pointed to an echo inside the caverns, and each echo threaded into the valley winds, until the fortress became a lung we breathed with careful courage. <words>345</words>
My hands, always too ready, finally learned to quiet in the intervals between gusts, to listen for the spaces where care shapes itself without force. <words>370</words>
Moving day extended into evening as stars rose, and I mailed the first postcard to the future, promising to arrive wherever the sextant opened a door. <words>396</words>
In that mystical reality, home became a direction rather than a room, and the chance encounter became companionship, and my protection became gentleness expanding to meet the immensity above. <words>425</words>
