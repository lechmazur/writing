<story>We kept the vigil on the ambered observatory deck, a honeyed dome set adrift after the universe contracts and the lights of memory cooled into a hush. [27]
I was the cast lots decision maker, a title as antique as the coins I carried and as necessary as heat in the winter of space. [53]
My collection of foreign coins rang like compact planets, each stamped with extinct alphabets that refused to translate, yet eager to be flipped and read by chance. [80]
Sori was quietly enthusiastic, tending the receivers as if they were seedlings, shading them from the crackle of interference with palms still callused from another era. [106]
Our method for hearing what remained of intention was simple to say and ruinous to master: understanding static bursts, and letting the snow speak syllables of rearranged time. [134]
From the glare of collapsed starlight came a backwards prophecy, a script that read like footprints pointing toward us from the future we had already untaken. [160]
It named no heroes, only sequences and wavelengths, as if the universe had left us a recipe in reverse, the last garnish described before the first flame. [187]
We took turns breathing to the metronome of fallen pulsars, trying to wavelength align with purpose, not faith, because faith felt too brittle for this era. [213]
Stellar doubt pooled at our feet like black dew, yet Sori hummed beneath her breath, a countercurrent of courage that tugged at my reluctant bones. [238]
When the receivers steadied, the deck ripened into amber through the viewport, the gas clouds thick as fossilized sap, and the prophecy filed backward across the glass. [265]
It said, First, you will have turned the dome, then you will have distilled the noise, and earlier still you will have trusted the blind toss. [291]
I steadied my hands and laid out the coins on felt, the collection of foreign coins gleaming with rainbows from worlds no longer in any astronomical address. [318]
One disk sunburnt from a desert planet, one punched with a square hole like a remembered window, one featherlight alloy that chimed a sad, thin yes when spun. [346]
People thought casting lots was abdication, but I had learned it was a way to crack the amber of intention, to let the uncertainty breathe around the choice. [374]
The first flip clattered, and Sori marked the result on the phase table, her eyes bright but calm, quietly enthusiastic about the universe bargaining with us through ceremony. [402]
The second flip answered, heads on the square window, and the dome groaned as we reversed the gyros, turning the deck to face a silence with the posture of listening. [432]
Only afterward did I see how the prophecy braided us, because having turned the dome, we had already fulfilled the middle clause, compelling us to distill what roared like stormwater. [462]
Sori bled the receivers, purging hiss and ghost harmonics, and I held the copper still, letting the snow of the cosmos settle until it clumped into words. [489]
Understanding arrived as a taste before it was meaning, and I realized our method was not analysis but surrender, an intimacy with noise that could not be hurried. [517]
The backwards prophecy bloomed a final instruction, which, since it was first in its own order, had to be our last: trust the blind toss you have already trusted. [546]
I laughed once, startled that certainty should be asked of a randomizer, and felt the old shame of my title fall away like a husk from new fruit. [574]
I was the cast lots decision maker because causality ran uphill here, and we needed a hand brave enough to release cause and catch its echoing effect. [601]
One by one, I flipped the remaining worlds, and their faces stitched a pattern that Sori read not forward but inward, a map of resonance for the dome. [629]
We tuned the gyros to those intervals, and our breathing to those intervals, and the static softened, as if the dead stars were pleased to be asked politely for once. [659]
The dome dilated, swallowing the amber until it became a lens, and beneath it the universe, not expanding but remembering itself, exhaled a corridor of usable silence. [686]
Through that corridor came a shoreless feeling, that we were already on the far side of our choice, and only the enactment remained, matter following the memo. [713]
Sori nodded, and I gathered the coins, their planetary faces warming my palm, and together we faced the hush, understanding static bursts as prayer and purpose at last. [741]</story>
