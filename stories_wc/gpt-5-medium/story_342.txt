In the lull between echoing thunder and fresh rain, I drifted into the orchard that keeps changing shape. <words>18</words>
As a careless pilot grounded by chance, I navigated by nose and memory rather than by instruments. <words>35</words>
The twisted orchard labyrinth in an enchanted oak grove felt mapped by ripening scents and sly, whispering bark. <words>53</words>
My purpose was to archive natural patterns, yet my notebook stayed shut because the air wore a sly smile. <words>72</words>
I told myself to be deliberately dreamy, the only way to see the orchard the way the orchard sees me. <words>92</words>
A worn-out glove dangled from my belt like a talisman, its stitching frayed into delicate cartographic lines. <words>109</words>
The glove once belonged to another pilot who survived a fog bank I carelessly entered and somehow exited laughing. <words>128</words>
Since that day, I have flown on borrowed memories that are not mine, favored routes stitched by someone else. <words>147</words>
They steer my hands, nudge my eyes, and hush the panic when clouds step too close to the propeller. <words>166</words>
I arrived to emancipate myself from those borrowed itineraries, by investigating sinister doodles on used postcards. <words>182</words>
The postcards hung like fruit from threads knotted to low branches, each bent card muttering a destination. <words>199</words>
I plucked one, and a runway smell rose, tar and dandelion, and the glove twitched as if remembering a flare. <words>219</words>
The doodle showed a spiral orchard with a tiny plane at the center, circled by arrows like playful vultures. <words>238</words>
I traced the arrows, and the grove shivered, rearranging rows until the path ahead widened like a runway. <words>256</words>
Resigned exuberance filled me, a buoyant acceptance that I could love my errors and still leave them behind. <words>274</words>
Every oak hummed like a sealed engine, and rain waited just beyond the sky, holding its breath for a cue. <words>294</words>
I read more cards, collecting doodled isobars, lightning zigzags, and small decimals that counted wingbeats across storms. <words>311</words>
Each mark taught a pattern, and I copied them into my field guide, which smelled of mold, citrus, and fuel. <words>331</words>
The glove held the pages steady while I listened to rain approach, applauding somewhere I could not yet see. <words>350</words>
When thunder finally echoed, I felt the postcards loosen, and I knew the grove would accept a trade. <words>368</words>
I fed the glove to a hollowness between roots, a mouth of oak that prefers fabric knotted with flight. <words>387</words>
In return, the oak released my borrowed memories, like birds startled from rafters, and they flew into the rain. <words>406</words>
Empty and oddly whole, I stood with new hands and charted the breathing of leaves in generous, unfakeable rhythms. <words>425</words>
I would fly again with my own mistakes, and archive their patterns, and let them instruct the orchard when needed. <words>445</words>
For now I waited in the hushed interval, feeling the grove replot its paths, while fresh rain stitched beginnings. <words>464</words>
