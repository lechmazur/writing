<story>I return to the radiant grotto in mist before anyone wakes, carrying the dull brass of my sax like an amulet against remembering. [23]
I am the morning fog saxophonist, a title earned by playing what cannot be played without the fog to hold the notes. [45]
I came as dewdrops form, when the air is brightest with listening, to hush a prophecy spoken in code before it finishes pronouncing itself. [69]
The elders called the task a vested hush, not mere silence, but a garment of stillness worn over the mouth of time. [91]
They built the prism atrium in mist above the cavern, a glass canopy whose facets scatter dawn into softly disciplined corridors of color. [114]
The light there is quietly vivid, as if the past has been rinsed and hung up to dry in narrow, trembling ribbons. [136]
In that atrium the prophecy appears each morning, lettered not in ink but in condensation joining points like constellations across the cold panes. [159]
As the lines finish their glistening strokes, the sentences begin to attract attention from things with more hunger than patience. [179]
The grotto listens, and something beyond the ridge listens, and I cannot let them hear it complete. [196]
My teacher showed me the method, years ago when we thought secrecy and music were the same craft. [214]
You move through negative space, she said, you shape the gaps, and a whisper placed exactly there will interrupt the sentence without any mark. [238]
But I have not seen her since the last hush, and the memory smells of ash and rain and the damp coat she left behind. [263]
Eerie nostalgia is the music that rises when I lift the instrument, the same ache that the rock carries from tide to tide. [286]
I take my place under the facets, and the atrium breathes, and the first letters pearl into being. [304]
Each drop chooses a point, and the points choose grammar older than our tongues, and my hands begin their learned tremor. [325]
I draw breath and let a thread of sound go wandering, not to announce, not to impress, but to blur the joining of the code. [350]
The tones climb the glass like steam, then retreat into corners where meaning tends to collect, and there they widen into a hush you can wear. [376]
It is a vested hush because I have sworn it, and because the city dressing my oath in threadbare law expects the garment to fit. [401]
If it slips, the listeners outside will read a future that uses us up like salt in a rainstorm, and they will come smiling. [425]
So I play softly, letting the fog carry the weight, letting the gaps between notes hold the intention, and the letters stutter on the panels. [450]
Through one facet I see my teacher as she was, reflected thinly, her mouth forming a warning that I cannot quite decipher. [472]
I answer by changing embouchure, feathering breath until the sound is almost only warmth, and the sentence that tried to become a map fogs over. [497]
A second line descends, colder, naming a city I love in syllables of frost, and I slide into a lower register that cancels its pairing. [522]
The work goes on minute by minute, as dewdrops form and fall and return, the nerve of prophecy teased but never gratified. [544]
Sometimes I whisper into the bell to guide the shapes, and the echoes climb back into my throat tasting of iron and sea. [567]
When the last figure on the glass hesitates, I give it a lullaby I learned from gulls and trains, and the meaning loosens like thread. [592]
By then the grotto is bright enough to see the absence I have made, a ring where the sentence nearly closed, now held open and harmless. [618]
I leave as the city wakes and the mist withdraws, carrying the instrument that keeps my memories at an eerie nostalgia, and the oath holds. [643]</story>
