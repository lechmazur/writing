After the last wish is granted, the frozen orchard exhales a glittering fog that smells like apples and old mothballs. <words>20</words>
This is a frozen orchard feeding off geothermal streams, where roots sip warmth while branches practice the art of stillness. <words>40</words>
I am the ghostly caretaker, both solemnly silly and stern, weaving through fate like thread slipped through a shaking needle. <words>60</words>
My work continues because quiet refuses to stay, and the orchard asks for jokes the way frost asks for moonlight. <words>80</words>
Animals visit the steaming rows, leaving hoofprints and whisker marks on bark as if signing their names in cryptic cursive. <words>100</words>
I want to communicate with animals, not to command them, but to harmonize the orchard choir with their tender, inconvenient truths. <words>121</words>
The method arrived through forbidden expedition logs, smuggled notebooks from explorers who charted heat veins and listened to fox laughter. <words>141</words>
They taught me to perforate the ice skins around words, to pierce silence so meaning can fizz like cider. <words>160</words>
Their diagrams said build a flute from what the world discards, so I salvaged a plastic straw from a stranded sled. <words>181</words>
It was green and cheerful, absurd against the solemn orchard, perfect for a caretaker trying to be gently chaotic and clear. <words>202</words>
I practiced scales between rime jeweled branches until crows gathered, tilting their heads like readers of a difficult love letter. <words>222</words>
Gentle chaos slipped in, because every note startled a rabbit, and every rabbit startled a note, an accidental duet of sprints. <words>243</words>
I laughed solemnly at my own failures, the way a priest might chuckle at incense that smells suspiciously of pancakes. <words>263</words>
Yet beneath the silliness lay the orchard code, and the logs warned the language would appear only after the last wish. <words>284</words>
So I waited until midnight, when the final wish ripened and dropped without sound, a star fruit bruising the snow. <words>304</words>
The geothermal streams sighed, the orchard shivered awake, and the flute straw vibrated with a low, believable sentence about warm stones. <words>325</words>
Foxes answered first, explaining their routes as cross stitches between dens, weaving through fate by smell, by patience, by tiny daring. <words>346</words>
Then elk traced arithmetic with hooves, measuring thaw times, and magpies traded metaphors for buttons, while voles complained about the uninvited owls. <words>368</words>
I kept notes in charcoal along the bark, promising to steward their stories, to mend grafts where language had once frozen shut. <words>390</words>
When morning brushed the orchard silver, I returned the expedition logs, left the plastic straw in the roots, and walked on humming. <words>412</words>
