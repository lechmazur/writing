<story>After seeing my own grave on the ridge, I returned to the mountain ranger cabin with jaded wonder. [18]
I am a lucid dream chronicler, chronologically confused, yet paid in coffee and leave slips to map sleeping weather. [37]
The grave was smaller than memory, stones stacked like unsent letters, a name I keep mispronouncing because time mispronounced me. [57]
Inside the cabin, the stove ticked, snow rasped the windows, and the logbook smelled like wet wool and ghosts. [76]
But it was the birch bark scroll in the map drawer that begged to be touched. [92]
Someone had scraped its surface thin as breath, and inked a trail of dreams in erratic, glittering dates. [110]
They looped backward, forward, sideways, like trout dodging a hook, like calendars in a landslide. [125]
I wanted, more than warmth, to distill chaos into narrative, because narratives are the only heat that lasts. [143]
Feral nostalgia paced the room, baring its teeth in the reflection of the cabin window, hungry for an earlier me. [163]
It wanted the hiker with uncracked knees, the ranger with a radio that still summoned answers and coffee that tasted like rain. [185]
So I used my oldest method, getting jealous of past selves until the present brightened like magnesium. [202]
Jealousy sharpened the edges of the scroll, and letters climbed off the bark like ants carrying crumbs of memory. [221]
I traced them, murmuring their dates, knowing the order was wrong, but wanting the wrongness to confess its pattern. [240]
A storm thumped the roof, and I brewed spruce tea as if patience could be steeped. [256]
When sleep came, it peered through the window first, testing my doubt for tenderness. [270]
Then the floor rose like a wave, and I stepped onto it with my boots unlaced, the cabin buoyant as a leaf. [292]
Dreams know my name because I autograph them for a living, or a dying, whatever order I wake into. [311]
I soared over the ridge where the grave waited, and the snow hissed like applause withheld. [327]
From above, the stones formed my initials and then unraveled into a trail of question marks heading off the mountain. [347]
I was chronologically confused again, because my first patrol was happening beside my tenth failure, and both waved politely. [366]
Past me carried a radio that hummed with weather, present me floated with a kettle, future me scribbled on the scroll. [387]
The jealous one pursued them, a hound of comparison, and the clarity of pursuit made the air thin and exact. [407]
I choose to soar, I told the mountain, not away but along, like a sentence trailing its predicate. [425]
The cabin kept up, its stovepipe drawing a line through the sky to underline the day I died. [443]
Below, rangers clustered around a burial I do not remember arranging, their hats held to their hearts like closed books. [463]
I wanted to descend, to correct the program, to tell them I was writing still, and not to waste the shovels. [484]
But the dream knew better, and replaced my urgency with ink, filled the sky with script that kept reforming my name. [505]
In each reform, a small creature of feral nostalgia crouched, guarding a glinting syllable with claws politely sheathed. [523]
I bargained with it, trading the envy I felt for the younger ranger for a promise of continuity. [541]
Continuity is a trick river plays on stones, I said, and the creature let one syllable go. [558]
It fell onto the birch bark scroll now stretched across the sky, and a paragraph began to behave. [576]
The dates lined up like switchbacks, leading down to the grave, up to the lookout, and inward to the kettle hissing. [597]
By aligning them, I did not resurrect myself; I only gave my endings a place to meet my beginnings for coffee. [618]
Jaded wonder is the flavor of that coffee, bitter as spruce pitch, sweet as a thaw you do not trust. [638]
I wrote fast, because the dream was losing altitude, and the stove in waking life wanted feeding. [655]
I wrote slow, because chaos requires respect, and I have made a profession of bowing to it without kneeling. [674]
When I woke, snow crouched at the windowsill like a sentinel, and the kettle had sighed itself senseless. [692]
The scroll lay on the table, faintly warm, its letters arranged into a map of overlapping patrols and departures. [711]
Through the frost, the ridge watched, and the grave waited without accusation, merely balancing the ledger of weather and footfall. [731]
I packed the birch bark scroll with the first aid kit, because language can bleed, and I am the one who dresses it. [754]
Outside, ravens rehearsed insults until they were poems, and I felt ready to patrol the day after my own funeral. [774]
The trick is to keep walking, chronologically confused but forward, and to let the narrative soar somewhere just ahead, dragging you kindly. [796]</story>
