<story>During the hush of a streetlamp flickering out, a hopeful knight slipped into the hedge maze without armor. <words>18</words>
He was cleverly naive enough to believe that chivalry could mend the city's grief like stitching fallen dusk. <words>36</words>
Maps spoke of a mystic orchard garden concealed within a hedge maze, where broken hours grew on whispering boughs. <words>55</words>
There, the machine that cycles regrets drank moonlight from leaves and exhaled a soft metallic lullaby over roots. <words>73</words>
He had come to sabotage the machine that cycles regrets, not with violence, but with a faithful listening. <words>91</words>
The orchard chimed like teeth in a smile too wide, agonizing bliss pressing sweetness and ache into the same breath. <words>111</words>
Each tree bore a bell of polished seed, and each bell rang the name of someone reclaiming the lost. <words>130</words>
He had lost his mother to the machine's gray churn when it harvested her regret and replanted it as routine. <words>150</words>
Tonight he vowed to neutralize its appetite by syncing with cryptic frequencies that hid between the bells' shy harmonics. <words>169</words>
He drew a stray jigsaw edge from his pocket, a silver sliver scavenged from puzzles scattered by the machine's wind. <words>189</words>
That edge fit nowhere, and therefore everywhere, the un-corner of a picture the city had misremembered. <words>205</words>
He pressed the edge to his tongue, tasted tin and orchard honey, and heard the hidden tempo behind the lullaby. <words>225</words>
Cleverly naive, he believed the heart could tune anything if the heart stayed slightly broken. <words>240</words>
He breathed with the bells, and with the moth-hum of the streetlamp's last filament, and with the roots drinking starlight. <words>260</words>
The frequencies cracked his memory open like a pomegranate, seeds of scenes spilling, bleeding sweetness, stinging truth. <words>277</words>
He saw the day he let her go with a shrug, and the night he swallowed her goodbye to stay brave. <words>298</words>
Agonizing bliss gutted him, yet balanced him, and the jigsaw edge began to hum in sympathy with the orchard's bells. <words>318</words>
He stepped to the machine that cycles regrets and slipped the edge into a seam shaped like a withheld answer. <words>338</words>
Then he sang, not words but intervals, by syncing with cryptic frequencies learned from bells, from breath, from an uncornered hope. <words>359</words>
The machine hiccupped, paused, and in that pause the city's regrets lost their handles, spilled, and washed roots clean. <words>378</words>
His mother's regret unraveled like ribbon and returned as a shawl of warmth, draping his shoulders with patient forgiveness. <words>397</words>
In that gentled weight he understood reclaiming the lost is not reversing time, but unhooking time from its choking loop. <words>417</words>
The orchard sighed, the streetlamp died fully, and the maze's hedges parted like curtains to show dawn rehearsing. <words>435</words>
He left the mystic orchard garden concealed within a hedge maze with nothing in his hands but a steadied pulse. <words>455</words>
Behind him, the machine that cycles regrets settled into silence, not dead, but listening, neutralized by his unbeautiful, necessary song. <words>475</words></story>
