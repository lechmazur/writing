<story>Between calls, the steampunk lounge hummed with valves and whispers like overworked hearts learning to keep their secrets quiet. <words>19</words>
I played the street performer, clockwork braces on my wrists, yet every trick stuttered, creatively blocked by a silence I nurtured. <words>40</words>
On the bar slept a rusted knight's gauntlet, its joints clotted with time, a relic I kept for both audience and penance. <words>62</words>
Every hour, I made it grip a rose of coiled copper, a pantomime of chivalry that hid my coded desperation. <words>82</words>
Because tonight my sworn adversary would walk in, and I had resolved to offer peace, though it tasted like ash and wine. <words>104</words>
He had once exposed my secret, that my miracles were ciphers for ruptured promises, and the city applauded while I learned to vanish. <words>127</words>
Yet the season had eaten my fury; coin tins grew lighter, applause thinned, and my hands forgot how to shape astonishment. <words>148</words>
I had to remember, via the texture of a coral reef I once touched on a far pier, how roughness can teach tenderness. <words>171</words>
The gauntlet's pitted steel rasped like limestone alive with hidden gardens, and my pulse settled into a briny, careful rhythm. <words>191</words>
Between calls from clientele with appetites for illusions, I rehearsed an offering built from mechanics and forgiveness, something fragile yet exact. <words>212</words>
A miniature bellows would breathe through the gauntlet, lifting the rose, then folding the petals back, a metallic heartbeat yielding. <words>232</words>
Carved on the palm, a phrase only he would read: a trust renewed, if you dare, signed in the old streetmark. <words>253</words>
I tuned the pipes to the note he favored, the one he claimed sounded like keys finding daylight after rust. <words>273</words>
The lounge's owner watched, polishing goggles, muttering that truce is poor theater, but I traded spectacle for breath I could bear. <words>294</words>
When my adversary arrived, coat damp with fog, his eyes were the color of storm-warmed brass, and he asked for water. <words>315</words>
I set the gauntlet before him, wound the gears, and let the rose rise and fall like apology breathing in its sleep. <words>337</words>
He flinched, then placed his scarred fingers against the metal, as though feeling the tide pools inside it, and his jaw eased. <words>359</words>
We remembered our first betrayal together, not with names, but with textures, counting knuckles, counting dents, counting breaths the bellows refused to skip. <words>382</words>
Between calls the lounge grew quietly immense, and the audience learned to keep still, as if the hush itself could weld broken law. <words>405</words>
He lifted the rose and said, not loudly, that peace might work if made by hand, and I could finally breathe again. <words>427</words></story>
