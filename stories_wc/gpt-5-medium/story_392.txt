<story>After the last human memory was digitized, the star chart reading room fell into a loud silence I could conjure but not trust. <words>23</words>
I am a skeptical conjurer employed here to pull patterns from hushed constellations like scarves from a clenched fist. <words>42</words>
My motive, declared in a contract signed with a jittering stylus, is to archive storm sounds before they evaporate from the servers. <words>64</words>
For lures I keep an antique thimble collection, each metal cap a tiny drum that remembers thunder when tapped. <words>83</words>
Storms love mysterious partings, the splits between clouds and roofs, old friends and platforms, questions and the mouths that formed them. <words>104</words>
The charts overhead are literally figurative, constellations shaped like hands waving goodbye as if sky itself specialized in departures. <words>123</words>
To categorize the storms, I compile their profiles by combining overheard lines from chatty rideshare drivers passing beneath our dome. <words>143</words>
They say, You can smell rain like a coin on your tongue, or, My ex left with the wind, and I fold those words into my thimbles. <words>170</words>
When the thimbles hum, each note points to a quadrant of the ceiling where a star once guided a body home. <words>191</words>
Skepticism keeps me from worship, but not from craft; I know illusions can ferry truth like smugglers in plain uniforms. <words>211</words>
My mother parted without farewell the night her memories were uploaded, leaving me with a digital recording of her laughter and a cupboard of needles. <words>236</words>
I conjure her voice sometimes, but my skepticism insists the echo belongs to circuitry, not to love. <words>253</words>
Tonight a storm approaches the dome like an estranged relative, its lightning counting itself, its rain rehearsing footfalls of return. <words>273</words>
I line the thimbles across the circular table, each one destined for a different pitch of anger or relief. <words>292</words>
From a rideshare idling outside, I catch a driver telling their fare, Breakups are weather reports, and I seed that sentence into the nearest cap. <words>317</words>
The ceiling maps shift, showing a corridor between Aries and an uncharted glyph, a hallway labeled Parting where footsteps refuse to echo. <words>339</words>
Out of that loud silence the storm releases its sibilants, not rain yet, more like fabric ripping beside the ear of a patient god. <words>363</words>
I archive the sounds patiently, categorizing their departures and arrivals, naming each with a stitch, a thimble, a lane of vanished footsteps. <words>385</words>
It occurs to me that the storm is literally figurative, a figure for everything leaving, but also a figure that literally presses against the dome. <words>410</words>
When I lift the last thimble, my mother's laugh resonates as a faint grit inside, as if storms stored her there for safekeeping. <words>433</words>
I do not trust magic, but I trust the categorized chorus, built from taxi confessions and star corridors, to guide the recording home. <words>456</words>
In this room, after memory became files, mysterious partings are how we meet, and my skeptical conjuring finally shelters something worth keeping. <words>478</words></story>
