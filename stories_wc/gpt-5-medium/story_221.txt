<story>Between the lines of a half-written letter to my father, I slid into the abandoned carnival shooting gallery like low tide entering a shipwrecked hull. <words>25</words>
I am a wreck-diver ghost whisperer, joyfully melancholic by constitution, hired by no one tonight except the ache that told me to step out of the shadow. <words>52</words>
In my pocket I kept a piece of amber with an insect inside, a warm teardrop I use to arouse memory in the dead the way divers stir silt. <words>81</words>
Every late October, my family keeps a tradition of attending the Silent Start, the night when we gather here to wait for the gallery's impossible first ping of a fallen target. <words>112</words>
This year they did not come, and between lines I had not yet written, their absences puckered the paper while the wind threaded BB holes like a bored calligrapher. <words>141</words>
My father was the county's legend, a marksman who could kiss a pellet off a bottle cap, and I was the one who listened instead, conversing with the ricochets. <words>170</words>
Tonight the thawing heart inside my ribs beat against the cold of his shadow, trying for once to make a noise louder than an echo. <words>195</words>
I set the amber on the dusty counter, breathed through my regulator out of habit, and whispered for the gallery ghosts to wake and guide my ungainly aim. <words>223</words>
The insect flickered as if alive in its honey prison, a compass needle gleefully mourning north, and silhouettes gathered, their carnival jackets smelling of rainwater and cordite. <words>250</words>
They told me the trick was not to aim, but to arouse the listening world, to make it want the ping as briefly and fiercely as I did. <words>278</words>
Our specific event once had fireworks, my great-grandmother's idea, an unruly rehearsal where the first pellet's ring signaled hugs, cider, and a vow to stay tender through winter. <words>306</words>
As the carnival rusted and the town forgot, our family kept attending together, dwindling each year, my presence a flick of fleeting rebellion against the legend that eclipsed me. <words>335</words>
I lifted the antique rifle, felt its grain like damp deck planks, and asked the insect to be brave with me; the ghosts hummed, joyfully melancholic. <words>361</words>
When I squeezed the trigger, the pellet found tin, the target tipped and chimed, and the thawing heart within me spilled its warmth into the drifting dust. <words>388</words>
Between the letter's lines, new words inked themselves, not apologies but directions, and for a breath I stepped out of the shadow, greeted by my father's stunned silence. <words>416</words>
I pocketed the amber, thanked the insect for courage, promised the ghosts we would still attend together, and walked into the fog feeling briefly enormous, joyfully melancholic, rebelliously mine. <words>445</words></story>
