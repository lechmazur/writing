<story>After the story famine, I lived in an ember alcove in mist. [12]
My hands, trained as a diligent orchestra copyist, still moved with measured devotion. [25]
I numbered rests and tied slurs for scores nobody played anymore. [36]
Yet the city asked me for a different notation, quiet as thistle fluff. [49]
It wanted dust to tell stories again, and I wanted to teach it. [62]
The rooms surrounding my alcove had burned to brick bones, warm as memory. [75]
Night fell with thistled calm, soft but barbed, as if warning against easy dreams. [89]
On the sill, the shortwave radio dial glow made a small lunar theater. [102]
In its circle, moths wrote jittery annotations while I copied silence into parts. [115]
Silence had measures too, but it needed phrasing, needed breath, needed stakes. [127]
So I tuned for a frequency rumored to slip between banded regulations. [139]
Old stagehands had whispered of a pirate broadcast that scored the fog. [151]
They said the songs carried grammar for ash and choreography for grit. [163]
If you heard the right verse, the soot began to articulate its weather. [176]
I drew my shawl close to cloak the glow, preserving darkness for listening. [189]
Needle-snow fell from the rafters, and the radio hissed like a teapot. [201]
Then a voice arrived sideways, as if translated by a wary hallway. [213]
No names, no station ID, just breaths and a pattern of tuned rain. [226]
The pirate broadcast stitched itself together via elusive song lyrics, teasing cadence from dust motes. [241]
Lines fell like sawdust, and the alcove brightened without heat, secretly luminous. [253]
Each refrain named a silence, and each silence offered a skeleton for telling. [266]
I copied the cadence onto onionskin, barlines as narrow as spider threads. [278]
Between measures, a cough from the transmitter shaped itself into a character. [290]
She was called Cinder, and she walked by feeling the temperature of words. [303]
Her world was a kiln, and to speak meant to hold clay steady. [316]
Cinder asked for a listener who could pace her, measure for measure. [328]
I answered by tapping pencil on the shelf, establishing common time in smolder. [341]
The voice noticed, and the next verse descended like scaffolding lowered through fog. [354]
It taught how to rake cinders into vowels, how to sift consonants from soot. [368]
I scattered ash over the page and blew; letters clung like shy seeds. [381]
My floor began to murmur, remembering footsteps as plot points and sighs as subtext. [395]
Shapes gathered along the walls, the kinds of silhouettes rehearsal rooms collect. [407]
They were scores I had copied, refusing to remain blank, asking for solos. [420]
But the broadcast cautioned me to pace, to give the dust its tempo. [433]
We are brittle voices, sang the lyrics, and breath is our hinge. [445]
I listened, cautious, the way a stand partner listens for a neighboring bow. [458]
Stories began to take shape in the carpet, curling from burns into letters. [471]
They wrote the day the hall cracked, the noon the conductor wept. [483]
They wrote the night the second violinist folded his chair into a boat. [496]
They wrote the absence of rain as if it were a stubborn motif. [509]
I kept copying, meticulous, because dust respects diligence and rewards exact measures. [521]
The pirate broadcast modulated, gentled, and then asked for payment in kind. [533]
Not coin, said the voice, but a promise to carry tempo forward. [545]
I promised to leave a score wherever ash settled, and to listen later. [558]
In return, the lyrics threaded a coda that would keep the glow hidden. [571]
They cloaked the shortwave radio dial glow under a paleness like breath on glass. [585]
Nobody outside the alcove would see my instrument, or sense its choir. [597]
But those who entered with thistled calm would feel the floor warming. [609]
They would watch dust lift into phrases, and phrases reach for cadence. [621]
Cinder visited then, a shadow on the wall, her outline a wavering notation. [634]
She thanked me for listening in a key between grief and timber. [646]
I thanked her for bringing the kiln's breath to this cold borough. [658]
The broadcast thinned, as if the fog itself ran out of harmonics. [670]
Before it faded, the voice left a cadence marker within my ribs. [682]
I would know when to begin again, and where to place the breath. [695]
Then the radio slept, its secretly luminous eye shuttered behind a chipped dial. [708]
I closed my ledger and swept the floor, careful not to erase drafting. [721]
The dust kept telling, now fluent, now shy, but always breathing measure. [733]
Outside, mist leaned against the brick, wearing the cloak of an unworried morning. [746]
Inside, I slept by ember light and dreamt my careful pages turning themselves. [759]
Even sleeping, I kept time, because stories deserve a conductor who listens first. [772]</story>
