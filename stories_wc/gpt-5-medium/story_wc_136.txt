<story>At midnight, I unfolded my maps against the cobblestones tonight. [10]
I am a meticulous route mapper, trained by lonely cartographers. [20]
They prized lines, but I prized the spaces between lines. [30]
My mentors called me analytically artistic, a compass with curiosity. [40]
Upon the hour that divides bad habits and new starts. [50]
Mist gathered, turning the square into a hesitant, listening room. [60]
Above me, the sky unlocked a starlit vault in mist. [70]
I felt trembling certainty, like a sketch trembling toward completion. [80]
The city answered with cracks in pavement forming arrows, direction. [90]
I traced them carefully, letting instinct sharpen every measured stride. [100]
I followed to find the fortress of unspoken truths ahead. [110]
Long ago, conductor left me a phantom train ticket punch. [120]
It pressed holes in silence, proof that absence leaves pattern. [130]
I kept it pocketed, a relic and a responsibility both. [140]
Tonight the arrows led to the old depot, roof scarred. [150]
Tracks ended abruptly, like sentences abandoned before the secret word. [160]
Fog pooled, and stars wavered in puddles like listening eyes. [170]
I raised the punch, and the night exhaled expectant breath. [180]
Each squeeze clipped circles from darkness, releasing faint clockwork clicks. [190]
The clicks gathered like rails, and rails gathered like promises. [200]
Then a whisper, edged with coal, offered me a dare. [210]
Find your fortress, but pay passage with patterns you understand. [220]
I answered by aligning the arrows, aligning my heartbeat too. [230]
I pressed the punch into air, and doors appeared humming. [240]
They opened onto a platform no timetable remembered or named. [250]
A train approached, its windows holding reflections without passengers, waiting. [260]
I stepped aboard, clutching maps inked with future corrections carefully. [270]
The carriage smelled of chalk, rain, and something like thunder. [280]
Seats unfolded like pages, offering margins to write new vows. [290]
A conductor made of smoke tipped an invisible cap solemnly. [300]
He carried no punch, because I carried the punch tonight. [310]
He asked my destination, and I answered with trembling certainty. [320]
Fortress of unspoken truths within starlit vault in mist awaits. [330]
He nodded, and the train began moving without mechanical motion. [340]
Windows revealed streets beneath, cracks in pavement forming arrows continuously. [350]
They pointed to memories where I avoided questions, turned away. [360]
They pointed to omissions drawn as gentle curves on maps. [370]
I was unraveling mysteries, starting with the cartographer behind me. [380]
My reflection leaned forward, a teacher liking riddles over lectures. [390]
He said map what you refuse to measure, measure gentler. [400]
I pressed holes again, this time in fear and habit. [410]
Dots appeared on my skinscape, constellations of avoided conversations everywhere. [420]
The train slowed as constellations resolved into ramparts of listening. [430]
We arrived before the fortress, whose stones breathed like animals. [440]
No gate stood there, only a mouth made by shadow. [450]
From the mouth issued echoes carrying my words unsent home. [460]
I stepped down, and the platform sank into gentle water. [470]
Stars bent lower, sealing the place like a sheltering lid. [480]
I dared the mouth to speak, and it answered honestly. [490]
It asked me to tender proof that I would listen. [500]
I laid maps down, routes sketched with measured, hesitant mercy. [510]
I laid the phantom train ticket punch upon them carefully. [520]
Silence accepted the offering, then pushed it back gently toward. [530]
You keep patterns, said the mouth, but they keep you. [540]
Unbutton them, and step through where lines resist closure softly. [550]
I folded the maps until they lost borders and expectations. [560]
I breathed, the way I sketch, analytically artistic and open. [570]
Patterns loosened, and arrows in pavement braided into invitations everywhere. [580]
I stepped forward, and the mouth widened into a corridor. [590]
Inside, rooms yawned, each shaped like a word unsaid before. [600]
I hung each unsaid word on the stars like lanterns. [610]
Light pooled, revealing faces I had disappointed, myself among them. [620]
I bowed to them, promising routes etched with kinder measures. [630]
The fortress murmured approval, and the train sighed homeward softly. [640]
When we emerged, the hour reset, and I began anew. [650]</story>
