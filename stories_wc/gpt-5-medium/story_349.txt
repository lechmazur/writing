I was a drone pilot lost in a medieval fantasy realm, guided only by ash-dark stars and the ruin-sweet smell of orchards. <words>22</words>
The abandoned observatory on a cliff had become my shelter, its domed eye blinded, its brass gears cooled into a charred serenity. <words>44</words>
From its balcony I watched villagers pace the orchard rows, calculating how many trunks to fell for siege engines at dawn. <words>65</words>
They moved during the hush before the orchard's trees are cut down, as if silence were the last fruit left to harvest. <words>87</words>
I was cynically hopeful, the way a crash survivor bargains with smoke, expecting failure yet craving the faint outline of rescue. <words>108</words>
Back home, my job had been to disseminate perspective, mapping horizons for farmers and firefighters, never guessing I would need to map horizons of mercy. <words>133</words>
The plan began with an encounter at a speed dating event hosted by the lonely guild of matchmakers in the market scriptorium. <words>155</words>
I sat across from a hedge-witch whose laugh clicked like cooling metal, and she slid me a dried herb bundle tied with copper thread. <words>179</words>
For three exchanged questions and a bell, she promised the bundle would smoke with memory, attracting anyone still listening for lost futures. <words>201</words>
We matched not for romance but for motive: to lure possibility from the brink of despair before the woodcutters woke their axes. <words>223</words>
So I invited every rival to the abandoned observatory on a cliff, promising timed conversations, rotating seats, and smoke to keep nerves steady. <words>246</words>
The orchard spirits came with bark-dark eyes; the carpenters came with chalked measures; the lord's reeve came with a ledger like a drawn sword. <words>270</words>
I burned the dried herb bundle in a brazen bowl, and the smoke climbed like a patient tide, smelling of rain on scorched wings. <words>294</words>
One by one, they took stations by the cracked lens, spoke for five minutes, then rotated, disseminating grievances giving way to inventories of tenderness. <words>318</words>
The hedge-witch timed the bells, I moderated, and the observatory's ribs held us like a kiln that hardens sorrow into usable silence. <words>340</words>
Through the huge window, night pressed against the cliff, but inside the talks widened, and I felt horizons of mercy adjust our eyes. <words>363</words>
A carpenter admitted the trees were kin once; a spirit offered sap for varnish; the reeve agreed the levy could rest a season. <words>386</words>
I told them I had flown machines that saw beyond walls, and they told me old domes teach the same: look longer than fear lasts. <words>411</words>
By first light, the orchard stood uncut, our voices leaving a soot-soft ring where blades might have bitten, a treaty drafted in charred serenity. <words>435</words>
I remained a drone pilot lost in a medieval fantasy realm, but now my compass pointed to possibility itself, alive and newly mutual. <words>458</words>
Somewhere behind us, axes slept, and the herb smoke thinned, yet the plan still ticked, a strange romance between strangers and the future. <words>481</words>
Our horizons held, circling together until despair grew dizzy and staggered backward, unable to find the cliff. <words>498</words>
