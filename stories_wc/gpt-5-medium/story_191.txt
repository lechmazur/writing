At the moment coffee cools in an abandoned mug, the mysterious island covered in mist behaves like a dealer palming cards from the sky. <words>24</words>
I find the sober cardsharp crouched by a driftwood table, his eyes boisterously quiet, counting waves instead of chips. <words>43</words>
He never smiles, yet I admit in grudging admiration that he notices everything the mist pretends to hide. <words>61</words>
Beside him rests an antique ink well, mottled bronze cradling black patience, a small moon waiting for a pen to rise. <words>82</words>
He claims its reservoir remembers wagers etched on tides, and that, if filled, it will write what the island owes. <words>102</words>
I ask why he is here, and he tells me he came to dare the unimaginable and collect a debt paid only in impossible odds. <words>127</words>
We listen to hushed pleas that seem to rise from the fog, as if the island itself were negotiating terms. <words>147</words>
I want to hasten the moment of revelation, but he taps the table, measuring time in the thinning steam of my cooling coffee. <words>170</words>
He works by analyzing cameo appearances in strangers' dreams, which he buys at card games where no cards are dealt and no sleepers wake. <words>194</words>
Last night he purchased a fragment of my own, a shoreline role where I handed him the ink well and told him not to trust the tide. <words>221</words>
He reads dreams like ledgers, and he says my warning was the only honest entry, so he asked me to watch him play the island. <words>246</words>
The match begins without rules, at the moment coffee cools in the abandoned mug on the table, a gong disguised as silence. <words>268</words>
Mist moves like shuffling, and the cardsharp lifts the antique ink well, dips a finger, and signs his name in air with patient black. <words>292</words>
The fog answers with boisterously quiet ripples, each ripple a face from a stranger's dream, arriving to watch their cameo settle accounts. <words>314</words>
He asks the island to cut, and he deals nothing; still, the spectators flinch when he names the hidden card, the breath they have hoarded. <words>339</words>
Hushed pleas flood the shore as if guilt itself were brine, offering secrets for the chance to fold without losing face. <words>360</words>
He refuses, insisting that risk must complete its orbit, and I feel that same grudging admiration stiffen in my throat like a dealt spine. <words>384</words>
Then he bets the ink well itself, wagering that the island cannot write its own debts without borrowing our hands. <words>404</words>
The mist hesitates, and every face looks to me, because in the dream I told him to refuse the shore's signature and I must confirm it. <words>430</words>
I nod, and he turns the table, showing the ocean its reflection, a dealer's mirror, and the island folds with a sigh like rain on slate. <words>456</words>
We win nothing except time, and he writes our receipt in the cooling rings, proof that daring the unimaginable sometimes pays in unspent ruin. <words>480</words>
When the mist thins, the coffee is cold, and he leaves me the ink well. <words>495</words>
