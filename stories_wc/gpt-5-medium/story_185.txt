<story>I arrived at the probability mapping center just before the sirens rehearsed another future. <words>14</words>
The peculiar collector awaited me there, infuriatingly calm, cataloging cracked vials of chance like fossils. <words>29</words>
They had worked across millennia without moving, or so the ledgers implied, each page a sedimented conjecture. <words>46</words>
I carried an old pencil stub, the kind that stains the fingers with stubborn graphite and unconfessed plans. <words>64</words>
The collector nodded at the stub as if recognizing a veteran, then slid a piano bench from beneath a console. <words>84</words>
Inside, not music but keys, ordinary door keys, lay in a grid whose negative spaces hummed. <words>100</words>
We would tweak the end of eras, the collector whispered, by decoding the arrangement of keys left in a piano bench. <words>121</words>
No algorithm could hear the quiet between the metals, but buried talents could. <words>134</words>
I asked why we should intervene instead of letting probabilities wash the world clean of our fingerprints. <words>151</words>
To make a final stand, the collector said, is simply to choose a melody and play it once. <words>169</words>
Their voice possessed fractured grace, each phrase cracking where tenderness met calculation. <words>181</words>
I set the old pencil stub between my teeth, tasting classroom dust, tasting the oath of unpopular answers. <words>199</words>
We hovered over the keys while clocks pulsed like fish beneath ice, the center mapping likelihoods in trembling lanes. <words>218</words>
The collector remained infuriatingly calm, arranging my hands as if setting cutlery for a compassionate autopsy. <words>234</words>
Strike this distance, they murmured, but spare the kindness; rethread the famine so it loosens without snapping. <words>251</words>
I traced coordinates in air; the benches, consoles, and floor tiles answered with dim tones of almosts. <words>268</words>
Every key corresponded to a lost promise, every blank to a quiet that might one day birth a law. <words>287</words>
We began decoding the arrangement of keys left in a piano bench, reassembling forgotten doorways from their echoing teeth. <words>306</words>
As patterns emerged, archived futures blinked open and closed like gulls, and I felt my buried talents waking. <words>324</words>
They were small: the talent to apologize without erasing, to hesitate without surrendering, to end things without violence. <words>342</words>
The collector offered a trembling smile and asked me to sign the margins where the map feared to speak. <words>361</words>
I wrote with the pencil stub until it became a crescent moon, and the room adjusted its tides. <words>379</words>
The future would not be saved, but it could be tuned; the collector let me tweak one sorrow. <words>397</words>
I chose the city that taught me silence, and lifted the hinge so its grief could exhale without choking. <words>416</words>
Some probabilities protested, snapping like brittle reeds, but most settled, redistributing storms into rain that gardens might survive. <words>434</words>
A lineage of thanks rose through the centuries like steam, touching faces I would never meet yet loved. <words>452</words>
The collector closed the bench, and the keys forgot us, which is how mercy keeps its color. <words>469</words>
Infuriatingly calm again, they walked away, leaving me the pencil stub and the terrible quiet of chosen outcomes. <words>487</words>
