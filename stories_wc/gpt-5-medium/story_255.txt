In the hush after a surprise party empties, I climb the abandoned control tower to watch confetti flutter like tired snow above the runway. <words>24</words>
I am a nondescript seer, more clipboard than crystal, and I prefer air traffic chatter to visions that demand adoration. <words>44</words>
Tonight the radios are quiet, yet my head swarms with a task I postponed for years, the fable I came to verify. <words>66</words>
I seek to unearth a mythic relic rumored to sleep beneath this tower, a rumored compass that points toward the most honest lie. <words>89</words>
That contradiction tastes right to me, because innocence needs its little helmets, and cynicism wears them until rain finally cleans the sweat. <words>111</words>
Delayed justice has rules, and one of them is patience with dust. <words>123</words>
I am analytically innovative, but not flashy, so I catalog the graffiti on the stairwell and map each arrow to the winds. <words>145</words>
Behind a peeling panel I find an encrypted usb drive wrapped with faded ribbons, a party favor from someone polite enough to vanish. <words>168</words>
The label reads for the tower that kept its secrets, which is either flattery or a warning disguised as applause. <words>188</words>
I know the encryption will not yield to brute logic, so I tune my small radio to static and wait for the world to change. <words>213</words>
When the first rain after a long drought drifts through the broken windows, the air smells like coins rinsed in lake water and old apologies. <words>238</words>
I work via that scent, letting it untangle years of grudges into flight paths, and the drive hums like a cleared runway at midnight. <words>262</words>
Files bloom open bearing photographs of a compass buried in concrete, its needle trembling toward a name scratched beneath the paint of the threshold. <words>286</words>
The name belongs to my mentor, the controller who taught me to keep altitude in a gossip storm and to smile like a grounded kite. <words>311</words>
He was blamed for the last crash here, and exiled gently, the kind of mercy that calls itself closure while tightening every bolt of silence. <words>336</words>
The files show sabotage orchestrated by a benefactor of the surprise party, a philanthropist whose donations swabbed truth until it could be filed as rumor. <words>361</words>
Innocent cynicism steadies me; I neither trust the philanthropist nor my nostalgia, but I believe a compass that trembles when lies pretend to be shelter. <words>386</words>
I pry up the threshold, find the relic nested in rebar and ash, and feel the needle tug toward the hangar where streamers still stick to the lights. <words>414</words>
Delayed justice is slow, but it arrives with a factual scent, and I follow that rain breath into the moonlit hangar to confront the donor. <words>439</words>
I set the compass on a table dotted with glitter, recite the names of the dead, and watch the needle point to the benefactor's seat. <words>464</words>
By morning, my report will untangle records, the drive will scatter its proofs, and the tower will smell less like sorrow and more like flying. <words>489</words>
