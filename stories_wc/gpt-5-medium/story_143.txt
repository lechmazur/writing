I am a fidgety mage-smith, hands twitching like trapped sparrows as the lavender field tucked behind rusted factory ruins breathes. <words>20</words>
It is the hour when only one star remains in a dimming sky, a timid pinprick guarding the horizon. <words>39</words>
I work to hold chaos at bay, though fear flutters inside me with a strangely joyful insistence. <words>56</words>
At my belt clacks a collection of keys on a ring, salvaged from doors that once led to assembly lines. <words>76</words>
Tonight I will remake the world in miniature via abandoned chalkboard notes, the last lesson scrawled by my vanished mentors. <words>96</words>
I am musically untalented, a cruel irony for spells that ask to be sung, so I forge rhythms with metal. <words>116</words>
Lavender stalks bow as if to an orchestra, and the rusted factory ruins answer with groans, my reluctant percussion. <words>135</words>
From a soot-black pouch, I pour the seeds of regrowth, each seed etched with a symbol like a tiny keyhole. <words>155</words>
The keys choose their mates among the seeds, clicking into place with delicate snicks that taste of ozone and promise. <words>175</words>
The chalkboard notes list permutations of earth, oil, grief, and breath; arrows loop like constellations across the ghosted equations. <words>194</words>
I strike the portable anvil, a battered drum, and hammer the notes into memory, letting sparks stand in for melody. <words>214</words>
Fearful joy rises, because creation is a corridor bounded by knives, and I must walk it without bleeding the field. <words>234</words>
Chaos waits beyond the horizon, a churning foundry of unmade days, eager to flood the valley with blankness and noise. <words>254</words>
I plant the keyed seeds between lavender rows, following the chalkboard's lattice, and whisper the unmelodic spell my hands can carry. <words>275</words>
The factory's heart, long seized, coughs once through a chimney rib, and dust motes align like clerks returning to duty. <words>295</words>
The lavender brightens, purple thickening to bruise-blue, and the seeds answer, cracking open with a hiss of miniature hinges. <words>314</words>
From each splits a filament of light that threads the ruined girders, and wherever it knots, iron remembers how to green. <words>335</words>
My keys ring against each other like nervous bells, a clatter keeping tempo, as if noise alone might herd reality. <words>355</words>
I cannot sing, but I can strike, twist, and file, reshaping silence into scaffolding strong enough to shoulder tomorrow. <words>374</words>
When the last key turns inside the last seed, a shiver passes through soil and sky, and the world remakes its breath. <words>396</words>
The lone star blinks approval, lavender sighs, and the ruins settle, held at bay as chaos recedes like a shuffled deck. <words>417</words>
I cradle the ring of keys and the smudged notes, trembling with fearful joy, because remaking is never clean, only necessary. <words>438</words>
Behind me the factory hushes to listen, ahead the field hums without music, and between them I keep the balance. <words>458</words>
