I am a broke aristocrat whose inheritance evaporates like mist, yet its weight presses with a legacy's burden. <words>18</words>
Tonight I stepped into the haunted amusement park, chasing rumors that the ghosts guard secret recipes older than kings. <words>37</words>
I was deciding to walk instead of drive, because engines startle spirits and shoes speak softly to abandoned boards. <words>56</words>
The roller coaster loomed like twin ribs, two parallel paths of time rattling out different futures in jittery sparks. <words>75</words>
Between those parallel paths hung a fog of blurry vividness, as if history breathed through a velvet shroud. <words>93</words>
I came to learn the secret recipes that made my family rich, the sauces and syrups my father squandered. <words>112</words>
My proof lay folded in my coat, a botanical illustration inked by an aunt who distilled gardens into drinkable constellations. <words>132</words>
The drawing showed vines that only bloom at closing time, their nectars rumored to harmonize mortal taste with patient ghosts. <words>152</words>
I called softly into the station, and the turnstile clicked an answer like a throat clearing before an ancestral confession. <words>172</words>
A realistically odd attendant appeared, face powdered with sawdust and moonlight, offering me a ticket stamped with our crest. <words>191</words>
He said the ride chooses riders who walk, because footsteps keep rhythm with missing heartbeats trapped in the rails. <words>210</words>
I boarded a car dressed in peeling roses, each petal etched with debts and signatures from creditors who felt like cousins. <words>231</words>
As the chain pulled, the twin tracks sang slightly apart, and my bones tried to harmonize the dreadful interval. <words>250</words>
On the left, the past flashed in sepia, where my mother traded recipes for jewels and never slept without candles. <words>270</words>
On the right, the future glittered cheaply, where I auctioned titles for rent and wore hunger like a tailored scarf. <words>290</words>
Between these paths I glimpsed a kitchen built into the sky, stoves flickering with carnival bulbs, pans swirling like planets. <words>310</words>
Ghostly chefs leaned over me, whispering measurements, leaf by leaf, flame by flame, if I promised to carry their burden faithfully. <words>331</words>
I agreed, though my voice cracked, and the coaster plunged through dark where salt tasted like coins and thyme like thunder. <words>352</words>
We slowed beside a maintenance platform, where jars floated as if tethered by breath, and I laid down the illustration. <words>372</words>
The ink vines uncoiled, climbed the safety rail, and drew from the jars a perfume that made shadows confess their heat. <words>393</words>
The attendants hummed, and the two tracks finally aligned, letting the recipes harmonize with my pulse. <words>409</words>
I stepped off with pockets smelling of rain and rosemary, the legacy's burden lighter and also impossibly precise. <words>427</words>
I kept walking into dawn, the realistically odd night already fading, yet its blurry vividness kept my hunger honest. <words>446</words>
Every step wrote a recipe in air, and somewhere behind me the coaster sighed, relieved to share its secret. <words>465</words>
I realized legacy is a kitchen between parallel paths, and tonight I finally learned to set the table. <words>483</words>
