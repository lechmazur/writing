<story>
In the underground city of the goblins, a meek necromancer walked softly beneath roots and pipes. <words>16</words>
He was peculiarly sincere, even when speaking to bones or pigeons lost from the surface. <words>31</words>
The market hummed amid playground sounds spilling from the spiral courtyards where goblin children chased copper hoops. <words>48</words>
He carried a fountain pen with a broken nib, tucked like a contrite secret inside his sleeve. <words>65</words>
With it he wrote agreements between the living and the politely restless, and never charged more than a loaf. <words>84</words>
Yet his heart leaned to one task alone: to decode a universal riddle. <words>97</words>
He believed the answer would help the dead and the living regain a gentler grammar. <words>112</words>
Old maps spoke of the tangled tapestry, a web of meanings stitched beneath the bazaars and tunnels. <words>129</words>
They said the tapestry could be read only through the way light reflects off a dew drop. <words>146</words>
So the necromancer carried a tiny vial of morning, harvested from vents where the world above exhaled. <words>163</words>
Each dawn, he uncorked it near the market lamps and let a single dew drop rest on his palm. <words>182</words>
Goblins paused, laughing softly, because the meek necromancer made miracles look like ordinary chores. <words>196</words>
He watched reflections flicker across the broken nib, then skitter over the cobbles toward a mural of roots. <words>214</words>
Lines brightened where the echoes of children curved, and words arranged themselves like shy moths landing. <words>230</words>
He wrote them down with his ruined pen, apologizing to the page for every scratch. <words>245</words>
The phrases were humble, but they fitted together as if the world had been waiting for manners. <words>262</words>
A skull salesman offered tea, and asked what prize he sought inside the tapestry of thunder and dust. <words>280</words>
The necromancer bowed and answered that he hoped to regain the first tone by which kindness recognizes itself. <words>298</words>
The salesman nodded, for even goblins know the city is built on sounds that promise shelter. <words>314</words>
At last the dew drop trembled, and the reflection shaped a small sentence upon the mural. <words>330</words>
It said, Carry every name as if it were your own, and let your shadow teach your hands. <words>348</words>
The necromancer felt the market hush amid playground sounds, and something evergreen moved inside his ribs. <words>364</words>
He thanked the mural, the dew, the children, the tea, and the bones, all in one breath. <words>381</words>
Then he returned to his stall and began scribing agreements that let quarrels rest without winning or losing. <words>399</words>
The universal riddle felt smaller, like a door already opening inward. <words>410</words>
