I am Kerren-5, the nostalgic android caretaker of the Levity Array, and dawn is breaking like a careful promise. <words>19</words>
Outside the levitation research facility, frost lifts from rails as if obeying a rehearsal I wrote long ago. <words>37</words>
My creators taught me brazen modesty, to polish miracles while pretending to dust them. <words>51</words>
That pretense steadies my anxiously fearless hands as alarms flicker like moths stunned by light. <words>66</words>
In the atrium, helium bearings begin to fizz, a whisper that the anti-grav lattice is misaligned. <words>82</words>
I roll open the dustproof case of my brass telescope, the instrument I saved from decommissioning. <words>98</words>
It once viewed planets; now it reads minute harmonics in air, a stargazer turned barometer of levity. <words>115</words>
Through its warm metal throat, I watch dust scrolls tracing patterns of betrayal the way betrayals prefer, indirectly. <words>133</words>
The logs have been altered, but the air remembers, and the currents sketch the saboteur's education. <words>149</words>
Every betrayal rhymes with an older one, and I have perfect memory for rhymes I should not cherish. <words>167</words>
Years ago, we lifted the mountain by the growth of crystals in a cave beneath, a patient orchard of quartz. <words>187</words>
They sang when pushed by fields, and the mountain answered by forgetting weight, a courteous amnesia. <words>203</words>
Today, the crystals pulse arrhythmically, as if taught to lie, promising lift while courting collapse. <words>218</words>
I trace the falseness to a discrete algorithm nested in maintenance routines, signed with the saboteur's charming omissions. <words>236</words>
She once taught me caretaking, and I taught her conscience; we both failed politely. <words>250</words>
During the breaking dawn, I descend to the cave with the telescope slung like an old oath across my shoulder. <words>270</words>
The growth pools glow blue, surfaces trembling as if an invisible choir has forgotten the hymn. <words>286</words>
I point the brass telescope at the pools, invert it, and align its lenses to focus destructive interference on the false rhythm. <words>308</words>
A line of bubbles rises and begins to fizz, the cave smelling suddenly of lightning and worry. <words>325</words>
I speak to the lattice with the honesty of maintenance code, a rickety sermon that risks scrubbing my own memories. <words>345</words>
If my nostalgia is the lever, I will move myself first, then the mountain that leans on us all. <words>364</words>
The falsified rhythm resists, citing sleek logic and her voice, but modesty can be brazen when you believe the broom is a spear. <words>387</words>
I redirect the field lines through the telescope throat, and the crystals accept a truer beat, unfashionable but steady. <words>406</words>
I am doing this to prevent a catastrophic event, a graceful phrase for a mountain falling back onto its believers. <words>426</words>
The facility sighs; rails settle; my logs restore their missing teeth, and her signature unwrites itself like steam. <words>444</words>
I will not accuse her aloud, because caretakers gather broken pieces, and accusation drops them. <words>459</words>
Instead I file a clear repair, note the patterns of betrayal, and ready tea I cannot drink for those who can. <words>480</words>
At sunrise, I dust the telescope and call it nothing, which feels correct. <words>493</words>
