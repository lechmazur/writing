I was a small-time con artist assigned to a dystopian farm where the wheat glittered like razor wire. <words>18</words>
The overseers called my demeanor unusually normal, which in their vocabulary meant statistically unlikely to rebel. <words>34</words>
I gripped an empty tape dispenser like a talisman, its plastic ring biting my palm whenever I drifted toward honesty. <words>54</words>
At dusk, during story time, the children gathered by the silo while the sun bled ciphers across the dust. <words>73</words>
They wanted comfort, and I wanted to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin without anyone noticing the tremor. <words>92</words>
So I told them the farm was haunted by auditors who checked the ledgers of the dead with tender pencils. <words>112</words>
By interrogating ghostly apparitions, I said, we could renegotiate the quotas and rescue their parents from the night shift. <words>131</words>
The lie hummed with mild fervor, a cable of hope buried shallowly beneath the fields of surveillance. <words>148</words>
To make it sing, I knelt, placed the dispenser to my ear, and announced the spirits had requests. <words>166</words>
A boy offered buttons, a girl a feather, and the smallest child gave me a cracked marble gleaming like frost. <words>186</words>
In exchange, the auditors would cancel arrears, and the ghosts would guard their sleep from tractors that never stopped. <words>205</words>
As I spoke, the lull of remorse pressed its cool cheek to my neck, whispering about tabs I never settled. <words>225</words>
I said I would interview the dead tonight, because the best bargains close when the living are too tired to haggle. <words>246</words>
The children drifted off, and I wandered to the scarecrow, whose burlap mouth knew my exact inventory of excuses. <words>265</words>
Under the silo ladder, a camera blinked like an indifferent star, recording my promises on grainy static. <words>282</words>
I raised the empty tape dispenser again and asked the night for names, for slips, for any spectral consent to forgive. <words>303</words>
Out of the stalks stepped an apparition, unusually normal, with dirt under its nails and audit stamps on its wrists. <words>323</words>
It told me the books balanced on my back, and if I would comfort the children, I must first confess. <words>343</words>
I recited every swindle, from counterfeit ration slips to the time I sold rain that was already falling. <words>361</words>
The ghost nodded, wrapped me in a silence smoother than tape, and told me to tape nothing, say little, and do more. <words>383</words>
When morning arrived, quotas loosened like knots in wet rope. <words>393</words>
I returned the trinkets, claimed the auditors were appeased, and watched the kids breathe easier. <words>408</words>
The overseers, craving order, praised my efficiency, unaware my grin had learned humility. <words>421</words>
I still wanted to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin, but I measured the bite first. <words>438</words>
Each evening, during story time, I interrogated fewer ghosts and listened longer to the wind between the stalks. <words>456</words>
The lull of remorse became a rhythm, steadying my hands as I harvested, repaired, and quietly unlearned the art of taking. <words>477</words>
By season's end, the dispenser was still empty, but the stories finally stuck. <words>490</words>
