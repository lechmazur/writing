In the utopia design studio, I worked as a bard who refused the stage, writing blueprints in meter and hush. <words>20</words>
Our mandate was radiant and practical: before the birth of a new star, model a city that could remember celebration. <words>40</words>
I, romantically doomed as any traveling singer, loved the lead architect whose palms mapped avenues like constellations. <words>57</words>
She shone, and I practiced evading the spotlight that poured across drafting tables like a relentless noon. <words>74</words>
My desk held a collection of old keys, not for doors, but for ideas locked inside disused tools. <words>92</words>
Each key matched a forgotten jig, a spindle, a loom, a matrix of craft techniques the city would need. <words>111</words>
To preserve them, I composed manuals in ballad form, raucously silent songs meant to be read by calloused fingers. <words>130</words>
At dusk, the studio emptied, and our drafts throbbed with a tone of forgotten revelry that sobered our hope. <words>149</words>
Then, by the echo of a bell in a distant tower, I would calibrate silence and elicit the room's reply. <words>169</words>
The echo mapped imperfections: a resonant beam here, a whispering corner there, a place where laughter would pool. <words>187</words>
She found me listening and called it superstition, but her eyes softened when the blueprints adjusted to such listening. <words>206</words>
We never kissed; we placed sample tiles together, and sometimes our wrists touched, two compasses trying not to align. <words>225</words>
She belonged to acclaim, a comet in committee chambers, while I kept to shadowed benches and the muteness of making. <words>245</words>
Evading the spotlight let the keys speak; they clicked histories into the locks of apprentice hearts, refusing spectacle's glare. <words>264</words>
When funding waned, I staged a demonstration that appeared like idleness: a workshop so quiet it thundered. <words>281</words>
The investors, perplexed, felt the raucously silent chorus of hands and tools, and asked what music had conducted them. <words>300</words>
I answered that the city would be scored by touch, and that luxury was the persistence of craft. <words>318</words>
The bell tolled again, remote lightning without storm, and the tower's echo drew their pulses into the plan's cadence. <words>337</words>
She smiled at me publicly, a benediction I could not keep, and approved the archives I unlocked for everyone. <words>356</words>
I understood then that my romance was to the work, to the keys, to the echo that kept applause at bay. <words>377</words>
On the final night before the star's ignition, I sealed our manuals with wax impressed by the oldest key's teeth. <words>397</words>
I left them in a drawer labeled Restraint, so that future revelers could find their echoes without choking on applause. <words>417</words>
When she departed to bless the new star's bloom, I stayed, guarding the studio's night with a gentle refusal to shine. <words>438</words>
The city-to-be waited like a held breath, and my songs waited too, folded among blueprints like sleeping swallows. <words>456</words>
I listened for the distant bell once more, to elicit a future where hands teach hands while the spotlight hunts elsewhere. <words>477</words>
