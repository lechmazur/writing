Snowmelt dripped from the cedar eaves as I arrived at the strange attractor laboratory. <words>14</words>
Its machines wore a patina of rustic refinement, brass dials sober as old choirboys, cords braided like winter rye. <words>33</words>
I had been summoned, a mild zealot of pattern and mercy, to audit equations that hummed like threshers. <words>51</words>
The institute lived between shifting powers, funded by ministries that traded hands as quickly as thunderstorms. <words>67</words>
On my desk waited a cedar box, oddly typical yet whispering like a creek under ice. <words>83</words>
Inside lay a collection of foreign paper money, crisp with countries that no longer existed, faces blurred by thumbwork. <words>102</words>
Each note bore the scars of legacy, coffee rings, tear tracks, and a faint smell of spent incense. <words>120</words>
Professor Harrow explained that the box was our primer, a way to visualize the attractor itself through forgotten wishes. <words>139</words>
Money remembers, he said, and memory shapes the curve where repetitions settle into fate. <words>153</words>
We sorted the notes by portraits, then by stains, then by the temperature of their crinkle, listening for a hidden meter. <words>174</words>
I felt both foolish and reverent, an auditor of flukes chasing arithmetic in the footfalls of kings. <words>191</words>
Harrow called me his conscience because my zeal was mild, my questions persistent, my hands clean from the budgets I flagged. <words>212</words>
But the attractor took its position anyway, chalk spirals on the slate blooming like seed patterns in sunflower heads. <words>231</words>
We tuned the gyroscopes by the face of a queen whose teeth were penciled in, and the graphs calmed like oxen. <words>252</words>
Then the funding ministry changed again, and Harrow asked how much we would give to keep the field from collapsing. <words>272</words>
His question was not about salaries or grants, but about the lives pressed into those banknotes like leaves under windowglass. <words>292</words>
Through them I saw a farmer who traded a bright bill for a darker favor, and a nurse who bartered for silence. <words>314</words>
Their wishes, forgotten by their own mouths, still tugged at the equations like minnows worrying a rope. <words>331</words>
I understood then that our work asked for sacrifice, not of blood, but of certainty, the costly comfort of believing ourselves exempt. <words>353</words>
To learn the true meaning of sacrifice, I carried the queen's note to the chalkboard and tore it into a spiral template. <words>375</words>
The attractor responded, tightening, as if the paper knew the curve it had always yearned to complete. <words>392</words>
Harrow smiled with a tired joy, and outside the eaves the meltwater kept time for a future we had finally earned the right to enter. <words>417</words>
