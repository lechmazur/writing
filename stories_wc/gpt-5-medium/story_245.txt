<story>
I jog laps around the abandoned spaceport flight deck, lungs stinging like scrapped metal in a winter hangar. <words>18</words>
An irate smuggler, I keep moving because stillness summons past cargo and worse, the promises I never delivered. <words>36</words>
My motive today is ridiculous and holy: to find hidden waterfalls rumored to roar beneath the starship scrapyards. <words>54</words>
I carry a thermos of spiced tea, because directions here must be read through patterns in tea leaves. <words>72</words>
The leaves settle during each corner of my jog, drawing maps no sanctioned chart would dare admit exists. <words>90</words>
I stir with a single chopstick stolen from a diplomat's mess kit, the lone survivor of past etiquette. <words>108</words>
Its varnish is nicked like my record, and its balance steadies my breathing better than any metronome. <words>125</words>
Every lap, the deck yawns in echoing ribs, concrete and obsolete cordage thrumming with the station's abstractly physical ghosts. <words>144</words>
They say the heart's revolt begins as a whispering tremor, and mine now pounds open mutiny against profit and flight. <words>164</words>
Waterfalls, if they exist, will drown the ledger that ruled my veins and baptize me into something unlisted. <words>182</words>
Biting sincerity tastes metallic in my mouth; I have lied for years, but this oath scalds honestly. <words>199</words>
I memorialize the dead routes with each stride, tapping the chopstick against my thermos as a semaphore of goodbye. <words>218</words>
Steam blesses the cold air, becomes script, becomes topography, becomes prayer, the leaves insisting on a hatch near Bay Twelve. <words>238</words>
I check the deck plates while jogging, no pause, breath counting truth, until the faded number twelve limps into view. <words>258</words>
Beneath it, a grille snarls, hot with wind from below, air wet like held-back tears inside a sealed freighter. <words>277</words>
The chopstick slots a stubborn latch, and the panel exhales with the humility of a long smuggled confession. <words>295</words>
I drop through, landing on a maintenance stair that spirals toward a roar too rhythmic to be machinery. <words>313</words>
Running still, because vows decay if I stop, I chase the sound as the tea rattles like nervous bones. <words>332</words>
The tunnel opens into a cavern of fractured hull and sunlight, where water leaps down in braids, extravagant, impossible, undeniable. <words>352</words>
I kneel, suddenly calm, the heart's revolt settling into governance, a new law enforced by spray and echo. <words>370</words>
To prove I am present, I memorialize each name I've used, speaking them into foam until they dissolve into silence. <words>390</words>
The chopstick floats beside me like a needle freed of thread, pointing downstream, counseling mercy neither court nor cartel taught. <words>410</words>
I drink the last lukewarm tea, and the leaves finally show no pattern, just a blank, beautiful horizon. <words>428</words>
Sometimes a map exists only until you arrive, and sincerity becomes function, muscle, an abstractly physical compass beating behind the ribs. <words>449</words>
I start jogging again along the wet stone, water clapping time, the spaceport above receding like a used alias. <words>468</words>
When I turn back, it will be to smuggle only breath, to traffic only hope, to pay all debts in waterfalls. <words>489</words>
