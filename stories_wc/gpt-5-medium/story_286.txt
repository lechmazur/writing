After the last human law is broken, I arrive at the nanobotanical garden with an apology stitched into breath. <words>19</words>
I am a professional apologizer, wildly reserved, hired to translate wreckage into relief without pretending the wreckage did not happen. <words>39</words>
Even here, under glass that grows like dew, the job is to nuance grief until it can finally breathe. <words>58</words>
The garden is a whispering engine, roots of programmed pollen indexing the seasons we no longer legislate but still feel. <words>78</words>
I am elated fatigue wrapped in a coat of formal contrition, a pulse laughing and limping at once. <words>96</words>
My client is the city itself, which cannot stop humming the echoes of authenticity it buried beneath orderly myths. <words>115</words>
Payment will be granted by unlocking city folklore on bar napkins, where ink remembers the real names of winds. <words>134</words>
I carry a piece of a broken vinyl record, the shard I apologize with when language forgets how to hold a throat. <words>156</words>
Its groove has the weather of a protest, and its edge plays the tremble that makes confessions grow seeds. <words>175</words>
To map seasonal changes, I trace the nanoflowers as they rewrite themselves, and I apologize to each revision. <words>193</words>
I tell spring sorry for arriving as patches, summer sorry for heat without holidays, autumn sorry for reds that mean fire drills. <words>215</words>
Winter receives my deepest bow, because its shutdowns saved the last weeds of humility from algorithms that wanted applause. <words>234</words>
The plants answer in microclimates, growing enough shade to invite the wanderers who now sleep where courtrooms stood. <words>252</words>
They bring me napkins stained with folklore, each square a map to forgotten winters, each ring a radius of confession. <words>272</words>
Reading them, I nuance my apologies, tuning tone, thinning volume, brightening vowels until the garden lets my voice through. <words>291</words>
A child with soot on his cheeks asks why I am sorry, and I tell him because truth arrived late. <words>311</words>
He nods and gives me a napkin diagram of a kite, noting the day the wind resigned from employment. <words>330</words>
I tuck the vinyl shard into my palm and cross the pond of programmable lilies, their petals pulsing like tiny lungs. <words>351</words>
There, on a bench grown from mossed steel, I offer the garden a final apology for laws that confused order with care. <words>373</words>
The shard sings, and the echoes of authenticity come back as weather, a chart of rains rewritten by ungoverned bees. <words>393</words>
I map the seasonal changes onto the napkins, ink bleeding into routes the city can finally walk without apology. <words>412</words>
Then I sleep on the warm glass, wildly reserved even in dreaming, elated fatigue settling like pollen on my tongue. <words>432</words>
When I wake, the garden has learned to apologize for me, and the city answers by unlocking brighter folklore. <words>451</words>
