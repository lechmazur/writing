<story>Silence puddled in the futuristic hospital ward as the red balloon escaped a child's fingers and drifted toward the sterilized skylight, leaving prayers unsaid. <words>24</words>
I am a perceptive cartographer without a map, tracing latitude across polished floors, reading longitude in the long breaths machines take when no one watches. <words>49</words>
The hush after the balloon slips is my hourglass, a slowed cosmos in which bearings can be drawn before grief hardens into the bureaucracy of care. <words>75</words>
To find my place in the universe, I follow a sound no chart predicted, the rhythmic clang that should not exist beneath hermetic floors and whispering vents. <words>102</words>
It is the secret heartbeat of a hidden blacksmith's forge, out of century and out of code, ringing like coordinates struck on an anvil of oxygen. <words>128</words>
I trail it past nurses with distantly intimate smiles, their eyes trained to cradle distance without touching, their hands correcting the invisible drift of lines. <words>153</words>
The clang guides me through a maintenance door that opens like a mouth remembering a password, and the air turns heavier, old as soot, salted with memory. <words>180</words>
In the sublevel, a figure hammers prosthetic bones while holograms flutter, and I think of my father, who pressed a dragonfly between dictionary pages to teach stillness. <words>207</words>
He said the world names you before you can answer, and maps are how you convince it otherwise, if you venture far enough to redraw the lines. <words>234</words>
But he died on a ward like this, under lights that never blinked, while I traced routes from bed to window and learned how innocence corrodes on contact with protocol. <words>264</words>
That day, the balloon escaped too, and I pressed the dictionary closed to save the dragonfly, realizing the wings were already dust, and saving meant naming the loss precisely. <words>293</words>
Now, I watch the blacksmith shape a knee that will never kneel, and I ask who ordered iron in a place sworn to softness. <words>317</words>
She says the hospital commissions her to repair what war and market perfected, that hope requires fittings, and that healing is simply precision delivered with clean gloves. <words>344</words>
I tell her I am here to be convinced, not by policy, but by the map her hammer is making in my ribs, a topography of necessary noise. <words>372</words>
The balloon threads the air above us, lost to the ductwork, and its soft orbit reminds me that distance can be tender without lying, and closeness can harm without meaning to. <words>403</words>
So I ask the blacksmith to carve coordinates into the inside of the knee, my father's initials beside mine, a secret atlas for the body's future pilgrim. <words>430</words>
She hesitates, then nods, and in that distantly intimate accord I find my place, not beyond the skylight but inside the clang, where innocence is tempered into compass. <words>458</words></story>
