<story>After the resuscitation, the midway smelled like rain rolled in mothballs and gasoline. [13]
I woke under a shroud of tarps, ribs clicking, while a whispering advisor leaned into my ear. [30]
His breath had that repulsive allure of sweet rot, like carnival taffy left under a tongue too long. [48]
Get up, he murmured, they have kept the lights burning without power, a lingering luminance that refuses to die. [67]
He meant the abandoned carnival funhouse, hulking beyond the ferris skeleton like a dead whale nursing a glow. [85]
I stood because my chest still ticked, because the world had bargained me back for something unnamed. [102]
He pressed a small metal curve into my palm, an opera cloak clasp scavenged from the illusionist's coat. [120]
You will need this to open the laughing mouth, he whispered, and you will need to lie. [137]
I asked why I was not dead, and he chuckled like paper tearing very slowly. [152]
Because I hauled you back by the throat of your fear, he said, and fear owes me money. [170]
He was my whispering advisor, or I was his puppet, and either way our bargain rasped. [186]
Inside the funhouse, the bulbs glowed like bruises, each mirror giving back a face I did not recognize. [204]
I am photographically cursed, I told him, and the mirrors know it and make new negatives of me. [222]
Every picture of me grows meat where there was shadow, memory where there was dust. [237]
He said that made me useful, because we had come to trick fear into revealing its weakness. [254]
The plan was not speech but method, and it would be done through paradoxical notes in a dream dictionary. [273]
My grandmother kept it in a bread tin, a lexicon of sleeping symbols that smelled like stove gas. [291]
The advisor had filled the margins with instructions that contradicted themselves until they circled a trap. [307]
Write that a door means open when closed, he whispered, and closed when open, then fold it inside a photograph. [327]
Fear covets rules, he said, but loathes paradox, and in loathing it blurts its secrets like bile. [344]
We reached the plywood lips with rusted hinges, a yawning grin starved of grease and laughter. [360]
I pinched the opera cloak clasp into a ribbon of wire and fed it into the lock like a trick coin. [381]
Something inside clicked, savoring my trespass, and the mouth slid apart with a wet-sounding sigh. [396]
The first corridor was striped with the lingering luminance of dead fluorescents, their afterglow crawling like algae. [413]
My eyes watered, and every tear showed me another angle of myself losing a bet. [428]
We set the dream dictionary on a wobbling clown pedestal and opened it to the letter D. [445]
D is for door, I wrote, and also for do not enter, and for do not look back until you do. [466]
The wink of contradiction made the page breathe like a gill, and the funhouse breathed with it. [483]
I unbosomed the truth I had smuggled through the blackout, laying it beside the ink in small coins. [501]
I am afraid that I do not exist unless someone is looking, I said, and their look edits me. [520]
The mirrors hummed approval, and my whispering advisor pulled the shutter on his antique camera. [535]
He aimed it at the dictionary, not me, and took a picture of the contradiction birthing itself. [552]
The film quivered like meat, as if the photographically cursed part of me had smeared along the emulsion. [570]
A hiss answered from deeper inside, not wind but the breath of something that survived on my edits. [588]
Come out, I called, we have rules for you, and I promise they will never agree. [604]
The corridor spit up the shape of a shadow with eyes but not the faucets to drain them. [622]
It read the page aloud in a voice like carnival bark peeled wrong, and it gagged on the word door. [642]
What do you want, it asked, already slick with resentment, and my advisor bent nearer than blood. [659]
To trick fear into revealing its weakness, I said, and you will show it by surviving your own dilemma. [678]
The shadow tried to split but could not agree with itself, and in that stutter it bled nouns. [696]
It confessed that a real gaze sutures it shut, that unswerving attention is the solvent it fears. [713]
So we aimed the camera not at me but at it, and we did not blink when the flash came. [733]
The lingering luminance wrapped it like old milk, and my name swam back into my face. [749]
By then, the mouth of the house had sealed behind us, but the clasp in my hand remembered the trick. [769]
I fed it into another lock and felt the mechanism swallow like a patient forgiving a doctor. [786]
We left through a slit of daylight disguised as a crack in painted night. [800]</story>
