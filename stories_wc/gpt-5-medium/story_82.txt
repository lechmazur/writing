In the hush of a hidden sunrise, I walk the rows of my cursed orchard and wish the trees would stop remembering. <words>22</words>
I am the reluctant caretaker of this place, drafted by blood, bound by something older than the drones over the futuristic hub. <words>44</words>
The pears hum, the plums twitch like eyelids, and every leaf rehearses gossip from centuries that never learned to die. <words>64</words>
Gleeful sorrow is the only weather that ever fits here, and I wear it like a coat with secret inner pockets. <words>85</words>
Analytically playful, I coax the orchard to talk, setting riddles in baskets and recording the punchlines that arrive as rustling. <words>105</words>
I want to become the voice of the unknown, not its echo, so I catalog every tremor, stain, and half-born fruit joke. <words>127</words>
The orchard keeps secrets in the farmhouses slumping along the boundary, where wallpaper peels like scabbed maps and doors creak confessions. <words>148</words>
I grip a rusted latch, smiling despite the smell, because unraveling mysteries loves a stage, and rot is an honest theater. <words>169</words>
By unlocking secrets in rotting farmhouses, I translate the orchard's language into something the city can heed without cages or sirens. <words>190</words>
One ledger maps wormholes of gossip to a cave behind the canals, where an antique chill answers questions with mineral patience. <words>211</words>
There I find a fossilized dragon tooth (found in a cave), heavy as debt, gleaming with a promise the orchard begged me to hear. <words>235</words>
The tooth thrums when I press it to bark, and the trees answer with images of droughts, starfreight delays, and a child who vanished laughing. <words>260</words>
In the city core, the futuristic hub wears its glass like armor, yet its algorithms consult fruit prices more faithfully than missing persons. <words>283</words>
I return before noon, still within morning's shadow, and stage a trial between tooth and trunk, asking questions in a courtroom of bees. <words>306</words>
Their verdict arrives as a direction, pointing to a farmhouse whose cellar door hides a stair that was never supposed to be counted. <words>329</words>
I descend, analytically playful again, inventorying shadows, and I grip the rail as if it were a throat clearing before testimony. <words>350</words>
A chamber opens, lined with crate wood and orchard roots, where the child's laughter continues, now braided with the groan of slow machinery. <words>373</words>
The dragon tooth warms, and a projector coughs light that sketches contracts between settlers and trees, signatures made with sap and breath. <words>395</words>
The orchard was cursed to remember until a caretaker spoke, not for it, but with it, naming each silence as a citizen. <words>417</words>
I carry the tooth to the hub and broadcast the records, my voice cracking with gleeful sorrow as markets pause and the missing child arrives. <words>442</words>
The trees release their hum into words, the contracts dissolve, and the orchard finally rests, while I begin translating everything else the city refuses to hear. <words>468</words>
In the hush after triumph, I file the tooth and the laughter, promising to keep unraveling mysteries until silence itself learns how to answer. <words>492</words>
