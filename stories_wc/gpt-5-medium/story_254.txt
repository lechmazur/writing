<story>I am a humorless comedic actor rehearsing where applause is extinct. <words>11</words>
The stage tonight is a deserted playground at the edge of a wilderness. <words>24</words>
Swings creak like questions no one intends to answer. <words>33</words>
I warm up by naming my unwanted gifts, because each one insists on rewriting me. <words>48</words>
They arrive wrapped in silence and obligation, signed by fate with a smirk I cannot mimic. <words>64</words>
Most are objectively personal, a paradox that feels like a mirror weighing more than I do. <words>80</words>
One gift is an inkwell, dried out, from a director who told me to improvise with my blood. <words>98</words>
Another is a jar that claims it can bottle a star's dying breath, but only once. <words>114</words>
I keep both under the slide, next to the sandbox fossils and the long shadow of the moon. <words>132</words>
My motive for accepting these gifts is simple and impossible. <words>142</words>
I want to bottle a star's dying breath and finally learn a punchline that dignifies silence. <words>158</words>
The method suggested by night is to practice through persistent daydream loops until the cosmos laughs. <words>174</words>
So I pace the merry-go-round, counting bolts like beats, letting my mind spin while my face stays still. <words>192</words>
Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry, I confess routines I never dared perform. <words>206</words>
Jokes become prayers, setups become compass points, and my refusal to grin becomes a vow. <words>221</words>
There is an audience of owls, their amber eyes leaving notes on the air. <words>235</words>
They seem to concede that solemnity can be a kind of courage. <words>247</words>
I take the jar and I take the inkwell, dried out, and I sit inside the broken carousel horse. <words>266</words>
I imagine the star breathing, a last tiny storm folding into glass, and I see myself finally exhale. <words>284</words>
But the daydream loops are stubborn; they reset me at the moment before mercy. <words>298</words>
The jar will not fill while I am pretending, and my blood will not flow for applause. <words>315</words>
I must concede a private truth that is objectively personal and therefore bulletproof against fashion. <words>330</words>
I do not tell jokes; I release archived silences, carefully timed, so they land gently. <words>345</words>
The owls blink, and the swings quit asking, and the night bends to hear me breathe. <words>361</words>
I open the jar and invite the star to choose me without spectacle or pity. <words>376</words>
A filament of frost drifts in, quieter than laughter, heavier than grief, and the glass trembles. <words>392</words>
The inkwell, dried out, suddenly remembers rain, and a single black tear offers itself like ink. <words>408</words>
I write the breath onto the wind with that tear, not for critics, not for rescue, only for the hush. <words>428</words>
It answers by settling in the jar, a soft starless syllable agreeing to be kept. <words>443</words>
I do not smile, but I feel found, as if the wilderness has accepted my strict face as passport. <words>462</words>
These unwanted gifts were emissaries, and I finally understood their punchline. <words>473</words>
What we keep keeps us, through persistent daydream loops, through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry. <words>489</words></story>
