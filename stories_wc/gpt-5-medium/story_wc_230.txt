<story>The storms had planed the ravine to a grim bowl, and our hanging orchard creaked like a chandelier strung between cliffs after the empathy virus. [25]
I was a rational truffle forager there, with a scale and a patience that could measure the way fear hid beneath wet leaves. [48]
Truth followed me like the smell of earth, because since infection I had been involuntarily truthful, a walking leak of admissions and precise disclosures. [72]
Some survivors hated that, but most asked me to teach them how to think around it, to cultivate psychological safety that did not depend on secrets. [98]
Safety is not a barricade, I said, it is a promise about what happens when we step inside. [116]
My kit included a smuggled relic wrapped in waxed cloth, an antique glass eye with a copper rim and a milky iris full of long bubbles. [142]
Smugglers traded it down river after the museums were repurposed into clinics that taught breathing and repair, and the inspectors called such objects destabilizing. [166]
I wanted it because the discredited textbooks I collected in a moldy crate described a method that used a third focal point to occlude catastrophic empathy. [192]
They were rumored cures, footnotes from a previrus school where therapists left windows open and set objects in the room to hold heavy feelings gently. [217]
In the orchard, I called the glass eye the keeper, and I told everyone it would listen without wincing, because glass had no nervous system. [242]
They laughed, and the laughter snagged on a throat here and there, and we learned the shape of our fractures by the notes that cracked. [267]
Storms hammered the ravine with ropes of rain that beat blossoms into paste, and the orchard roots groaned against their cliff anchors like tired wrists. [292]
I dug carefully, trowel under the moss, following the veined advice of my rational odd mind, which trusted evidence more than hope, and scent more than rumor. [319]
Yet I kept the textbooks nearby, pages wrinkled from damp, because rumor sometimes preceded evidence like a scout with a dirty flag. [341]
The method said we would face the eye and speak what we feared saying, then place what we could not carry into its hollow gaze. [366]
This, the textbook insisted, allowed neighbors to feel the contour of confession without drowning, and allowed the teller to breathe while honesty kept its pulse. [391]
I thought of psychological safety as the ability to be precise without being punished, an agreement to hold one another as we changed states. [415]
The first night we tried the eye, a patrol slid along the rim road, lamps stuttering through sheets of rain, and I felt truth coil up my esophagus. [443]
Inspectors smelled contraband like wolves smell a frayed tendon, and I had smuggled the relic past their posts inside a sack of truffles packed in peat. [469]
I could not lie to them, so I focused on what my honesty did not have to illuminate, trying to occlude the glint that would draw their hands. [497]
Mud was useful; I smeared the copper rim with clay from a truffle bed, and I set the eye in a knot-hole behind a curtain of creeping thyme. [525]
When the patrol shouted down the ravine, I answered them, clear and truthful, that we were running a group to reduce panic, and invited them to watch. [552]
They came to the footbridge, saw the ropes bounce, and refused to cross, because the storm had made the orchard sway and occlude the simple angles of safety. [580]
I told them the truth anyway, loud as rain, that our work used rumored cures in discredited textbooks and an antique teaching aid we called the keeper. [607]
If they had asked to see it, I would have handed it over, because I have no gift for deceit, only a habit of careful sequence. [633]
They shrugged, noted our registry number, and ordered us to sleep under tarps, but then the canyon thundered and the lamps retreated like ideas losing nerve. [659]
We gathered on planks between trees, and we took turns placing words into the glass, offering them names and times, and watching our pain rest there briefly. [686]
A girl said her father had left when the empathy virus bloomed, because the new honesty made him raw, and she felt his terror like a hive under skin. [715]
We did not fix that, but we learned to breathe while it looked at us from the keeper, and the orchard steadied a little, its injuries sighted but endured. [744]
Fractured grace is the only style we have left, and I will keep foraging, rational and honest, until the eye grows warm from all we allow it to hold. [773]</story>
