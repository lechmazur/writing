<story>
Within a mirrored reflection, the lighthouse prison off a jagged reef kept the sea like a tamed beast behind bars. <words>20</words>
There, a weatherbeaten knight traced salt scars on his gauntlets and listened to the spiral stair hum like a shell pressed to an enormous ear. <words>45</words>
He had come to hush the final cry of regret that ferried across the water each dusk like a gull with a throat of bells. <words>70</words>
Every door was a choice he could not unlatch, and every choice felt impossible, the corridor a hymn to impossible choices. <words>91</words>
At the highest landing, the brass door knocker wore a lion's face that had forgotten how to roar and remembered only the patience of waves. <words>116</words>
The knight lifted it, and the sound was grudgingly sweet, like old honey forced from a jar, unwilling yet generous. <words>136</words>
A mirror set into the cell door bloomed with his reflection, and time curled inward so that everything unfolded within a mirrored reflection, tight as rope. <words>162</words>
He saw the knight he had been, the sea he had crossed, and the face he had ruined with years of joyful agony. <words>185</words>
Within that silver, a prisoner arranged a set of seemingly random items that form a pattern: a cork, a nail, a feather, a tooth, a loop of twine. <words>213</words>
The pattern mapped tides, grief, and the locked habit of his own heart, pointing not outward but deeper into the echoing spiral. <words>235</words>
If he chose mercy, the sea would rise and swallow the reef; if he chose justice, the prisoner would become the cry that never ended. <words>260</words>
He understood that impossible choices are only the visible petals of a root that twists unseen through every hour we pretend to own. <words>283</words>
So he knelt where the stair met the door, and tried to appreciate the small, living pattern, the grudgingly sweet way the cork forgave the nail. <words>309</words>
He pressed the brass door knocker once more, and in the mirror his other self pressed back, two tides agreeing to fall together rather than drown alone. <words>336</words>
The door yielded, not to force but to balance, and the prisoner stepped out, carrying the pattern like a chart the night itself could read. <words>361</words>
Together they walked onto the beacon balcony, where wind combed their hair and waves rehearsed futures without rage, and the cry folded into foam. <words>385</words>
He bowed to the sea like a stubborn student to a terrible teacher, feeling, with joyful agony, the scrape of learning turn to a useful scar. <words>411</words>
The mirror kept them in its mercy, converting the past from iron to salt, until memory could move through the bars as easily as light through mist. <words>438</words>
This was not happiness, yet it was a release, and the knight, weatherbeaten and finally present, accepted the cost without counting what could never be paid. <words>464</words>
Behind them, the brass door knocker smiled its lionless smile, and the pattern rearranged itself to guide whomever next arrived bearing impossible choices and a wish to hush regret. <words>493</words>
