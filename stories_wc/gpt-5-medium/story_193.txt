<story>
The exiled prince reached the abandoned customs office during the turn of a key that locks away the past. <words>19</words>
Outside, a sudden snowstorm creates a chance encounter by shoving two wandering trajectories into one doorway. <words>35</words>
He found a mapmaker sheltering there, warming numb hands over a tarnished stove. <words>48</words>
Their meeting felt like the familiar unknown, as if memory had sent them notes without signatures. <words>64</words>
Between them lay an antique mortar and pestle wrapped in customs tape, the lone relic the office refused to forget. <words>84</words>
The prince confessed he sought to find the cure for loneliness, though he did not know its dosage or price. <words>104</words>
Unseen forces, the mapmaker said, press on the heart the way drifts press on a door, silent until everything jams. <words>124</words>
The prince, unintentionally iconic in a threadbare coat stitched with comet shapes, laughed and asked for help he could actually use. <words>145</words>
We improve by admitting what we cannot lift alone, the mapmaker answered, sliding the relic toward him. <words>162</words>
He turned the key that had sealed the evidence locker, and dust sighed out like decades exhaling. <words>179</words>
Inside lay stamps, abandoned ledgers, and sachets of crushed wintergreen, the smell like letters from friends you never met. <words>198</words>
The prince set herbs in the antique mortar and pestle, grinding until a low chapel sound gathered under the storm. <words>218</words>
Unseen forces braided through the rhythm, threads of breath and memory weaving a map where one name touched another. <words>237</words>
The mapmaker admitted he once stamped the prince's exile papers here, then quit because the ink kept tasting like snow. <words>257</words>
He had hoped the world would improve without palaces, yet found his maps growing lonelier with each perfect line. <words>276</words>
Together they mixed a tonic of wintergreen, bitter orange peel, and melted snow, then shared it from a chipped demitasse. <words>296</words>
The cure for loneliness was not medicine but attention, the map they drew by tracing each other's hesitations. <words>314</words>
Outside, the storm leaned on the door like a familiar unknown relative, and inside, unseen forces leaned back, kindly and firm. <words>335</words>
When the key finished turning, the lock accepted their promise to use the office as a way station for stray souls. <words>356</words>
Word would travel that an unintentionally iconic figure brewed comfort where taxes once ruled, but neither of them planned a legend. <words>377</words>
They stamped passports of the heart with the antique mortar and pestle's muted thrum, allowing grief to enter and leave with dignity. <words>399</words>
In that echoing room, the exiled prince finally felt the world improve, and loneliness loosened its last knot. <words>417</words>
