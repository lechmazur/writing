I was the scrappy tavern-hand who watered stars in a vacuum chamber garden, sweeping dust from unfurling glass leaves. <words>19</words>
The patrons preferred beer to botany, but the owner preferred tourists paying for the novelty of cosmic horticulture. <words>37</words>
I joked while I worked, a flippant solemnity draped like an apron that caught ash and stray prayers. <words>55</words>
On slow nights I arranged my collection of seashells, broken from travels that had never reached a shore. <words>73</words>
Each shard hummed when pressed to the observation glass, like the ocean trying to phone from a dismantled booth. <words>92</words>
I told myself the calls were chemical moods, predictably unpredictable as the taproom fights I mopped at dawn. <words>110</words>
But the shells insisted otherwise, vibrating in patterns that seemed to randomize purpose until a pattern clicked open. <words>128</words>
A map unscrolled across the soil like spilled starlight, while the sands of time flow backward behind the dome. <words>147</words>
Tourists photographed the phenomenon, thinking it part of the show, and tipped me in constellations of small coin. <words>165</words>
The owner shrugged, predictably unpredictable, then muttered that if time wanted a refund it could file the paperwork. <words>183</words>
I snuck outside during maintenance, carrying the shells in a tea tin dented like a tiny cratered moon. <words>201</words>
Beyond the enclosure, the dry riverbed began, a petrified ribbon where fossilized footprints climbed beside my shadow. <words>218</words>
They were not human, not entirely, but they were mine the way debts and lullabies belong to you. <words>236</words>
I stepped into them, heel to heel, and the world toggled like a jukebox that forgot its favorite song. <words>255</words>
The tracks answered my questions through the fossilized footprints in a dried-up riverbed, a method as old as doubt. <words>274</words>
Follow, they said without mouths, because some callings are inescapable and grow loudest where breath should freeze. <words>291</words>
I laughed, a bark to scare fear into behaving, and promised to clock back in if destiny underpaid me. <words>310</words>
The footprints carried me to a crater gardened with vacuum, where seeds clicked like beads counting backward prayers. <words>328</words>
I planted the broken shells as markers, and their edges gathered moonwind, knitting a current along bone-white furrows. <words>346</words>
Images erupted, randomized yet certain: taverns on comets, gardens inside songs, people tipping the universe for good service. <words>364</words>
The future was a bar tab closed with a flourish, and the past was the receipt, suspiciously generous. <words>382</words>
My motive clarified: to catapult imagination beyond known realms, not as escape, but as meaningful collision with what waits. <words>401</words>
So I returned to the vacuum chamber garden, still while the sands of time flow backward, and opened the dome. <words>421</words>
Air roared in like a thirsty chorus, plants bowed, tourists squealed, and the owner blessed me with a spreadsheet. <words>440</words>
I placed the tea tin on the soil and asked the customers to listen politely to the resurrected sea. <words>459</words>
The shells sang our order, not drinks but directions, and even the cash register nodded as if it understood. <words>478</words>
We stepped into knowledge like a well-mopped floor, slipping and laughing, solemn and flippant, called and choosing, predictably unpredictable. <words>497</words>
