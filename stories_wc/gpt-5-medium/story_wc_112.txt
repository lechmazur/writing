<story>On the plateau rim where frost smoked off the solar arrays, the station listened. [14]
It was a xenobiology research station arranged like a harp for the wind. [27]
Inside, every corridor held the hush of beating wings at rest, a paradoxical silence. [41]
Jae was the obliging sky mechanic who kept the glide-gantries tuned for the migratory mantas. [56]
He had hands roughened by cold, and a voice that carried an icy warmth. [70]
People trusted that voice when parts whined or when auroras troubled the telemetry. [83]
This season, the mantas stopped arriving, and the biologists whispered about subdued awakenings. [96]
They feared something in the geomagnetic shoals had lulled the giants into a wider dream. [111]
Jae feared something else, less biological and more temporal. [120]
He was trying to prove that time moves sideways, slipping across like wind over water. [135]
Sideways time would explain why a flock could arrive before their own departure had begun. [150]
It would explain why the mantas might be here, only shifted into an orthogonal now. [165]
The biologists humored him because he kept the cranes and drones mechanically warm in the cruel mornings. [182]
That, and his manner of listening without shiver, made him hard to dismiss. [195]
The station straddled a ravine where the compasses ticked like trapped insects at twilight. [209]
Data suggested a magnetic nexus at twilight bloomed there, a knot where direction went blind. [224]
Jae fashioned a probe to map it through holographic principles, layering fields upon ghosted fields. [239]
He patched the probe into the old tracking gantry, a rail that curved like a wish. [255]
To power the array, he had to lean into a vault smelling of ozone and distant rain. [272]
A single lever governed the local coils, smeared with a century of anxious hands. [286]
The maintenance manual warned about surge tides, but the manual was written for linear seas. [301]
He pulled, and the coils woke with a sound like breath pulled sideways through ice. [316]
The vault lights dimmed, then resolved into shifting planes, an architecture of delayed reflections. [330]
He kept his place by the rhythm of his heart and the solid memory of bolts. [346]
Outside, wind combed the research decks, and the mantas slept somewhere sideways from the weather. [361]
Through the visor camera, the probe painted a lattice that looked like a city mid-yawn. [376]
Windows opened where none should be, showing yesterday from the angle of tomorrow. [389]
Jae whispered to the station, the way one speaks to an anxious bird. [402]
Stay, he said, within the hush of beating wings at rest, do not startle the day. [418]
The lattice steadied, and the data began to fall in sheets like early snow. [432]
He saw how the magnetic nexus at twilight had trapped a corridor of possibility. [446]
The mantas were alive, moving, but their wake spread laterally across timestamps like oil on water. [462]
If he could tune the gantry, he could give them an exit ramp back to here. [478]
Through holographic principles again, he inverted the fields so that the corridor refracted homeward. [492]
His breath fogged, and warmth only reached him through the instruments, a mechanically warm promise. [507]
Somewhere beyond the ravine, the air rippled, and lights bowed as if a parade passed sideways. [523]
One manta arrived first, then two, then ten, their sails unfurling in silence like winter flags. [539]
They circled the station slowly, their shadows crossing him twice for every once. [552]
He laughed, a small sound tucked into the icy warmth of the returning herd. [566]
The biologists cheered and wept, and he felt their gratitude like a tailwind at his back. [582]
But proving sideways time would take more than rescue; it needed witness and repeatable grace. [597]
Jae set markers in the air, holographic beacons that pulsed with the mantas' wingbeats. [611]
Each pulse skittered sideways, returning not behind but beside the originating moment. [623]
He recorded the offsets, a careful ledger of echoes, and offered it to the quiet. [638]
The station accepted, for stations accept by not failing, and by holding their breath. [652]
In the days after, the mantas nested along the ravine, slow and grateful, as if thawing. [668]
Their eyes held a long light that made people step softly and laugh with their mouths closed. [685]
Jae repaired what the surge had loosened, still obliging, still listening for the sidelong gust. [700]
Sometimes at dusk he returned to the lever, not to pull it, just to touch the history. [717]
In the softened light, the vault sang faintly, a choir of delayed selves gliding past his shoulder. [734]
He told no one that the returns included him, slightly turned, slightly smiling at a different time. [751]
He liked that the proof arrived as an affection, not a test, and felt forgiven. [766]
Winter built its mirrors and passed, and the mantas began to leave on time again. [781]
When they rose, the station trembled, and the air smelled like cold salt and new paper. [797]</story>
