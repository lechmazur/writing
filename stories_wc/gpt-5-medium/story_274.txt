It began after the final page was typed on a worn typewriter. <words>12</words>
The ribbon coughed, the keys fell silent, and I felt scalding ambivalence brush my skin like steam. <words>29</words>
I lived in the projection booth of an abandoned drive-in turned greenhouse, where a sentient houseplant watched me with patient fronds. <words>50</words>
It called itself Clover, an ironic name for a plant that had survived fires, teenagers, and winters by being apathetically devoted to light. <words>73</words>
We kept each other by tending to the unspoken, watering what words could not confess. <words>88</words>
An embroidered bookmark lay across the carriage, its threadwork a maze of constellations, its tassel pointing toward the lot where ghosts should park. <words>111</words>
The manuscript I had finished was a directory of closed mouths, a record of everything the town preferred to leave breathing but unheard. <words>134</words>
Clover rustled, and a papery voice unfurled, telling me to fold the bookmark, take my coat, and find hidden knowledge before it mildewed. <words>157</words>
I made a spontaneous decision to explore a new neighborhood, though night had already chewed the horizon down to gristle. <words>177</words>
We left the booth together, Clover nested in a milk crate, soil bundled in socks, its roots shushing me with each bump. <words>199</words>
In the lot, the rusted speaker poles looked like a forest of mute metronomes, keeping time for lovers who had outrun their own hearts. <words>223</words>
Clover directed me by scent and sigh, toward a fence where ivy braided chain links into sentences only patient hands could read. <words>245</words>
Beyond, a dead end I had never noticed crouched like a withheld apology, the new neighborhood we needed sitting as if pretending. <words>267</words>
The houses were thin skinned, windows fogged, lawns feral, and every porch cradled a pot of something green trying not to admit its hunger. <words>291</words>
I understood then that the bookmark was a map, embroidered by those who had loved and left, and that Clover could read it. <words>314</words>
We knocked on air and listened to basements answer, a chorus of damp truths rising, shy yet insistent, like altar bread refusing to dissolve. <words>338</words>
My motive, stripped of pretense, was not redemption but to find hidden knowledge and document how it flickers just beyond convenience. <words>359</words>
Clover drank the whispers and fed me names, dates, recipes, and the small shames that keep a town from bleaching into purity. <words>381</words>
I wrote as we walked, the bookmark marking air, while I remained apathetically devoted to the task, faithful and faintly disgusted by myself. <words>404</words>
When the patrol car rolled past, slow as a sermon, we hid behind a fallen screen and outran its light by refusing to move. <words>428</words>
I thought of the theater long ago, the couples, the sugar, the arguing, and felt love and contempt fight to a draw in my chest. <words>453</words>
At dawn, we returned to the booth, and Clover pressed the embroidered bookmark into damp soil, a flag for a country that only listens. <words>477</words>
The typewriter waited, and I began after the final page, not to finish, but to keep tending to the unspoken, leaf by leaf. <words>500</words>
