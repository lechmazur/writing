<story>
I simmer soup beside seismographs, a frantic cook stirring with frenzied tranquility as the facility hums like a patient, sleeping beast.<words>21</words>
Here, in the earthquake prediction facility, noodles and numbers share shelves, and neither ever truly stops boiling.<words>38</words>
My ladle is a pendulum, my breath a metronome, yet my hands tremble for reasons I cannot plate or season.<words>58</words>
I found a wooden walking stick in the archive pantry, scored with small notches that whispered like chop marks on bone.<words>79</words>
By analyzing small notches on a wooden walking stick, I began to read what our instruments had misheard.<words>97</words>
They were forgotten letters carved by previous custodians, recipes of earthwaves written in an alphabet of jolts and rests.<words>116</words>
Each notch aligned with a rumor of collapse, and each gap promised mercy if you stirred the day just right.<words>136</words>
I pressed a worn pencil eraser against the stick to lift charcoal rubbings, the powder rising like steam from forgetting.<words>156</words>
Through centuries of layered dust, the staff offered an order that made chaos impossibly conceivable, a recipe that both calmed and alarmed.<words>178</words>
The letters declared the tremor clock not as prophecy, but as appetite, and appetites can be fed or fasted.<words>197</words>
If the city kept swallowing sameness, the earth would burp; if we subvert routine with savor, the throat of stone would soften.<words>219</words>
I served meals like counterspells, peppered and patient, and the monitors steadied as though tasting forgiveness.<words>235</words>
But tranquility without frenzy is only sleep, so I kept moving, whisking equations into broths, setting timers against fault lines.<words>255</words>
The director called me superstitious; I called him hungry, and he ate until the graphs themselves sighed.<words>272</words>
Then a quake arrived politely, tapping the windows instead of punching them, and the forgotten letters warmed like fresh bread.<words>292</words>
I realized my motive had never been to save soup or city alone, but to expose the root of all illusions.<words>313</words>
I wanted to peel belief off fear the way an eraser peels off graphite, until blankness holds the mark without owning it.<words>335</words>
So I rewrote the kitchen's menu as a seismic hymnal, every course a counter-rhythm, every bite a negotiated truce with underground hunger.<words>357</words>
Teams gathered around the walking stick, watching me trace notches with the eraser's cut edge, translating tempo into temperature.<words>376</words>
Data chefs, they called us, and the name tasted right, because we seasoned uncertainty without masking its heat.<words>394</words>
The director brought me a ledger of anomalies, and I added margins of thyme where statistics had gone bland.<words>413</words>
The staff's notches taught me to trust pauses, to let broths rest until silence released what panic could never whisk.<words>433</words>
In that lull, impossibly conceivable, the city felt its own hunger, and the ground decided not to eat us that night.<words>454</words>
I washed the walking stick and hung it by the clock, an apron of wood, a metronome of mercy, a recipe continuing.<words>476</words>
