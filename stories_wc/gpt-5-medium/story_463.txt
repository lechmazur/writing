Just after the final name is crossed off the salt-spattered list, I enter the haunted lighthouse keeper's bedroom with reckless precision. <words>21</words>
I am the sentinel they forgot to bury, a dry-witted custodian of oaths that erode like paint in sea-wind. <words>40</words>
Promises here crumble by habit, not malice, and I have come to learn traditional methods before their last fragments bleach away. <words>61</words>
The bed creaks, the wardrobe breathes, and I ask the dust to testify, because confession is certainly possible when the house itself remembers. <words>84</words>
On the pillow a piece of rope lies, frayed to whisper-thin hairs, as if combed nightly by the tide. <words>103</words>
I confiscate it from the room the way a bailiff might confiscate a lie, cataloging its knots like dates on a calendar. <words>125</words>
Each knot corresponds to a name, and tonight the last knot slackened, which is why my arrival feels both late and right. <words>147</words>
The keeper's portrait watches, gaunt as a lantern in fog, while I chalk circles on the floorboards to pace my questions. <words>168</words>
We had a method once, he and I, a shared love for a specific type of dance: the tarantella of interrogation. <words>189</words>
He would stamp out riddles, I would spin answers, and our heelwork kept time with a ticking barometer of guilt. <words>209</words>
But promises eroded, steps faltered, and the shoreline turned complicated, so he broke the dance into lists and names and warnings. <words>230</words>
To learn traditional methods again, I lift the rope and let it lead, tracing the tarantella's circles around the bedposts. <words>250</words>
Boards thud underfoot like drumheads, and the wardrobe exhales a salt-prayer; in that rhythm the voice of the keeper returns. <words>270</words>
I ask why the list had to end, and he replies that endings are the only locks strong enough to hold eroding promises. <words>293</words>
Then he bids me look beneath the mattress, where ledger pages curl like beached fish, and a final step waits without music. <words>315</words>
The step demands I confiscate every false comfort: the extra blanket smelling of cloves, the mirror that edits, the anchor tattoo that lies. <words>338</words>
It feels like cruelty, but the rope tightens around my wrist, reminding me that tenderness without truth is only a harbor for storms. <words>361</words>
I am a dry-witted sentinel, yet tonight I bleed respect into every measured cruelty the lesson requires. <words>378</words>
The keeper nods from the frame, a ripple through varnish, approving my ugly dance as the right inheritance. <words>396</words>
I leave the bedroom barefoot, rope coiled, promises renewed by a fiercer, older choreography. <words>410</words>
