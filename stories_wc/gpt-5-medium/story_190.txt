<story>I, a cautious smuggler, arrived at the drought prediction center with a pressed butterfly tucked in my ledger, pretending not to care and caring far too much. <words>27</words>
The lobby's cooling vents hummed a tune of enthusiastic apathy, which fit me like a suit tailored in a hurry and altered for patience. <words>51</words>
I had been contracted to sit in the observation bay during the painter's confession, a session conducted through delirious confessions under anesthesia to sharpen the forecasts. <words>77</words>
My meticulously impulsive plan was simple: smuggle in a memory, listen without flinching, and learn to become a master of empathy by following its echoes. <words>102</words>
The center decoded storms from musical memories, melodies coaxed from anesthetized artists whose tongues betrayed rainfall in a key of thirst. <words>123</words>
I was there because my cargo, for once, was not contraband seeds or illegal pumps, but a song no one else could carry. <words>146</words>
It lived in the pressed butterfly, each powdered scale a bar of notation, each fracture in its wing a measure. <words>166</words>
The painter on the table, lids fluttering, began to predict parch and flood in glissandos, and I stitched his delirium to the butterfly's quiet staff. <words>191</words>
Enthusiastic apathy kept my hands steady; I felt the thrill of detachment, a zeal for neutrality that let each note pass through untouched. <words>214</words>
The technicians nodded around their consoles, unaware that smuggling a song into a confession could bend their maps without breaking a law. <words>236</words>
I wanted the painter to hear my freight inside his storm talk, to name it, so that I could finally hear people the way deserts hear rivers coming. <words>264</words>
He gasped a chromatic list of villages, then whispered a street where a child kept jars of dust tuned to her late mother's laughter. <words>288</words>
That address matched a drop I had dodged years ago, when I was too cautious to risk empathy and too meticulous to admit it. <words>312</words>
Now my meticulously impulsive thumb cracked the butterfly's case open, releasing a soft snow of scales that settled on the painter's lips. <words>334</words>
He sang the hidden stanza I had smuggled, and the drought prediction center's graphs warped into a map of listening, isobars curling toward mercy. <words>358</words>
Predictions reshaped into promises: send caravans not of water first, but of ears, then the wells will rise to meet the mouths that remember them. <words>383</words>
I felt nothing and everything, like a ledger discovering it can bleed. <words>395</words>
The painter laughed, awake and baffled, yet grateful for the precise trespass. <words>407</words>
He called me teacher, but I knew I was only beginning to become a master of empathy. <words>424</words>
So I packed the empty case, cataloged the silence, and predicted that next time I would smuggle nothing but attention. <words>444</words></story>
