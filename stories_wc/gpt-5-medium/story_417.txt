<story>I was studying tropical ecclesiology in a vine-choked Victorian parlor that had wandered into the jungle like a lost governess with an armful of hymnals. <words>25</words>
The books steamed as if they were kettles, and my margins bloomed with theoretically playful diagrams that nonetheless insisted on practical consequences. <words>47</words>
Opposite me lounged the unhinged zealot I had hired as a tutor, whose syllabus promised revelation through uncomfortable chairs and impeccably folded umbrellas. <words>70</words>
We had unspoken agreements about everything, from how loudly the orchids could applaud to how softly the carpet should deny responsibility for footsteps. <words>93</words>
He poured tea from a skull-shaped pot, then placed a plain metal bottle cap beside my notes as if it were a sacrament awaiting translation. <words>118</words>
The cap had no insignia, no memory, no rust, and so it seemed an honest instrument, a clean hinge for a door the jungle hid. <words>143</words>
He said little, preferring a method he called a whispered confession in a dark room, despite the parlor being bright with parrots impersonating gaslight. <words>167</words>
So I closed my eyes like curtains and told him, during studying, that the diagrams only worked if my hands trembled while I traced them. <words>192</words>
He approved by rearranging the furniture into a polite barricade, an earnest absurdity that obliged the orchids to apply for visas before scent could travel. <words>217</words>
Then he instructed me to uproot a chair, roots and all, because the legs had learned to drink anxiety from the damp and were hoarding it. <words>243</words>
I lifted until splinters confessed, and as the moss sighed, I understood the contract between burden and gesture, how unspoken agreements can be signed by posture. <words>269</words>
The bottle cap became our seal: each time I set it on the table, he would ask a question whose answer expected the trembling to show up honest. <words>297</words>
When I faltered, he leaned close and let the parrots cast shadows like velvet lecterns, and I realized I was studying my own cowardice more than scripture. <words>324</words>
To find strength in vulnerability, he whispered, you must let your arguments shiver openly, the way tea rattles when honesty is about to be poured. <words>349</words>
So I confessed that I loved the damp furniture because it remembered storms better than I did, and that memory felt like a stern, forgiving parent. <words>375</words>
He nodded with the terrifying gentleness of a metronome, unhinged not by violence but by precision, as if certainty itself had sawed through his hinges. <words>400</words>
Together we inventoried the room, listing what could be replanted in me, and what must be left wild, so the parrots would have honest work. <words>425</words>
When dusk finally made a dark room of the parlor, I offered a whispered confession to the bottle cap, and its gleam approved, signing our quiet freedom. <words>452</words>
