At dusk, the frail guard named Ivo watched the causeway sink beneath the returning sea that ringed our tidal island. <words>20</words>
The town painted allegiances on doors and oars, a yearly carnival of pigments deciding who belonged and who would be sent away. <words>42</words>
We called it sorting, though the elders insisted our futures were selected by tides and saints, not by the brushstrokes they directed. <words>64</words>
Ivo kept the watchtower key, his hands resolutely wavering when he moved, like gulls buffeted by wind yet refusing the cliff. <words>85</words>
He told me he guarded nothing except stories, and that stories can lock or open doors more surely than iron. <words>105</words>
Our friendship began through messages carved in tree bark along the path to the well, where the brackish water tasted of letters. <words>127</words>
Each note asked whether I feared the paint, and each reply confessed I would wear any color to escape a predetermined fate. <words>149</words>
Ivo answered that he had once been sorted into blue, the ferrymen's hue, though his chest rattled too weakly to haul nets or gulls. <words>173</words>
They made him a guard only because the tower needed a human shadow the gulls would not roost upon. <words>192</words>
When the boats returned, wagons rolled out with jars of pigments and a sour-smelling alchemy phial the elders kept in velvet. <words>213</words>
They said the phial contained proof that colors chose us, not we them, and set it beside the church bell throughout sorting. <words>235</words>
But rain had slicked the chapel steps, and I saw Ivo slip, yank the velvet open, and pocket the little glass heartbeat. <words>257</words>
Later he confessed that the phial held nothing but bay water and vinegar, a scent to stun faith long enough for thinking. <words>279</words>
If the proof was false, he murmured, then painted allegiances were only agreements, and agreements could be renegotiated by the desperate. <words>300</words>
That night, the tide trapped us, the bell muffled, and through the dark I followed marks he cut into birch, a whispered map. <words>323</words>
He led me to a cave where old banners rotted, colors sloughed into nameless damp, and we made a fire to dry our fear. <words>347</words>
Ivo spoke of choosing no color and all, of refusing the brush by wearing the tide's gray, his voice a hopeful melancholy. <words>369</words>
At dawn we returned cloaked in ash from the fire, and the elders stared as if the sea had walked into their square. <words>392</words>
Ivo set the phial on the stone and broke it with the key, releasing a smell like grief learning its own small courage. <words>415</words>
He declared that the guard would guard no longer, and that I would not be sorted, because agreements could be remade without paint. <words>438</words>
Some shouted, some wept, yet no one moved when his resolutely wavering hands opened the tower gate and rang the unblessed hour. <words>460</words>
The bell sang a thin permission, and we stepped past the causeway line, not chosen by color but by our sudden courage to choose. <words>484</words>
