After the last stone is set in an abandoned wall, I bike to the coral restoration station with breathless longing for a task I can finally complete. <words>27</words>
I am an academically artistic, free-spirited herbalist who trades tinctures for raw data and knits field notes into rituals. <words>46</words>
In my backpack clacks a vintage sewing kit, its tiny scissors shining like fish scales under lab lights. <words>64</words>
I came here to hush the hollow echoes of shame that rattle the heart of doubt inside my chest. <words>83</words>
The reef team stacks limestone domes like unfinished walls, and my hands itch to set stitches where mortar once failed. <words>103</words>
I begin to memorize coral names and pH tables through forgotten letters my grandmother wrote from a different shoreline, letters I found tucked beneath the sewing kit's pinwheel. <words>131</words>
Her script wandered like tidal pools, describing an abandoned wall built during evacuations, and how silence kept her safe but small. <words>152</words>
After the last stone was set, she listened for cracks that never spoke; now I listen beneath tanks for polyps learning to breathe. <words>175</words>
Being academically artistic means I draw the currents like proofs and annotate algae blooms with the patience of a theorem. <words>195</words>
I tincture sea rosemary with laboratory ethanol, then thread coral fragments to substrates using needles from the kit, each knot a promise against erosion. <words>219</words>
Yet the heart of doubt keeps tidal time, thumping whenever a frond pales, whenever a tank thermometer blinks its cold arithmetic. <words>240</words>
So I memorize her letters by moonlight, speaking them into skimmers to hush the hollow echoes of shame she could not untie. <words>262</words>
The reef modules rise like an abandoned wall laid sideways, and the last stone we set today felt less like an ending than a hinge. <words>287</words>
My vintage sewing kit becomes a reliquary of brine and thread, housing salt stiffened thimbles and the small compass that keeps me facing swellward. <words>311</words>
I am free spirited enough to sing to sponges, but academically artistic enough to graph their shy replies, because I want forgiveness to become measurable. <words>336</words>
In her last letter, postmarked from nowhere, my grandmother wrote that courage arrives through forgotten letters we read aloud until doubt loses its breath. <words>360</words>
Tonight I string juvenile corals in a gentle line, as if hemming a dress for the tide, and I whisper until my hands stop shaking. <words>385</words>
The hollow echoes fade to a shoreline murmur, the heart of doubt beating softer as the reef takes stitch after stitch of living color. <words>409</words>
