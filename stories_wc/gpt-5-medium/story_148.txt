Wind taught me patience long before the mountains did. <words>9</words>
I am a storm chaser living in the desert, but I came to this alpine monastery chasing a calmer rotation. <words>29</words>
The abandoned carousel sleeping in my hometown square once turned like a gentle cyclone, and I promised to restore it. <words>49</words>
Every winter, between tasks assigned by the monks, I search for plans no blueprint could hold. <words>65</words>
They said the secret was woven into an old tapestry in the refectory, its border frayed like a sky after lightning. <words>86</words>
So I read the fabric as if it were radar, by decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border to map the carousel's ancestry. <words>109</words>
Knots became coordinates, faded dyes became warnings, and gaps marked places where rush would exacerbate the wood's grief. <words>127</words>
I was eagerly unwilling to believe restoration meant imitation, because storms taught me that return is never the same as arrival. <words>148</words>
The monks lent me a quiet bench and a pair of blacksmith's tongs scavenged from a shed that remembered snowbound fairs. <words>169</words>
With the tongs I held heated rivets steady, yet my hands trembled at the thought of spinning childhood back into gear. <words>190</words>
Inner strength, I learned, is not the gale inside your ribs but the hush that lets weight settle where it belongs. <words>211</words>
One afternoon a front rolled over the peaks, and bells shook like cups of hail, but I stayed with the cloth. <words>232</words>
The border told me that each horse needed a new balance point, a small shift in bearing only a patient storm would bless. <words>255</words>
Back home, sand lifts off the flats and marches, but here the air stacks itself in layers of memory and invention. <words>276</words>
I sketched a gear that could sip wind like thin tea, translating mountain patience into desert endurance. <words>293</words>
The tongs pinched a test ring while I bent it, and the monks watched with suspense that did not speak its name. <words>315</words>
If I hurried, I would only exacerbate old splits, so I let the metal cool and listened to the storm step past. <words>337</words>
Between tasks I returned to the border, tracing a horse stitched from six dyes into a blueprint tough enough for sand. <words>358</words>
Nostalgic innovation, one monk whispered, because he heard in the plan the echo of carousels and the hum of weather stations. <words>379</words>
When spring opens the passes, I will carry these tongs, the sketches, and the hush I earned, and the carousel will turn again. <words>402</words>
