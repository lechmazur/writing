<story>The glass desert keeps its heat like a prayer that refuses to cool.<words>13</words>
I cross it as an unconvinced missionary, throat raw from explaining beliefs I no longer believe.<words>29</words>
Ahead of me wavers a single monarch butterfly, the last, a lantern ember drifting toward an unpromised coast.<words>47</words>
I follow it because the old hymns say signs arrive when the throat is dust, and my faith is very tested.<words>68</words>
The dunes are shards that ring, capriciously consistent in how they cut and how they sing at night.<words>86</words>
Each step makes a note, and the note comes back wrong, like a chapel bell stuffed with moths.<words>104</words>
I carry a tarnished silver fork in my pocket, a pilgrim utensil turned tuning companion, cool as regret.<words>122</words>
It pings when I strike a rib of glass, and the echo makes a map only I pretend to understand.<words>142</words>
I am supposed to gather converts at the ruins ahead, but I intend to become a conduit for magic instead.<words>162</words>
The elders would call that conceit, so I conceal my purpose under the dry rattle of traveling alone.<words>180</words>
Where the desert glass flattens, a rusted piano lies open to the sky, its strings like exposed nerves.<words>198</words>
I sit beside it and touch the keys, which answer in broken thuds that ripple outward across the panes.<words>217</words>
The echoes return in patterns that feel older than scripture, wobbling grids of intervals nobody ever taught me.<words>235</words>
So I begin decoding, noting the distances between the wrong notes as if they were tracks left by angels.<words>254</words>
The fork hums when I hold it near a certain crack, and the monarch steadies as though listening also.<words>273</words>
A message surfaces, capriciously consistent, saying that faith is not a wall but a resonant body, and resonance must be risked.<words>294</words>
I strike a chord the piano hates, and the dunes around us shift, revealing a corridor of cooled, drinkable shadow.<words>314</words>
In that shadow I remember every face I failed to convince, and how I kept speaking long after I stopped hearing myself.<words>336</words>
Their doubts come back as sympathy, and I understand that my tested faith is a door no one else can open.<words>357</words>
I play again, by decoding patterns in an untuned piano's echoes, and the fork shivers like a compass finding true.<words>377</words>
Sound threads into the butterfly, which trembles and then lifts, guiding me along the corridor as if priest and parish were one.<words>399</words>
All this happens during the migration of the last monarch butterfly, and it feels like forgiveness finally learning my name.<words>419</words></story>
