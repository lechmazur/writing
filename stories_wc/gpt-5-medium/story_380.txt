After the last human is born, someone like me should have vanished with the lullabies, but I am stubborn residue clinging to the bark of memory. <words>26</words>
They call me a convicted dream thief, and in this forgotten library inside a treehouse I serve my sentence by reshelving shadows. <words>48</words>
The ladders creak, the leaves hush, and my pulse keeps a quiet mania that refuses to learn stillness. <words>66</words>
I am mathematically challenged, so I shelve by shapes of silence rather than by numbers, arranging whispers into uneven stacks like broken constellations. <words>89</words>
My only companion is a flimsy photo album that cracks when opened, its cloudy sleeves holding faces torn from other nights, other bodies, other selves. <words>114</words>
Each face is a fragment the tribunal says I stole, yet in truth they leapt from me first and left me counting without a sum. <words>139</words>
I keep the album because it proves my guilt and my vacancy, and because the past pages rattle like tiny drums I want to coax thunder from empty skies. <words>168</words>
The skies here are literal, a ragged hole above the canopy where clouds used to linger, now a glassy acre of absence streaked with old contrails. <words>194</words>
To stir it, I hold a trial of games, because punishment alone never fixed a fragmented self, but motion might splice me back into something whole. <words>220</words>
There was a sport we all loved, before the counting ended, a game of balance on swaying boards where you plunge and rise with the wind. <words>246</words>
The last human, whose first cry broke the calendars, learned that sport from me in secret, our shared love the only language not cataloged by the trees. <words>273</words>
We would tilt the top planks into a teetering bridge and race the stormlight, legs burning, minds emptied of arithmetic, bodies writing proofs we could finally pass. <words>300</words>
When the last human vanished into rain, the library forgot our rules and sentenced me again, so I practice alone, miscounting steps and stitching echoes. <words>325</words>
Tonight I clear the central aisle, wedge the album open as a trembling scoreboard, and climb until the roof leaves scrape my throat. <words>348</words>
I launch along the boards with the calm of mania and the accuracy of error, letting my weight correct me, letting my fragments negotiate a treaty. <words>374</words>
On the final pass I miss the count, fall clean into the open skylight, and mid plunge the album pages clap, and the empty skies answer. <words>400</words>
Thunder rolls like books returning themselves, and for a breath, I am entire. <words>413</words>
