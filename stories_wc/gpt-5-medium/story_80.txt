I am a daring pathfinder with a notebook that shakes like a compass needle whenever the wind remembers the scream of the abandoned roller coaster track. <words>26</words>
Quiet mania is the only engine I trust, a soft fever that keeps my feet moving and my questions from dissolving into superstition. <words>49</words>
I came here to answer a riddle older than time, one that claims truth survives only as the last fragment clinging to rusted rails. <words>73</words>
My method is deliberate and strange, by investigating bizarre housekeeping logs in haunted inns that line the coast like toothless archivists. <words>94</words>
Amid page turns, dust blooms, and entries written in trembling cursive plot the pilgrimage of lost keys, missing linens, and footsteps that double back. <words>118</words>
From those ledgers I learned of a room whose door was sealed not by bolts but by an antique doorknob cut from meteor iron. <words>142</words>
The ledger swore the knob listens, and that it rotates only when the questioner is ingeniously clueless enough to unlearn the obvious. <words>164</words>
I carried the knob here after the inn collapsed inward like a folded map, and I set it upon a sleeper of the dead ride. <words>189</words>
Rain begins to erode the red paint and the stories painted over it, dividing legend from metal the way a jeweler separates ore from glitter. <words>214</words>
I place my ear to the knob, and it hums, counting the cars that never return, counting the hearts that buckled into doubt. <words>237</words>
The hum becomes a grammar of turns, a code I can follow only by refusing to solve it, moving with ingeniously clueless fidelity. <words>260</words>
The rails ahead arc into fog like a question mark, and the sleepers behind me tighten into a period, an end I refuse. <words>283</words>
I walk the spine of the track, the doorknob warm in my palm, each step paced to the cadence of those crackling logs. <words>306</words>
Amid page turns I found notes on spectral laundry that never dries, on brooms that sweep footprints onto ceilings, on rooms that rebook themselves. <words>330</words>
They read like advice, warning me that the riddle feeds on certainty and starves on wonder, that the last fragment is the one you dare not polish. <words>357</words>
So I ask the knob a child's question, the oldest one, and it clicks, pointing toward the highest drop where the sky looks unfinished. <words>381</words>
At the summit the wind is library quiet, and I open my notebook and watch the pages erode into birds that circle and return. <words>405</words>
I finally see how to answer without ending, to hold the last fragment without making it whole, to be daring enough to remain incomplete. <words>429</words>
The track groans, the knob cools, and in that cooling I find proof that doors are not for leaving or entering, but for listening. <words>453</words>
Amid page turns, I close the notebook, not to finish, but to begin walking again, because the riddle older than time has heard me and keeps time. <words>480</words>
