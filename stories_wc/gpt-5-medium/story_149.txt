In the giant's study, I waited between scenes, an unlikely prophet rehearsing lines no script had given me. <words>18</words>
Haunting delight hummed through the rafters while I turned a wilted paper flower in my hands, its creases remembering storms I could only call softly by name. <words>45</words>
The lamplight broke into glimmering transitions across the ink pools, as if the room itself were editing reality, polishing scene changes before they could bruise. <words>70</words>
I had come to unify scattered minds under a single vision, not by conquest, but by stitching their errant images to a steady, luminous thread. <words>95</words>
Call me conventionally rebellious, because I preferred rules arranged like dominoes, meant to fall in sequence and reveal the hidden picture everyone kept pretending not to see. <words>122</words>
My method had found me during a run-in at a late-night laundromat, where cycles of water performed sermons more persuasive than any choir I had known. <words>148</words>
A stranger pulled a shirt from a turning drum, and the pattern spiraled into a map of futures, each wet edge warning that if we dried apart, we would estrange forever. <words>179</words>

I opened the lamp, letting glimmering transitions spill like migrating fish, each flicker a shared memory I had rescued from the laundromat's drain, threaded now into a traveling constellation. <words>328</words>
Where hurt had taught people to estrange themselves for safety, the little lights demonstrated a safer formation, a school against the shark of loneliness. <words>352</words>
The giant leaned close, his breath turning pages, and decreed I was an unlikely prophet precisely because I believed in ordinary choreography, in socks rotating together until warm and brave. <words>382</words>
He placed the calipers aside and lifted the flower, its wilt a vow to bend without breaking. <words>399</words>
Together we drafted a syllabus for the city, lessons written in laundry steam and ink, promising haunting delight whenever citizens synchronized their breath to the tide. <words>425</words>
When I left, the hallways flickered with glimmering transitions, and my conventionally rebellious heart marched steady, intent to unify scattered minds until no doorway stood between scenes anymore. <words>453</words>
