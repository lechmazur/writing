<story>The moonlit archer slipped into the subterranean colosseum under an old amusement park, guided by breath held tight and cautious impulsiveness. <words>21</words>
Above, the ferris wheel groaned like a calendar, measuring the final flight of a paper airplane that circled through cracked rafters. <words>42</words>
He had come to attain dangerous knowledge he feared, and to bend it toward mercy before it bent him toward ruin. <words>63</words>
His aimlessly passionate years had filled rooms with trophies and silence, but tonight he hunted a different prize, to create a legacy of compassion. <words>87</words>
The colosseum was a dried lake of applause, lined with vendor booths fossilized in dust, where laughter once sold like candied apples. <words>109</words>
By the pattern of fallen leaves traced in the grit, the archer charted the movement of guards and the superstition of their shadows. <words>132</words>
He moved without noise, an arrow with a heartbeat, toward a door decorated with a bent fork nailed like a crooked constellation. <words>154</words>
The fork was his marker, left by a mentor whose compassion had fed strays beneath the bleachers and then vanished beneath rumors. <words>176</words>
Inside waited shelves of ledgers and jars of tokens, the ledger lines whispering debts the park had hidden under cotton candy and thunder. <words>199</words>
He opened a book bound in ticket stubs and found the map of a ringmaster's bargain that traded bones for thrills and bodies for safety. <words>224</words>
This was the dangerous knowledge: a list of names who paid so others need not, and a method to choose the doomed. <words>246</words>
By the pattern of fallen leaves on the stadium floor, the ringmaster had divined which families would be spared, as though mercy were weather. <words>270</words>
The archer felt his cautious impulsiveness flare, a fuse lit by grief and aimlessly passionate yearning to reroute the future without spilling more blood. <words>294</words>
He pocketed the ledger, set the bent fork on a pedestal, and swore to attain a justice kinder than punishment and louder than secrecy. <words>318</words>
A guard turned the corner, and the archer loosed silence itself, arrowing a brass bell so echoes indicted the ceiling instead of the man. <words>342</words>
Startled, the guard dropped a paper airplane whose looped itinerary had been a habit during lonely watches, and it began its final flight. <words>365</words>
As the airplane circled, the archer paced beneath its orbit, timing his choices during the final flight of a paper airplane like a vow. <words>389</words>
He freed the guard with a whisper to flee, slid the ledger into the bell's mouth, and knocked it down a chute marked Lost. <words>413</words>
There, the labyrinth of attractions swallowed the evidence, and a dozen stray cats convened like jurors, their eyes approving as witnesses unbribed. <words>435</words>
When the airplane faltered and kissed the sand, he carved a message with the bent fork on the floor, naming names and absolutions. <words>458</words>
People would find it tomorrow, etched by the pattern of fallen leaves the janitors would sweep aside, and see that mercy can be made. <words>482</words>
Above, the ride lights flickered, honoring a legacy of compassion finally set in motion. <words>496</words></story>
