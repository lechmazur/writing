In the infernal kitchen, heat breathed like a furnace choir, yet the tone of everything was abrasive calm. <words>18</words>
I stood in the space where an apology waits unspoken, tasting smoke, collecting myself like cooled iron. <words>35</words>
Across the preparation table, a distracted guard ignored the bubbling cauldrons and watched his regrets curl like steam. <words>53</words>
He was stationed to keep me from displacing the recipe that binds the world, and he kept forgetting. <words>71</words>
His eyes snagged on the partial spool of ribbon I rolled between my fingers, its frayed end whispering. <words>89</words>
That ribbon once bound a letter I never sent, the letter that valued the price of forgiveness too cheaply. <words>108</words>
Now it measured my pulse, almost radical in how it refused to hide the tremor beneath my poise. <words>126</words>
The guard coughed, distracted by a cloud of peppered vapor, and I asked for water I would not drink. <words>145</words>
He fetched a ladle; I watched the hourglass above the stove churn galaxies of char and ash. <words>162</words>
To outmaneuver cosmic silence, I would read the device by clarifying the swirling patterns inside a dreamlike hourglass. <words>180</words>
Each loop of sand hid a clause, and each clause demanded a debt I feared I could not repay. <words>199</words>
Forgiveness here was currency and wound, priced in memories that scalded like oil cracking over hunger. <words>215</words>
The kitchen hissed with knives, pans, and oddly courteous demons waiting for service bells that never rang. <words>232</words>
I tied the ribbon around my wrist, a tourniquet for doubt, and told the guard I needed another minute. <words>251</words>
He nodded, attention wandering back to the blistered tiles where his reflection hunched like a reprimand. <words>267</words>
I approached the stove, lifted the hourglass, and angled it until the swirl sharpened into legible helixes. <words>284</words>
Their message was simple: move the pot three steps left, displace the shadow, then speak the cost aloud. <words>302</words>
I moved the pot, and the room shifted, revealing a pantry of unserved apologies salted like preserved moons. <words>320</words>
The guard finally focused, seeing his own apology corked on a hook, tagged with the name he would not say. <words>340</words>
He asked what I was cooking, and I told him I was boiling down the cost of my absence. <words>359</words>
Steam wrote arithmetic on the air, and the figures equaled a year of silence traded for one clean sentence. <words>378</words>
I chose to pay, the decision almost radical because it required neither martyrdom nor excuse, only unmistakable clarity. <words>396</words>
So I spoke, a recipe of contrition measured to the gram, and the hourglass stilled like a sealed wound. <words>415</words>
The pantry doors swung open, releasing his tagged apology and mine, which fluttered together like towels surrendering to flame. <words>434</words>
He signed the ledger with a trembling X, and I tied the partial spool of ribbon to its hinge. <words>453</words>
We stood in abrasive calm while the kitchen cooled, both lighter and poorer, having finally bargained with the silence. <words>472</words>
If there was change, it lived beneath our scars, a quiet heat that might keep us humane. <words>489</words>
