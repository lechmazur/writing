<story>Before the first prayer is whispered by a mortal, the nectar collection facility hummed like a hive built of glass and memory, singed by distant comets. <words>26</words>
I, a sentient doll collector, walked the amber corridors carrying a twisted carnival cane that clicked with a sound somewhere between rain and teeth. <words>50</words>
My motions were expectantly resigned, the way a tide accepts the moon yet savors scraping the shore, because destiny still tastes of salt and splinters. <words>75</words>
I had come to uphold a vow: to stride through boundaries once thought sacred, opening sealed wings of the world where dolls and gods mistrusted touch. <words>101</words>
It could only be done by following star paths marked in the nectar's glow, constellations decanted from flowers that bloomed in vacuum and sorrow. <words>125</words>
My dolls were not toys but witnesses, their jointed fingers stained with pollen, their glass eyes reflecting workers born to gather sweetness from the dark. <words>150</words>
From their mouths issued the chorus of healing, a threadbare hymn woven of crackle, lullaby, and small repairs that stitched the air back together. <words>174</words>
Each time my twisted carnival cane struck the grating, comets shed dust like scales, and ethereal grit lifted in spirals that drew maps no atlas dared print. <words>201</words>
The facility's vats, bellied like moons, pulsed with nectar that remembered every flower, every compromise between thorn and mouth, every trembling angle of a wing. <words>226</words>
Beyond them stood the boundary doors, plated in hymn-metal, guarded by custodians whose faces were veiled with honeycomb to muffle the temptation of speaking holiness. <words>251</words>
My dolls sang to those veils, and the veils quivered; the custodians listened, reluctant yet aching, as the chorus of healing mended their ancient unease. <words>276</words>
I was expectantly resigned to their doubt, not angry, because devotion often arrives bruised, staggering under weights it never chose and stories it barely understands. <words>301</words>
So I swung the cane and traced the star paths on the floor, points of light sweating from the nectar vats, until a hidden gate unlatched. <words>327</words>
Stepping through, I felt the world split into before and after, and I vowed to uphold the crossing gently, like cradling a newly unmasked face. <words>352</words>
There, a field spread without horizon where the first breath was learning music, a place expressly kept for becoming, before the first prayer is whispered by a mortal. <words>380</words>
I strode through those once sacred boundaries, my dolls harmonizing repairs in the air, my cane spinning constellations, and I kept going, guided by following star paths toward home. <words>409</words></story>
