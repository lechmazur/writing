I am a meandering bard, catching my breath in a labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain. <words>16</words>
The stacks curl like ancient terraces, and the air tastes of ink, carton dust, and stories that learned to walk uphill. <words>37</words>
I wait during the lull before an apologetic text is sent, thumb hovering over the draft, heartbeat knocking politely. <words>56</words>
If I send it, a door might open; if I do not, another shelf will slide to block the daylight. <words>76</words>
This mountain of pages is my winter camp, a fractured idyll where radiating warmth comes not from fires but from marginalia. <words>97</words>
I have a case lined with velvet, holding dentures rumored to belong to a famous figure, their bite-marked gumline glittering like a crown. <words>120</words>
They are my most credulous audience, and my most dangerous prop. <words>131</words>
With them, I sow unlikely truths through subversive puppet shows in seedy bars tucked into the mountain's shadowy annexes. <words>150</words>
Ordinarily extraordinary, my stage is a napkin and a lamp, my crowd a ring of miners, monks, and honeymooners lost on hikeable aisles. <words>173</words>
I make the dentures sing with the lisp of history, confessing how the famous figure chewed on mercy until it softened like taffy. <words>196</words>
I let the puppet-gnashed vowels nip at their wallets, then their armor, then their shy ribs, until laughter splits open and spills coins. <words>219</words>
Those coins I trade for maps of regrets, and these maps I bring back to the bookstore, laying them between atlases and romances. <words>242</words>
Where the maps touch paper continents, little tremors wander outward, radiating warmth the way steep roots find veins of thaw under snow. <words>264</words>
Hearts grown cold pause, and then they lean, and then they listen, because the mountain listens back whenever someone risks sincerity. <words>285</words>
I am trying to stir hearts grown cold, including the one inside the phone that will receive my apology and maybe spare me silence. <words>309</words>
Before I press send, I rehearse a final set, letting the dentures argue tenderly with a sock about what forgiveness tastes like. <words>331</words>
They decide it tastes of pear cores and tepid tea, a flavor anyone can afford, a flavor that returns after famine. <words>352</words>
Outside, the seedy bars hum awake, but I perform for the stacks, letting my voice thread the aisles like a patient weaver. <words>374</words>
The books bloom as if sewn by sound, and I, ordinarily extraordinary, become a trellis the town can lean on without notice. <words>396</words>
When my phone buzzes its small summer, I send the message, and the mountain exhales, and the dentures grin, and the warmth keeps traveling. <words>420</words>
