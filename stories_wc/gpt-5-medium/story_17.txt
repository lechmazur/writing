With brazen modesty, I admit what I really am: a guilt-ridden black market genealogist. <words>14</words>
I barter maps of bloodlines my clients were never meant to see, then sleep badly. <words>29</words>
To scrub my hands, I walk at dawn, counting breaths like sins, hunting usable truths. <words>44</words>
It was amid morning walks that I found the witch's incantation chamber behind the cemetery wall. <words>60</words>
The door sighed open as if my conscience were a key. <words>71</words>
Candles behaved with an atypically typical steadiness, flames steady like disciplined soldiers pretending not to shake. <words>87</words>
At the center waited a chipped bowl etched with family crests, some of them illegal to name. <words>104</words>
Every death notice I had stolen seemed to hover above it, a hesitant murder of paper birds. <words>121</words>
I had made fortunes by analyzing the subtext in funeral eulogies, hearing the names left unsaid, tracing their shadows. <words>140</words>
The chamber corrected me with silence, the sharp kind that makes humility sweat. <words>153</words>
I asked the bowl for a map that led not to lineage, but to forgiveness. <words>168</words>
The surface shivered, and I zoom toward my past, towns and faces shrinking from my gaze. <words>184</words>
There was the night I charted a prince's bastard line for a crime lord, smiling like a clerk. <words>202</words>
There was the morning I swapped siblings to save a dying heiress and ruin a kinder sister. <words>219</words>
Each story glittered, then turned to ash around the rim, falling into the bowl like snowfall. <words>235</words>
I wanted absolution, but the chamber kept offering beginnings, as if guilt were compost. <words>249</words>
I understood: I stood on the brink of renewal, if I would step without lying. <words>264</words>
So I wrote names I should never share, not to sell, but to return to the unmothered and unacknowledged. <words>283</words>
I carried the lists out of the chamber and into the day, bold and almost anonymous. <words>299</words>
During those deliveries, I spoke with brazen modesty, admitting my part, declining payment, locking eyes only when they trembled. <words>318</words>
Some cursed me, some held me, and one old man touched my cheek as if checking a mirror for breath. <words>338</words>
When doubt swarmed, I returned to the chipped bowl and recopied names until the letters steadied. <words>354</words>
The chamber taught me small spells that were really disciplines: inventory, candor, and staying long enough to hear thanks or fury. <words>375</words>
It asked nothing except that I continue walking at dawn, returning before the city woke fully. <words>391</words>
On those paths, amid morning walks, I learned to listen for futures breathing between sparrows and shoes. <words>408</words>
Families reunited, grudges softened, and a few new lies bloomed that I refused to water. <words>423</words>
I am still a guilt-ridden black market genealogist, only now my market trades in daylight and apologies. <words>440</words>
I do not ask to be forgiven; I ask to be useful enough that forgiveness might someday catch up. <words>459</words>
That is how the witch's incantation chamber remade me, slowly, sternly, and utterly, one list at a time. <words>477</words>
I keep walking toward the bowl each dawn, because the only path to self-forgiveness is the one you take twice. <words>497</words>
