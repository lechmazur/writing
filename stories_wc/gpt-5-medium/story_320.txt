I read tides like timid prayers, the shy diviner nobody notices until the lights fail.<words>15</words>
In the forgotten underwater city market, I set up a stall between rusted anchors and barnacled clocks.<words>32</words>
The water presses like memory, heavy, wavering, yet confusingly clear.<words>42</words>
People drift through with oxygen coins, trading vintage photographs that survived pockets, floods, and forgetfulness.<words>57</words>
They want fortunes, but I offer receipts, because the echo of regret prefers proper documentation.<words>72</words>
Across parallel timelines, I slide their images into brine-lit trays and watch futures precipitate like salt.<words>88</words>
I am motivated not by benevolence, but by the itch to right a cosmic imbalance that scratches inside my skull.<words>108</words>
Passionate disinterest sounds impossible until your heart becomes a meticulous archivist and your pulse loses its curiosity.<words>125</words>
I scroll a trail of social media posts revealing a hidden truth the market forgets every hour.<words>142</words>
Accounts from other currents tag the same faces in different drownings, and the timelines braid like kelp.<words>159</words>
Every like is a buoy on an alternate grief, every comment a finger pointing toward neglected proof.<words>176</words>
The photographs refuse silence, and their emulsions whisper coordinates that my bones interpret as aching directions.<words>192</words>
A child holding a scarlet kite appears in three realities, flying it toward different stalls, none selling string.<words>210</words>
In one, she pays with oxygen coins that bear a monarch's profile; in another, with shells marked as taxes.<words>229</words>
In the darkest branch, she pays nothing and the kite pulls her upward into an elevator of bubbles that never opens.<words>250</words>
Regret echoes from those doors, repeating my name in a dialect I only know when asleep.<words>266</words>
If I nudge events, the market survives; if I hesitate, the city becomes a museum with no docents.<words>284</words>
So I speak to the kite, not the child, because objects forgive schedules, and children remember the shape of blame.<words>304</words>
I instruct it to snag on the barnacled clocks until the other timelines catch up, until air chooses mercy.<words>323</words>
The kite obeys in two worlds and rebels in one, and the difference precipitates a storm in my lungs.<words>342</words>
I exhale coins into her palm, an impossible wage, and the monarch's profile softens into the child's reflection.<words>360</words>
The trail online brightens, posts adjusting, captions correcting themselves as if embarrassed by their earlier certainty.<words>376</words>
Someone types, 'She bought string,' and the echo of regret, stubborn archivist, finally files my name under pending.<words>394</words>
The market brightens by a shade only divers notice, a confusingly clear rinse of light over the wares.<words>412</words>
I fold the remaining vintage photographs into my case, listening for the future to stop sounding like footsteps behind me.<words>432</words>
Across the timelines, the kite catches, the door opens halfway, and the bubbles learn the grammar of release.<words>450</words>
I will never be noticed, which is good, because notice would only precipitate more imbalance, and I am tired of scratching.<words>471</words>
The city forgets me, the child breathes, and the market sells string until night, when regret returns to inventory.<words>490</words>
