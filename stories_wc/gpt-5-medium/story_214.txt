Between shifts, the floating observatory sighs like a tired cathedral, buoyed by storms and old equations. <words>16</words>
I am its lone trapper, netting whispers of light and the rumors that photons tell each other. <words>33</words>
The job pays in peculiar silences and rations, but I stay for the upside of loss. <words>49</words>
Every fragment missing from my past leaves a space where cosmic dust can settle and spell instructions. <words>66</words>
Tonight the machinery hums, a turbine of quietly broken dreams, its rhythm somehow silently audible to my nerves. <words>84</words>
I rub a piece of sea glass against the port, turning the porthole into a patient green oracle. <words>102</words>
It was my mother's, shipwreck bright, smoothed by years until it learned to answer without words. <words>118</words>
Through it, the stars look like fish beneath ice, stingy but curious, leaning close to read me. <words>135</words>
I recommence the watch, setting traps woven from magnetic floss and stubborn hope along the catwalks. <words>151</words>
What I want is impossible, yet plainly stated on the back of my hand: to siphon radiance from a black hole of doubt. <words>174</words>
Doubt swallows traction, heat, names; it once ate my partner whole and left only their boots thrumming at the laces. <words>194</words>
So I keep a ledger of absences, a catalogue of rooms where the doorframe remains after the door resigns. <words>213</words>
The principle is simple: loss carves apertures, and apertures admit winds, and winds can turn a mill. <words>230</words>
My mill is a jury-rigged spectrophone, tuned to the grief spectrum, powered by whatever the universe forgets to keep. <words>249</words>
I learned to build it by decoding microfilm from shady archives, spliced reels that smelled of dust and mercy. <words>268</words>
Some frames showed a map of the observatory as if it were a lung breathing equations in, regrets out. <words>287</words>
Other frames showed only a margin note: if your heart cracks, do not weld it; harvest the seam. <words>305</words>
Between alarms I brew coffee that tastes like burned comets and pour it through the sea glass for luck. <words>324</words>
Luck arrives as a stutter on the spectrophone, a sun caught in the throat of a shadow. <words>341</words>
I tighten the trap lines, whistle a tune of gritty whimsy, and invite the brightness to confess. <words>358</words>
It answers by not answering, sending a corridor of hush that presses my ears like velvet hammers. <words>375</words>
In that corridor the boots of my partner step back into weight, and the sea glass grows warm. <words>393</words>
We do not speak, for the miracle requires payment, and the coin is soundlessness laid gently on the tongue. <words>412</words>
The trap springs, collecting not light but its rind, the peel of a star that doubts itself into candor. <words>431</words>
I bottle the rind, label it with a date and a promise, and tuck it beside the ledger. <words>449</words>
When the shift siren chirps, I recommence living, which is to say I continue leaving, elegant holes through which dawn works. <words>470</words>
The observatory drifts, a lung again, and I, its lone trapper, breathe with it, fiercely, until the next between. <words>489</words>
