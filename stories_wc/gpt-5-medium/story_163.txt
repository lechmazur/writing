I arrived at the xenobiology research station as the migration of clouds began, a lost heiress with bitterly optimistic poise. <words>20</words>
Earlier, a detour to avoid traffic led me to a scenic overlook where the sky fissured like glass and invited risk. <words>41</words>
In the overlook breeze I found an old parking stub in my pocket, relic of a city that mislabeled me. <words>61</words>
I wanted to push the limits of possibility, so I funded this station and hid among interns, charting fragmented reality. <words>81</words>
With reckless precision, I wrote protocols like stitches, hoping to unify the fractures that split species, seasons, and selves. <words>100</words>
During the migration of clouds, the atmosphere rippled, and every organism we studied flickered between anatomies, like multilingual bodies mid-sentence. <words>120</words>
The parking stub became my focusing talisman, a numbered square reminding me that entrances and exits depend on vantage. <words>139</words>
A junior scientist named Iri confronted me about the hidden lineage, her voice equal parts suspicion and need for mentorship. <words>159</words>
I told her I was lost, that heiress was a map with no roads, a traffic jam of expectations without detours. <words>180</words>
Iri laughed, bitterly optimistic, and said the universe only asks for coordinates, not pedigrees, then handed me a broken sensor. <words>200</words>
I repaired it with reckless precision, threading the stub's perforations over the sensor's lightport to calibrate absence against presence. <words>219</words>
The readout translated the creatures' pulses into mosaics, and among their tessellations I recognized my own biography, cut and rearranged. <words>239</words>
We decided to unify our findings into a single continuum, timing snapshots to the cloud caravans as if they were clocks. <words>260</words>
At lunch I drove back to the scenic overlook, aligning horizon markers, remembering the detour to avoid traffic that brought revelation. <words>281</words>
There I swore to steward the research with my ruined surname, pouring funds like rain to shelter the migrants we studied. <words>302</words>
The parent corporation arrived seeking patents on sentience, and I signed injunctions with my true name, detonating secrecy with purpose. <words>322</words>
When the clouds parted like migrating gates, the station hummed, and our sensor resolved a single being braided from many possibles. <words>343</words>
I asked it how to become whole when every inheritance argues, and it answered: stand where angles meet, then listen. <words>363</words>
So I returned to the overlook, used the stub's number as a coordinate, and unified my lives by choosing directions deliberately. <words>384</words>
I narrate this with reckless precision because the clouds still migrate, reality fragments less loudly, and our station keeps possibility honest. <words>405</words>
