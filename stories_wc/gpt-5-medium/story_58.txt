I climb the moth observation tower while the city's lights flicker after an unexpected outage, and the rails hum with a prayer I barely know. <words>25</words>
Tonight I serve as a fiercely loyal scout for our scattered neighborhood, posted above the streets like a guardian with cold hands. <words>47</words>
My orders are simple and strange, to watch the moths swirl and to learn meditation techniques from their patient orbiting. <words>67</words>
The city below thrums with sanctified dread, as if every siren were a choirboy who misplaced his halo in the blackout. <words>88</words>
On my lap rests an engraved bullet journal cover, its leather pitted and luminous, with the words balance inside storms carved as a dare. <words>112</words>
I run my thumb over the grooves, as though the lines could press their quiet geometry into my anxious breath. <words>132</words>
Down in the blackout comedy club, Juno riffs on pigeons and parking tickets, trying to radicalize the lonely via coded nonsense in comedic routines. <words>156</words>
I am her lookout, and I am individually common, one more witness, one more heartbeat, but my loyalty burns like a small lawful star. <words>180</words>
The moths keep a perimeter where the tower lantern should be, tasting darkness as if it were a manuscript of salt and moon. <words>203</words>
Their wings school my pulse, and I practice balancing inside storms by following each erratic orbit until it feels like a breath returning. <words>226</words>
Meditation, the old scoutmaster said, is not escape, but observation sharpened until mercy can be measured by wingbeats. <words>244</words>
So I watch the power grids stutter, hear laughter erupt in ragged intervals below, and time my inhale to the intervals no one else blesses. <words>269</words>
Juno slips coded names for our neighbors into punchlines, and each applause masks a warning for the community patrols now crawling the dark. <words>292</words>
My radio crackles with a cipher we built from insect taxonomy, ridiculous on its face, but pure function when the sirens spin too close. <words>316</words>
I flip open the journal, and the engraved bullet journal cover mirrors a faint constellated city, as if the leather held the lost electricity. <words>340</words>
I write, Practice stillness amid jokes that carry codes, carry neighbors, carry heat, because the holiest dread is the kind that keeps you awake and human. <words>366</words>
When the patrol van halts beneath the tower, I steady my breath, send the signal to Juno, and feel the moths tighten like a velvet drum. <words>392</words>
Below, she turns a pratfall into a benediction, and the room kneels in laughter, while my whisper travels the wire that tells her when to end, when to survive. <words>421</words>
I breathe with the moths to the syllables of her closing joke, letting the fear crown me, yet refusing to abdicate the small thrones of kindness we guard. <words>449</words>
