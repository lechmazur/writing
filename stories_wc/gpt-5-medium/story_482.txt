I am an insomniac painter in an arboreal workshop suspended among giant mushrooms, where the air hums with a peacefully chaotic tremor of spores and brushes. <words>26</words>
Nights pass as I devour colors like sugared thunder, chasing the mistake that keeps me awake even when my bones plead for the soft blackout of sleep. <words>53</words>
On a peg hangs a tapered wizard's hat with a bullet hole, a souvenir from a carnival duel where applause misfired and fate corrected the aim. <words>79</words>
I wear it only when I must remember what lives behind the painted smiles, and tonight the fabric whispers like a tilted hourglass. <words>102</words>
After midnight, I scry in puddles gathered on the caps, mirror moons where brushstrokes foretell mischief, apology, and the next place my courage refuses to go. <words>128</words>
The water laughs in frolicsome regret, showing me a desk under chalk dust during the hush of an empty classroom at first light, and a window painted closed. <words>156</words>
Years ago I taught myself there, alone, practicing letters until they turned to birds, certain that if they took flight I would outlast the final obstacle. <words>182</words>
But the obstacle learned my tricks, and now it lurks between pigments, a patient storm that waits for my hand to shake and my line to lie. <words>209</words>
So I paint the classroom as the puddles devour their own reflections, each gulp leaving a truer shadow, each shadow asking me to trade sleep for a sharper question. <words>238</words>
The hat steadies me; through the bullet hole I sight my canvas, a round eclipse that reframes the world into something I can almost forgive. <words>263</words>
Behind those painted smiles I have hidden maps, and behind the maps, small doorways that open onto the mushroom bridges and the restless, forgiving dirt. <words>288</words>
At first light the puddles close their eyes, and the classroom breathes, and a silhouette steps from the chalkboard, a teacher made of smudge who asks what I forgot to learn. <words>319</words>
I answer that I wish to outlast the final obstacle, the storm with my handwriting, the loneliness that sneaks into pigments and tells them to abandon me before the ending. <words>349</words>
She smiles and peels it back, and behind the painted smiles there is a ringing playground, a bell tied with ivy, and my name written correctly on a stolen hall pass. <words>380</words>
We both laugh, peacefully chaotic as wind among gills, and I climb the rope ladders to my canvas, leaving the wizard's hat on a nail to keep lookout. <words>408</words>
First light slips through the bullet hole and lands like a coin in a wishing pond, and I begin again, devour the doubt, and paint a doorway we can exit through laughing. <words>440</words>
