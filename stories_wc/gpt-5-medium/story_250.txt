I arrived at the forgotten library inside a deserted temple with anxious elation trembling like a lantern flame cupped against stormy breath. <words>22</words>
I am a blunt heretic, enthusiastically cautious despite the rumors, and I carried a worn-out teddy bear pressed to my ribs like contraband. <words>45</words>
Its stitched smile once guarded old promises I made to my mentor, promises to never bow again to gleaming certainties or velveted lies. <words>68</words>
Tonight, at the hush when a long-lost puzzle piece reappears, the bear's button eye reflected a square of light shivering across dust. <words>90</words>
In an alcove, an outdated stock ticker chattered nonsense, spooling jumbled codes like rosary beads, anachronistic prayer for a market no longer breathing. <words>113</words>
I had come to match wits with an omniscient mind rumored to speak through those jumbled codes, a god of indexes, dividends, and forgotten names. <words>138</words>
I was enthusiastically cautious, checking exits, testing floorboards, then grinning, because every battle needs rhythm, and doubt keeps the tempo honest. <words>159</words>
I set the teddy bear beside the ticker, a sacrament of moth-stuffed courage, and repeated my old promises quietly so the shelves could overhear. <words>183</words>
The machine spat a pattern reminiscent of a chess opening, but sideways, and I answered by moving books on the table as if they were pieces. <words>209</words>
Prices became syllables, indexes became intonations, and the library hummed agreement, filling me with anxious elation as though I were finally hearing my native tongue. <words>234</words>
The omniscient mind tested me: What is certainty without faith, and faith without certainty, heretic; and I answered bluntly, Both are currencies inflated by comfort. <words>259</words>
The ticker flickered, then slowed, as if the temple itself held its breath, and the real question arrived, the reappearing piece shaped like my mentor's absence. <words>285</words>
Would I break my old promises to revive him, rewriting truth as charity, or keep them and let his betrayal remain carved into silence? <words>309</words>
Enthusiastically cautious, I chose the battle of wits over mercy, placing the bear on a higher shelf like a witness, refusing easy absolution masquerading as love. <words>335</words>
Through the jumbled codes in an outdated stock ticker, I encoded my rebuttal, assigning delisted companies to lost verses, dividends to debts of breath and blood. <words>361</words>
The omniscient mind replied by rearranging books and rippling dust into tiny eddies like armies, and our battle finally stood visible, strategy underlined in ash. <words>386</words>
I refused every trade that bought certainty with erased memory, and the ticker hiccupped, conceding parity, while anxious elation flooded me with the steadiness of earned doubt. <words>413</words>
I tucked the puzzle piece into the teddy bear's seam, kept my old promises intact, and left the library as it exhaled, ready for tomorrow's questions. <words>439</words>
