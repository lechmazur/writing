<story>The abandoned waiting area kept a screaming silence that clung like coal dust to my lungs. <words>16</words>
I sat on a cold bench, a subdued vigilante who preferred restraint over spectacle, and watched my cracked screen light with incoming virtual calls. <words>40</words>
The callers were generals, brokers, and ghosts, all of them bargaining over the price of war as if fury were a currency. <words>62</words>
They hired me to find traitors in their ranks, and I accepted to master an ancient art my teacher called the Mirror Way. <words>85</words>
I would trace liars not by their faces but by tracking distortions in an antique funhouse mirror I propped against the timetable board. <words>108</words>
The mirror was salvaged from a shuttered carnival near the docks, its bent glass mapping tremors in speech the way isobars map storms. <words>131</words>
During virtual calls, a truthful voice stayed narrow, but deceit smeared into oily crescents that slithered across the reflected tiles behind me. <words>153</words>
I kept a plain wooden bead in my palm to feel the rhythm of their words, the old anchor that steadied my artfully clumsy hands. <words>178</words>
Every groove in that bead had been earned in trenches where radios lied, and the mirror gave me back what the war had stolen. <words>202</words>
When a colonel appeared onscreen, I had to flatter him, praising his doctrine as the reflection ballooned, revealing a chasm between his tone and truth. <words>227</words>
He asked about timelines, and I answered with patient nods, letting the narrow corridor behind me turn to waves that showed where his promise would drown. <words>253</words>
My teacher used to say the price of war is paid in memory first, then in names, then in the rooms we dare not enter. <words>278</words>
This waiting area had been one such room, emptied of travel and full of the screaming silence of partings that nobody could afford to make public. <words>304</words>
I trained here because the ghosts liked honest games, because the benches fixed my spine, and because the cracked clock refused to hurry my learning. <words>329</words>
To master the ancient art, I practiced being seen badly, moving in ways that looked accidental, the artfully clumsy dance that hid my listening. <words>353</words>
So when the broker called to auction a ceasefire, his face appeared thin as a blade, but the mirror wrinkled around the pixels like a wound. <words>379</words>
I told him he was a visionary, and my flattery guided the slime of distortion to the doorway where a gun waited offscreen. <words>402</words>
The wooden bead clicked once, and I knew the ceasefire would fail, because the buyer needed the war to keep paying his debts. <words>425</words>
I muted myself, entered the corridor, and tripped artfully, knocking the mirror to tilt just enough that the shot meant for a witness bit concrete. <words>450</words>
When I returned, breath held in the hush, I told them the traitor was gone, and the mirror finally narrowed, conceding one small victory to silence. <words>476</words>
The calls ended, the station stayed empty, and I rubbed the bead, counting grooves like debts, knowing mastery demanded I pay without applause. <words>499</words>
