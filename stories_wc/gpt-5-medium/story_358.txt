<story>During playground time inside the arctic research greenhouse, an old-fashioned mage stepped from a wavering reflection on a humidity gauge.<words>20</words>
He had wandered purposefully aimless across ice corridors of the station, letting mirrors decide his path, like lodestars disguised as glass.<words>41</words>
Each pane offered an ephemeral encounter with mirror reflections, quick as cold breath, and through them he gleaned omens like auroras folded inward.<words>64</words>
In his mittened hand he carried a fragment of a pharaoh's coffin, scarab inlay chipped but still whispering cartilage-dry prayers.<words>84</words>
The scientists' children were busy with chalky hopscotch between citrus trees, their laughter threading halos through the steam and frost.<words>104</words>
Playground time had been moved indoors for months, and the greenhouse hummed like a cathedral whose choir feared to breathe too loudly.<words>126</words>
The mage bowed to the children, old-fashioned as a lantern, and asked whether any frost had been spelling riddles on their watering cans.<words>149</words>
A girl with fox-red earmuffs nodded, pointing to a mirror propped behind a lemon sapling, where letters unfurled inside fog like seedlings.<words>171</words>
The unfolding riddle read, Seek the frontier that hides in embrace, where fear lies still and heat remembers its own birth.<words>192</words>
Sanctified dread crept over them, not terror but reverence for the cold that keeps the world precise, a liturgy of crystals.<words>213</words>
He explained that the coffin fragment was a compass for places maps refuse, tuned to warmth hidden inside braided shadows.<words>233</words>
To claim an uncharted frontier, he said, one must move through ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections until every glance learns to bear silence.<words>256</words>
Only then could the riddle unfold into a door, and only a gentle act would turn its frozen handle.<words>275</words>
The girl shivered, and he asked permission to cuddle her a moment, so their shared heat might coax the compass to speak.<words>297</words>
Held against his wool coat, she watched the mirror hazing, and in its fog the coffin fragment shone like a coal from buried noon.<words>321</words>
Around them, the children fell quiet, crab apples of breath forming and breaking, as the greenhouse seemed to kneel upon the permafrost.<words>343</words>
The riddle continued, not in words now, but in a procession of paired reflections where each child met their double and forgave its tremor.<words>367</words>
Through those fleeting congresses the mage located the seam, a nowhere edge, the frontier the riddle demanded, present only when compassion warmed a mirror.<words>391</words>
He touched the fragment to the glass, and the image yawned like a sanctum, frost writing hieroglyphs that translated as home that has not happened yet.<words>417</words>
Claiming it did not mean possession, he told them, but a vow to cultivate the tenderness that opens passages where maps see only panes.<words>441</words>
The children nodded as if knighted, and resumed their games with a new rule, that every reflection deserved a partner and a pause.<words>464</words>
Satisfied, the old-fashioned mage retreated purposefully aimless into the next reflective hush, while the greenhouse stood like a benediction on the sharpened white.<words>487</words></story>
