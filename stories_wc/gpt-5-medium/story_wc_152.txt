<story>I arrived at the cobalt observatory in autumn with a satchel of needles and dark silk. [16]
They call me a galaxy-chart embroiderer, though I swear I mostly listen. [28]
Listening is my craft, because every stitch follows rumor, and rumor is a wandering star. [43]
I came before the coup, when the domes sighed and the brass rails knew our palms. [59]
The halls kept an echoed silence that made each breath seem rehearsed and still unfinished. [74]
I had been invited by a keeper who trusted fools and knew I was pretending. [89]
He believed my quips and dropped stitches hid a map to what no one else heard. [105]
I disguise wisdom as foolishness because truth slips past when dressed like a jester. [119]
I came to listen for unheard stories floating in the telescopes like trapped birds. [133]
Some stories are patient enough to roost; some peck until they draw their own blood. [148]
The keeper led me to a small desk where an eternal candle had been burning. [163]
He cupped the flame from eternal candle with a glass glove, and the room exhaled. [178]
I threaded midnight silk and asked him to tell me nothing, only to let me listen. [194]
He nodded, and the heavens ticked, and dust made constellations over the unused charts. [208]
I began to stitch what I heard, not with sound, but with the pauses between. [223]
Each gap revealed a path that ran through adjacent possibilities, corridors beside corridors, doors beside doors. [239]
When paths run that close, you can synchronize them with a timid fingertip and a prayer. [255]
The cloth trembled as if the sky were cold and wanted a shawl to hold it. [271]
From those shivers rose a pattern like ivy, teasing the edges of the dome. [285]
The keeper, pretending disinterest, polished the eyepiece, but his wrist quivered against the brass. [299]
I pricked my finger, dabbed the thread with red, and the candle flame contracted. [313]
The pattern opened a throat in the cloth, and from it a whisper climbed. [327]
The whisper told me that star charts had been falsified by careful hands and careful silences. [343]
Ships were sent to empty coordinates while freight moved under the auroras, invisible to the ledgers. [359]
Those who knew rephrased their knowledge as jokes, and those who suspected laughed to stay alive. [375]
I recognized my own mask in theirs and stitched the jester hat above the pole star. [391]
Unraveling conspiracies is not cutting; it is easing the knot until it sighs open. [405]
So I loosened threads where the falsified routes crossed, and soft laughter leaked from them. [420]
The keeper set down his cloth, and we watched truth hover like a moth. [434]
It circled the eternal candle, alighting on the glass glove, leaving a powder of ash. [449]
In the ash I drew a coastline and wrote two names that refused to stay. [464]
The names were positions, not people, chairs whose occupants rotated while the music pretended oblivion. [479]
How soon, I asked the keeper, will the music stop, and which chairs will break. [494]
He stared into the dome and said, the coup rehearses each night in the dust. [509]
We listened to that rehearsal as if it were rain on a roof we shared. [524]
The flame from eternal candle bent left, then right, as though counting the uncounted footsteps. [539]
To map the footsteps, I had to let the cloth suffer, tugging until constellations realigned. [554]
When threads snapped, I gathered their ends and invited them to meet like forgiving relatives. [569]
Their reunion made a new current, and I let it pass through me without ownership. [584]
The observatory thrummed, a low cello under the stars, and the candle whispered a measure. [599]
We synchronized our breathing to it, and the doors along the corridors clicked like teeth. [614]
Somewhere a ratcheting lock chose its side, and then the whisper hardened into speech. [628]
You will be blamed, it said, because only the fool is permitted to be everywhere. [643]
I nodded, because blame is a kind of thread, and fools stitch kingdoms back together. [658]
I asked the keeper for water, and he returned with a cup of starwash. [672]
We doused the ash drawing, but the names had already slipped into the fibers. [686]
They would stain the cloth until the coup finished, or failed, depending on who listened. [701]
I tucked the embroidery into my satchel and promised to carry its rumor safely. [715]
Outside, the maple leaves clacked like beads, keeping time for a choir we could not see. [731]
The keeper asked what I wanted for payment, and I told him a place to sleep. [747]
Sleep is how I travel through adjacent possibilities when walking would be too noisy. [761]
In dreams I hear floors whisper secrets that stairs cannot carry, and I file them carefully. [777]
Before I closed my eyes, I set the eternal candle near the window to watch. [792]</story>
