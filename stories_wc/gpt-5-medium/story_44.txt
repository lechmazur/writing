I am a feisty stablehand who grooms ghosts of machinery rather than horses, sweeping orbital rust into piles inside my space debris art studio. <words>24</words>
Most days happen amid car rides between scrapyards and clients, the windows blurry with starlight reflections from bits of broken satellites humming past our city. <words>49</words>
On the passenger seat rests an antique oil lamp, its brass wick-housing polished by patience, reminding me to preserve ancient methods before algorithms grind them into dust. <words>76</words>
My mind stays intellectually playful, setting riddles for myself about torque, patina, and the stubborn metaphors clinging to bolts the way burrs cling to manes. <words>101</words>
I catalogue flavors of salvage via half-torn tickets from a forgotten carnival booth, each ticket tagged to a story that directs my hands. <words>124</words>
With them I morph waste into witness, letting their faded numbers dictate the order of rivets, the sequence of hammer strikes, the timing of breath. <words>149</words>
Redemptive acts, I have learned, are rarely loud; they sound like a wick catching, a screw unseizing, a wheel finally remembering its circle. <words>172</words>
I move with quietly bold care, the way a stablehand calms a skittish colt, stroking nerves back into rhythm with tools warmed by breath. <words>196</words>
Inside the studio, hull fragments lean like winter trees, while circuit boards dusted in lunar grit wait to become constellations set in welded filigree. <words>220</words>
Between commissions I ride shotgun to auctions, trading jokes with drivers who think art from space junk is cute until they see tears on buyers' cheeks. <words>246</words>
Today a philosopher ordered a lamp, asking for the antique oil lamp's soul to be coaxed into a satellite skin without losing its smoky grammar. <words>271</words>
I chose the blue ticket whose numeral was half obliterated, and let its torn edge morph into a template for the lamp's bezel. <words>294</words>
I once stripped a carousel for parts during a hungry winter, and every weld now answers that theft with a softer, steadier turn of light. <words>319</words>
These are my redemptive acts: patient alignment, jokes whispered to wires, a willingness to fail without flinching until the piece breathes like an animal. <words>343</words>
On the next car ride, the driver asks why somebody from barns bothers with satellites, and I tell him ancient methods need new wind to survive. <words>369</words>
Preserving is not freezing, I say, it is an intellectually playful choreography where traditions learn new steps without losing the beat that steadies their hooves. <words>394</words>
Back at the studio, I light the finished lamp, oil licking cotton, brass warm as a flank, and shadows gallop across plating newly burnished. <words>418</words>
Through the window, debris drifts like quiet confetti, and I ride the night without moving, a feisty stablehand redeemed by the gentle work of morphing worlds. <words>444</words>
