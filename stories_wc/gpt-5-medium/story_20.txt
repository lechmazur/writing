<story>
I arrived at the inverted waterfall by accident, an unplanned stop at a roadside attraction while the planets rehearsed their slow dance overhead. <words>23</words>
Water ascended the cliff like a gleaming spine, and mist drifted downward, a contradiction I understood better than I liked. <words>43</words>
I am a disappointed archer, my bow unstrung, traveling from march to march to chronicle social movements with passionate disinterest. <words>63</words>
The crowds I follow believe, and I record, anxiously calm in the face of slogans that beg to become arrows. <words>83</words>
At the waterfall I saw a narrow span of black basalt arching through the mist, a sign naming it the bridge of regret. <words>106</words>
A docent in a raincoat whispered that the bridge appeared only during the slow dance of celestial bodies, when orbits tugged invisible strings. <words>129</words>
I crossed, feeling gravity revise itself, and the ascending river hissed like old film spooling backward through a projector. <words>148</words>
Midway, I met a woman brushing her hair with a tarnished silver comb, each stroke releasing a memory that flowed upward with the water. <words>172</words>
She said the bridge collected what people could not carry, so the river could lift it back to the heavens as proof. <words>194</words>
I told her I came to confront my notes, pages of crowds reduced to statistics and chants clipped like feathers. <words>214</words>
She handed me the comb and asked me to drag it through the river of air above us, where droplets climbed like sparks. <words>237</words>
Doing so unearthed the faces I had filed away, the janitor who organized a strike, the grandmother whose lullabies were petitions in disguise. <words>260</words>
They hovered around us, asking not for advocacy but for accuracy, and my anxious calm felt suddenly honest rather than evasive. <words>281</words>
The woman smiled like a bruise healing, and said that regret was only a bridge when someone dared to walk both directions. <words>303</words>
On the far side, a small booth waited, another roadside attraction trinket stand, selling postcards of constellations and empty frames for apologies. <words>325</words>
I bought none, but I wrote names in my ledger, and for once the letters refused to march in tidy, indifferent lines. <words>347</words>
The woman returned the comb to her pocket, and I returned to the middle, where the bridge of regret remembers and forgets in alternating pulses. <words>372</words>
There I strung my bow again, not to aim at anyone, but to measure distance, the only honest target left to me. <words>394</words>
Above, the galaxies continued their rehearsal, and I promised to witness without pretending to lead. <words>409</words>
When I finally left, it was during the slow dance of celestial bodies, and my notes walked beside me like patient, ascending water. <words>432</words>
