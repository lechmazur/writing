<story>While the old projector flickers in an abandoned movie house at the foot of the magnetic mountain, I laugh with frolicsome regret.<words>22</words> I am the unknowing heir to a story written in iron filings and whispers, though nobody remembered to send an invitation.<words>43</words> Tonight, I hold a tarnished silver spoon like a conductor's baton, coaxing silence to reveal its tempo and appetite.<words>62</words> The quiet hunger hums between scoops of dusty light, a small ache that pretends innocence and negotiates nothing.<words>80</words> On the torn screen, the mountain's silhouette seems to churn, not with weather, but with a patient magnetism longing for company.<words>101</words> I stage a one-person matinee, intent to co-author a future with chaos, the only collaborator that can improvise sincerity.<words>120</words> Chaos arrives as static, then as memory, and finally as a draft of wind that flips the seating chart of my heart.<words>142</words> I peel at a faded wall, and through the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals, ancestors watch, bemused and expectant.<words>163</words> Their faces glow when the projector misfires, as if the mountain itself magnetizes their pigments into motion, aligning us like filings.<words>184</words> Someone painted a spoon in the mural, and suddenly the one in my pocket remembers a mouth it never fed.<words>204</words> I lick the metal, tasting storms and kitchens, a trivially monumental sacrament that blesses nothing and yet blesses me.<words>223</words> The theater seats creak like old boats, and I imagine row after row launching toward a coastline charted by errant compasses.<words>244</words> To follow, I must stop asking whose crown fits, and start asking which crown dissolves nicely in the mouth of gravity.<words>265</words> The mountain tugs at nails, watches, and thoughts, magnetizing me until I lean forward, listening for the blood's small applause.<words>285</words> I raise the spoon to the beam, and the light pours in, a river seeking the andante of an unseen conductor.<words>306</words> Every scratch becomes a corridor, every dent a door, and I walk through the utensil's history like a delighted trespasser.<words>326</words> In those corridors, the quiet hunger keeps time, clicking its tongue, teaching me how to starve for only the right things.<words>347</words> So I draft a treaty with chaos, clause by giggling clause, promising to be brave enough to misfile certainty under fantasy.<words>368</words> If I am heir, I inherit motion, and the right to choose my orbit, even when the compass laughs behind my back.<words>390</words> When the reel flaps and darkness pools, I kiss the spoon and step outside, the mountain's pull and my intentions finally aligned.<words>412</words></story>
