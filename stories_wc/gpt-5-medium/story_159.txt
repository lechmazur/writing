<story>
I was a homeless philosopher-king before the city forgot its own corridors. <words>12</words>
They led inward like a sandstone labyrinth with floating lanterns, bright as moth-baited moons hovering over parchment walls. <words>30</words>
People came for tours; I came to puzzle out a labyrinth once thought unsolvable. <words>44</words>
During readings of municipal myths, I mapped echoes instead of paths, listening for the syllables stone keeps. <words>61</words>
My method was earnestly frivolous, like a child counting stars to calculate gravity. <words>74</words>
I would extend questions the way one extends a palm to rain, and wait for pattern. <words>90</words>
My only instrument was a weather-beaten kaleidoscope the wind had traded me for a lie I swore was truth. <words>109</words>
Through it, shards of lantern light rearranged the corridors into proposals, each turning a possibility of home. <words>126</words>
So I traveled the city, earning coin and clues through confetti-coded proposals at random weddings. <words>141</words>
I would stand by the cake, propose to fate with colored slips, and watch which confetti the couples gravitated toward. <words>161</words>
Blue meant take the left-hand arch; gold meant wait; white meant surrender your name to the next echo. <words>179</words>
The newlyweds laughed, but their laughter mapped currents that carried me back to the labyrinth like a tide of rice. <words>199</words>
At night I slept under an arch where the lanterns hummed, a throne of wrapped blankets and borrowed oaths. <words>218</words>
I told the stones their city could be ruled by complex simplicity, and they offered me riddles minted from dust. <words>238</words>
One riddle loved me back and betrayed me: a guide named Lio, whose smile was an alley with two exits. <words>258</words>
He promised a map if I would crown him with the kaleidoscope and call him king when crowds gathered for readings. <words>279</words>
I agreed, earnestly frivolous as ever, and the lanterns applauded like low stars. <words>292</words>
When I lifted the kaleidoscope to his brow, colors fractured into a coronation of mirrors that showed me vanishing. <words>311</words>
Lio turned, bowed to the crowd, and declared me solved, then left with my instrument and the map I never saw. <words>332</words>
It was a transformative betrayal, as if the maze itself had removed its mask to reveal my face behind it. <words>352</words>
Without the kaleidoscope, I learned to extend silence like a rope and climb the hush between lantern flickers. <words>370</words>
I proposed to the empty air, exchanging confetti no one saw, and the labyrinth proposed back with a corridor I had missed. <words>392</words>
The passage ended at a courtyard where lanterns floated in a spiral like a gentle throat clearing itself for speech. <words>412</words>
There, the city returned my weather-beaten kaleidoscope in the form of a reflection pooled in rainwater, and I accepted the crown of absence. <words>435</words>
I became king by losing proof, philosopher by trusting the glow, and homeless because no single room could hold the map I had become. <words>459</words>
When Lio returned, I thanked him for the betrayal that reassembled me, and we walked until the lanterns circled us like patient brides. <words>482</words>
We read the air together, during readings only we could hear, and the maze finally solved its people. <words>500</words>
