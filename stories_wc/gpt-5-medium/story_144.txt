I met them during a chance encounter at a street fair, while steam rose from my soup pots like cautious banners of truce. <words>23</words>
As a chef feeding interdimensional travelers who tumbled between tents like migrating sparks, I recognized hunger that was bigger than stomachs. <words>44</words>
They asked for directions, but the map in their hands pointed only toward the haunted amusement park log flume beyond the river. <words>66</words>
I closed my stall and followed, compelled by a calling to cook where fear soaked wood and shadows queued like patient diners. <words>88</words>
The log flume creaked through the fog in a calm frenzy, every splash a whisper insisting that the night could be waded. <words>110</words>
An out-of-tune music box floated beside a pier, audibly muted, its ballerina circling without a sound that the ear could claim. <words>131</words>
I felt we had stepped across the hush of long-forgotten lullabies, into the space where recipes and ruins teach each other patience. <words>153</words>
Two factions of travelers waited on opposite docks, their colors incompatible, their histories knotted like nets that had strangled their own fish. <words>175</words>
They had not come for directions; they had come to defy a curse and to unite warring factions before the ride soaked them in loss. <words>200</words>
I told them I was their cook, that I fed bodies and treaties, seasoning bitterness until it softened like onions meeting patient flame. <words>223</words>
In a boat painted with peeled moons, I simmered galaxies of broth, anchoring star-anise, comets of carrot, and thyme clipped from weatherless doors. <words>246</words>
The out-of-tune music box became our metronome, its silence counting beats our feuding tongues could not, a conductor of pauses and smells. <words>268</words>
I ladled stew into the bobbing hull, and the boat rocked like the cradle of hope, cradling spoons instead of infants, tremors easing. <words>291</words>
The curse said the log flume remembered a war no one else did, a quarrel between founders whose children wrote lullabies instead of apologies. <words>315</words>
To defy their inheritance, I offered a calm frenzy of courses, small dishes passed hand to hand while the queue of boats applauded. <words>338</words>
The ghosts emerged, audibly muted as if underwater, tasting by memory, and the factions watched their elders finish the steam and bow to each other. <words>363</words>
I seasoned the finale with borders ground to salt, peppered with stories, then poured shared broth, and the two docks drifted closer on purpose. <words>387</words>
The music box finally clicked and played a crooked bar, and someone said my voice was a bridge that tasted like cinnamon rain. <words>410</words>
All night, the log flume ferried bowls and promises, the cradle of hope afloat, carrying us across the hush of long-forgotten lullabies toward morning. <words>434</words>
