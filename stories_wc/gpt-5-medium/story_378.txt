The carnival was packing up under the first rays of dawn when I, an accidental mayor, admitted I was scared of miracles. <words>22</words>
My town ended where the highway sagged into a polluted swamp orchard tended by reclusive monks who grew pears by prayer. <words>43</words>
Everyone called me lovably grumpy because I vetoed balloons but bought breakfast for anyone who returned a library book on time. <words>64</words>
As vendors folded their tents, a crowded cafe steamed beside the midway, and I slipped in to hide from decisions. <words>84</words>
I overheard a conversation that hummed like wires, two monks discussing water wisdom and the hour our orchard would stop breathing. <words>105</words>
They spoke of a clockwork beetle buried in the silt, a teacher that would metamorphose when awakened by a reluctant heart. <words>126</words>
I finished my coffee, snapped at the barista about change, then apologized, because I needed change more than he did. <words>146</words>
The monks left, and their words clung like swamp gnats, steering me toward the orchard where pears floated in oily puddles. <words>167</words>
I had become mayor by accident after a raffle, a clerical prank that stuck when the previous candidate ran away with the carousel. <words>190</words>
Now fate was folding its tents too, and I wanted to change the course of fate before it rolled downriver forever. <words>211</words>
At the orchard fence, a monk in waders regarded me with reluctant awe, as if every grumble were a prayer in overalls. <words>233</words>
He handed me a spade and a windup key, saying the beetle waits for someone who dislikes power yet carries it anyway. <words>255</words>
We dug in the sour mud until my shoes sighed, and the clockwork beetle surfaced with a cough of bubbles like pennies. <words>277</words>
Its shell was a tarnished map, segments etched with irrigation lines, cisterns, and prayers shaped like small canals through the ribs. <words>298</words>
When I turned the key, the beetle woke and seemed to listen, then its wings unfolded and metamorphosed into a ladle of light. <words>321</words>
The monk whispered water wisdom, not a spell but a practice, a rhythm of giving the land sips instead of floods of regret. <words>344</words>
We carried the ladle between rows of blistered trees, pouring measured arcs that cooled roots and coaxed moths to settle like paper boats. <words>367</words>
Each pour turned the oil slick into mirrors, and in them I saw the city as it might be, soft, drinkable, forgiving. <words>389</words>
The beetle clicked, counting heartbeats, and the carnival trucks groaned past the levee, their taillights like embers carried into a future I could redirect. <words>413</words>
I felt my grumpiness loosening like a knot in wet rope, not gone, just useful, a weight to hold the new rhythm steady. <words>436</words>
Back at city hall, I drafted a plan with the monks to filter runoff through pear roots and reed beds, humbler than heroism. <words>459</words>
If fate was a river, then water wisdom would be its oar, and I, an accidental mayor, would row with reluctant awe. <words>481</words>
