I arrived at the tree ring reading room when ancient echoes converge on today, a frenetic illusionist hiding behind a grin and a battered metal lunchbox. <words>26</words>
They hired me to entertain donors, yet I was here to thread a labyrinth with your own story, which is to say with mine. <words>50</words>
The room had concentric tables of oak, formally imperfect, each scarred slab displaying thin brown rings like calendars that never learned surrender. <words>72</words>
A zephyr slipped through the cracked transom, stirring sawdust, and my cards fluttered like restless moths escaping a hand that could not stop shaking. <words>96</words>
Radiant shifts, I whispered, because light in this chamber always changed color as if the trees were still deciding what to remember. <words>118</words>
Outside, a power outage forces people out of their homes, sparking a connection that would soon pour like footsteps into the museum basement. <words>141</words>
We felt it first as a hush, then a cluster of voices, then bodies warming the air the generators could not steady. <words>163</words>
My set was supposed to be brief, polite, and forgettable, but defiance is my best illusion, and secrets demand audiences. <words>183</words>
I stood on a stool and clicked open the battered metal lunchbox, revealing not lunch, but rings mirrored in tin, a portable grove. <words>206</words>
I asked the newcomers for a story they would not confess aloud, something built from knots and droughts, something only a tree could count. <words>230</words>
Hands rose hesitantly, then bravely, and I shuffled their secrets into the deck, each confession a growth ring that changed the trick. <words>252</words>
Form met fracture; the show became formally imperfect, a ritual of mistakes placed exactly where the wood had endured lightning. <words>272</words>
I dealt, cut, palmed, and lost, then let the cards return, not to my hands, but into the rings, where faces flickered like sap. <words>296</words>
The lights upstairs failed again, and a child cried, and the crowd pressed closer, and the past breathed warm as bark on my cheek. <words>320</words>
Secretive defiance caught in my throat, because I had promised myself never to perform this piece, not since the night I vanished my brother. <words>344</words>
He still writes from nowhere, postcards of blank bark, daring me to try again, daring me to fail better, daring me to call him back. <words>369</words>
So I let the lunchbox resonate, a bell without sound, and invited the room to breathe as one, to exhale their names into the rings. <words>394</words>
As breath condensed, the tin grove answered in radiant shifts, and pathways unfolded like labyrinth threads, not to trap us, but to bind us gently. <words>419</words>
Together we stepped through the rings, one by one, finding my brother waiting where today touches yesterday, and he nodded, formally imperfect, and finally here. <words>444</words>
