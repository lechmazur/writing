I sculpt sugar into saints and knives beneath the tarps of the forgotten market, and every curve sharpens my vendetta. <words>20</words>
Throughout the rebellion, my booth smells like burnt caramel and threat, a beacon for rebels, informants, and ghosts who barter rumors. <words>41</words>
I am precisely creative, a patience honed by flames, measuring heat the way others measure guilt and distance. <words>59</words>
They call me a candy sculptor with a vendetta, but my hands only mirror a heart set on counterattack. <words>78</words>
Against whom, you ask; against the cartographers who hid the sea's second skin and taxed us for staring toward it. <words>98</words>
My motivation is not revenge alone, but to discover a hidden continent whispered through sugar smoke and lullabies. <words>116</words>
The map, they say, was locked in a forgotten locket pried from a throat the night the docks burned. <words>135</words>
I found the locket beneath a fallen stall, its hinge cold as conscience, its face scratched with initials I refuse to speak. <words>157</words>
It would not open, yet anonymous kindness gathered around me like vapor, leaving tools, matches, and notes without signatures. <words>176</words>
Each note carried a photograph, and soon a trail of photographs leading to a forgotten memory stitched the alleys together. <words>196</words>
In every image, my sculptures appeared in miniature, shadows indicating directions, as if my own art were guiding me home. <words>216</words>
Ardent scorn kept me moving, because kindness felt like a trap, and I have always distrusted mercy wrapped in ribbon. <words>236</words>
The trail ended at the shuttered office of the Surveyor General, where rebels had scrawled thirst prayers and prices for maps. <words>257</words>
Inside, I staged my counterattack with sugar, pouring molten amber into locks, casting imprint keys from candy that cooled like resolve. <words>278</words>
The locket finally yielded under the heat, revealing a film negative folded so tight it remembered the curve of a throat. <words>299</words>
Developed in a basin of melted snow and sugar alcohol, the negative bloomed into coastlines arcing like seams on a pearl. <words>320</words>
Anonymous kindness had left the chemicals, the enlarger lens, and a final photograph of a child wearing my own crooked smile. <words>341</words>
The forgotten memory arrived all at once: my mother teaching me to temper sugar, then vanishing the night the docks burned. <words>362</words>
She had been the surveyor's best mind, precisely creative, hiding the continent from tyrants until the rebellion could safeguard it. <words>382</words>
Her locket was her promise; mine would be the voyage, and the market would awaken to sweetness funded by a cartographic counterreign. <words>404</words>
Throughout the rebellion I will trade sugared saints for sails, gather crew from the alleys, and sail on mercy's bitter edge. <words>425</words>
If anonymous kindness is the wind, my scorn is the keel, and together they will deliver us to the hidden continent. <words>446</words>
