At the floating rock monastery, the breakroom went silent after Brother Lio resigned, and the kettles clicked like distant hearts. <words>20</words>
I sat with my sword across my knees, a tired swordsman who pretended to nap so grief would not ask questions. <words>41</words>
They called me fiercely apathetic, which felt accurate and not, like a locked door that still remembers what rain smells like. <words>62</words>
Lio's apron hung crooked on its hook, a small resignation speech made from cotton, sleeves empty of the work they had learned. <words>84</words>
I felt a spark of defiance prick my ribs, an ember that refused to sleep even as my eyelids sagged with years. <words>106</words>
In my plain cloth bag, the map of meteors rasped like a dry leaf, edges starred by oils from careful, unbelieving fingers. <words>128</words>
I had copied the sky for months, marking where the showers braided their silver, like river paths for those who dislike roads. <words>150</words>
It was naive to think falling stones could teach me to overcome what swords never managed, but I kept that naivety knowing. <words>172</words>
Knowing that a promise to oneself survives best when fed crumbs of impossible tasks, I sealed the bag and went to find sky. <words>195</words>
The monastery floated because the world below would not hold it, or so the elders joked, their gravity disguised as tea stains. <words>217</words>
I believed them and did not, which is the honest shape of faith when your wrists remember every hilt they also feared. <words>239</words>
Outside the breakroom window, dusk tumbled, and the first meteors began their patient stitching, teaching the torn sky where to hold. <words>260</words>
Following meteor showers had been my teacher since I drifted here, after failing to protect a village that trusted my quiet blade. <words>282</words>
The hidden promise was this: to learn how to fall without breaking, then rise without clanging, and lay the sword down gently. <words>304</words>
Lio's resignation scratched at me, because he left to grow peppers on a lower terrace, claiming peppers understand patience better than prayers. <words>326</words>
Perhaps he had overcome what I still feared, or perhaps he fled, but either way he reminded me that choice keeps breathing. <words>348</words>
So I moved, not heroically, just steadily, carrying the plain cloth bag as though it could anchor me to something softer than duty. <words>371</words>
I climbed past prayer wheels and sleepy goats, to the wind yard where the meteors could be followed along their braided coordinates. <words>393</words>
Night unscrolled, and I traced the dotted burns, matching them to my map until the map became smaller than my breathing. <words>414</words>
Then I followed the showers, not with feet but with attention, and the spark of defiance expanded, lighting corridors my apathy guarded. <words>436</words>
In that glow I saw how to be fiercely apathetic toward despair itself, shrugging at its drama while cradling what tenderness remained. <words>458</words>
By morning, the sword was still on my knees, but the weight had shifted, and I knew the promise would keep me honest. <words>481</words>
