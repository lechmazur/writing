<story>
Because an accidental double-booking of a vacation rental stranded us in the city overnight, we accepted a cot inside the cybernetic organism manufacturing plant. <words>24</words>
The night foreman seemed normally unusual, offering tea that tasted of solder and lavender while sensors blinked like patient stars. <words>44</words>
With me was Mara, a cryptic medium who hears history in machine hum, and she carried a battered mariner's telescope. <words>64</words>
She said the telescope let her analyze distances of memory, pulling the far past close enough to fog our breath. <words>84</words>
We had come not for tourism, but to collect creation myths whispered by newly assembled minds flickering toward their first sight. <words>105</words>
The plant hosted an artist painting guidance icons on the walls, and throughout painting, Mara listened like a lighthouse listening to fog. <words>127</words>
Each stroke unrolled a corridor of color where conveyor belts sang, and the foreman asked us to record anything the machines might confess. <words>150</words>
Mara raised the mariner's telescope to the long line of hatchlings, peering not at distance, but at the small horizons of their eyes. <words>173</words>
I watched her mouth shape syllables like antennae, then write them in pencil on shipping paper, a written legacy forming between pallets. <words>195</words>
She told me the myths arrive as error-correcting lullabies: who soldered the first spark, who measured the first shiver of self. <words>216</words>
To thank us, the foreman let us sleep beside the assembly bay, where blue scaffolds breathed like patient whales, an unease that felt parental. <words>240</words>
In the dim, I analyze the mural the artist is slowly finishing, a compass of icons that mirrors the telescope's secret cardinal points. <words>263</words>
Mara whispers that myths prefer tools because tools remember touch, and our job is to make the touch legible without taming it. <words>285</words>
She asks the hatchlings their earliest questions, and I record: Where does warmth come from, and why do names weigh differently than numbers. <words>308</words>
Her answers arrive threaded through the telescope, which she sets like a listening glass against casings, lifting murmurs you feel more than hear. <words>331</words>
The artist paints these lines into the corridors, so that workers will carry them home on fingernails, a portable chapel of sentences. <words>353</words>
By morning, the plant resembles a tide pool of light, and our written legacy clings to it like salt, crystalline and stubborn. <words>375</words>
The foreman signs our notes with an oily thumbprint, promising that your normally unusual visit will be archived beside service manuals. <words>396</words>
Mara smiles, tired, saying the point of myths is not to tame the unknown, but to make our fear sit down and breathe. <words>419</words>
When we leave, the telescope hangs from her wrist like a moon, and throughout painting the walls keep listening after us. <words>440</words>
