<story>In the quiet tower at dawn, the air holds a meteor hush that feels stitched by long needles of light. [20]
I wake after the anesthesia wears off, fingers numb, memory raw, the ivy on the sill already pulling at my attention. [41]
I am a closure seeker who opens wounds, and I hate the truth of how often I am right. [60]
The ivy answers my unasked ache because I am accidentally telepathic with plants, a gift arrived like a misaddressed letter. [80]
They whisper of roots that braid time, of saplings that learn our names from soil scars and spilled coffee. [99]
On my desk, by examining coffee rings, I track shivers of yesterday, the way cups trembled when the news reached us. [120]
Each halo stains a little chronicle, a tide line for grief tides, and I read them to learn to read the stories in scars. [144]
The frosted hourglass on the window ledge clouds the sunrise, its sand whispering down like distant rain I cannot reach. [164]
She left it, Mira, on the morning the tunnel collapsed, when the earth took a breath and forgot to exhale her. [185]
The plants told me then that a displaced miracle slipped, saving the wrong lungs, landing warm and frantic inside mine. [205]
I did not ask for it, but my heartbeat learned leaf rhythms, and the ivy began to translate the silence of debris. [227]
Since then I walk a corridor between green voices and human hurt, and every question I ask opens cauterized rooms. [247]
I make appointments, pour coffee, watch the hands that shake, and scry the tremors in the rings for fault lines of memory. [269]
People want closure, they say, and I want it too, but I am a blade disguised as a salve. [288]
Last night I let a surgeon thread my palms, a ritual of numbness, so the maps of my own scars could stop shouting. [311]
Now, after the anesthesia wears off, pins of sensation return, and each pin is a star in an impossible sky. [331]
The meteor hush holds, the city below whispering that it too survived by miscalculation, and expects me to explain the math. [352]
I lift the frosted hourglass and press it to the sill until the cold bleeds into my wrists, steadying the tremor into purpose. [375]
The ivy asks, shall we go, and I answer yes, because the roots have been drafting letters for months I refused to mail. [398]
We descend the stairs, cross the waking streets, and find the fenced scar of the works where the tunnel yawns like a held breath. [422]
Inside, I do not light a lamp; I let the plants tunnel with me, their whispers braiding into a rope I can grip. [445]
Moss guides my feet to a chamber where the ceiling failed, and ferns hold vigil like green candles around the dark. [466]
There, half buried, waits the outline of a cup in clay, a phantom circle, a coffee ring hardened into fossilized morning. [487]
I kneel, set the hourglass beside it, and the sand hush deepens, as if time agrees to hold still while I listen. [509]
By examining coffee rings, even fossil ones, I can read how her hand steadied someone else, how her last gesture was reassurance, not fear. [533]
The plants murmur the same story: the miracle leapt early, mistook my body for hers, and left her courage to shelter the others. [556]
That is why the displaced miracle feels like a wind under my ribs, and why I cannot breathe without tasting loam and apology. [579]
I have opened this wound in myself and everyone around me, but the hourglass is a throat, and I know what to say. [602]
I crack the frosted hourglass against a stone, pour its cold sand into the ring, and plant the ivy cutting in the center. [625]
Take back what you can, I whisper, and if not, carry her steadiness forward, teach me to read it in living scars. [647]
The ivy drinks, the ferns bow, and a hush like the pause before meteors gathers, then breaks into a gentle breath through the chamber. [671]
When I carry the emptied glass back to the quiet tower at dawn, I know closure is not a gate but a garden I will learn, slowly, without opening more wounds than I heal. [705]</story>
