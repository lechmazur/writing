At the bell's echo marking a forgotten recess, I jog back into the quantum tunnel like a medic late for homeroom. <words>21</words>
I am the time-looping paramedic, clocking in where minutes commute in circles and casualties collide with their earlier versions. <words>40</words>
My shift pays in excited boredom, a jittery patience that knows when screams arrive and where bandages will already smell like rain. <words>62</words>
Today I track a child only I remember, a quiet boy who guides me by the sound of a single raindrop. <words>83</words>
He went missing inside the tunnel days ago, or maybe tomorrow, and the patrols keep resetting before their notes can argue with causality. <words>106</words>
I carry a weathered fishing lure from his grandfather, its paint chipped to confession, a small comet snagging my pocket like a reminder. <words>129</words>
The boy believed the lure could nest light, coaxing glints of home from the dark whenever the tunnel pretended to be an ocean. <words>152</words>
In a city privately public about its disasters, we practice our calm for cameras while our breaths still spell unhealed traumas on the cold. <words>176</words>
The tunnel amplifies memory, turning every siren into an argument between what happened and what refused to finish happening. <words>195</words>
I triangulate the boy's location by drops and echoes, counting heartbeats like subway stops, promising myself a better conclusion without believing it. <words>217</words>
When the bell tolls again faintly, the loop snaps shut like a medic bag, and I find him standing inside a page of dust motes. <words>242</words>
He is watching the lure glow with washed out courage, and he says the raindrop told him to wait where recess never ended. <words>265</words>
At the bell's echo marking a forgotten recess, I kneel and tell him we are late to forgiveness, yet right on time for it. <words>289</words>
It is not a rescue, I say, it is a ritual, to baptize your nightmares in acceptance and let them drip back into the earth. <words>314</words>
I show him how medics nest panic inside tasks, how we fold the shaking into tape, gauze, and voices that refuse to accelerate. <words>337</words>
I clip the lure to his sleeve and ask for the rain, and together we listen until the single drop becomes a map. <words>360</words>
It points us toward an exit newly old, where time folds like linens, and we step through carrying the quiet as if it were bandage. <words>385</words>
Outside, the city pretends not to see, privately public as ever, but the boy and I agree that pretense is just practice for courage. <words>409</words>
My history still loops inside the sirens, my unhealed traumas crowding like passengers, yet their faces look rinsed, as if passing has finally meant passage. <words>434</words>
When the bell echoes again, I clock back into the tunnel with a steadier impatience, hunting the next emergency like a long awaited recess. <words>458</words>
