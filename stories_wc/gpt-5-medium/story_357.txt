I am a focused collector, cataloging silences and small signs with methods that are disciplined, deliberate, and seldom odd. <words>19</words>
I keep a battered journal with a black rose pinned in its spine, a thorny bookmark for my breathing. <words>38</words>
Yesterday a sudden invitation to a party arrived like a snowball, directing me to a frost giant's lair. <words>56</words>
I went to triumph over an alpha predator called despair, which I had tracked to that address. <words>73</words>
Besides, even monsters throw parties, and I figured RSVP stood for Restrain Sadness, Victory Pending. <words>88</words>
The lair opened like a cold theater, balconies of icicles overlooking a table carved with constellations of hexes. <words>106</words>
The frost giant greeted me with mugs of vapor and a board game whose rounds would chart the hours of my visit. <words>128</words>
That was the party, two competitors and a chorus of quiet, which suited me, because embracing solitude is my rallying cheer. <words>149</words>
The rules were ornate but honest, and I began to unravel their purpose as carefully as I catalog relics. <words>168</words>
Despair hunted between turns, invisible yet heavy, pacing the rafters like a white bear that had swallowed midnight. <words>186</words>
I placed my journal beside the board, and the black rose pinned in a journal perfumed the air with stern rehearsals of survival. <words>209</words>
The giant mocked my rituals, yet my lines and lists are seldom odd; their symmetry trains patience like a bowstring. <words>229</words>
I told him I collect endings the way others collect stamps, though mine stick best when sealed with cheeky resolve. <words>249</words>
Throughout board game rounds, I played openings like winters and endgames like spring, trading ice for breath, silence for sight. <words>269</words>
The sudden invitation had not been bait but clearance, a permit into the archive where my rival kept his fear. <words>289</words>
Midgame, the alpha predator lunged in a gust that rattled pawns, and I let my loneliness catch it like a net. <words>310</words>
I used the rose pin as a stand-in queen, a pledge that every captured square would host a breath instead of a ghost. <words>333</words>
I joked that checkmate was simply self-care with better marketing, and the giant laughed, cracking frost from his beard. <words>352</words>
In the final round, my pattern unraveled despair like a spool of shadow, revealing pale string that wind could carry away. <words>373</words>
The frost giant bowed, awarded me an icicle token, and promised future parties where solitude would still be welcomed company. <words>393</words>
I left his lair with the journal warm beneath my arm, the black rose pinned firm, and my silence newly companionable. <words>414</words>
If another invite finds me, I will accept again, to play through rounds until triumph becomes a habit, not a hunt. <words>435</words>
