In the hush after a coin toss decides fate, the flower pressing workshop felt like a chapel of breathless petals. <words>20</words>
I, a nomadic dreamer with dirt under my nails and sky in my pockets, stood between racks of frames and blotter. <words>41</words>
Above the pruning shears hung an absurd keepsake, a mariner's wheel salvaged from a shipbreaker's yard, its varnish smelling like storms. <words>62</words>
The coin had landed on heads, granting me entry to a secret mission entrusted to a select group of gardeners who spoke in whispers. <words>86</words>
Our oath required masked intentions, kindness veiled as brusque commerce, purpose hidden beneath the rustle of ferns and paper. <words>105</words>
We were ferociously polite, bowing to beetles, thanking mildew, apologizing to stems we cut and courting the moon with compost. <words>125</words>
The mission was to achieve harmony with nature, not by conquest, but by mending the torn letters between soil and seed. <words>146</words>
The mariner's wheel, bolted above the workbench, turned each time we pressed a blossom, as if charting a route across a silent sea of sap. <words>171</words>
I felt anguished joy when petals surrendered their color to paper, an ache like sunrise trapped under glass. <words>189</words>
A supplier arrived with crates and questions, his grin stitched with masked intentions that glimmered like fish beneath oil. <words>208</words>
We served him tea in chipped cups and were ferociously polite, but our hands hovered near the bindery clamps like wary gulls. <words>230</words>
The hush after the coin toss still trembled in the rafters, a verdict demanding we intervene when balance tilted. <words>249</words>
As he pried at a ledger, the wheel creaked and pointed north, our signal that the tide of intent had turned hostile. <words>271</words>
I intervened by offering him the ugliest bouquet we owned, a clutch of bristling thistles wrapped in newsprint and ash. <words>291</words>
While he blinked, I bowed, ferociously polite, and apologized for the prickles that would remind his hands to ask permission before taking. <words>313</words>
He laughed, but the laugh was a knife disguised as ribbon, and the ledger slid toward his jacket like a frightened mouse. <words>335</words>
From the rafters, my friends descended on ropes we used to dry herbs, a select group whose fingertips could turn pages into feathers. <words>358</words>
We did not bind him; we bound the air, pressing a wreath around his shoulders that hummed until his heartbeat slowed to the moss's tempo. <words>383</words>
He confessed that he had come to buy the workshop for a landfill company, but his daughter collected wildflowers and he could not resist their pleading. <words>409</words>
Masked intentions met ours, and I spun the mariner's wheel to a bearing where he might see profit in protection, margin in mercy. <words>432</words>
Anguished joy welled when he nodded, because saving a field by bartering with greed felt like singing with a cracked reed. <words>453</words>
In that hush, after the coin toss and our careful violence of care, we charted peace, pressed it flat, and let it breathe. <words>476</words>
