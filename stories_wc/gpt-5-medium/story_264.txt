Between innings, the shooting star tracking station grew as hushed as a chapel waiting for a bell that never rings. <words>20</words>
That was when the unruly alchemist I supervised chose to make announcements, hair misbehaving like comet tails. <words>37</words>
I approached with infinite caution, clipboard tucked to my ribs as if it were a fragile shield. <words>54</words>
He turned with a hauntingly cheerful grin that unsettled even the telescopes, which squeaked on their mounts like old knees. <words>74</words>
Behind him, the outdated overhead projector throbbed to life, its hum a domesticated thunder he insisted could impress any skeptic. <words>94</words>
He set a magnifying glass with a cracked lens on the glass bed, where it looked like a wounded portal. <words>114</words>
He whispered, Then let us touch the touched sky without burning our hands. <words>127</words>
His aim, he kept reminding me, was to disarm cynicism with playful wonder before the crowds returned to their seats. <words>147</words>
He rotated the cracked lens until the hum synchronized with a lattice of shadows that drifted up the wall like constellations learning to walk. <words>171</words>
Outside, the scoreboard paused at zeros while the umpire dusted home plate, and we borrowed that breathing space between innings for our experiment. <words>194</words>
From the catwalk above the domes, distant fans sounded like surf breaking on aluminum shores. <words>209</words>
He asked me to hold still as he positioned the glass, each movement rehearsed with infinite caution despite the gleam in his eyes. <words>232</words>
The projector threw a warped circle across the ceiling, and within it the crack multiplied stars into trembling branches. <words>251</words>
You see, he said, the sky only seems distant because we refuse the nearness that flaws reveal. <words>268</words>
He invited the interns, and even the janitor with his sunflower broom, to stand beneath the circle and hold up their hands. <words>290</words>
Shadows bloomed like gloves meeting fly balls, and for a breath everyone swore they felt the touched sky pressing back. <words>310</words>
Even I, promoter of rules and lockboxes, felt my cynicism loosen like a knot soaking in tidewater. <words>327</words>
The alchemist bowed with a flourish that sent dust into constellations, his unruly hair crackling with static and mischief. <words>346</words>
He said he would log the observation as a minor meteor of morale, achieved via the hum of an outdated overhead projector. <words>368</words>
I endorsed the note, adding that the magnifying glass with the cracked lens should be stored in velvet, as if it were a living relic. <words>393</words>
The crowd roared outside, innings resumed, yet our station kept its hush like a secret stitched under skin. <words>411</words>
He cleaned the glass and, hauntingly cheerful, promised to behave until the next pause in the world invited play. <words>430</words>
