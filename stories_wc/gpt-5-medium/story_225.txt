<story>Between broken treaties, I signed on as the wayward apothecary of the battered marvel that is the Seahare. <words>18</words>
Her steampunk submarine observation deck was all brass ribs and cathedral glass, groaning like a whale that remembered clockwork hymns. <words>38</words>
I came to track migratory butterflies the diplomats refused to see, luminous drifters that crossed oceans following heat scars and secrets. <words>59</words>
They skimmed the waves at dusk, portfolios of living maps, and I believed their paths might redraw a world that treaties had bruised. <words>82</words>
My methods were herbs and hearsay, tinctures brewed from kelp ash, and a dry highlighter pen that left pressure grooves on fogged panes. <words>105</words>
Each morning I traced butterfly wakes with that barren nib across the glass, etching constellations the helmsman swore were better than charts. <words>127</words>
Below us, boilers clanked like hearts practicing, and above, the sky sent rumors down dangling as radiograms. <words>144</words>
On second watch, I conversed with Wren, the sonarist whose sense of justice was unjustly fair, too balanced to survive our era. <words>166</words>
Their hands spoke through Morse code signals tapped along the copper rail, terse constellations that warmed my wrists more surely than steam. <words>188</words>
Our words never met ink, only impacts, as if modesty were a hull and love were a lantern swinging inside the rivets. <words>210</words>
It was unconventional love, rigorously distilled, and it asked no titles from a world killing its grammar one guarantee at a time. <words>232</words>
When the butterflies diverged over a trench like two schools of doubt, Wren drummed a question across the rail about choosing a swarm. <words>255</words>
I tapped back that medicine could follow motives, that I meant to infect despair with inference, and follow the brighter hunger. <words>276</words>
Wren replied a single word, Stay, stretched into pulses, and the deck lights flickered as if electricity wanted to applaud restraint. <words>297</words>
We stayed on the Seahare, prowling the fog where diplomats hid their wrecked signatures, and the butterflies began using us as weather. <words>319</words>
They lit on the observation deck at night, dusting goggles with powder that made rust hesitate, while boilers held their breath. <words>340</words>
I mixed a draught from their moulted scales, salt sweetness that did nothing for wounds yet clarified intent like lightning clarifies clouds. <words>362</words>
Sipped discreetly, it made the crew quit making enemies of echoes, and we plotted routes by kindness measured in flutter spans. <words>383</words>
The Admiralty sent orders that balanced cruelty with courtesy, unjustly fair again, demanding surrender with please, and we pretended static. <words>403</words>
Wren tapped a fugue of refusal, and I traced butterflies into the mist with my dry highlighter pen until their paths looked permanent. <words>426</words>
At dawn we rose under a sky looped with migrants, and I knew our work and our togetherness were the same science. <words>448</words>
Between broken treaties, we became a moving sanctuary where love wrote remedy through Morse code signals, and butterflies corrected the map. <words>469</words></story>
