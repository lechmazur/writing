<story>
The homemade raft sighs as it breaks free of the reeds and touches open water, and that bright hush becomes my hourglass, turning the present into a trembling mirror. <words>29</words>
I am the off-grid survivalist baron of the catacomb orchard, whose tree roots snake between bones like cursive, writing centuries nobody will read. <words>52</words>
I push away from shore not to escape but to archive seasonal changes, a ledger of winds and leaf-galls etched on skin, waterlines, and the patient dust of skulls. <words>81</words>
In my kit rides an empty bottle, clear as guilt, waiting to be filled with whatever the river shows me by reflecting the unknown without claiming it. <words>108</words>
The noon sun scatters scales on the waves, a luminous doubt that makes every distant landmark visibly obscure, beautiful and inadequate, as if truth needed fog to protect its edges. <words>138</words>
On the bank, my sister keeps pace, hands flickering by the silent communication of sign language, reminding me to inventory buds, husks, and the taste of metal rain. <words>166</words>
We promised to unearth the seasons from their crypts, she from the shore, I from the channel, meeting halfway in notes corked and set adrift. <words>191</words>
Behind her, the orchard burrows into catacombs, branches looped with tags I carved from driftwood, where roots snake between bones and find water older than our names. <words>218</words>
My title is a joke that grew serious: baron not of land but of refuse and shelter, of caches stitched into cliffs, of maps memorized because paper burns. <words>246</words>
I trust the river because it never pretends to know me, only keeps reflecting the unknown, a face rearranged by ripples, a crown of gnats, a future without furniture. <words>275</words>
When the raft noses past the last cane, I lower the empty bottle until it almost kisses the skin of the water, then stop, listening for signs I cannot hear. <words>305</words>
Across the glitter, my sister signs a story about frost that bloomed like lace on skullcaps in winter, and I answer with slow, clumsy hands that ache for soil. <words>334</words>
We cannot trust calendars anymore; they arrive visibly obscure, shipped from elsewhere, while our orchard keeps time in sap pressure and in the luminous doubt of migrating moths. <words>362</words>
So in the moment a homemade raft touches open water, I decide the archive needs not just dates but whispers, the way silence bruises when handled carefully. <words>389</words>
I breathe into the bottle and it fogs, a cloud I cannot catalog, then I write three signs in charcoal on a strip of bark and feed them inside. <words>418</words>
When I set it afloat, she salutes, and we let the current unearth a path for our message, trusting the river to carry our visibly obscure proofs toward someone else's luminous doubt. <words>450</words>
