The cranky oracle cleared her throat in the secret society chamber, where candles bruised the stone with shivering halos. <words>19</words>
Outside, the city blushed under a fleeting golden sunset, promising revelations that tasted like metal and lies. <words>36</words>
I had come to chronicle ancient patterns, yet patterns seldom confess unless coaxed by the art of deception. <words>54</words>
So I spoke with candid deceit, promising the circle that truth would arrive wearing a friendly, borrowed mask. <words>72</words>
On the altar waited an abandoned terrarium, latticed with dust, its glass bell jar sheltering a wilted forest of secrets. <words>92</words>
The oracle snarled that what thrived inside was virtually rare, a species of memory that germinates only in exiled minds. <words>112</words>
She claimed the fragments had resettled themselves, as refugees from forgotten wars between intention and accident. <words>128</words>
I asked how we were meant to read that bruised greenhouse, and she crooked a nicotine constellated finger. <words>146</words>
Through the glimmer of battered dog tags in a pawn shop, she said, because metal remembers what flesh denies. <words>165</words>
I fetched the tags from my coat, souvenirs from errant soldiers who once traded rank for breath and oblivion. <words>184</words>
When their edges kissed the terrarium glass, the soil quivered, and a microcosm brightened like embered honey. <words>201</words>
Patterns rose as transparent insects, arranging themselves into alphabets that crawled across the lid, stinging comprehension into us. <words>219</words>
The oracle groaned because prophecy tastes like old coins, and still she ordered me to resettle the fragile colony. <words>238</words>
I shifted moss, nudged invisible bones, and planted the tags as landmarks, so future doubts could return home. <words>256</words>
Each movement confessed a theft, because arranging memories is stealing from time, and the art of deception requires tribute. <words>275</words>
I lied for the record, and I told the record I was lying, that both versions might bracket the truth. <words>295</words>
Our chamber smelled like rain soaked libraries, while outside the sky thinned, the fleeting sun threading gold through ruined eaves. <words>315</words>
The circle murmured oaths that meant their opposite, practicing candid deceit because honesty often fails the test of endurance. <words>334</words>
I realized our purpose was not revelation but cartography, to chronicle ancient patterns so others might navigate uncertainty. <words>352</words>
The oracle softened, almost, murmuring that maps are contracts between what exists and what pretends, and both deserve signatures. <words>371</words>
So I promised to keep the terrarium, to tend its practically extinct gloss, a virtually rare compass of remembering. <words>390</words>
When the sun finally smoldered out, we sealed the glass, resettled around the table, and signed with borrowed names. <words>409</words>
In the silence, the dog tags clicked like distant hoofbeats, counting time for exiles who still wanted to return. <words>428</words>
If they arrive, I will greet them with hospitality and misdirection, because kindly confusion protects what deserves survival. <words>446</words>
I will teach them which lies are honest, which truths are murderous, and who must be deceived to wake up whole. <words>467</words>
Then the oracle, suddenly pleased, blessed the maps and the moss, and the night accepted our careful duplicities. <words>485</words>
