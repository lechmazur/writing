<story>Soon after check-in at the black hole resort, I borrowed a humming rental bike to pace my nerves. <words>18</words>
The corridor stars twitched like ash, and the concierge offered savage bliss in a flute of microgravity tea. <words>36</words>
I was their mild-tempered guard, assigned to monitor joy without arresting it. <words>48</words>
My brief demanded calm eyes and poetically bland reports that could survive censors and cosmic shear. <words>64</words>
Yet my shadow kept snagging on the unraveling thread only I could feel tugging at consequence. <words>80</words>
Guests drifted like pollen around the event horizon pool, trading masks and destinies as casually as towels. <words>97</words>
My assignment said observe, but my motive gnawed different: to refuse the false dichotomy of hero or villain. <words>115</words>
Labels fell into the singularity; bodies stayed, wanting music, wanting forgiveness, wanting a discreet escort to the brink. <words>133</words>
I learned their trajectories amid bike rides around the perimeter, counting orbits like beads of a stubborn rosary. <words>151</words>
Sometimes I practiced disguise, the uniform unbadged, the smile misaligned, the posture carefully undecided. <words>165</words>
I distinguished nothing from everything by following stray cats through alleyways between suites carved from collapsed light. <words>182</words>
The cats owned shortcuts through service vents and memory, where housekeeping stacked lost hours like linens. <words>198</words>
There, an antique blacksmith's anvil anchored the maintenance bay, absurdly heavy in a place that ate weight. <words>215</words>
The foreman said it kept the building remembering solidity whenever the horizon hiccuped and wanted to inhale us. <words>233</words>
I touched the iron and felt the universe pausing like a brawler deciding whether to hug or swing. <words>251</words>
It felt like my soul's assignment, neither arrest nor indulgence, just firm gravity for anyone about to slip. <words>269</words>
So I became custodian of the anvil, the cats my watch partners, the guests my restless galaxy. <words>286</words>
When storms of radiation sang, I read poetically bland bulletins into the intercom, then rode circuits like a hymn. <words>305</words>
The guests heard compliance and felt permission, and their shoulders settled into savage bliss with unarmed relief. <words>322</words>
One evening a masked magnate tried to buy my certainty, as if morality were a wristband with lounge access. <words>341</words>
I answered with routes, not answers, and led them past the pool to the bay, biking slow as thought. <words>360</words>
We stopped where the anvil greeted gravity like an old dog, and I unpocketed the thread I had saved. <words>379</words>
It had unraveled from a mask, bright as a dare, stubborn as a vow no role could swallow. <words>397</words>
Choose, they said, hero wristband or villain wristband, because the lounge hates gray like mirrors hate blinking. <words>414</words>
I looped the thread around the anvil horn and let the singularity tug, tightening honesty until labels squealed. <words>432</words>
Look, I told them, watch how not-choosing keeps the world from choosing you, and the cats nodded like judges. <words>451</words>
The magnate removed their mask, then another beneath it, until only a face remained that wanted to breathe. <words>469</words>
They walked away lighter, and I filed a report that read like water, then went riding, orbit by orbit. <words>488</words>
The anvil kept time, the resort kept spinning, and I kept guard. <words>500</words></story>
