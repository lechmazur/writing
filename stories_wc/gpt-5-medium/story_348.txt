I am a somnambulist scout, moving in dreams while others sleep, and I travel light, carrying a bottled lightning bug collection that remembers the dark. <words>25</words>
Between flights, I follow small maps the fireflies draw on glass, their pulsing cartography nudging me toward places memory tries to silt over. <words>48</words>
This layover is for a yearly pilgrimage to a family's ancestral home, rumored to sink a little farther each season into bog and rumor. <words>72</words>
Under that house sleeps a sunken laboratory, once my great grandmother's field station, drowned by the swamp when her notebooks learned to breathe water. <words>96</words>
People say the walls there keep woodland secrets, and the roots that pierced the ceilings whisper answers only a sleepwalker can hear. <words>118</words>
I am unapologetically humble about the task, but my purpose is exact: to map spiritual wisdom before the next boarding call tears my trail in half. <words>144</words>
I scout by listening to the fireflies hum, each jar a compass that turns when a buried truth breathes nearby. <words>164</words>
The house greets me with tilted porches, and I step through, past portraits clouded with algae bloom, into the hatch my grandmother sealed with a lullaby. <words>190</words>
In the stairwell, dream and wakefulness braid; nightwater reaches ankle high, and the bottled lightning bug collection turns cathedral bright, painting constellations across the varnished banister. <words>216</words>
Below, the sunken laboratory exhales through a crack like a reed, instruments limned with moss, jars holding seeds that still remember the geometry of sunlight. <words>241</words>
The fireflies crowd one shelf, pulsing over a map drawn on bark, a record of ancestors traveling by moon echoes and sap tides. <words>264</words>
I press the jars against the bark and let their lights align the routes, and the lines shift, revealing detours where grief once flooded the footpaths. <words>290</words>
Loaded curiosity fills the room like fog horns, the feeling of questions weighed with inheritance, and I ask the lab to speak in a language of sleep. <words>317</words>
Pipes reply with patient clinks, and the floor opens a memory: my great grandmother wading here, charting bird silence after logging, promising the marsh to carry our names forward. <words>346</words>
I kneel and copy the bark map into a damp notebook, noting which oaks shelter confessions and which hollows store laughter like rainwater, and the jars dim, satisfied. <words>374</words>
Between flights will end soon, yet I finish the pilgrimage chart, because this is how I say thank you to the forest that tutored our sleepwalking. <words>400</words>
