<story>In the bacteria-powered city, a nervous minstrel tuned his cracked lute while street lamps fizzed with cultured dawn.<words>18</words>
Tonight the grid hummed like a sleeping animal, yet the crowd danced with cautious revelry beside warm fermenting vents.<words>37</words>
He was rarely sincere, hiding fear behind patter, because applause steadied his twitching hands better than faith ever did.<words>56</words>
But tonight his pocket held a crumpled photograph, edges silvered, showing him as a child beneath a handmade constellation kite.<words>76</words>
On its back, in his mother's cramped ink, a promise waited: escaping the ordinary by following star patterns across roofs.<words>96</words>
He set himself a limit, before a lonely candle flame gutters out, to find purpose in a world of uncertainty tonight.<words>117</words>
The bacterium-fed turbines throbbed beneath gratings as he climbed, planning to deploy his only plan: pretend confidence until truth arrived.<words>137</words>
Wind carried sour sweetness from vats, and neon microbes smeared constellations on plexiglass panels like smudged maps of elsewhere.<words>156</words>
He followed those hints, reading their accidental sky, and the photograph crackled with memory every time he checked his course.<words>176</words>
Two maintenance officers challenged him near the bio-reactor scaffolds, demanding purpose; he answered with a song about valves learning to dream.<words>197</words>
Rare laughter opened their faces, that cautious revelry again, and they waved him upward as pressure gauges blinked like harbor lights.<words>218</words>
On the highest catwalk he paused, aligning the photograph against the sky, finding the kite's frame echoed by three patient stars.<words>239</words>
Those stars aimed toward the desalination tower, then farther, toward a forgotten theater whose roof had caved during a blackout.<words>259</words>
He squeezed the lute for courage and descended ladders, cheeks shiny with mist, aware he was finally escaping the ordinary without smiling.<words>281</words>
Inside the theater, bacteria glowed along ripped velvet like dim galaxies, and he realized the city itself had been mapping a path.<words>303</words>
He lifted the photograph to the balcony, matched stains to constellations, and found a hatch where stagehands once hauled dream machines.<words>324</words>
Beneath, a small chamber held a gutted console and an old star disk, inscribed with motherly notes on harmonics for microbes.<words>345</words>
His mother had tended vats here, he realized, composing blueprints for power and joy by following star patterns no auditor valued.<words>366</words>
He tuned the lute to the frequency etched there, then played, not charming, not joking, but earnest, and the walls answered.<words>387</words>
Turbines steadied, alley bulbs brightened, and the crowd outside cheered with cautious revelry, as if uncertainty itself could be conducted.<words>407</words>
The candle in his lantern guttered but lived, and he understood his purpose: tune this bacteria-powered city toward brave harmonies.<words>427</words>
For a nervous minstrel who was rarely sincere, sincerity felt like a strange costume he could finally learn to wear.<words>447</words>
He laughed softly, promised the air to stay, and began charting tours that would deploy joy as a civic instrument.<words>467</words>
Not to escape the city, but to guide its escaping the ordinary, he walked home while the photograph warmed his palm.<words>488</words></story>
