<story>Floodwater whispered across the orchestra pit as a reticent scholar tested lantern wicks that refused steady brightness. <words>17</words>
Above the drowned red seats, cake batter rose in a backstage oven, scenting the air with sugared bravado. <words>35</words>
The baker, a technically mischievous stagehand, insisted celebrations required sweetness even when audiences had learned to drift away. <words>53</words>
The scholar agreed only in silence, nodding toward an ancient clay tablet with runes that waited on a cracked music stand. <words>74</words>
It had arrived months ago via sketches hidden in the binding of a vintage dictionary rescued from a library flood. <words>94</words>
Each sketch mapped the opera house like a riddle, promising a gathering of echoes if one dared to knock just right. <words>115</words>
Complacency had settled here like algae, green and pretty and suffocating, and the scholar longed to dethrone it. <words>133</words>
Lanterns flickered, casting rehearsal shadows, and the flooded aisles mirrored galaxies where discarded programs drifted like reluctant comets. <words>151</words>
With a spoon borrowed from the batter bowl, the scholar tapped the tablet once, a polite and practiced knock. <words>170</words>
Ripples answered in the water, syllables without consonants, the first faint guests of the promised gathering of echoes. <words>188</words>
The stagehand peeked from the door, wiped flour on his trousers, and asked whether the party required frosting or courage. <words>208</words>
Courage, whispered the scholar at last, surprised to hear her own voice ring like a bell hung in seawater. <words>227</words>
She opened the dictionary, revealing the stitched spine where the clandestine sketches continued, arrows pointing toward sunken trapdoors and drowned acoustics. <words>248</words>
Following them meant bending safety rules, which, in technically mischievous fashion, the stagehand interpreted as an invitation to improvise flotation devices from props. <words>271</words>
She stepped onto a painted door balanced like a raft, while he steadied it with broom handles and very optimistic humming. <words>292</words>
The tablet lay on her lap, runes glistening with condensation, as if soaking up the opera to translate it later. <words>312</words>
They punted toward the proscenium, where lanterns shook like nervous fireflies, and beyond the velvet arch the water deepened into rumor. <words>333</words>
Again she knocked, this time with the spoon and the heel of her patient heart, and the echoes gathered themselves into listeners. <words>355</words>
Out of balconies drifted memories of applause, muffled by water yet insistent, as if the hall wished to remember how to be brave. <words>378</words>
The scholar read the runes aloud, discovering they were annotations on etiquette, instructions for when an audience forgets to care. <words>398</words>
They advised knocking politely, then boldly, then with jokes that blush the truth into motion, which felt like pensive mirth made portable. <words>420</words>
So she told the echoes a story of a cake rising despite the flood, and of scholars who refuse to sit dry. <words>442</words>
The oven chimed, the stagehand cheered, and the hall lifted its voice, not in farewell but in rehearsal for tomorrow. <words>462</words>
Together they sliced the cake and fed it to the gathering of echoes, which swallowed sweetness and spit out resolve. <words>482</words></story>
