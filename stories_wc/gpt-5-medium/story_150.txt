I am an outlaw cowboy poet who keeps time with a pocket metronome instead of a gun. <words>17</words>
Tonight I rehearse under a steampunk observatory dome, its brass ribs sweating candle fog above the instruments. <words>34</words>
Throughout rehearsals, I speak to the stars as if they were jurors considering my last free sunrise. <words>51</words>
Beside my boots lie worn runic bone dice, fossils of chance etched with alphabets that bite the thumb. <words>69</words>
I roll them to spark unstoppable curiosity in the crowd that will soon sip and judge my lines. <words>87</words>
Our venue is also a coffee shop, and I divine applause by reading coffee shop walls that keep changing text. <words>107</words>
Letters bloom and blink, then misalign into riddles that rhyme with my own outlaw name. <words>122</words>
The shifting plaster tells me our destinies are intertwined, braided like lariats that catch the same falling star. <words>140</words>
She enters as the shutters stir, an astronomer with ink on her gloves and a compass scar near her lip. <words>160</words>
Her voice is virtually peculiar, tuned halfway between ballroom etiquette and locomotive whistle. <words>173</words>
Throughout rehearsals she calibrates the orrery while I polish metaphors, our hands moving in mirrored hesitation. <words>189</words>
We pretend indifference, yet the dome amplifies our saturated ambivalence into thunder that trembles the coffee cups. <words>206</words>
She asks what I seek besides applause, and I answer that I want a map of mistakes guiding wanderers home. <words>226</words>
She laughs like coals settling, then invites me to misalign the main lens and see what else appears. <words>244</words>
I crank the gear the wrong way, and the sky jerks, revealing a seam where daylight leaks a secret. <words>263</words>
On the coffee shop wall, letters tumble, spelling that we were born on opposite frontiers at the same minute. <words>282</words>
Her compass scar and my dice pips mirror each other, a private nebula of proof I cannot recant. <words>300</words>
We rehearse a duet, her equations and my stanzas trading breath, and the dome turns with hesitant gratitude. <words>318</words>
The audience in their goggles succumbs to a hush, a silence that feels saddled, bridled, barely breakable. <words>335</words>
I roll the dice again, and they say ride, so I recite a confession about stealing sunsets to pay rent. <words>355</words>
She solves for light lost between towns, and the lens misaligns once more, framing our intertwined destinies as theater. <words>374</words>
Beneath brass constellations we promise not love but inquiry, a vow to walk apart together, outlaw and astronomer. <words>392</words>
The wall writes finally evolve, and I bow, because curiosity is now unstoppable, and the room believes us. <words>410</words>
When the applause erupts, I pocket the worn runic bone dice and look up through our virtually peculiar night. <words>429</words>
Between clicks of cooling metal, I feel every misaligned gear find purpose, and ambivalence saturate into a navigable compass. <words>448</words>
