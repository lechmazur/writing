I am a chef who can taste memories, and tonight the air seasons me with ruminative exasperation. <words>17</words>
I returned to the yodeling valley, where echoes stitch hills into a chorus, in the hush of a stadium before the first pitch. <words>40</words>
Under the retractable roof grown with synthetically organic ivy, my tiny dugout kitchen trembled like a throat clearing for a confession no crowd could hear. <words>65</words>
I unspooled a dull paperclip from my apron, a relic of the mentor I sought to sever toxic ties with, a talisman of binding. <words>89</words>
His recipes still haunted my tongue; every roux tasted like orders barked too close, and I could cook only to appease a voice I despised. <words>114</words>
Tonight, the plan was purification by tracking rain trails along the plastic seats, sipping droplets to locate flavors my childhood had hidden from view. <words>138</words>
Each bead carried a grandstand of voices: spruce resin from my mother yodeling, iron innings from my father keeping score, and summers salted with burnt sugar. <words>164</words>
I tasted these innings until the bitter notes surrendered, and my palate felt the edge soften toward forgiveness' embrace without pretending the past was gentle. <words>189</words>
Beyond the scoreboard, the valley answered with a climbing yodel, a test note held steady in the same hush that made the bases seem ceremonial altars. <words>215</words>
I set a pan on low and coaxed a sauce from synthetically organic mushrooms, rainwater vinegar, and thyme torn like tickets, a marinade for memory itself. <words>241</words>
I bent the paperclip open, not to bind, but to pick the latch on his old recipe box I had swiped, clattering its chains of doctrine. <words>267</words>
Inside lay one yellowed card, instructing me to plate pain as spectacle; I fed it to the flame and watched its edges curl like bitter tongues. <words>293</words>
The stadium loudspeakers breathed, then fell silent again, as if the first pitch reconsidered itself; that pause let me decide how to sever toxic ties cleanly. <words>319</words>
I plated the dish for myself and the ghosts, to appease mouth and memory but not my mentor, exasperated yet steady, tasting complexity without surrendering agency. <words>345</words>
From the tunnels came footsteps, while the valley's yodel braided with them; I cast a line of sauce across the plate like a first pitch finally thrown. <words>372</words>
The spoonful carried rain, resin, and the small sweetness of surviving, and I felt forgiveness' embrace as an arm not around him, but around my future. <words>398</words>
I closed the picked box, left the paperclip bent, and listened for rain. <words>411</words>
