<story>After the final warning tolled through the palace rafters, the disenchanted queen left her crown cooling on a dish of salt. [21]
She walked alone toward the mountains whose ribs cut the dusk, carrying only a map of dreams she had written in sleepless ink. [44]
What drove her was not escape but hunger: to unravel the mystery of recurring dreams that kept curling around her name. [65]
Each night showed her a cobalt grotto above clouds where the stars bled like wounds, and a voice, hers and not hers, invited her to climb. [91]
The court magi called it bleeding starlight, a bad omen that laced the sky with bruised threads and promised a sovereign's unmaking. [113]
She called it a road. [118]
Above the orchards, the path narrowed to a spine of stone, and wind combed her braids with a softly commanding patience. [139]
The first waystation was the ember grotto on the ridge, a cave that breathed warm ash and remembered campfires from summers no historian had written. [164]
There she met a wanderer who wore night moss as a cloak and carried a lantern cupped like an egg. [184]
He bowed without lowering his eyes, as if refusing to show her the emptiness in them. [200]
You are late, he said, but the tone was not reproach so much as thread, pulling her forward. [218]
I am precisely when I can be, she answered, and heard how her voice had learned to be softly commanding even when drifting. [241]
Behind them the kingdom lay like a spilled bracelet, its lights already dimming beneath the bruise of prophecy. [259]
Before them the ridge rose, and far beyond, the cobalt grotto above clouds, slit into the skyline like an eyelid half-open. [280]
We must climb before dawn, the wanderer said, because dawn forgets what night remembers. [294]
He uncovered a flask the color of nicked bone and handed it to her. [308]
They drank, shared the burn, and for a moment their breaths matched and misted, a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer as they rose from the grass like lost sparks. [340]
The fireflies made a small galaxy between them, and the queen felt her dreams braid and tighten, a net asking to be filled with answers. [365]
When they began the climb, stone echoed their soles like a low drum, and the wind took on the voice of a wet veil whisked across tile. [392]
The wanderer walked ahead, but each time she faltered he paused without turning, as if a thread tugged him back through the air. [415]
She wondered what he had been warned against, and what promise bound him to the path after the final warning had scorched the city bells. [440]
At the second ledge they found a pool thick with starlight, and she understood why the court had feared that bleeding, because it looked like a wound refusing to close. [470]
He dipped his fingers and drew a crescent on her brow, not an anointing but a key, cold and precise. [490]
Names are doors, he said, and so are silences. [499]
She told him the name the dreams used, a childhood moniker that had sounded like a dare, and the grotto answered by breathing colder. [523]
Past midnight they reached the cobalt grotto above clouds, whose roof showed night unapologized, every star an opening instead of a pin. [545]
There the queen saw herself sleeping in stone, her body braided from shadows, and threads of starlight entered and exited her, bleeding and returning, patient as tides. [572]
If you wake her, the wanderer warned, you will choose who rules when you go back, and who you will not be able to forgive. [597]
She asked who he was to know this, and the cave released a sigh that tasted of salt and iron. [617]
Once, he said, I kept watch at your cradle, and once again I kept watch at your coronation, and both times the same moth burned itself on the same candle. [647]
The dreams returned because you would not look at the moth, only the flame. [661]
She stepped to the stone self and touched the crescent on its brow, and in that contact felt the lacy menace of power and mercy knotted together. [688]
I do not want the throne to end, she whispered, but I cannot serve it as a ghost of unasked questions. [709]
Then wake, he said, and let the moth lead you away from the flame, into the ink where maps begin. [729]
She breathed, the stone breathed, and they unstitched; she was one again, the dreams not dismissed but worn like a ring that remembered every finger it had ever circled. [758]
When she turned, the wanderer was already leaving, and the pool of starlight had stopped bleeding, calm as an eye that had decided to watch. [783]</story>
