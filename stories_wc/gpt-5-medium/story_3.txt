Between seasons, the sailor's graveyard sighed like a harbor dreaming of wind. <words>12</words>
I kept watch there, a surly watchman hired to mind rusted anchors and salt-bleached memorials. <words>27</words>
The nights carried a dignified chaos, gulls arguing with the tide while lanterns quivered like unsent messages. <words>44</words>
I was serenely frantic, calm hands cataloging storms that hadn't happened yet. <words>56</words>
My pocket kept a short piece of yarn, fiber snapped from a fisher's sweater, a thread that measured my patience. <words>76</words>
Old Mara, my elder, taught me a traditional craft learned from an elder: knot-reading, the tide's cursive. <words>93</words>
She would tie riddles into rope, and I would answer by loosening the coils until meaning appeared. <words>110</words>
Now I practiced alone among tilted stones named for sailors whose compasses had finally agreed with oblivion. <words>127</words>
The yarn was my rosary of currents, wound and unwound as I sought to understand cosmic patterns the sea whispered. <words>147</words>
I listened for market wisdom in the surf, the barter of moonlight and depth, where stars priced every wave's ambition. <words>167</words>
If a gull screamed, I counted its notes against my string; if silence fell, I paid with breath. <words>185</words>
Tonight, the graves gave me a riddle tightened into a sailor's loop, a question older than my lantern's soot. <words>204</words>
What price is fair for the wind you cannot keep, and the harbor you must leave to love? <words>222</words>
I smoothed the yarn across a stone and worked the knots, each motion precise, serenely frantic, dignity moving through disorder. <words>242</words>
Market wisdom answered first: you pay with departure, you profit with return, and you owe interest to memory. <words>260</words>
But the knots tugged deeper, insisting I weigh the sky's ledger, where constellations are IOUs scrawled by weather and doubt. <words>280</words>
I thought of Mara trading lullabies for warnings, of captains swapping years for one more chart, of my own sour watchfulness taxing every dawn. <words>304</words>
So I untied the riddle until it became a map, and the map became a vow to escort the restless safely ashore. <words>326</words>
Between seasons, I would sell nothing and buy nothing, yet trade my silence for bearings, returning profit to the dead in candles. <words>348</words>
The watch grew less surly, more exacting, as the graves and the tide struck their dignified chaos into the yarn's memory. <words>369</words>
Night by night, I learned the traditional craft as if anew, reading the twine like scripture, hearing Mara in each tightening breath. <words>391</words>
When dawn finally priced the horizon, the riddle paid out: understanding was not possession, but a ferry running eternally on shared fare. <words>413</words>
