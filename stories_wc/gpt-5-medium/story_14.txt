I am a naive gambler monitoring tides for a living. <words>10</words>
My post is the tidal power monitoring station clinging to a stone spit where ferries hesitate. <words>26</words>
Most nights we dock our skiff by feel, trusting a rope, a whistle, and the moon. <words>42</words>
Luck here is rarely predictable, which suits me like salt in a wound and a cure. <words>58</words>
Power flickers, so we eat during candlelit dinners, laughing tears over tins and weather maps. <words>73</words>
A rustic candle mold lives by the window, found in a drowned shed and polished by storms. <words>90</words>
We pour tallow into its ribs when the grid sulks, patient as an old priest. <words>105</words>
The professors arrived in autumn, unhinged and brilliant, smuggling revolution via rebellious midnight lectures by unhinged professors. <words>122</words>
They taught me that every turbine blade signs unspoken bargains with currents, debts the shore pays by erosion. <words>140</words>
They said my wagers were the same, slips of paper pressed against the wet cheek of time. <words>157</words>
I smiled and shuffled, but their words kept burning under my tongue like stray sparks. <words>172</words>
There is a reason I keep taking the night shift, chasing the creak of buoys and gull curses. <words>190</words>
I am trying to capture one last spark before oblivion, a laugh that refuses to shut the door. <words>208</words>
It might be the station, rumored to close when the new array wakes and renders us quaint. <words>225</words>
It might be my heart, which placed a foolish bet on Mira, the junior analyst who counts swells. <words>243</words>
We play cards with shadows when the surge meters hum, and she always calls my bluff with a grin. <words>262</words>
Her stories bend like kelp, rarely predictable, as if the ocean taught her to dance while drowning. <words>279</words>
Tonight a storm hollers upriver, and the professors propose a toast to entropy with tea and contraband philosophy. <words>297</words>
We eat during candlelit dinners though the hour is late, and the mold gives birth to tiny suns. <words>315</words>
Mira leans close and asks what odds I would lay against the sea taking our names. <words>331</words>
I answer with unspoken bargains, a glance through salt fog, promising to lose everything if she stays. <words>348</words>
She laughs, then cries, then laughs again, laughing tears that taste like batteries and home. <words>363</words>
Outside, the surge crests, and we rush to the instruments, to the bolts, to the shuddering doors. <words>380</words>
I dock the data stream manually as the network stutters, fingers slick with rain and fear. <words>396</words>
Mira steadies the candle, flame mulish and bright, while the professors recite equations like lullabies. <words>411</words>
For a breath everything holds, station and skiff and love and ledger, and the turbines sing back. <words>428</words>
In that ringing cradle I find my wager, not against the sea, but with it. <words>443</words>
If oblivion comes, it will know our names because we carved them in light, spark by borrowed spark. <words>461</words>
