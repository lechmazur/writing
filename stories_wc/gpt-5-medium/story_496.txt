<story>I was a repressed poet who disguised panic as meter and called it style. <words>14</words>
On a humid evening, I made a spontaneous decision to explore a side road nobody used anymore. <words>31</words>
The city there had been reclaimed by nature, an overgrown street where moss braided the curbstones and saplings stitched green sutures through the asphalt. <words>55</words>
In my pocket clinked an antique perfume bottle, its stopper a small comet, its scent remembering gardens I never dared enter. <words>76</words>
I carried it because I intended to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin, and perfume makes ink braver than blood. <words>97</words>
With knowing naivety I told myself the poem would sweeten the world, though I was secretly terrified it would expose me instead. <words>119</words>
I walked deeper, letting vines brush my wrists like rehearsals for lines I meant to write across a stranger's pulse. <words>139</words>
At the moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor, a decision can feel holy, and the street held that kind of hush. <words>163</words>
It was then the ambush arrived, not with knives, but with children of ruin, cats and crows springing from a rusted bus like punctuation marks. <words>188</words>
They startled me into stillness, and stillness loosened the old gag I had tied around my voice years ago. <words>207</words>
Lingering doubts crowded close, asking whether words deserve bodies, and whether bodies must consent to constellations they cannot see. <words>226</words>
I uncorked the bottle, the air steeping in ghosted sandalwood, and thought of a lover who had offered her wrist like night sky. <words>249</words>
Back then I had swallowed my desire, repressed it into couplets, and watched her leave with starless skin and patience I mistook for mercy. <words>273</words>
Tonight, among sap green barricades, I vowed to write what I had feared, a cosmic verse that mapped her names across my own breathing. <words>297</words>
I pressed the bottle's mouth to my forearm and traced galaxies in scent, hoping the skin would memorize the sky I could not speak. <words>321</words>
From the bus roof, a crow leaned close as if to edit, and the cats patrolled like critics who had forgiven nothing. <words>343</words>
I understood their patience as grace, and my pulse calmed enough to hear the corridor within me, the place where a pin is always heard. <words>368</words>
Out of that hush I summoned her memory fully, not as a wound but as the skin that once waited, and I addressed it aloud. <words>393</words>
I apologized for my distance, for the ambush I staged with silence, and promised bolder handwriting tomorrow. <words>410</words>
The perfume evaporated into night, leaving letters no eye could see, yet my arms carried constellations the crows grudgingly approved. <words>430</words>
I walked back toward the city, no longer disguised, and every cracked window became a page where doubts would read me and be read. <words>454</words>
