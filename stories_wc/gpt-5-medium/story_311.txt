In the lunar greenhouse clinging to a crater's edge, I stand as a tense bodyguard, breathing the mint of engineered moss and holding a serene anger. <words>26</words>
Director Vale requires my shadow at all hours, claiming safety, but I know control when it tugs my leash through sealed corridors and scheduled smiles. <words>51</words>
In my sleeve I hide a faded photograph, its corners soft as lunar dust, showing my sister laughing beside an Earthside park fountain. <words>74</words>
Her image returns amid park visits scheduled in the habitat dome, when colonists stroll beneath projection trees and pretend the recycled breeze invented childhood. <words>98</words>
I work by collecting fragments of overheard stories, shavings of gossip that drift like pollen, because information grows roots even in low gravity. <words>121</words>
I am serendipitously stubborn, resisting opportunity until it insists on itself, then gripping it with the patience of a vacuum seal. <words>142</words>
From the hydroponics pumps I overhear that Vale plans to ratify a resource treaty that mortgages our oxygen farms to a remote board. <words>165</words>
It will formalize his controlling influence, turning my bodyguard badge into a collar, and the colony's promises into promissory notes. <words>185</words>
I plan a timely rebirth, for me and for the greenhouse, pruning what strangles the roots so new leaves might breathe. <words>206</words>
The faded photograph guides me, a compass that spins only toward unguarded laughter, toward a future where park visits do not need permission slips. <words>230</words>
By the airlock I collect more fragments, hearing that Vale fears fungi outbreaks and that he keeps his panic hidden inside the soundproofed office garden. <words>255</words>
I arrange an interruption grown from ecology, harmless but persuasive, a bloom timed to unfurl during the treaty ceremony and stain his confidence with orange spores. <words>281</words>
On the day, my posture is still as basalt, serenity stretched across anger like a thin pond film, while guests clink cups under ultraviolet lamps. <words>306</words>
When Vale moves to ratify the treaty, the engineered lilies erupt, spores painting his lapel; I whisper his private fears back to him, piece by overheard piece. <words>333</words>
I tell him the colony knows, that we refuse auction, that I resign his leash and will escort the petitioners demanding a vote he cannot choreograph. <words>359</words>
Vale blanches, calculating, but the room has already breathed differently, and my serenity refuses to ripple, my anger content to watch him learn air. <words>383</words>
That night, amid park visits in the dome, the gardeners and machinists ratify a living charter, prioritizing breath over profit and pruning authority like diseased stems. <words>409</words>
I fold the photograph into my breast pocket, finally free, and become a bodyguard again, this time to the greenhouse itself, keeping watch over our timely rebirth. <words>436</words>
