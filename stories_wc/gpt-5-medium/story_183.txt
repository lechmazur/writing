<story>I arrived at the abandoned theatre when memory flickers into legend, the evening sky folded like vellum around a dim, patient silence. <words>22</words> The entrance kept its hush with chipped mosaic tiles, each shard a syllable that refused to speak until my feet asked gently. <words>44</words> I am a restless wayfarer, unbelievably ordinary, except for the stubborn itch to learn the language of the universe. <words>63</words> Every village had told me there was no grammar to infinity, only rumor, so I walked into rumor as if it were home. <words>86</words> The vintage hat box swung from my hand, scuffed, circular, unbelievably ordinary again, an heirloom that insisted on being a map. <words>107</words> Its lid creaked open only when night breathed, and inside lay pathways of contradiction drawn in chalk that never smeared. <words>127</words> Go there and you return, go home and you depart, the lines warned, and my pulse agreed with their unreason. <words>147</words> So I pressed the hat box to the threshold and asked the stones for a release. <words>163</words> It came through the chipped mosaic tiles at the entrance to an abandoned theatre, a soft exhale that parted a dimensional rift. <words>185</words> The air grew intensely quiet, as if hush were a substance poured carefully between moments. <words>200</words> Light arranged itself like notation, and I heard no sound, yet I felt tense vowels brushing my skin. <words>218</words> I stepped inward, and the theatre inverted, its balconies folding into plains, its stage diffusing into horizons I could nearly hum. <words>239</words> Memory flickered into legend behind me, then ahead of me, time looping like a bracelet that fastens itself whenever I doubt. <words>260</words> In that pliable hush, the pathways of contradiction blossomed into doors, each door labeled with a plain word I had misused all my life. <words>284</words> Here was And, there was Or, further on a narrow gate named Maybe, and beyond it a vestibule called Silence. <words>304</words> The hat box clicked, disapproving of my awe, then released a ribbon that unspooled into a line I could walk. <words>324</words> I followed, unbelievably ordinary, feeling the grand machinery of cosmos reduce itself to everyday grammar, subject, breath, verb. <words>342</words> When I stepped on the word And, I was two people, both wandering, both resting, a contradiction that held without argument. <words>363</words> When I stood upon Or, I learned choice is not division but resonance, two notes that meet and make a third. <words>384</words> In Silence, the language of the universe finally turned its face, unbelievably ordinary, and asked my name as though it were asking itself. <words>407</words> I answered by releasing the breath I had been saving since childhood, a small release, a necessary one, and the doors nodded. <words>429</words> The rift did not close; it widened into a field where theatre seats were constellations, and the aisle a river back to streets I knew. <words>454</words> I walked out carrying nothing but the vintage hat box, now empty, or full, depending on how you read the pauses between footsteps. <words>477</words> By the time dawn arrived, legend had flickered back into memory, and the mosaic kept its chips, and I kept the language. <words>499</words></story>
