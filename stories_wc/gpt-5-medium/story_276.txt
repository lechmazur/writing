I arrived at the orbital debris tracking station as an uneasy emissary from a planet that barely trusted its own reflections. <words>21</words>
They wanted me to learn universal patterns, but they sent only questions, thin funding, and a diet of powdered apricots. <words>41</words>
Accidental wisdom became my tone because plans were luxuries the station denied like fresh gravity or unbroken sleep. <words>59</words>
On my first shift I felt the whole array lurch, a nudge from some shy moonlet announcing intention in a clumsy dialect of drag. <words>83</words>
The radar blooms were consistently surprising, irregular like snow fallen through wire and rumor. <words>97</words>
In the commissary, morale hung on a corkboard beside a humming fridge, where someone kept old landscapes and recipes clipped into postcards. <words>119</words>
I learned more through the rustle of postcards pinned to a fridge door than from any memo stamped with official orbit. <words>140</words>
As lunches cooled, the maintenance crew told stories of heatscored bolts and family picnics on spillway lawns beneath carefully exploding suns. <words>161</words>
Their talk branched like trajectories, and I heard in every tangent the branches of redemption, twigs of chance that might cradle a falling world. <words>185</words>
I mapped debris storms onto those tales, tracing mythic splinters to numbered orbits, and each overlay steadied the emissary who kept shivering inside me. <words>209</words>
At night I straightened antenna filaments with a thin coathanger, touching the wounded metal like a parent adjusting a feverish brow. <words>230</words>
Signals, once sullen, began to answer, and on the panels the garbage of empires drew shy constellations that no star would dare contradict. <words>253</words>
Throughout picnics scheduled to keep us human, I took notes on ketchup-stained napkins, discovering ratios in smudges, symmetries in the way crumbs avoided shadows. <words>277</words>
It was not superstition; it was the universe practicing with small props, rehearsing the choreography of forgiveness where mass and chance bow to patience. <words>301</words>
One noon the horizon sighed, and the station seemed to lurch again, not from collision but from decision, as if the sky adjusted its seat. <words>326</words>
A derelict panel veered to spare a weather satellite, and in the reprieve I recognized my posting: to be an emissary between wreckage and will. <words>351</words>
I radioed the crew in a voice still uneasy, yet I spoke of routes that learned to bend, of errors taking root as branches of redemption. <words>377</words>
By shift change we were consistently surprising ourselves, passing the coathanger like a scepter, and the fridge postcards whispered that patterns forgive when humans listen. <words>402</words>
