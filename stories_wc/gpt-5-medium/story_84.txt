At noon amid sidewalk sales, I, an overly dramatic actor, arrived in the city built on the shells of gargantuan turtles. <words>21</words>
I carried a cracked leather case whose handle squeaked like a stage whisper, announcing both my fatigue and my purpose. <words>41</words>
My purpose was simple, desperate, and oddly seldom understood: to outplay an omnipotent foe without drawing his unblinking spotlight. <words>60</words>
He collected hearts like props, and he would repossess any tenderness that was not guarded by craft, cunning, or applause. <words>80</words>
So I rehearsed a new act, a performed kindness tuned to a hush, a gift shaped as a perfect cue. <words>100</words>
The city, balanced on turtle domes, moved with frenzied tranquility, every stall sliding slowly while hawkers chanted deals at lightning pace. <words>121</words>
Old televisions flickered under parasols, loops of commercials from forgotten decades playing to tempt passersby with miracle soaps and miracle promises. <words>142</words>
Within those jingles lurked the map to his lair, solvable only via matching riddles hidden in old commercials that nobody bought. <words>163</words>
I cued my breath, counted beats, and traded jokes for clues, insisting each seller accept compliments as currency for a fragment. <words>184</words>
Kindness works oddly seldom here, because charity suggests weakness, and weakness invites repossession by the foe whose name is Always. <words>204</words>
But if kindness is performed, if it wears blocking marks and breathes on cue, it becomes armor the tyrant cannot seize. <words>225</words>
I opened the cracked leather case and drew costumes: a volunteer's vest, a conductor's baton, and a smile rehearsed to sincerity. <words>246</words>
At the first booth, I organized a queue, aligning strangers' grievances with the rhythm of an old jingle about orderly noodles. <words>267</words>
The vendor laughed, then whispered the riddle's answer, which matched a toothpaste ad promising brightness if you never swallow what stains. <words>288</words>
At the next, I became a crossing guard for words, letting apologies pass, stopping insults, and receiving a melody about lemonade clocks. <words>310</words>
Each performed kindness unlocked another rhyme, until the path spelled itself across turtle shells like chalk lines, glowing under shoe scuffs. <words>331</words>
I walked that path to the central plaza, where Always loomed as a billboard of eyes, omnipotent and omnipresent, selling fear. <words>352</words>
He promised refunds on every hope, offering to repossess my kindness for store credit, which would expire the instant applause faded. <words>373</words>
I bowed, then staged my finale: I matched the last riddle to a charity ad, and handed him the answer as service. <words>395</words>
The billboard crabbed, pixels writhing, yet he could not seize a kindness already spent, a gratuity settled before his ledger. <words>415</words>
The crowd, half panicked and half serene, felt the frenzied tranquility pass through them like surf, and the turtles exhaled. <words>435</words>
My case closed with relief, and I walked on, oddly seldom saluted, yet secretly applauded by streets that no longer trembled. <words>456</words>
In their slow drift, the city carried me forward, choosing my next scene, another booth, another riddle, another kindness to perform. <words>477</words>
And Always, diminished, learned the one script he could not edit: generosity that moves before it is watched, yet leaves echoes. <words>498</words>
