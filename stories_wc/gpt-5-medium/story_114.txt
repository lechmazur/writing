After the last breath of a dying god, the shared dream recording studio hummed like a low tide inside a sleeping shell. <words>22</words>
I was the apathetic summoner on shift, enthusiastically lazy enough to move only when stillness complained. <words>38</words>
My tools were lucid microphones, spools of night wind, and a rustic coffee grinder that made aromas wake forgotten estuaries. <words>58</words>
The river wisdom I needed for the reefs arrived not with thunder but with sediment, patient syllables rolling over stone. <words>78</words>
We captured currents as dreams, then trimmed them to length and key, because rhythm trains water to remember polyps. <words>97</words>
In the deserted hall outside the booth, matching empty frames hung face to face like patient gills awaiting breath. <words>116</words>
I learned to step through matching empty frames hanging in a deserted hall, and the world would unfold into layered currents. <words>137</words>
Each passage delivered me to a different sleeper whose river carried a different song for coral to hum against moonlight. <words>157</words>
Some nights the god's fading exhale still echoed there, a husk of power that stirred dunes like cloth lifted from water. <words>178</words>
I ground crystals of salt and limestone in the grinder, letting their scent sketch maps for juvenile reefs to follow. <words>198</words>
Because I was enthusiastically lazy, my summons were small, exacting, and they traveled farther than grand gestures ever could. <words>217</words>
I asked for pebble patience, for algal lullabies, for the tiny hunger that teaches stones to soften into sand. <words>236</words>
Dream by dream, I recorded these waters, giving their notes to the archive where currents could be mixed like tracks. <words>256</words>
When they played back across the spillways near the charred reefs, the sea paused, listened, and began to stitch itself. <words>276</words>
I saw polyps bud like careful commas, each pause a breath, each breath a promise that did not need me to hurry. <words>298</words>
Still, the studio kept asking for more, lights blinking with gentle sharpness that pricked the margin of my practiced indifference. <words>318</words>
So I tuned the empty frames to pair shoal with shoal, river with reef, summoner with the quiet labor of months. <words>339</words>
Through them, I let the world unfold slowly, a careful spill, trust built on repetition and the resilience of small lives. <words>360</words>
The god would not return, but its last breath became a metronome, steadying the waves as seedlings took their first risks. <words>381</words>
I stayed apathetic to praise, yet faithful to the motive that hauled me from my cot each dusk: to rebuild coral reefs. <words>403</words>
