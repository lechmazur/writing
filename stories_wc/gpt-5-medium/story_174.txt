<story>
I am a wandering fireworks designer with pockets of ash and maps burned into memory. <words>15</words>
People call my ideas theoretically creative, but I know they are apologies learning to glow without exploding. <words>32</words>
I travel because I carry a regret like a failed fuse, and I am trying to correct a life's regret. <words>52</words>
When winter laces the town, I read my maps through the patterns in frost on a car window. <words>70</words>
The frost braids timelines so lightly that subtle paths unfolding look like breath, and the breath changes everything. <words>88</words>
Tonight the frost points me toward a roar I have chased since childhood, a waterfall that keeps a secret door. <words>108</words>
Behind its curtain waits a hidden library in a waterfall, lanterns bobbing like minnows of borrowed light. <words>125</words>
Shelves ripple with books stitched from riverweed, and the air tastes of stone, ink, and second chances. <words>142</words>
I open my collection of pressed leaves, pages of autumn I stole lovingly, each leaf veined like a patient equation. <words>162</words>
The leaves are my index, and the library rustles, recognizing their brittle whisper as the password I once forgot. <words>181</words>
I had left someone waiting under fireworks that never bloomed, and I have wandered ever since, rehearsing better constellations. <words>200</words>
Here, within the ephemeral nature of time, the spines align into an aisle, and the cascade hushes to listen. <words>219</words>
Every title is a question I have already asked, which is why the place feels like a familiar puzzle solved slowly. <words>240</words>
My hands tremble as I augment the index by sliding a silvered birch leaf into a gap whispering my name. <words>260</words>
Waterlight flares, and a book loosens itself, pages filmed with dew that arranges into a blueprint for a gentler ignition. <words>280</words>
The blueprint shows a square, an empty plaza, and a lone figure waiting; not a lover, but the friend who steadied ladders. <words>302</words>
I see the night I failed him by choosing spectacle over presence, and the book suggests a rehearsal that tips the scale. <words>324</words>
Frost-thin script tells me to design echoes that bloom like apologies, and to launch them through absence rather than air. <words>344</words>
I craft charges whose sparks travel through the patterns in frost on a car window, so his morning will deliver the show. <words>366</words>
The library lends me a quiet wick and a page of permissions, while the waterfall signs the waiver in silver cursive. <words>387</words>
I step back outside, and the frost has already begun to speak, floral filigree spelling his name along the glass. <words>407</words>
I light the wick, memory catching, and the car becomes a lantern for the shy mathematics of repair. <words>425</words>
Sparks drift not upward but sideways, threading the morning with subtle paths unfolding toward the plaza where he once waited. <words>445</words>
I follow as if reading braille written by weather, and each step feels less like wandering and more like arriving. <words>465</words>
He meets the message first, a bloom of frost that says I am sorry, and his face lifts like dawn. <words>485</words>
I arrive late, and our silence closes the circuit I once broke. <words>497</words>
