I stood on the abandoned carnival roller coaster track, breath ragged, in the seconds following a sudden revelation that split my world open. <words>23</words>
I had practiced spontaneity for years, rehearsing panic until it sounded like jazz, but this felt like an audition with the sky itself. <words>46</words>
No one knew I was a secret astral projector, a traveler who slipped from body to breeze when corners became knives. <words>67</words>
Around my neck clinked an antique brass key, warm as a heartbeat, heavy as a promise I was not ready to break. <words>89</words>
The revelation was simple and monstrous: the only exit could be found by tracking sun shadows that stitched a hidden map along the rails. <words>113</words>
Shadows moved fast, and I had to move faster, a rule I carried since childhood to preserve survival skills when storms mispronounced my name. <words>137</words>
From the platform, the track buckled like a serpent, cars rusted into altars, cotton candy ghosts sugaring the wind with bitter nostalgia. <words>159</words>
I told myself I would sometimes always stop to help, even if I had to flee right after, because unyielding compassion was my only credible weapon. <words>185</words>
Tonight that vow felt traitorous, yet abandoning it would make my spirit thin, a kite with no string when I projected. <words>206</words>
A boy crouched under the first drop, eyes reflecting the sun like coins at the bottom of a dry wishing fountain. <words>227</words>
He had followed me for blocks, certain I could read light, certain my key could open a door none of us could see. <words>250</words>
I said nothing and let my consciousness slip, the body humming on autopilot while my astral self climbed the skeleton with hawk patience. <words>273</words>
Above, the sun stitched black ribbons along the rails, arrowheads pointing where the key should turn, where old laughter once greased the metal. <words>296</words>
Below, my body coaxed the boy with jokes, practiced spontaneity making shelter from syllables, keeping him still while time flowed like startled fish. <words>319</words>
I found the lock where the rust turned shy, slid the antique brass key inside the hush, and felt the track breathe. <words>341</words>
The revelation sharpened: this ride had been designed as an escape route for those who listened to light, a clandestine syllabus for survivors. <words>364</words>
I reentered my skin, grabbed the boy, and we moved by tracking sun shadows across each creaking rib, our steps a studied improvisation. <words>387</words>
When sirens coughed nearby, I wanted to flee, but compassion anchored us, and the lock yawned open into daylight shaped like a second chance. <words>411</words>
We stepped through and sealed it, not with fear but with a promise to sometimes always listen, because survival without mercy forgets how to survive. <words>436</words>
Behind us the carnival exhaled, and ahead the city brightened, and I felt my secret drifting like a kite, tethered, willing, fiercely returned. <words>459</words>
