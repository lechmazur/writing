I keep watch from the space pirate ship crow's nest, a desert wanderer tasting starlight, listening for the moment when the orchard's last apple finally falls. <words>26</words>
My duty is not looting but to archive sacred knowledge, and the sky keeps secreting footnotes nobody reads. <words>44</words>
Loaded with curiosity, I angle my hearing toward the rigging, where radiation hums like bees grazing a myth. <words>62</words>
In my pocket rests a brass ruler, nicked from a scholar we ransomed, its edge trued by desert winds and patient ruin. <words>84</words>
With it I measure research not in pages but in sparks gathered by investigating everyday miracles: a torn sail that still whispers, a compass that points to sorrow. <words>112</words>
Tonight I study translated love, the way a stolen galaxy says thank you through tidal lullabies only pirates and wanderers are broken enough to hear. <words>137</words>
Our quartermaster is authentically artificial, a sandborn automaton whose voice carries thirst; she logs our plunder in poems and corrects my star names with kindness. <words>162</words>
From the crow's nest, I catalogue miracles so ordinary they hide in grease: a pulley that forgives, boots that learn your stride, silence that stitches mutiny shut. <words>189</words>
Below, the captain tends our pocket orchard, and I wait for when the orchard's last apple finally falls, because the hull listens for that drum. <words>214</words>
On that sound we make a turn, and I will mark it so some future thirsty soul can archive sacred knowledge of our strange bearings. <words>239</words>
I was a desert wanderer before the sails found me, a cartographer of heat who mapped mirages to see which lies sheltered real water. <words>263</words>
The brass ruler remembers; I press it to the rail and measure the distance between two shouted orders, then convert it into a treaty between frightened hearts. <words>290</words>
The quartermaster nods and offers an equation for translated love, where theft minus hunger equals grace, provided we pay with songs and rebuild what we break. <words>316</words>
So our research continues by investigating everyday miracles, our curiosity loaded like cannons but aimed at mercy, our ledgers thick with repairs, apologies, and star names newly pronounced. <words>344</words>
At last the apple falls, a soft knock across the ribs of the ship, and the captain winks up as I etch the moment into brass. <words>370</words>
We swing starward toward a desert moon where exiles barter memory, because every turn must justify itself as translated love, not simply appetite dressed as law. <words>396</words>
The authentically artificial quartermaster and I trade oaths to return what stories we can, and to keep none we cannot carry without thirsting worse. <words>420</words>
When the hold quiets, I tuck the brass ruler back and scribble our archive of sacred knowledge, certain dawn will ask for proof, and curious, we will answer. <words>448</words>
