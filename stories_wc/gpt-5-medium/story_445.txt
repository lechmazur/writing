During the hush as two longtime friends part ways, the sleepy nomad cinched his coat in the secret agent disguise room. <words>21</words>
He lifted a dusty box containing a circus strongman's broken barbells, their plates spider-cracked, their collars nicked by boastful performances. <words>41</words>
Once, they had symbolized invincibility, but now he carried them as ballast against the downfall of arrogance he had witnessed. <words>61</words>
His friend Mira, all edges and resolve, tested wigs on a mannequin head like a priestess of pragmatic omens. <words>80</words>
They had been recruited through a chance encounter while lost on a hiking trail, where a fox led them to an unmarked door. <words>103</words>
Inside, agents whispered about missions dressed as festivals, and the masquerade became both toolkit and trap for the faithful and the vain. <words>125</words>
The sleepy nomad believed in fantasy practicality, that a cloak works best when woven from equal threads of dream and schedule. <words>146</words>
Mira, however, trusted only hard edges, and lately her glances measured distances not between masks, but between hearts. <words>164</words>
They were parting because she would infiltrate the mountain conclave alone, insisting limits were illusions that yielded to sufficient force. <words>184</words>
He, carrying the broken barbells, vowed to blaze a trail through intangible limits by listening for paths others called silence. <words>204</words>
The weight in his bag was spiritually material, proof that some burdens instruct without crushing, and some trophies bruise the shoulders that boast. <words>227</words>
Mira laughed softly, then tightened a throat-microphone until her voice sounded like river stones grinding under snowmelt. <words>244</words>
She said the fox was a handler, not an omen, and that fate behaves when commanded firmly. <words>261</words>
His eyes fogged with travel-tiredness, yet he saw in her certainty the first cracks forming, hairlines like those on the iron plates. <words>283</words>
Before they split, they rehearsed one last masquerade, swapping coats, names, and habits, so the corridors themselves would second-guess their parting. <words>304</words>
He pressed a plate from the barbells into her palm, an agreement that humility weighs less than regret when mountains listen. <words>325</words>
On the trail beyond the facility, switchbacks braided fog, and he met the fox again by sheer accident, as if scheduled by awe. <words>348</words>
It glanced back, guiding him toward a hidden spur where a chorus of unseen bells marked footsteps more reliable than maps. <words>369</words>
He understood that arrogance falls by slipping on its own glare, while patience treads on echoes and arrives with clean boots. <words>390</words>
Behind him, Mira entered the conclave disguised as their legend, but the mountain unmasked her certainty, and the doors sighed shut. <words>411</words>
He felt the hush echo through the pines, and carried on, faithful to a route that trusted living questions over finished answers. <words>433</words>
By dusk he was a sleepy nomad with clear eyes, stepping lightly, knowing that to blaze unseen trails is the only lasting strength. <words>456</words>
