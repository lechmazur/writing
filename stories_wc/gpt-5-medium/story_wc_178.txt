<story>Dusk clung to the courtyards as I tallied oil and chalk in my pocket ledger. [15]
The rooms were an ancient babylonian palace reimagined as an observatory, all doors tuned to stars. [31]
Between regimes, we kept the place breathing with cheap repairs and patient hours. [44]
I was the frugal astronomer, apprentice to no lord, paying attention instead of rents. [58]
From a cracked drain, I pried loose a magic square tile, its surface scratched with sums. [74]
Each line totaled the same, but the grid also mapped doorways, pools, and shadowed niches. [89]
Numbers became corridors, and corridors became a vow laid out in quiet numbers. [102]
It felt like encrypted devotion, expressed not in incense but in arithmetic and stone. [116]
Such piety suited me, because what I could afford were pencils, not sacrificial calves. [130]
The palace had been abandoned by its kings but claimed by the planets for timing. [145]
Walls held bronze pins where once curtains hung, now anchoring thin wires that marked risings. [160]
I copied the tile onto papyrus through schematic representations, overlaying courtyards with the numeral script. [175]
Where the sums met, the schematics showed three arcs converging on a blind alcove. [189]
There, the plaster buckled like a dried river, and the air hummed against my teeth. [204]
I waited for Saturn to clear the tower, counting breaths to spare lamp oil. [218]
Frugality is a lens; it keeps only what you can see by the sky's grace. [233]
When the planet lifted, I aligned wires with the arcs, a poor man's astrolabe. [247]
Shadow traced the lattice, and a faint note sounded where no instrument stood. [260]
In that note was dusk itself, a dusky harmony like violet silk torn to ribbons. [275]
If the tile was prayer, the sound was answer, empirically ironic and unashamed. [288]
I had mocked rites when they burned grain, yet I counted angles like a penitent. [303]
The alcove held a thin layer of soot that shivered, uncurling from the wall. [317]
I breathed out to uncloak what lay behind, as the wires sang their hushed chord. [332]
Plaster fell in gray feathers, revealing a recess shaped like the constant at the grid's heart. [348]
Within sat an urn of fired clay, its lid sealed with bitumen and scratched with stars. [364]
Around it ran grooves matching the square, channels for water or light, or attention. [378]
Attention is a currency dearer than silver, yet it costs a patient body to pay. [393]
I poured a palmful from the cistern, letting rivulets track the arithmetic's invisible threads. [407]
The water split into equal sums, circled the urn, and stopped upon a single bead. [422]
I pressed the bead, and the lid sighed, the room tasting suddenly of pepper and rain. [438]
Inside lay no gold, only an ivory disk etched with the same square in minuscule script. [454]
At the center, a hole, not quite round, awaited a thread wiped with bitumen. [468]
The disk turned as I pulled, and the wires quivered, and the note deepened into breath. [484]
No god presented a face; the wall unscrolled a map of winds, canals, and seekers. [499]
It told of famine years, and flood years, and library doors sealed at noon. [513]
It asked for a steward who could promise nothing except maintenance of the listening wires. [528]
I knew my motive clearer then, to seal a covenant with the unknown without grandeur. [543]
Not a bargain for power, but a pledge to keep the arithmetic waking each dusk. [558]
Between regimes, a vow must be encoded, or it will be ground with the plaster. [573]
So I wrote my name within the square, in strokes so faint they read as sums. [589]
I pledged oil when oil was spare, and hours when hours were kinder than coin. [604]
I swore to repair pins, replace wires, and keep the frugal record of the stars. [619]
The room exhaled, a coolness that smelled of reeds, and the disk ceased turning. [633]
I replaced the lid and the bead, tempered the plaster, and brushed my footprints backward. [648]
No sign remained but the wires, singing sometimes when a planet rounded the south corner. [663]
People will call it superstition, because it works without a king and without spectacle. [677]
I call it keeping faith by careful measures, empirically ironic in a palace of myths. [692]
Tomorrow I will mend a gutter, and mark a rising, and listen for the dusky harmony. [708]
When regimes change again, the tile will be taken for a puzzle, and thus survive. [723]
And somewhere beyond the spheres, the unknown will note my thrift and keep its end of quiet. [740]</story>
