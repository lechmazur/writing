<story>Between text messages, I return to the spontaneous combustion lab that once carried my crest on its soot-blackened lintel. <words>19</words>
The colleagues remember my grants but not my name, a forgotten noble flaking quietly like paint under the burners. <words>38</words>
I pretend this anonymity is a controlled variable, though the hollowness in my chest vibrates with a recklessness I cannot publish. <words>59</words>
Candor in small moments is the only solvent we can smuggle past institutional inertia, and I have come to pour it. <words>80</words>
I hold an artificial hummingbird drone, jittering like a guilty heartbeat, its carbon beak designed to taste heat before flame. <words>100</words>
Its wings lift ash motes into constellations that feel mysteriously obvious, as though the room already knew the shapes of our confessions. <words>122</words>
They ask why I insisted on a lab that births fire from nothing, and I answer simply: to cut through illusions. <words>143</words>
In the hush before notifications bloom, I unpack a shoebox filled with old ticket stubs from operas, trains, and tribunals. <words>163</words>
Each stub is a receipt for a promise I failed or kept badly, and I will fortify our experiment through the reassembly of old ticket stubs. <words>189</words>
We paste them into a lattice over the burn chamber, a paper shield that believes in cause, effect, and honest heat. <words>210</words>
My assistants joke that this is superstition with office supplies, yet their wrists stop shaking when the feathers hum. <words>229</words>
I tell them the obvious is often mysterious because it waits for our small braveries, the ones nobody funds but everyone needs. <words>251</words>
The drone sips the air and chirps a warning, a bright pinprick note that pries open the room like a crowbar. <words>272</words>
Under the paper lattice, the chamber mutters, and the first spontaneous bloom licks the glass without searing, as if reconsidering violence. <words>293</words>
I speak aloud my worst calculus, the ruined patronage, the family vault serving as a filing cabinet, the exile I chose before they could. <words>317</words>
We measure the flame curve bend as my sentences reduce their lies, and the data draws a straight line through a thicket of ghosts. <words>341</words>
It becomes mysteriously obvious that combustion, like lineage, resists enclosure until the vessel admits the pressure it already holds. <words>360</words>
Another text buzzes, a demand for results with no risk, and I let it starve unread while the hummingbird maps the heat like a cartographer. <words>385</words>
Between messages, truth burns cleanest, cooling the room the way confession cools a fever, and everyone breathes as if newly invented. <words>406</words>
I offer the lab my last heirloom, a ring pawned and repurchased, its circle taped above the viewport with another ticket stub. <words>428</words>
The flame steadies as if recognizing a crest not of blood but of intent, a seal pressed by hollow recklessness made honest. <words>450</words>
When the notification finally lands, I answer with data points and a single unadorned sentence, the kind that cannot combust because it is already ash. <words>475</words>
