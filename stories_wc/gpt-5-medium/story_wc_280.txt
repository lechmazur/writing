<story>After the business closes, I lock the glass doors of the converted playhouse and pocket the hand-painted tarot coin. [19]
The coin shows the Star, but the paint shivers like spilled music whenever I touch it. [35]
That is how my synesthetically blessed senses warn me that the night is tuned for more than sweeping up programs. [55]
Behind the theater, a hedge maze hides a mystic orchard garden where apples lean as if listening from branches. [74]
I push through its leafy corridors, following a chord of blue I can smell like winter plums. [91]
The blue leads to the amphitheater hollow where the stage once opened to the sky, and to him. [109]
The encore-seeking stage ghost bows on the mossy boards, a gentleman of curtains and dust with eyes lit by recollection. [129]
He knows me now, because I always come when the last register beep fades and the lobby perfume stops arguing with the past. [152]
We are both caretakers, in a way, of a fractured timeline that keeps breaking on the rim of applause. [171]
He tells me the present is a house left slightly ajar, and the wind of other nights keeps entering. [190]
I tell him the coin sings when I hold it flat to the orchard and ask for direction. [208]
Its hand-painted starlight flares citrus and brass, and a whisper gathers on the boards like silk. [224]
We always begin by producing echoes, gentle duplicates of words and steps, until the orchard answers with its own remembered footnotes. [245]
The echoes intertwine with the wind, and the path through the hedge rearranges into passages the ghost once played. [264]
I smell green cymbals and hear gold leaves, a choreography my bones recognize somehow from auditions I never attended. [283]
Nostalgia rises like stage smoke, not just his, but the town's, the orchard's, my own forgotten opening nights. [301]
When the maze allows, the garden reveals its lantern fruit, apples bright as cues, pears humming in the prop loft of branches. [323]
The ghost reaches for nothing, and nothing takes his hand, shaping the absence of fingers in the light. [341]
He does this to lure possibility from the brink of despair, because despair makes no encore worth giving. [359]
I am his cashier and conductor, counting rhythms, opening doors, letting the orchard tally what might return. [376]
Sometimes the timeline fractures visibly, a crack across the air where another night falls through like confetti. [393]
A chorus threads past us in silver coats, then vanishes, leaving the scent of lacquer and a chord that tastes of oranges. [415]
The ghost turns, genteel panic in his voice, and asks me to anchor the Star before it spills away. [434]
I press the coin between my palms and listen as blue becomes a bell I can carry, heavy but clear. [454]
Then I speak the old marquee letters, names fallen from the town's tongue, and we braid them into the wind. [474]
The orchard leans closer, boughs creaking like velvet curtains, and a door of leaves opens onto the stage that was. [494]
We step through, and the fractured timeline shivers, not breaking, but learning our rhythm as we sweep the empty seats. [514]
I smell silver dust, hear burgundy in the rafters, and remember my mother's hands counting tips beside these very aisles. [534]
The ghost smiles, a little jealous, a little grateful, because memory fills him even as it releases him. [552]
The coin cools, and the blue bell fades to a thread we will follow tomorrow when the store shuts again. [572]
For now we let the echoes finish, bowing to the orchard as pears applaud softly from their lantern hinges. [591]
Nostalgia swells brighter, simple and kind, like a house light rising to guide everyone gently out. [607]
He thanks me without speaking, and the hedges breathe, shifting back toward their ordinary labyrinth of thorns and receipts. [626]
I walk the long aisle of rustling leaves, my pockets the color of brass, my heart the sound of home. [646]
Behind me, the stage ghost rehearses a last bow for tomorrow, promising to return only if we can finish letting go together. [668]
Ahead, the storefront waits, its quiet neon ready to hum again when I turn the keys and open what morning remains. [689]</story>
