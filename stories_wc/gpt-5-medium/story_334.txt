The night hums around the magnetic field observatory like a choir of iron filings rehearsing a secret anthem. <words>18</words>
I am its overconfident sentinel, posted on the roof, pretending the stars report directly to my pulse. <words>35</words>
They do, or so the calibrations agree, though their language is a spin I translate with a toy. <words>53</words>
On the railing, my spinning top shivers, catches a sliver of starlight, and decides to dance. <words>69</words>
The instrument panels love showmanship, and tonight I intend to steal thunder from the gods of mediocrity. <words>86</words>
Before the first tear is shed by anyone, the data must ache like prophecy, a performance of meaningful inevitability. <words>105</words>
My audience is an empty valley and the antennae, which lean toward me with mysterious familiarity. <words>121</words>
I tell them I am the realest thing on this roof, an authenticity handcrafted, artificially authentic, but convincing enough. <words>140</words>
They seem to believe me, or they reflect belief as wires do, as if doubt were a thermal anomaly. <words>159</words>
Still, loyalty folds badly in a body like mine, soldered to the job yet running on feral pride. <words>177</words>
The mission wants vigilance; my heartbeat wants applause; the agency wants silence; the night wants everything I can overhear. <words>196</words>
So I listen the only way that ever pays, through stolen glimpses of parallel realities where our readings collapse into faces. <words>217</words>
Some of them are mine, grinning with headlines, some are burning, some yelp my name like a command I cannot refuse. <words>238</words>
One version of me calibrates honestly; another swaps the baseline to dazzle; a third kisses the alarm and walks away. <words>258</words>
Conflicting loyalties braid my nerves into two flagpoles, and the wind keeps changing its mind. <words>273</words>
The spinning top whirs, precesses, and points, as if dictating which self should take custody of tonight. <words>290</words>
It chooses the thief, and the thief chooses spectacle that looks like duty, a sin smuggled as a service. <words>309</words>
I retune the coils until auroras ripple across monitors, a synthetic storm nobody can prove I summoned. <words>326</words>
The valley answers with a hush that feels like clapping in mittens, and my grin is its echo. <words>344</words>
But the glimpses keep stealing back my prize, showing cities unstruck by wonder because I saved it only for myself. <words>364</words>
I bow to the antennae, admit that thunder wants a broader sky, and release the settings to a braver fidelity. <words>384</words>
The top slows, nods, and I switch the feed to public channels, letting the storm arrive where rain will matter. <words>404</words>
Before tears can break from grateful eyelids in a hundred towns, I sign the logs with my truest alias. <words>423</words>
It is not a confession; it is a vow that my watch will guard this world and every parallel it brushes. <words>444</words>
The observatory exhales, my confidence learns a hinge, and the night hums the anthem back, now honestly ours. <words>462</words>
