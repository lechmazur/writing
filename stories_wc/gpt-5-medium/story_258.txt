<story>The orchard afloat on a circle of driftwood in open seas rocks like a cradle cracked by tides. <words>18</words>
I am its nimble locksmith, tasked with keeping trunks and hearts shut until they need to open. <words>35</words>
The trees bear locks instead of fruit, and my tools are stories with tumblers worn by listening. <words>52</words>
Most nights taste of jaded wonder, salt, and the hushed gossip of gulls circling the improbable grove. <words>69</words>
I learned this craft via dusty yearbooks with questionable annotations, margins whispering combinations and dances scribbled like tidal marks. <words>88</words>
Their pages mapped ceremonies our elders forbade us to forget, so I catalogued every step to preserve indigenous dances. <words>107</words>
I unlocked rhythms from hull seams and from wind knots, and sometimes I prance alone among ladders of moonlight. <words>126</words>
People think I am physically metaphysical, hands gritty with resin yet nimble around the hinge between memory and marrow. <words>145</words>
Today a torn map corner lodges under my tongue, a paper splinter pointing toward a storm of secrets. <words>163</words>
The omen matches our rule: when the final leaf drops from the ancient oak, the ocean starts remembering inconvenient truths. <words>183</words>
It is almost time, because that last leaf twitches like a trapped fish, and every lock clicks in its sleep. <words>203</words>
I oil my picks, then feed the map sliver to the soil, which drinks directions and burps up coordinates. <words>222</words>
The grove pivots, driftwood creaking, steering us toward an archipelago whose elders bartered vowels for rain and kept the dances breathing. <words>243</words>
I hand the crew yearbooks stained with seawater, directing them to annotations that say which root to knock and which sky to hum. <words>266</words>
We practice under lanterns while squalls prowl, and even my jaded wonder warms when the footwork turns waves into patient listeners. <words>287</words>
But the storm of secrets arrives demanding tribute, hurling back old doors I had sealed over ruined holidays, mocking our borrowed grace. <words>309</words>
The final leaf finally falls, and all around us the locks sprout tongues, confessing names of dances lost to bargain and exile. <words>331</words>
I kneel in the orchard, pricking fingers on brass blossoms, and vow to preserve indigenous dances by founding a school aboard this raft. <words>354</words>
Tuition will be stories, paid in footsteps, and the entrance exam will require unlocking your breath with the little pick of grief. <words>376</words>
Even the gulls consent to teach, one demonstrating a coastal shuffle, another a high prance that braids wind into a sash. <words>397</words>
At dusk I unlock the horizon, and what spills out is not gold, but elders arriving in boats carved from vowels. <words>418</words>
Together we set the oak to dancing, and the storm, satisfied, quiets, letting our orchard drift toward tomorrow like a kept promise. <words>440</words>
