I am a weathered poet climbing the mountaintop to find what my lungs keep losing. <words>15</words>
Around me, a blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests shivers in cloudlight, pruning the sky into tiny green cathedrals. <words>33</words>
The monastery cafe has no power, so the barista heats water by breath and prayer during power outages. <words>51</words>
On the counter, confessional cups pile up, their sleeves scribbled with runes, apologies, and coordinates. <words>66</words>
I was invited here by reading confessions on coffee cup sleeves, a scavenger trail of ink and tremble. <words>84</words>
Each line promised an invitation to breathe, if I could translate the smudges without losing their storms. <words>101</words>
My motive is plain as pine bark: to map sacred flows through a world that keeps damming itself. <words>119</words>
The bonsai are ideally messy, branches trained to ache toward miniature thunder, roots masquerading as braided rivers. <words>136</words>
I feel a joyful dread while stepping between their plots, afraid the map will change me, thrilled that it must. <words>156</words>
A novice presses into my hand an unmarked makeup compact, saying the saints used it as a mirror for storms. <words>176</words>
I open the compact and see not my face but a cloud-ringed mouth, opening and closing like a bellows. <words>195</words>
It fogs the glass, scrawling a map only when I grasp it lightly, as if it were a moth with directions. <words>216</words>
The novice reads a sleeve aloud, the ink quavering into wind: bury your rage beneath the cedar that remembers tidal sleep. <words>237</words>
We follow the bonsai corridors, each corner a turning of lungs, each root a syllable the mountain keeps repeating. <words>256</words>
When the last generator coughs dead, the cafe spills its candles into the maze, and shadows bloom with a patient hiss. <words>277</words>
Night plugs the sockets of birds, and still the compact breathes, exhaling a trail that braids hunger with hush. <words>296</words>
I sketch what the mirror exhales, lines that refuse tidy righteousness, a cartography of mistakes that wants to be followed. <words>316</words>
People begin arriving, leaving more sleeves, admitting their secret floods, letting their pulses be read like rivers without shame. <words>335</words>
I mark on bark where each confession bends the weather, and the bonsai lean with such listening that thunder forgets to strike. <words>357</words>
At the labyrinth heart, the compact closes itself, clicking like a seed, and the path exhales as though unclenching. <words>376</words>
We stand there, strangers and siblings, and the air issues an invitation to breathe that feels older than snowfall. <words>395</words>
Joyful dread rinses my heart, a tide that erases the neat arrows and leaves only currents wanting names. <words>413</words>
I gift the compact to the wind, ask the forest to carry it, and promise to return when the outages teach patience again. <words>436</words>
Until then, I keep climbing, ideally messy, recording sacred flows on my skin so no switch can exile their light. <words>456</words>
And everything we learned hums on a mountaintop long after the lights return. <words>469</words>
