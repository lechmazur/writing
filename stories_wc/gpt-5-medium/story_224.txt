<story>The lingering minstrel arrived late to the giant's dining room, amid rush hour that thundered outside like impatient weather. <words>19</words>
He had come to escape a mundane existence, though every doorway in that house could swallow a cathedral without effort. <words>39</words>
The host, a gentle giantess with wrists like bridge cables, spoke softly, as if her voice might misplace nearby valleys. <words>59</words>
Beside her soup tureen lay a witch's gnarled wooden ladle, blackened and pitted like a small, loyal moon. <words>77</words>
The minstrel, openly private in the way of travelers who tell truths slant, hovered near that utensil as though near a shrine. <words>99</words>
He had heard the ladle could rejuvenate a soul via the texture of a meteorite's surface, if one listened hard enough. <words>120</words>
Not to music, as he had always done, but to the hush that remained after words collapsed under their own weight. <words>141</words>
His songs kept crowds, yet his life kept circling the same unlit fountain, and gentle turmoil had become regular weather. <words>161</words>
The giantess bid him climb the spoon's handle, a ramp of scars and star-craters, and he set his palms upon it. <words>182</words>
Its coolness held a flavor of winter nights; its ridges spoke histories of falling and surviving in languages of grit. <words>202</words>
He pressed his ear to the meteor-pitted grain, and the dining room, though crowded by giants and aromas, went still. <words>222</words>
Outside, rush hour raged, boots like avalanches, horns like startled geese; inside, a silence arrived that felt deliberately carved. <words>241</words>
He sang nothing, and the giantess nodded, affirmed by silence, the old covenant between listeners who let sound breathe without fences. <words>262</words>
In that pause, he remembered roads, inns, and coins like tin applause, and decided remembrance alone could no longer pay his fare. <words>284</words>
The ladle's meteor skin rasped his fingertips, and his calluses mapped constellations he had played blind for years. <words>302</words>
Each ridge told him to pour, not from throat to air, but from memory to marrow, where quiet could plant a forest. <words>324</words>
So he lifted the witch's gnarled wooden ladle and drew a single circle through the soup, seasoning absence with meteor dusk. <words>345</words>
Steam rose, tasting of iron rain, and his heart found a backdoor out of the ordinary, slow as moss yet certain. <words>366</words>
He asked the giantess nothing, because questions would only bruise the moment; her smile told him to keep traveling inward. <words>386</words>
There, newly tuned, the lingering minstrel felt his life rejuvenate, via the texture of a meteorite's surface, into an openly private vow. <words>408</words></story>
