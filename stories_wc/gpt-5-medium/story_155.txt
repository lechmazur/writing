I arrived at the broken planetarium, reimagined as a night club, with my helmet tucked under an arm that never forgets pressure. <words>22</words>
As an underwater welder, I always read rooms like currents, testing eddies of light and sound for hidden scaffolds. <words>41</words>
Tonight was the crossing where two timelines should never meet, though the bouncers stamped wrists as if it were ordinary tide. <words>62</words>
I came to wield improbable power, and the star-scarred ceiling promised it with every flicker stitched among turned off constellations. <words>82</words>
I am patiently impatient, trained by tides to wait for the right second and to pounce before metal remembers its flaws. <words>103</words>
On the bar sat a vintage button box, wood rubbed smooth by unknown thumbs, its dozen colors whispering choices no bartender could pour. <words>126</words>
I had traced it here via glimpses in vintage store mirrors, where my reflection wore futures like wet suits abandoned in tidepools. <words>148</words>
The mirrors told me to pamper the night, to polish my doubts like scratched visors until the stars showed through again. <words>169</words>
My grandmother left me the habit of listening to dead light, an inherited mystery humming whenever power clung to emptiness. <words>189</words>
The DJ, dressed like a lighthouse keeper, winked and said the box belonged to whoever could weld a seam between yesterdays. <words>210</words>
I set my torch kit on the booth, feeling the planetarium shiver as if a whale had brushed the wall of space. <words>232</words>
Moments of unraveling braided themselves across the dance floor; couples forgot steps, stories unraveled, and the ceiling map began to peel. <words>253</words>
I pressed the blue button, and a tide of oxygen memory rushed over me, smelling of tin wrecks and the first cut through rust. <words>277</words>
Then I pressed the red, and saw a second me drinking alone tomorrow, smoothing calluses as if time were a sheet of copper. <words>300</words>
The music slowed to a pulse that matched my helmet's regulator, and the two versions of me stepped toward the crossing. <words>321</words>
I was patiently impatient enough to negotiate with myself, promising to share breath if we could weld the seam without drowning. <words>342</words>
Together we opened the button box, not with force but with care, the way divers pamper valves before a deep descent. <words>363</words>
Inside lay a coil of starlight wire and a mirror shard, humming instructions: stitch the now to the almost, and wield improbable currents. <words>386</words>
I angled the shard to catch the vintage store mirrors hidden behind the bar, using their glimpses to align the seam across our chests. <words>410</words>
When the starlight wire sizzled, the planetarium night club turned inside out, and our timelines met without breaking, a weld bright as whalesong. <words>433</words>
I felt the improbable power settle like a crown of compressed air, demanding a tax of vigilance and stories kept unspoken. <words>454</words>
The unraveling paused, and I walked the floor as guardian, patiently impatient, heir to mystery, welding whispers to stars until morning. <words>475</words>
