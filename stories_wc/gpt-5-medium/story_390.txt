In the ancient Chinese palace, a calm assassin waited in a garden that smelled like ink and magnolia scrolls. <words>19</words>
He specialized in being figuratively literal, taking metaphors seriously enough to fold them into maps and snack plans. <words>37</words>
Tonight, his mission had the flavor of tea leaves and TED talks, which is to say, oracular yet caffeinated. <words>56</words>
He was hired to spin a prophecy into raw possibility, preferably without blood, and ideally with historical panache. <words>74</words>
Before the first question is asked, the future listens for footnotes, he reminded himself, smoothing his gloves against the night. <words>94</words>
In his satchel rested a botanical press, its hinges older than gossip and twice as determined to straighten things out. <words>114</words>
Between its wooden cheeks he kept leaves from the imperial osmanthus, each veined like quiet maps of escape. <words>132</words>
He planned to amalgamate these leaves into a butterfly, then read the palace fate by the pattern of a butterfly's wings. <words>153</words>
Ridiculous, yes, but court politics enjoyed ridiculous methods as long as they arrived on time and bowed correctly. <words>171</words>
Whispers of longing drifted along the lacquered corridors, a rumor that the Empress desired a future with fewer assassins and more poems. <words>193</words>
He nodded at the sentiment, as one nods at weather before deciding whether the umbrella is mark of prudence or surrender. <words>214</words>
The palace drums thumped like patient hearts, and the moon hung above as if the sky had paused mid inkstroke. <words>234</words>
From a pavilion, scholars argued about auspicious geometry, balancing compasses on noodles and declaring noodles uncooperative emperors. <words>251</words>
He slipped by, calm as extra punctuation, and entered the Jade Archive where prophecies slept with moths and meticulous dust. <words>271</words>
There, he arranged the pressed leaves into a winged diagram, letting each green shard answer a question not yet asked. <words>291</words>
The pattern revealed a corridor, a pause, a servant with a tray, and a joke about peaches that could save a dynasty. <words>313</words>
He laughed softly, a polite hazard, because comedy in palaces works like incense: delightful, until someone coughs policy. <words>331</words>
His motivation felt clear: nudge events sideways so the prophecy could loosen, unwind, and spin again as raw possibility. <words>350</words>
He would escort the Empress onto that corridor, delay the tray, trigger the peach joke, and let destiny trip politely. <words>370</words>
Assassination, he decided, was simply editing with consequences; being calm just meant crisply underlining the punchline. <words>386</words>
Still, whispers of longing scratched inside him, a personal footnote daring him to want something that did not wear silk. <words>406</words>
He wanted, inconveniently, to retire to a tiny shop where he could press leaves, bind recipes, and curate laughter safely. <words>426</words>
But first he must escort, delay, trigger, because the pattern was persuasive in the way lightning is persuasive to tall trees. <words>447</words>
When the Empress arrived, he bowed exactly as a comma bows to a clause, and she chuckled despite the hour. <words>467</words>
Before the first question is asked, he murmured, listen to how the future clears its throat and pretends it was singing. <words>488</words>
History winked; he slipped away, already pricing shop rent in dreams. <words>499</words>
