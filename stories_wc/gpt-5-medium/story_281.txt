<story>Between appointments, I ducked into the haunted lighthouse engine room to wait out the rain and count my accidental spoils. <words>20</words>
I am a baffled pickpocket, baffled mostly by how money keeps choosing me when I keep choosing escape. <words>38</words>
The engine coughed, the sea hissed, and from a crate emerged an eerie ventriloquist dummy with barnacled cheeks and velvet elbows. <words>59</words>
It sat like an accusation and winked with confusingly lucid timing, as if my heartbeat were a laugh track. <words>78</words>
I answered with scorching poise I only pretend to own, the kind you rehearse while casing saints and safes. <words>97</words>
The dummy opened its painted mouth and asked whether I believed in the art of transformation or only its polished receipts. <words>118</words>
I said my fingers practiced one art, but my hunger practiced another, and both were engines I could barely sustain. <words>138</words>
It tilted its head, gears under the floor shuddering, and invited me to challenge the status quo by speaking instead of stealing. <words>160</words>
It proposed we hold court through impromptu poetry sessions, the pistons tapping meter, the lantern swinging like a metronome. <words>179</words>
Between the machinery and the tide, I found words pickpockets rarely carry: apologies, treaties, futures. <words>194</words>
I spoke of my mother, who stitched false pockets into our grief, and the dummy recited my pauses back to me. <words>215</words>
Its ventriloquism was confusingly lucid, the voice arriving from everywhere at once, like fog that had read philosophy. <words>233</words>
It claimed the lighthouse had been built to warn ships, then condemned to warn souls, then forgotten to warn the ambitious like me. <words>256</words>
The engine room scraped another tone, and I delivered a verse about hands learning to return what they had learned to take. <words>278</words>
I promised the harbor to become less thief than threshold, to transform how hunger behaves when it stands in a storm. <words>299</words>
The dummy clapped, its brittle palms striking like matches, and a small fire of understanding signed its name upon my ribs. <words>320</words>
Outside, the lighthouse turned its great eye, but down here we were the beam, and we held that light with scorching poise. <words>342</words>
I asked what price transformation demands, and the dummy said, Only the courage to let your pockets breathe like bellows. <words>362</words>
So we sang new laws to the rusted valves, promising to sustain their rhythm if they sustained our repaired intentions. <words>382</words>
The rain slackened, and the engine room seemed less haunted, or more honestly haunted by choices still breathing. <words>400</words></story>
