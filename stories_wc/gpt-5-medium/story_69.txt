I am an uncertain druid, and mornings in the hologram repair shop feel like fogged glass humming with lethargic excitement. <words>20</words>
On my bench sits a dented lunch tin, its lid jittering whenever a faltering projector sighs near it. <words>38</words>
Business trickles throughout library hours, when the archivists send their wounded apparitions for mending and sip tea while indices dream. <words>58</words>
I tune their ghosts because I long to forge beauty from anarchy, to coax pattern from the buzzing junkyard inside and outside. <words>80</words>
Yet the ties of obligation tug like fishing line from a vanished shore, dragging me sideways whenever I start to feel certain. <words>102</words>
My craft is uniquely common, a blend of street moss and retail warranty that only a city could teach. <words>121</words>
So I wander after lunch, cupping the tin, drifting through back-alley theater auditions where hopefuls rehearse tragedies into dumpsters and skylight puddles. <words>143</words>
There I patch flickering halos for their monologues, trading repairs for stories, letting each patched light teach my plants to speak. <words>164</words>
Inside the dented lunch tin rattle seeds, screws, and a letter from my grandmother reminding me to return the world better than I left it. <words>189</words>
Her handwriting knots into ivy, binding my wrists with promises I made the day I first raised rain from a parking lot. <words>211</words>
Back at the shop, the librarians bring a fractured reading of a forgotten play, its actors replaced by stuttering light that cannot quite remember sorrow. <words>236</words>
I recruit from the auditions, asking the gentlest misfits to stand among the repaired holograms and mimic their pauses until the pauses feel human. <words>260</words>
Lethargic excitement drifts through the stacks as we rehearse, a tide that moves slowly yet refuses to stop, like weeds taking a cathedral. <words>283</words>
I set the seeds beneath the projectors, and when the lamps warm, little stems rise into the holograms and borrow their borrowed faces. <words>306</words>
This makes a chorus uniquely common, a garden of ordinary tongues synchronized with spectral scripts, satisfying the ties of obligation without numbing their ache. <words>330</words>
Throughout library hours patrons drift in, believing they are browsing, yet their shadows sit, listen, and become cast members as the plants and lights converse. <words>355</words>
I wander the aisles with my tin, feeding screws to dying prisms and water to seedlings, and together we forge beauty from anarchy without forcing it. <words>381</words>
The librarians sign the checkout slips like blessings, and my wrists feel looser, not free. <words>396</words>
I am still an uncertain druid, but the city breathes easier, and so do I. <words>411</words>
