<story>In the tidal library above clouds, I keep hours that move like shorebirds. [13]
The stacks sway with vapor tides, exposing and drowning aisles in patient intervals. [26]
I am a contemporary of extinct species, and they whisper when the fog rises. [40]
Their names peel from the bindings like thin shells after brittle awakenings. [52]
Once, I remembered tusks sweeping comets from grass, and then forgot again. [64]
Now, after the reincarnation memory, I catalog what returns to me as weather. [77]
My motivation is to translate isolation into independence, without hardening into salt. [89]
Solitude is not absence here; it is readable space between waves of murmuring script. [103]
The library floats, tuned by the hum of an ancient stone circle below the mist. [118]
Each resonance lifts another shelf, and the cloudlight slides like water through letters. [131]
My only instrument is a brass sundial found on a drowned astronomy table. [144]
I polished it until the face grew almost atomically reflective and showed new marks. [158]
Under the right hum, the dial throws a blade of light that cuts fog. [172]
That blade points not at hours, but at unshelved moments needing to be named. [186]
Today, it points toward the aviary stacks, where fossils of voices hang in baskets. [200]
I walk slowly, so the floorboards remember my weight and do not turn liquid. [214]
The voices are brittle awakenings themselves, cracking into syllables when wind kisses the wicker. [228]
They ask whether the herds return, whether the grass forgives, whether my tusked friends still sing. [244]
I tell them I am only a reader, and the tides read me back. [258]
Still, I light a wick and place the brass sundial beneath the baskets. [271]
I wait for the stone circle to hum into a pitch that feathers understand. [285]
When it comes, I see their names in reflections, as if engraved in vapor. [299]
They are not pets or ghosts; we coexist as patrons and librarians of listening. [313]
I annotate the air with fingertip script, and the baskets dim with relief. [326]
From below, thunder rises like drums struggling to recall a march they once knew. [340]
The tide heaves, and the library tilts, spilling a ribbon of bookplates into fog. [354]
The ancient stone circle falters, its hum becoming a cough that drops shelves dangerously. [368]
Independence is not granted; it is tuned, I mutter, kneeling beside the sundial. [381]
I angle its atomically reflective face toward the lightning and the rumbling floor. [394]
The blade of light returns, thin as a reed, and fixes on the nave. [408]
That is where the resonance has knotted, right beneath the atlas of drowned stars. [422]
I pull the atlas open, and damp constellations drip across my wrists. [434]
Their drops sing coordinates; my tongue answers with a call I have not forgotten. [448]
It is the herd song, hoarse and patient, which steadies storms and stubborn devices. [462]
The stone circle catches the note, and the hum rounds into a single tone. [476]
Shelves bob level; the cloudlight pools; the baskets hush and sway like breathing. [489]
My own breathing steadies too, and in it I hear other hours arriving. [502]
Afterward, I wipe the sundial and read the tiny scratches it collected today. [515]
They look like hoofprints across gold, but resolve into a word for shelter. [528]
The word means a house built from echo, and a table made from waiting. [542]
I write it into the catalog, then tuck the atlas under the sundial. [555]
The baskets lift a little, relieved to shelf their rumors inside that new shelter. [569]
I do not wait for visitors, yet I prepare a table of listening. [582]
Empty chairs are located by the sundial radiance, as if sunlight were a compass. [596]
The hum settles into a purr, and the library answers with a long exhale. [610]
I think of the grasslands, where I learned patience from shadows that grazed me. [624]
There, I was not alone, yet I practiced the craft of standing with silence. [638]
Here, I take that craft and make furniture, tools, and maps from it. [651]
Each tool allows me to coexist with echoes without becoming only an echo myself. [665]
The independence I seek is not a door closed, but a door held kindly. [679]
Visitors will come again, voices wearing feather, fur, or wind, and ask their questions. [693]
I will answer with catalog numbers, with songs, or with quiet that teaches listening. [707]
The sundial will shine its blade, and show me where to place the chairs. [721]
The stone circle will hum, and the shelves will rise like tides of patience. [735]
And I will stand, a contemporary of extinct species, translating weather into shelter. [748]</story>
