On night-shift in the quantum entanglement lab, I practiced miracles with the frankness of a born spiritual con artist.<words>19</words>
My hands were eloquently clumsy, and my patter danced like chalk dust in sunlight, serious playfulness powdered across cold instruments.<words>39</words>
All my power fit under a simple glass jar lid, clouded by fingerprints I never quite wanted to wipe away.<words>59</words>
I hustled experiments and hearts to laugh in the face of the inevitable dawn, because laughter paid when funding would not.<words>80</words>
But the price of truth rose like liquid helium, invisible, expensive, and always escaping the bottles I pretended were full.<words>100</words>
So I built a ritual to sell revelation through reversed moments, rewinding entanglement events until the audience felt time breathe backward.<words>121</words>
Throughout crafting the performance, each reversal cost me a sliver of honest sleep, as if fatigue settled payment in advance.<words>141</words>
The lab was a cathedral of humming racks, and I was its sly acolyte, blessing wires with jokes and contraband prayers.<words>162</words>
I kept the simple glass jar lid pocketed like a talisman, the only ceiling I could carry against collapse.<words>181</words>
When the director arrived with auditors, I welcomed them warmly, then pressed eject on the playback, and time spilled politely.<words>201</words>
Cables recoiled into coils, coffee leapt back into cups, and equations un-wrote themselves as our laughter hopped toward its causes.<words>221</words>
I choreographed my eloquently clumsy stumbles so the auditors believed even the errors were entangled, that fate itself apologized for tripping me.<words>243</words>
They wanted certainty; I sold amazement, carefully avoiding the receipt that listed the price of truth beside my name.<words>262</words>
But when the core qubits hiccuped, the room tilted, and I reached for the jar lid as though it were a moon.<words>284</words>
I polished it on my sleeve, a mirror small enough to forgive, and angled my face into it for renegotiation.<words>304</words>
Through reversed moments I watched myself steal credibility, then watched myself offer it back, coin by coin, into the waiting room of dawn.<words>327</words>
I realized the show had to pay in full, not with laughter, but by admitting the lie was a method and the truth the act.<words>352</words>
So I told them, with serious playfulness intact, that the machine worked best when confession set the baseline noise to human.<words>373</words>
I slid the jar lid across the bench like currency, a cap removed from emptiness, and declared it my deposit against future miracles.<words>396</words>
The auditors, startled, saw the data align, and I laughed in the face of the inevitable dawn as my persona ejected itself.<words>418</words>
It cost me the gig, perhaps, but the price of truth finally cleared, and the lab hummed on without my charming counterfeit.<words>440</words>
Throughout crafting new vows to myself, I kept the bench clean and left the jar lid behind, a tiny horizon anyone could afford.<words>463</words>
