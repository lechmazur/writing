In the nano-scale city, I wake during the hours between remorse and forgiveness, gears grinding with ruminative exasperation. <words>18</words>
I am a curious tinkerer who once broke more than I built, and my rival still wears the scars. <words>37</words>
Today I intend to make amends with that enemy, though even my tools distrust the notion. <words>53</words>
On the bench waits a plague doctor's beaked mask, scaled for a citizen the size of a dust mote. <words>72</words>
I built it to filter the pathogen of blame from our airways, a gesture bolder than an apology. <words>90</words>
But amends require hopeful excavations, digging through layered grievances without collapsing the streets above. <words>104</words>
Our avenues braid between polymer tenements, and the subway is a tremor traveling the length of a motile cilium. <words>123</words>
Between those hours, every ticking actuator sounds like a jury. <words>133</words>
So I wire my contrition via interconnected wishes, a lattice of intentions soldered through the city like nerves. <words>151</words>
The plan is suspiciously straightforward, and that alarms me more than any impossible architecture ever has. <words>167</words>
I will reforge the broken memory that keeps my enemy poised like a blade at my throat. <words>184</words>
Her name is Quen, and she believed me when I promised to isolate a fever we both had ignited. <words>203</words>
My apparatus vented into the aqueduct, shrinking half the ward and forcing them to migrate into the lungs. <words>221</words>
Quen donned the plague doctor's beaked mask, not for theater, but to walk the wasted corridors I had authored. <words>240</words>
I invite her beneath the struts, where the city rustles like shellfish and my nerves practice failing. <words>257</words>
I show her a blueprint whose arrows simply point inward, into the sediment of our shared negligence. <words>274</words>
We will tunnel through recollections, performing hopeful excavations until we reach the moment the harm first brightened. <words>291</words>
Each passage opens via interconnected wishes, their circuits accepting only sincerity, because alloys of pretense corrode instantly. <words>308</words>
I dislike how tidy that sounds, and my ruminative exasperation grinds louder as if to warn us. <words>325</words>
Quen says it seems suspiciously straightforward only because we already survived the labyrinth that earned our map. <words>342</words>
We descend into capillary alleys where traffic pulses red and blue, and memories flake like paint from cartilage walls. <words>361</words>
At the core we find an overconfident sketch, my signature beside hers, the valves sketched wrong by one stroke. <words>380</words>
Together we reforge the lines, reallocating flow so the city drinks without drowning, and the ward regains breadth. <words>398</words>
Quen removes the beaked mask and the city inhales, its nano-scale choir exhaling verdicts softer than dust. <words>415</words>
Between remorse and forgiveness, our interconnected wishes hold, and my enemy becomes my witness, which is almost the same as peace. <words>436</words>
