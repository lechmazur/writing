<story>Between tidal changes, the cave mouth opened like a held breath under the cliff. [14]
I waited for the crashing hush to deepen before I slipped inside. [26]
I am a claustrophobic spelunker, guided less by courage than by compulsion. [38]
I track invisible things, which is how I survive small spaces that try to erase me. [54]
Currents slicking my skin, air seams whispering from rock, the magnetic itch of buried wire. [69]
All of it pointed to the forgotten research facility no one admits existed. [82]
I came to Return what I took, and to stand by the unremembered who stayed. [97]
Years ago, before fear and salt made me careful, I stole a speck of light. [112]
A codex margin illuminant gold fleck, flaked from a monastic page and soldered to a sensor board. [129]
They used it to sweeten conductivity in brine, an old trick in a new machine. [144]
I kept the fleck for luck, and the system they built collapsed into rumor. [158]
Now the tide dropped, and I did too, belly against rock, breath rationed. [171]
The entrance squeeze pinched my ribs like a hand I owed money. [183]
Panic hummed, but I counted drips and felt the cold pull of the ocean under the stone. [200]
When the walls narrowed, I pressed my face to granite and measured the air seam with my lips. [218]
Tracking invisible things is a way of believing that the world will notice me back. [233]
The facility door was a rectangle of corroded blue steel the sea could not quite swallow. [249]
Its seals worked through phase transitions, brine freezing where heat skipped and thawing at a whisper. [265]
I palmed the gold fleck, pressed it to a dead contact, and breathed until frost lacquered it delicate. [283]
Ice bridged the broken gap, heat from my mouth turning the boundary into a decision point. [299]
Through phase transitions, the old lock remembered, and the door unlipped with a tired sigh. [314]
Inside, the crashing hush became a constant pressure, the ocean talking through pipes and bolts. [329]
Fluorescents slept overhead like seals; my headlamp cut a narrow lantern down corridors labeled in flaking tape. [346]
This place had once listened to undersea cables, reading fault currents and shipwreck crosstalk as if they were weather. [365]
The team measured the murmurs of continents and mapped them for a war that ended without remembering their names. [384]
I was their intern, unpaid, unseen, good at not being noticed, a perfect ear. [398]
When the funding vanished, the ocean was told to swallow the rest. [410]
But even a bureaucracy leaves crumbs, and I had kept one, a fleck of saintly gold that should have stayed soldered. [431]
I came back between tidal changes, because the narrow road out is only safe in that breathing pause. [449]
And because the machine only wakes when the cables slack and sing low. [462]
I reached the intake room where brine-wet racks tilted like pews. [473]
At the back crouched the terminal, its keyboard yellowed, its RETURN key intact and square as an oath. [491]
I pressed the gold fleck into the sensor slit, a thin communion to close a circuit I had broken. [510]
Then I pressed RETURN, because the program was waiting for a person to come back and finish. [527]
The system coughed, fans stirring salt, and the undersea cables spoke in thermal groans and attic whispers. [544]
Through the thrum a list scrolled, each name a slow light, each duty logged, each last message archived. [562]
I spoke them aloud, one by one, my voice cracking like ice under a foot that trusts too much. [581]
For each, the machine answered with coordinates, depth, and a footnote of failure written in numbers. [597]
They had tracked invisible things, and the world had not noticed them back, but I would stand. [614]
I stood until the list ended, and then I held my breath and waited for one more. [631]
It came as a faint line, a note about a girl who stole a fleck and thought she was nothing. [651]
In the comment field, someone had written: Return when you can bear the room. [665]
I laughed, and it sounded wrong in the crashing hush, but it steadied my hands. [680]
The tide would turn soon, and the tunnel would drown its air; I powered the terminal down. [697]
I took the gold fleck from the slit, hesitated, then set it on the contact pad and left it. [716]
The machine had enough of me and more of them. [726]
I backed out along the corridor, past the pews and the sleeping lights, counting the beats of my pulse. [745]
By the door I felt the chill where ice was knitting again, a seal rebuilding in a patient alphabet. [764]
I breathed once, fogged the seam, and slipped through while solid was still deciding. [778]
Out in the mouth of the cave, the light had changed to evening metal, and the sea took a long breath. [799]</story>
