Inside the forgotten underwater city power station, a sullen farmer named Hale studied corroded switchgear like furrows, waiting for a harvest that electricians had abandoned. <words>25</words>
He had come this deep to walk away from a dead end so final it echoed, chasing work his fields could never offer again. <words>49</words>
His courage felt borrowed, a patchwork valor he stitched from family stories and debts, pretending their steadiness belonged to him long enough to act. <words>73</words>
He unfolded the passed-down quilt from his pack, its mismatched patches mapped with hidden threads, a rickety schematic he trusted more than rusted diagrams. <words>97</words>
Each patch held a pocket, and in each pocket he kept a used postage stamp whose canceled borders whispered routes through pressure and brine. <words>121</words>
He sorted them like little nations yet used them to erase boundaries, pasting their gum across hairline cracks that separated silent rooms from singing conduits. <words>146</words>
His notes were meticulously empirical, yet objectively biased toward hope, because the meter readouts looked like weather, and he understood weather better than fear. <words>170</words>
From a tin lunch, he pulled a brittle lemon grown under lampglass and began to zest its skin, scattering bright oils to dissolve salt fog on contacts. <words>197</words>
During a moment of pure inspiration, he realized the quilt could bridge the generator gaps if he stitched stamp-pockets to copper lugs like orchard grafts. <words>222</words>
He worked with borrowed valor, hands steady as if his grandfather stood behind him, guiding the needle through damp cloth into the humming steel. <words>246</words>
Around him the power station groaned like a whale skeleton, ribbed with conduits and lantern algae, its turbines stalled in prayerful stillness. <words>268</words>
He chose stamps with faces of drowned explorers and uncertain queens, aligning their faded geographies across seams, an atlas transformed into a circuit of mercy. <words>293</words>
As the improvised quilt warmed, the station blinked awake, erasing boundaries between city and ocean, between his ruined farm and this cathedral of pressure. <words>317</words>
Hale watched gauges climb, and he understood he could finally walk away from the dead end that had kept him shorebound, because light meant passageways would open. <words>344</words>
He tuned the flow with farmer patience, terracing voltage, irrigating neighborhoods of glass, his optimism still objectively biased yet anchored by the humming proof. <words>368</words>
He scraped one last twist of lemon over a stubborn relay, inhaled the acrid zest and let it brand his lungs with brightness, a superstition that steadied him. <words>396</words>
The city shuddered, coughed a plume of bubbles, and then the lines thrummed like strings; his stamp collection sang, every canceled mark a letter finally delivered. <words>422</words>
In that lift of current, during a moment of pure inspiration stretching mercifully long, he pictured borders dissolving as waves and fields knit, and turned to leave by newly lit stairs. <words>453</words>
