<story>From the terrace of the ancient Sumerian palace, a sentimental shepherd watches the river darken, as an anchor lifts for a ship's maiden voyage. <words>24</words>
He is habitually spontaneous, yet tonight his impulse is to welcome chaos as a teacher, not to flee it. <words>43</words>
His fingers worry an antique hairpin his mother once wore while counting lambs, a talisman polished by sorrow and pasture dust. <words>64</words>
She hid a set of coordinates along its slender spine, scratched in tiny numbers that only moonlight and patience could decode. <words>85</words>
They direct him to a secret meeting place beneath the river stairs, where honest scribes whisper over clay like wind in reeds. <words>107</words>
Justice has a price, he knows, for his father once sold half the flock after the vizier would boast of taxes and take double. <words>131</words>
Tonight the shepherd brings proof, and humility, and a plan that might invite storms before it calms the plain. <words>150</words>
As drums echo the lifting anchor, he slips through cedar doors, feeling the palace breathe in hushed, grain-scented tremors. <words>169</words>
Chaos is a hard tutor, he reminds himself, and bows to it like a lamb nudging an unpredictable gate. <words>188</words>
Under the stairs the scribes wait, palms inked, eyes shining; they pass him a tablet naming bribes, shipments, and silenced shepherds. <words>209</words>
He adds the hairpin, its numbers confirming the hidden dock and the hour, coordinates matched to stars and canal stones. <words>229</words>
When the court gathers to salute the maiden voyage, he walks forward, sheepish, and asks permission to speak as dust glitters like prayer. <words>252</words>
I am only a shepherd, he says, but I have counted more than lambs, and the tally shames our overflowing granaries. <words>273</words>
The vizier, lacquered with oil and self-regard, tries to boast the room into forgetting, lifting his cup and laughing about provincial ignorance. <words>295</words>
Then the tablet speaks, and the coordinates sing true, and the hairpin flashes like a crescent, sign of the queen's first midwife. <words>317</words>
Guards surge, not sure which way justice points, and the shepherd steps between swords, habitually spontaneous, knees shaking but voice clear. <words>338</words>
I do not ask for punishment, he says, only the price of justice paid in truth, restitution, and new counting done in daylight. <words>361</words>
The court sways like reeds in sudden flood, and chaos enters, keening, but the shepherd bows and calls it teacher, and waits. <words>383</words>
By decree, the vizier returns the grain, the river stairs reopen to common feet, and the shepherd surrenders half his flock to rebuild. <words>406</words>
He accepts the cost as a gate fee to wisdom, turning toward the docks where the anchor still lifts inside his pounding heart. <words>429</words>
Carrying the tablet and the hairpin, he follows the coordinates once more, to a new secret meeting place: the ship's uncertain horizon. <words>451</words>
Chaos boards beside him like a stern friend, and with chaotic humility he smiles, trusting the voyage to finish what justice began. <words>473</words>
