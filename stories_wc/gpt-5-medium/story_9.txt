I read futures the hard way, by reading the water rings on a battered wooden bar top, which is glamorous if you adore humidity and splinters. <words>26</words>
Business is brisk in the maze of billboards that passes for a neon-lit desert, especially here between lost years, when people misplace both hope and receipts. <words>52</words>
I am a mildly panicked soothsayer with a pocket puzzle box with 13 locks, which is as comforting as a calendar printed on smoke. <words>76</words>
My stated motivation, to shape destiny with bare hands, keeps getting caught on things like facts, consequences, and the sudden absence of potable kindness. <words>100</words>
Tonight a drought-bitten mayor asked me how to magnify the last puddle into a river, because his town survives on thirst sold wholesale by luminous advertisements. <words>126</words>
I told him to shut up long enough for the rings to speak, and the bar top hissed like a lecture boiling through a tin whistle. <words>152</words>
The message, translated from ripple to riddle, said the puzzle box held keys for thirteen billboards, each lock a promise of probably unlikely mercy for the land. <words>179</words>
The mayor grinned like a coupon and asked if mercy could be monetized before dawn, which is always the trick with mercy and mayors. <words>203</words>
My hands trembled, mildly, because panic here is a condiment, while I coaxed the pocket puzzle box with 13 locks to remember the codes we lost between lost years. <words>232</words>
Each click released a map to a billboard, and each map demanded we climb steel ribs and twist the current from spectacle toward shelter. <words>256</words>
We stepped into the neon-lit desert where the maze of billboards made the stars feel counterfeit, and the sand complained about paying rent to shadows. <words>281</words>
I followed the water rings' instructions, rehinging panels to harvest night wind, then tilting glare into condensers that magnify dew until it remembers being rain. <words>306</words>
The mayor muttered that this was probably unlikely to impress investors, and I congratulated him for finally achieving accuracy, a talent he'd kept in escrow. <words>331</words>
I kept twisting bolts with my bare hands, because to shape destiny with bare hands you must accept blood as thread and calluses as needlework. <words>356</words>
By the seventh lock, the billboards exhaled enough captured fog that lizards held committee, and a coyote filed a noise complaint against the moon. <words>380</words>
By dawn's bruise, all thirteen locks had spoken, the ads now lecturing about environmental stewardship, and the mayor signed a charter with ink that smelled like rain. <words>407</words>
Between lost years, the town remembered water has no slogan, and my panic receded to a tasteful shimmer, which, believe me, is the height of professionalism. <words>433</words>
I tucked the puzzle box back into my pocket, the maze of billboards humming like tempered bees, and asked if anyone else needed something impossible done responsibly. <words>460</words>
