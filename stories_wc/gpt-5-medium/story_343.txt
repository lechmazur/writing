In the steampunk submarine interior, a melancholy jester polished brass smiles that refused to reflect back, while new crimson stencils dried along the bulkheads. <words>24</words>
The crew had ordered quiet, because the captain wanted no dust to settle on the paint during paint drying, yet tensions rattled louder than the valves. <words>50</words>
I, mask tilted and bells wrapped in cloth, carried a crumpled drawing of an altar pattern the sea had nearly eaten. <words>71</words>
It mapped forgotten rites we had sworn to remember, and my motive, however ridiculous, was to restore sacred practices before our journey reached the trenches. <words>96</words>
The officers and stokers would not speak, split by old loyalties and new hunger, needing finding common ground more than coal or air. <words>119</words>
I was iconically unintentional, a jester famous for mishaps that turned suddenly exact, so they tolerated me like a squeaky hinge no one replaces. <words>143</words>
The kettle hissed beside the gauge cluster, and I brewed leaves in a dented cup, inviting both factions to watch a foolish ritual unfold. <words>167</words>
I told them the submarine herself demanded a command, and we would discover which, by analyzing the geometry of tea leaves along the spinning saucer. <words>192</words>
I set the saucer turning on a bolt head, while the room smelled of wet pigment and engines, while the paint took its patient breath. <words>217</words>
Patterns emerged, arcs nested into triangles, triangles into shoal shapes, a grammar the old temples taught for steering hearts when compasses lost their north. <words>241</words>
I read them aloud as jokes, but each punchline bent into counsel, and their laughter, reluctant, softened like lacquer under a low lamp. <words>264</words>
The leaves declared two truths: the stokers guarded the engine heat like a shrine, and the officers guarded charts that remembered every drowned name. <words>288</words>
If each would share, the geometry showed, the ship would stop grinding herself apart, and the sacred would return, not as property, but as practice. <words>313</words>
I unrolled the crumpled drawing across a warm pipe, aligning the altar pattern with rivet constellations, and asked them to place their hands where symbols met. <words>339</words>
Belts clinked, sleeves stained, and then a single officer removed his gloves, touching the soot prints, granting permission without pride, a command more binding than rank. <words>365</words>
A stoker mirrored him, eyes wet from steam, and between them drifted crooked hope, a little ridiculous, yet sturdy as a gasket that finally seats. <words>390</words>
As the paint finished drying, the submarine hummed approval, and we promised to keep rites living through shared labor. <words>409</words>
I bowed, iconically unintentional to the last, because our finest jokes had become rituals, and our rituals, common ground. <words>428</words>
