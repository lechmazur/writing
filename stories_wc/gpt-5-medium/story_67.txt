I raise my hand during the final wave from a departing train window, and the whole town shrinks like a coal cooling. <words>22</words>
Behind me, memory keeps better time than the rails, pulling me back to the contraption inventor's attic where we forged our improbable hours. <words>45</words>
He was a jovial blacksmith, precariously confident, his laughter ringing louder than the temper of steel and the nagging doubts that welded themselves to me. <words>70</words>
He said his work was only this: to prove darkness can be tamed without pretending it is light, to teach it manners with sparks. <words>94</words>
From his left ear swung a single earring, a crescent of iron that caught stray embers like a moon catching wayward tides. <words>116</words>
He worked by the motion of a metronome the inventor had built, its pendulum thudding through air as steady as good breath. <words>138</words>
That beat framed the human condition for him, he claimed, a measure where pain and pleasure were just accents in an unending bar. <words>161</words>
I watched with a fervent indifference I had learned from leaving too often, like a kettle that hisses yet refuses to boil. <words>183</words>
He told me to endure, to let the rhythm carry my fear only as far as the anvil and no farther. <words>204</words>
Up there we nursed little machines that mimicked breathing, contraptions that counted raindrops, and a clock that swallowed time when no one watched. <words>227</words>
I was his apprentice in nothing official, just a neighbor who carried coal and questions, while he hammered answers thin enough to bend. <words>250</words>
When the inventor sold blueprints to a distant city, I took the train, thinking progress could purchase what courage never learned to own. <words>273</words>
But as steel wheels droned, I saw his single earring flash in the attic's lamplight, and the metronome kept time beneath my ribs. <words>296</words>
He had been precariously confident, a bridge of jokes spanning a canyon of night, and I had trusted that grin more than maps. <words>319</words>
He once caged smoke inside a glass labyrinth to show me how darkness could be tamed into patterns that guided lost moths home. <words>342</words>
The human condition, he said, was not suffering but structuring, arranging storms into something countable so that hands knew where to rest. <words>364</words>
Now my palm floats outside the window, the town a receding gear, and I wave, promising to return and finish the machines we began. <words>388</words>
I count the telephone poles by the motion of a metronome only I can hear, and in that counting I manage, just barely, to endure. <words>413</words>
What leaves me is not him or the attic, but the slack faith that light must arrive first, when in truth darkness learns first to listen. <words>439</words>
So I press my fingers to the glass with fervent indifference, ready to prove darkness can be tamed by keeping pace with its breath. <words>463</words>
