<story>
I am a psychic genealogist imprisoned in the space pirate ship brig, smiling with grave playfulness as the last star fades into morning light. <words>24</words>
They caught me tracing family lines through stolen starlight, a proudly humble craft that offends captains who prefer bloodlines to be rumors. <words>46</words>
In my pocket rattles a pair of dice, one chipped, scavenged from a saloon where destinies are bartered for oxygen. <words>66</words>
I roll them against the bulkhead, listening like a priest in a confessional, asking the cells to confess the puzzle of destiny. <words>88</words>
The pirates think destiny is a lock, but I think it is a braid you lengthen with patience and cut with laughter. <words>110</words>
I learned that trick via diaries left on abandoned bullet trains, where exiles wrote lineage like timetables and sorrow like delays. <words>131</words>
Those inked timetables told me to follow the pirates, because their captain carried a family ache worth mapping. <words>149</words>
He paces outside my bars now, the last star thinning, his boots ticking like metronomes for a requiem he refuses to name. <words>171</words>
He wants me to hush the alarm bells of heartbreak that ring through his crew whenever silence grows too honest. <words>191</words>
I tell him heartbreak is ancestral thunder, rolling down corridors from great-grandmothers who hid their names in cargo. <words>209</words>
He laughs, grave and childlike, then hands me my own dice, which his quartermaster confiscated and polished except the faithful chip. <words>230</words>
Roll their prayer, astrologer of blood, he says, pretending not to tremble. <words>242</words>
I am proudly humble, so I bow to the dice like elders and let them tumble, clacking a rhythm that remembers shipwrecked weddings. <words>265</words>
They speak in numbers, and I translate into names, into scars, into the particular baby who was traded for a map of safe currents. <words>289</words>
The captain flinches, because the baby was his grandmother, and the map led to this ship, and the ship grew teeth. <words>310</words>
I propose a bargain delivered with grave playfulness: free me, and I will lengthen your line from curse to chorus before morning completes its trick. <words>335</words>
He unlocks the door, not to save me, but to reach the diaries I carry, copied from those abandoned bullet trains like contraband scripture. <words>359</words>
We read them together when the last star fades into morning light, the brig brightening like a conscience finally telling the whole joke. <words>382</words>
The pages tell us the chipped die belonged to his great-grandfather, who cheated at love and then spent a lifetime paying fair interest. <words>405</words>
So I teach the captain to roll apologies across the floor, to count to two, to choose the harder number, and the bells hush. <words>429</words>
Destiny, I tell him, is a puzzle whose corners are grief and whose center is laughter, and your missing piece is not treasure but listening. <words>454</words>
He frees the crew of their inheritance by naming it aloud, and I walk out proudly humble, dice singing, the brig echoing with grave playfulness. <words>479</words>
