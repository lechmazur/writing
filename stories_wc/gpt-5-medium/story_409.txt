<story>
I wake in the dusty attic filled with clockwork animals, their brass eyelids blinking like patient metronomes. <words>17</words>
My knuckles are purpled, my ribs a slow ache, a bruised fighter pretending victory tastes different than blood. <words>35</words>
Tonight I have come here to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception before it strangles what remains. <words>52</words>
The attic used to be my father's studio, where he taught me to listen at the moment a sculptor's chisel first strikes marble. <words>75</words>
He said truth resonates in that first knock, and everything afterward merely chases its echo. <words>90</words>
On the workbench waits a clay pot shard with an inscription that reads, Stand or be carried by borrowed will. <words>110</words>
The shard was my mother's, a fragment from a vessel we dropped the day she left, saved like a rebuke. <words>130</words>
Its edge kisses my thumb, and I recognize how often I have been skillfully incompetent, rehearsing bravery and performing retreat. <words>150</words>
I have let managers, lovers, and crowds abduct my choices through forgotten dreams they sold as futures. <words>167</words>
Here, among windups shaped like foxes and cranes, I twist a key and listen to small hearts begin ticking. <words>186</words>
The animals circle my feet, mechanical pilgrims, while I whisper to the shard the promise I have avoided. <words>204</words>
If I fight again, it will be for something, standing for something, not standing against the latest noise. <words>222</words>
A tin wolf pauses and raises its snout, as if the room itself considers whether I am worth the oath. <words>242</words>
The old mirror reflects a man I almost recognize, sweat slick, eyes steady, posture neither apology nor threat. <words>260</words>
I place the shard against the mirror, aligning the inscription with my sternum, letting the words press into bone. <words>279</words>
Memories arrive sideways, through forgotten dreams, where my father lifts a mallet and time tightens around the first strike. <words>298</words>
The chisel bites and I understand the pose I avoided carving, hands lowered not from surrender but from resolve. <words>317</words>
I am tired of being carried; I would rather limp under my own banner than sprint behind a sponsor. <words>336</words>
So I breathe until the attic's dust becomes weather, until the clockwork parade slows, until silence risks answering. <words>354</words>
Then I take a marker and write beneath the inscription, I will not outsource my courage, and I mean it. <words>374</words>
The animals still, the mirror stops arguing, and for once the bruises feel like signatures rather than fines. <words>392</words>
Outside, morning readies its first blow, and I raise my face to meet it like uncut stone. <words>409</words>
