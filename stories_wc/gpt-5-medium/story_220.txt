<story>
I was the aloof page of the Harbor Guild, cataloging other people's futures in a ledger that never remembered my name. <words>21</words>
Predictably odd, they called me, a faint ghost in steel corridors, a pair of inked hands that always reached for what glinted where others glanced away. <words>47</words>
Across the lull of a wounded season, ships idled like beasts nursing saltbitten wounds, and the port became a towering labyrinth of shipping containers. <words>71</words>
Our port city breathed in cranes and coughed out sirens, the aisles between containers narrow as grudges, bright with stenciled codes that pretended to be order. <words>97</words>
An unexpected delay leads to a chance meeting, said the old dispatcher's proverb, and the day the cranes froze mid-swing, I believed it. <words>120</words>
I ducked into a shadowy lane to wait out the stoppage and found a woman studying rust like constellations, clutching a deep-sea diver's logbook bound in kelp-stained leather. <words>148</words>
She introduced herself as Serra, retired by pressure and lost depth, and asked if I knew how to read what metal whispers after storms. <words>172</words>
I told her my vocation was to pierce illusions with unstoppable curiosity, even if the illusions wore uniforms and my curiosity was paid minimum wage. <words>197</words>
She opened the logbook, its pages smelling of brine and diesel lullabies, and the diver's careful script described coordinates that rearranged the port like a sliding puzzle. <words>224</words>
Together we traced routes that skipped scheduled manifests, ghost lanes threading containers to secret berths where contraband and vanished wages were laundered into philanthropic rumors. <words>249</words>
If I remained a mere page, Serra said, I would keep copying lies; but if I learned to reconstruct the maze, I might rewrite the margins. <words>275</words>
We walked, predictably odd in our partnership, she tapping bulkheads with a diver's knuckle, I annotating echoes until patterns flowered like bruises facing the sun. <words>300</words>
The logbook's map was innovative nostalgia, a memory of safer depths insisting on new paths above water, and it demanded we reclaim power from the hush. <words>326</words>
Serra guided me to a container painted with a smiling lighthouse, inside of which lay pallets of counterfeit relief supplies tagged as community outreach and guarded by a bored gull. <words>356</words>
We staged our proof like a ceremony, photographing seals, copying serials, and leaving the logbook open where the supervisors would find their reflections swimming in its tide lines. <words>384</words>
By dusk the cranes resumed, but not the old rhythm; murmurs hopped container to container as dockworkers read the pages and my name traveled farther than my posture. <words>412</words>
The Guild pretended surprise, then offered me a promotion to keep the story in-house, but Serra's grin reminded me that belonging was only valuable if chosen. <words>438</words>
So I walked the aisles like a new tide, no longer aloof, a page turning itself, reconstructing the port's narrative until the wounded season found a pulse. <words>465</words>
