I was a sleepy stablehand long before the abandoned carnival ship found me drifting in the foggy bay. <words>18</words>
Its horses were paint and plywood, yet they whickered in the brine like the mares I used to groom. <words>37</words>
I climbed aboard seeking fierce repose, a place to rest and rouse at once. <words>51</words>
The ship had a dusty booth where film clubs once projected reels onto sails, and I kept coming throughout film clubs to sweep their echoes. <words>76</words>
Beauty had to be hunted in unexpected places, my quiet hunger insisted, or else it would drown in the fog. <words>96</words>
I carried a brass magnifier to study paint bubbles, rust whorls, and the tiny worlds imprisoned in carnival mirrors. <words>115</words>
Through it, scratches became constellations, and constellations became invitations to read. <words>126</words>
In a locked trunk I found censored books whose pages were blacked out like tides at new moon. <words>144</words>
I learned to move through reading random lines in censored books, letting severed phrases warp the corridors into corridors of feeling. <words>165</words>
One sentence said the carousel remembers hoofbeats, and my hands smelled of hay again. <words>179</words>
Another said silence is a crowd, and suddenly the drowned bleachers filled with patient listeners. <words>194</words>
They were my dreams in the ruins, shyly unstoppable, arriving with the punctuality of tides and the softness of silt. <words>214</words>
I began writing program notes for no audience, scheduling double features of gulls and gears, velvet and vapor. <words>232</words>
During the matinees I napped in the ticket booth, a sleepy stablehand preserving energy for the night tides. <words>250</words>
At night I read aloud, and the ship answered with unspooled lights combing the fog like groomers. <words>267</words>
The deck would tilt as if remembering a crowd, and the horses leaned toward the hull as toward a trough. <words>287</words>
When the foghorn moaned, I lifted the magnifier and saw not rust but galaxies holding their breath. <words>304</words>
I realized the ship did not haunt the bay; it sheltered it, the way a cupped hand steadies a candle. <words>324</words>
So I promised the water I would keep coming throughout film clubs, curating the tide into a patient cinema. <words>343</words>
My motive was never fame or rescue; it was to find beauty in unexpected places and let it rest ferociously. <words>363</words>
Fierce repose, I learned, is a stable where storms can sleep without losing their thunder. <words>378</words>
The ship became that stable, and I, shyly unstoppable, mucked its memory and brushed its myths until they gleamed. <words>397</words>
On certain nights the films we never screened flickered anyway, sourced from fog, salt, and hoofprint dust. <words>414</words>
I watched them through my brass magnifier and felt the warp of time smooth to a workable calm. <words>432</words>
When dawn finally boarded, it stamped the tickets of gulls, nodded to the horses, and left me sweeping stars. <words>451</words>
It was an abandoned carnival ship drifting in a foggy bay. <words>462</words>
