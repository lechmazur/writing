<story>
The domed vineyard on a barren alien plain hums with recycled wind and a memory of seasons the planet never had. <words>21</words>
I arrive across the hush of a possibility just born, furiously tranquil despite the alarms that solitude always smuggles into breathing. <words>42</words>
I have come to cup starlight in mortal palms, not as a thief, but as a vintner petitioning the cosmos for ripeness. <words>64</words>
The sneering envoy assigned by investors trails me, shoes clicking like hail against the glass walkways, cataloging hopes as liabilities. <words>84</words>
He believes in paper trails more than vines, in signatures more than roots, in futures only if notarized by predictable weather. <words>105</words>
I sift through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse connected to the vineyard like an appendix, searching for a whisper. <words>126</words>
Between cracked planters, a folded note rests under dust, angled toward a beam of solar mimicry like a sun-thirsty moth. <words>146</words>
I open it, expecting inventories, and find instead a cartographer's vow: map the light, coax the void, harvest the hush. <words>166</words>
It reads like rambling destiny, but the script is mine, written years ago when apprenticeship tasted like thunder and ended like salt. <words>188</words>
Back then the envoy was still a rumor in crisp suits, and I was a rumor in soil, confusing patience with surrender. <words>210</words>
Now the dome collects stars like seeds against its curvature, and the barrens outside lie black and echoing, obedient to frostbitten constellations. <words>232</words>
The sneering envoy scoffs at my pause, asking for schedules, for proof of yield, for a ledger that explains why I listen. <words>254</words>
I answer furiously tranquil, stating that silence gathers where fruit might swell, and numbers arrive only after a tongue learns gratitude. <words>275</words>
Our paper trails are not merely invoices; they are the trellised diagrams of light migrating, the receipts of nebulae sold to thirsty nights. <words>298</words>
We sift the air for photons like vintners taste wind, adjusting vents, grafting sensors, braiding algorithms with vines until they hum together. <words>320</words>
Across the hush of a possibility just born, the note becomes a covenant, and I ask the envoy to witness rather than doubt. <words>343</words>
His sneer falters, because even auditors crave origin stories, and the dome smells of beginnings, tart and metallic and almost sweet. <words>364</words>
I cup starlight in mortal palms by tilting the collector bowl, letting cold radiance pool like an unruly vintage, unbottled and honest. <words>386</words>
The folded note becomes our first entry, a seed of paper trails leading outward, not to courts, but to futures fermented in patience. <words>409</words>
Together, furiously tranquil, we annotate the night in longhand, and the sneering envoy signs his name to rambling destiny, finally useful. <words>430</words>
