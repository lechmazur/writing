The factory worker with cosmic powers punched out at midnight and followed the whistle's echo through the silent plant. <words>19</words>
His shift always ended at the end of a corridor no one dares walk, where a rusted door hid the family shrine. <words>41</words>
Out there, a gargoyle-guarded terrace over a bottomless abyss opened to the wind like a page refusing to be closed. <words>61</words>
On its balustrade he set down a plain cameo brooch, the only ornament his family ever kept unremarkable on purpose. <words>81</words>
They said the cameo remembered the weight of every hand that wore it, a ledger, a pulse, a proof. <words>100</words>
Here, a unique family ritual connects generations: to review choices at this brink, each successor speaking aloud the lives they refused, while the sky listened. <words>125</words>
He had been academically wild, a night-school savant who memorized quantum proofs during lunch breaks and mapped constellations on grease-stained napkins. <words>146</words>
Yet the foreman called him Spanner, never Scholar, and the town expected him to keep the machines obedient and his imagination under lock. <words>169</words>
He unclasped the brooch, pressed its cold oval to his sternum, and felt the archived hands of grandmothers and welders and dreamers close around his heart. <words>195</words>
The gargoyles were not statues tonight but auditors, their chipped faces arranged in ordered disarray, stern and sympathetic, balancing terror against possibility. <words>217</words>
He spoke his ledger to them, naming the promotions he had sabotaged, the experiments he had hidden, the constellations he had swallowed like unchewed seeds. <words>242</words>
He confessed the weight that settled when he tried to disregard the footprints left by doubt, and how stubbornly those prints returned each morning. <words>266</words>
Doubt had been the pace car of his life, keeping him obedient to expectations that bent him into a shape the cosmos did not recognize. <words>291</words>
So he reviewed his heritage once more, not as an inventory of debts but as ignition: breaking free from expectations meant honoring the hands, not the chains. <words>318</words>
He lifted his palm, and the cosmic powers he kept sheathed at the factory rose in disciplined swirls, arranging bolts of starlight into blueprints. <words>342</words>
Every unseen promotion, every folded experiment, returned as a lattice of bridges across the abyss, each span labeled with a name he had been afraid to carry. <words>369</words>
He chose the bridge called Scholar-Spanner, a hyphen like a handshake, and stepped where there had been only falling, the gargoyles leaning forward to witness. <words>394</words>
The brooch warmed, and from the cameo's profile a breath escaped, not a ghost but the collective exhale of relatives who had never walked this far. <words>420</words>
Behind him the corridor receded, its fluorescent hum dissolving into sky-thrum, and ahead the terrace stretched, not finished but faithful, a place to build without permission. <words>446</words>
He pinned the plain cameo brooch to the railing for the next pair of trembling hands, smiled, and walked into his new shift, clocking in at dawn. <words>473</words>
