At the haunted amusement park funhouse entrance, I waited with contraband courage, a reckless smuggler chewing on luckless air. <words>19</words>
The outsider group circled like wary gulls, their acceptance the only harbor on this rotting pier of lights. <words>37</words>
To gain acceptance from an outsider group, I had promised a delivery from the other side of fear. <words>55</words>
We stood at the spot where a map tears, dividing known from unknown, the paper frayed like a tired horizon. <words>75</words>
My partner was not here, yet our distant companionship held firm, stitched through radios gone mute. <words>91</words>
We would coordinate via synchronized watch alarms, a chorus of tiny bells to replace words we could not hazard. <words>110</words>
I am rationally emotional, I told myself, counting heartbeats like inventory while wanting to set the sky on fire. <words>129</words>
In my pocket lay a pressed four-leaf clover in glass, brittle luck sealed as evidence against all ghosts. <words>147</words>
The clover belonged to the youngest of them, a girl who believed luck must be trapped before it escapes. <words>166</words>
She had demanded I return it alongside the shipment, or else remain forever outside their drifting firelight. <words>183</words>
I would dramatize every handoff, a reminder to cloak risk in spectacle, because spectacle is currency here. <words>200</words>
The funhouse mouth grinned, mirrors coughing up fog, and the neon sang a jubilant despair that made my teeth ache. <words>220</words>
When the first alarm trilled, I moved, feeling the map inside me tear again, yet I stepped anyway. <words>238</words>
I slid tokens into the turnstile and offered the clover to the ticket boy, who turned out to be a mirror. <words>259</words>
Another alarm rang, and a door opened behind the fanged facade, revealing crates and a breathing velvet darkness. <words>277</words>
In that darkness I felt my partner at a distance, our distant companionship a taut line humming between unseen pylons. <words>297</words>
Third alarm, and the outsider scouts stepped from the funhouse walls, painted like lost constellations, testing whether I would fracture. <words>317</words>
I passed the clover to the girl and raised my empty hands, while my other hands, the ones in fear, kept working. <words>339</words>
From the crates I drew stories, dramatize by motion and breath, describing routes that grazed graves and tides that memorized our names. <words>361</words>
I told them how we smuggled medicine and letters, rationally emotional choices welded from calculations and the heat of loss. <words>381</words>
The girl lifted the pressed four-leaf clover in glass toward the flicker, and every mirror copied hope like graffiti. <words>400</words>
