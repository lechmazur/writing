<story>
The cargo hold of the space pirate ship hummed like a throat clearing secrets it refused to sing.<words>18</words>
Over the clang of chains, the wry caretaker moved with a warmly aloof patience, cataloging stolen futures as if dust.<words>38</words>
An outdated phone lay on a crate, its dial tone a brittle horizon that would soon cut out again, like breath.<words>59</words>
The caretaker palmed a piece of chalk, the only white thing in that iron dusk, and sketched routes on the floor.<words>80</words>
They navigated cargo and memory by tracking cloud paths, copying the curls of nebulae that ghosted outside into narrow chalk spirals.<words>101</words>
Each spiral was a hush against the endless "what if" siren song that battered their skull with shipwrecked futures.<words>120</words>
They wore gentle harshness like a scarf, warm at the neck, chafing enough to keep the heart awake.<words>138</words>
Time here was cargo too, compressed into crates of maybe, expanding when unlatched, a gas that changed anyone who inhaled it.<words>159</words>
When the outdated phone's dial tone finally cut out, the hold fell into a hinge of silence that made choosing possible.<words>180</words>
The caretaker, warmly aloof even toward their own remorse, drew a door in chalk where no door had ever been.<words>200</words>
They smiled wryly at the absurdity, then labeled the door: Exit For Things That Never Happened.<words>216</words>
The ship rolled, pirates laughing somewhere above, the sound like dice in a throat, and the chalk line trembled but held.<words>237</words>
I was hired to polish plunder, they thought, but I became caretaker of causes, waxer of contraband memories and their snarling leashes.<words>259</words>
By tracking cloud paths on metal, they could align the hold with slower eddies of time, giving regrets less current to swim.<words>281</words>
They pressed a palm to the chalk door, counted the breaths since the tone died, and asked the what ifs to vanish.<words>303</words>
The door unlatched like a lid on a jar, and a low corridor of quiet cloud opened, exhaling histories that refused to matter.<words>326</words>
They ushered the ship's smallest stolen things inside, as if tucking children to sleep, so the future could forget how heavy they were.<words>349</words>
Time is not a river, the caretaker thought; it is a harbor with shifting fog, and we mistake fog for tide.<words>370</words>
So they shut the chalk door gently harsh, denying themselves one last look, because softness without edges only delays the healing cut.<words>392</words>
Above, someone called for inventory and laughter answered, but the phone was dead, its dial tone a memory sealed in chalk dust.<words>414</words>
In the pause that followed, the caretaker heard only the mercy of less noise, the "what if" siren song at last distant.<words>436</words>
They stood in the cargo hold, warmly aloof and wry, watching the chalk on steel vanish to smudge, and felt time grow kinder.<words>459</words>
