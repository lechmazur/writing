<story>The marketplace lived inside a giant hourglass, time-worn stalls sifted by patient sand.<words>13</words>
I worked there as a hopeful pickpocket, light-fingered but heavy with overdue honesty.<words>26</words>
Blithe discontent buoyed me like a cracked cork, always floating, never quite ashore.<words>39</words>
I stole trinkets to practice returning them, convinced redemption could be a reversible trick.<words>53</words>
One evening, when chalk lines on the sidewalk fade away outside the glass, business hushed.<words>68</words>
Shadows materialize here then, like tardy customers, and even the sand listens for bargains.<words>82</words>
I lifted a broken pencil sharpener from a poet's coat and felt my ribs ring.<words>97</words>
Inside its cracked tin belly rattled a microcassette labeled, Tastefully Offensive Devotions, Side A.<words>111</words>
I wanted to return it, but the urge to share a secret that sears the soul pulled harder.<words>129</words>
So I found the poet busking under a clockwork awning and proposed a spontaneous karaoke duet.<words>145</words>
His grin said yes, the kind that promises a bruise or a blessing with equal charm.<words>161</words>
We hijacked a stall's tinny speaker, and our gimmick was simple: sing, then confess.<words>175</words>
The marketeers gathered, drawn by novelty and rumors that my jokes were tastefully offensive, never cruel.<words>191</words>
I sang first, a breezy hymn to lost buttons, while the hourglass rained glittering seconds on us.<words>208</words>
Then I clicked the cassette, and our duet swerved into confession, the mic tasting like pennies.<words>224</words>
He harmonized with my words as I admitted I once pocketed my mother's ring to test love's custody.<words>242</words>
The poet answered with a verse from the tape, mapping the depths of devotion like bathymetry for hearts.<words>260</words>
He had carried the sharpener, broken and dear, because its blade once shaved a promise into pencil.<words>277</words>
That promise was to meet me here, nightly, until my courage stopped stalling and finally arrived full-throated.<words>294</words>
My pockets burned; the secret, searing, was that I had taken the ring and pawned my name for another's safety.<words>314</words>
I once traded identities with my sister so a debt collector would chase the wrong ghost.<words>330</words>
The poet, my once-betrothed, had waited among carts and sand, singing to whoever resembled a half-forgotten future.<words>347</words>
He laughed at my patter, called it tastefully offensive therapy, and his eyes dodged like sparrows from a hawk.<words>366</words>
But when we switched to the chorus, the marketplace fell hushed, and truth materialized like a canopy above us.<words>385</words>
He returned the ring by lyrics, word by word, and I returned the sharpener by bowing.<words>401</words>
The crowd clapped, the sand breathed, and my hope finally had somewhere less slippery to stand.<words>417</words>
Outside, where the chalk lines used to teach hopscotch, the evening forgot itself, and so did my guilt.<words>435</words>
We left our duet echoing, because devotion, in its widest depths, is a song that returns what it steals.<words>454</words></story>
