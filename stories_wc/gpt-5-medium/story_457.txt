The nebula observation deck hummed like a cathedral with a broken organ, and I cleaned lint from constellations. <words>18</words>
I am an urban hermit with a side hustle, selling maps of shortcuts nobody believes exist until they walk them. <words>38</words>
My tone is absurd solemnity because reverence sticks better when it looks like gum on the underside of reality. <words>57</words>
Clients leave messages that are impersonally personal, compliments shaped like receipts, apologies signed with astrological doodles and one-eye hieroglyphs. <words>76</words>
They come to this deck seeking prophecy, but the telescope mostly reflects their faces, nebulae staining their doubts lavender. <words>95</words>
I listen across the hush of unspoken promises as if silence were a long corridor with polite doormats. <words>113</words>
My motivation is simple and immodest, to forge new paths that ignore traffic lights yet still wave kindly at pedestrians. <words>133</words>
A broken zipper pull dangles from my jacket like a silver comet, refusing closure while keeping the cold conversational. <words>152</words>
It catches on railings and clients, snagging destinies, and each snag is a signal I must analyze properly. <words>170</words>
I propagate subversive maps through analyzing contradictions in local folklore, because myths argue more honestly than people on deadlines. <words>189</words>
In one tale, the city was born from a spilled thermos; in another, the city is allergic to straight lines. <words>209</words>
I chart the disagreements, then walk their negative space, where stairwells forget which floor they connect and elevators apologize. <words>228</words>
From the deck, the nebula looks like a municipal flowerbed uprooted by cosmic gardeners who read municipal bylaws too literally. <words>248</words>
I tell visitors that conformity is a fog machine, and the stars are only honest when the switch is off. <words>268</words>
They ask if breaking free from conformity is safe, and I say safety is a chair that refuses to be sat on. <words>290</words>
My side hustle thrives because I mark alleys where the pavement giggles, routes where bureaucracy gets dizzy and loses its badge. <words>311</words>
Clients follow, hands in pockets, expecting romance, and meet instead an impersonally personal city that writes them formal love letters. <words>331</words>
We proofread the letters on the observation glass while meteor dust underlines the typos and the horizon offers suspicious citations. <words>351</words>
When doubt arrives dressed as a tour guide, I show it my broken zipper pull and ask it to fasten the night. <words>373</words>
It cannot, so we agree the night should remain ajar, and the deck applauds with a tremor only engineers hear. <words>393</words>
Across the hush of unspoken promises, I release new maps like lantern fish, small heresies that propagate light without permission. <words>413</words>
Each glows with folklore contradictions annotated in pencil, and together they drift toward commuters who did not know they were pilgrims. <words>434</words>
By morning, an alley becomes a corridor to the deck, a corridor becomes a deck, and the city is larger. <words>454</words>
I take my payment in questions I cannot answer, which is the only currency that keeps the stars from getting bored. <words>475</words>
Still, I file receipts, because someone must bow to the absurd, and someone must keep the solemn from becoming smug. <words>495</words>
