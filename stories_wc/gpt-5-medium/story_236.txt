<story>
I file plans under flickering kelp lights, a meek blacksmith misplaced within the underwater city planning office, hammering only with ink. <words>21</words>
My anvil became a desk, my hearth a map table, my iron heat converted to patient drafts and luminous regret. <words>41</words>
Our city floats in a glass lung two trenches deep, where proposals breathe, and secrets remain openly hidden behind municipal language. <words>62</words>
I keep a softcover dictionary beside the drafting slate, swollen with brine, its margins cribbed with currents, dialects, and unpayable debts. <words>83</words>
The entries for bargain, forge, and heartache all refer me back to myself, a joke the ocean tells without smiling. <words>103</words>
I am here to harness heartbreak as fuel, to draft conduits for its heat, and to honor the unfinished bargain. <words>123</words>
Long ago, I promised our first Planner a furnace of grief to shield the living; I delivered blueprints, yet withheld my fire. <words>145</words>
Since then, I verify routes and rumors by verifying half-baked stories from random hitchhikers who drift through the atrium with barnacled suitcases. <words>167</words>
They trade weathered lies for tea, and I test each lie against tidal registries, measuring where sorrow might ignite our failing grid. <words>189</words>
Tonight, across the hush of time's final ripple, a woman shuffles in, carrying a conch that murmurs my name like cooling steel. <words>211</words>
She is a hitchhiker from the drowned highways, and her tale contains coordinates, blue ash, and the scent of burnt apologies. <words>232</words>
In exchange for shelter, she asks me to finish a clause inked years ago in salt: the payment in personal heat. <words>253</words>
I open the ledger and the softcover dictionary, translating her coastline dialect, and discover the Planner's signature braided with mine. <words>273</words>
The bargain was never broken, merely delayed, a lantern hung in plain sight, openly hidden within policy footnotes and my shivering silence. <words>295</words>
She guides me to the decommissioned kiln beneath the archives, where pressure hums and whales pronounce vowels against the foundations. <words>315</words>
I load the crucible with scrap filings from surrendered rings, the dictionary's peeled cover, and a sheath of rejected corridors. <words>335</words>
The woman watches, repeating the hitchhikers' rumors I had verified, aligning them like kindling until my memory catches, then burns clean. <words>356</words>
So I place my heartbreak on the tong's open mouth, admit my cowardice to the old metal, and feel the city listen. <words>378</words>
When the charge leaps, the conduits flare, and planning sheets curl into wings; sorrow turns steam, valves sing, and our buried lights ignite. <words>401</words>
The woman leaves by morning, a random hitchhiker no longer, while I stamp approved upon the bargain, finally finished by heat. <words>422</words>
In the underwater city planning office, I return to my desk, a meek blacksmith again, yet brighter for the debt repaid. <words>443</words>
And across the hush of time's final ripple, our maps glow with gentle contrition, guiding future ghosts through corridors we once refused. <words>465</words>
