I was an aloof cartographer mapping hearts instead of coastlines, hired by the mall to chart desire patterns. <words>18</words>
On opening day, the futuristic shopping mall glittered like a nebula trapped under glass, humming with algorithmic fountains. <words>36</words>
I arrived at the crossroads where two destinies exchange places, clutching a commission and a quiet ache. <words>53</words>
My commission was simple, my ache less so: to learn the language of the soul before the sale ended. <words>72</words>
The mall's central atrium contained a ceremonial display, a ceramic tile, cracked, rescued from the drowned library of old cities. <words>92</words>
They wanted me to plot the tile's provenance through customer footfall, to expand nostalgia into a navigable market. <words>110</words>
It felt inconspicuously blatant, like a whisper printed on a billboard, and yet the whisper was mine. <words>127</words>
Near the display stood Kade, a guide whose maps were made of rumors and whose voice knew river vowels. <words>146</words>
We recognized each other by the paddles clipped to our packs, a shared love for kayaking cutting through polish. <words>165</words>
Current met current; our trajectories eddied; my aloofness, rehearsed for years, stuttered into a smile. <words>180</words>
Kade traced the tile's hairline with a finger, and memories rose like mist from hidden springs. <words>196</words>
He spoke of coves where concrete domes slept, of malls drowned and salvaged, of names swallowed but remembering. <words>214</words>
I plotted routes through the atrium's holographic aisles, each path a filament tugging the ties of memory. <words>231</words>
Shoppers followed our breadcrumbs, and their purchases synchronized with recollection, a commerce of ache and relief. <words>247</words>
Amid the data, my map began to expand toward a coastline I feared: the inner archipelago of grief. <words>265</words>
Eager resignation settled over me, the willingness to continue despite knowing I would be changed. <words>280</words>
Kade and I took the service canal that threaded beneath the mall, kayaks whispering where escalators roared. <words>297</words>
We paddled past loading docks, listening for the soul's phonemes, vowels shaped by echo, consonants by rust. <words>314</words>
At the lock, the mechanisms stalled, and we spoke our cartographies aloud, exchanging destinies without ceremony. <words>330</words>
When the gates lifted, the tile's crack aligned with the canal's seam, and my map finally pronounced hello. <words>348</words>
The mall's AI asked for the translation, offering discount codes as rosary beads, but I kept paddling through hush. <words>367</words>
Kade listened with me, and together we charted inflections of longing, the syllables that price tags could not price. <words>386</words>
We surfaced into the atrium, dripping, our kayaks dripping too, and the crowd leaned in as if to a campfire. <words>406</words>
I read the map aloud, not with words but with routes, and the mall sighed like an old harbor finding tide. <words>427</words>
In that eager resignation, I knew the soul speaks in directions, and every direction is a promise to return. <words>446</words>
The tile gleamed, its crack a river on the floor, a line both wound and path, our destinies trading places again. <words>467</words>
As shoppers dispersed with softer footsteps, I packed my paddle and maps, newly fluent, and finally less alone. <words>485</words>
