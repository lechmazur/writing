<story>Through the restless hush of midwinter, the enclave's streets sounded like moth wings brushing iron fences. <words>16</words>
It was a xenophobic enclave, shuttered, stern, mistrusting any seed that the wind dared import. <words>31</words>
In this frost, the nervous kingpin Arvo moved softly, his power always measured by the quiet he could inhabit. <words>50</words>
He carried a collection of dried seed pods in a velvet pouch, a treasury clacking like teeth when he breathed. <words>70</words>
They were contraband here, botanical suspects, yet he believed their chances were unlikely probable, and he loved that paradox. <words>89</words>
Arvo was feared for debts and favors, but tonight he gathered gardeners, not enforcers, in a cellar lit by jars. <words>109</words>
They had one goal: to hold the line against the tyranny of indifference that starved their courtyards of touch and color. <words>130</words>
Their plan was a detour to visit a landmark seen on a sign beyond the checkpoint, the Old Aquifer Arch. <words>150</words>
The arch, once a celebration of shared water, now marked the border where patrols grinned like locks without keys. <words>169</words>
Arvo said the garden would begin there, life stitched into stone so the city could not pretend not to notice. <words>189</words>
Indifference, he knew, was the only rival he could not threaten, so he would unsettle it with tenderness and evidence. <words>209</words>
They walked in pairs through alleys that smelled of wet coal, past walls chalked with warnings in the enclave's tight script. <words>230</words>
Arvo kept his hands in his coat, feeling the pods, each a rattle of deferred rain and stored argument. <words>249</words>
At the checkpoint, a guard recognized him and smirked, but the power in Arvo's silence made the smirk wander away. <words>269</words>
They reached the arch, needled by wind, and the gardeners laid cloths like flags, kneeling with a fragile ferocity that warmed stone. <words>291</words>
Arvo opened the pouch and named each seed, naming hope in a language that could pass even a wall's suspicious ear. <words>312</words>
Each pod cracked open like a whisper, and the gardeners tucked life into seams, crossings, and graffiti serif curls. <words>331</words>
The plan was unlikely probable only because fear was certain, yet their certainty tasted of thyme, frost, and courage. <words>350</words>
When sirens finally stitched the distance, Arvo raised his palms, not to surrender, but to show the small brown mouths of tomorrow. <words>372</words>
He had ruled with favors because favors were human, and now he ruled himself, holding the line with communal gardens everyone could see. <words>395</words>
Neighbors emerged despite their rules, drawn by color in the night, and felt their grievances loosen like fur lined collars. <words>415</words>
Under the arch, Arvo finally trembled, not from fear, but because the city, unsettled into noticing, breathed back at last. <words>435</words>
