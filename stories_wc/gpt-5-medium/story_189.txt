<story>
After the last war was fought for water, I apprenticed in a haunted lighthouse basement to decode ancient star maps. <words>20</words>
They called me the bright-eyed apprentice, though my gaze was mostly a mirror hiding a uniquely literal mind. <words>38</words>
My master kept a phone booth key from a defunct phone company on a chain, saying it unlocked grand designs. <words>58</words>
The lighthouse whispered in wind and brine, and we listened with brazen calm learned from thirst and ruins. <words>76</words>
Power was scarce, so I learned to overcharge salvaged capacitors without waking the dead batteries that sulked upstairs. <words>94</words>
Our messages arrived by parsing notes slipped under doors, unsigned, damp, and written in ink that smelled like storms. <words>113</words>
Each note mapped a corridor of the sky onto the lighthouse stones, as if the building remembered weather older than language. <words>134</words>
My task was simple, and therefore impossible, to translate coordinates into light that the ghosts could steer by. <words>152</words>
The key turned in a rusted panel, revealing a rotary tumbler wired to the lantern, a relic of payphones and promises. <words>173</words>
My master believed someone had once phoned the stars from here, dialing constellations until the heavens gave a forwarding address. <words>193</words>
I disbelieved decoratively, but my hands stayed busy, aligning lenses, counting teeth, and measuring pauses between the walls breathing. <words>212</words>
Patterns formed, and my literal mind translated them as debts, credits, and overdue calls from a cosmos that remembered our overuse. <words>233</words>
I asked who slipped the notes; the master said the sea, which was uniquely literal of him, since the ink tasted like salt. <words>256</words>
When the generator coughed, I overcharged the array with a hand crank, smiling as sparks braided blue ladders through the damp. <words>277</words>
The lantern flared, and the rotary tumbler spun until the phone company logo ghosted across the beam like a seal. <words>297</words>
In that light, the stone stairs unfolded as a spiral galaxy in miniature, each step a star we could finally name. <words>318</words>
My master knelt, trembling, and I felt nothing but a calm so brazen it seemed borrowed from the lighthouse itself. <words>338</words>
The grand designs were plain: the notes were invoices, the sky an archive, and we were the last clerks authorized to settle accounts. <words>361</words>
We paid in current, overcharge levied against our dwindling nights and fears. <words>373</words>
The lantern answered with coordinates, numbers I parsed like tides, letter by letter. <words>386</words>
Each solved line unlocked a memory of rain, not falling, simply waiting. <words>398</words>
When we finished, the ghosts rang back, and the lighthouse breathed. <words>409</words>
