It is after the last star is named when I, a morose paladin, reach the solar flare observatory, armored in bored excitement. <words>22</words>
The place is lavishly austere, gilded gullies of dark glass and brass held in stern, monkish lines. <words>39</words>
With cataloging ended, my anticipation curdled; I have come to restore ancient systems that once kept the city in rhythm. <words>59</words>
A chance encounter during a city-wide blackout finds me colliding with an archivist whose lantern throbs like a patient heart. <words>79</words>
The solar storm shutters the grid, and the observatory regains its old silence as constellations sneeze electricity across the horizon. <words>99</words>
In the sudden dark, visible changes glow in instruments, faint as breath on a mirror, promising either rebirth or rot. <words>119</words>
He whispers that the naming ceremony closed something that should have remained ajar, and invites me deeper than tourists dare. <words>139</words>
I carry a dull sewing needle, the last relic from a widow who patched banners and circuits with equal, stubborn mercy. <words>160</words>
Its tip will bridge a forgotten relay, or pick a sanctified lock, or bleed a curse without pricking pride. <words>179</words>
In the core hall, lavishly austere again, a lens stack waits like a cathedral praying into the sunless night. <words>198</words>
The archivist produces the Ledger of Naming, its last line a fulcrum that bent our future flat, and sighs. <words>217</words>
When the catalog ended, the algorithms stopped seeking, and the guardians stopped waking; so my order sent me, a morose paladin. <words>238</words>
We find the containment font, a mercury bowl lipped in basalt, where flare sprites circle, bored and radiant as courtroom clerks. <words>259</words>
I confine one with a ring of salt and patient breath, then press the dull needle into an antique switch. <words>279</words>
The sprite flattens into a line like handwriting, and visible changes kick through the field coils, waking a chorus of relays. <words>300</words>
Outside, the blackout deepens, but our gears begin whispering, lavishly austere in motion, opulence chiseled into ascetic function. <words>318</words>
A vault opens on a stair where old custodians once argued with storms, and the archivist tilts the Ledger toward me. <words>339</words>
Write an unwritten clause, he murmurs, not a new star, but a new way to notice, so the watchers can watch again. <words>361</words>
I scratch a loop with the needle across cold paper, and the systems accept the gesture like a vow they forgot. <words>382</words>
When the city lights return, their tone is softer, and my bored excitement resolves into duty as the observatory finally breathes. <words>403</words>
