Between subway stops, I inventory the night I left the haunted attic. <words>12</words>
I am an insomniac poet with a meticulously messy desk and a mind like static. <words>27</words>
Empty abundance hums in the train lights, a surplus of silence I can almost name. <words>42</words>
Back then, the attic warned me in whispers braided through botanical samples pinned to rafters. <words>57</words>
Every leaf was a phoneme, every seed a comma placed by a restless ghost with green fingers. <words>74</words>
I had come there to eliminate the habit of harm that marched inside my poems. <words>89</words>
That night, my motive was simple: to discover the power of non-violence. <words>101</words>
Violence hid in my metaphors like snares disguised as similes, and readers bled without proof. <words>116</words>
The ghost offered instruction via drunken confessions at after-parties, where critics mistook ectoplasm for gin. <words>131</words>
Staggering scholars told me their softest stanzas happened when they forgave the knife. <words>144</words>
They dropped scalpels from their lines, and the rooms grew warmer, and no one fainted. <words>159</words>
Between stops, I remember the attic's catalog, the herbarium of warnings arranged like prayer. <words>173</words>
Mullein asked me to listen; nettle demanded distance; calendula begged for patient light. <words>186</words>
Pressed petals made maps of detours, and the ghost scratched annotations into dust. <words>199</words>
Eliminate the injury inside your appetite, it breathed, eliminate the urge to triumph by wounding. <words>214</words>
So I practiced apologies to spiders, to floorboards, to the window that rattled like teeth. <words>229</words>
I spoke to the botanical samples as if they were elders, and they answered with pollen. <words>245</words>
Their whispers were not commands but rooms where metal cooled and anger forgot its name. <words>260</words>
In those rooms, my meticulously messy drafts turned toward mercy, commas breathing like bellows. <words>274</words>
I learned to stage conflict as a conversation where the bruise healed while the sentence unfolded. <words>290</words>
The ghost clapped without sound and shook the rafters until the herbs snowed their seeds. <words>305</words>
I tucked the seeds in matchboxes, promising not fire but futures, and I left before dawn. <words>321</words>
Now the train yaws into darkness, and my phone reflects a face learning to be gentle. <words>337</words>
Between subway stops, I test a new line that carries water instead of blades. <words>351</words>
Warnings in whispers travel with me, collecting like dew on the lips of each idea. <words>366</words>
If I must eliminate anything, I will eliminate the applause that arrives only after blood. <words>381</words>
I will write truce songs and lay them among the samples, letting the attic breathe through them. <words>398</words>
Later, at literal after-parties, I will offer water, and wait for drunk critics to confess kindness. <words>414</words>
Their swagger will loosen into stories of restraint, and the ghost will ride the chandelier, laughing. <words>430</words>
When we surface, I will mail the matchboxes to strangers, a quietly abundant archive of gentling seeds. <words>447</words>
The train doors open, and the night drafts in, scattered, incomplete, and still more than enough. <words>463</words>
