<story>The baroque asteroid turned slowly, a jeweled reliquary adrift under borrowed starlight.<words>12</words>
Along its engraved boulevards, the last bus hissed to a halt as the driver completed the final route.<words>30</words>
He stepped down, palms raw from the wheel, wanting nothing more than to cradle the dawn in trembling hands.<words>49</words>
But the timetable of stars allowed no tenderness, only the unforgiving road sketched in orbits and debts.<words>66</words>
From a shadowed cornice, a lurking assassin watched him through a paint-splattered camera lens, the colors like dried bruises on glass.<words>87</words>
The lens softened everything, and yet it sharpened the intent she carried like a folded letter under the tongue.<words>106</words>
Her employers had sent a mantra, superficially profound, about mercy being an angle of approach rather than a destination.<words>125</words>
She let herself laugh once, quietly, because angles do not bleed and destinations rarely pay.<words>140</words>
Across the plaza, the driver studied puddles that had survived the vacuum under domed glass, tracing his route via the pattern of a spider's web after rain.<words>167</words>
Threads of silver linked stops where the elderly waited, where miners slumped, where a child carried a cage of mechanical moths.<words>188</words>
He loved them with a stubbornness that his supervisors called inefficient, and that she, watching, recognized as the only map worth trusting.<words>210</words>
Her contract named the driver a liability, a witness, a man whose routes stitched witnesses into a chorus that might awaken the sleeping lords of the asteroid.<words>237</words>
They preferred silence, gilded and echoing, so the music of brakes and greetings had to end tonight.<words>254</words>
She descended the steps while the galleries breathed dust, and the borrowed starlight made the marble seem almost warm.<words>273</words>
The driver saw the smeared lens glint and thought of a sunrise caught behind cracked glass, a dawn delirious with colors he had no words for.<words>299</words>
He raised his hands as if truly to cradle it, and the gesture stilled her like a pin through a comet's tail.<words>321</words>
In the moat of the plaza, fountains hummed; droplets arrayed themselves into constellations, and she computed trajectories through their trembling lattice.<words>342</words>
The answer, like the web she mimed with her gloved fingers, told her the bullet would ricochet into the bus and unspool every name he had ferried.<words>369</words>
She lowered the gun because the unforgiving road does not forgive collateral music.<words>382</words>
He, misreading mercy as schedule, offered her a seat as though she were merely late.<words>397</words>
She took it, and the bus doors folded like wings, and together they rode past facades chiseled with saints who never learned to bless the miners.<words>423</words>
Somewhere between the chapel and the quarry, she returned the camera, paint-splattered and weary, to his hands, and asked what he saw when every pane lied.<words>449</words>
He said the lens made the night honest, because it refused clarity, because it let people look like the trembling dawn they carried but could not hold.<words>476</words>
And when the bus driver completes the final route, dawn arrives, and his shaking hands do not spill it this time.<words>497</words></story>
