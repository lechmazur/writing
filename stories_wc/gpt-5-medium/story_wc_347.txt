<story>The cliffside labyrinth sloped and folded like a fist opening slowly to the sea. [14]
Above it, mechanical birds swept patrol arcs, their brass feathers scraping the wind. [27]
I lived there, the reluctant caretaker of a cursed orchard braided through its paths. [41]
The trees drank salt spray and whispered to the rocks about broken promises. [54]
Each season I promised to leave, and each season their roots tightened around me. [68]
My task was not to prune, nor harvest, but to guide lost travelers to safety. [83]
The orchard demanded that of anyone who ate its fruit and heard its histories. [97]
I had eaten once, in grief, and the duty had settled like a thorned halo. [112]
On the first morning of winter, a woman and her son stumbled into the rows. [127]
They had followed the cliff path and wandered into the orchard's shifting geometry. [140]
Behind them, birds clicked like rake teeth, sorting air into territories. [151]
Before the night frost forms, you must be out of the labyrinth, I told them. [166]
My voice sounded offhandedly exact, as if numbers lived in my throat. [178]
They flinched when the nearest apple turned inside out and showed its wooden bones. [192]
The orchard does that when it smells fear, I said, not unkindly. [204]
Come, we have until the shadow of the cliff reaches that split trunk. [217]
I began to walk without touching the ground, leaving impressions without touching anything at all. [232]
It was a trick the roots had taught me, a way to avoid waking old curses. [248]
The boy gasped, the woman steadied him, and the birds marked another pass overhead. [262]
You two will walk where I walk, heel to hollow, breath for breath. [275]
We must assemble ourselves into a single set of traces the orchard cannot parse. [289]
I said it like prayer, and the roots hummed a reluctant amen under the soil. [304]
There was a blueprint to the place once, a city planned on paper and pride. [319]
Storms tore it away, and the builders forgot, and then the trees remembered differently. [333]
What remains is a forgotten blueprint, rewritten hourly by wind, salt, and sap. [346]
I carry it in my body the way a compass carries north. [358]
We slipped between pear limbs that snagged our coats with tender, unrepentant hooks. [371]
We stepped across a trench where the ground tried to imitate a river and failed. [386]
We waited while a flock of clockwork wings sheared the path into glittering chaff. [400]
The boy carried a small nut in his pocket, polished by worry and wishing. [414]
He showed it to me and asked whether it might grow into a safer world. [429]
Only if you teach it the right shapes, I said, and he nodded solemnly. [443]
He placed it on his tongue and let it learn our breathing. [455]
From the cliff came a horn note, metallic, announcing a patrol change. [467]
Night frost would arrive early; the orchard tasted it in the north wind. [480]
We hurried toward a thinning in the hedges where a lichen map burned faintly. [494]
It was the orchard's memory of the lost city, dim but loyal to its corridors. [509]
I moved my hands through the air, leaving impressions without touching, coaxing doorways from absence. [524]
The woman whispered that I looked like someone praying and drowning at once. [537]
That is graceless beauty, I said, and the orchard accepted the compliment. [549]
We entered a corridor of stone that remembered being a street where markets once argued. [564]
The boy spat the nut into his hand and pressed it to a crack. [578]
The little thing clicked, and the wall answered like a lock recognizing home. [591]
Seeds remember the first door, I told him, and he smiled with shy pride. [605]
We stepped through into the open, the cliff face yawning like a careful warning. [619]
Below, the beach unrolled its cold ribbon toward the village where fires bristled awake. [633]
Behind us, the birds wheeled, uncertain, then settled back into their glittering laws. [646]
The woman thanked me, but her words snagged in the wind and salted my eyes. [661]
Go before the frost takes the paths and makes them lie, I told her. [675]
She tightened her scarf and began climbing the switchbacks with the boy beside. [688]
He looked back, raised the nut, and mouthed a promise to plant it safely. [702]
I stayed until their shapes became simple, then vanished into shadow and smoke. [715]
The orchard loosened its hold, just a little, because I had obeyed its bargain. [729]
I returned to the rows, where apples study gravity and peaches rehearse seduction. [742]
I traced the absent streets with my hands, assembling the forgotten blueprint from breaths. [756]
Somewhere above, another pair of boots tested the path, and the birds clicked yes. [770]
Before the night frost forms, I will find them; afterward, the orchard will find me. [785]
Thus the hours coil, graceless and beautiful, and the cliffs hold their breath. [798]</story>
