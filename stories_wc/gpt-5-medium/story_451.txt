I hired actors to play versions of me because my twin and I were separated at birth, and mirrors have stopped offering reliable witnesses. <words>24</words>
Their auditions unfolded amid farmers market bustle far below the mysterious mountain peak where I waited, crystal shadows threading the snow like veins of unspoken omens. <words>50</words>
The real drama, though, was a clandestine meeting in a hidden location: a cave behind a scree slide, sealed by frost and rumor. <words>73</words>
Inside, an old woman offered a baseball signed by a time traveler, its stitches bruised purple as if holding the pulse of collisions. <words>96</words>
She said the signature carried forbidden knowledge, a trajectory of futures engraved in seams, readable only by those missing their first name at birth. <words>120</words>
I wanted to outlive an apocalyptic prophecy that stalked my family, a calendar of whispers predicting one twin would end the world by vanishing. <words>144</words>
So I hired actors to subdue certainty, letting them circulate through town as prototypes, decoys designed to draw the prophecy's stare away from my organs. <words>169</words>
Each actor wore a typically unique scar I scripted from dreams, a crescent near the temple where my mother swore lightning kissed our infant brows. <words>194</words>
The old woman pressed the ball into my hands, its chill like a small moon, and told me to pitch truth into the cave's throat. <words>219</words>
When I threw, the air curved, and another self stepped out of the shadow, blinking as the farmers market bells floated up the ravines. <words>243</words>
He looked like the actor I preferred, yet his left eye held glacier debris, and his palm bore my childhood ink: a compass that searched. <words>268</words>
We began speaking in the codes our mother taught before the hospital doors swallowed her, half lullaby, half map, while the summit wind tuned everything metallic. <words>294</words>
He said he was the one who vanished, a twin folded between seconds, hired by other lives to audition for mine until the signature ripened. <words>319</words>
The baseball hushed, and from its leather came a skittering projection of years, every catastrophe looping unless we traded places without alerting the prophecy. <words>343</words>
Subdue your fear, he said, because our identity is a moving target, and the only safe story is the one a time traveler signs. <words>367</words>
I agreed to switch, and the actors surrounded us like a chorus, their breathing steady as the market below, their faces wet with patient snowmelt. <words>392</words>
We walked into the cave's mouth, traded jackets, scars, and the compass, while crystal shadows rearranged the calendar so the vanishing would arrive too late. <words>417</words>
Outside, the peak exhaled, and the farmers market clatter softened into ordinary weather; the prophecy blinked past us, mistaking my actors for fate, and moved on. <words>443</words>
