At the hush after a cashier closes out the register, I climb the steps to the temple in the clouds. <words>20</words>
The stairs feel like breaths held too long, releasing as the mist parts and reveals my patient teacher, a subtle illusionist. <words>41</words>
He smiles with doleful cheer, casually intense in the way only someone practiced at vanishing understands presence. <words>58</words>
I have come to learn the language of the heart, which he insists is spoken best when wind rearranges what we assume is fixed. <words>82</words>
He carries an unmarked binder clip like a talisman, pinching together pages that appear blank until you look sideways. <words>101</words>
Sideways is how the understory grows, he says, roots listening under the floorboards of speech while leaves play at conversation. <words>121</words>
He hands me lace, antique and tender, a shawl whose holes are letters and whose knots are verbs we have forgotten. <words>142</words>
Learn through instructions woven into an antique lace pattern, he whispers, and you will know where to place your silences. <words>162</words>
When I drape it over the altar, the wind reads back my doubts, and the pillars hum with soft corrections. <words>182</words>
The illusionist points at the binder clip and says it binds what language drops, a small gravity for stray meanings. <words>202</words>
In that altitude the city flickers below like coins in a jar, counted and discounted by unseen hands. <words>220</words>
It is late enough that even commerce goes quiet, and the hush after the register mirrors the hush inside my chest. <words>241</words>
I tell him I wanted to rekindle an old promise I made to speak without disguises. <words>257</words>
He nods, casually intense again, and calls down a bell made of vapor that rings as if remembering rain. <words>276</words>
Every peal loosens a mask, and I watch my practiced smiles topple like small altars no one worships at anymore. <words>296</words>
Through the lace I see annotations, arrows and margins mapped by ghostly hands, guiding me toward the syllables I fear. <words>316</words>
They tell me to bend my voice like a tree yielding to storm, because beneath the chatter the understory grows resilience. <words>337</words>
I press the lace to my throat, and words arrive like seedlings, fragile yet stubborn, looking for light in difficult air. <words>358</words>
The illusionist slides off his rings and clips the lace with the unmarked binder clip, fastening chance to intention. <words>377</words>
In that neat click I hear a door unlatch, and my chest answers with a key I did not know I carried. <words>399</words>
We practice until starlight lifts the floor, and my sentences feel like kneeling without fear of not rising. <words>417</words>
At last he bows and says the heart is a market and a monastery, and learning it means paying and praying at once. <words>440</words>
I leave the clouded threshold carrying lace, clip, and a promise that whenever the city counts me, I will count back with mercy. <words>463</words>
Below, shop lights blink out, but higher up the temple keeps its gentle ledger, rekindled nightly by the understory that grows in us. <words>486</words>
