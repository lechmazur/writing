I was a jovial sellsword until the night I guarded a witch's herb garden under a sky frothed with omens. <words>20</words>
Payment was laughter, stew, and a peculiar astronomical telescope she insisted could steady more than stars. <words>36</words>
She spoke of elegant mayhem like it was cuisine, flambeed troubles served on silver thorns, and I grinned despite my scars. <words>57</words>
Her bargain hinged on the withering vow, a rite that squeezes doubt until it shells itself like a dying seed. <words>77</words>
I was boldly reluctant, because courage without reluctance is only noise, and fear without boldness is a locked cellar. <words>96</words>
She said the vow would unfurl throughout the transformation, as basil sang, rue scolded, and moonlit rosemary arranged our shadows like soldiers. <words>118</words>
We aimed to dethrone doubt from the mind, not banish it, for dethroned kings can still advise from simpler chairs. <words>138</words>
She pointed the telescope at a cauldron of constellations, and I peered through, seeing my past duels pinned like moths on velvet. <words>160</words>
The astronomical telescope behaved like a clarinet of glass, teasing notes from light, until my laughter matched the trembling lenses. <words>180</words>
She asked me to treasure what surfaced, every bruise that had taught mercy, every coin that had purchased grief. <words>199</words>
To keep the vow alive when silence returned, we would use her family tradition of making a time capsule beneath the fennel. <words>221</words>
Into a jar we poured star charts, crushed lavender, and the quivering confession that I had always performed bravery for audiences unseen. <words>243</words>
The witch, named Perigee, pressed my sword flat on sage, and the steel drank an aroma like clean thunder. <words>262</words>
She told me every hired blade swears some withering vow, and the ones who keep it learn to laugh without lying. <words>283</words>
Then the garden erupted in elegant mayhem: dill crows flew, thyme rang like coins in a cracked cathedral, and my doubt tried to crown itself again. <words>309</words>
Perigee steadied me with a finger to my brow, as if tuning a string, and asked what throne doubt deserved. <words>329</words>
I answered boldly reluctant, saying it should sit on the ground among nettles, a teacher without a crown, a monarch turned mulch. <words>351</words>
The withering vow accepted like rain into dust, and the telescope showed a future where my grin was not armor but welcome. <words>373</words>
We buried the time capsule beside the fennel, marking the soil with a circle of rosemary stems that smelled like fresh decisions. <words>395</words>
I promised to visit, to treasure the lessons as provisions, and to spend my hire on candor instead of wine when songs demanded. <words>418</words>
Perigee lifted the telescope one last time, aligning it with a star that winked like a ruffian, and declared my laughter legally binding. <words>441</words>
I left the witch's herb garden humming, a sellsword still jovial, yet newly sworn to guide others throughout the transformation their doubts attempt. <words>464</words>
That night, the path felt clean as polished steel, and my shadow walked beside me, unthroned and useful, laughing when the crickets missed a beat. <words>489</words>
