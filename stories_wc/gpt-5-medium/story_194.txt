I pedal past the river before dawn, legs drumming a pact with the aching dark. <words>15</words>
I repeat vows throughout bike rides, rehearsing a menu of ghosts. <words>26</words>
I am a spirited lumberjack apprenticed to knives, not axes, in an ancient ossuary turned gourmet restaurant. <words>43</words>
My movements are gracefully awkward, like a pine tree bowing in a storm yet refusing to split. <words>60</words>
Yesterday a cyclist slipped me a coded letter from a future war, brittle as a parchment bone. <words>77</words>
It pulsed with hidden agendas that smelled like bay leaves and burned cedar. <words>90</words>
I opened it with harsh tenderness, the way I handle marrow bones thick with memory. <words>105</words>
The script asked me to revamp our dinner service into a sanctuary, to learn healing traditions before the fires arrive. <words>125</words>
Maps of battles unfurled through reawakened nightmares whenever I blinked, lines marching across my cutting boards. <words>141</words>
Our tables rest on niches where skulls once listened, and the walls still hum with the names of strangers. <words>160</words>
The chef believes in spectacle, powdered bone sugar, truffle veils, and a procession of torches. <words>175</words>
I stayed to learn healing traditions from the old dishwasher, a midwife once, who salts like a priest. <words>193</words>
He taught me to whisper over broth and to listen for fractures that soup could knit. <words>209</words>
But the letter said the chef would sell the bones to investors, a banquet of hidden agendas masquerading as philanthropy. <words>229</words>
I asked for a night alone, to design a counter menu that could slow the war inside their bellies. <words>248</words>
Gracefully awkward, I arranged femurs like flutes, letting steam play notes only a fever refuses to forget. <words>265</words>
My arms remembered felling trees, but now they cleaved silence, releasing sap stories from roasted roots. <words>281</words>
Through reawakened nightmares, I salted dishes to dull the trigger of gunmetal dreams and brightened grief with citrus. <words>299</words>
Guests chewed, slowed, and then cried without knowing why, bones inside them aligning like windfallen logs. <words>315</words>
The chef cornered me by the reliquary oven, voice a rasp of harsh tenderness that still meant to wound. <words>334</words>
I handed over the coded letter from a future war, and the chef blanched, recognizing their own signature spiraling backward. <words>354</words>
Together we chose to revamp the house into a ward, and I, a spirited lumberjack, would carry plates like saplings. <words>374</words>
Outside, the bicycles waited, their chains glimmering like rosaries, inviting our contrition to keep moving. <words>389</words>
We promised the dead new recipes, not to profit, but to steady hands that tremble over the next day's news. <words>409</words>
As service ended, the dishwasher anointed our brows with steam, saying the cure starts when a hunger listens. <words>427</words>
I mounted my bike, scheduled to return before sunrise, because some wars surrender only to persistent meals. <words>444</words>
Each pedal stroke tapped the letter in my pocket, and the future slowed enough to taste its own apology. <words>463</words>
