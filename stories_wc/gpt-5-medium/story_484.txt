I am a groggy brewer trailing steam and second thoughts through the haunted mansion graveyard, mug in hand. <words>18</words>
Beyond the crumbling fence, the city chants hush to a hush, during the lull in a protest when voices gather again. <words>39</words>
Nothing like civil unrest to season a graveyard tour, I say with flippant solemnity, tipping stale foam to the tombs. <words>59</words>
But the encroaching darkness here is not only sky and rumor; it pools like porter in the corners of memory. <words>79</words>
I came to initiate a ridiculous sacrament: to become a living embodiment of my values, however wobbly they might be. <words>99</words>
Craft, patience, and neighborliness, brewed kindly even when the world curdles, are my grain bill and my boast. <words>117</words>
In my pocket clinks a piece of a broken mirror, salvaged from my taproom after last week decided to riot. <words>137</words>
Its reflection is uniquely generic, as if all faces were placeholder labels, mine included, waiting to be printed correctly. <words>156</words>
The mansion invited me inside via the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase, like a bruise that whispered down. <words>176</words>
I followed, descending, while over the hedge the protest changed key, the old names of the dead doubling as slogans. <words>196</words>
At the landing, the encroaching darkness seemed to initiate a roll call, not of ghosts, but of my unfinished promises. <words>216</words>
I told the shadows they could at least buy a round before interrogations, and their silence clinked like coins on wood. <words>237</words>
I raised the mirror shard, catching a shy vein of moonlight, and aimed it outward to the headstones like a toast. <words>258</words>
The glass returned not my face but a taproom at dawn, my younger self brewing patience while the radio rehearsed disasters. <words>279</words>
I realized the values I brag about are not labels; they are moving yeast, alive only when fed and performed. <words>299</words>
The spirits, finally spending one coin, asked for a pint of generosity that did not stop at the fence line. <words>319</words>
So I promised to brew here for the graves as well as the living, and to carry kegs to the marchers. <words>340</words>
To seal it, I initiate the ritual by pouring foam along that bruise, the slightest discoloration on the dusty spiral staircase. <words>361</words>
Outside, voices gather again and swell; the encroaching darkness recedes like spent malt husks, which is not poetry, just cleanup. <words>381</words>
A uniquely generic brewer becomes particular by choice; I shoulder my keg, salute the graves, and step toward the chanting light. <words>402</words>
