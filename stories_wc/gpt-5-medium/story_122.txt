<story>I met the cyber-templar on a collision course with reality at the cliffside sky burial site. <words>16</words>
Bone towers chimed like chimes, and prayer flags hummed with euphoric agitation in the altitude-thin wind. <words>32</words>
He wore a worn leather bridle wound around his gauntlets, as if reins might steer thunder. <words>48</words>
He said the bridle remembered unbroken roads, which is why it creaked whenever storms misplaced their purpose. <words>65</words>
I had come during reading, the field manual open, my lips murmuring glyphs for shelter and voltage. <words>82</words>
He asked what I sought to prove, and my answer surprised us both. <words>95</words>
I said I wanted to reflect lightning back at the storm, to give the sky a mirror. <words>112</words>
The cyber-templar nodded, patiently frantic, as if calm could sprint and panic could kneel. <words>126</words>
He lifted a prism from a reliquary forged of cracked lenses and antenna stubs. <words>140</words>
We would send our reading into the weather through the refraction of light through a prism. <words>156</words>
Words, he said, were seeds; angles, the soil; and the winds, only hungry news. <words>170</words>
The manual insisted the mirage of safety was an error in viewing, not in danger. <words>185</words>
So we held the bridle taut between us, binding our wrists in a loop of remembered roads. <words>202</words>
He read the sky; I read the page; and together we aligned the margins with the horizons. <words>219</words>
Clouds built cathedrals, flickering with nave-wide pulses, as vultures circled like choirboys unafraid of bones. <words>234</words>
He whispered, Prove the page to the sky, and prove the sky to the page. <words>249</words>
I angled the prism over the manual's diagram, skimming each sentence until letters became spectrums. <words>264</words>
Through the refraction, paragraphs unfolded into ladders, and the wind climbed them, breathless, delighted, inexhaustible. <words>279</words>
Lightning tested the ladders, walked down to us with a swordsman's patience, tasting the leather for memory. <words>296</words>
We did not kneel; we tightened the bridle, and the prism bridged its bite. <words>310</words>
Then the cyber-templar adjusted the reliquary, aligning prayer-flag shadows with chapter headings until the voltage listened. <words>326</words>
When the bolt descended again, the prism sang, and the reflected stroke arced backward into its parent cloud. <words>344</words>
For an instant, the storm saw itself, and the mirage of safety shattered into honest peril we could handle. <words>363</words>
We laughed with euphoric agitation, stunned by our own patient frenzy, and by the sky's revealed humility. <words>380</words>
The cyber-templar loosened the bridle, kissed its salt, and said collision had only corrected our trajectory. <words>396</words>
Reality was not a wall but a saddle, and the reins were for returning storms to themselves. <words>413</words>
I finished reading aloud, every sentence now bridged by color, every horizon annotated by prism-light, every vow signed. <words>431</words>
The vultures settled among the flags like scribes, and the manual closed itself with a gusty amen. <words>448</words>
We left the sky burial site carrying only the prism, its rainy heart still tasting of thunder. <words>465</words>
Inside it, our proof kept walking, patiently frantic, toward every future storm that mistakes itself for shelter. <words>482</words></story>
