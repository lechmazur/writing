<story>I arrived in the underwater coral reef city wearing a blacksmith's apron instead of armor, humming a crooked tune. <words>19</words>
They called me a roguish minstrel, a title I accepted like salt accepts the sea. <words>34</words>
Here, fish glowed like lanterns advertising wars long ended, and domes breathed tides through tired stone ribs. <words>51</words>
I had come to decode consciousness patterns whispered by currents, as dust gathers on an untouched piano above. <words>69</words>
The city wanted music but feared lyrics, so my melodies threaded lightly, spontaneously cautious like darting damselfish. <words>86</words>
I bartered for air in shells and stories, and for silence in access to their secret libraries. <words>103</words>
There I found a drowned map, its ink branching like coral polyps, guiding me toward a forgotten shore. <words>121</words>
I traveled through whale tunnels until the city sounded like a drum muted by thick velvet. <words>137</words>
On that edge between salt and silt, I worked by sifting through driftwood carvings along a forgotten shore. <words>155</words>
Faces stared back, notched into wood by waves, hieroglyphs of shipwrecked dreams and unfinished songs. <words>170</words>
Each figure yielded a rhythm when tapped, and the rhythms aligned into a grammar fit for minds without skin. <words>189</words>
I played that grammar on my battered lute, and the city felt its own heartbeat changing tempo. <words>206</words>
Surging ideals began to circulate like spring plankton, invisible yet nourishing, and the authorities tasted a strange sweetness in their tea. <words>227</words>
They sought to galvanize fear, summoning sirens and fines, but the notes I smuggled into markets dissolved their proclamations. <words>246</words>
Children began carving driftwood too, remembering ancestors who had sung before laws learned to crawl. <words>261</words>
Elders traded my blacksmith's apron for a cloak of sea grass, saying I would need fewer sparks and more camouflage. <words>281</words>
I kept the apron folded under my heart, a reminder that metal remembers shape even after drowning. <words>298</words>
The movement stayed a quiet revolution, because quiet travels farther underwater, and revolt sounds like breathing taken back. <words>316</words>
My strategies were nimble and spontaneously cautious; I never lit a flame when a ripple could suffice. <words>333</words>
When officials raided rehearsal caves, we taught octopuses to hide the scores in their unfurling homes. <words>349</words>
When guards fined laughter, we practiced stillness until meaning moved like a ray's shadow across the plaza. <words>366</words>
All the while, I tuned my ears to the carvings, decoding patterns that mirrored storms in sleeping brains. <words>384</words>
When the code completed, it said the city itself was a mind, and we were its unremembered dream. <words>402</words>
I sang the city awake, gently, like shaking someone from fever, until windows exhaled and statues blinked. <words>419</words>
The rulers, hearing their reflections speak through barnacles, laid down their batons as though setting knives back into kitchens. <words>438</words>
No cheers followed, only a hush that loosened knots and turned currents into corridors. <words>452</words>
I left then, not triumphant but useful, my apron pressed to my chest, my lute tasting of salt and file. <words>472</words>
Far above, the dust kept gathering on the untouched piano, and no one hurried to play it yet. <words>490</words>
