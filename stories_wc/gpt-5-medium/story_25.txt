<story>They enter slowly, dust wreathing the aisles, as the curtain reveals an ultraviolet forest glowing like bruised auroras. <words>18</words>
At center stage stands a sea-worn mariner whose eyes are coldly intense, salt-rimed beacons aimed past the footlights into someone else's storm. <words>40</words>
He waits as the audience trickles in to a dusty theater, measuring their hush the way sailors measure current. <words>59</words>
In his hands rests a forgotten diary, its vellum swollen with brine and a promise that erased every shore. <words>78</words>
He has come to set reason ablaze with wonder, and he will do it by telling the costliest truth he knows. <words>99</words>
Freedom, he says, always presents a ledger, and salt makes every number sting. <words>112</words>
The set behind him climbs like a shipwrecked dream, a hand-carved ladder vanishing into ultraviolet leaves. <words>128</words>
He begins by analyzing the uneven rung spacing on a hand-carved ladder, explaining how the maker encoded winds, reefs, and exit routes in the gaps. <words>153</words>
To survive, he learned to assimilate not just weather but intention, because timber whispers when a ruler is lying. <words>172</words>
The audience leans forward with the fickle loyalty of gulls, ready to adore or abandon the story at the next shift of wind. <words>195</words>
He speaks of a mutiny where freedom demanded a coin no purse could carry, paid instead with names scraped from the mast. <words>217</words>
The forgotten diary records their bargains in cramped letters, each page a contract signed in sleeplessness. <words>233</words>
His delivery is coldly intense, not cruel but precise, like sounding a reef with the last unbroken oar. <words>251</words>
The ultraviolet forest flickers, bark fluorescing as if memory itself were coral catching stray lightning from a black sea. <words>270</words>
By the ladder's uneven counsel he once found a harbor nobody owned, but anchoring there cost him the right to call any other place home. <words>295</words>
He tried to assimilate peace like a new dialect, practicing silence until his tongue bruised, yet the sea kept spelling his name in wave-foam. <words>319</words>
Latecomers shuffle to seats, dust motes drifting like plankton, and the theater breathes him in as if deciding whether to keep or release him. <words>343</words>
He closes the diary and names the price of freedom aloud: a compass set to wonder over safety, a crew of doubts, and a captain you may forgive only sometimes. <words>373</words>
Applause rises, scattered and then surging, the fickle loyalty of gulls transformed into a tide that drags questions toward open water. <words>394</words>
He bows like a mast in gale, and the ultraviolet forest dims to embers while the ladder's rungs gleam like knuckles that have learned mercy. <words>419</words>
Some will leave unmoved, but others will carry the forgotten diary in their heads, pages turning whenever they hesitate at thresholds. <words>440</words>
And so, as the doors yawn for night, his tale continues to set reason ablaze with wonder, assimilating fear into curiosity, one uneven rung at a time. <words>467</words></story>
