<story>I found the market for bartered destinies beneath the stone ribs of the old city. [15]
It breathed like a sleeping beast within the glow of half-lit corridors, and the air tasted of candle soot. [34]
They called me a reckless idealist at the thresholds, and they were right. [47]
I had come to patch holes in the soul that grief had chewed into the people I loved. [65]
I carried a burned tarot card wrapped in linen, its edges curled like a quiet snarl. [81]
It had been my grandmother's, and the fire that marked it had taken her lungs. [96]
She said the card could trammel a fate if you asked it with kindness and refused to blink. [114]
Kindness was my blade, fiercely gentle and sharpened by stubborn patience. [125]
The catacomb orchard opened like a mouth below the market's final stair. [137]
Tree roots snaked between bones, and the bones chimed whenever a breeze lost its way. [152]
Vendors hung lanterns from root-knuckles, and the brass light pooled like thin honey. [165]
Every stall offered a promising shard: a name without a past, a laugh unearned, a door that always opened. [184]
I went to the Weaver, the woman who spun contracts from ivy stems and inked them with river silt. [203]
Her face was a palimpsest of old deals, inlaying meaning everywhere the shadows dared to rest. [219]
Your card has teeth, she murmured, but it wants a tongue. [230]
What does a destiny cost, I asked, still tasting the ash of my grandmother's last story. [246]
She did not answer with numbers. [252]
The Weaver lifted the card, and the ash on its back arranged itself into a map of the orchard. [271]
Every root on the map bent toward a single pit where the bones looked like an upturned hand. [289]
Bring a destiny that refuses you, she said, and I will barter it for one that thrums in your chest. [309]
The pit held a boy with cindery eyes, humming to the bone-hand as if it were a trapped bird. [328]
He had been sold a soldier's future for the price of a loaf, and the future fit him like iron shoes. [349]
I asked his name, and he said the market had taken it as a tax. [364]
I gave him mine to hold for a while, so he would not feel empty when the tide of noise receded. [385]
The Weaver watched, measuring the space between our breaths as if that were the ledger. [400]
I told the boy I wanted to trade his iron shoes for a path that could still bend. [418]
He laughed, fiercely gentle despite the grit in it, and pressed his forehead to the burned tarot card. [436]
It warmed as if remembering a summer not yet born. [446]
I spoke the promise my grandmother taught me, in words that trammel cruelty but loosen hope. [462]
The card hissed, and the ash map rippled, inlaying meaning everywhere our shadows leaned. [476]
I offered the destiny that refused the boy back to the market, and bartered it for the hush of a scholar. [497]
The hush did not deny courage, but it spoke through pages and repaired instead of erased. [513]
The Weaver stamped the contract with a fern, and the boy's shoulders fell like a cliff relieved of scaffolding. [532]
He returned my name, and his new hush settled over his cindery eyes like rain on coal. [549]
It was not silence; it was a door that listened before it opened. [562]
I felt a seam close inside me, a stitch placed where the ache had been gnawing. [578]
Dusky resolve gathered in my chest, flavored with relief and the bite of risk. [592]
I asked the Weaver what debt I owed for the bartered destinies we had rearranged. [607]
She smiled without teeth and pointed to the place where the bone-hand cupped the earth. [622]
Plant what you will never keep, she said, because growth must be borrowed to be wise. [638]
I knelt and pressed my palms into the ash, then scattered the last of my grandmother's stories into the roots. [658]
They were not words, but seeds of listening, little lights that could find the lost by noticing them. [676]
The orchard shivered, and the lanterns swung, and the bones rang a note that tasted of mercy. [693]
The boy slipped away to learn the hush of one who mends, and I stayed to tend the listening seeds. [713]
Night folded deeper into the corridors, but their half-light kept a promise against my skin. [728]
I was still a reckless idealist, foolish with hope, yet the foolishness had learned how to hold its breath. [747]
I would go on inlaying meaning everywhere I walked, not to decorate, but to remind the dark it was seen. [767]
And when the market breathed again, I would return with more names to trade, more holes to patch, and one card still warm with a tongue. [793]</story>
