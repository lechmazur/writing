<story>I was a vivid mural artist, quietly driven by questions that would not sleep. [14]
Among them, one kept pressing its petals to my throat: why do flowers bloom at night? [30]
I reckoned that if color could learn to speak after dusk, then meaning might too. [45]
So I began in late winter, when the town held its breath across the melting of winter's last snow. [64]
My studio window looked toward the cathedral, and its tall nave kept a dawning hush even at noon. [82]
The verger let me climb a scaffold to study the hidden layers of etched glass in a cathedral window. [101]
He said artists had once used those layers to filter light for secrets, but no one had asked in years. [121]
I pressed my palm to the cool pane and felt a hush move under it like a cat between rails. [141]
Through glass etched with vines and moons, the street below wavered into a negative of itself. [157]
Night, I thought, is not the opposite of day but a careful engraving that lets certain truths appear. [175]
To test this, I opened my collection of old postcards, all of them written by my grandmother the botanist. [194]
She had traveled as warder of wandering gardens, writing to a stranger she called Future Painter. [210]
The cards smelled of cloves and iron, and bore ink drawings of moon moths, bats, and pale orchids. [228]
Between salutations, she had recorded temperatures, phases, and whispers about flowers that opened like sighs. [243]
One note said, If you listen through layers, you will hear how petals keep a promise the sun cannot hold. [263]
Another card sketched a window like the one before me, each etched vine marking a wind channel for scent. [282]
I took the hint and waited in the loft until twilight, when the choir practice ended and the bells fell still. [303]
As the last snow slumped off eaves in gray rivulets, a cool draft braided itself through the glass layers. [322]
I closed my eyes and let the draft carry the incense of night blooming tobacco from the cathedral garden. [341]
I could reckon the pattern by scent and silence, like reading a scored line for the throat rather than the hand. [362]
In that dawning hush between vespers and true dark, I felt a hinge turn, and a new mural unfolded inside me. [383]
It would be painted over months, across the melting snows and the softening nights, then finished when leaves turned copper. [403]
I returned to the studio and mapped the first panel, a street seen through etched vines, the lamps rendered as pollens. [424]
The second panel honored the postcards, each card a small window where a moth crossed from one scent to another. [444]
The third swelled with a procession of night workers: bats like gloved hands, beetles like beads, all moving in umbral tenderness. [465]
I worked quietly driven, rising before dawn to grind pigments and stay past midnight to polish the halos of figures. [485]
Neighbors brought soup and speculations, while the verger delivered fresh candles and the key to the bell stairs. [503]
Some nights, thunder formed without rain, and I painted its expectancy as a dark petal cupped to the ear. [522]
In spring the garden awoke in pockets, trumpet flowers spilling perfume that drifted up the nave like a nocturne. [541]
Through the hidden layers, I learned how air itself choreographs desire, a set of eddies that only moonlight completes. [560]
Night blooming, then, was not rebellion but courtship, a schedule kept with distant partners who wake in the dark. [579]
Summer passed, rich and slow, and the mural gathered a sheen as if breath were drying on it. [597]
On the first day of the fair, when the town raised the amber pavilion in autumn light, I carried my final panel there. [620]
The pavilion was a ribbed shell of honey glass and larch, and the air inside tasted of resin and apples. [640]
I set the panel where sun would sink through amber into the etched cathedral scenes I had copied and transformed. [660]
When dusk found us, the whole pavilion held a dawning hush, a felt pause as if the fair inhaled to sing. [681]
Moths arrived from the river and circled the panels, reading them the way my grandmother once read weather on skin. [701]
Children pointed, their fingers gloved in sugar, and old men nodded, reckoning the patience it took to coax such glow. [721]
The verger stood beside me and placed a final postcard in my hand, one I had not known existed. [740]
It was from my grandmother on her last tour, and it depicted a flower opening under the amber pavilion long before its first fair. [764]
She had written, When you paint this place, you will understand why night is the gentlest daylight we have. [783]
Standing there, I felt her hand steady mine, and I knew my murals were doors. [798]</story>
