<story>On the orchard island adrift in a swirling maelstrom, I practice my craft with dissonant calm. <words>16</words>
I am a critical midwife, openly secretive, for the storms respect honesty that admits to its veils. <words>33</words>
Tonight, under a waxing moon's glow, the trees lean like listeners along the soaked terraces. <words>48</words>
I carry pressed herbs in a tin, their scent a ledger of births, losses, and faint recoveries. <words>65</words>
Someone has stolen my memories of the first child I saved, so I walk to the abandoned house to recover them. <words>86</words>
The hearth there gapes like a toothless mouth, and inside it I find half-burned diaries, still warm. <words>103</words>
I will travel through half-burned diaries found in a fireplace, as though their ash were a narrow road. <words>121</words>
I open the first, pressed herbs tucked between its singed pages, each leaf a small green witness. <words>138</words>
A name rises like steam, then a laugh, then a scream, and the orchard wind balances them without choosing. <words>157</words>
I keep my pulse steady, critical even with myself, counting breaths as if they were stitches. <words>173</words>
This island raises fruit from brine and lightning, and I have learned growing wisdom from its contradictions. <words>190</words>
In the diary margin, a sketch of a moon tilting like a bowl spills silver over a midwife with my hands. <words>211</words>
A page later, I see the infant's face drawn as a seed, and I feel a theft as clear as tide. <words>232</words>
The father had feared the maelstrom and paid a whispering adept to pry memories loose so I would never judge him. <words>253</words>
He did not know how openly secretive I am, how I wear my mysteries like lanterns in fog. <words>271</words>
I turn the crumbling book and rub the pressed herbs into my pulse points, coaxing scent to bridge the torn places. <words>292</words>
The room hums, the island shudders, and yet a calm descends, not gentle, but dissonant like two choirs arguing. <words>311</words>
I step inside the memory and watch myself deliver the child, watch the father cry, and then watch hands steal the scene away. <words>334</words>
Anger is a helpful midwife too, but I keep it swaddled, because only clarity can fit through the narrowest breach. <words>354</words>
I rewrite the scene by breathing, and the diary blisters, then cools, and the stolen memory settles like rain. <words>373</words>
The father returns to me in that settled rain, confession trembling beside relief, and we both transcend our smallness. <words>392</words>
He learns how to hold the child without bargaining, and I learn how to forgive without forgetting. <words>409</words>
The moon climbs, my wisdom keeps growing, and the maelstrom drifts a fraction farther from our roots. <words>426</words>
I return the diaries to the fireplace, not to burn but to warm, so pages curl into listening rather than smoke. <words>447</words>
On this orchard island, under a waxing moon's glow, I keep records in ash and fruit, and they keep me. <words>467</words>
Tomorrow I will walk the terraces again, openly secretive, and the calm will stay dissonant until wisdom ripens completely. <words>486</words></story>
