After the final chord in an abandoned music hall, I followed the echo into the abandoned mess hall. <words>18</words>
I am a social media exorcist, indifferent enthusiasm my default mode, trending hauntings my reluctant beat. <words>34</words>
Ghosts here prefer comments to candles, their demands quietly loud, their profiles crusted with grief. <words>49</words>
I came to feed curiosity with life's raw edge, not to cross anyone over gently. <words>64</words>
The mess hall still smelled of iron and oranges, a soldier's breakfast merged with a bassist's sweat. <words>81</words>
On the cracked table I found an old grocery receipt, names and prices smudged like fingerprints. <words>97</words>
It listed milk, aspirin, sage, and a nondescript brand of silence that rang in my teeth. <words>113</words>
I posted the receipt to my followers, asking who remembered this store and why the total trembled. <words>130</words>
Replies poured in like rain through broken panes, a chorus of familiar strangers tagging former selves. <words>146</words>
They said the receipt belonged to a drummer who vanished, and to a cook who never stopped listening. <words>164</words>
The hall had been both barracks and ballroom, kitchen and cathedral, depending on whose hunger led. <words>180</words>
To reignite their trail, I did what I always do, by infiltrating secret clubs in alleyways. <words>196</words>
The alleys converged behind the mess hall like staff lines, and the city wrote its own score. <words>213</words>
Inside a door painted blackout blue, a hush boomed, quietly loud, and everyone spoke in borrowed names. <words>230</words>
The bartender slid me another receipt, identical ink, identical crease, but the items rearranged like notes. <words>246</words>
Milk moved to coda, sage to prelude, aspirin to bridge, as if purchase could compose survival. <words>262</words>
A woman with drumstick tattoos asked if I could untag a house from a bad memory. <words>278</words>
I told her houses keep their own accounts, but we can reconcile what we carry into them. <words>295</words>
Indifferent enthusiasm does not mean I do not care; it means I keep the feed moving. <words>311</words>
I streamed the bar's murmur, asked the strangers to tag themselves if they felt haunted, live. <words>327</words>
The screen filled with silhouettes who knew the drummer, knew the cook, knew the receipt's quivering arithmetic. <words>344</words>
Together we mapped losses onto the mess hall floor, each total balanced by a story finally spoken. <words>361</words>
Some wanted heavens; I offered signal strength, a place where grief could buffer without disappearing. <words>376</words>
In the dark, the receipts aligned like sheet music, and the room began to practice remembering. <words>392</words>
When we returned to the stage, the silence held a final, final chord, and no one fled. <words>409</words>
I folded the receipt into a metronome, and curiosity ticked on, an honest, tireless little engine. <words>425</words>
The strangers felt familiar because we chose one rhythm, and its beat threaded us through separate rooms. <words>442</words>
Outside, the alley clubs exhaled, and the city, quietly loud, agreed to keep listening with me. <words>458</words>
