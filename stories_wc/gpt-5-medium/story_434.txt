Between whispered confessions, I cue the red light and become the lonely ringleader of our unseen, unruly audience. <words>18</words>
The ghost story recording booth is padded like a coffin, yet lined with mirrors that pretend to be possible exits. <words>38</words>
I swab spit from the pop filter with a stained napkin inherited from my grandmother's impossible carnival. <words>55</words>
On its browned corner, she stitched a warning that reads less like a rule and more like ancestral wisdom. <words>74</words>
Guard the inexplicable artifact; it will guard you, if you keep entertaining what wishes to end the show. <words>92</words>
Tonight the artifact looks like a moth trapped in amber, but it hums with a voice I cannot credit. <words>111</words>
It sits on the desk between the condenser microphone and a brass candle that floats, deliberately tethered, to simulate zero gravity. <words>132</words>
In the headphones, callers confess in murmurs, their stories commonly individual, yet braiding into one stalking thing. <words>149</words>
I am their circus master of silence, cracking a phantom whip that sounds like a breath caught shy of laughter. <words>169</words>
But something else is listening, occupying the gaps between confessions like cold swallowed on a dare. <words>185</words>
When the ON AIR sign hiccups, the candle wobbles, and the flame turns into a bead, dancing without direction. <words>204</words>
Grandmother taught me to outmaneuver predators by the dance of a flame in zero gravity, reading appetite from oscillations. <words>223</words>
A lazy sway means mischief; a sudden stillness means hunger without hesitation; a spiral means the past waking up angry. <words>243</words>
Tonight the flame performs a child's game, spinning, freezing, then bowing as if inviting me to curtsy back. <words>261</words>
I tilt the stained napkin over the bead of fire, and the embroidery drinks heat like a spotted tongue. <words>280</words>
The artifact thrums, wanting center stage, a tiny pulsing stone that feeds on attention, as the callers keep whispering. <words>299</words>
If I falter, the show ends, and my booth becomes a reliquary for a hunger that pretends to be history. <words>319</words>
So I play, hurrying the next confession, teasing details, letting the artifact overheat on longing until the flame steadies. <words>338</words>
The bead grows calm, which means the predator has remembered my name and is, for now, embarrassed by familiarity. <words>357</words>
I whisper my grandmother's stage patter, a ridiculous lullaby about tickets, lions, and the applause of well-behaved ghosts. <words>375</words>
The callers laugh through tears, thinking I mean them, while the artifact cools and folds its hum like a tent. <words>395</words>
Between whispered confessions, I sign the log, ringleader and custodian, witness to what won't translate. <words>410</words>
The booth exhales foam and neon, playful dread diffused like cologne dabbed at a fatal pulse. <words>426</words>
I guard the inexplicable artifact, and it guards me, until the lights drop, and the dance begins again. <words>444</words>
