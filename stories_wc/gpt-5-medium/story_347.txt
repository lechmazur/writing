<story>Inside the perpetual motion workshop, I pose as a machinist while listening to the breaths of fern and ivy hidden in the rafters. <words>23</words>
Time dilates within the space of a thought experiment, and every wheel imagines itself already spinning forever, even as the dust chooses where to settle. <words>48</words>
I am an undercover plant whisperer, singularly multiple because I am root and rumor, engineer and heretic, tasked with protecting the green grammar of momentum. <words>73</words>
My cover holds while I seek the last piece of the puzzle: a seed that can teach the machine to breathe without theft. <words>96</words>
A loose shoelace drags like an omen near the flywheel, graceless beauty dangling from my boot, threatening to reveal me with a single foolish stumble. <words>121</words>
The master builder tunes the bearings with the melody of a violin string breaking, a brittle pitch that tells the metals how to remember friction. <words>146</words>
At that note, the ferns constrict their coils in the rafters, and I hear their breath turn from lullaby to warning inside my teeth. <words>170</words>
To speak back, I pretend to measure torque while my pulse answers in chlorophyll syntax, knowing this risky dialogue will be judged as a test of faith. <words>197</words>
The missing piece is not metal but a seed capsule, singularly multiple, holding many futures in one husk, capable of splitting and staying whole, like time behaved. <words>224</words>
I must nest the capsule in the governor, but my loose shoelace kisses a gear, daring me to choose between secrecy and survival before the wheel inhales. <words>251</words>
Graceless beauty saves me; I yank the lace free and loop it around a pulley, and the entire assembly pauses like a chest holding back a cough. <words>278</words>
In that held breath, I slide the capsule into the governor's heart and whisper the drought memory that teaches roots to sip time rather than swallow. <words>304</words>
I pluck a tension wire with the melody of a violin string breaking, and the workshop answers in shivers that travel through bolts, leaves, and bone. <words>330</words>
The machine tries to sprint into forever, but the seed's logic makes the ferns constrict like belts, breathing the wheel into a cadence of give and take. <words>357</words>
The master builder sees the pause and suspects sabotage, yet I steady my shaking hands, accepting that true motion is a test of faith between hunger and restraint. <words>385</words>
I offer him results instead of confessions; the wheel moves, stops, moves again, singularly multiple in its cycles, a graceless beauty learning when to refuse eternity. <words>411</words>
Within the space of a thought experiment that feels like a lifetime, I find the last piece of the puzzle in the loosened knot of my own secrecy. <words>439</words></story>
