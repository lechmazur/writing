I arrived at the collapsed cathedral turned street artist's haven during the slow fade of an echoing hour, my hands unsteady, my purpose steadier than it had any right to be. <words>31</words>
They called me a shaky mercenary, the kind who twitches before drawing, but I had come for something no trigger could aim at. <words>54</words>
I had followed a citywide breadcrumb trail of paint flecks and whispers, pieced together through improbable rumor chains that seemed to stitch alleys into a single vulnerable vein. <words>82</words>
The rumor said the cathedral walls, cracked like old knuckles, hid an altar that appeared only when someone asked the right question without knowing the answer they wanted. <words>110</words>
I carried my own relic, a chunk of amber with a trapped spider, ancient terror fixed in honeyed light, a motionless compass toward the unknown I had refused to name. <words>140</words>
Carefully reckless, I set the amber in a chalk circle among spray cans and bucketed pigments, listening as rain ticked through ribs of the missing roof like a weary metronome. <words>170</words>
Street artists ghosted around me, their masks paint-smeared and priestly, and one nodded, as if blessing a confession they had been waiting their whole imprecise lives to hear. <words>198</words>
I asked the wall, not the people, how to make peace with the past, and a draft rose, temperate as forgiveness, carrying the smell of varnish, ash, and wet limestone. <words>228</words>
The echoing hour thinned like breath on glass, and I saw my own outline climb the nave and dissolve into a mural of desert storms and broken contracts and a house that never stood. <words>262</words>
Someone whispered that the altar had changed into a shuttered confessional of brick and ivy, and there, framed by drips, lay a ledger waiting for a name I feared to write. <words>293</words>
I did not kneel; I steadied, then signed, intending to finalize the admission that the unknown I chased was not treasure, nor target, but the me that remained after recoil. <words>323</words>
The ledger bled into the plaster, turning the wall into a slow-breathing archive, and the spider inside the amber seemed to flex a leg, as if testing thawed time. <words>352</words>
I felt my shaking as a map, not a malfunction, each tremor tracing routes between names I had used and debts I had dodged, all returning to the nave's luminous wound. <words>383</words>
Carefully reckless again, I lifted the amber and pressed it against the mural heart, letting resin kiss pigment, and the spider's shadow scuttled outward across deserts, into alleys, toward a door. <words>414</words>
I followed, not to conquer it, but to keep pace with it, because searching for the unknown means walking beside your fear until it chooses you back with improbable longing. <words>444</words>
When the hour finally exhaled, the artists sealed the ledger into the wall with a hush, and the cathedral held, and I left lighter, not finished, but somehow more final. <words>474</words>
