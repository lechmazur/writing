After the last photo is snapped in a deserted hallway, I accept work as an unsettled guide for the only pilgrim still willing to walk with me toward the water. <words>30</words>
He carries a wooden puzzle box that clicks like a patient clock, and says the beach holds architectural secrets no city ever allowed to breathe. <words>55</words>
We arrive at a giant seashell on a deserted beach, its ridges spiraling like frozen thunder, its mouth big enough for us to step through, leaving our footprints hesitant and close. <words>86</words>
Inside, I feel the prophecy that hunts me, a rumor given teeth by archivists, and I tell the pilgrim our goal is simple and monstrous: to outrun an unstoppable prophecy. <words>116</words>
He answers with sharp gentleness, promising not salvation, only company, and sets the box between us on nacre that reflects our faces like moonlit maps of error and hope. <words>145</words>
The seashell hums, a corridor of pearled ribs, and the pilgrim explains its chambers were designed by exiled architects whose best buildings had to hide in tide and salt to survive. <words>176</words>
They folded architectural secrets into the shell like prayers, he says, so that anyone desperate enough could unlock a path away from what insists on coming. <words>202</words>
I study the puzzle box, noticing its faces are blistered with tiny beveled arrows that refuse to align until you think backward, as though the future listens only through reversed wishes. <words>233</words>
My hands remember the hallway, the camera flash, the archivists demanding proof that I was leading people into disaster, and I remember saying I was only leading them out. <words>262</words>
Together we turn the box so the arrows point against themselves, and panels sigh, revealing shells within shells, each layer asking a question I cannot ignore without becoming smaller. <words>291</words>
The last chamber opens to a blueprint etched in mother of pearl, a map of the seashell itself, but the routes spiral outward into dunes, wind, and something brighter than chance. <words>322</words>
The pilgrim asks who I am when nobody needs a guide, and the prophecy growls in memory, and I answer that I am an unsettled guide because I keep moving beside fear. <words>354</words>
He laughs like sand being sifted, then ties the blueprint to my wrist with eelgrass, saying accident is just courage that refuses to announce itself, and we step deeper into the resonant shell. <words>387</words>
When the shell groans, we align our footsteps to the echo, and a passage opens where there was wall, a door that answers the prophecy by going everywhere at once except backward. <words>419</words>
I am accidentally heroic only because the door insists on me, and as we walk out into night, the beach erases our names, leaving a quiet path no archivist will photograph. <words>450</words>
