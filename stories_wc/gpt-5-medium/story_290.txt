After the last empire crumbles, the rain remembers the sound of marching feet. <words>13</words>
I sit in a shared taxi during a torrential downpour, watching gutters turn into silver snakes. <words>29</words>
The driver hums a folk scale that wobbles like a compass needle seeking the harmonic caves. <words>45</words>
I am a bored shapeshifter, and boredom is the most dangerous skin I wear. <words>59</words>
When the empires vanished, so did their noise, leaving me alone with my rare talents and a too-quiet world. <words>78</words>
To shift the cosmic balance of power, you need nerve, music, and something heartbreakingly small. <words>93</words>
In my pocket rattles a chipped figurine of a hollow-eyed queen, the last budget idol of a fallen court. <words>112</words>
She broke the day the capital burned, and her missing shard fits where my heart tries not to. <words>130</words>
The taxi coughs through floodwater while strangers argue about who rules nothing now. <words>143</words>
I tell them power abhors emptiness, and emptiness will overwrite us unless we overwrite it first. <words>159</words>
They laugh at my intelligently foolish plan, yet no one gets out when I ask for the caves. <words>177</words>
We reach the basalt mouth where the rain becomes percussion and stalactites tune the dark. <words>192</words>
Harmonic caves amplify what you dare to be, and I intend to be a quiet overthrow wearing noise. <words>210</words>
I pay the fare with empire coins that look like regrets, and the others follow as if debts called them. <words>230</words>
Inside, the air trembles, reading our bones like instruments left in a storeroom too long. <words>245</words>
I set the chipped figurine on a mineral shelf and shift into the shape of her missing shard. <words>263</words>
In that sliver form, I slip into her, and the queen wakes not as a person but as a chord. <words>283</words>
The taxi strangers hold hands, rare talents answering the cave: a forger hum, a healer click, a mapmaker whistling latitude. <words>303</words>
Our noise stacks into architecture, measured wildness rising like scaffolding around the ruin of the sky. <words>319</words>
I sing the queen a path of return, intelligently foolish because return means invention, not restoration. <words>335</words>
Outside, the flood accepts a new tempo and carries weapons gently to sleep beneath silt. <words>350</words>
The caves answer with overtones that draft laws without princes, a parliament of echoes convened. <words>365</words>
By the last note, I am neither shard nor queen, only a hinge where futures pivot. <words>381</words>
We have not toppled a throne so much as taught silence to share its chair, and the balance tilts. <words>400</words>
The strangers bow not to me but to the rumor we made, then take the taxi back into the storm. <words>420</words>
I pocket the figurine, edges softened, and step into new boredom, a patient watch at the hinge. <words>437</words>
Tonight we overthrow absence, not people, because vacuums hoard more crowns than kings ever did. <words>452</words>
