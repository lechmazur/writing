In the capsule hotel for time travelers, I lay awake amid the calm that settles before a crucial test. <words>19</words>
I am a dutiful scholar, trained to shepherd histories rather than desire them. <words>32</words>
Tomorrow's examination will certify my access to the archives or banish me to compiling glossaries of sanctioned myths. <words>50</words>
Yet tonight my resolve beats like an unspoken heart that aches to let a forbidden tale be told. <words>68</words>
Under my pillow waits a small wire coil, scavenged from a broken recorder left by some future tourist. <words>86</words>
With it I can tune the vents to carry words by the echo of a voice in an old well. <words>106</words>
The hotel breathes in stacked corridors, each capsule a shuttered seed, and the walls keep the dust of centuries calm. <words>126</words>
Pilgrims of tomorrow sleep around me with headsets dangling and passports that list birthdays not yet risked. <words>143</words>
I have been called uncommonly typical, the sort of candidate the bureau trusts because my habits are unadorned. <words>161</words>
But no habit protects the mind once it hears the hush of a story begging not for silence but for air. <words>182</words>
I thread the coil through the capsule grate, a humble antenna for contraband memory. <words>196</words>
The test will ask me to erase discrepancies from any oral history that might contaminate the clean line of endorsed time. <words>217</words>
I intend to fail correctly, to make failure a corridor, to pass the tale through the vents before they close. <words>237</words>
The tale belongs to my grandmother, who walked through a famine and traded her wedding spoon for seeds that would not sprout. <words>259</words>
Officials call it apocrypha because no ledger records such grief, and grief without ink embarrasses their machines. <words>276</words>
I cup my hands to the little coil and speak in a hush meant for stone, hoping the ducts answer like a well. <words>299</words>
I tell of the spoon with the notch where a vow once rested, and of the seeds that slept until her tears warmed them. <words>323</words>
The vents return a tremor, a resonance that is not my voice alone, as if the hotel remembers its own hunger. <words>344</words>
By the echo of a voice in an old well, the coil hums, and the capsules thrum like patient drums. <words>364</words>
Sleepers stir, and I sense their unspoken hearts turning earward, a soft and earthbound flight of listening. <words>381</words>
The test will come, but a murmur already wanders the corridors, tagging the air with a permission older than policy. <words>401</words>
I will sign what they place before me, dutiful in posture, yet carrying the tremble of this night like contraband sunlight. <words>422</words>
No seal resets a conscience once it has learned to breathe, and tonight I learned from an echo how to inhale. <words>443</words>
If they question the hum in the registers, I will call it interference, the harmless noise of travelers slipping past one another. <words>465</words>
But we who listened will know a well has opened in the air, and it will not close when morning knocks. <words>486</words>
