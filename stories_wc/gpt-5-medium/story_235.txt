<story>On the lacquered veranda of an ancient Japanese castle reimagined, I teach art classes to travelers who prefer silence over spectacle. <words>21</words>
They think I am only their remote herbalist, a shadow on the edge of campus, gathering mists and leaves instead of praise. <words>43</words>
But I enroll among them, sketchbook open, because I want to provoke an unspoken conversation that pigment alone cannot voice. <words>63</words>
My pressed flower book rests beside charcoal, its pages mapping scars of seasons, a soft atlas that refuses to heal too quickly. <words>85</words>
Each afternoon throughout art classes, I reposition petals between blotting papers, the way a surgeon rehearses empathy with steady, invisible hands. <words>106</words>
The students notice the ritual, dramatically subtle, as if a shrine bell were rung from underwater, its tremor raveling through their sketches. <words>128</words>
At night the castle displays constellations on its white walls, projections curated by the dean, but the sky still outwits the machine. <words>150</words>
I climb a turret where wind braids cedar smoke, and I read the heavens via decoding patterns in ephemeral meteor showers. <words>171</words>
The streaks tell me where to search for particular leaves, which pigments to brew, and which griefs will visit the studio tomorrow. <words>193</words>
I collect them early, before voices harden, and steep them so lightly that the tinctures taste like late rain on dark silk. <words>215</words>
When class begins, I pass small vials to students whose gestures tremble, asking them to paint landscapes inside their breathing. <words>235</words>
They sip courage from the rim, and their lines begin to confess how ink and absence are intertwined fates, tangled but tender. <words>257</words>
In return, I let them open my pressed flower book, where a peony flattens like a moon it took years to set. <words>279</words>
They notice a margin note, smudged with resin, that reads, Do not heal the wound that still knows how to listen. <words>300</words>
No one speaks, but our silence wraps the room like indigo cloth, accepting what cannot be washed from the grain of wood. <words>322</words>
That evening, a meteor grazes the eave and vanishes, and I understand the message: rearrange the seating, realign the distance. <words>342</words>
Next day I reposition easels so former strangers face each other, while I drift between them like steam escaping tea, barely seen. <words>364</words>
They keep painting, but their glances knock gently, and a corridor opens between pupils, long enough for a question to cross. <words>385</words>
I step back, letting the castle rafters whisper, and the walls show quiet constellations of breath, a choreography finished by looking. <words>406</words>
One student paints the outline of her grandmother using only empty space, and another lifts a wash that resembles thawed frost on armor. <words>429</words>
In their near-silence, I hear the conversation I wanted: a slow exchange of trust, passing from knuckle to pigment to air. <words>450</words>
It moves through them with distant intimacy, like tidewater threading stones without claiming them. <words>464</words>
By nightfall, our intertwined fates lie pressed between pages like petals, awaiting the next shower to tell us where to turn. <words>485</words>
