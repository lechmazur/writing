He arrived when the orchard dog finally stops barking at night, like a clock that forgives lateness, then whispers hurry. <words>20</words>
In the dinosaur skeleton museum at night, ribs arched like ship keels, the air held old dust and clicking exit signs. <words>41</words>
He was a gentle swordsman who never drew steel, preferring apologies honed to a thin edge and folded into silence. <words>61</words>
He had come to cradle the universe in a cupped hand, or at least the star maps rumored to nest beneath the tyrannosaur. <words>84</words>
In his pocket rattled an empty matchbox, a promise that he would light nothing he could not also carry gently. <words>104</words>
The night curator, faithfully unfaithful to any single truth, met him with brusque affection, as if scolding a favored comet. <words>124</words>
She was a xenophile of relics, loving whatever came from elsewhere, bone caravans, sailor teeth, stray meteor pebbles in umbrella stands. <words>145</words>
Together they read where to begin via the coded angles in a half-painted sundial bolted to the paleoclimatology wing. <words>164</words>
It was a guide for late bloomers, pointing not at noon but at patient corners, where finished things waited for finally noticing. <words>186</words>
The bones stretched like constellations with vertebrae for stars, and he traced them softly, naming routes with the calm of rainfall. <words>207</words>
As a child he bloomed late, sword lessons arriving long after bruises, and patience became the scabbard he never needed to draw. <words>229</words>
Now he chased a rumor that the skeletons, assembled from foreign epochs, could teach a hand to hold everything without breaking. <words>250</words>
The curator wanted the same, though she admitted it bluntly, saying hearts are museums that charge admission to keep the lights on. <words>272</words>
They tilted the sundial's half-painted face toward the ribcage, and shadows fell into seams, opening a hatch beneath the floor. <words>292</words>
He placed the empty matchbox in the socket that asked for fire, proving gentleness by offering the outline of a flame instead. <words>314</words>
The floor sighed, stairs unfurled, and down they walked into a chamber where ceiling projectors stitched galaxies from vertebral gaps. <words>334</words>
He cupped his hand under the light, and the galaxy perched there, weightless as dust, sudden as forgiveness, exactly as enormous as hope. <words>357</words>
The gentle swordsman trembled, faithfully unfaithful to despair, because loving everything meant betraying any one grief that asked for custody. <words>377</words>
The curator clicked her tongue, brusque affection hiding relief, and told him to stop shaking before he spilled starlight on the fossils. <words>399</words>
He steadied, a late bloomer in the act of arrival, and together they mapped new kindnesses for strangers, a disciplined xenophile's chart. <words>421</words>
Above, the orchard dog finally stopped barking for good, and the museum breathed like a living thing promising to keep the lights gentle. <words>444</words>
He pocketed the matchbox again, still empty, proof that he could leave some fires unlit and still walk home warm. <words>464</words>
