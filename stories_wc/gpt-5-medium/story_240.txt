I keep my stall under the oldest roots of our gnarled forest village perched in twisted branches. <words>17</words>
People climb down like tired spiders, trading trinkets for glimpses of tomorrow that I weigh with dreadful hope. <words>35</words>
I am a pragmatic soothsayer, lavishly humble because prophecy is a market where vanity ruins the goods. <words>52</words>
The only luxury I permit is honesty, and the only ritual I trust is repetition. <words>67</words>
We manufacture what others call fate. <words>73</words>
Here, manufactured miracles are built from failed attempts and small payments, practically hammered into shape by need. <words>90</words>
My favorite tool is not a crystal, but a blacksmith's hammer passed from a vanished forge to my keeping. <words>109</words>
Its weight is a memory that thunders softer than weather yet steadier than remorse. <words>123</words>
I strike the table, and the reverberations arrange tea leaves, bones, and crumbs into maps no cartographer could sketch. <words>142</words>
By the echo of a long-forgotten song, the hammer sings back, aligning the future with the grain of the wood. <words>162</words>
The village listens from the branches, hushed and greedy, each heart a cup held out for rain. <words>179</words>
A child brings me a knot of bark shaped like a jawbone and asks how to become a force of nature. <words>200</words>
I hear the corridor of memory open, a cold hallway where absent fires refuse to die. <words>216</words>
Across the hush of memory's corridors, I see the child grown, storm-eyed, making promises to lightning and debt to ash. <words>236</words>
I tell them that to become weather, you must first carry water, then burn, then spare what you can. <words>255</words>
They nod, lavishly humble in their hunger, and offer me two buttons and a thorn. <words>270</words>
I take the hammer and manufacture a lesson, not in words but in the choreography of echoes. <words>287</words>
Three taps for patience, two for loss, one for the dangerous sweetness of success; the table hums and the bark jaw smiles. <words>309</words>
Manufactured miracles do not descend like doves; they arrive like debts, and the collector is always time. <words>326</words>
I warn the child that each storm demands a ledger, written in trees that remember every cut. <words>343</words>
They agree, and the village breathes a branch-creak of relief, because someone has chosen the hard road. <words>360</words>
I hand them the hammer, heavy as a sky pregnant with weather, and the long-forgotten song finds their grip. <words>379</words>
When they strike, the echo climbs the tree-ways, wakes shutters, and trails like breath on glass across every future. <words>398</words>
I hear the storm arrive in their chest, a small, dreadful hope turning like a key. <words>414</words>
Around us, the branches bow as if to bless the manufacture of what will finally remake us. <words>431</words>
