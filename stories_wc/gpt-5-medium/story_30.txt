<story>I was a high-stakes gambler with telekinetic dice, hired to chart a stolen orchard's return from the space pirate navigation room. <words>21</words>
They thought I would nudge probability toward plunder, but my motive was quieter, to preserve farming methods that my mother swore could feed comets. <words>45</words>
Amid whispered secrets, I set my dice spinning, each cube levitating like a modest planet awaiting a nudge of unseen wind. <words>66</words>
The room reeked of ozone and rumor, a sacred disorder of charts, contraband seeds, and prayers smuggled between star maps. <words>86</words>
I unrolled my talisman, a fragment of a medieval tapestry showing dragons whose emerald backs hid furrows, terraces, and ancient irrigation knots. <words>108</words>
Its threads spoke in lost languages of soil and stars, proving that a field is also a clock if you learn its grammar. <words>131</words>
Philosophically practical, I treated myth as manual, aligning the helm to constellations the dragons once grazed, where rain-trails braided like pilgrim belts. <words>153</words>
A blue flame flickered in a cracked brazier, warming a jar of heritage beans we carried like contraband scripture. <words>172</words>
Each bean held the memory of droughts and songs, syllables of weather kept in starch, conjugations only the land could translate. <words>193</words>
The pirates wanted coordinates to planets where soil lay sleeping in vaults, but I had sworn a family tradition of planting a tree for each new member. <words>220</words>
To plant, we first must arrive alive, so I palmed the telekinetic dice and tuned their fall to the tapestry's hidden furrows. <words>242</words>
They landed in a cadence that trimmed our route through nebular squalls, the numbers a vernacular the ship understood better than spoken fear. <words>265</words>
The captain, scarred like a vineyard after harvest, asked why a gambler risked fortune on farming, and I answered with soil under my tongue. <words>289</words>
Because fields survive empires, I said, and lost languages keep them honest, every root a syllable, every ditch a sentence against famine. <words>311</words>
He laughed like cut rope, then whispered coordinates learned from raiders of monasteries where monks brewed compost and copied rainfall, promises bartered amid whispered secrets. <words>336</words>
Together we plotted a course that dodged patrols and ice, tracing dragon backs across stars until the bean jar hummed like a hive. <words>359</words>
When the planet finally rose, its continents shaped like folded wings, we descended with our charts, our seeds, and the unrolled dragon sermon. <words>382</words>
I placed the brazier on new soil and coaxed the flame as we read the tapestry aloud, translating furrow after furrow into living syntax. <words>406</words>
The pirates became planters, their tattoos dusted with loam, their curses softened into proverbs that mapped moisture and patience. <words>425</words>
I wagered the last toss, letting the dice click like rain, and staked my winnings on terraces spiraling outward like rings of a remembering tree. <words>450</words>
Under stars and dragons, in sacred disorder, we translated hunger into harvest, and the world replied in a language only the living can keep. <words>474</words></story>
