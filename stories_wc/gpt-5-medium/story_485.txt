Storms bullied the surface while, far below, a forgotten underwater city laboratory exhaled bubbles like prayers, and I descended to it amid social upheaval. <words>24</words>
I was a brazen raider with manners borrowed from shipwreck glass, edges bright, intentions unclear, pockets heavy with borrowed time and debts I intended to repay. <words>50</words>
I had come to shelter the flame of a faltering genius who once taught me to breathe calmly inside panic and to speak softly around unstable fire. <words>77</words>
Even the corridors hummed with echoes of betrayal, as if the metal remembered every contract broken and whispered names into the brackish current. <words>100</words>
Impulsively thoughtful, I paused before each door, counting barnacle grins like rosary beads, gambling instinct against memory, never sure which prayer might unlock a safer ruin. <words>126</words>
In my palm lay a piece of charcoal sealed from the wet, a relic from cook fires and school slates, stubborn, blunt, and loyal to truth. <words>152</words>
My plan was to warn her by revisiting youthful superstitions, sketching protective symbols on bulkheads the way our village mothers warded nets against jealous ghosts. <words>177</words>
The uprising above had torched archives and tongues, and she had fled downward, bright mind flickering, hunted by sponsors who preferred obedience to discovery. <words>201</words>
The laboratory was a cathedral of drowned hypotheses, jars of salted light floating in rows, doors crusted with salt like old teeth, instruments sleeping inside algae veils. <words>228</words>
I pressed charcoal to glass and traced circles within circles, the fisher trick that confused predatory spirits, then scrawled her childhood nickname to guide her trembling stride. <words>255</words>
Once, she had sold my compass to purchase rare seeds, promising return, and the currents took me in circles for years, learning austerity from endless blue. <words>281</words>
And still I came, because her fire lit currents no map predicted, because genius falters under knives, and because vengeance tastes thin beside the breath of wonder. <words>308</words>
A tremor ran through the pylons, and the laboratory moaned like a violin dropped, telling me saboteurs had found a seam, telling me to vanish or finish. <words>335</words>
I chose finish, and kicked a corroded grate, brazen in noise, then slipped through pipes into the heart room where she hunched over a coughing reactor. <words>361</words>
I smeared the last sigil on the console and whispered the rhyme about salt, saints, and shoes, the one that warns of knives hidden in applause. <words>387</words>
She looked up with fractured grace, eyes fever bright, hands shaking like rigging, and admitted the patrons who financed her ruins had followed her to finish their ownership. <words>415</words>
Together we rerouted brine to flood the false corridors, left charcoal names as decoys, and I warned her again, do not trust applause, trust ballast and breath. <words>442</words>
The city sighed as we sealed the submersible, leaving behind the echoes of betrayal to settle like silt, while I sheltered her flickering flame within my stubborn chest. <words>470</words>
