I am an alchemist living in a suburban home, clinging to desperate hope as I try to decode my grandmother's cipher. <words>21</words>
Her letters told me to begin at the hour a butterfly emerges from its chrysalis, and to carry the scuffed coin she left under the breadbox. <words>47</words>
On the coin, a faint pattern of towers and vines hinted at webs of kinship I had barely understood in our tidy cul-de-sac. <words>70</words>
I resolved to investigate by following what she called a regularly organic rhythm, small rituals performed like breaths, each inviting the next. <words>92</words>
First I polished the kitchen kettle until my face swam in it, then I brewed chamomile and left a cup on the sill for the neighborhood stray. <words>119</words>
The cat leapt, brushed the coin, and the radio flicked on, whispering a road name I had never noticed, drawing me through chain-reactive coincidences toward the edge of town. <words>148</words>
There, beyond trimmed hedges and discount malls, rose a nest of watchtowers guarding a boiling tar pit, their scaffolds knitting shadows like barbed thread. <words>172</words>
My grandmother used to call such places the heart-labs, where the city poured its refuse and our family stirred it into medicines and warnings. <words>196</words>
At the fence, a caretaker eyed my coin and nodded, as if reminded of a vow older than the concrete, and unlatched a side gate. <words>221</words>
He led me along catwalks that trembled over the tar like drumheads, to a shack where moths flurried against a tarnished desk lamp. <words>244</words>
Inside, the walls were pinned with family charts, not trees but lattices, webs of kinship that spiraled around a single blank circle. <words>266</words>
I set the scuffed coin in the circle, and the lamp startled, its filament thrumming at the hour a butterfly emerges from its chrysalis. <words>290</words>
From the tar pit bubbled a smell like rain on copper, and I remembered the kettle, the cat, the road, the gate, each accident strangely necessary. <words>316</words>
I followed the lamp's hum with a tuning fork from my pocket, tracing tones across the charts until the lattices rearranged into letters only my hands could read. <words>344</words>
The message was a recipe and a map, a plea that our work remain regularly organic, never mechanized into instruments of harm, and signed with my grandmother's pantry nickname. <words>373</words>
Her cipher unlocked not gold but forgiveness: a way to distill treacheries into salves, to mend the feuds that had made our lattice brittle. <words>397</words>
The caretaker removed his cap, revealing the same cowlick as my uncle, and in that resemblance I saw the debt our webs of kinship had scattered across the borough. <words>426</words>
Together we decanted tar, mineral, and mint into vials, labeling each with a word of the message, promising to carry it home and keep investigating the mercies it proposed. <words>455</words>
As dawn tipped the tar black into bruised purple, the lamp guttered, and I closed my fist around the coin, warm now with a living purpose. <words>481</words>
