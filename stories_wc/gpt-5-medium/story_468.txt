<story>
When the night yields to golden embers, I arrive at the mangrove labyrinth inhabited by singing spirits, a politely anarchic hush-folded choir unscrolling the rustle of revelation above dark, patient waters. <words>31</words>
An overly curious mortician, I move with a loudly serene gait, here to collect dream journals whispered into bark and brine by sailors who drowned trying to chart their sleep. <words>61</words>
I wear a tarnished silver bracelet taken as payment from a widow who begged me to find her husband's last unwritten page, its links ringing like coins whenever the mangroves exhale. <words>92</words>
To navigate polite anarchy, I imitate the rituals of the dead, laying my tools on roots, bowing to the river's amber eye, and moving through footprints that vanish after a single heartbeat. <words>124</words>
The spirits sing in harmonies that sound like wet pages turning, and the rustle of revelation keeps time, urging me deeper where the roots braid into corridors and the channels echo with vanished oaths. <words>158</words>
I read the appearing prints as if they are annotations, heels italicizing fear, toes underlining desire, each instruction fading promptly, so I memorize their sequence before the heartbeat erases the syllabus. <words>189</words>
My trade taught me to ask questions of silent mouths, and my curiosity overruns decorum, because the dead keep the most meticulous dream journals, bound in hush and indigo, which I catalog for the living who forget. <words>226</words>
Tonight a specter shaped like a lanternfish surfaces, its song combing my pulse, and my tarnished bracelet warms, as though the widow's coin-silver remembers the husband's cadence and strikes a bell in my wrist. <words>260</words>
To coax the next entry, I imitate the husband's bedtime fussing, folding a reed mat, tapping three beats on a gourd, then reciting the oath of land-leavers, each gesture offered with undertakerly patience and sailorly humor. <words>296</words>
Footprints bloom along a sandbar like quicksilver lilies, then pale, but I keep pace and arrive beneath an arch of mangrove knees where a cache of words hangs in bottles, fogged by the breath of sleepers. <words>332</words>
I register each bottle as a journal, politely anarchic scribbles permitted to contradict themselves, and I am loudly serene as I unstopper one, letting its whisper draft my ledger while the choir hums wicked lullabies. <words>367</words>
Then the husband's voice tests my courage, promising to drown my curiosity in black honey unless I admit why a mortician stalks dawn; I answer that I gather what lives forget, so their dead can rest unargued. <words>404</words>
The spirits accept the terms with the rustle of revelation, and the bracelet sheds a fleck of tarnish, revealing a shy gleam as a last bottle drifts toward me, labeled with the widow's name and a tidechart. <words>441</words>
I leave along footprints that vanish after a single heartbeat, journals clinking with softly rebellious etiquette, and when the golden embers ascend I promise to return, an overly curious mortician serving polite anarchy with gentle precision. <words>477</words>
