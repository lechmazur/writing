During the hush of a dreamless night, the giant mushroom meeting hall exhaled a spore-soft sigh. <words>16</words>
I, a dry-tongued bard, had come alone with a stained glass prism cupped like a captive comet. <words>33</words>
Crisp languor draped the rafters of gills, and each breath tasted of cedar and slow thunder. <words>49</words>
Yet over my shoulders hung the cloak of doubt, stitched by years of applause that felt like snow on glass. <words>69</words>
I had come to escape the prison of the self, or at least widen its window. <words>85</words>
The plan was gorgeously awkward and simple: preserve my truest songs through forgotten voicemails, then smash the phone. <words>103</words>
In this hall where elders once negotiated rain, echoes kept better secrets than friends. <words>117</words>
I placed the prism atop the lectern, letting moonlight split into faithful shards that painted my knuckles with itinerant stained glass. <words>138</words>
The colors arranged themselves like counsel, stern, judicial, and also softly amused. <words>150</words>
I pressed record, and the voicemail tone peeped as if a chick hatched inside an hourglass. <words>166</words>
What came out of my mouth was not music but a ledger of nights, each entry a breadcrumb spared from the fox of forgetting. <words>190</words>
I spoke of the tavern where silence paid my tab, of a mother who named storms like pets, of the city that whistled me hollow. <words>215</words>
The prism transformed every syllable into a tribunal of light, and the hall nodded in spores and small consent. <words>234</words>
Through the glass I saw my face made strange, gorgeously awkward, as if carved by a patient river that distrusted mirrors. <words>255</words>
The cloak of doubt tugged at my throat, whispering that honesty is only hunger wearing manners. <words>271</words>
So I preserved the hunger, not the manners, and told the voicemail the secret of the bars between my ribs. <words>291</words>
I confessed how applause had taught me to rhyme my breath with other people's lungs, and how easy jail can feel when everyone praises its architecture. <words>317</words>
The message, one among many, would sleep in a server farm like seeds in permafrost, preserving a me I could not impersonate tomorrow. <words>340</words>
When the phone beeped done, the prism flared, and somewhere inside the crystal a corridor opened, unswept and inviting. <words>359</words>
I stepped toward it because the air behind me felt like the cell I had furnished with other people's dreams. <words>379</words>
The hall murmured approval in the language of dew, and my tongue, so long dry, found a sip of river. <words>399</words>
I did not shatter the phone; instead I left it recording on the lectern, so the corridor could keep hearing me leave, footstep by footstep, and preserve the vanishing. <words>428</words>
Outside, the night rebuttoned its coat, and the mushroom hall, relieved, exhaled again, this time in crisp languor I could finally breathe. <words>450</words>
