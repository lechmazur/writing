<story>When the final piece of evidence is filed away, the hesitant swordsman steps into the frigid tundra orchard dotted with geothermal vents. <words>22</words>
Steam drifts through the rows like pale banners, and his naturally awkward gait leaves zigzag prints between roots rimed with glassy frost. <words>44</words>
He carries a blank postcard as if it were a passport too shy to declare its country. <words>61</words>
The card waits for words, yet the mission that grips him demands silence, a bridge that can bear both thunder and doubt. <words>83</words>
He seeks to restore traditional systems the city archives dismantled, guild oaths and seed calendars and the old order of watering. <words>104</words>
His anger is a weathered blade, a tone of ephemeral rancor, sharp but fading each time he looks at the orchard's breath. <words>126</words>
The elders taught him to bridge worlds not with speeches but by the life of hermit crabs moving shells along hot rim pools. <words>149</words>
They said change your house, change your burden, and let your neighbors emerge beside you, each vessel remade yet kin to its earlier salt. <words>173</words>
Here the vents boil up small lagoons that never freeze, and tiny hermits parade like scribes that forgot their names and found them again. <words>197</words>
Watching them, he rehearses new footsteps for the sword he hardly draws, because skill is a dwelling he must enter with care. <words>219</words>
Across the orchard, a registrar waits with a lockbox of deeds that prove the guild's demise, sealed and cataloged beyond appeal. <words>240</words>
When the registrar turns away, he touches the blank postcard to the steam, and letters bead like frost reversed, messages from neither side alone. <words>264</words>
The card gathers vows, not written by him, but breathed, a treaty between vents and roots promising a return without erasing the present. <words>287</words>
He steps to the registrar with naturally awkward courtesy, bows once, and offers the card like a mirror that shows both of their fathers. <words>311</words>
The registrar studies it, sees the steam drawn orchard, the crabs procession, the sword held low, and the evidence box already ghosted. <words>333</words>
You filed the last piece, the swordsman says, yet evidence is only a shell, and shells are meant to be outgrown without being denied. <words>357</words>
His voice trembles, but the orchard listens, and the vents answer with a gentle hiss that sounds like many small feet crossing a threshold. <words>381</words>
Between them grows a plan to restore traditional systems as one restores a path, not by erasing footprints but by inviting more careful steps. <words>405</words>
The registrar returns the lockbox to the snow, the swordsman sheathes his doubt, and both agree to steward a guild that can change homes. <words>429</words>
As night settles, the postcard remains blank again, not from failure but from trust, a crossing kept open by the life that moves within. <words>453</words>
