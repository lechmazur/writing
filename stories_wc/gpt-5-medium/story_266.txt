At dawn, when the day's earliest train departs, a bleak clown unlocks the floating rock yoga studio. <words>17</words>
On the wall ticks a clock hand that won't stop spinning, a tiny storm he feeds with nervous breaths. <words>36</words>
His ambition, today again, is to outshine the northern lights with a grin, however chipped his paint. <words>53</words>
He practices jagged generosity, giving away ballooned apologies and keeping only the pins. <words>66</words>
Around him float drifting promises, confetti that never lands, each pledge lighter than the last. <words>81</words>
He became bleak the winter he laughed at a funeral and realized the laugh sounded honest. <words>97</words>
Since then, his routines are technically absurd, but the absurdity feels exact, like stitches after a fall. <words>114</words>
The clock hand that won't stop spinning gnaws at minutes until they fray, then slurps them into gray thread. <words>133</words>
Today he vows to master balance on the levitating mats, if only to steady the weather inside him. <words>151</words>
He will teach himself courage by dismantling illusions in private poetry, whispering meter to the porous air. <words>168</words>
No students come this early, so he bows to the empty straps, letting emptiness pull back. <words>184</words>
In the silence he composes a poem about a city of lanterns where sadness rents rooms by the hour. <words>203</words>
He removes one illusion at a time, like peeling tape from a wound, naming them, then setting them afloat. <words>222</words>
Outside, rails yawn awake; when the day's earliest train departs at dawn, its distant hum tunes his breath. <words>240</words>
He gives the hum back as a wheeze of comedy, a sawtooth kindness rasping through his painted teeth. <words>258</words>
He imagines the northern lights shrugging, amused, while their colors tangle with the studio's harnesses. <words>273</words>
He tries to outshine the northern lights with a grin and fails, but the failing glows like a lesson. <words>292</words>
The spinning hand accelerates, as if applause were mechanical, as if time wanted him deservedly smaller. <words>308</words>
He grips the clock, not to stop it, but to feel the tug, the furious river of passing declare its terms. <words>329</words>
Counting inhales as syllables, he masters the pose called Falling Star, legs shaking, smile soldered on. <words>345</words>
Drifting promises stop pretending to be weather and become letters he can mail to his younger self. <words>362</words>
He writes, You will be forgiven for imperfect light, if you keep showing up with pockets full of dawn. <words>381</words>
The studio drifts a little higher, its ropes humming with the train's echo, his lungs ringing like bells. <words>399</words>
He bows to the empty morning and, laughing softly, does not break. <words>411</words>
