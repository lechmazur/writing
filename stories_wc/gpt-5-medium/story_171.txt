By the bicycle-powered carnival on the orchard road, I posed as an obsessive stamp collector hungry for illusions rather than postage. <words>21</words>
It was the season when the orchard sign has faded beyond recognition, and the ferris wheels spun like slow lungs breathing through dust. <words>44</words>
My motive was simple and impossible: to learn the secrets of magic before my courage, which had grown fragile, cracked completely. <words>65</words>
Everyone at the carnival powered the lights with pedaled grace, ravenously gentle as if hunger itself had been taught to pet rather than bite. <words>89</words>
I rented a stall that promised philatelic wonders, but behind my albums I kept a handheld reel to reel and a map of rumored bootlegs buried under midway boards. <words>118</words>
My plan was to reconnect via unearthing bootleg recordings of lost concerts, convinced the old headliner magician hid real workings inside improvisations, misdirection folded into applause. <words>144</words>
A blank luggage tag dangled from the recorder case, an unclaimed truth inviting me to write a destination I had never admitted aloud. <words>167</words>
Night after night I pedaled, the dynamo humming, while strangers traded beet sugar for stamps and told me their grandfathers pulled coins from moonlit cider. <words>192</words>
I listened for the vanished master, a magician singer whose voice flickered in damaged tape, saying my name between chords nobody else could hear. <words>216</words>
One windless dawn, I found a garnet in the dust beneath the fortune tent, a tiny coal of dusk that warmed when the pedals caught light. <words>242</words>
I pressed the stone into the recorder, and the reels stopped squealing, revealing a rehearsal where the master explained palming as a language of remorse. <words>267</words>
He spoke about stamps too, how every cancellation masks a departure, how collections are altars for chances we could not take in time. <words>290</words>
I wept with bold vulnerability, because the act was not to deceive but to cradle attention, to be ravenously gentle with the audience until their guarded wonder returned. <words>318</words>
The carnival boss saw my tears and offered a slot before twilight, saying the orchard remembers those who listen, though the sign forgets their names. <words>343</words>
I wrote my intention on the blank luggage tag, tied it to the mic stand, and began by vanishing stamps that reappeared as tiny, beating apples. <words>369</words>
The bootleg alone taught the patter, but the garnet taught the heat, and together they let me reconnect the broken orchard to itself, each trick a graft. <words>396</words>
When applause rose like wind through leaves that were no longer there, I understood the secret: magic is a postal system for feelings that never found an address. <words>424</words>
I stamped the air with every vanished icon I had hoarded, and the carnival lights, powered by our pedaling, glowed like letters traveling safely through dangerous night. <words>451</words>
Later, I shelved the recorder and kept the garnet near my heart, a quiet metronome of wonder. <words>468</words>
