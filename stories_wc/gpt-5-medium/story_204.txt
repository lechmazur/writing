The abandoned spaceport hangar held a hush like bottled starlight, an ancient novelty waiting for breath before an acceptance speech began. <words>21</words>
Among the folding chairs, I, a professional cuddler, stood with hands unclasped, unusually usual in my patched suit and whispered reputation. <words>42</words>
The city wanted to honor a program I had started, but the honor frightened me because I knew the unspoken rules. <words>63</words>
I had carried a deep-seated prejudice against the old commuters who clung to vanished routes, dismissing their grief as sentimental obstruction. <words>84</words>
Then a chance encounter at a farmer's market opened me, when a widow pressed a brass tool into my palms beside the kumquats. <words>107</words>
It was a phantom train ticket punch, still oiled, its jaws closing on nothing, clicking like a distant signal that refused to fully fade. <words>131</words>
She told me the city once moved by unspoken rules, punctuated holes in paper itineraries, every click a vow that morning would arrive. <words>154</words>
I felt my prejudice decay, not from argument but from the tool's patient rhythm, as though absence had a grammar I could finally hear. <words>178</words>
I began offering evening shelters of touch inside this hangar, teaching volunteers how to hold retired conductors until the past unclenched its teeth. <words>201</words>
We made the unusual feel unusually usual, arranging blankets on the launchplates, matching breathing to wind through broken vents, letting silence take a steadier orbit. <words>226</words>
Now, during the hush before an acceptance speech begins, I remember the bargain the widow asked when she placed the punch between us. <words>249</words>
Learn to listen to what nothing says, she whispered, and stamp the air with care, as if presence issued tickets for our departures. <words>272</words>
The hangar smells of iron and citrus, rockets towering like hollowed trees, banners stained by years, a congregation of elders, students, fruit vendors, and station ghosts. <words>298</words>
The committee once mocked my work as indulgence, yet they saw how grief softened when bodies kept company, and let their mockery decay with the scaffolds. <words>324</words>
I cradle the phantom ticket punch, the widow's relic, and click it toward the dais, a ceremonial metronome setting the keynote's first possible second. <words>348</words>
I will speak, when asked, about unspoken rules of touch that honor boundaries, ask permission, and treat longing as a train arriving exactly on time. <words>373</words>
I will thank the farmer's market and its widow for rerouting me, and call the old commuters teachers, their phantom tickets guiding apprentices through aftermath. <words>398</words>
Until then, in the hush, I keep clicking the antique punch, ancient novelty against silence, counting breaths as departures become arrivals. <words>419</words>
