I arrived at the plant communication study as a quiet deserter, fleeing noise nobody else could hear. <words>17</words>
The greenhouses hummed with dizzyingly grounded purpose, like cathedral choirs sunk into soil. <words>30</words>
I took notes on stomatal whispers and root gossip, pretending my research question was theirs. <words>45</words>
But my true motive was to find a place where one truly belongs, even if it is nowhere. <words>63</words>
A cracked mirror leaned against the potting bench, reflecting me in splinters that organized themselves like grammar. <words>80</words>
Time kept itself throughout jigsaw puzzles, whose assemblage marked my good days and omissions my bad. <words>96</words>
I learned the leaves would open when I confessed what I had abandoned, and close when I lied. <words>114</words>
I had deserted a regiment of scientists who carbonize every question into ash and call it clarity. <words>131</words>
They believed the cycle of hypothesis and erasure could spin forever without ever touching the ground. <words>147</words>
I wanted breaking the cycle itself, not perfecting it, though I lacked the grammar plants demanded. <words>163</words>
So I sought their language by reconstructing stories from shattered porcelain masks the last researcher left behind. <words>180</words>
Each mask held a mouth, and each mouth, when arranged against the glass fractures, told a confession not mine. <words>199</words>
Yet the ivy shifted, writing yes in tendrils, because a borrowed confession is still a shape the air remembers. <words>218</words>
I became a curator of fragments, a cartographer of nowhere, noble foolishness wrapped in a lab coat. <words>235</words>
When experiments stalled, I swung the cracked mirror to capture the greenhouse moon and ignite remembrance. <words>251</words>
Some nights the humidifier hissed like my old commanding officer, and I replied only with clipped breaths. <words>268</words>
Other nights I set a mask upon the potting soil and let seedlings push through its porcelain eyes. <words>286</words>
The seedlings read the jigsaw boxes for omens, and we proceeded together, piece by piece, and sometimes backward. <words>304</words>
I promised them I would not carbonize their secrets, even if fire is the closest thing to silence. <words>322</words>
They answered with sweetness in the sap and a map of tiny pores leading to an unmarked door. <words>340</words>
Through that door I found a hallway of puzzles already complete, nailed to the walls as calendars. <words>357</words>
Their dates matched my confessions, and their pictures depicted what we had made by reconstructing stories from shattered porcelain masks. <words>377</words>
At the end waited a room as dizzyingly grounded as a storm cellar, full of listening ferns. <words>394</words>
I stood before them and broke the mirror once more, because breaking the cycle is sometimes repeating with intention. <words>413</words>
The shards aligned like leaves, the masks whispered a belonging shaped like air, and the ferns approved. <words>430</words>
I realized my place might be nowhere, but nowhere could be a greenhouse if one listens hard enough. <words>448</words>
So I stayed, a quiet deserter with dirt under my nails, timing the seasons throughout jigsaw puzzles. <words>465</words>
And when the next choir of leaves opened, we chose not to perfect the wheel, but to grow beside it. <words>485</words>
