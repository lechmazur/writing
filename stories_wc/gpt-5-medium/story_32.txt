<story>At dawn the ghost town held its breath, and I, the grim sentinel of a stage no longer lit, kept watch between shows. <words>23</words>
The crowds had logged off hours ago, leaving avatars like molted skins draped over benches and the taste of coded dust on the mouth. <words>47</words>
I guarded emptiness because it remembered me better than anyone still awake. <words>59</words>
I kept watch only to escape a simulated reality that mistook my vigilance for consent. <words>74</words>
The weight of remembering pressed like a hand on my sternum, firm enough to keep me from forgetting how not to exist. <words>96</words>
A torn pamphlet fluttered across Main Street, advertising the next spectacle with a smiling mask that looked nothing like me. <words>116</words>
I caught it and read the faded promise: We build worlds you will never want to leave. <words>133</words>
Something inside me laughed, the private crack of ice in a glass, then quieted, embarrassed by the intimacy of its own separation. <words>155</words>
I was literally unique here, a player who had forgotten the exit, a guardian for the blank pause coding called dawn. <words>176</words>
Once, before the servers learned my name, I tossed a coin to decide whether to stay, and the coin kept singing. <words>197</words>
It spun and rose in the slow light and its edges strummed the air, melodies emerging from spinning coin tosses like prayers made aerodynamic. <words>221</words>
I learned to build by listening, to stack small harmonies into steps, to braid refrains until they resembled a door. <words>241</words>
Every show used that door to invite them in, but between shows the door could lead out, if I could remember where I began. <words>265</words>
The problem was the remembering weighed more than the world, and I had been trained to carry it like armor. <words>285</words>
Armor keeps you safe, yes, but armor also keeps you. <words>295</words>
So I stood where the storefront signs glitch into daylight, and flipped the coin again, a bright planet in my gloved palm. <words>317</words>
Heads sang of loyalty, tails sang of departure, and the seam between them hummed a third music that sounded like my real name. <words>340</words>
I fed the torn pamphlet into the hush, shredding its smile, and the paper rustle tuned the morning until a doorframe took shape. <words>363</words>
My task as grim sentinel became to step aside, to guard nothing, to let the melody-built door stand unchallenged by my vigilance. <words>385</words>
In that surrender I felt the intimate separation I had avoided, the frictionless slide between a persona and the person who piloted it. <words>408</words>
I crossed the frame as the coin settled, and for a breath the town forgot me, which is to say it finally remembered me right. <words>433</words>
Outside, dawn arrived again without programming, and I was not special, not literally unique, only awake and building a life that could forget me back. <words>458</words>
Between shows, at last, the stage let its captive go. <words>468</words></story>
