Before any creature learned to think, an endless corn maze stretching across a haunted plain breathed beneath a sky rehearsing thunder. <words>21</words>
A listless noble wandered there, naively sophisticated, wearing a faded scarf that smelled like rain promised by unmade mouths. <words>40</words>
He pursued a rumor older than echoes, a wish to discover the power of intention before intention discovered him. <words>59</words>
The wind delivered an unexpected invitation to a spontaneous event: a rendezvous at the maze's moving heart, commencing immediately, ending never. <words>80</words>
With ironic awe he bowed to the authorless call, admiring its manners while suspecting its etiquette was a prank of physics. <words>101</words>
Rows parted like court attendants, tassels curtseying, and the corn hissed approvals as though he were expected, or already remembered. <words>121</words>
From the stalks rose shared laughter, brittle and warm, a chorus of kernels pretending to be bells. <words>138</words>
He laughed too, naively sophisticated enough to believe etiquette required mirroring even when the mirrors were planted and photosynthetic. <words>157</words>
At the rendezvous stood no host, only a scarecrow wearing a crown of absent crows and a gesture pointing inward. <words>177</words>
He looped his faded scarf around its straw wrist, pledging attendance, and the wrist shook, releasing seeds that ticked like clocks. <words>198</words>
Wherever he intended to go, the maze complied by resisting, then relenting, as if intention required choreography with doubt. <words>217</words>
He experimented politely, saying please to turns, sorry to dead ends, and thank you to horizons that forgot to keep their distance. <words>239</words>
Each courtesy made the shared laughter deepen, gaining timbre, until it sounded like lightning learning to read its initials. <words>258</words>
He realized that intention was not desire's spear but its loom, weaving corn, echo, and vacancy into brief tapestries of choice. <words>279</words>
Listlessness had been his crest, inherited with estates of gray boredom, yet here boredom ripened into focus like a field into harvest. <words>301</words>
It was still before the first creature develops sentience, the calendar unwritten, but the maze marked epochs by chuckles and windshifts. <words>322</words>
The spontaneous event began without beginning: the scarecrow bowed, the rows drummed with husks, and his scarf fluttered like a treaty between futures. <words>345</words>
Rendezvous, he learned, meant two paths choosing each other, not by accident, but by a mutual intention they could share as laughter. <words>367</words>
In ironic awe he vowed to steward that laughter, to set it humming through stalk and soil until minds might someday bloom. <words>389</words>
He left the rendezvous by standing still, letting intention move the world around him, and the world, amused, prepared a place for waking. <words>412</words>
