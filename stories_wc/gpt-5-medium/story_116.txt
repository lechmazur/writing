Night kept its velvet oath in the black velvet sky-lounge floating above an endless city, where I performed and listened, a dismayed minstrel torn between hush and cheer. <words>28</words>
Around the terrace planters, we drank in blurred constellations amid garden secrets, perfumes drifting upward from hidden roots stitched into the ceiling like patient stars. <words>53</words>
I had one errand: to draw a map of an endless night, a chart honest enough to keep my heart from wandering off its chords. <words>78</words>
My only compass was a broken watch band, its face long gone, its leather smelling of rain that had once fallen on a stage that never closed. <words>105</words>
Time had drawn boundaries around rooms I barely remembered, chalk lines between verses, dividing applause from silence, yet the lines felt merciful, like guards who hummed lullabies. <words>132</words>
I am subjectively rational, I tell myself, weighing omens by their tempo rather than their teeth, discarding whatever cannot dance or be counted in eighths. <words>157</words>
So I began to excavate the lounges hush by studying old polaroid photographs, their milky ghosts demanding patience, their corners bent like the eyebrows of resigned magicians. <words>184</words>
In those squares I found the city repeating itself, balconies afloat under the sky-lounge, roots threading chandeliers, garden secrets winked into captions nobody signed. <words>208</words>
I was dismayed because every song I wrote erased a street, and I feared the map would become a melody that forgot its own address. <words>233</words>
The owner, with lapels like comets, said play shorter, play brighter, and slid me a drink that crackled, laconic exuberance poured into a glass the color of halted thunder. <words>262</words>
In a Polaroid I caught my wrist mid-strum, the broken watch band framing a sliver of balcony rail, a drawn boundary masquerading as ornament. <words>286</words>
If the band had framed the rail, then the rail was the measure, I reasoned, and my subjectively rational heart heard the garden secrets whisper, count breaths, not hours. <words>315</words>
I began to pace the terrace, looping the band around posts, letting it drop and swing, excavate the air for distances, sketching arcs from which the labyrinth confessed itself. <words>344</words>
The map that unfolded looked like a score sleeping, measures stitched to alleys, crescendos to stairwells, a guide praising silence where needed, and arrows pointing through an endless night. <words>373</words>
The drawn boundaries no longer caged me; they held the air still enough to hear the city breathe, and I felt merrily precise, a repaired silence clicking where time had slipped. <words>404</words>
I played the new route aloud for the owner and the sky, signed the chart with the broken watch band, and finally, amid garden secrets, I dared to draw a map of an endless night. <words>439</words>
