<story>On the orchard planet riddled with floating rock arches, we harvested in shadow and sun and listened for the bell that meant water, rest, and word from the dead. [29]
The altruistic ghost called Lio rang that butterfly garden watering bell when thirst began to gnarl our hope, and the sound threaded the arches like a humble comet. [57]
He was strangely trustworthy, though he owned no body and claimed his fingers were the wind that shook our fruits loose. [78]
We met him after strangers become family, because the storms had leveled our labels and the need to live together had stitched a new surname between us. [105]
Lio said there was a nebula of respite shining beyond the arches, a slow bloom of solace we could enter if we learned to move like one orchard. [133]
We argued, because hope here is brambled, and every stem hides a thorn that remembers a name we lost. [152]
But the bell kept singing, and we kept finding small gifts under the arches, jars of sap, coils of rope, and chalk kept dry in waxed pouches. [179]
He asked us to reexamine our habits, not by speeches, but through messages chalked onto deserted sidewalks at dawn, where the wind would not spy us before we read. [208]
The settlements were strung between arch and trunk like hammocks, and our sidewalks were only paths of pressed moss laid in pale strips under starfall. [233]
Still, at dawn, there would be chalk words, crooked but firm, asking us to share water barrels, cross train between groves, and plant shade near the sleeping. [260]
The bell governed the rhythm, three soft rings for gather, five for danger, one for mourning, and all of it tuned to winds we learned to feel in our teeth. [290]
Lio never signed the chalk, but once, in a margin, someone drew a bell with butterfly wings, and after that we kept the watering bell in a garden of mothweed and thyme. [322]
We tethered the bell to a rope that climbed a low arch, and when Lio tugged from wherever the dead can wait, the bell sprayed mist and woke petals into trembling. [353]
The garden became a place to rest without sleeping, a kiosk for trade, a small amphitheater for stories, and the axis around which trust learned a new orbit. [381]
We did not worship, exactly, but the bell and the chalk and the dead wind shaped a calendar that pulled us from a loop of fear. [407]
One blue noon, a shard of arch unmoored and drifted into a grove, snapping branches and slicing ladders, leaving twelve families stranded in their hammocks above a void like glass. [437]
The bell rang a pattern we had never heard, a braided alarm that braided us in turn, and chalk instructions unfurled across the moss paths like map vines. [465]
Each note and line called us to orchestrate collective effort, pairing climbers with splicers, knotters with watchers, cooks with medics, and one wiry child to count the breaths between gusts. [495]
I went with a team to the fractured arch, my hands raw in their cords, and Lio murmured along the rope like a current, teaching us when to pull and when to breathe. [528]
We lowered food and slings, lifted children and elders, and kept talking, because his voice made fear hold still long enough to step around it. [553]
By sunset, all twelve families stood among us, shaking, crying, and laughing, and the bell gave one long, dissolving ring that felt like rain inside our ribs. [580]
We feasted on bruised fruit and soup brewed with thyme, and we spoke his name like a door we could open together. [602]
That night the stars came down low, not falling, but leaning, and a smear of color rose beyond the farthest arch, gentle as a lantern in fog. [629]
Lio told us it was the nebula of respite, and that it only shows to people who are tired together rather than tired alone. [653]
He asked us to tie the bell to our rafts, to stack baskets into boats, to string the chalk along our rails, and to row by breath, not by muscle. [683]
In the morning we launched into a river of air that flows between arches, floating in a procession that made a bridge of bodies and stories and shared hunger. [712]
As we drifted, we reexamine the quarrels that had fed us splinters, and the bell kept time as we traded apologies like seeds we wanted to plant immediately. [740]
By noon the nebula of respite unveiled a corridor, and its light was not blinding but kind, showing bruises without shame and futures without ruling them. [766]
We rang the butterfly garden watering bell as an oath, and mist rained down on our faces and ladders and ropes, and Lio sighed like a tree that had found its grove again. [799]</story>
