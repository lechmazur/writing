Amid grocery shopping, I paused between cabbages and cumin to notice the old smoke signal tower brooding beyond the parking lot. <words>21</words>
I am a cunning connoisseur of textures, tastes, and whispers, and the tower tasted to my eyes like singed thyme. <words>41</words>
In my basket lay vintage seed packets, their paper brittle as pastry, their dates older than any clerk still punching a clock. <words>63</words>
I had bought them for dinner conversation, yet their tiny illustrations began decoding the forgotten inside me, petal by symbol. <words>83</words>
Each sachet bore a faint grid, like smoke blown into squares, an index that promised a path through gentle chaos. <words>103</words>
A sudden urge to explore a path not taken spilled my list onto the linoleum, peaches rolling like small suns. <words>123</words>
I wheeled outside, abandoning deli arithmetic, and headed for the tower whose ladder carried the color of burned rosemary. <words>142</words>
Morally ambiguous is the only coat I own, and it keeps me warm when doors say staff only. <words>160</words>
I climbed and unpacked the packets, aligning their grids with the horizon until the town arranged itself like a patient mural. <words>181</words>
The mural mapped smoke routes from harvest fires long extinguished, and the tower became a library where ash remembered. <words>200</words>
To fix the fading diagrams, I xerograph the envelopes using the grocery receipt printer I had pilfered with a smile. <words>220</words>
The copies bloom charcoal, and every blossom matches a roofline, every tendril a path for wind to ferry meaning. <words>239</words>
I realize the packets once guided neighbors to plant signals that could call rain, invite trade, or warn lovers to hush. <words>260</words>
Decoding the forgotten makes my hands shake, because knowledge is a ladder and a knife, and I have both pockets. <words>280</words>
If I share the routes, the town could breathe again; if I keep them, I could corner an elusive destiny. <words>300</words>
I test a single plume, lighting sage from a safety match, letting gray syllables rise and curve toward those old coordinates. <words>321</words>
Down below, shopping carts rattle wildly but kindly, an orchestra tuning while children insist on cereal diplomacy. <words>338</words>
The smoke curls into the copied grid, and the tower groans like a throat remembering a lullaby taught by drought. <words>358</words>
Across town, sprinklers hesitate, shopkeepers pause their scales, and the sky writes a brief receipt for mercy, subtotal due later. <words>378</words>
I fold the xerographs into my coat, and the morally ambiguous lining rustles like currency, reminding me that sharing carries tax. <words>399</words>
I choose a middle way, planting hints where hunger becomes curiosity. <words>410</words>
