<story>By the sea, a town-weary traveler pushed open the bowed door of the abandoned carnival house of mirrors. <words>18</words>
Salt fog made halos of his breath, a hammered repose settling on the broken booths. <words>33</words>
He had come to escape the confines of one's mind, the one that kept mapping fences onto horizon and heart. <words>53</words>
Wind spoke in trickster tongues along the boardwalk. <words>61</words>
Somewhere outside, guidance arrived via the tapping of a metal sign swinging in coastal wind, a code older than luck. <words>81</words>
Inside, mirrors faced mirrors until the corridors looked infinite and intentionally accidental, a paradox he trusted. <words>97</words>
Each pane shivered with ghosted versions of him, none certain, all possible. <words>109</words>
He walked toward a stained glass panel nailed where a mirror had cracked out long ago. <words>125</words>
The panel caught what little dawn slid through the slats, breaking it into the cradle of sparks that scattered across his boots. <words>147</words>
He remembered how he learned to stand still and let small lights fertilize the dark, one patient shimmer at a time. <words>168</words>
The carnival had been a ribcage of joy once, and the mirrors had known laughter that arrived like storms. <words>187</words>
Now only the sea and the sign made talk, and he answered with the hush between breaths. <words>204</words>
In that hush, he felt the world tilt toward a sentence nobody had managed to say without trembling. <words>222</words>
The space before confession thickened, the very timeframe of the place slowed: in the hush before someone finally says, "I love you." <words>244</words>
The traveler pictured that sentence not as a destination but as a lantern hung at a midpoint, a promise to move. <words>265</words>
He wanted to reach it and also to escape it, to escape the confines of one's mind that kept editing joy with caution. <words>288</words>
A gull clattered through a hole in the roof, startling him into laughter that sounded borrowed, then earned. <words>306</words>
Behind the stained glass, he saw his face rearranged into mosaics that belonged to no town and every road. <words>325</words>
They looked intentionally accidental, like the way two people meet by missing everything else first. <words>340</words>
He touched the panel, and a fan of sparks trembled over his knuckles as the sign kept tapping out its wind-drunk patience. <words>362</words>
The code translated itself within him: keep walking, keep hearing, let the broken multiplicity make one honest thing. <words>380</words>
He felt the sentence drawing near like weather, not a thunderclap but a slow rain that could fertilize a field left fallow by fear. <words>404</words>
He would leave the house of mirrors when the light finally landed, not to be seen but to be recognized. <words>424</words>
Until then, he stood inside the cradle of sparks, testing the sentence on his tongue without sound, waiting for an answer he might meet halfway. <words>449</words>
The mirrors gave him back a horizon inside, and the sea gave him back a horizon outside, and together they lined a path where, when the hush finally split, he would not be afraid. <words>483</words></story>
