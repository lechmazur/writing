<story>I arrived at the psychic research facility rattled, an exorcist with trembling hands and a schedule full of borrowed dance lessons. <words>21</words>
I am inwardly social, happiest when voices brush my mind without the friction of faces, and today the halls hummed. <words>41</words>
The director greeted me with coy aggression, offering tea and guarded disclosures about anomalies fluttering like curtains in crosswinds. <words>60</words>
He slid across the table a vintage postcard, its edges scalloped, its ink a field of tiny storms twitching beneath the stamp. <words>82</words>
On the reverse, a diagram promised a series of puzzles that unlock a hidden room, if read in the right rhythm. <words>103</words>
I was hired to entwine science with wonder, to synthesize ritual with data, to be the hinge between apparatus and apparition. <words>124</words>
Amid dance lessons, I practiced a foxstep down the corridor, counting beats like sigils while interns adjusted Faraday cages and mirrors. <words>145</words>
The first puzzle hid under the sprung floor: brass inlays forming constellations, each step a star that clicked when pressure matched pulse. <words>167</words>
Rattled though I was, I let coy aggression sharpen my footwork, daring the room to show me what it hid. <words>187</words>
The inlays answered, clicking in triplets; wall panels sighed, and a slit in the parquet exhaled a scent of patient rain. <words>208</words>
The postcard's stamp revealed microprint, a cipher instructing me to synthesize incense compounds with ion channel blockers, a choreography for neurons. <words>229</words>
I obeyed because exorcisms had become lonely negotiations, and because inwardly social minds like mine crave rooms where thoughts can dance. <words>250</words>
Still, the director's guarded disclosures irritated me; facts arrived veiled, like partners who flirt but refuse to commit to the dip. <words>271</words>
The hidden room opened with a hush that felt earned, revealing a theater of instruments: pendulums, coils, and chairs fitted with listening crowns. <words>294</words>
On a lectern stood a projector, casting the vintage postcard huge, its reverse animated by a soldier's script, looping homeward without arriving. <words>316</words>
We rigged electrodes, set metronomes, and I led the room in a measured waltz, asking spirits to synthesize coherence with our measurable wonder. <words>339</words>
With coy aggression I called the soldier by rank and tenderness, demanding he declare his coordinates, or at least his unfinished promise. <words>361</words>
He answered in pulses through the listening crowns, guarded disclosures translating as strobing map lights that stitched trenches to a farmhouse kitchen. <words>383</words>
I saw my mother's apron in that kitchen and understood why I was rattled: I wanted to entwine science with wonder, not escape grief. <words>407</words>
So I set the metronome to his heartbeat, led a final turn, and released him on the twelfth step into clean, unmeasured dark. <words>430</words>
The instruments calmed, data sang, the director dropped his mask with a nod, and the vintage postcard finally dimmed like a tired lighthouse. <words>453</words>
I kept one guarded disclosure for myself, inwardly social as ever, practicing steps between machines, knowing the next room would learn our rhythm. <words>476</words>
