<story>I keep brazen calm in the haunted lighthouse watch room, the sea wheezing through cracked panes like an exhausted bellows.<words>20</words>
I am the unseen observer, and tonight I am finally seen by what matters.<words>34</words>
Below, the tide hums the undercurrent of wisdom, a basso line older than the lighthouse or my rusted bones.<words>53</words>
I hold a basic plastic whistle, ridiculous in its brightness, yet tuned by storms to carry the deep's address.<words>72</words>
My mission is aggressively kind: to rescue ancient traditions before they drown under neon froth and algorithmic fog.<words>90</words>
They say a stage will rise from the water when the right rhythm is called, and someone will dance the first step.<words>112</words>
At the instant a dancer's foot first touches the stage, old pacts breathe again, and the lighthouse stops being merely haunted.<words>133</words>
It becomes remembering, which is the braver haunting.<words>141</words>
So I wait with brazen calm, counting swells for tempo, listening for the cue that never comes from instruments.<words>160</words>
It must arrive by the call of a whale from the deep, a sound braided with salt, grief, and immaculate patience.<words>181</words>
When at last the note unspools through the stones, I answer with my toy, absurd prayer to an older cathedral.<words>201</words>
I fling the basic plastic whistle's cry into the fog, a bright thread stitching wind to water to waiting stage.<words>221</words>
The watch room tilts, lanterns sway, and a plank runway unfolds over black waves like a tongue of memory.<words>240</words>
Out of the foam steps a dancer robed in kelp, face unreadable, ankles ringing with shells that know arithmetic.<words>259</words>
I am still the unseen observer, but the unseen is welcomed here, folded like a secret pocket inside ceremony.<words>278</words>
Her foot hovers, the whale calls again, and I feel the undercurrent of wisdom move through ribs like oars.<words>297</words>
At the instant a dancer's foot first touches the stage, my lighthouse exhales, and the dead turn their faces to listen.<words>318</words>
She dances not for applause but rescue, packing vanished boat lore, lullabies, and salt prayers back into living speech.<words>337</words>
Each turn is aggressively kind, a correction softened by mercy, a command that feels like a neighbor's hand on the shoulder.<words>358</words>
I blow my whistle in time, a humble metronome, and the stage widens until the whole coast can step aboard.<words>378</words>
Stories torn by gales stitch themselves together; knots remember how to hold; a grandmother's recipe reenters the village without shame.<words>398</words>
Even the ghosts unclench, because tradition is not a chain but a boat, and boats are made to carry and return.<words>419</words>
The dancer bows to the sea, then to me, who has been here all along, patient in the watch room's flicker.<words>440</words>
I slip back into unseen observer, yet every window now holds a face I know, and the wind speaks in syllables.<words>461</words>
When dawn chalks the water, I pocket the basic plastic whistle, its cheap shine suddenly ceremonial, and close the door softly.<words>482</words>
