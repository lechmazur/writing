I came to the lost orchard temple with fruit-laden vines because rumors said its trees remembered what the city forgot. <words>20</words>
A streetwise orphan survives on rumors, but I needed truth enough to risk hunger and thorns, and something whispered my name. <words>41</words>
Pinned inside my jacket lay a cursed cameo brooch, a keepsake from a mother I barely remember and a warning I never forget. <words>64</words>
It warmed when danger neared and cooled at mercy, its malice steady as a distant echo cloaked in borrowed affection. <words>84</words>
Under the temple arch, I felt confident uncertainty, like stepping into fog with a compass that pointed only to my heartbeat. <words>105</words>
The floor mosaics formed maps that made sense only through reversed patterns, as if the orchard taught me to read roots before wings. <words>128</words>
Each step contrasted sweetness against rot, light against lichen, and my heartbeat against the theoretically random drip of subterranean springs. <words>148</words>
I moved by contrast, testing dark corridors with bitten fruit, watching which flesh blackened, which brightened, and which refused either script. <words>169</words>
The brooch hummed when I chose the path that bent away from carvings of kings, toward cracked frescoes praising nameless hands. <words>190</words>
Here the orchard kept its own liturgy, sung across an unwritten calendar by wind, bees, and the slow grammar of ripening. <words>211</words>
I listened for a distant echo of her voice, imagining my mother naming the fruits she could never afford to buy me. <words>233</words>
When the echo arrived, it was mine, older and younger, telling me to harvest hope from darkness before the darkness harvested me. <words>255</words>
I broke a grape that shone like a bruise, then laid it on the brooch; the metal drank, and the fruit kept shining. <words>278</words>
Through reversed patterns again, I fed sweetness to curse, hunger to symbol, a boy to his shadow, until the shadow learned appetite limits. <words>301</words>
The walls breathed and shifted, rearranging tiles into alleyways I once ran, offering exits that smelled like rain and debts I already paid. <words>324</words>
Confident uncertainty held me steady, because a clean escape before the lesson completes is only another kind of trap. <words>343</words>
So I traced the murals backward, naming what I lacked, and the temple answered forward, giving what I could carry without forgetting. <words>365</words>
Vines bowed into doorways like tutors, cupping pears beside pitfall lips, and I learned to read the orchard the way pickpockets read sleeves. <words>388</words>
The cameo brooch cooled at last, not cured but listening, its curse diluted by a patient contrast I could live beside. <words>409</words>
When I left the lost orchard temple with fruit-laden vines, the city sounded kinder, the echo closer, and the future uncarved but reachable. <words>432</words>
