I am a superstitious submarine engineer who reads omens in pressure gauges and rust. <words>14</words>
Storms teach me that steel remembers, and that remembrance grows loudest in the space between thunder and lightning. <words>32</words>
Tonight the echo arrives as a city scavenger hunt sends strangers sprinting past the pier, clutching clues like talismans. <words>51</words>
A chance encounter stops one beside my moored submersible: a woman with salt-gray hair and a scarred poet's notebook. <words>70</words>
She asks if I know a route beneath the waterfront, where the map lists only municipal pipes. <words>87</words>
Her voice carries the weight of women's wisdom, not heavy, but undeniable as tide. <words>101</words>
I quip about tourist liability, yet my breath fogs like prayer against the hatch window. <words>116</words>
She smiles, always strange, as if each molar were a polished shell revealing far coasts. <words>131</words>
Together we descend, machines humming, the harbor a black lung exhaling secrets into our lights. <words>146</words>
The mysterious underwater cave system opens like a cathedral whose architect feared daylight more than sin. <words>162</words>
She writes coordinates in the notebook, and the scars across its cover catch the LEDs like old surf. <words>180</words>
These were my sister's caves, she says, and she died learning their sentences, which only echo after breath. <words>198</words>
Under the silt, statues kneel, faces carved into mid-inhale, as though prayer were a physics problem. <words>214</words>
My instruments flicker, and my superstition angles the dials like sainted needles seeking true hope. <words>229</words>
We anchor in a vault where stalactites resemble the teeth of clocks, waiting to finish a bite. <words>246</words>
She opens the notebook and reads a poem that tastes of brine, iron, and unfinished journeys. <words>262</words>
In its margins, a hand has diagrammed a ritual: touch stone, speak a name, share a lungful of air. <words>281</words>
She wants to transcend the physical realm, she confesses, not to leave, but to stop leaving. <words>297</words>
Every woman in my family has been tide, she says, pulled from herself twice daily until the bones shine. <words>316</words>
Teach me the machinery that keeps a soul from sloshing overboard. <words>327</words>
I am no priest, I say, but the deeper we go, the more the hull speaks our names. <words>345</words>
We follow the poem, taking turns with the rebreather, pressing our hands to rock that hums like blood. <words>363</words>
When our palms meet, the lights die; thunder rolls far above, and between the booms the cave answers. <words>381</words>
It is a quiver felt in tooth roots, a syllable unpronounceable, a permission that tastes like a closed wound opening. <words>401</words>
In that hush, in the space between thunder and lightning, we feel ourselves loosen from weight. <words>417</words>
The cave does not steal us; instead it lends us back to water, tuned to carry women's wisdom forward. <words>436</words>
When we surface, the city lights bruise the fog, and her notebook's scars look strangely healed. <words>452</words>
I ask for a page; she tears one free and tells me to write only what the ocean can remember. <words>472</words>
So I write our breath, our quip and our fear, and the promise that machinery will learn to listen. <words>491</words>
