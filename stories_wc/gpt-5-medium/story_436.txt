The sorrowful apothecary shuffled across the exiled fortress floating above scorching deserts, cradling a cracked ledger of family recipes. <words>19</words>
Tonight, in the final minute before a library shuts its doors, he sought the only threshold still rumored to open. <words>39</words>
An oracle nested among chained stacks had fallen silent years ago, and he wished, simply, to tempt an oracle to speak again. <words>61</words>
He believed the key could be found by decoding dream catchers left behind by his mother, once the fortress librarian. <words>81</words>
They were roughly refined nets of wire and glass, whispering maplike instructions whenever heat from the deserts rose through the stone. <words>102</words>
Under his coat, he carried a plastic spoon, the lone relic of a market day before exile, bright as contraband moonlight. <words>123</words>
With it he stirred tinctures and could bifurcate a brew into twin fates, one for memory and one for promise. <words>143</words>
He entered the library as bells tolled, and the guards counted down, promising the doors would seal themselves in sixty breaths. <words>164</words>
The oracle sat beside a window of crosshatched iron, its throat a dull jar, its pupils reflecting the sandstorms below. <words>184</words>
I told it a joke my father loved, a recipe anecdote, and felt that painful joy when laughter is missing but memory answers. <words>207</words>
Then I hung the dream catchers between candleflames and read their shadows, lines bifurcating across the walls like veins of mica. <words>228</words>
My mother had used the plastic spoon to divide the past, skimming scum from grief so words could rise unburned. <words>248</words>
Each family recipe was also a cipher, telling me which herb to crush, which page to crease, which silence to answer. <words>269</words>
My craft was roughly refined, like a blade hammered on a doorstep, but it cut truth from the fibrous hides of myth. <words>291</words>
The oracle watched my hands and the guards shouted thirty, twenty, fifteen, and heat rose, pulling open the metal mouths of the shelves. <words>314</words>
I brewed a draught to tempt the oracle to speak again, dipping the plastic spoon until the liquid shone like dawn. <words>335</words>
It held desert heat, stone dust, a tear I denied, and the warm aftertaste of cardamom that always made mother sing. <words>356</words>
From the dream catchers I decoded the last instruction: speak the first recipe backwards, and let the fortress choose the tongue. <words>377</words>
I whispered syllables like seeds blown homeward, and as the minute ended and doors breathed shut, the oracle found its voice. <words>398</words>
It spoke in two streams at once, a bifurcated blessing: one forgiving my losses, one promising the fortress would descend for harvest. <words>420</words>
In painful joy I realized the recipes had not preserved our meals but our mouths, and tonight they saved a language from exile. <words>443</words>
I pocketed the plastic spoon, roughly refined by all its stirring, and followed the voice toward morning, promising to teach it home. <words>465</words>
