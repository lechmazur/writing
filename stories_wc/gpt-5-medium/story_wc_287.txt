<story>After the final petal drops from the old rosebush, I stop pretending the season can be bargained with. [18]
I am a fire escape gardener, which means I have learned to love what clings to iron while winds test its small bravado. [41]
I am also wistfully pragmatic, saving cracked pots, cuttings, and promises for the next workable patch of light. [59]
Tonight the railing glows, while below the street answers the tide with neon sighs, and the harbor waits like a sleeping lung. [81]
It is a luminous harbor by moonlight, the kind of silver that makes edges patient and mistakes less loud. [100]
On my lap sits a small brass thing, a lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth, polished by years of pocketed worry. [119]
It belonged to my father, who could read a lock the way I read soil, feeling which ridges wanted relief and which grooves hid a story. [145]
He told me once that every door is a garden in winter, tense, waiting for the right touch to coax the gate to thaw. [169]
The lighthouse at Pier Eleven has been dark since the hospital started counting backward for my mother, and when the first petal fell, I promised the last would be my signal. [200]
I go because my hands still want to reflect light into dark corners, because the dead are patient with our delays but the living crash on unseen jetties. [228]
I tuck the tooth into my sleeve and climb, each step punctuated by a quivering hush that seems to inhale with me and hold. [252]
Down the alley, I slide into the skiff I have patched so often it now believes in mending more than in first tries. [275]
I row toward the point with the rhythm of oars in water, steady, counting breaths, matching my pulse to the quiet thunder in the pilings. [300]
The moon shoals on the waves and makes the broken windows of the fish plant look like a congregation of eyes learning to forgive. [324]
Gulls sleep tucked into themselves, and my oarlocks sing a gentle complaint, and all of it is a lullaby that acts like a promise I have not yet spoken. [353]
At the base of the light, the gate sulks, her hinges bitten by salt, and the padlock stares with its single blind pupil. [376]
I kneel, the stone cold through my pants, and hold the lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth like a prayer I am not embarrassed to try. [400]
The pick rides the tiny notches, measuring absence, listening for the place where metal remembers how to open. [418]
I work by breath and feel, trying to instill patience into my shaking wrists the way my father taught me to talk to jammed valves and stubborn seeds. [446]
When the shackle surrenders, it is so quiet I mistake the click for my heart deciding not to leave me. [466]
Inside, the lantern waits with its wick brittle as a grass blade in January, the oil skin sticky, the glass filmed with a decade of grief. [492]
I unscrew, clean, and refill, my cloth moving in circles small enough to keep the past from sloshing out all at once. [514]
The quivering hush thickens as if the moon has paused her own rowing, waiting to see if I can make this voice carry. [537]
I strike the match and the small flame answers with a soft astonishment, and I shelter it with my palm the way I once covered a fledgling. [564]
That was the year we installed window boxes with lettuce and marigolds and learned that hunger can wear a polite face and still be urgent. [589]
The wick takes the fire, then the glass takes the wick, then the room takes the glass, and the lantern breathes like someone waking in a spare bed and finding it enough. [621]
I shoulder the lens, sweep the beam, and the harbor flinches, then steadies, then leans toward the brightness with a frank relief that feels like forgiveness. [647]
Across the channel, a window opens, and someone lifts a child, and they point, and the pointing is a kind of prayer that needs no words. [673]
I sit on the catwalk, tucked under the light like a moth under its own idea of heaven, and let the beam revolve through me. [698]
Protected vulnerability is not a posture but an architecture, the way the lantern houses the flame with glass that can break and still be the only way it shines. [727]
I think of the fire escape, its steps crowded with pots that have learned to catch rain, and I know I will cut the lighthouse beam into slips and root it at home. [760]
I will water the corners and windowsills and alleys with light, and instill in the bricks a habit of kindness they can reflect when nights turn mean. [787]</story>
