After the storm uses up its last rumble, the cyberpunk city night market exhales neon like wet incense across the alleys. <words>21</words>
I step in, a broke swashbuckler with a coat of borrowed sparks, fashionably unfashionable and obscenely empty-pocketed. <words>38</words>
My motives glow with fervent apathy, yet burn anyway. <words>47</words>
I am here to shelter kindness in a world on fire, even if my hands look like ashes. <words>65</words>
Rumor says a courier child vanished with a ledger of debts that could deprogram cruelty, and corporate dogs are sniffing. <words>85</words>
I find her aunt hunched under a tarp of repair parts, hugging a shoebox and staring through me like cheap glass. <words>106</words>
She whispers that the child left signs only fools or poets would read, and I qualify as both by necessity. <words>126</words>
From the shoebox, I lift a vintage hatpin shaped like a comet, its nickel tail scratched with gridlines. <words>144</words>
The aunt says it points where the marbles spiral, and the marbles remember where feet do not. <words>161</words>
I rent a room above the market, a bed sagging like a tired antenna, and I kneel to the dust. <words>181</words>
The floorboards emit a drone as if yawning, and under the bed waits a galaxy of antique marbles. <words>199</words>
I chart the swirl of antique marbles scattered under a bed by cigarette ash and window draft, mapping currents no algorithm bothers to believe. <words>223</words>
The hatpin becomes a compass rose, pricking paper circles as orbits steady, a stellar grammar of small decisions. <words>241</words>
The pattern points to a drain behind the soy-oil stall, where the concrete sweats the perfume of machinery and regret. <words>261</words>
I pry the grate with the comet tail, scrape blood, and slip into the maintenance veins the city refuses to acknowledge. <words>282</words>
Down there, my apathy has edges, fervent to cut ropes and yet tired of postures. <words>297</words>
I find the child in a chamber of obsolete routers, holding a candle stub like a treaty with darkness. <words>316</words>
She tests me with a question about mercy, and I answer by giving her my last water and my last joke. <words>337</words>
Together we climb, following the marble map inverted in memory, while overheard boots try to pin us like bad butterflies. <words>357</words>
At the grate, the hatpin earns its vintage, jamming a camera swivel as we slip into the market's steam and anonymity. <words>378</words>
I sell nothing, but I trade rumors for shelter, and aunt hides us behind kegs of resin. <words>395</words>
The ledger becomes ash in a tea brazier because some fires deserve warmth, not leverage. <words>410</words>
Corporate dogs arrive late, muzzled by the sudden weather of witnesses and the gentle riot of nightly commerce. <words>428</words>
We walk out dressed in apathy and sparks, the child wearing my coat, me wearing a future with uncertain seams. <words>448</words>
Overcoming adversity is never a duel but a choreography, and even I can dance when the song is kindness. <words>467</words>
The market exhales again, fashionably unfashionable, and I tuck the hatpin into her hair like a private constellation. <words>485</words>
We move on, not heroes, just two sparks choosing not to go out. <words>498</words>
