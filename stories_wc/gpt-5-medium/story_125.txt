I waited in the abandoned space station control room that squatted like a barn at the boundary of farmland soon to be sold. <words>23</words>
Bored excitement is a strange motor, slow and steady, but it kept my underachieving mage heart idling. <words>40</words>
I was here to spring a trap on my own limitations, and laziness was the bait. <words>56</words>
For years my spells had been exceptionally usual, obedient as dust, never daring to rise. <words>71</words>
Then the misdelivered packages began arriving with my morning milk, addressed to ancestors I only knew from rumors. <words>89</words>
Inside them were tools that felt like memories, and a doll head with blinking eyes that clicked when the lights flickered. <words>110</words>
Someone had written unveil in a careful hand on the cotton batting, as if instructing a magician too timid for curtains. <words>131</words>
So I brought the parcels to the old control room, where cracked screens still showed constellations no one bothered to rename. <words>152</words>
The farmland outside pressed like a patient audience, leased rows of wheat whispering about the sale and the sky. <words>171</words>
I set the doll head atop the main console, its blinking eyes syncing to a faint heartbeat pulsing through the station hull. <words>193</words>
The head watched me with the tireless boredom of a shepherd, waiting for me to admit I had lost the flock. <words>214</words>
I spoke the names on the labels, each syllable a small hazard, and the room rotated as if memory had mass. <words>235</words>
A circuit warmed under my palm, and a map unfolded in the cracked glass, not of stars but of deeds and boundaries. <words>257</words>
The parcels had been meant for them, the ones who tilled and charted, yet they had reached me via misdelivered packages, and that mistake felt deliberate. <words>283</words>
My family fled the station when the harvest predictions faltered, leaving behind a registry of oaths embedded in these consoles. <words>303</words>
Their heritage was a contract with sunlight, and I had lived below it, harvesting excuses, pretending the ceiling was the sky. <words>324</words>
To reclaim that heritage I needed to obey the instruction and unveil what I feared, which was not failure but duty. <words>345</words>
I lifted the doll head, and it projected a corridor into air, a dirt path stitched through constellations, leading from here to the boundary. <words>369</words>
The trap was simple, sprung against the laziness that kept me small, because the corridor demanded I walk while reciting the registry. <words>391</words>
Every step I took clicked the eyes, and every name I honored lit another panel, the station waking like a field at dawn. <words>414</words>
Outside, surveyors rolled up with clipboards, but the console drafted a new deed that merged orbit and acreage, canceling the sale with lawful starlight. <words>438</words>
I had not conjured a storm or a dragon, only paperwork and photons, yet my exceptionally usual magic finally mattered. <words>458</words>
The doll head blinked farewell and settled into silence, as if relieved that a caretaker had at last arrived. <words>477</words>
I locked the room and stepped into the wheat, carrying boredom like a steady flame, excitement paced beside me like a dog. <words>499</words>
