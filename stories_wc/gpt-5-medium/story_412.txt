My work begins during meditation sessions, when the receivers stop hissing and the station's air settles into listening. <words>18</words>
Here at the frequency monitoring station, I breathe between blips, book in hand, blade hidden in a penciled margin. <words>37</words>
They call me a bookish assassin because I annotate exits, bibliographies, and breathing patterns with the same cramped diligence. <words>56</words>
I am geographically challenged, forever misreading maps, yet I never lose the coordinates of a pulse or a secret. <words>75</words>
The transmissions belong to the secret keepers, a lattice of voices that trades truths like weather, predictable but devastating. <words>94</words>
They speak in cycles, and the cycles breed dreams, and the dreams return, a looped reprimand I endure to learn. <words>114</words>
Through cyclical nightmares repeating themselves, I memorize their code not by translation, but by ache, by exactly where it hurts. <words>134</words>
During meditation sessions the supervisors think I soothe interference, yet I soothe only the tremor of my trigger finger. <words>153</words>
I came here to establish a new order, one where secrets serve mercy, not markets or monarchs or men like my father. <words>175</words>
On my lanyard dangles a boring rubber key cover, gray as chewed gum, protecting a key that opens no earthly door. <words>196</words>
Its wards turn only inside a caretaker console, aligning the tuner with a forbidden frequency the Keepers call the Library. <words>216</words>
Books never soothed me like that hidden shelf of hums, where every chapter is a coordinate and every paragraph a face. <words>237</words>
Because I am geographically challenged, the nightmares guide me instead, returning me to the same hallway until I understand its turn. <words>258</words>
Each loop ends at a room where my target waits, a woman whose whispers stitched the network, a matron of careful betrayal. <words>280</words>
I was raised by secret keepers, and still I am hired to prune them, proof that devotion doubles as a poisonsmith. <words>301</words>
She sees me misname the corridors, hears me recite footnotes under my breath, and smiles with mournful elation like a chapel's echo. <words>323</words>
You are late by miles again, she says kindly, and I realize she has been soothing my aim through the humming walls. <words>345</words>
The consolatory tone is the trap and the mercy; it invites me to end her and rewrite the order gently. <words>365</words>
I unlock the Library with the gray cover, twist the dial, and our voices braid, two threads warming in a cold machine. <words>387</words>
We speak the location of our meeting wrong on purpose and right for our nightmares, so the cycles know where to return. <words>409</words>
When I finally move, it is to soothe her folded hands, and to file the blade back into my annotated heart. <words>430</words>
Outside, the station resumes hissing, and the new order begins as a quiet, geographically challenged map drawn by haunted librarians. <words>450</words>
