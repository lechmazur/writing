At the instant the frozen computer finally restarted, the orchard lights flickered across rows of pears rooted in concrete. <words>19</words>
The toppled skyscraper lay like a fallen spine, its floors reclaimed orchard farmland, windows composted into soil trays and escalators repurposed as terraced irrigation. <words>43</words>
I had come as a bluffing swindler, sleeves full of charm, pockets threaded with promises, tongue practicing rehearsed contrition. <words>62</words>
The farmers called themselves gleaners, energetically lethargic in gait until the harvest bell, when stillness snapped into swift choreography. <words>81</words>
I swore I could magnetize donors with my pitch, pull coins from air, pull mercy from boardrooms, pull headlines from silence. <words>102</words>
But the truth I carried, the one nobody dared to handle, was heavier than bronze pears chilled by shadow. <words>121</words>
It rode in my chest like a seed stone, hard, flavorless, impossible to swallow without cracking teeth. <words>138</words>
A dropped book made it tumble toward light at last, because that is how our meet-cute finally happened. <words>156</words>
She was up a ladder cataloging graft notations when her field journal slid off a rung and fanned open. <words>175</words>
Pages fluttered across the orchard aisles, carrying sketches of root repairs and notes about sap whispering through rebar veins. <words>194</words>
I bent to catch one, our hands collided, and the prickly quiet between us ripened with gentle harshness. <words>212</words>
Her name was Lio, and she wore a blank price tag safety-pinned to her vest as a vow. <words>230</words>
Nothing here is for sale, she said, only for saving, and the tag reminds every buyer of their weight. <words>249</words>
My grin, trained for cons, faltered; my invisible allies stirred, the quiet wind, the code under my rebooting laptop, the bees. <words>270</words>
The laptop had frozen mid-grant, and at that exact restart chime I felt every unspoken helper choose a side. <words>289</words>
I confessed my profession, a swindler whose bluffing funded good things by accident, and terrible silences by design. <words>307</words>
Lio did not step away; she asked what truth bucked inside me, bruising the ribs I wrapped with patter. <words>326</words>
I told her the donors wanted the orchard only as mirror, not refuge, a prettied ruin magnet for their absolutions. <words>346</words>
They would rename rows after themselves and salt the roots with publicity, leaving your pears glossy, your soil starving. <words>365</words>
My confession tried to make me smaller; instead, something in the toppled tower seemed to lean closer, listening. <words>383</words>
Lio placed the blank tag in my palm and wrote one word with a carpenter pencil: steward. <words>400</words>
You want invisible allies, she said; become visible accountability, and they follow. <words>412</words>
So we planted another ladder, another row, and let the computer hum witness. <words>425</words>
