<story>After the reef dies, evening emptiness sharpens the harbor into a narrow vastness of purple sheen and cold echoes. [19]
Along the blooming jetty at twilight, a gloom-hill coachman guides his mule-drawn cart over salt-slick boards. [35]
He once drove soldiers, but now he carries a collection of dried seed pods in burlap sacks. [52]
The jetty blooms despite the salt because he has learned to fertilize the cracks with patient mixtures. [69]
He brews them from kelp ash, bone dust, and pulverized shells that once housed the music of coral streets. [88]
He can hear where to spread them by understanding bird calls, the gulls turning scouts for wind and root. [107]
They wheel, complain, and bless, mapping pressure lines across the inlet that only patient ears can read. [124]
He speaks dead languages, too, syllables learned from chipped stones and damp parchments in the chapel on Gloom Hill. [143]
Those tongues unseam the wind, and the birds answer when he names them by the names their grandmothers forgot. [162]
In that exchange, he keeps a submerged concord alive, a treaty between brine memory and seed breath. [179]
The old battlefield lies beyond the jetty, where the shore grass grows in broken ranks around rusting cannon wheels. [198]
Once, the reef guarded the harbor, and men fought here with smoke and scripture and salt light in their eyes. [218]
Now the reef is a pale grave, the fishes exiled, and the fortifications lean toward sleep. [234]
He returns each dusk to let a garden reclaim the battlefield, as if growth were an apology that breathes. [253]
He cracks the pods with a coachman's care, thumb and palm finding the seam the way reins find quiet. [272]
The seeds rustle like crows' feet on vellum, a small thunder promising leaf, flower, and fruit. [288]
He trudges past shell holes now filled with rain, slicing open burlap and shaking out future in measured arcs. [307]
The birds whistle a latitude of calcium and wind, telling him where the soil remembers and where it forgets. [326]
He hums back in a dead tongue, thanking the gulls for their grammar and the starlings for their consonants. [345]
The mule waits, blinking, and the cart settles as if listening to a sermon about patience and tide. [363]
At the jetty edge, where planks are braided with morning glory, he kneels and tips a palm of ash and seed. [384]
He does not pray; he translates, and the translation is heavy with brine and the soft clatter of pods. [403]
Voices drift from the harbor smooth as weed, the dead languages finding new mouths in the tide's drawn breath. [422]
They speak of submerged concord, the pact between drowned reef and living shore, written in silt and hunger. [440]
He answers by salting the wounds of earth with sweetness, pressing pods into mud where blood once argued. [458]
He will fertilize not with conquest, but with listening, letting calls and currents choose the beds. [474]
He thinks of the coach road on Gloom Hill, the cliffs like folded knuckles, the lanes a wrist of stone. [494]
There he learned how to turn tightness into passage, and he brings that craft to this shore. [511]
Narrow vastness is a road, he tells himself, a small path through an ocean too wide to hate or love. [531]
The garden will not argue; it will hold, and the holding will quiet the ghosts without dismissing them. [549]
He plants soldiers of dill, fleets of poppies, and the flags of nasturtiums that love salt like gossip. [567]
He tucks their spines with his thumb, soothing quarrels the way he once soothed horses in rain. [584]
The sky thins to coin-silver, and the first bats delete gnats from the air, leaving a margin for fragrance. [603]
He sits on the cart and recites a stone prayer in Phoenician, a tongue that smells of rope and sail. [623]
The words are salt-bitten but sturdy, and the water listens, unarmed now that the reef has fallen to bone. [642]
In the pause between syllables, the birds revise their map, and he follows it to a pit of bayonets asleep. [662]
He pulls them out like rotten roots, stacks them into a lattice, and trains morning glory to climb. [680]
The lattice looks like surrender and stays like shelter, catching the salt and tempering the wind for tipsy seedlings. [699]
He feels the treaty tightening around the harbor, a submerged concord made visible in the way silence moves. [717]
When darkness comes, the jetty glows with star-flowers and moth wings, and the battlefield unlaces under green. [734]
He gathers the empty pods, still whispering, and stores them for tomorrow in the cart beside the reins. [752]
Then the gloom-hill coachman clicks to the mule, and together they cross the blooming jetty, narrow as mercy. [770]</story>
