<story>I arrived at the abandoned carnival prize redemption center just as the carousel lights flickered without power, a rumor pretending to be electricity. <words>23</words>
People think smugglers swagger, but I am even-tempered, a still pond smuggler who lets ripples speak for me. <words>41</words>
Tonight, my job was to offload relics the city suddenly considered illegal, though yesterday they were only curious prizes behind dusty glass. <words>63</words>
I tied a tattered silk scarf around my wrist so I would remember where I started if the night looped. <words>83</words>
Elegant chaos is an art form here, painted in claw marks on plywood and confetti that never learned to fall. <words>103</words>
I moved aisle to aisle, cataloging every cracked plastic ring, every tarnished coin, every blue ticket that still remembered hands. <words>123</words>
The crates waited like anxious gulls, and my client expected delivery by dawn, when a regretful letter remains unsent because dawn never answers. <words>146</words>
I am systematically rebellious, which is to say I break rules by method, using inventory lists like crowbars and silence like rope. <words>168</words>
To preserve hunting techniques that predated permits, my people hid them inside toys, whistles tuned to teach the listening parts of animals. <words>190</words>
These whistles are what I meant to offload, before ignorance sharpened into policy and policy into raids that emptied our forests of trust. <words>213</words>
I opened the first crate and felt the vibrations of intent humming through the wood, like bees spelling out a verdict. <words>234</words>
They were tuned differently tonight, as if the whistles had learned grief and would only teach a softer step, a cleaner arrow. <words>256</words>
I checked my timing by tracking star patterns through the cracked skylight, mapping routes across booth roofs, the way my mother mapped migrations. <words>279</words>
Her last note sits sealed at home, a regretful letter remains unsent, and it keeps my hands honest even when profit beckons. <words>301</words>
I packed the whistles into nondescript plush bears, stitched with a rhythm my grandmother kept for weather, which is to say warning. <words>323</words>
A guard dog nosed the doorway, uncertain, catching the new humility in the air and lying down like a folded map. <words>344</words>
I left tokens in the open cases, plastic crowns and paper roses, so the thieves who follow would steal nothing of consequence. <words>366</words>
Then the lights bumped once, a bruise of current, and I heard footsteps speaking the old language of urgency and mistaken heroism. <words>388</words>
I wrapped the tattered silk scarf tighter, a compass that points to beginnings, and slid into the shadowed ball-toss lane. <words>408</words>
There, among prizes no one claimed, I waited for the stars to say go, and for mercy to arrive first. <words>428</words>
