Dusty starlight sifted through the cracked skylights of the found object museum as my wheels whispered across terrazzo.<words>18</words>
I am a careful poisoner, curator by title, skater by necessity, tracing gentle arcs between display cases to test the edges of gravity.<words>41</words>
Tonight I had set a trail of cryptic clues hidden in a scavenger hunt, a puzzle that only muscle memory could read.<words>63</words>
The hunt threaded past an elegant rapier with a cracked hilt, its blade reflecting me as a question mark on polished glass.<words>85</words>
I carry it sometimes, not to threaten, but to authenticate the bravery of anyone who dares mirror my reckless grace.<words>105</words>
They call my creed a code of instinct, a manual written in bruises, balance, and the careful timing of breaths between broken lights.<words>128</words>
I am innocently guilty, dosing risks into the night like bitters into water, never enough to kill, always enough to tell the truth.<words>151</words>
Outside, the park clattered, and inside, amid skateboarding, echoes stacked into constellations I steered through with deliberate, dusted patience.<words>170</words>
The first clue was taped beneath a mothballed boombox, a map of arrowed scuffs drawn in wax where only wheels could really read.<words>193</words>
The second glittered from a jar of obsolete keys, each key a gull, each label a rumor, all pointing toward a broken mezzanine.<words>216</words>
There, the rapier waited, its cracked hilt hiding a capillary of glass where my measured poison shone like patient frost.<words>236</words>
I had invited Rook, a prodigy with ankles like quicksilver, who wanted nothing more than to test the edges of gravity.<words>257</words>
Rook entered breathless, saw the clues, and followed, reading wax and dust as if language were a skate line upon old tile.<words>279</words>
At the mezzanine, I offered the blade and a sip, telling him the dose would tilt his inner ear toward honesty, no farther.<words>302</words>
He watched me drink first, then nodded, lips shining with winter, and the room swayed not with menace but with sudden precision.<words>324</words>
We rolled together and he solved the last lock, tracing the rapier to a case where provenance hid like a drifted star.<words>346</words>
Authenticate, he whispered, and I felt the museum shiver as if the building exhaled, as if the past finally recognized our balance.<words>368</words>
Somewhere high, dusty starlight rearranged itself, and the cracked hilt sighed, releasing a tiny scroll that named the maker and my teacher.<words>390</words>
Rook read aloud and grinned, understanding that the poison was a tempo, that the test was a lantern, that I meant him to survive.<words>414</words>
In the hush that followed, wheels hummed, the rapier kissed its sheath, and our shared code of instinct wrote itself across the floor.<words>437</words>
If guilt still clung, it felt harmless and bright, the kind you brush from sleeves before pushing off into another quiet night.<words>459</words>
