<story>When I reached the time-frozen village, my steps made no echo, yet dust rose as if listening. [17]
Even the clocktower pigeons were suspended clouds of wing and doubt, and far away the storm muttered in sleep. [36]
During the lull of distant thunder, I felt my exile curl tight around my throat, then loosen thoughtfully. [54]
I am an exiled chess tutor, trained to read patterns of ambition and remorse, and I had failed both. [73]
A prince once learned from me how to win kings by sacrificing villages, and the lesson burned a kingdom down. [93]
I had come here to forgive myself for past mistakes, if forgiveness could be winnowed from silence. [110]
The village square held a fountain shaped like a platinum labyrinth, a mirrored maze whose channels reflected stalled rain. [129]
Water trembled inside its threads of light but did not fall, so I could trace the intended journey of each droplet. [150]
Every surface carried a woven hush, as if a loom had seized the moment and pressed it flat and listening. [170]
I, who fidgets productively, moving tokens and aligning edges, turned misfortune into a map between my fingers. [187]
From my satchel I drew the travel board, its knights scarred with teeth marks from hours of haunted practice. [206]
I set a knight on the fountain lip and watched it regard the platinum labyrinth like a pilgrim regards a shrine. [227]
There was a hall near the square where banners hung in the stopped wind, and I entered to meet the silence. [248]
Inside, a tapestry swallowed a wall, its border frayed like a coastline, its heart crowded with figures frozen mid-speech. [267]
I recognized the game required of me, not on a board, but in the weave where decisions hold and break. [287]
The tapestry showed the village moments before the thunder ceased, cups lifted, mouths open, eyes brimming with unsaid wisdom. [306]
I knew what had caged them, because I had taught men to trap choices like this, to freeze opponents while smiling. [327]
So I decided to winnow the stillness, teasing the kernel of time from the chaff of regret without letting it scatter. [348]
The method came to me the way openings come, a quiet check disguised as courtesy. [363]
I would unspool the woven hush by decoding frayed threads in a tapestry's border, reading them like moves in a line. [384]
Each loose end curled toward a figure in the scene, a barmaid, a mason, a child with a paper boat. [404]
I touched one strand and felt a memory squeeze my ribs: the prince, pouring wine, telling me strategy must ignore pity. [425]
Another thread scratched my palm, like the rasp of a door closing on a hospital room we should have funded, but did not. [448]
I breathed until the fierce repose I needed settled in, steadier than fear, more stubborn than shame. [465]
Then I began to count, knight's pace, L-shaped, across the border knots, skipping like a horse over traps of habit. [485]
When the count landed on a thread that pointed to the mason, I tugged gently, and air stirred the smallest fraction. [506]
A line of dust fell from his suspended chisel, a gray second returning to the river of time. [524]
I moved to the figure of the child and found another thread, thin as a hair, knotted around a paper sail. [545]
I loosened it, and nearby the fountain whispered, water daring to slip a step inside the platinum labyrinth. [563]
With each right pull I felt the village inhale, with each wrong brush I tasted ashes from the kingdom I had burned. [585]
The storm rolled without rolling, a held drumbeat, reminding me that pauses can also be choices, and choices can also be pauses. [607]
I reached the center of the border, where threads frayed into near-invisibility, and there the pattern became a problem set for two. [629]
Either I could release the village entirely, at once, or I could let their time return in careful increments, lesson by lesson. [651]
The first would be satisfying, like a brilliant sacrifice, but I knew how that story ended for others. [669]
So I chose the longer method, as a tutor does, asking the day to show its moves and learn from correction. [690]
I tightened some threads into new anchors and loosened others into paths, until the woven hush became a breathing hush. [710]
The barmaid blinked and finished her joke, but softer, as if hearing her own kindness return to her. [728]
The mason set his chisel down and looked at the child, whose paper boat found a tiny current and sailed bravely. [749]
I left only the clocktower pigeons still as thoughts, so that I might always remember that some flights must wait for weather. [771]
When I stepped back into the square, the thunder sighed and moved on, and the platinum labyrinth at last overflowed. [791]
I began to forgive myself. [796]</story>
