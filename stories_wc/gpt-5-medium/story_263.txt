<story>
I guide tourists through the coral reef city, delivering nature walks with the gravity of confession and the grin of mischief. <words>21</words>
They think I am a reformed docent; I am actually a zealot assassin on sabbatical, narrating an epic from the villain's view. <words>43</words>
Humorous solemnity keeps them listening while I slip knives of perspective between jokes, a calculatedly playful surgery on their inherited certainties. <words>64</words>
I begin with a faded carnival prize plush, my only trophy, bleached coral pink, missing one eye, stuffed with legends instead of foam. <words>87</words>
The plush once dangled above a rigged booth where I learned that justice, like rings tossed at bottles, ricochets more than it lands. <words>110</words>
Today, during nature walks, I lift the toy as a reliquary and ask the sea to mirror us with the reflection of morality. <words>133</words>
Waves answer through reversed echoes, replaying my steps backward so that sins appear as lifelines and heroics as anchors drowning bright fish. <words>155</words>
I tell the children that villains conserve ecosystems because lairs require stable tides, and that heroes, forever storm chasing, churn nurseries into rubble. <words>178</words>
They laugh, then look disturbed, which is the hinge I need to consolidate attention before opening the vault where motives grow slippery. <words>200</words>
I describe the coral reef city as a cathedral of polyps who tithe sugar and build stained glass out of trapped light and patient time. <words>225</words>
Through tunnels, sea slugs slither like mischievous ushers, and mantis shrimps ring bells whose colors punch harder than fists. <words>244</words>
Here I staged my quiet executions, each target a pilgrim who mistook conquest for charity, and my blade a docent correcting misread placards. <words>267</words>
The plush rode in my pocket, a talisman reminding me that prizes are usually payments for illusions, and illusions are efficient scaffolds for truth. <words>291</words>
To the tourists I confess that I preferred villains because they respect boundaries; they build walls to keep monsters in, not neighbors out. <words>314</words>
I teach them call and response, speaking our guidebook lines forward while the reef answers backward, and together we hear ethics harmonize through reversed echoes. <words>339</words>
When the tide slumps and algae lace the avenues, I stage a mock trial, letting children prosecute my plush for accessory after empathy. <words>362</words>
I defend it, and myself, by arguing that mercy is geometry: triangles of choice, angles of harm, reflections that never meet their sources. <words>385</words>
Our verdict arrives as bubbles, each popping like a punchline, and solemn humor salts our tongues until we taste the villain's patient devotion. <words>408</words>
So we consolidate our camp of listeners into a troupe, rehearsing the epic anew, this time with motives polished like shells instead of swords. <words>432</words>
At dusk I return the faded carnival prize plush to my pocket, and the reef's reversed echoes whisper that forgiveness swims in circles. <words>455</words>
