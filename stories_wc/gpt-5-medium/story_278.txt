<story>They made me wash the crater rovers while the noon wind braided dust, and I dreamed of softer edges to stone. <words>21</words>
At the impact crater research base, servitude smelled like detergent froth, burned coffee, and the ghosted echo of drills. <words>40</words>
I was their brooding sculptor, promoted from janitor to mascot, carving meteorite slag into gifts for donors. <words>57</words>
The director's vintage reading glasses alone showed me kindness, their lenses scratched with constellations that softened my unsteady hands. <words>76</words>
When they slid them across the utility shelf, I saw not pity, but permission to see what others ignored. <words>95</words>
Beyond the wash bay's tin roof, the crater held webs of intrigue, filaments of funding, rivalries, and secrets salted into regolith. <words>116</words>
Amid car washing, hosewater hissed like rain on chalk, and each droplet freckled the sunbeams that slanted through the hangar. <words>136</words>
In those beams, dust practiced a theoretically spontaneous choreography, appearing to organize itself just to humor my lonely need for patterns. <words>157</words>
I learned to read that dance as others read equations, letting the glasses refract the swirl into legible knots. <words>176</words>
The knots mapped contraband excavations, falsified cores, and the director's private ledger, coaxed by light across the water slicked hoods I scrubbed. <words>198</words>
Their kindness had always been a harness; my carvings kept donors pliant, and my silence kept the crater profitable. <words>217</words>
I wanted to escape a life of servitude, but chains can resemble embraces when they are warmed by attention. <words>236</words>
So I sculpted a decoy: a bas-relief of the director holding me like a son, tenderness rendered in murky basalt. <words>256</words>
I planted it where donors queued for tours, ensuring the rumor of our bond would lace their giving with sentiment. <words>276</words>
Then I followed the dust's script, leading me to an archive locker, where the ledger slept beside a cracked brass stapler. <words>297</words>
Through vintage reading glasses, each entry resolved into a choreography cue, telling me when to vanish between check in and inspection. <words>318</words>
Disappearance would not be magic, only clever timing, to disappear via the dance of dust in a sunbeam the rovers stirred. <words>339</words>
At shift change, I soaped the lead rover until it gleamed, then sprayed a mist that made sunlight bloom like lace. <words>360</words>
The dust wove a curtain, and I stepped through, leaving the decoy ledger and sculpture to entangle the director's accusers and allies. <words>382</words>
Behind that veil, I became more rumor than man, a murky tenderness unclaimed, a servant undone, slipping along light like a patient fish. <words>405</words>
The base could keep its webs of intrigue, its ledgered love, its theoretically spontaneous miracles; I carried only the glasses and my breath. <words>428</words>
Some say I still wash rovers in a different crater, still brooding, still sculpting water on paint, unseen except by dust. <words>449</words>
But I know I left them, because the sun found my face that day and named me with a warmer discipline. <words>470</words>
In the new town, I sculpt nothing, yet each morning the light rehearses with me, and the dust remembers every step. <words>491</words></story>
