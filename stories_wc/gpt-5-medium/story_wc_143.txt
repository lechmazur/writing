<story>I reached the moonlit summit long before the crews, when the crater was only a silver bowl holding a slow breath. [21]
They call me a crater inspector, but tonight my task felt older than the agency, older than the antennae below. [41]
I had come to photograph the last of something precious, and to prove it had ever been here at all. [61]
In my pocket, the Nightwatch's hourglass sand grain clicked inside a tiny glass ampoule, a kept star from a vanished guild. [82]
My mother had been Nightwatch, keeping time by lantern and sand before satellites taught the sky to buzz like a hive. [103]
I was purposefully curious, the way you become when every answer feels like a door to another losing. [121]
The crater's rim was ragged with fresh strikes, pepper of the space age, spent hulls and honest stones dropped from black streams. [143]
Each pit recorded a visitor whose name we would never know, a ledger of urgency burned into basalt. [161]
Below us the radio dishes turned, combing for whispers, while above us the moon made fossils of our shadows. [180]
I set the camera on the lip and unpacked my messages, a line of vials nested in cotton like eggs. [200]
Electronics failed here when the solar wind bit down, so I had built a timing kit that worked with patience and fire. [222]
Each vial held reagents that woke when dew kissed them, using chemical reactions for timed messages that burned color into the dark. [244]
Blue meant ten minutes to dawn, ochre meant five, and the last vial would exhale white silence at the exact hush I sought. [267]
I flicked the ampoule and let the Nightwatch's grain fall onto the first pad, a perfect seed to start the condensation. [288]
When the droplet formed, it crawled, met its partner, and a clean flame licked up like a polite throat clearing. [308]
The blue plume rose and drifted into the crater where the air was stillest, drawing a ghostly breath from the bowl. [329]
I checked the focus where the basalt mosaic met a seam of ancient snow, what should not exist and yet persisted. [350]
The last of the glacier moths slept in that seam, a folded page no one had learned to read before we tore the book. [374]
Tonight it would wake, warm its trembling instrument body, and let a final song rattle the dawn the way frost does on wire. [397]
I wanted the picture because that rattle had been my childhood lullaby, and because a picture sometimes outlasts its subject. [417]
But also because the agency needed proof before they would spare funds to freeze eggs and memories in liquid nitrogen. [437]
Down-slope, a dish turned to a satellite that kept dropping stray light like confetti, and I muttered a curved prayer at it. [459]
The space age gives and takes, I thought; it maps the night, and then it writes its name across the map. [480]
Another flame coughed ochre, five minutes, and I could hear the dawning hush sneaking up the ravines like a soft-bellied tide. [501]
A delicate scratching rose from the seam, then a wing like a shard of milk-glass unfurled, catching the moon and keeping it. [523]
I slowed my breath, thumbed the old camera, and watched the white vial as if it were the throat of a long-distance friend. [546]
When it sighed, the moth lifted, and the crater became a cathedral where the only sermon was the sound inside my ribs. [568]
I pressed the shutter; the mirror slapped; the timed message blushed to nothing, leaving the air as thin as a vow that will hold. [592]
For three beats of my pulse the moth hovered above the basin, its abdomen like a lantern that refuses to admit it is dying. [616]
Behind it the radio array flashed a red eye and went blind again, as if embarrassed to witness something too intimate for circuits. [639]
I thought of my mother on tower stairs, of sand sighing through an hourglass, of the small ways we say I am here. [662]
She had told me once that keeping watch did not save the night, it simply kept the night from leaving alone. [683]
The moth made a soft collision with my sleeve, dusted me with a century, and then climbed into a brightness no one could indict. [707]
I did not cry, but the crater and the summit and the moon conspired to make my throat clean and still. [728]
I packed the vials, each stained lip a fossil of time, and fed the camera one more strip of breath and silver. [750]
The photograph would outlast me, outlast the array, outlast the confident satellites that quilted the dark with numbers and noise. [770]
But it would not outlast the hush, because the hush was dawning, and the dawning hush belongs to no archive but breath. [792]</story>
