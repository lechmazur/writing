<story>
I am a hermit beekeeper stationed on the quasar observation deck, where dark glass hums beneath my boots. <words>18</words>
Through the hush of distant galaxies, I listen for the faintest signals and the even fainter stirrings inside myself. <words>37</words>
I came here to become a master of strategy, because bees taught me that every move is a weathered vow. <words>57</words>
Beside the spectrometers, my brass measuring cups gleam like small planets ready to hold sugar, pollen, or precise hope. <words>76</words>
I knead honeyed dough for morning bread, pressing warmth into flour the way gravity presses light into a quasar ring. <words>96</words>
My questions are sweetly confrontational, gentle as smoke yet insistent as wings tapping a visor in vacuum. <words>113</words>
I chart radio bursts via the pattern of animal tracks in the snow etched across a memory of winter fields. <words>133</words>
Each pawprint becomes a constellation, each drag mark a Doppler smear, and strategy reveals itself as practiced listening. <words>151</words>
Isolation is a mixed blessing, a hive without stings yet also without dancing maps to share heat. <words>168</words>
Tonight a signal rises like a swarm, spiraling with rhythms that taunt the neat measure of my cups. <words>186</words>
I answer with sweetness and challenge, adjusting gain, tasting the air, and sliding calibration weights like nectar stones. <words>204</words>
Fox, hare, and elk once taught me routes, and their prints now march across the screen as elegant equations. <words>223</words>
I set the brass measuring cups around the console, tiny resonators catching stray hums, turning error into timbre. <words>241</words>
Like dough, a plan must knead back, offering resistance that tells the hands where the next patience belongs. <words>259</words>
So I nudge the cosmos, sweetly confrontational, asking it to explain its hoofprints across my lonely pasture of glass. <words>278</words>
The reply drifts through the hush of distant galaxies, a braided whisper of prime numbers and bee dances. <words>296</words>
I read it via the pattern of animal tracks in the snow, a strategy of pauses, leaps, and cunning detours. <words>316</words>
It speaks of mixed blessings, of nectar that ferments, of victories that bruise, of losses that open silken doors. <words>335</words>
To become a master of strategy, I must tend both bees and stars, keeping them warm without smothering their wildness. <words>355</words>
I measure a cup of honey and pour it into the dough, a contract between breakfast and the night sky. <words>375</words>
While I knead, the pulse counter ticks, and I feel the plan click, humble as a seed and fierce as spring. <words>396</words>
Magnificent simplicity settles over the deck, a clear hive of light. <words>407</words>
I bow, sweetly confrontational still, and follow the tracks onward. <words>417</words>
