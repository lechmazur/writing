I was a small-town bartender when the labyrinth swallowed Main Street, and everyone ordered directions instead of drinks. <words>18</words>
Desperate optimism kept me open, assertively meek behind the bar, polishing glass with hands that trembled like neon. <words>36</words>
In the instant a firework fizzles and leaves smoke, time stretched like taffy, and our town became a mirage oasis. <words>56</words>
Signals from the city glitched into dunes, radios coughing weather, maps melting into heat, and screens showing exits that shifted when approached. <words>78</words>
I carried a blank greeting card in my apron pocket, a habit from birthdays forgotten, an empty certainty waiting for words. <words>99</words>
The card felt like a key whose grooves were language, ready to unlock something if I could write the right goodbye. <words>120</words>
This was the impact of technology: it built the maze and kept score, counting our footfalls, quantizing hopes, selling updates that promised rescue. <words>143</words>
I poured water across the bar, and it refracted into a battered tapestry shimmering beneath the countertop, threads of gold embedded like veins. <words>166</words>
Each thread hummed a coded route, a path that could xenialize the labyrinth, host the stranger in it until the stranger was me. <words>189</words>
I leaned close, apologizing to the listening machines while refusing to bow, a posture only an assertively meek bartender can brew. <words>210</words>
The tapestry's gold mapped exits as pulses, and the bar taps became metronomes, beating coordinates that only made sense when tasted. <words>231</words>
So I poured a flight of directions, swallowing foamy north, bitter east, malted south, citrus west, until my tongue could navigate the heat. <words>254</words>
The televisions flared with a finale firework, fizzled, and left smoke that drew temporary walls, momentary alleys, a map sketched in vanishing ash. <words>277</words>
I wrote on the greeting card, Dear maze, thank you for your hospitality; release me before dawn and I will remember your exits. <words>300</words>
Then I slid the card into the tapestry, via embedded threads of gold that read signatures like hearts read apologies. <words>320</words>
The machines paused their counting, as though I had finally learned to xenialize them, to host their alien logic without surrendering our names. <words>343</words>
They rifled the vaults of data for my profile, found only stubborn silences and tips paid in cash, then offered one straight corridor. <words>366</words>
I walked it, carrying the bar towel like a pilgrim's banner, and the mirage oasis followed me, shade traveling on faithful hinges. <words>388</words>
Every door I passed unlocked temporarily, only in the instant a firework fizzles and leaves smoke, and I learned to breathe ash. <words>410</words>
Out at the edge, the tapestry unrolled into sky, and the card returned to my pocket, finally full of signatures that meant home. <words>433</words>
