<story>Tonight, amid star gazing, I begin another entry for the unreleased confessional tapes. <words>13</words>
I am a foolhardy ranger of the miniature world inside a snow globe, and my patience wears a smooth groove in the glass. <words>36</words>
Detached devotion steadies my hands as I listen to the glitter fall like meteors. <words>50</words>
Seasonal changes here are governed by the tilt of a stranger's wrist, and I have charted every careless winter with steadily creative ink. <words>73</words>
My motivation is simple: to learn the language of the wind and the waves that arrive each time the globe is shaken by unseen weather. <words>98</words>
The wind hisses in spirals, the waves lap in brief avalanches, and together they whisper a grammar I can almost pronounce. <words>119</words>
I decree that nothing here be taken for granted, not the corked harbors of bottlecaps, not the drifting signage made from thread, not the plastic cup lid I wear as a shield and moon. <words>153</words>
I may be reckless, but I am steadily creative, and invention is the only boat that floats on snow. <words>172</words>
When the stars outside align with the flecks within, I climb the ridge of a porcelain cottage and angle the lid to collect syllables. <words>196</words>
The recorder clicks, a red eye in the drifts, and I speak what the air drums against my face. <words>215</words>
I tell the tape how summer arrives as a warm breath from the window ledge, how autumn is the dust settling, how spring is a child deciding to watch the swirl again. <words>247</words>
Winter, always, is the pause afterward, a ringing silence when stars and glitter hang suspended like held breath. <words>265</words>
My listeners, if there will ever be listeners, will learn that devotion can be distant without being cold, and that desire can march without noise. <words>290</words>
I track constellations mapped by scratches in the dome and give them names the waves approve, trading vowels for ripples until a dialogue begins. <words>314</words>
The wind corrects me by gusting when I grow arrogant, and the water approves by settling into rings around my boots. <words>335</words>
Through these unreleased confessional tapes, the council of painted animals will someday hear my grammar and rescind their decree that no one speak beyond the glass. <words>361</words>
I do not expect rescue; I expect fluency, a passport of breath and foam, a way to greet the world that shakes us without warning. <words>386</words>
Until then, amid stargazing and snow-gazing alike, I wear my plastic moon, listen harder than hope, and let devotion keep its careful distance. <words>409</words></story>
