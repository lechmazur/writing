The thin-lipped warlock arrived when the final calendar page of the year was flipped, as if summoned by paper and dust. <words>21</words>
He walked with formally casual posture into the forgotten library inside an abandoned mine, where stalactites prayed above stacks that remembered everything but light. <words>45</words>
Warnings had been posted long ago, their ink eaten by damp, yet he could recite them from memory and ignore them with equal precision. <words>69</words>
He had come to gorge on the fruit of knowledge despite warnings, certain the tree would thank the appetite that trimmed its burden. <words>92</words>
His fingers, ceremoniously unhurried, optimized the lantern flame, because clarity must be engineered before it can be believed. <words>110</words>
Beside the circulation desk lay a viking ship figurehead fragment, rune-scarred, salt-blistered, and still smelling faintly of voyages that promised land to the sea. <words>134</words>
He greeted it with the courtesy reserved for colleagues, because wood that has watched storms can watch conclusions too. <words>153</words>
Lost artifacts arranged themselves around him, not moved by hands, but by the relief of finally being asked a proper question. <words>174</words>
He spoke with confusing certainty, the kind that makes doubts stand straighter because they think they are being inspected. <words>193</words>
To optimize his mind for what the shelves would risk telling, he swallowed tonics mixed according to rumored cures in discredited textbooks. <words>215</words>
They promised memory with edges, vision without eyelashes, and the good manners to forget fear until fear became offended and left. <words>236</words>
He read the catalogs of vanished dynasties, the shipping logs of expeditions that ended mid-sentence, and biographies written by authors who never admitted to living. <words>261</words>
Every margin note arrived like a small bell, announcing the librarian who had once hidden here and decided silence required footnotes. <words>282</words>
The warlock signed each ledger with a name that behaved itself, then introduced his intentions to the figurehead fragment like a treaty. <words>304</words>
It answered by pointing nowhere, which is where oceans go when maps are peeled from the wall and eaten by the dark. <words>326</words>
Understanding, he laid out a syllabus of quests, each item a lost artifact that had traveled here to resign from being missing. <words>348</words>
He would carry their names like lamps, optimizing routes through rumor, geology, and the bureaucracy that stones impose on those who listen. <words>370</words>
When midnight threaded its needle through the final page, the mine's air shifted, and the shelves exhaled as though overdue fines had been forgiven. <words>394</words>
He stepped into the aisle the way a verdict steps into a courtroom, formally casual, certain the case was his, confused only about winning. <words>418</words>
