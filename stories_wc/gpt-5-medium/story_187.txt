<story>
I, a stoic wanderer, arrived uninvited at the witch's familiar training ground with mud-dry boots and steadied breath. <words>18</words>
I came at the moment a teacher wipes the final formula away, chalk dust floating like moths above restless apprentices. <words>38</words>
I had traveled by following a trail of nightmares only familiars could leave, black pawprints stamped on sleeping minds. <words>57</words>
Across my back I carried a floorboard from an abandoned cabin, its knots storing whispers like drought-hoarded rain. <words>75</words>
I was here to archive ritual practices before the last wild syllables were domesticated into curriculum and forgotten. <words>93</words>
The teacher met me with brash tenderness, a burnt-sage smile that neither welcomed nor refused, but measured. <words>110</words>
Her voice was mesmerizingly bland, like a stream that sounded exactly the same whether it drowned you or washed your feet. <words>131</words>
I told her my name, and three necessary lies to hide the villages that still trusted me with their dead. <words>151</words>
I would not impose, I said; I would only listen, catalogue, and bind memory to wood. <words>167</words>
The floorboard from an abandoned cabin made a sober ledger, its grain begging straight answers to crooked histories. <words>185</words>
Around us, novices coaxed stray shadows into shapes of foxes and owls, then fed them moon-dust from chipped saucers. <words>204</words>
Her sleeve, still chalked, hovered where she had just erased the circle of binding, the final formula fled into powder. <words>224</words>
She asked why nightmares would show me the way if I were merely a recorder and not a thief of meaning. <words>245</words>
Because nightmares remember what daylight edits, I answered, and the ledger wants the whole hymn, even its ash. <words>263</words>
She summoned a half-grown familiar that looked like a mistake a river regretted, and told it to read the wood. <words>283</words>
With mesmerizingly bland patience, the creature pressed its whiskers to the plank, inhaling the story of roofs, rot, and departures. <words>303</words>
It showed me a girl who had hidden spells under that floorboard, and the necessary lies she told to keep breathing. <words>324</words>
I felt a brash tenderness for that ghosted student, and for the teacher who wiped away her fiercest calculus. <words>343</words>
We make necessary lies, I said, not to deceive, but to give secrets a spine so they do not impose collapse. <words>364</words>
Let me keep the rituals as they are practiced, not as they are permitted, and I will guard the names. <words>384</words>
The teacher nodded, imposing one condition as the dust settled. <words>394</words>
Archive us, she said, but leave room for forgetting. <words>403</words>
I left by following a trail of nightmares outward, a compass drawn in sleep, the ledger whispering like a patient hearth. <words>424</words>
