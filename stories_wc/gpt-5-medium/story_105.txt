In the hush of a half-lit corridor, I entered the witch's flying carpet garage with notebooks trembling in my sleeves. <words>20</words>
They call me an outcast scholar, yet the carpets trust my hands the way skittish horses trust salt. <words>38</words>
I am, as even the witch admits, strangely trustworthy when the wind is loud and the bolts are shy. <words>57</words>
Tonight I sought to prove that midnight only lasts so long, no matter how many charms hug the rafters. <words>76</words>
My evidence arrived as a jolt when a shuddering rug coughed up a seashell with a strange symbol. <words>94</words>
The mark spiraled like a pupil, mirroring the soul of whomever dared to press it to their ear. <words>112</words>
In its hush I heard my name echo toward a shoreline I had not reached since I failed my guild exams. <words>133</words>
That echo steadied me into a frantic peace, because proof sings softer than fear when the night is cornered. <words>152</words>
My plan had formed via diaries hidden behind a tile in a public restroom near the docks, unsigned but intimate. <words>172</words>
The pages detailed how carpets were shackled to midnight by borrowed memories that the witch collected from wounded sailors. <words>191</words>
If I could reverse the current, the garage would breathe dawn, and the sailors could sleep beyond the tide. <words>210</words>
The seashell, said the diaries, was a conduit for returning what was taken, a humane aperture rather than a blade. <words>230</words>
I pressed it gently to a carpet's fringe, and the symbol flickered like a lighthouse announcing the year of forgiveness. <words>250</words>
A sailor's whisper spilled out, mirroring the soul that had been knotted there, and the midnight thread loosened. <words>268</words>
The witch arrived, braid crackling, her face wary because she trusts me only to break what refuses to heal. <words>287</words>
I told her the shell did not steal, it returned, and I begged to test it upon her own flagship. <words>307</words>
She laughed, then paused at my strangely trustworthy terror, and allowed me to touch the flagship's tassel with the mouth. <words>327</words>
A jolt traveled the weave, and a girl sprang from the carpet's shadow, the witch's younger self, clutching a broken compass. <words>348</words>
She looked at us, and the garage looked back, mirroring the soul of its maker, until the witch unclenched her hands. <words>369</words>
We stood together in the hush of a half-lit corridor and listened as the carpets exhaled, proving midnight only lasts so long. <words>391</words>
The witch, steadied by loss returned, wept, and granted dawn passage, on condition I archive the method and guard the harbor. <words>412</words>
I promised in writing, via diaries hidden behind a tile in a public restroom, so others would remember when storms misnamed darkness. <words>434</words>
The shell cooled, the carpets hovered like tidebirds at rest, and my exile felt lighter than the moon's shed skin. <words>454</words>
Frantic peace is not quiet, but it hums with repaired engines, and it teaches even scholars how to land. <words>473</words>
