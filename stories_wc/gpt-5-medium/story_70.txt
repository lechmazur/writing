An uptight scribe like me should never have entered the witch's greenhouse clinging to a hill of gravestones. <words>18</words>
Yet the door sighed open, and buried optimism pressed against the panes like ivy asking permission to breathe. <words>36</words>
I came to copy a secret, certainly uncertain about the ethics but steadied by a stubborn ledger of rituals. <words>55</words>
The witch had vanished, leaving only damp heat, cataloged shadows, and an envelope sealed once with curse-laced gum. <words>73</words>
I would earn my answers by analyzing the leftover adhesive from a once-sealed envelope, because ink lies and glue remembers. <words>93</words>
Under cracked glass hung a prototype light bulb from Tesla's workshop, its filament a hair of trapped lightning. <words>111</words>
I cradled it carefully, hoping to cradle empathy in arms of steel, because my heart wore bracers of rules. <words>130</words>
A sigil on the potting bench matched an illustration from the archives, but the final stroke refused to align. <words>149</words>
I felt the moment tilt, that hush of the quiet transformation arriving like snow that knows where every twig belongs. <words>169</words>
My hands shook, certainly uncertain, and the bulb chimed against its clamp with the smallest question. <words>185</words>
I answered not with ink, but with breath, and bellow once to scatter the gnats guarding the black orchids. <words>204</words>
Their flight revealed a puzzle piece of sunlight, a narrow shard that finally slid between leaves and sketch, aligning memory. <words>224</words>
It happened in the moment when a puzzle piece finally fits, the greenhouse clicking shut around a gentler geometry. <words>243</words>
By that click, I read the curse's grammar: the envelope had once held a name, torn away to spare a life. <words>264</words>
The adhesive tasted of salt and thyme and apology, which my ledger had not accounted for, neat columns dissolving like mist. <words>285</words>
I set the bulb on the sigil, wiring its whisper into the soil, and the filament brightened as if remembering summer. <words>306</words>
The gravestones beyond the glass appeared to lean closer, not menacing but curious, witnesses to a contract loosening its knot. <words>326</words>
I copied nothing, instead writing consent, a new entry stating the witch could return without debt if I unlearned my iron alphabet. <words>348</words>
Such terms would punish my order, but the bulb's glow braided itself with the orchids, and the archive inside me softened. <words>369</words>
I was still an uptight scribe, yet the angle of my spine adjusted, a quill daring to curve toward kindness. <words>389</words>
The greenhouse creaked, clinging harder to its hill, and roots tunneled between names, not erasing them, only connecting unfinished stories. <words>409</words>
I gathered the envelope, now honest in its scars, and promised to keep it open whenever mercy needed somewhere to land. <words>430</words>
Steam beaded my spectacles, a veil I lifted slowly, certainly uncertain, and through it I saw the witch's outline forming. <words>450</words>
She stood as if forgiven by the plants, and I, remade, waited without judgment for whatever name she would choose. <words>470</words>
