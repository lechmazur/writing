<story>I was a seasick naval officer long before the sea gave me any rank worth wearing. <words>16</words>
They called me awkwardly charming because I apologized to waves between bouts of nausea. <words>30</words>
That clumsy grace carried me inland, toward the crystal fortress at the end of a rainbow canyon. <words>47</words>
I had come to confront the mirror before it lies again, and to learn why it lied first. <words>65</words>
The fortress rang like glass when dusk touched it, and the air smelled of a translucent ghost orchid bulb. <words>84</words>
I carried that bulb in a silk parcel, a gift from a navigator who traded secrets for clean horizons. <words>103</words>
He told me it could transform a lie into a bloom, but only by tracking moon phases with stubborn patience. <words>123</words>
Every petal would open when a truth was faced, every root curl when a truth was buried. <words>140</words>
My truth was older than my uniform and stretched across the quiet longing of centuries. <words>155</words>
I had plotted the lunar calendar in salt, charcoal, and whispered oaths, arranging nights like steps toward a door. <words>174</words>
The door was a water bright threshold inside the hall of facets, where each visitor met themselves, multiplied. <words>192</words>
I stepped through, seasick on dry land, and found my reflection grinning with medals I had never earned. <words>210</words>
It winked, awkwardly charming as a thief, and asked what price I would pay to be believed. <words>227</words>
I answered with the bulb, and with the memories of maps that marked storms like debts rather than hazards. <words>246</words>
The mirror drank the scent, and the fortress hummed until the canyon rang all its colors awake. <words>263</words>
Petals unfurled within the glass, showing voyages where I did not vomit, promotions I did not want, and lovers I dared not hold. <words>286</words>
None were true, but each was a path I might have chosen if I had traded secrets for comfort. <words>305</words>
The bulb pulsed, counting my breath like tides, and I realized the only transformation I sought was courage. <words>323</words>
So I told the mirror why the sea sickened me, that its sway felt like promises made by shifting governments. <words>343</words>
I declared, in nostalgic defiance, that I would chart my fate by tracking moon phases, not by the applause of admirals. <words>364</words>
The glass trembled, then offered one last fiction, a storm calmed by my orders, and I refused it as a mutiny of the self. <words>388</words>
I confronted the mirror before it lies again by naming my failures, which became constellations threading the fortress rafters. <words>407</words>
They lit a path through the rainbow canyon to the sea, where my stomach steadied and the orchid bulb finally blossomed. <words>428</words>
Its translucent petals held maps of future storms, and I felt myself transform without medals, without lies, without witnesses. <words>447</words>
I turned from the crystal fortress at the end of a rainbow canyon, carrying no rank but a truer wake. <words>467</words>
Behind me, the glass kept watch across the quiet longing of centuries, and I sailed on, awkwardly charming and newly honest. <words>488</words></story>
