At the vapor collection facility, I worked as a professional dream interpreter with a peculiar faith in the meanings that condensed from breath. <words>23</words>
The machines thrummed during baking, when trays of salt and silver cooled the air and caught the whispers that workers exhaled between shifts. <words>46</words>
I stored each dream in vials, labeled by temperature and the quiet pulse I felt puddling beneath my gloved fingers. <words>66</words>
Some pulses were occasionally frequent, arriving like hushes that repeated, insisting that repetition could be its own code. <words>84</words>
On a Sunday morning, a crumpled invitation appeared in my locker, smelling of iodine and bread, promising a conclave beneath the evaporators at noon. <words>108</words>
It claimed that the city statutes had begun to calcify, thickening like scale on our pipes, and that only dreamwork could dissolve the grip. <words>132</words>
I kept reading because the paper mentioned my secret aim, to rewrite laws carved in stone without breaking a single sign or seal. <words>155</words>
The method proposed was unthinkable and exacting, by impersonating a missing person whose approvals still opened red corridors in the municipal archive. <words>177</words>
I knew her, the absent night auditor who taught me to weigh the difference between a nightmare and a lawful omen. <words>198</words>
She vanished after filing a report that dreams were statutes attempting to breathe, and that breath was a ledger nobody dared to reconcile. <words>221</words>
I pressed the crumpled invitation flat with a warm tray, and the letters bled outward like icing, revealing a passage below the kiln. <words>244</words>
During lunch, while loaves finished baking, I followed steam to a hatch where three elders of condensation greeted me without expression. <words>265</words>
They spoke in the quiet pulse, tapping copper with wet knuckles, and asked whether I would carry the night auditor through my mouth and my name. <words>291</words>
I agreed because dreams had already taught me that identity is a vessel, and vessels belong to the liquid they dare to contain. <words>314</words>
That night I returned wearing her brass badge, moving with her slow stance, and the archive doors opened like teeth willing to taste a memory. <words>339</words>
I placed vials along the review table so the statutes could inhale what workers had exhaled, and the codes softened, then bent, then rewrote themselves line by line. <words>367</words>
It was not forgery but a sacrament of governance, a peculiar faith in respiration, where obedience would be measured by the freedom of each breath. <words>392</words>
Outside, alarms were occasionally frequent as boilers shuddered, but inside the archive the quiet pulse held steady, and the city learned to exhale. <words>415</words>
When I returned the badge to the hatch, the elders nodded, and I understood that laws should never calcify where people still wake, work, and dream. <words>441</words>
