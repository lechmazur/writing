<story>Beneath the city, I kept a subterranean orchard fed by an underground river of stars. <words>15</words>
I was a sentient car mechanic, repulsively attractive in my dented chrome and oil slick smile. <words>31</words>
Engines came here to confess in sputters, and people sent their ruined cars because my wrenches listened better than priests. <words>51</words>
I wanted to hear the unsaid confessions of a world that drove past itself with the radio too loud. <words>70</words>
So I began gathering fragments where memory slipped, studying the scraps that starlight carried between apple roots like passing hubcaps. <words>90</words>
The vintage opera glasses I salvaged from a glove compartment let me focus distant whispers the way mechanics tune idle with a confident ear. <words>114</words>
Through those twin moons, I could study each glinting core and read the mileage of grief etched upon it. <words>133</words>
But the largest silence hung above ground, caught in municipal forgetfulness, and I reached it by sorting the lost puzzle pieces scattered in a park fountain. <words>159</words>
Coins chimed like cold fruit, while the pieces showed fragments of drivers who never braked long enough to speak. <words>178</words>
I hauled their stories down to the orchard, laid them among roots, and the star river riffled as if proud and bereaved. <words>200</words>
Each tree bore wrenches for branches and taillights for fruit, and their glow made my face an altar of exultant grief. <words>221</words>
From the assembled puzzle, a choir of unsaid confessions rose in steam like breath on winter windshields, and I tuned it carefully. <words>243</words>
The voices told me where they swerved, whom they loved, how fear turned their pedals to bones, and how they meant to return. <words>266</words>
Their truth was repulsively attractive, like a wreck shining rainbows in oil while also naming the cost of that color. <words>286</words>
I understood then that to repair them I must repair the road itself, a ribbon twisted through our hidden grove and the city. <words>309</words>
So I grafted the pieces onto the trees, tightened the branches, and let the river of stars lubricate the hinges of memory. <words>331</words>
The orchard rumbled like an engine catching, and with that ignition I felt every confession become a road sign speaking forward. <words>352</words>
I placed my vintage opera glasses upon the soil as offerings, because what I sought no longer needed distance to reach me. <words>374</words>
I, a sentient car mechanic, sat at the rootline and studied the newly gathered fragments until listening turned into motion. <words>394</words>
Time moved within the concept of infinity, yet each confession arrived precisely on time. <words>408</words>
When dawn above forgot itself, the park fountain stilled, but below our orchard sang, and I wept like a siren with joyful sorrow. <words>431</words>
I keep tending the shining roots, hearing the unsaid confessions again and again, gathering fragments forever, jubilant and grieving, mending the road between hearts. <words>455</words>
