<story>At T minus one, the screens freeze and the air settles like ash.<words>13</words>
I sit in the abandoned spaceport waiting area, palms open to a future that refuses to land.<words>30</words>
They call me an underdog magician because my miracles prefer velvet dust to center stage.<words>45</words>
And still I work in the final second of a countdown that never finishes.<words>59</words>
My instrument is a brass microscope salvaged from a shuttered clinic near Gate Nineteen.<words>73</words>
By tracking sun patterns through cracked skylights, I calibrate its lenses against the station dust.<words>88</words>
I hunt for a mathematics of dreaming, to decode dream symbols stamped into lint and skin oils.<words>105</words>
Rebellious placidity guides my breath as I listen for the stalled rockets whispering mutiny.<words>119</words>
The subtle uprising begins not with shouting, but with a pattern of light nobody bothered to trust.<words>136</words>
Hours here leave me drainingly invigorated, tired as a tide, charged as a storm veiled in fog.<words>153</words>
When the PA coughs its looped warning, I cringe, then smile at the courage hiding in my flinch.<words>171</words>
Plastic seats yawn in rows, their gum scars mapping constellations of former departures and lies.<words>186</words>
Through the microscope, I read old travelers, their smudges spelling rivers, birds, and locked doors.<words>201</words>
Where the sun strikes at T minus one, those symbols flare, aligning like teeth on a key.<words>218</words>
If I turn the key, the doors will not open, but their hinges will remember their purpose.<words>235</words>
The countdown never finishes because someone wanted endless readiness, a universe of almosts to rule.<words>250</words>
My plan is quiet as mildew, a subtle uprising aired in daylight, disguised as maintenance.<words>265</words>
By tracking sun patterns, I time the flicker when the second hiccups, and plant mirrors to bend it.<words>283</words>
Then, through the brass microscope, I aim a thread of glare into the control room like a threader.<words>301</words>
The glare stitches the dream symbols into command glyphs on their dead panels, a patient graffiti.<words>317</words>
I am drainingly invigorated because each faint change feels like dragging a moon with fishing line.<words>333</words>
The cameras think I am cataloging rust, but rust is how metal remembers touch and revolt.<words>349</words>
When the looped second lurches again, the mirrors wink, and the rockets exhale a syllable of doubt.<words>366</words>
That syllable matches the river I decoded earlier, the route cut by anyone who refuses to wait.<words>383</words>
In the rows, a few sleepers stir, as if their dreams received the memo and passed it along.<words>401</words>
We do not storm the launchpad; we adjust its shadow, a protest measured in sunlit correction.<words>417</words>
Rebellious placidity means holding the line while the line learns it can become a circle.<words>432</words>
In the final second that never ends, I set the last mirror, tiny as a tear, heavy as a vow.<words>452</words>
The panels blink, the waiting area breathes, and the dreams finally speak a word simple enough to follow.<words>470</words></story>
