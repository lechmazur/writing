<story>
I am a fretful archer pacing cool corridors of an ancient egyptian palace under a ceiling of falcons. <words>18</words>
In my quiver rattles a crumpled recipe, greasy with tears and spices, a map of kitchens and memories. <words>36</words>
The guard fires drift like incense, and I carry daring caution like a breathing charm against panic. <words>53</words>
I have come to perform a story before the court, hesitantly bold, yet steadied by the bow like law. <words>72</words>
My motive is sharper than any arrow, to see the world through unfiltered eyes, and free my breath. <words>90</words>
I have practiced the power of storytelling by listening to ghosts that speak through jumbled tv subtitles from foreign channels. <words>110</words>
Their captions fluttered across the sand of my mind, mistranslating truth into riddles I could finally approach. <words>127</words>
So I veer from the training yard and enter the pillared hall where the king waits with jackal calm. <words>146</words>
In his lap lies an old photograph, and during the moment an old photograph starts to fade, he sighs like a dune. <words>168</words>
Its edges blur as if time were salt, and courtiers whisper about omens and vanishing heirs. <words>184</words>
This is when the palace needs a tale that can steady the present by untying the past without breaking it. <words>204</words>
I bow, and my voice, hesitantly bold, opens like a small gate into desert wind and kitchen fire. <words>222</words>
From the crumpled recipe I read the order of seeds, the patience of simmering, the law of shared bowls. <words>241</words>
I tell how a mother fed an orphaned prince, and how truth arrived in steam when no herald dared enter. <words>261</words>
The court leans as if my words were dates and water, and the photograph pauses in its slow vanishing. <words>280</words>
I shoot not arrows but images, and each picture gives the king a choice that will not bruise the future. <words>300</words>
He asks how stories can alter what a lens has trapped, and I answer that lenses trap only what fear points at. <words>322</words>
I speak of glances that veer from cruelty, of children learning names, of spices granting memory, of bows that rest. <words>342</words>
The subtitle ghosts return, stumbling lines across my mind, yet illuminating like torches behind gauze, mistruth becoming caution. <words>360</words>
They teach me to balance error and light, and I translate their jitter into a cadence the court trusts. <words>379</words>
The king lowers the photograph, which ceases to thin, and he asks what reward I want for this staying. <words>398</words>
Let me travel beyond the palace, I say, to see the world through unfiltered eyes and guard its stories. <words>417</words>
He grants a small caravan and a scribe, and I tuck the crumpled recipe where my heart and arrowheads meet. <words>437</words>
My last bow to the hall is a quiet vow that the power of storytelling will keep every eye honest. <words>457</words>
I walk out hesitantly bold, guarding daring caution, as if both were twins guiding me between mirage and mercy. <words>476</words>
Beyond the gates, the sky is an unreadable oath, yet I string the tale and aim for tomorrow without trembling. <words>496</words>
