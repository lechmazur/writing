The forgotten library inside the lighthouse smelled like salt and vellum, a spiral of dust and memory turning under a patient bulb.<words>22</words>
I kept it alive across the hush of a borrowed century, because endings learned to pause when surrounded by lenses and shelves.<words>44</words>
Call me the cynical conjurer, humbly arrogant, caretaker of soot ghosts and the small electricity that lingers between lamps and waves.<words>65</words>
I stayed to harness the ephemeral, the breath of fog, the last glints of twilight, the almost that history cannot seem to keep.<words>88</words>
On the central table waited an astronomical globe, bruised with fingerprints, its latitudes creaking whenever the windows trembled.<words>106</words>
I spun it nightly to hear the constellations complain, to watch faded rings measure shipwrecks no chart would confess.<words>125</words>
The sea kept me company in shared isolation, two beings practicing distance while thirsting for signal.<words>141</words>

The fog listened, then wrote us in pale ink across the hush of a borrowed century.<words>394</words>
Its letters hung among lamps, trembling, until the globe steadied and the shelves dared to breathe.<words>410</words>
