<story>After the old record player scratches its last tune, the wasteland orchard breathes and rattles, thriving oddly amid radioactive dust storms. <words>21</words>
Beside the skeletal trunks stands a headstrong mage named Ilex, cloak snagged with thorns and eyes practiced at catching unnatural light. <words>42</words>
He tends these stubborn branches with merry bitterness, determined to bring color back to a gray world that forgot its own chords. <words>64</words>
In his satchel clinks a stained glass box, its panes patched from chapel ruins, its latch hungry for a truth he keeps postponing. <words>87</words>
He gathers spells through the residue of glitter on a once-sparkling costume he wore when cities still applauded their favorite illusions. <words>108</words>
Back then he promised someone forever between encores, and he left before dawn, too dazzled to ask forgiveness, too frightened to confess. <words>130</words>
Now, after the old record player scratches its last tune, only the orchard listens, its fruit clicking like muted metronomes. <words>150</words>
Ilex is tenuously certain the trees want honesty more than water, and he approaches them as if approaching an audience in blackout. <words>172</words>
He lifts the glitter from his cuffs, lets it drift, and whispers a charm to feminize the storm, softening its gargle into silk. <words>195</words>
The dust whirls curtsy-shaped, the apples stop coughing, and the orchard, in this strange quiet, dares to remember the spectrum. <words>215</words>
The stained glass box warms like a heart under stage lights, but the latch refuses, as if color itself demands testimony. <words>236</words>
Ilex clears his throat, tasting ash and sugar, and finds the courage to confess that he abandoned love to chase portable applause. <words>258</words>
He admits he stole this very orchard from a dying map, and he watered it first with tears he pretended were rain. <words>280</words>
The trees rattle like patient jurors, then bend, brushing his forehead with radioactive leaves that kindle a careful, shimmering forgiveness. <words>300</words>
The latch sighs open; inside rests a prismed seed and a letter addressed to whoever survives bitterness with a laugh. <words>320</words>
The letter, written in his younger hand, instructs him to plant the seed at the orchard's bruised center and keep singing. <words>341</words>
He kneels, shakes the last glitter from that once-sparkling costume, dusting the hole like sugar, and hums the vanished club's chorus. <words>362</words>
The ground drinks the sparkle, feminized winds tuck the clouds, and a sapling erupts, stained with impossible blues, reds, and joyous wounds. <words>384</words>
Ilex laughs with merry bitterness at himself, because color returns not as absolution but as work, a palette that stains every choice. <words>406</words>
Still, after silence replaces the record player forever, he keeps tending the orchard through radioactive dust storms, stubbornly coaxing fruit that teaches the world to see again. <words>433</words></story>
