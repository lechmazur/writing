After the last swipe of paint completes the mural, the recycling center exhales an ozone hush. <words>16</words>
Bins hum like patient beasts, sorting chrome bones, glass scales, and worn memories. <words>29</words>
I arrive as the neon dries, a detached swordsman in a futuristic city that files souls by material category. <words>48</words>
I am lovingly detached, which means I care enough to carry distance like a blade kept clean. <words>65</words>
The street artist packs up quietly, leaving a bin of collage scraps under a stenciled joke about destiny. <words>83</words>
Everyone knows you should not meddle with another maker's leftovers, but vows are hungry things. <words>98</words>
I pull the street artist's bin into the sorting light and begin reassembling the scraps, not to steal, but to summon. <words>119</words>
This is my method, learned from the secret weavers who knot futures out of what the city throws away. <words>138</words>
They taught me to cut only where kindness can grow. <words>148</words>
Their loom is rumor, their thread is attention, and their shuttle is timing. <words>161</words>
I have come to consecrate an impossible vow: to wield the sword so that nothing is severed. <words>178</words>
The mural's last wet shine reflects a shard in my palm, a piece of sea pottery smoothed by years and turbines. <words>199</words>
I found it on the littoral landfill, a bruise-colored crescent that once belonged to a cup that tried to remember tide. <words>220</words>
The scrap collage becomes a map as my hands move, and playful seriousness steadies them as humor would steady a ladder. <words>241</words>
Plastic logos turn into constellations, receipt curls to rivers, a foil label to a moon, and the pottery piece to a harbor. <words>263</words>
In that harbor I place my sword, not into water, but into pattern, letting its shadow become a mooring line. <words>283</words>
The secret weavers slide close, unseen yet audible, because gossip bends around them like steam around polished steel. <words>301</words>
Their laughter ticks the vents, and I hear the lesson again: to bind a city you must bind yourself last. <words>321</words>
So I meddle with my own story, carefully rearranging its scraps until the oath fits like a hinge. <words>339</words>
I name the vow aloud, not as command but as invitation, and the bins answer with soft glass applause. <words>358</words>
My sword stays sheathed, yet every seam in the collage sharpens, turning edges into agreements, arguments into bridges. <words>376</words>
The mural dries into a witness, its colors recognizing the harbor, the moon, the mooring line, and the patient blade. <words>396</words>
I press the sea pottery into the center, and the harbor holds, a sanctuary cut from leftovers and kept by intention. <words>417</words>
The secret weavers nod in the air like clotheslines taking wind, and the vow lights up the sorting belts. <words>436</words>
From now on I will cut only to join, step only to steady, and fight only to keep hands meeting. <words>456</words>
