After a single note lingers in total quiet, I stand between fossilized dinosaur bones and sketch the boundaries of light across their ribs like an unruly map. <words>27</words>
I am a hopeful sculptor in a museum that is theoretically free, though my pockets remember every coin I did not spend on courage. <words>51</words>
At my thumb turns a puzzle ring that refuses to come apart, a metal knot from a failed love, glinting like a tiny trap. <words>75</words>
I came here to turn a relic of failure into a new beginning, by carving its memory via the texture of bark on an old tree. <words>101</words>
The work hums with excited boredom, the kind that sparks when repetition becomes a door and patience pretends to be a drumbeat. <words>123</words>
I measure the femur shadows, then the skull's grin, trying to map how darkness detonates against bone and where light chooses to stop. <words>146</words>
These are the boundaries of light, I tell myself, not rules but negotiations, like hands deciding how far they can hold before they must let go. <words>172</words>
Each fossil is a stopped gesture, an almost that became stone, a chord cut off after it learned to sing for one long breath. <words>196</words>
After that single note lingers in total quiet, even my heartbeat feels curated, thudding like a docent's polite cough behind velvet rope. <words>218</words>
I fear that if I force the ring, my chest will implode, so I sketch instead, tracing bone edges until graphite learns to breathe. <words>242</words>
A child asks why dinosaurs died, and I answer that sometimes the sky forgets to be gentle, but art remembers how to make new weather. <words>267</words>
I rub paper against a cast of vertebrae the way my grandfather taught me bark rubbings, and the texture arrives like a road back home. <words>292</words>
He carved with his palms first, reading the world via the texture of bark on an old tree, then let the knife confirm what touch already knew. <words>319</words>
He told me that I was theoretically free, which meant the key was mine but the lock would keep arguing, a puzzle disguised as permission. <words>344</words>
So I lower the ring into my palm like a comet cooled to jewelry, and I ask the bones for mentorship in patience and aftermath. <words>369</words>
Their silence answers with a grin of enamel and stone, advising me to let things stay whole until a new shape begs to be born. <words>394</words>
When I finally twist the ring, I do not force it; I rotate it along the boundaries of light, and the knot loosens like twilight. <words>419</words>
In that small mercy, the relic of failure turns, and I begin again, excited, bored, and bravely patient, while the museum exhales its deep, old hush. <words>445</words>
