Between rides, I slip into the dark matter diner, where gravity pours like coffee and conversations orbit the jukebox. <words>19</words>
A burnt-out general sits in the corner booth, uniform threadbare, medals dulled to ash by campaigns even victors lose. <words>38</words>
He orders dried seaweed, brittle scrolls that crackle like tide-maps, and beckons me with a smile equal parts court-martial and carnival. <words>59</words>
We trade shared anxieties the way servers trade shifts, sliding plates of dread and saucers of hope across the slick cosmic counter. <words>81</words>
His voice is rationally absurd, building syllogisms from smoke rings, arguing that an empty holster can still shoot holes in silence. <words>102</words>
I answer with mischievous wisdom, confessing how I photograph patrons not by faces but via arcs in black-and-white photographs. <words>121</words>
Each frame catches the trajectory of their fears as if worries were comets that only appear when someone refills the sugar. <words>142</words>
Between rides, the booth becomes a war room where we plot small uprisings against panic, including the coup of deep breathing. <words>163</words>
He says he is here to dethrone fear from the throne of reason, and he needs an accomplice with a camera. <words>184</words>
So we draft a treaty on a napkin, its preamble stained with espresso, its clauses written in crumbs of salted kelp. <words>205</words>
The general explains that armies dissolve but maps remember, and maps pinned properly can march ideas farther than boots ever will. <words>226</words>
I show him my wall of photos, arcs looping from brow to cup to door, cartographies of tremor stitched in grayscale stitches. <words>248</words>
Together we rotate the frames until the curves align, a constellation suggesting how to renew courage without pretending danger is gone. <words>269</words>
It is mischievously simple: place fear under oath, cross-examine it with jokes, then let reason judge with both eyebrows raised. <words>289</words>
The waitress brings extra dried seaweed, saying heroes need salt, and the general salutes with two fingers, as if blessing tide. <words>310</words>
We crumble the green sheets over our treaty, edible laurels that taste like skylines drowned and rescued, then lick our legal fingers. <words>332</words>
Outside, cabs blink like patient nebulae, drivers calculating breaks, and the diner hums equations that add up to temporary belonging. <words>352</words>
The general leaves half his medals as payment, each disk a moon for my wall, each scratch an orbit for somebody braver. <words>374</words>
He promises to return between rides, to report on skirmishes where laughter outflanked terror, where maps marched and no boots hurt. <words>395</words>
Alone, I develop the night in trays of memory, and those black-and-white arcs brighten, like reason unseating fear without bloodshed. <words>415</words>
The diner door swings, the cosmos drafts itself again, and I hang our treaty beside the kettle, steam making it official. <words>436</words>
When the next stranger enters, I will offer seaweed, a seat, and the mischievous oath: let us reason, and dethrone fear. <words>457</words>
