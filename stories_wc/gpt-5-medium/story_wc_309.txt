I was an underachieving mage who had failed every glamour exam, so I took the stairs no one watched. [19]
They spiraled toward an icebound spire above the clouds, where rumor said light remembered what people forgot. [36]
I went because my city had begun automating imagination, and I needed a place that resisted templates. [53]
I wanted to find the sacred in the simple, a spark not optimized into a product. [69]
The spire was said to hold a lingering luminance, the afterglow of intentions never finished. [84]
That light, people whispered, accommodated mistakes like a patient teacher and accommodated impossibilities like a generous stage. [101]
I had brought only a cracked compass, the garden folly keystone stolen from a public square, and my good boots. [121]
The keystone once capped a useless arch designed by a bored duke, but I had heard it was cut to open the sky. [144]
At the last landing, fog braided up the risers like gray rope, and I tried mist walking for the first time. [165]
It worked badly, because I had never been good at precise vanishing, but it let my feet skip the broken steps. [186]
When I emerged on the platform, the cold rang like a tiny bell in my teeth, and I laughed without meaning to. [208]
The brilliant dimness began as a mood, then as a smear of color hovering above the snow-cut parapets. [226]
I unstrap the keystone from my pack, hands burning in the wind, and set the wedge of stone into a notch nobody else sees. [250]
The notch is the absence of a brick, a refusal in the masonry that seems to breathe if you stare long enough. [272]
I have been told that the keystone was never meant to bear weight, only to insinuate a joke into gravity. [292]
But the spire accommodates impossibilities, and the stone clicks into the empty space like a tongue finding a missing tooth. [312]
Light spills out as if it had been waiting behind me the whole climb, a lingering luminance pouring forward to greet its own shadow. [336]
It is not bright; it is thoughtful, a pause that gives you back the half-finished whisper you discarded for being unmarketable. [357]
Down in the city, this is the season when creativity gets automated, and every idea is run through a mill that sands off splinters. [381]
Here, the light refuses to know my name, and so I am allowed to be several possible people at once. [401]
I test the keystone by tugging it, and the entire platform flexes like a sail, making a quiet shape the sky understands. [423]
Colors arise not as beams but as condolences: sea-glass green for the mornings I slept through, rust for projects I left half built. [446]
I kneel, and the sill of light drops to meet my forehead the way a kind elder tilts a lamp for reading. [468]
When I breathe, I exhale doubts, and they become white moths that cannot find the flame because the flame is listening instead of burning. [492]
I think of the word underachieving as a lid someone else screwed on, and I think of the word mage as a fragile cup I never filled. [519]
The light does not fix me, but it shows me a bowl carved from cloud, and the bowl has room for rain, salt, and unreasonable laughter. [545]
I realize the keystone is not a key but a question: what could you build if failure stopped bruising pride and started nourishing attention. [569]
I remove the stone and the light dims to a hush, yet that hush stays on my hands, a glove of lingering luminance fit for ordinary work. [596]
On the descent, I practice mist walking not to skip steps but to feel them, each cold edge teaching me a wheel within a wheel. [621]
By the time I reach the low streets, the season of automated arts has begun to hiss from every kiosk, selling inspired sameness. [644]
I set up a table offering nothing but blank paper and a chair, and people line up as if they might find a lost relative. [669]
They sit, they breathe, they wait, and I watch the hush on my hands scatter like seed into their pauses. [689]
Out of those pauses, a low glow returns, a brilliant dimness that is not mine and therefore perfectly theirs. [708]
I tell them the spire accommodates impossibilities, but the street does too, when someone listens without harvesting the moment for profit. [729]
In time, my reputation shifts from underachieving mage to patient caretaker of questions, which is just another way to say apprentice forever. [751]
When night comes, I climb once more to unstrap the keystone because I refuse ownership, and the spire deserves its own empty joke. [774]
The fog takes me back softly, mist walking without steps, and the sky closes around its question mark with a satisfied, flickering smile. [797]
