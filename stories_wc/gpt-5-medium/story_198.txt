I keep watch over the floating island cloud gazing platform with a tenderness that claws. <words>15</words>
They call me a fervent caretaker, and I accept the name like a vow carved into mist. <words>32</words>
Yet I serve only because I must escape a parallel dimension that echoes every step I take. <words>49</words>
The proof of the trap hums in a rustic spinning wheel bolted to the railing, forever turning without thread. <words>68</words>
I suspect it masks the sky, and unmasking the truth is the only road home. <words>83</words>
The island is oddly faithful to its rituals, as if loyalty were a looped song it cannot stop singing. <words>102</words>
So I test the sky by following sun trails across the vapor, mapping angles with chalk on my palms. <words>121</words>
At the final step down a worn flight of stairs that spirals to the platform edge, I begin to hear voices. <words>142</words>
They hiss that the wheel is sacred, that to question it is to mangle my duty and court the fall. <words>162</words>
But a fragile ferocity hardens my breath, and I anchor my toes against the trembling stone. <words>178</words>
I feed the spinning wheel a thread of sunlight stolen from the trails, and the spokes stutter like teeth. <words>197</words>
The clouds peel back, not drifting but painted onto a glass dome that tilts whenever the wheel slows. <words>215</words>
My island has been curating my gaze, binding me to a horizon just close enough to pet. <words>232</words>
I was hired to tend the visitors, to hush their fears, to keep their picnics clean, and I believed the script. <words>253</words>
Now I see the visitors are reflections, trapped correspondences from the parallel dimension where my first self still sweeps a museum hallway. <words>275</words>
To escape, I must invert the exhibit and let the dome unlace, even if the fall rips my name to ribbons. <words>296</words>
I seize the wheel with blistered palms and force it backward, a cruel lullaby that warps the painted weather. <words>315</words>
Each click blooms into a corridor of light, and I follow the longest sun trail toward a door etched in air. <words>336</words>
Behind me the voices promise to mangle my memories, to make me oddly faithful again, docile as a weather vane. <words>356</words>
I descend toward the light, and at the final step down a worn flight of stairs the dome shatters into salt. <words>377</words>
Air rushes like a river of feathers, and the platform floats free, a raft of stone learning a gentler gravity. <words>397</words>
In the clearing brightness, I finally unmask the truth that held me, and it loosens its claws. <words>414</words>
I step through to my first self, still sweeping, and we breathe as one, a caretaker fervent for freedom. <words>433</words>
Together we will be oddly faithful to the world itself, finding our way home by following sun trails anew. <words>452</words>
Our ferocity is fragile, yes, but it belongs to us now, and no wheel will turn without our consent. <words>471</words>
