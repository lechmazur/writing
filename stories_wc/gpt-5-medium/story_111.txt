<story>
I brew beneath the city plaza, in a secret dog park that the night dogs remember better than men. <words>19</words>
I am the deserted alchemist, and the dogs keep my confidences while the cauldron speaks in vapor. <words>36</words>
Tonight I keep stirring during brewing, a redundancy that calms me, because repetition is the smallest liturgy. <words>53</words>
I have come to wrestle a dream from oblivion, and the recipe is older than the plaza itself. <words>71</words>
It asks for water that remembers, which I read through the patterns in the rings of a pond after a stone is thrown. <words>94</words>
There is a shallow pool where the fire hydrant leaks, a mirror that dogs consult with grave snouts. <words>112</words>
I drop a pebble and breathe, savor the widening circles the way a monk savors bells at dawn. <words>130</words>
My gift is theoretically intuitive, not learned from guilds that deserted me when the funding fell silent. <words>147</words>
I do the proofs by feeling, a calculus of trembling knuckles and patient dogs who refuse applause. <words>164</words>
The dilemma of faith arrives on schedule, a rival ingredient I can never clarify or remove. <words>180</words>
Do I trust the water to remember, or do I impose my will like a cheap moon on loyal tides? <words>200</words>
From my coat I take a golden typewriter ribbon, coiled like a serpent that promises letters for prayer. <words>218</words>
It once hummed in a machine that wrote speeches for visionaries who forgot their dogs and their vows. <words>236</words>
Now it is ribbon and relic, and I feed a length into the water so ink may darken the rings. <words>256</words>
The circles take the stain like memories accepting guilt, radiant and black as a bruise of joy. <words>273</words>
The dogs begin to run, not barking, but orbiting the pool as if rehearsing their own afterlives. <words>290</words>
In their motion the plaza above trembles, and commuters pause, sensing a secret park in their ankles. <words>307</words>
I read the rings, the widened vowels of water saying yes and no in the same breath. <words>324</words>
Faith means pouring even when absence pours back, grief exultant because it proves capacity for savor. <words>340</words>
So I lift the ladle and the dogs bow, and I name the dream I wrestle by its lost syllable. <words>360</words>
Oblivion loosens, not defeated but persuaded, like a tired god taking a seat at the edge of play. <words>378</words>
The brew thickens into a cordial with the taste of rain on a library roof, and I sip. <words>396</words>
It is sweet and salt, exultant grief, faith brewed from the dogs and the ribbon and the rings. <words>414</words>
When the trains thunder above, the dream breathes, and the park shakes like a bell nobody can unhear. <words>432</words>
