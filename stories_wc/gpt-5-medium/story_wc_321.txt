<story>It was the hour when clocks run sideways, and the river pretended to flow uphill. [15]
I was the ardent ferry deckhand on the vanishing commuter ferry, sweeping dew from benches nobody properly sat. [33]
We left the pier each dawn and arrived only sometimes, like breath held too long and released ragged. [51]
Our schedule was a rumor posted in fog, but the commuters kept queuing with practiced hope. [67]
I stayed resiliently positive, polishing rails that flickered between metals, greeting ghosts and salaries with the same grin. [85]
The captain said our vessel belonged to a contract carved into tide, but tide kept editing clauses. [102]
At night I listened to the bulkheads hum like a beehive of calendars renegotiating days. [117]
That was when the radio began to catch voices we had never carried. [130]
They spoke with my name, but their sentences swerved like gulls dodging the spray of missing landings. [147]
I tuned the dial slowly, aligning the hiss with the tremor of the rudder underfoot. [162]
The captain ordered me to shut it off, but I heard myself beg for a minute more. [179]
We were approaching the spectral grotto under starlight, a troublesome shortcut along the umbral bend of the route. [197]
The grotto scraped our masts with constellations, and the ceiling dripped letters that spelled delay. [212]
Inside, the water lay still as varnish, mirroring stars that belonged to different decades. [226]
I kept my broom, and in my pocket, the empty hourglass the harbormaster had thrown away. [242]
He said it lost sand to whatever counted faster than us, and now it counted nothing. [258]
But in the grotto, the hourglass filled with starlight dust, and the radio found my voice again. [275]
This time I sounded older, an echo that had gone forward, then returned with explanations. [290]
You want to merge parallel timelines, the voice confessed, because you are tired of losing arrivals. [306]
You think a ferry should choose a side of the shore and keep it. [320]
I whispered yes into the receiver, though I had never said it aloud to myself. [335]
The voice told me the method: via interconnected patterns the river solved its own equations. [350]
Every wake we left inscribed a lattice on the current, a net of promises and absences. [366]
If I aligned the lattice with the star patterns mirrored in the grotto, the ferry could choose. [383]
Choose what, I asked, and the radio crackled like frying rain. [394]
Choose to be permanent in its transience, or transient in its permanence, the voice said gently. [410]
The captain snorted, but I was a permanent transient already, living aboard and never truly ashore. [426]
I traced broom bristles in the spilled starlight dust, sketching loops that matched our wake from Mondays past. [444]
The patterns clicked like teeth, each curve biting a mistake and holding it. [457]
I radioed the wheelhouse, instructing the helmsman to drift exactly where the ceiling dripped next. [472]
He laughed that a deckhand could set a course with a broom, but obeyed because we had tried stranger. [491]
The boat grazed a seam of cold, and the stars in the pool twitched like stitched eyelids. [508]
I flipped the hourglass, and the dust tumbled not down but across, sliding from future to present. [525]
The commuters held their breath the way morning holds frost, and even the seagulls tucked in their remarks. [543]
Across the grotto ceiling ran veins of light, and through them threaded our wake, knot by knot. [560]
I saw every morning we had ever failed glimmer like a lost oar just under the surface. [577]
The captain nodded once, as if finally admitting my maps were not drawn on paper. [592]
Sound bent, and the radio broadcast silence shaped like doors. [602]
One door led to a pier where I had never been late, another to a river without tides. [620]
I chose the door that kept the tide, because promises mean little without their undertow. [635]
Our bow kissed the threshold, and the deck bloomed with frost in the shape of timetables. [651]
The commuters returned their tickets to their pockets, as if each stub preferred to be a pocket-watch. [668]
The hourglass stood upright on the capstan, shining inside with ash colored like dawn before the alarm. [685]
I felt the ferry steady under me, the way breath steadies after grief learns its rhythm. [701]
We emerged from the spectral grotto under starlight into morning that still looked nocturnal, which felt honest. [718]
The pier awaited, not a rumor but a plank exactly where memory and maps had agreed. [734]
We docked with a softness I only hear at funerals and weddings, those places where endings and beginnings braid. [753]
Farewells became arrivals, and arrivals did not vanish; they simply moved through me and kept going. [769]
I remained an ardent ferry deckhand, resiliently positive, sweeping dew where each footprint finally agreed to stay. [786]</story>
