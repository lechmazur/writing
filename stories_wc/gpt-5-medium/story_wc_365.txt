<story>In the murmur of half-remembered dreams, I returned to the abandoned spaceport repair bay. [14]
I am a sensory map maker, and the bay was my oldest, unfinished chart. [28]
Every surface smelled of ozone and rain, a stale promise of worlds departing without me. [43]
In my pocket, a green glass shard ticked against the pulse of my ribs. [57]
It was once a canopy sliver from Shuttle Kestrel, and it refracted everything I felt. [72]
I had kept it since the evacuation that never happened, when someone chose to redirect destiny. [88]
The shard remembers the color of alarms, a planetary aurora poured into cheap tempered glass. [103]
My maps are not lines, but scents, textures, vibrations, gradients of pressure and hush. [117]
They are woven between worlds because I travel best by weaving between worlds. [130]
To chart, I listen, then I leap, cyclically spontaneous, obedient to rhythms that reappear unbidden. [145]
When the rhythm crests, I splice coordinates through parallel universes and step without closing my eyes. [161]
Each universe agrees on smell before arguing about color, and smell was my doorway tonight. [176]
In one strand the repair bay gaped, bright with frost and coughs of sleeping coolant. [191]
In another, tools had arranged themselves around an absent mechanic like a prayer wheel. [205]
I touched the hanging chains and felt their echo in versions where they were snakes. [220]
None of that frightened me, because fear is a scent and I can sort scents. [235]
I had come to discover the weight of a withheld truth, not to flee decor. [250]
My mother had been dockmaster here, vigilant and indelicate, the kind of guardian who laughed seldom. [266]
After the failed evacuation, she refused to tell me why the bay locks sealed themselves. [281]
She died with that refusal, the shard in my hand reflecting her closed mouth back. [296]
Tonight I would ask the bay, because metal keeps better records than prideful silence. [310]
I pressed the shard against a terminal, its edge a crude prism focusing the residual photologs. [326]
Green light spilled, and I let it wash my eyelids until the threads aligned. [340]
Through parallel universes, the same moment repeated, changing increments like a muffled metronome. [353]
Engineers shouted in one, whispered in another, and chose silence in a third that sang. [368]
A console message flickered across the possible bays, always the same command: REDIRECT FUEL PRIORITY. [383]
In each strand, a small figure reached upward, my age then, my height, my freckles. [398]
The figure is recorded from behind, a child shaped like me, hand hovering toward destiny. [413]
The hand lowers, hesitates, rises again, cyclically spontaneous, yielding to a rhythm grown inside chaos. [428]
The button is touched, and across worlds I hear fuel couplers sigh, red lights breathe deeper. [444]
A hiss, a spark, a chain of exits becoming entries, all of them redirected. [458]
In one world nothing happens, in another the Kestrel smolders, in a third our heat blooms. [474]
I watch my own back, bending closer, and learn the first curve of the withheld truth. [490]
I was the one who pressed REDIRECT, obedient to a pattern that moved me like tide. [506]
My mother knew, and her silence had been a hatch bolted by love and terror. [521]
The weight arrived as a smell, heavy metal and rain, and I accepted it evenly. [536]
To measure it, I redirected my breathing and mapped the ache as if mapping wind. [551]
I tuned the shard again and asked the bay for one more thread, the aftermath. [566]
In a seldom-visited universe, my mother lifts me down and covers the console with her coat. [582]
She whispers nothing, only squeezes my shoulder until our pulses redirect each other toward breathing slower. [598]
She looks directly at the security lens and deletes the log everywhere she can find it. [614]
Where she cannot, time will fade it, or I will, by weaving between worlds until the sharpness rounds. [632]
But I do not erase myself, because a map that lies becomes only decoration for ruins. [648]
I keep the record and redirect the path outward, toward the people who survived by accident. [664]
I walk the bay in waking and in dream, laying markers like lanterns for them. [679]
Each marker corresponds to a smell, and each smell points to a door still ajar. [694]
I do not forgive the child or blame her; I fold her into the chart. [709]
The shard warms against my palm, green as planetfall, and I weigh it without flinching. [724]
I have measured the truth, found it heavy, and woven it into routes others can survive. [740]
When I leave, it is through parallel universes gently aligned, a bay unlocked across differences. [755]
Out there, I redirect the lost, one heartbeat per world, until our cycles meet again. [770]</story>
