Before sunrise, the hospital ward felt like a lucid puzzle humming inside the obsidian skyscraper.<words>15</words>
I was the quiet shift, monitoring drips and breaths, when he arrived with a smile that rearranged furniture.<words>33</words>
He introduced himself as a pleasant meddler, openly manipulative, the kind who warns you before moving your heart.<words>51</words>
He carried a pair of rusted ice skates slung over one shoulder, blades ticking like tiny metronomes of departure.<words>70</words>
Visitors are restricted, I said, but he arranged my protest neatly beside the monitors and called it collaboration.<words>88</words>
He wanted to decode ancient symbols etched into the ward windows where night turns its breath to frost.<words>106</words>
I had noticed the pale arcs and stern little knots, like scattered seeds trying to decide which season to believe.<words>126</words>
He said the symbols record a patient migrating through centuries, and that my ward was the appointed shoreline.<words>144</words>
Explain the skates, I asked, and he answered that steel remembers what feet forget.<words>158</words>
He pressed a blade to the glass and traced a curve that matched the pulse of the sleeping oncology wing.<words>178</words>
Some symbols strengthen, he said, and some weaken, and we need the weakening ones to open a path.<words>196</words>
His method was peculiar, via the receding footprints of a nighttime beach wanderer filmed on a trembling phone.<words>214</words>
He overlaid the prints onto the window with damp breath, mapping absence onto frost, and the knots loosened.<words>232</words>
I could see corridors inside the lines, and every bed became a dune, every IV a moonlit tidepool.<words>250</words>
The pleasant meddler began scattering seeds from his pocket along the tiles, barley and buckwheat, a patient geography.<words>268</words>
Each seed marked a symptom, he said, and together they spelled a name only the ward lights could pronounce.<words>287</words>
He was openly manipulative, narrating my doubts for me, yet his voice wrapped them like gauze rather than rope.<words>306</words>
I followed, because confusion felt lucid around him, a clean hallway where every shadow knew its own signature.<words>324</words>
We stepped between monitors while the building murmured, the obsidian skin raising dawn in its mirrored knees.<words>341</words>
He set the rusted skates on a pillow like relics, and the sleeping patient breathed a tidegoing syllable.<words>359</words>
The symbols across the glass reorganized, no longer an illness, but a history stepping backward to meet itself.<words>377</words>
He asked me to read, and I understood enough to begin: weaken the grip of fear, not the patient.<words>396</words>
His footprints faded as alarms stayed quiet, a bargain signed in salt I could almost remember.<words>412</words>
When the sun finally smudged the windows, the seeds sprouted tiny meanings, and the ward exhaled with practiced relief.<words>431</words>
