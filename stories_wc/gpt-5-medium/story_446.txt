On nights salted with soft neon, I work the firefly breeding grounds with the smile of an amiable gambler. <words>19</words>
The field hums like a pocket of patient stars, and my anger stays peaceful, a tide licking limestone. <words>37</words>
I am mildly obsessed with making losses look like lessons and wins look like weather passing. <words>53</words>
The volunteers set up folding tables because throughout charity drives our town gathers here to wager kindness into food. <words>72</words>
I keep a vintage ledger whose leather peels like old bark, smelling of rain and unspooled luck. <words>89</words>
In its margins my grandmother drew coastlines, asking me to restore a lost kingdom the river forgot forever. <words>107</words>
She taught me the art of unbecoming, the slow practice of shedding titles until only duty remains. <words>124</words>
So I deal cards and stories, letting my name dissolve like sugar in tea, inviting strangers to remember their lost roofs. <words>145</words>
When tensions rise, I hydrolyze them with water and patience, turning stubborn starch into soft paste for rebuilding. <words>163</words>
The trick is to guide hands and hearts via the way petals fall from a flower, gentle and inevitable. <words>182</words>
Chance listens when you whisper, and the fireflies agree, spelling cursive promises above jars labeled Aid and Promise. <words>200</words>
I wager my nights on them, trading smooth jokes for crumpled bills that sag against the ledger like wet sails. <words>220</words>
Between hands I study the coastlines, dousing brittle pages so fibers bloom, then lifting a map that appears as if breathed into. <words>242</words>
Ink loosens, prints hydrolyze, and the river routes return like veins to a sleeping wrist. <words>257</words>
I spread word of the lost kingdom without declaring it mine, because unbecoming requires the gambler to vanish behind the table. <words>278</words>
People give more freely when their pride is safe, and pride is cared for best by humor, tea, and decent odds. <words>299</words>
I promise them games where folding is honored, because surrender, not conquest, is the coin that opens childhood bridges. <words>318</words>
Our charity drives become caravans of lanterns, volunteers ferrying soup past rushes where larvae glow like lit seeds. <words>336</words>
I mark every donation and every promise, calculating routes from the ledger to the river, from the river to roofs. <words>356</words>
The plan advances invisibly, via the way petals fall from a flower, each giving its weight to the ground without thunder. <words>377</words>
Peaceful anger keeps me steady when a banker smirks, and I redirect the pot to a widow whose roof has learned to leak. <words>400</words>
By summer's last drive, the breeding grounds surge like a living cathedral, and I announce a journey to rebuild the drowned roads. <words>422</words>
We will carry stones upstream, I say, we will teach the river new manners by remembering the oldest ones. <words>441</words>
The crowd laughs, then signs their names, and my vintage ledger grows heavy with ordinary vows that feel like minted stars. <words>462</words>
If I must unbecome entirely, I will, letting the kingdom rise without a crown, the gambler behind the lights, amiable and gone. <words>484</words>
The fireflies lift, and the ledger shuts, and the river finally remembers our names. <words>498</words>
