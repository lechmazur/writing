I am the grumpy crypt caretaker who sweeps moon dust from thresholds and tonight I step into the witch's crystal scrying room uninvited.<words>23</words>
I carry an unmarked cardboard tube clasped beneath my arm, the night breeze making its cap jiggle like a nervous tooth.<words>44</words>
I have come to read what cannot be spoken, to quell an uprising within that started the day the mausoleum cracked.<words>65</words>
The witch is elsewhere, or so I pretend, because I need her space, its grandiose subtlety, more than her admonitions.<words>85</words>
Starlight threads the ceiling and settles in bowls of water, and throughout stargazing the crystals hum like crickets remembering a single summer.<words>107</words>
I unroll the tube and spill a circle of colored sands, a map of mourning that must be read through the patterns in a sand mandala.<words>133</words>
The grains assemble themselves in multiply singular symmetries, each curve a lone echo repeated, each dot a solitary choir awaiting breath.<words>154</words>
I feel my ribs jiggle with each breath, like bones arguing, the uprising within rattling its wooden sabers against my sternum.<words>175</words>
The mandala accepts a drop of water, then another, until constellations bloom, and the crystals shape the droplets into runes of witness.<words>197</words>
They show me how the dead keep faith by carrying the weight we refuse, and how the importance of trauma is not spectacle but seam.<words>222</words>
I think of the boy who laughed at funerals to keep his eyes from flooding, that boy who grew into me like ivy into iron.<words>247</words>
Sand swirls into a portrait of my first lock broken, my first oath abandoned, and the crystals flare, yet the room remains tenderly dim.<words>271</words>
I understand that the uprising is not rebellion but memory crowding the stairwell, a procession of moments asking for names and water.<words>293</words>
So I lift the unmarked cardboard tube like a bell and breathe across its mouth until it sings, and the sands vibrate toward coherence.<words>317</words>
Through the patterns in a sand mandala I hear apologies I once refused, and I answer them without words, letting the crystals answer back.<words>341</words>
The room, in grandiose subtlety, becomes a sky where the dead do not judge, only arrange the stars so I can walk between them.<words>365</words>
Throughout stargazing the uprising quiets, not defeated but recognized, each clamor given a small lantern and a place in the marching order.<words>387</words>
I seal the tube, tip the board, and let the mandala drift back into the bowl of water.<words>405</words>
When I leave the witch's crystal scrying room, my steps are heavy yet aligned, and the crypt breathes easier because I finally do.<words>428</words>
