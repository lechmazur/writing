<story>During the hush that follows her sudden confession, I keep digging, the steady gravedigger tasked with tending a reimagined Aztec temple's restless grounds. <words>23</words>
Raucous silence crowds the stairways, drums withheld midair, as if echoes hold their breath to see which world will answer first. <words>44</words>
She, the curator who hired me, admits the museum was built to lure the old gods back, not merely to educate paying visitors. <words>67</words>
I keep my shovel steady because I want to preserve ritual practices, not their marketable replicas, and the earth hears motives better than words. <words>91</words>
In my pocket rests a vintage magnifying glass, its brass rim nicked by time, used to study bone marks and the faint glyphs under footlights. <words>116</words>
Tonight a wind slips through the hush of wind passing a broken fence line, and the lens fogs as if a mouth whispers on it. <words>141</words>
When worlds overlap, details blur just enough to show their seams, and my glass reveals the seam as a silvered river along the altar. <words>165</words>
I am diligently whimsical in such moments, laying out marigolds by plumb line, measuring incense smoke with a carpenter's tape, laughing only inside. <words>188</words>
The curator asks what I am doing, and I tell her I am trying to kindrelize the boundary, to convince it we belong. <words>211</words>
To kindrelize is to make kin of estrangement, to braid the living and the buried without letting either be devoured by spectacle. <words>233</words>
The raucous silence deepens, a carnival with no barkers, and I hear drums only in the throb of my thumbs against the handle. <words>256</words>
Through the lens, a boy in feathered cotton tends a fire where my shovel stands, and his eyes meet mine across layered nights. <words>279</words>
He mouths a blessing I learned from my grandfather, the last grave singer in our town, and I nod to keep it alive. <words>302</words>
The curator's confession still hangs like a wet banner, and the hush around it lets me weigh whether intention can repair stolen stones. <words>325</words>
I start a low chant, not performance but practice, tracing salt in patient spirals so the dead and the tourists do not collide. <words>348</words>
The vintage magnifying glass becomes a modest sun, focusing thin light to ignite copal, and the boy across the seam mirrors the spark. <words>371</words>
Wind threads through the broken fence line again, a courier bearing consent, and my shovel loosens without force, as if the ground exhaled. <words>394</words>
The curator kneels, setting aside her brochure words, and asks how to help without theft, her voice smaller than dusty light through corn. <words>417</words>
Learn the chant, I say, learn to barter with silence, and together we kindrelize by cleaning names, returning fragments, and feeding the guardians. <words>440</words>
When the worlds overlap just right, the hush becomes a bridge, and our raucous silence holds, preserving practice without applause while the fire cools. <words>464</words></story>
