<story>I wash the dead because it is honest work in a dishonest family. [13]
The funeral home prep room smells like citrus, ethanol, and deathly vitality held too long in the mouth. [31]
On the steel table lies a man who is not dead, pretending expertly. [44]
He breathes in the thin pencil-lines between my movements, shallow as a written margin. [58]
Arman is his name, though tonight it must travel only inside our eyes. [71]
We are doing what my father did without lies, a miracle I measure carefully. [85]
He conned governors and midwives, selling miracles on credit and grief for cash. [98]
I want the inverse function, the mathematics of a fair trade that cancels debts cleanly. [113]
Help Arman reach political asylum, and something in this city stops overcharging the living. [127]
The director thinks Arman is a donor for a teaching hospital, which is almost true. [142]
His body is a lesson in risk, my hands a proof that risk can be art. [158]
We wait by waiting actively, attending to the room until the room answers back. [172]
The pumps cough, the vents sigh, and every sound is a calendar without numbers. [186]
Our plan depends on a breach that looks like routine and not like courage. [200]
At shift change, the alarm gets silenced to reset; that is the brief open gate. [215]
Arman's sponsors pressed papers into my hands, stamped in blue from another language. [228]
I keep them dry inside the cabinet, next to the vintage ink pot my father loved. [244]
Its glass is scarred by rings like the timeline of a small moon, stubborn and elegant. [260]
He used that ink to forge tenderness into contracts; I use it to sign witness. [275]
The blue inside sloshes as I move, liquefies rigid thinking in me with a sound. [290]
If I write, I must write the truth that will not cheat the truth to win. [306]
Arman's eyelids tremble when the door bell rings, but my hand never leaves his shoulder. [321]
I make motions with towels and tubing, theatre for the security camera that blinks politely. [336]
Waiting actively is like polishing a mirror; the reflection arrives because the cloth never stops. [351]
In the drawer is the ledger of transit, the names of those we passed through. [366]
I keep it in my cramped handwriting for court, for dignity, for counting the bargain. [381]
The mathematics must be visible to others, not only to my frightened wish for symmetry. [396]
When the director knocks and opens, I am rinsing instruments, singing low to no one. [411]
He peers, sniffs, signs a form with my fountain, and tells me not to overclean muscle. [427]
He leaves the bolt hanging; he always does, a habit that becomes our hinge of escape. [443]
This is the breach, shaped like inattention, exact and kind as a key. [456]
I drain the sink to mask the scrape when I slide Arman into the cart. [471]
His skin is cold with the gel I rubbed, but his fingers find my wrist and squeeze. [488]
I whisper the plan again: a roll, a sheet, the service elevator, the door that sulks. [504]
If we are stopped, I will not lie, but I will not name him dead. [519]
Fairness is a curve, not a curtain, and I keep us on its gentle side. [534]
We move down the hallway as the floor polisher drones its hymn, sanctifying our small procession. [550]
At the service door, the reset chime dings; the camera light goes dead and blinks again. [566]
In that rhythm is the window, and I push the dolly through air that tastes like coins. [583]
Outside, a van idles beneath the exhaust, white paint freckled with leaf acid and patience. [598]
I hand the sponsors the ledger to sign, and uncap the old ink so it breathes. [614]
The pen nib drinks from the vintage ink pot, swallowing night as if it were law. [630]
I sign that I saw, that I held, that he chose to live and to testify. [646]
The sponsors pass Arman the invisible passport of touch, code words threaded through the cloth. [661]
He climbs, and the van swallows him, and the air stays dead, then wakes a little. [677]
In return, they give me numbers, the account where officials laundered the bribes for silence. [692]
It is not money I want, but proportion; I need the proof that trades can balance. [708]
Political asylum requires evidence of danger, and now their breach is recorded in their own ink. [724]
I will carry it to the clinic attorney, who speaks bureaucracy the way I wash bodies. [740]
Inside the room, the table is still warm where Arman lay, and I clean the warmth away. [757]
The ink pot sits back in the cabinet, a little moon with tides that answer to hands. [774]
I think of my father and his carnival math, and feel the new vowel of fairness arrive. [791]</story>
