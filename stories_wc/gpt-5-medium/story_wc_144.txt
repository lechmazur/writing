<story>Mist beads the air of the mist-coated rail depot, where a narrow repair shop glows like a lantern in gauze. [20]
Inside, a heartfelt artisan turns her face toward the door as if toward sun, though the room is dim. [39]
She is a heartfelt artisan who oversees while blind, and she listens for the metal steps like notes. [57]
On her bench waits an artificial hummingbird drone, its wings folded, its speaker silent, its memory holding scraps of sky. [77]
Outside, harbor bells stutter as an anchor lifts for a ship's maiden voyage, timbers groaning like a great throat clearing. [97]
The depot watches with windows, and the shop returns the gaze with circuits, brushes, and bowls of water. [115]
She keeps bowls everywhere, for examining light refraction through water features has become her compass and chronometer. [132]
Assistants hold mirrors to the bowls so sunlight flickers through mist into ripples that hum against her fingertips. [150]
From those vibrations she reads angles, and from angles she reads direction, and from direction she reads intent. [168]
Today, the intent belongs to the hummingbird, which has to decode feedback into direction before the maiden freight can couple. [188]
Fog scrambles landmarks, and rails and ropes wear the same color of wet, so the drone must guide by tone and shimmer. [210]
She threads a patch of copper braid across a fried trace, whispers to the board, and feels the circuit answer. [230]
The patch is not just repair but vow, a closing of distance between wandering signal and the work of hands. [250]
Her apprentice, Mirel, dampens the room to hush the dust, and sets the water bowls near the open threshold. [269]
Near the tracks, porters shout, and the anchor chain keeps climbing, rattling the morning like beads slid along a string. [289]
The artisan tilts her head, measuring the chain's metal vowels, and the drone perks as if to sip the sound. [309]
She slides the drone onto her wrist, and its tiny feet clasp the leather like a bird claiming a twig. [329]
Mirel opens the side door, letting in the world, and the bowls tremble with answers she has already learned to translate. [350]
The artisan breathes magnetic calm, and the depot seems to breathe with her, old iron easing into a patient posture. [370]
She says to the drone, You will hear them and answer, and in your answer they will find the way. [390]
Mirel nods, examining light refraction through water features as clouds search the sun, sight becoming a shared ritual of reading. [410]
They map the dancing lines to numbers, and the numbers hum through a speaker that taps the artisan's wrist in Morse. [431]
This is how she oversees while blind, turning feedback to beat, beat to length, length to a quiet geometry of routes. [452]
When the first coupling car coasts in, the air presses, and the shop's floor hums, and the drone stirs to life. [473]
She lifts her wrist, and the drone leaps, stitching mist with silver arcs, listening to wheel-chatter, answering with single-note pips like pebbles. [495]
Each pip returns from water and wall, and Mirel traces the reflections, funneling coordinates back as thumbs on the artisan's palm. [516]
To decode feedback into direction, the artisan counts the taps against the anchor's clatter, against the porters' calls, against the steady breath of steam. [540]
She rotates in place, hearing the drone's return slow, then quicken, and she points, and Mirel signals the crew to ease right. [562]
Metal kisses metal without scream, a soft alignment, and the depot exhales as though the rails themselves had unclenched a fist. [583]
But then the fog folds thicker, swallowing a lantern, and the second car slants a fraction, an unkind whisper against geometry. [604]
The drone hesitates, the water's face muddied by wind, and the numbers stumble, and for a blink their ritual goes silent. [625]
She hears the change like a crack in chalk and calls for more bowls, more mirrors, more hands, not panic but precision. [647]
Mirel slides a basin beneath the eave where droplets fall, and the artisan touches the rain's drumhead and feels new coordinates bloom. [669]
She patches the code midair with taps, shortening a buffer, widening a window, and the drone accepts the patch like a second breath. [692]
Again the pips go out, thread the fog, bend around the hulls, and come back strung like beads across the bowls. [713]
She points left, then lifts two fingers, then three, counting beats to doors opening, brakes feathering, a choreography smoother than sight. [734]
The second car settles; the port cheer spreads; the ship's horn tests its throat; the anchor lifts clean; the maiden voyage begins. [756]
In the shop's doorway the artisan lowers her wrist, and the hummingbird lands, warm with work, as if flush with nectar. [777]
She smiles toward the harbor, her face a bright coin, and the depot returns the smile in the language of settled wheels. [799]</story>
