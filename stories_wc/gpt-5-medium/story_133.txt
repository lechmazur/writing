I was a jaded locksmith before the orchard taught me patience. <words>11</words>
A labyrinth orchard on the rooftops of a colonial town hummed like a hive set to prayers. <words>28</words>
I attended the rooftop pottery class for the kiln heat, not the company, and found both pleasantly exacting. <words>46</words>
During painting, a woman in embroidered gloves sat across from me and angled the bowl like a compass. <words>64</words>
Her smile was delightfully menacing, a frost traced in sugar. <words>74</words>
She said the town had an unclaimed throne, and the orchard kept the map to reach it. <words>91</words>
I told her thrones collect dust, while locks collect stories. <words>101</words>
She nodded, then let a drop of cobalt permeate a hairline crack in her clay, drawing veins like rivers on a flank. <words>123</words>
That river, she said, was a path for hunters shaped by trees and roofs and a dozen winds. <words>141</words>
Their methods were fading, and she needed a locksmith to lock the wrong doors and leave the right ones ajar. <words>161</words>
Demure audacity suits me, so I agreed before the glaze dried. <words>172</words>
She called herself Lirio and painted a kestrel whose eye watched the angle of every brush I raised. <words>190</words>
In the orchard, hunting was study, and study was how our town once chose its ruler. <words>206</words>
Now the throne waited unclaimed, and the paths forgot their feet. <words>217</words>
We carried our bowls through alleys of quince and chimney shadows, following a scent of sap and lye. <words>235</words>
Lirio whispered the old hunting methods as if they were lullabies for awake minds. <words>249</words>
Listen for roof tiles clicking under pigeons, watch the figs tilt toward footsteps, lock what panics, open what remembers. <words>268</words>
At a citrine arch of intertwined branches, I set my iron keys among the leaves and felt my cynicism loosen. <words>288</words>
Locks, I realized, were not only barriers but rhythms for learning where to go next. <words>303</words>
We reached a terrace where the orchard opened into a clearing of chimneys, and a stone chair waited under a net of vines. <words>326</words>
I would not sit, and neither would Lirio, because a throne untested stays untrue. <words>340</words>
Instead, we painted our bowls with the new map, then hid the chair behind locked routes and unlocked rituals, so the hunt could outlive us with delightfully menacing grace. <words>369</words>
It began as an encounter at a pottery class, yet it became a pact to preserve hunting methods without crowning anyone. <words>390</words>
The orchard would choose by listening, and roofs would bear witness, and the town would learn to track itself again. <words>410</words>
I slipped my jadedness like a spent glove, and her embroidered gloves never smudged as she plotted a future no throne could hold. <words>433</words>
Some nights, the kiln breath rises to permeate the labyrinth, and I walk the roofs, locking and unlocking by the kestrel's stare. <words>455</words>
The chair still waits, delightfully menacing, but so do we, demure in audacity, patient as fruit setting seed. <words>473</words>
