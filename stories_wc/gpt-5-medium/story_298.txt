<story>
After the last drop of oil was extracted, the city rebuilt the ancient Chinese palace as a reimagined theater and refuge. <words>21</words>
I arrived there, a chameleon stage actor with rationally impulsive habits, hunting roles the way drought birds hunt last puddles. <words>41</words>
My motive was simple and impossible: to weave emotional honesty into illusions until crowds mistook the truth for carefully tended lies. <words>62</words>
Licenses to reproduce were scarce, awarded only to citizens who redeemed history by solving cold-case mysteries that still festered beneath collapsed archives. <words>84</words>
If I could unmask the buried grief of the palace, a future family might be allowed to grow from my odd, color-shifting blood. <words>107</words>
Each morning, sunlight fell through debris punched in the roof, casting latticed scars that marked the stage like a celestial crime scene. <words>129</words>
Behind a cracked screen, I found a tattered doll's dress pinned to bamboo with hair needles, its hem stiff with ancient resin. <words>151</words>
The cold case named the Dew-Sleeve Heir, a child performer who vanished during the final imperial masquerade when whispers became warrants. <words>172</words>
I rehearsed every character who might have seen her, skin tones shifting, breath patterns borrowed, my voice reproducing timbres the way paper remembers folds. <words>196</words>
By night I staged scenes for the surviving ushers, coaxing their memories to speak back by solving cold-case mysteries in plain theatrical daylight. <words>219</words>
Anxious serenity hummed in the palace, like tea stilling after an earthquake. <words>231</words>
One noon, sunlight through debris illuminated the doll dress, revealing a stitched pattern that matched the lantern map of imperial escape tunnels. <words>253</words>
Rationally impulsive, I stopped the matinee and crawled into the dust-veined shaft behind the orchestra pit, measuring risk like a careful gambler. <words>275</words>
The tunnel unfurled beneath the palace lake, and shards in the ceiling let thin sunlight knives fall through debris, counting my breaths. <words>297</words>
There, a chamber opened where actors once hid their unpermitted children, and the tattered dress hung as a passport no guard would search. <words>320</words>
A faded mural showed the Dew-Sleeve Heir escaping with a troupe disguised as mourners, while a eunuch with a broken thumb blessed the ruse. <words>344</words>
Bones lay beneath the mural, the thumb crooked, and in the resin-smeared hem I found a strand of hair bound with palace silk. <words>367</words>
I returned to the stage and performed the truth, reproducing the procession step by step until the surviving archivist recognized the eunuch's limp. <words>390</words>
The council marked the cold case closed; a license to reproduce shook in my hands like a bird that wanted both sky and nest. <words>414</words>
Yet I did not celebrate so much as breathe, because my method had woven emotional honesty into illusions until illusion became a sheltering truth. <words>438</words>
On closing night, sunlight through debris gilded the lake, and we chameleon actors bowed as caretakers, serene and anxious in equal measure. <words>460</words>
If a child comes, I will teach them to shift with kindness and keep the palace open, so truth can keep reproducing refuge. <words>483</words>
