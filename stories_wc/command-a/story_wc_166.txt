In the twilight garden under stars, where shadows stretched like whispers across the dewy petals, a figure stood motionless, their feet bare and rooted in the earth as if spontaneously anchored to the soil. [37] This was Lira, a skilled tide dancer whose gift had once carried her across oceans, yet now she remained still, her gaze fixed on the horizon where the last hues of sunset bled into the night. [73] After the nostalgia ban, enacted by the Council of Eclipses to sever humanity’s connection to its past, Lira had chosen elective exile, retreating to this garden where time seemed to bend and break. [128] Her motivation was singular: to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin, a testament to what had been lost, etched in ink derived from the rare moonstone cabochon dust speck she carried in a vial around her neck. [187] The dust, when mixed with starlight, was said to capture the essence of forgotten memories, though its use was forbidden under the ban. [228] Lira’s hands trembled as she uncorked the vial, the speck glowing faintly, a miniature galaxy suspended in glass. [262] She knew the risk—discovery meant erasure, not just of her work, but of her very existence. [294] Yet the urge to fledge, to take flight from the confines of silence, was irrepressible. [318] Her method was unconventional: by observing gaps, the spaces between leaves, the pauses in the wind’s song, she found the rhythm of the cosmos. [364] It was in these voids that the truth of the universe revealed itself, unburdened by the weight of nostalgia. [399] The garden, with its obsidian grace, seemed to conspire with her, its flowers blooming in shades of midnight and silver, their petals unfurling like pages of a forgotten book. [450] Lira closed her eyes, letting the cool night air wash over her, and began to move, her body a conduit for the tide’s memory, though the ocean was leagues away. [499] Each step was deliberate, a dance not of water but of starlight, her feet tracing constellations on the earth. [535] As she spun, the moonstone dust speck floated from the vial, caught in a gust of wind, and settled on her palm, its glow intensifying with every heartbeat. [583] She dipped a quill into the dust, now mixed with dew, and pressed it to her forearm, the ink seeping into her skin like a secret whispered by the stars. [632] The first line of her verse appeared: *“In the gaps, we find what we’ve lost.”* [658] The words pulsed with a life of their own, each letter a tiny galaxy, each curve a wave frozen in time. [692] But as she wrote, the air grew heavy, the garden’s tranquility shattered by the sound of approaching footsteps. [727] Lira’s hand stilled, the quill hovering over her skin, the unfinished verse a promise and a threat. [759] She knew she could not flee—her exile was not just from society, but from fear itself. [791] Instead, she stood taller, her spine straight, her eyes open, ready to face whatever came next, her verse a shield and a sword. [836] The footsteps halted at the garden’s edge, and a figure emerged, cloaked in the same obsidian grace as the night. [872] It was a sentinel of the Council, their face obscured by a helmet of polished moonstone, their presence a silent judgment. [911] Lira did not bow, did not plead, but held out her arm, the verse glowing under the stars, a defiance etched in starlight and dust. [957] The sentinel paused, their hand hovering over their weapon, as if the verse itself had anchored them to the spot. [994] In that moment, Lira understood: the cosmic verse was not just hers to pen, but hers to protect, a beacon in the darkness of the nostalgia ban. [1043] And as the sentinel turned and walked away, the garden seemed to exhale, its flowers blooming brighter, their petals whispering a single word: *fledge.* [1092]
