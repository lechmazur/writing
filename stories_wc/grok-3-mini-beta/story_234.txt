<story>
In the shadowy dinosaur skeleton museum at night, when the orchard dog finally stopped barking, the gentle swordsman named Elaris wandered alone among the ancient bones, his blade sheathed but ever ready. <words>28</words>
Elaris was a late bloomer, a man who had only recently discovered his true calling after years of wandering foreign lands as a xenophile, drawn to the exotic customs and hidden wonders of distant cultures. <words>56</words>
His attribute of being faithfully unfaithful meant he always returned to his roots, yet with a restless heart that craved new horizons, a trait that had both isolated and enriched him. <words>84</words>
Tonight, his motivation—to cradle the universe in a cupped hand—drove him to the half-painted sundial in the museum's forgotten corner, its coded angles whispering secrets of cosmic alignment. <words>111</words>
He held an empty matchbox, a relic from his travels, its stark emptiness symbolizing the void he sought to fill with understanding. <words>134</words>
With brusque affection, Elaris traced the sundial's uneven lines, his fingers rough but careful, decoding the angles that pointed to a hidden compartment beneath a tyrannosaurus rex skeleton. <words>161</words>
"Damn fool quest," he muttered to himself, the words laced with the gruff warmth of self-mockery, as if scolding a dear friend. <words>184</words>
Inside the compartment, he found a star map etched on bone, a late bloomer's revelation that the universe wasn't vast and untouchable, but something one could grasp in fleeting moments. <words>211</words>
Elaris's eyes softened as he placed the empty matchbox over the map, imagining it as a vessel for the stars, his xenophile spirit finally at peace. <words>236</words>
Years of faithfully unfaithful journeys had led here, to this quiet epiphany in the museum's gloom, where the late bloomers of the world—forgotten relics and wandering souls—found their spark. <words>262</words>
He chuckled roughly, a sound like a blade being sheathed, and whispered, "You're not so bad, old man," addressing his reflection in the sundial's faded paint. <words>288</words>
As dawn crept in, Elaris cradled the matchbox in his palm, feeling the weight of infinite possibilities, his gentle nature blooming at last. <words>310</words>
The dinosaur bones seemed to watch him, silent witnesses to his transformation, their ancient forms echoing the late bloomers who outlasted time. <words>334</words>
In that brusque affection for the world, Elaris realized his unfaithfulness was merely a path to deeper loyalty, to the universe he now held, however briefly. <words>359</words>
He stepped out into the night, the orchard dog's distant bark a fading memory, his sword lighter, his heart full. <words>380</words>
And so, the gentle swordsman walked on, a late bloomer no more. <words>390</words>
