Elias, analytically unpredictable in his logical yet erratic ways, felt the edge of curiosity gnawing at him, urging him to break free from the hardened shell that years of nomadic life had built around his once-playful spirit. <words>56</words>

One evening, as the caravan paused by a moonlit meadow, Elias spotted a small spool of thread tangled in the grass, its thin line shimmering like a forgotten promise under the stars. <words>110</words>
