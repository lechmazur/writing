Jax, who once navigated pixels across screens, now traced the cracks in the observatory's cold stone floor. <words>18</words> This medieval fantasy realm had swallowed him whole after his drone punched through a reality he didn't know existed. <words>36</words> Outside, the air hung thick with the hush before the orchard’s trees were cut down, a silence mirroring the one in his chest. <words>57</words> He clutched the brittle, dried herb bundle, its faint, earthy scent a stark contrast to the ozone tang of his arrival. <words>77</words> It felt absurdly significant now, this strange keepsake from an encounter at a speed dating event back home. <words>96</words> He remembered her wry smile, the way she’d pressed it into his hand, calling it ‘a hedge against lonely horizons’. <words>117</words> Lonely horizons were all he had now, stretching vast and indifferent from the cliff edge outside the abandoned observatory's broken dome. <words>139</words> A cynically hopeful part of him, the part not entirely scorched by the crash and the impossibility of it all, clung to the memory. <words>164</words> Perhaps she’d meant horizons of mercy, a concept that felt alien yet desperately needed in this world of sharp steel and sharper glares. <words>189</words> His drone was scrap, his tech useless, leaving only wit and a dwindling supply of protein bars. <words>207</words> Despair gnawed constantly, a hungry beast pacing at the edge of his thoughts. <words>221</words> His only real motivation was to lure possibility from the brink of despair, to somehow twist fate before it snapped shut. <words>243</words> He needed to do *something*, anything more than just wait for starvation or discovery. <words>259</words> Looking at the herb bundle, an idea sparked, fragile but persistent. <words>272</words> What if these weren't just Earth herbs anymore? <words>281</words> What if, in this place, they held a different potential? <words>293</words> He decided he would disseminate their seeds from the highest point of the observatory. <words>310</words> It was a long shot, maybe a fool's errand fueled by desperation and half-remembered folklore from games he used to play. <words>333</words> But inaction felt like a slower death. <words>341</words> He climbed the crumbling stairs, the wind whistling through gaps in the masonry, carrying the scent of pine and damp earth and the faintest hint of woodsmoke from the valley below. <words>373</words> Reaching the exposed summit, Jax felt a strange calm settle over him, a charred serenity born from accepting the utter strangeness of his life. <words>399</words> He opened his hand, letting the wind catch the tiny seeds and dust from the dried herb bundle. <words>419</words> He watched them scatter, tiny specks against the bruised twilight sky, hoping they might find fertile ground, hoping they might signal something or someone across those unforgiving horizons. <words>451</words> It was a prayer offered to the void, a cynically hopeful attempt to seed mercy in a merciless land. <words>472</words> Below, the orchard waited silently for the axes. <words>481</words>
