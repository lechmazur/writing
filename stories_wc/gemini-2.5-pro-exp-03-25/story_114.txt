Kaelen, summoner by trade and apathetic by nature, regarded the shared dream recording studio with profound indifference. <words>18</words> The air still tasted faintly of ozone and sorrow, the lingering psychic residue from after the last breath of a dying god. <words>39</words> They were meant to be archiving dream fragments, but Kaelen practiced an enthusiastically lazy approach, achieving peak stillness with remarkable dedication. <words>62</words> Beside them, a rustic coffee grinder sat on a console flickering with dormant energy, its wooden handle worn smooth. <words>82</words> Kaelen occasionally used it to grind calcified memories into dust fine enough to ignore. <words>97</words>

Their current project, however, demanded a sliver more effort, a fact Kaelen resented with quiet intensity. <words>115</words> The motivation wasn't glory or power, but the absurdly specific task to rebuild coral reefs in the waking world. <words>136</words> Why reefs, Kaelen didn't know or particularly care; it was simply the directive echoing in the silence the god left behind. <words>159</words> It required accessing a particular strain of knowledge, something the remnants called river wisdom, the understanding of flow and resilience. <words>181</words>

Access was, inconveniently, located down a deserted hall branching off the main studio archive. <words>198</words> Kaelen sighed, a soft puff of air in the quiet hum, and drifted towards it, expending the absolute minimum energy required for locomotion. <words>224</words> The method was tedious: through matching empty frames hanging in a deserted hall, aligning their resonant frequencies within the dream-stream. <words>248</words> Each frame pulsed with faint, forgotten dream-light. <words>256</words> Kaelen paused before the first pair, eyes half-lidded, comparing the subtle patterns of void within them. <words>276</words> It was like tuning static, a task requiring focus they preferred to reserve for optimizing nap angles. <words>295</words>

With a flick of their wrist, almost too casual, they nudged the first frame's psychic signature into alignment with its counterpart across the hall. <words>321</words> A low chime echoed, less sound than a vibration felt in the teeth. <words>335</words> They proceeded down the hall, matching frame after empty frame, their movements economical, precise, honed by years of dedicated sloth. <words>359</words> The gentle sharpness of their focus was reserved solely for the efficiency of the task, not its purpose. <words>379</words>

As the final pair clicked into harmony, the far end of the hall shimmered. <words>396</words> Reality, or the dream-studio's version of it, began to unfold. <words>408</words> Not with a dramatic tear, but like a slow, inevitable tide turning, revealing patterns of light that coalesced into flowing, liquid symbols. <words>432</words> This was the river wisdom, raw data streams on ecological restoration, shimmering with the resilience of life that persisted even after a god's demise. <words>459</words> Kaelen watched, unmoved, already calculating the least taxing way to transfer this information and get back to grinding irrelevant memories. <words>483</words> The reefs would have to rebuild themselves, mostly. <words>492</words>
