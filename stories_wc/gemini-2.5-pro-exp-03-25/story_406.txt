The witch's potion brewery smelled of burnt sugar and regret, steam curling from copper vats just as the first grey light touched the street outside. <words>26</words> Anya, a spy more coy than confident, clutched the vial tightly, its contents shimmering like captured twilight. <words>42</words> Somewhere nearby, a morning paper landed softly on an empty porch, marking the precise, quiet hour. <words>58</words> Her motivation burned hotter than any cauldron: to finally become a master of disguise, erasing the flaws that haunted her. <words>77</words> The old witch, Baba Yulia, watched with eyes that held a diabolically benevolent amusement, knowing the price of shortcuts. <words>97</words> "Ready to mend fences the hard way, little shadow?" she rasped, smoke leaking from her pipe. <words>113</words> Anya nodded, her gaze fixed on the memory of her last assignment â€“ the ambassador's ball, the near exposure. <words>132</words> It all came down to a single, treacherous loose button on her borrowed uniform jacket, a detail missed in her haste. <words>153</words> That button, catching the light as it dangled, had almost cost her everything. <words>167</words> Now, she would bypass that failure entirely. <words>175</words> Uncorking the vial, Anya drank the viscous liquid, the taste like ozone and forgotten clocks. <words>191</words> The brewery dissolved around her, colours bleeding backwards, sounds spooling in reverse. <words>204</words> She felt herself pulled taut, then flung back through reversed time, the world rushing past in a dizzying rewind. <words>224</words> The ballroom reappeared, music playing backwards, dancers jerking unnaturally. <words>234</words> Anya saw her past self, mingling, blissfully unaware of the dangling thread. <words>247</words> The potion granted her a fleeting, ghostly presence within her own past. <words>260</words> She focused, reaching out with incorporeal fingers towards the offending loose button just moments before it snagged attention. <words>280</words> With a surge of will, she nudged the thread, tightening it, securing the button firmly back against the fabric. <words>300</words> The moment passed, the near-disaster averted in the reversed flow. <words>311</words> Then, time snapped forward violently, depositing her back onto the cold flagstones of the brewery. <words>327</words> Baba Yulia chuckled, a dry, rattling sound. <words>335</words> "The fence is mended," the witch declared, tapping out her pipe. <words>347</words> Anya touched her own chest, feeling phantom fabric, the ghost of the secure button. <words>362</words> She had succeeded, bypassed the error, preserved her cover story. <words>373</words> Yet, the triumph felt hollow, fragile, a distinct sensation of borrowed valor clinging to her like the potion's aftertaste. <words>393</words> True mastery remained elusive, bought with magic instead of earned through skill. <words>406</words> She offered the witch a hesitant smile, the coy spy acutely aware her greatest disguise was the confidence she didn't truly possess. <words>429</words> The path to becoming a master was longer, she now knew, than a trip through time. <words>446</words>
