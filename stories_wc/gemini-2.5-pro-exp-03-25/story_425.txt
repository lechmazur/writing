Sir Kaelen, last of the Solar Wardens, stood within the Grand Orrery Hall of the Kepler Terminus Observatory, a place built long after the last star was named and catalogued. <words>29</words> He was a paladin whose faith had curdled into duty, his expression perpetually morose. <words>42</words> The hall itself was lavishly austere, its vast dome depicting constellations now only accessible through archival data, the machinery silent beneath layers of dust. <words>69</words> Kaelen’s sole motivation was to restore these ancient systems, to hear the hum of forgotten celestial mechanics once more. <words>88</words> He felt a familiar blend of bored excitement, the tedious routine occasionally punctuated by minor breakthroughs. <words>104</words> Today, however, promised more than minor adjustments; the dormant flare detectors had begun a low, insistent thrumming against the silence. <words>126</words> Suddenly, the emergency lights flickered red, then died, plunging the observatory and the sprawling city visible through the reinforced plasglas below into absolute darkness – a city-wide blackout triggered by the predicted coronal mass ejection. <words>166</words> Moving by the faint residual glow of dormant consoles, Kaelen nearly stumbled over a figure huddled near the primary chronometer array. <words>189</words> It was a chance encounter he hadn't anticipated; a scavenger, judging by the ragged clothes and the satchel overflowing with stripped wiring. <words>213</words> "You shouldn't be here," Kaelen stated, his voice flat, devoid of surprise but edged with annoyance. <words>230</words> The scavenger scrambled, clutching something metallic, eyes wide in the oppressive dark. <words>242</words> Kaelen knew he had to confine the intruder; the delicate restoration sequence he planned during the flare’s energy surge couldn't risk interference. <words>267</words> A brief struggle ensued, clumsy in the blackness, ending with Kaelen pinning the smaller figure against a support column. <words>288</words> Rummaging quickly through the scavenger's dropped satchel for makeshift bindings, Kaelen’s fingers closed around a small, surprisingly heavy object: a dull sewing needle, likely looted from some hab-block ruin. <words>322</words> Useless for tying knots, he instead used its blunted point to jimmy open a nearby maintenance panel, intending to lock the scavenger inside the cramped space. <words>350</words> As he worked the primitive tool against the corroded lock mechanism, faint blue light began to pulse from the chronometer array behind him. <words>375</words> Visible changes spread across the control surfaces as the flare’s energy, channeled by Kaelen’s earlier adjustments, began coaxing the ancient systems back online. <words>400</words> Data streams flickered erratically on screens that hadn't shown life in centuries, bathing the hall in shifting patterns. <words>419</words> He shoved the protesting scavenger into the maintenance closet and secured the panel just as the main generator sputtered, adding its own weak light. <words>445</words> Kaelen turned back to the awakening machines, the dull needle still clutched in his hand, a faint, almost imperceptible upturn gracing the corner of his morose lips. <words>473</words> The restoration was beginning, born from darkness and disruption. <words>483</words>
