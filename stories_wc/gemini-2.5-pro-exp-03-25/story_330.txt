Sir Kaelen, a knight whose spirit mirrored his dented, lusterless armor, drifted aimlessly. <words>13</words> He was utterly dejected, a relic himself in this impossible place: a zero-gravity dance hall shimmering with silent music and ethereal dancers. <words>36</words> The entire scene pulsed with a sacred disorder, beautiful and baffling. <words>47</words> It was, for this strange pocket of reality, a normally abnormal state of affairs. <words>62</words> In his gauntleted hand, he clutched a single, cold trident prong, salvaged from a sunken realm whose name was now just sea-foam on the lips of legend. <words>91</words> He'd carried it for years, a heavy, useless memory. <words>100</words> Suddenly, the spectral image of an old watchtower clock hanging impossibly in the void chimed, striking an unexpected hour â€“ the thirteenth bell tolled not with sound, but with a tremor that resonated deep within Kaelen's bones. <words>141</words> That impossible chime acted as a catalyst, his perception shifting, his mental horizons deepening with sudden, startling clarity. <words>161</words> An ancient duty, long dormant, surged within him: the need to voice a silent vow echoing through ages, a promise made by his ancestors to powers forgotten by the surface world. <words>194</words> The trident prong warmed slightly, its intricate carvings seeming to shift in his grasp. <words>209</words> Purpose flared in his chest, a stark contrast to the despair that had clung to him like a shroud. <words>229</words> He had to act, to quicken his movements in this place where conventional speed had no meaning. <words>248</words> Kaelen pushed off from a slowly rotating chandelier made of captured starlight, angling himself away from the oblivious, waltzing figures. <words>270</words> His goal wasn't the grand entrance but a hidden exit, accessible only through forgotten paths. <words>286</words> These paths weren't tunnels or doors, but specific, intricate sequences of navigation through the null-gravity field, a kinetic language lost to most. <words>312</words> Guided by the prong's subtle vibration and the lingering resonance of the thirteenth chime, he initiated the first complex maneuver, a slow spin followed by a precise vector change. <words>344</words> The hall's normally abnormal physics now felt like a deliberate, sacred geometry, hiding its secrets in plain sight. <words>363</words> He moved through unseen currents, tracing the forgotten path with his entire body, the armor groaning softly. <words>382</words> Ahead, where only empty space and swirling nebulae-light had been moments before, a shimmering distortion appeared, an archway woven from the hall's chaotic energy. <words>409</words> This was the way, opened only by the impossible hour and the knowledge of the path. <words>428</words> Holding the trident prong from the sunken realm before him like a key and a weapon, Kaelen faced the portal. <words>450</words> His vow thrummed within him, ready to break its long silence. <words>461</words> He propelled himself forward, leaving the sacred disorder of the dance hall for the unknown promise of his deepening horizons. <words>482</words>
