Kael, knuckles raw and stained with luminescent spore-dust, surveyed the cavernous interior of the giant mushroom house. <words>18</words> The air hung thick and sweet, shimmering with a blurry vividness that made the glowing fungal walls seem to breathe. <words>36</words> Outside, the slow, final rotation of the forgotten windmill marked timeâ€™s decay, each creak echoing through the damp, living structure. <words>56</words> He was an edgy tradesman, specializing in the salvage of fractured moments, a grim profession for a dying world. <words>74</words> "It'll all fade anyway," he muttered, the thought comfortingly pessimistic, a familiar anchor in the swirling uncertainty. <words>91</words> His motivation wasn't hope, but the stark duty to carry a flickering candle through an endless void, a pinprick of defiance against the dark. <words>116</words> On the workbench fashioned from hardened mycelium lay the object of his current labor: a torn corner of a flyer, its faded ink hinting at a festival or a warning long past. <words>147</words> Memory, Kael knew, was never pure; it warped like heat haze, the core concept underpinning his entire existence, the distortion of memory his constant adversary and medium. <words>177</words> This fragment, barely tangible, represented a past he couldn't grasp but felt compelled to preserve in some form before the windmill groaned its last. <words>204</words> His task was precise: to vectorize the fragment's remaining data, translating the ghost of ink and paper into stable, geometric lines. <words>228</words> The method was esoteric, learned from whispers in crumbling archives: via synchronized watches. <words>243</words> Two timepieces, salvaged and recalibrated, lay beside the flyer, their faces displaying identical, rapidly cycling glyphs instead of numbers. <words>265</words> He strapped one to his wrist, its cold metal a stark contrast to the yielding fungal surfaces. <words>282</words> The other he carefully placed atop the torn corner, aligning its central axis with a faded crease. <words>301</words> As the windmill outside gave a particularly tortured groan, nearing its zenith, Kael initiated the sequence. <words>319</words> The watches hummed, emitting a low-frequency pulse that resonated through the mushroom's cap, causing the air's shimmering particles to dance faster. <words>343</words> Lines of faint light began projecting from the second watch, tracing the flyer's edges, attempting to capture the memory's decaying structure before it dissolved entirely. <words>370</words> It was a desperate act against entropy, translating the subjective blur into objective vectors, a map of a ghost. <words>391</words> The pessimism was comforting because it was honest; failure was likely, yet the attempt itself was the candle flame. <words>413</words> With a final, shuddering sigh that vibrated through the very floor, the windmill stopped. <words>428</words> Silence descended, broken only by the faint, steady hum of the watches and the almost imperceptible drip of condensation. <words>449</words> Kael stared at the faint vector projection hovering above the flyer, a fragile victory, another moment held against the void, his grim work momentarily complete. <words>477</words>
