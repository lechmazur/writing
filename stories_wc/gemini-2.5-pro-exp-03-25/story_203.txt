Elara’s workbench floated, bolted precariously to a panel salvaged from a defunct satellite, part of the sprawling, chaotic habitat woven from orbital debris. <words>24</words> Life up here was never usual, a constant improvisation against the void. <words>36</words> She meticulously clicked together the limbs of a brightly colored plastic dinosaur, the task a small anchor amid toy assembly that did little to calm the tremor in her hands. <words>64</words> Elara, an exorcist who dreaded an audience more than any spectral entity, felt the familiar knot tighten in her stomach. <words>84</words> Her family’s legacy wasn't just the strange sensitivity to the echoes clinging to salvaged tech, but an inheritance of lies whispered about controlling fear, lies she fought daily. <words>115</words> They’d told her strength was silence, suppression, but her power flared brightest when she acknowledged the terror, transforming it into a defiant hush. <words>142</words> Her motivation wasn't glory, but the quiet, desperate need to sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never” – the ‘never brave enough’, ‘never strong enough’ that haunted her lineage. <words>174</words> Tucked beside the half-finished toy was a small, vacuum-sealed frame containing pressed wildflowers, fragile blues and yellows from an Earth none aboard had ever touched. <words>201</words> They were her focus, a tangible piece of truth against the manufactured reality of the station and the deceptions passed down through generations. <words>227</words> These flowers, impossibly real, were proof that beauty could persist against all odds, a symbol she clung to during her work. <words>251</words> A sharp, metallic click echoed through the module – the sound of a key turning in a lock, activating the automated quarantine sequence for the adjacent chamber. <words>279</words> Her next client, or rather, the afflicted piece of equipment containing the parasitic echo, had arrived. <words>297</words> Stage fright coiled, cold and sharp, threatening to paralyze her. <words>308</words> Taking a deep, shuddering breath, Elara pushed the dinosaur aside, her knuckles white. <words>322</words> She picked up the frame of wildflowers, its smooth surface cool against her trembling fingers. <words>338</words> The ritual required her to submerge her consciousness, to carefully wade into the chaotic energy signature clinging to the object in the chamber. <words>363</words> It was a drowning, a controlled descent into psychic noise, guided only by her training and the fragile image of the flowers. <words>387</words> With the lock’s echo still vibrating in the metal walls, she closed her eyes, embracing the fear, letting the defiant hush settle over her as she began the delicate, terrifying work. <words>421</words> She would face the echo, face the lies, face the fear, and from that confrontation, wrestle possibility into existence, one trembling breath at a time, high above a forgotten world. <words>455</words> The wildflowers in her mind bloomed against the static. <words>464</words>
