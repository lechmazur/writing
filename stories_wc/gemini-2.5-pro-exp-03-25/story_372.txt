Kael, a spy whose heart ached more than his cybernetically enhanced knee, navigated the neon-slicked alleys of Neo-Veridian's lower sectors. <words>21</words> Rainwater mirrored the towering chrome ziggurats above, but the puddles showed unfamiliar reflections, twisting his own weary face into something monstrous, something lost. <words>46</words> He clutched an unused sticky label in his pocket, smooth and blank, meant for a package he’d never sent Anya. <words>66</words> It felt like a tiny anchor against the unstoppable avalanche of compromised data cascading towards his location, the digital ghost of his failed mission. <words>91</words> His superiors called it Protocol: Ragnarok; he just called it Tuesday. <words>103</words> He felt curiously indifferent to the klaxons beginning to wail in the distance, a strange calm settling over the panic. <words>124</words> This rambling destiny, always one step ahead of the reaper, one step behind happiness. <words>139</words> He ducked into a cramped noodle stall, the air thick with synthetic steam and desperation. <words>155</words> He remembered meeting Anya right here, years ago, bonding over a shared interest in urban exploration, mapping the forgotten underbelly of this gleaming, rotting city. <words>184</words> They’d charted derelict mag-lev tunnels and scaled abandoned broadcast towers, fueled by cheap synth-noodles and a reckless disregard for authority. <words>209</words> Anya used to gloat whenever she found a hidden route first, her laughter echoing brighter than any neon sign. <words>229</words> Now, only the echo remained, mocking his solitude. <words>238</words> The stall owner slid a bowl towards him – "New recipe," the vendor grunted, wiping grease on a stained apron. <words>259</words> Kael picked up the crude chopsticks, the scent unfamiliar yet strangely compelling. <words>272</words> He needed to keep moving, to outrun the avalanche that was surely only minutes away, but the memory of Anya, sharp and sudden, held him fast. <words>301</words> Was this indifference a shield, or had he truly lost the will to run? <words>316</words> He saw another reflection, not in water, but in the polished surface of his spoon – a face hardened, older, yet with a flicker of the man who’d climbed rooftops with her. <words>349</words> He brought the noodles to his lips, the complex, spicy-sweet flavour exploding on his tongue at the instant the stall's shutters slammed down, plunging the alley into near darkness. <words>381</words> The avalanche had arrived, heralded not by sirens now, but by heavy, booted footsteps approaching rapidly. <words>398</words> Kael allowed himself a small, internal gloat; they thought they had him trapped, but Anya had shown him a way out of this very dead-end alley years ago. <words>430</words> He dropped credits on the counter, the unused sticky label falling unnoticed beside them as he slipped through a loose ventilation grate Anya had marked, vanishing back into the city's forgotten veins. <words>466</words> His destiny rambled on, indifferent to capture, forever chasing a ghost through the ruins of tomorrow, fueled by spice and sorrow. <words>490</words>
