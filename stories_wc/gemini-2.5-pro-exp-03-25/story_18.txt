Galen, the living statue, stood perpetually in the steam-powered city square, his bronze skin slick with condensation. <words>18</words> He passively received the cacophony of thoughts, a constant barrage in his quest to find truth in a world of lies. <words>38</words> The air hung thick with coal smoke and forced optimism, a gloomy cheerfulness that permeated everything. <words>54</words> For weeks, he'd focused his telepathy on the city council's discussions, observing their minds throughout planning the upcoming 'Prosperity Gala'. <words>77</words> Lies layered upon half-truths, budgets skimmed, promises made hollow even in thought. <words>92</words> His gaze often snagged on a young scribe, frantically taking notes, her hair held back by a threadbare hair tie, its elastic fraying like the city's integrity. <words>123</words> She seemed earnest, yet her thoughts were a whirlwind of confusion and dictated falsehoods she was forced to record. <words>143</words> Today, during a heated debate about diverting funds meant for orphanage repairs, the scribe paused, her pen hovering. <words>165</words> Galen pushed his focus into her mind, past the dictated lies, searching. <words>179</words> Suddenly, amidst the internal chaos, a flicker: a memory of her own childhood hunger, a sharp, pure understanding of the council's cruelty. <words>204</words> It was the light of recognition, stark and painful, illuminating the truth she was complicit in hiding. <words>224</words> A single, silent tear escaped her eye, unseen by the arguing officials, but felt keenly by Galen. <words>243</words> Witnessing her silent epiphany brought Galen a tragically joyful pang; truth found, but wrapped in sorrow and helplessness. <words>266</words> He felt an urge to weatherize himself against the corrosive cynicism threatening to overwhelm him after such insights. <words>286</words> Mentally, he began to trace patterns, ordering the chaotic influx of city thoughts with the flow of ink in calligraphy, each mental stroke a deliberate act of finding structure amidst the noise. <words>325</words> He pictured the elegant, controlled lines forming characters for 'truth', 'pain', 'hope'. <words>340</words> The steam hissed, gears ground, and the scribe resumed writing, her face a mask again, but her inner landscape irrevocably altered. <words>365</words> Galen remained, a bronze sentinel in the grimy square, his surface unchanging but his core resonating with that shared, silent moment. <words>389</words> The threadbare hair tie seemed a poignant symbol of the fragile, worn-down honesty he sought. <words>407</words> His vigil continued, forever seeking those sparks of recognition in the pervasive gloom, fueled by a grim, determined cheerfulness. <words>430</words> The planning for the gala would proceed, built on deceit, but one small truth had surfaced, and for Galen, that was a victory, however small, however sad. <words>461</words> He settled deeper into his stillness, a silent witness processing the world one thought, one tragically joyful recognition, at a time. <words>486</words>
