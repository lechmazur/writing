Elias Thorne, a meteorologist whose career was a monument to near misses and bad timing, felt the familiar pull toward the latest cosmic eventâ€”a meteor strike in the badlands. <words>27</words> His true obsession, however, wasn't the rock itself, but its potential influence on the region's unique subterranean flora; he desperately needed to study the plant behaviors altered by the impact's energy. <words>61</words> Impatient and seeking a quicker route to the projected impact crater, Elias ducked into a narrow, unmapped canyon, a shortcut whispered about by dubious prospectors. <words>89</words> The ground abruptly gave way beneath him, plunging him into darkness and then, astonishingly, onto the phosphorescent-lit thoroughfare of an underground city. <words>116</words> Reptilian figures with intelligent, obsidian eyes regarded him with unnerving calm from structures that seemed grown rather than built. <words>138</words> This hidden metropolis thrived in a state of systematic chaos, pathways shifting with geothermal currents, light sources dimming and flaring without apparent reason. <words>164</words> Elias fumbled for his grandfather's mariner's sextant, not for stars, but hoping to gauge the angles of the vast cavern ceiling, a desperate attempt to orient himself in this impossible place. <words>197</words> Before he could take a reading, a towering lizard guard, clad in what looked like woven basalt fibers, blocked his path. <words>221</words> "Your surface world seeks the sky-stone," the guard hissed, its voice raspy yet carrying a strange melodic quality, "while we guard the roots it disturbed." <words>249</words> Elias found himself trapped between colliding interests: his own scientific curiosity about the affected plants below, and the territorial imperative of these beings who saw the meteor not as a wonder, but an intrusion. <words>286</words> "I only wish to observe the flora," Elias stammered, trying to project harmlessness. <words>300</words> The guard tilted its head, a slow, deliberate movement. <words>309</words> "Observe," it echoed, the word dripping with a bitter honey tone, sweet with condescension yet sharp with warning. <words>329</words> "You stumble seeking petals and find only the deep truths spoken in shadows." <words>344</words> Elias felt an urge to argue, to defend his purpose, initiating a tense verbal spar about intentions and consequences. <words>364</words> "Truths?" Elias countered, his voice trembling slightly, "The truth is I took an unexpected encounter while taking a shortcut, nothing more." <words>386</words> "The truth," the guard replied, leaning closer, its unblinking eyes reflecting the dim light, "is that your 'nothing more' has placed you where choices are few and survival is not guaranteed." <words>421</words> The unlucky meteorologist realized his quest to study simple plant behaviors had led him into a complex, dangerous ecosystem far beyond botany, where spoken truths cut deeper than any rockfall. <words>454</words> He lowered the sextant, its brass suddenly feeling cold and useless against the weight of his predicament in the heart of the lizard people's domain. <words>482</words>
