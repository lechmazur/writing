Dust motes danced in the single beam of light slanting through the colossal pages that formed the walls of this forgotten library. <words>22</words> I, a parched desert ranger far from the sun-scorched dunes I knew, hunched over the flickering viewer. <words>39</words> My throat felt like sandpaper, a constant reminder of the world outside this impossible refuge nestled within a giant's book. <words>59</words> These entries, scrawled hastily during breaks, were my only anchor, chronicling the obsessive task that had consumed me: to map weather patterns no one else believed existed. <words>88</words> My method felt archaic, almost absurd here – comparing silent video footage from decades apart, salvaged from decaying reels stacked between towering, unreadable words. <words>116</words> Frame by painstaking frame, I nudged the brittle film forward using a bent paperclip, its warped metal cool against my cracked thumb. <words>140</words> It was the only tool delicate enough for the decaying projector mechanism, a relic itself. <words>156</words> What emerged wasn't sudden catastrophe, but the undeniable path of gradience, the slow, creeping transformation of fertile lands into the wasteland I called home. <words>184</words> Clouds that once gathered now hesitated, thinning year by year across the silent, flickering decades; rivers shown shrinking centimetre by painstaking centimetre. <words>210</words> An electric peace settled over me, the quiet hum of the viewer mingling with the profound silence of the giant tome, the thrill of understanding warring with the desolation it revealed. <words>243</words> Finding this place had been tactically reckless, ignoring the sand-mad warnings of the elders about forbidden knowledge buried by beings beyond comprehension. <words>269</words> They spoke of minds shattered by truths held within books scaled for titans, but the thirst for answers had outweighed the fear. <words>293</words> Now, juxtaposing a film from ninety years ago with one from twenty, the pattern wasn't merely decline; it was control, subtle manipulations of airflow, minute alterations in reflectivity invisible except across generations. <words>333</words> Someone, or something, had been patiently, methodically bleeding my world dry. <words>346</words> The gradience wasn't natural; it was engineered. <words>354</words> My diary entries shifted then, the hurried script reflecting not just observation but a dawning, terrible resolve. <words>373</words> All my previous theories, my acceptance of a dying world, my carefully constructed maps based on natural cycles – they were useless, built on a false premise. <words>400</words> With the cold certainty provided by the silent, moving images, I knew what must be done. <words>417</words> I had to raze my own understanding, tear down the entire edifice of my knowledge built on lies. <words>436</words> Only by destroying that internal landscape could I begin to see the real enemy, the real mechanism behind the stolen rain. <words>458</words> The paperclip dropped from my numb fingers, clattering softly on the page-floor as a stark, clear purpose settled within the electric peace. <words>483</words> My hunt had just begun. <words>489</words>
