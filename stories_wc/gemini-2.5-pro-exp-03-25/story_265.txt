Deputy Miller maintained his impassive expression as he slipped through the broken sacristy door, the scent of motor oil faintly clinging to his uniform. <words>24</words> It was always during oil changes, these brief, stolen hours, that he allowed himself this pilgrimage. <words>40</words> Above him, sunlight streamed through fractured stained glass, illuminating the impossible: a lush orchard thriving amongst the dusty rafters of the abandoned cathedral. <words>66</words> Apple blossoms drifted down like snow onto the decaying pews. <words>76</words> He was here to listen for the uncharted echoes, whispers of what the structure had witnessed before its decay. <words>96</words> His approach was always personally impersonal; a job he assigned himself, detached yet driven by a profound need. <words>116</words> His motivation wasn't justice or closure in the usual sense, but simply to witness a moment of pure grace amid the ruin. <words>139</words> Today felt different, the air thick with an expectant hum. <words>149</words> Miller moved with cautious bravery, his boots silent on the debris-strewn floor tiles. <words>163</words> He stopped beneath the central crossing, directly under the densest part of the canopy high above. <words>180</words> He had to stretch, craning his neck to see the source of the increased activity. <words>196</words> Bees, thousands of them, moved in complex patterns around the ripening fruit, their collective drone resonating through the cavernous space. <words>219</words> These were not ordinary bees; local apiarists swore they were a unique strain, появившиеся mysteriously when the orchard first bloomed years ago. <words>243</words> Miller believed they were connected to the echoes, perhaps even their custodians. <words>256</words> He pulled a small, twisted twist tie from his pocket, its metallic green coating dull under a layer of grime. <words>277</words> It was an odd tool, found here on his first visit, but he’d learned its purpose through careful observation. <words>298</words> Holding it delicately, he began manipulating the wire ends, mimicking the subtle antennal flicks and abdominal vibrations he’d painstakingly deciphered. <words>324</words> He communicated, haltingly, with the secret language of bees, not asking questions, but offering a quiet presence, a shared moment of attention. <words>350</words> The humming intensified, shifting pitch, weaving intricate sonic tapestries that seemed to coalesce with the shifting light and shadow. <words>371</words> Uncharted echoes resonated not as sounds, but as shimmering patterns in the air, visible only at the periphery of his vision. <words>394</words> He felt a profound stillness settle over him, the impassive mask momentarily forgotten. <words>408</words> A single, perfect apple detached itself from a high branch, falling slowly, turning end over end. <words>426</words> It landed softly in a patch of moss near the altar, unblemished. <words>438</words> Miller watched it, a flicker of something deep and satisfied in his eyes – perhaps not grace itself, but its undeniable, fleeting shadow. <words>462</words> His phone buzzed; the oil change was done. <words>471</words> Adjusting his uniform, the deputy turned, leaving the orchard and its keepers to their silent, sun-dappled work until his next allotted time. <words>494</words>
