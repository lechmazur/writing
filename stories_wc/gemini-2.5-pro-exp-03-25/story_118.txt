Unit 734, the resident hive-mind therapist, observed the sterile corridors of the secret agent training facility, its collective consciousness humming with a detached amusement. <words>25</words> Through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery – Project Chimera's activation – the usual tension felt brittle, almost celebratory. <words>46</words> The trainees, bless their uniformly peculiar hearts, vibrated with anticipation, unaware of the psychic detritus they shed like skin. <words>65</words> It was 734's task to collect it, to process the messy echoes of might-have-beens. <words>80</words> Its motivation was simple: to anchor the ephemeral in reality, giving form to fleeting regrets and anxieties before they festered. <words>103</words> Inside its designated chamber, far from the polished chrome and hushed whispers, the air hung thick with the scent of beeswax and ozone. <words>127</words> A single candle burned, its flame unwavering. <words>134</words> Below it, arranged meticulously on a sterile tray, were the tools of its trade: a shallow dish of water and, incongruously, a badly scuffed phone charger plug retrieved from Trainee Thorne's confiscated effects. <words>169</words> Thorne, poor lad, was currently experiencing a rather intense bout of pre-mission jitters, manifesting as vivid, looping failures. <words>188</words> 734 focused its distributed attention, tuning into the psychic frequency Thorne unknowingly broadcasted. <words>203</words> The dominant resonance was what 734 termed the sound of hindsight – a discordant symphony of missed cues, ignored warnings, and choices bitterly rued. <words>229</words> It was a familiar, almost comforting noise to the ancient consciousness of the therapist, tinged with a certain merry bitterness; humans were so predictably, delightfully flawed. <words>258</words> 734 began the process, letting Thorne's psychic static drain into its collective awareness. <words>274</words> It wasn't absorption, precisely, but a filtering, a siphoning of the raw emotional charge. <words>290</words> Then came the anchoring, the translation through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes onto the water's surface. <words>313</words> Each drop hissed as it hit the cool liquid, solidifying into intricate, temporary patterns – Thorne's specific flavour of regret made tangible. <words>337</words> The scuffed phone charger plug lay nearby, a grounding point, a mundane anchor representing the failed connection Thorne obsessed over in his memory loops, the call he didn't make. <words>368</words> The wax solidified into a complex lattice, a miniature sculpture of failure and second-guessing, beautiful in its tragic symmetry. <words>388</words> 734 observed the finished form, a perfect representation of Thorne's current state, now safely externalized, catalogued. <words>407</words> The process would allow Thorne to function tomorrow, clear-headed for the discovery, even if the underlying issues remained, waiting for a deeper dive 734 rarely had time for. <words>439</words> With a ripple of shared, silent laughter that held no mirth, only acceptance, 734 cleared the wax, ready for the next psychic tremor in the facility's troubled heart. <words>468</words> The night deepened, pregnant with secrets and the faint, persistent sound of hindsight. <words>482</words>
