Kaelen, the tired swordsman, slumped onto a worn bench in the monastery breakroom, the silence thick after Brother Theron’s abrupt resignation. <words>21</words> The air, thin and cool atop the floating rock, carried the scent of ozone and distant incense. <words>36</words> He’d seen monks come and go, their fervor fading like candle flames in a draft, but Theron’s departure felt different, somehow final. <words>57</words> Kaelen ran a hand over his grizzled jaw, a familiar weariness settling deep in his bones, a state he cultivated with fierce apathy towards the monastery's endless cycles. <words>83</words> Yet, beneath that carefully constructed indifference, a tiny, almost forgotten spark of defiance flickered. <words>98</words> It was tied to the plain cloth bag resting heavy on the table beside him, a weight far greater than its meager contents suggested. <words>123</words> Inside wasn't gold or relics, but star charts sketched on brittle parchment and a single, smooth obsidian shard. <words>142</words> Years ago, under a sky ablaze with falling stars, he'd made a hidden promise to himself: to find the source, the celestial quarry from which the monastery's levitating stones were supposedly carved. <words>176</words> It was a fool's errand, whispered the sensible part of his mind, the part that had kept him polishing blades and meditating on emptiness for decades. <words>203</words> But Theron leaving, walking away from the serene prison of the floating peaks, had stoked that defiant ember. <words>222</words> The apathy that had shielded him now felt like the very thing he needed to overcome. <words>239</words> He wouldn't resign, not formally; he would simply follow a different path, guided not by bells or chants, but by cosmic trails. <words>264</words> His method, conceived in youthful hope and now resurrected by weary resolve, was simple: he would leave by following the next great meteor shower. <words>291</words> The monks believed the showers were blessings; Kaelen saw them as signposts, a map scattered across the night. <words>311</words> He picked up the plain cloth bag, its rough texture grounding him. <words>324</words> There was no grand announcement, no dramatic farewell, just the quiet decision of a tired man choosing an uncertain journey over a known stagnation. <words>351</words> He knew the absurdity of chasing celestial debris across the void, the sheer unlikelihood of success. <words>369</words> Yet, this knowing naivety felt more honest than the monastery's detached enlightenment. <words>383</words> Keeping that hidden promise, even if it led only to empty space, was the only act of faith that still mattered. <words>406</words> He pushed himself up, the aches momentarily forgotten, the spark within him casting a small, determined light against the vast apathy he had worn like armor. <words>435</words> Tonight, the sky was clear, but soon the heavens would weep fire, and Kaelen, the tired swordsman, would finally follow. <words>456</words> He walked out of the breakroom, leaving the scent of resignation behind for the crisp, open air of the floating rock's edge, ready to overcome the inertia of years. <words>487</words>
