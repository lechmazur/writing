Elias adjusted the worn collar of his waistcoat, the familiar texture a stark contrast to the cold brass railing of the steampunk observation deck. <words>24</words> Below, the city sprawled, a labyrinth of whirring gears and venting steam, strangely silent now, after the last code is broken. <words>46</words> He was a tailor, once content stitching seams, but now gripped by a nostalgia for lives he hadn't lived, lives glimpsed in the fractured data the final sequence had unlocked. <words>77</words> His true motivation burned hotter than any furnace below: to ascend beyond mortal limits, to escape the confines of this single, flawed existence. <words>103</words> Rain began to lash against the ornate glass dome overhead, the burgeoning storm mirroring the hopeful desperation churning within him. <words>124</words> He turned towards the far corner, where a tall, dusty mirror leaned against a copper-riveted wall. <words>141</words> Its surface was clouded, reflecting his own gaunt face and the flickering gaslights with a subtly menacing distortion, hinting at infinite, imperfect copies. <words>168</words> This deck, perched at the pinnacle of their clockwork world, felt like the edge of everything, especially now. <words>188</words> The concept of parallel lives wasn't theoretical anymore; the broken code proved they shimmered just beyond perception, alternate Elias’s who made different choices, suffered different regrets. <words>221</words> Thunder cracked, rattling the very structure around him. <words>230</words> Elias gripped the railing, knuckles white, and began the ritual that calmed him, the method he’d stumbled upon: via improbable confessions during storms. <words>258</words> "In one," he whispered, his voice nearly lost to the wind and rain, "I never left the shop; I married Elara." <words>280</words> He paused, watching his hazy reflection. <words>287</words> "She didn't die in the Great Steam Incident there." <words>298</words> It was an impossible memory, yet it felt real, a borrowed ache. <words>311</words> He needed to reassure himself that this path, this terrifying ascent, was the correct one, the only way to perhaps find a reality where loss hadn't defined him, or to transcend loss entirely. <words>349</words> "Another me deciphered the penultimate code, not the last," he confessed to the swirling dust motes dancing before the mirror, "He grew cautious, afraid." <words>378</words> Elias scoffed, a harsh, brittle sound. <words>385</words> "He stayed grounded, forever wondering." <words>391</words> Not him; he had broken the final barrier, seen the pathways. <words>403</words> The storm raged, the observation deck groaning, the air thick with ozone and the scent of hot metal. <words>421</words> He looked into the dusty mirror again, seeking not his reflection, but the promise beyond it. <words>439</words> With trembling hope and stark terror warring in his eyes, the nostalgic tailor prepared to stitch himself into the fabric of infinity. <words>463</words> The ascent awaited. <words>467</words>
