Mei, assassin by trade and temperamentally unflappable, knelt beside the lacquered table in the unnervingly silent chamber of the ancient chinese palace. <words>24</words> Her deadline was ridiculously abstract yet absolute: before the first question is asked. <words>37</words> Whose question, about what, the prophecy hadn't specified, which Mei found both irritating and faintly amusing, contributing to the humorous unease that permeated the perfumed air. <words>66</words> Her current task felt less like assassination and more like aggressive horticulture. <words>78</words> Before her sat an ornate botanical press, its brass screws gleaming faintly in the light filtering through the silk screens. <words>99</words> Inside, she carefully arranged petals of the Ghost Orchid and leaves of the Moonpetal Fern, attempting to spin a prophecy into raw possibility. <words>123</words> The prophecy spoke of the Emperor's favoured concubine birthing a shadow that would devour the sun, a prediction Mei considered dramatically overwrought but politically inconvenient. <words>151</words> These whispers of longing for power, for change, for simple survival, echoed even in the arrangement of the palace gardens, and Mei felt them coalesce here. <words>179</words> She wasn't stopping a birth; she was subtly altering the narrative thread itself. <words>193</words> Her movements were precise, dictated by the pattern of a butterfly's wings â€“ specifically, the iridescent blue Papilio paris, known for its deceptive flight. <words>220</words> Each placement had to mimic the seemingly random, yet mathematically perfect, distribution of scales on its wings. <words>239</words> It was a method whispered down through her order, designed to introduce elegant chaos into predetermined fates. <words>258</words> The aim was to amalgamate the potent magical residue of the plants with the ambient anxieties of the court, creating a minor, diverting event instead of a dynasty-ending one. <words>289</words> A diverting event that would, ideally, make the concubine seem blessed rather than cursed, perhaps predicting a future poet, not a world-eater. <words>315</words> Mei considered the prophecy figuratively literal; it pointed towards *a* significant birth, but the apocalyptic details were likely just panicked metaphors. <words>340</words> Or perhaps, she mused, tightening the press screw by screw, the shadow *was* literal, and she was merely ensuring it would be cast by a particularly fetching lampshade the concubine would receive as a gift. <words>378</words> Such were the absurdities required to maintain imperial stability, a task far funnier than simple murder. <words>397</words> She worked calmly, the silence stretching, thick with unspoken dread and the scent of crushed petals. <words>415</words> The final turn of the screw sealed the floral arrangement, a compressed bundle of redirected destiny. <words>432</words> Footsteps approached the door, heavy and official. <words>440</words> Mei stood, dusting off her silk trousers, the botanical press now just an innocent artifact on a table. <words>459</words> Let them ask; the future was already blooming differently. <words>470</words>
