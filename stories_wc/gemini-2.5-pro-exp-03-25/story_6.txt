Elara, a minstrel whose ballads mostly mocked heroes, didn't believe in much, least of all immortal tricksters like Flickerfoot. <words>19</words> Yet, here she was, deep within the echoing shell of a defunct disappearing ink factory, intent on beating the cosmic jester at his own game. <words>43</words> Her motivation was simple: Flickerfoot had swapped her prize-winning lute for a kazoo during the Midwinter Festival, and revenge tasted sweeter than doubt. <words>66</words> The timeframe was precise – the hush of an empty mailbox at midday, when Flickerfoot supposedly took his only moment of predictable rest. <words>89</words> Sunlight streamed through grimy skylights, illuminating dust motes dancing in the chemically-tinged air where vats once brewed ephemeral pigments. <words>111</words> Elara clutched her weapon: a sturdy Y-shaped pipe fitting repurposed into a slingshot. <words>126</words> Her ammunition was a single, iridescent scrap of dragon-scale armor, supposedly shed by Ignis the Incandescent millennia ago, and Flickerfoot’s most coveted, unobtainable treasure. <words>153</words> Giving it to him seemed insane, an act of reckless generosity bordering on lunacy, but that was the core of her impossibly plausible plan. <words>179</words> Flickerfoot expected schemes, theft, and elaborate traps, not a freely offered gift delivered with unconventional velocity. <words>198</words> She positioned herself near the factory's heart, where an ancient steam vent sighed a rhythmic, metallic hiss. <words>218</words> Decades of disuse hadn't fully silenced the geothermal pressure below, a forgotten power source for her absurd delivery system. <words>240</words> According to a crumbling schematic she'd 'borrowed', this specific vent pulsed strongest precisely at the midday hush. <words>259</words> Elara loaded the shimmering dragon-scale armor scrap into the slingshot's pouch, aiming it directly into the vent's opening. <words>280</words> The idea was to use the steam's forceful expulsion not to launch the pouch, but to propel the scale *out* of the pouch at incredible speed via the hiss of an ancient steam vent in an abandoned factory, straight towards Flickerfoot’s predicted napping spot near the leaky ceiling. <words>334</words> It was Rube Goldberg meets divine intervention, fueled by spite and geothermal energy. <words>349</words> As the factory fell into that specific midday quiet, the silence amplifying the distant clatter of a loose shutter, the vent gave a preparatory shudder. <words>376</words> Elara held her breath, a grin mixing irreverent awe with sheer disbelief playing on her lips; this was monumentally stupid, yet potentially glorious. <words>402</words> With a sudden, powerful WHOOSH, the steam erupted, catching the dragon scale perfectly. <words>416</words> The iridescent shard shot upwards like a tiny, glittering missile, disappearing through a crack in the mezzanine floor above. <words>436</words> A startled yelp, distinctly inhuman and utterly outraged, echoed down, followed by the faint, infuriating sound of a kazoo playing off-key. <words>459</words> Elara, the skeptical minstrel, allowed herself a moment of pure, unadulterated triumph before grabbing her actual lute from where Flickerfoot had carelessly stashed it behind a corroded ink mixer and making a swift exit. <words>498</words>
