Barnaby, the town's perpetually groggy brewer, leaned against a crumbling angel statue, the damp chill of the haunted mansion graveyard seeping into his worn coat. <words>26</words> Outside the rusted gates, the protest had hit a lull, a pregnant pause before the shouting inevitably gathered again, like storm clouds mustering. <words>51</words> "Another Tuesday," he muttered, pulling a shard of broken mirror from his pocket, a souvenir from a less spectral pub brawl. <words>74</words> He squinted into the reflection, not at his own bleary face, but angling it towards the dilapidated Blackwood Mansion looming behind him. <words>98</words> His motivation wasn't grand heroism or civic duty, just a stubborn desire to become a living embodiment of his values: simple craft, enduring quality, and not being a bloody hypocrite like the blowhards beyond the fence. <words>143</words> The encroaching darkness wasn't just the failing light; it felt thick, cloying, emanating from the mansion's boarded windows and the very soil beneath his boots. <words>173</words> It was a uniquely generic sort of dread, the kind you read about in cheap novels but felt chillingly real when you were standing in its postcode. <words>204</words> He fiddled with the mirror shard, catching glimpses of the mansion's shadowed interior through a gaping hole where a stained-glass window used to be. <words>233</words> That's when he saw it, barely perceptible even with the mirror's help: the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase deep within the foyer. <words>262</words> It was a faint, sickly green against the grey stone, almost mocking in its subtlety. <words>278</words> Most would miss it, dismiss it as mould or decay, but Barnaby felt a jolt, a weird resonance. <words>299</words> This was the sign, the starting pistol for... well, for something decidedly un-Barnaby-like. <words>316</words> He had to initiate. <words>320</words> Initiate what, precisely, was still fuzzy, like a poorly filtered ale, but the feeling was undeniable. <words>339</words> Perhaps it was time to brew something stronger than stout, something to push back the gloom, metaphorically speaking, of course. <words>361</words> Or perhaps, he thought with a grimace that might have been a smile, it was time to see if the mansion's legendary spectral butler actually existed and if he fancied a pint. <words>398</words> With a sigh that ruffled the silence just as the protest chants began to swell anew, Barnaby pushed himself off the angel. <words>423</words> "Right then," he addressed the darkness, the mansion, and the indifferent gravestones, his tone dripping with flippant solemnity, "Let's see about that discoloration, shall we?" <words>453</words> He pocketed the mirror shard, a tiny, sharp promise against the overwhelming gloom, and took a step towards the mansion's rotting porch. <words>479</words> Time to embody some values, even if they involved potential trespassing and definite weirdness. <words>495</words>
