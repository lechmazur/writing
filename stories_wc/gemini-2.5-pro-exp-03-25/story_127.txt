Silas slumped onto a plush, gear-patterned ottoman in The Cog & Compass lounge, the scent of machine oil and spiced rum thick in the air. <words>24</words> His usual cascade of clockwork juggling ideas had dried up completely, leaving him frustratingly, creatively blocked. <words>40</words> He was merely Silas the street performer here, a flimsy disguise hiding a past far more complex and dangerous. <words>59</words> Tucked inside his worn satchel, cold against his thigh, lay the rusted knight’s gauntlet, a heavy secret heavier than its pitted steel. <words>82</words> He was between calls, a tense limbo where old allegiances whispered and new dangers brewed. <words>98</words> Tonight, the silence screamed louder than the lounge's whirring automatons. <words>109</words> His fingers tightened, an unconscious gesture reflecting the coded desperation knotting his insides. <words>124</words> He had to reach out, to offer peace to a sworn adversary, a move that felt both insane and utterly necessary. <words>145</words> But the method, the specific sequence needed to initiate contact safely, eluded his frantic thoughts. <words>161</words> His gaze drifted across the lounge, past brass pipes and flickering vacuum tubes, settling on an elaborate, bio-luminescent coral reef sculpture dominating one wall. <words>188</words> It was an oddity even for this place, intricate and strangely organic amidst the mechanics. <words>205</words> He needed to remember the sequence, the one tied to the gauntlet and the man who’d once worn its twin. <words>226</words> Focusing intently, Silas let his mind trace the complex, abrasive texture of the sculpted coral, imagining the feel of it beneath his fingertips. <words>252</words> He pictured the tiny polyps, the sharp ridges, the smooth, worn patches, letting the tactile sensation fill his awareness. <words>274</words> Slowly, like silt settling in still water, the memory surfaced, triggered not by sight but by the imagined feel, the specific roughness mirroring a code etched long ago. <words>306</words> It was a sequence keyed to the very imperfections on the gauntlet he carried, a fail-safe designed by his adversary himself, back when they fought on the same side. <words>339</words> The adversary, General Thorne, the man whose career Silas had inadvertently ruined, the man who now held a key piece of volatile information Silas desperately needed neutralized for the greater good. <words>377</words> Offering peace wasn't just strategy; it was a fragile attempt at atonement, a hope for a trust renewed against impossible odds. <words>401</words> The desperation remained, a cold undercurrent, but now it had direction. <words>414</words> Silas pushed himself up, the gauntlet feeling less like a burden and more like a key. <words>432</words> He knew the sequence now, recalled via the phantom touch of a coral reef in a steampunk bar. <words>452</words> He moved towards the lounge's private communication booth, the first step towards a dangerous reconciliation taken between calls. <words>473</words>
