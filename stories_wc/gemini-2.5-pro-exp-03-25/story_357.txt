Elara considered herself a focused collector, primarily of moments where she hadn't succumbed entirely to the void. <words>17</words> Tonight's addition was proving... unique: playing 'Caverns of Gloomfang' inside what was undeniably an actual frost giant's lair. <words>37</words> "Your move, bone-chiller," Kaelen nudged, his voice echoing slightly off the icy walls adorned with colossal, primitive axes. <words>55</words> Elara, seldom odd in her outward presentation despite her internal landscape, merely raised an eyebrow. <words>70</words> This whole bizarre scenario began with a sudden invitation to a party, scrawled on a napkin left by Kaelen – "Game night, Bjorn's winter lodge (BYO torch)". <words>96</words> Bjorn, apparently, had inherited his great-great-uncle's oversized, frost-covered real estate. <words>109</words> The first round passed in a blur of dice rolls and navigating miniature heroes past crudely drawn stalagmites on the game board, which rested precariously on a giant's discarded kneecap guard. <words>143</words> Elara usually preferred embracing solitude, finding it a sturdy shield against the alpha predator called despair that stalked the edges of her mind. <words>168</words> Yet, here she was, surrounded by cheerful adventurers and the faint, unsettling smell of frozen mammoth. <words>185</words> "Right, advancing my Gloom Stalker," she announced, her tone a careful blend of earnest flippancy, pushing the pewter figure across the board. <words>208</words> During the second round, while Kaelen argued about line-of-sight rules behind a massive drinking horn someone was using as cover, Elara discreetly opened her worn journal. <words>239</words> Pinned carefully beneath a clear protective sheet was a pressed black rose, brittle and perfect – a memento from a particularly bleak winter solstice she'd navigated alone. <words>268</words> It was a reminder that solitude wasn't failure; it was a different kind of strength, a deliberate choice. <words>287</words> This forced camaraderie, this game night absurdity in a giant's frozen living room, felt like an attempt to unravel that carefully constructed strength. <words>313</words> Was she diluting her defenses, or merely testing their flexibility? <words>324</words> The third round began, the objective: defeat the 'Ice Wyrm of Sorrow'. <words>337</words> How terribly on the nose, she thought, almost smiling. <words>347</words> Maybe triumph over an alpha predator called despair didn't always mean locking the door and drawing the curtains. <words>367</words> Perhaps sometimes it meant rolling dice with questionable companions in an impossibly cold, ridiculously oversized hovel, acknowledging the predator but refusing to let it dictate the terms of engagement. <words>401</words> She looked at the black rose again, then closed the journal firmly. <words>414</words> Solitude was her fortress, yes, but tonight, she was making a tactical sortie into enemy territory, armed with dice and a wry observation. <words>441</words> "Okay, Kaelen, stop whining," she said, focusing intently on the board, "Let's slay this overgrown ice-lizard; I've got despair to conquer, metaphorically speaking, and I'd like to get back to my regularly scheduled brooding before dawn." <words>481</words> </words>
