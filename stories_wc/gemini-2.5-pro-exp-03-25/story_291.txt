Captain Eva Rostova, once commander of the star-freighter 'Nomad', stepped into the House of Infinite Reflections, the air thick with dust and decay. <words>23</words> Outside, beyond the peeling paint of the abandoned amusement park gates, the orchard cat dozes beneath a dying tree, oblivious. <words>42</words> The mirror maze pulsed with a low thrum, a calculated wilderness of distorted glass and shadow. <words>58</words> Eva clutched a small, frayed coil of rope in her pocket, a tangible piece of the prison escape that had defined her early rebellion. <words>82</words> She was here not for thrills, but to stand guard over her own spark of defiance, a flame threatened by whispers she couldn't quite place. <words>109</words> They called her reckless, unnatural for a woman of the Outer Colonies, prejudice sharp as shattered glass. <words>128</words> This haunted place, they said, preyed on fractured souls; she considered it a proving ground. <words>145</words> Strange cosmic echoes seemed to ripple through the mirrored corridors, distorting her reflection into monstrous caricatures – the very images her detractors painted. <words>171</words> One panel showed her leering, avaricious; another, brittle and incompetent. <words>182</words> These were the lies spun from fear and ignorance, the essence of the prejudice she fought daily. <words>199</words> Eva navigated the labyrinth with movements that seemed haphazard, a deliberately accidental stumbling that brought her face-to-face with the most grotesque reflections. <words>227</words> A lesser soul might flinch, might believe the warped glass. <words>239</words> But Eva, the daring ship captain who’d faced down pirates and nebulas, met each distorted image with a steady gaze. <words>261</words> She chose to overlook the monstrous shapes, recognizing them not as truth, but as echoes of others' malice amplified by the maze's strange energies. <words>289</words> The rope in her pocket felt warm, a reminder of breaking free, of choosing her own path despite the walls built around her. <words>314</words> Confronting prejudice wasn't always about shouting; sometimes it was about refusing to see yourself through poisoned eyes. <words>334</words> The cosmic echoes swirled, whispering doubts, amplifying fears, trying to find purchase. <words>348</words> She bumped a panel, seemingly by chance, triggering a cascade of flickering lights that momentarily banished the worst reflections. <words>369</words> It was a small victory, won through calculated misdirection in this wilderness of mirrors. <words>384</words> She saw a flicker of her true self – determined, scarred, but unbroken. <words>397</words> That was the spark she guarded. <words>404</words> Emerging back into the weak afternoon light, Eva left the haunted maze and its echoing judgments behind, the frayed rope a silent promise against future prisons, real or perceived. <words>438</words> The orchard cat stretched, yawned, and settled back to sleep beneath the skeletal tree, the captain's inner battle unseen, unheard, but decisively won. <words>464</words> </story>
