Barnaby "Blink" Fitzwilliam, former child star extraordinaire, grinned maniacally at the humming machinery surrounding him. <words>16</words> He was, by any clinical or societal standard, authentically odd, a state cultivated long after the sitcom cancellation. <words>33</words> This vibration analysis chamber, usually reserved for testing aerospace components, felt more like home than any Malibu mansion ever had. <words>52</words> The air thrummed with a low, resonant frequency, focused intently on the salvaged artifact before him: a section of ancient, etched glass from the ruined St. Dismas Cathedral. <words>79</words> Fitzwilliam smoothed the crumpled treasure map on the console, its cryptic symbols finally making sense now, after the last secret is revealed. <words>101</words> The map hadn't led to gold, but to this frequency, this specific pane, this precise moment. <words>118</words> His ambition hadn't died with his career; it had merely mutated, festering into a desperate need for something *more* than fleeting fame. <words>141</words> He'd paid the price of ambition once, sacrificing childhood for applause, and now he sought a different kind of power, one the tabloids couldn't touch. <words>168</words> His motivation was stark, terrifying, exhilarating: to tap into the wild magic of madness itself, believing it the ultimate, untamed energy source. <words>192</words> The readouts flickered, confirming the resonance lock. <words>199</words> "Showtime, you glorious disaster," he whispered to the glass, his tone pure irreverent awe. <words>213</words> He adjusted a dial, increasing the sonic pressure minutely. <words>222</words> On the monitor displaying the glass's microscopic structure, a faint light began to trickle. <words>236</words> It wasn't reflecting off the surface; it was emerging from within, navigating the hidden layers of etched glass in the cathedral window fragment. <words>259</words> The map had shown how the artisans, centuries ago, had unknowingly trapped echoes of psychic energy, prayers turned frantic, within the silica structure through unique vibrational etching methods. <words>289</words> The chamber's focused sonic waves were now carefully unlocking those layers, releasing the stored, chaotic potential. <words>306</words> Fitzwilliam watched, eyes wide, not with fear, but with the hungry anticipation of an addict promised the ultimate high. <words>327</words> This wasn't just data; it was raw, unfiltered consciousness, the psychic residue of centuries of desperate faith and existential terror. <words>349</words> The light intensified, the trickle becoming a shimmering stream flowing through the impossible geometry carved within the glass. <words>369</words> He could almost feel it coalescing in the air, a static charge promising beautiful, terrible enlightenment. <words>386</words> The price of his first ambition had been sanity; the price of this one might be reality itself, and Fitzwilliam couldn't wait to pay. <words>411</words> The chamber hummed louder, the light pulsed brighter, and the wild magic began its insidious seep into the sterile room, drawn to the odd, broken star who had called it forth. <words>443</words> </words>
