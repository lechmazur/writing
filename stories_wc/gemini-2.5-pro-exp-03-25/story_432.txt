Kaelen, whose long career tasting poisons had paradoxically sharpened his senses while nurturing a quiet death wish, knelt beside the roaring subterranean waterfall. <words>24</words> The air thrummed, thick with moisture and a power only perceptible to those like him, those who walked the edge. <words>43</words> His motivation was singular: to map the energy flows converging in this hidden nexus, a task deemed impossible by most. <words>62</words> His method was unconventional, relying on interpreting the frantic, often nonsensical calls flooding late-night talk-radio psychic hotlines, filtering truth from delusion. <words>87</words> He believed fragments of raw energetic data leaked through these desperate human transmissions, unnoticed by the mundane world but vital for his work. <words>111</words> Before him, shimmering under the phosphorescent glow of unique fungi, stood a massive, intricately carved ice sculpture of a coiled serpent, a temporary monument erected by one of the hidden societies that monitored such places. <words>149</words> Kaelen knew its existence was tied intrinsically to the energy patterns he sought to understand, a focus point rapidly destabilizing. <words>173</words> Water dripped faster now, the sound a frantic counterpoint to the waterfall's deep bass rumble; internal fractures webbed the translucent form. <words>197</words> He held a small radio, the tinny voice of a psychic barely audible over the cascade, speaking soothingly to a caller terrified of shadows in their home. <words>226</words> Kaelen wasn't listening to the words, but the cadence, the pauses, the static bursts â€“ translating them into a complex, shifting map within his mind. <words>253</words> This convergence felt strangely compelling, a nexus of natural power, hidden knowledge, and broadcasted human fear. <words>272</words> He pulled a simple cloth bookmark from his worn journal, its fabric cool against his skin despite the humid air. <words>294</words> It wasn't for marking pages, but for grounding, a familiar texture in the face of overwhelming forces. <words>314</words> The ice sculpture groaned, a deep, resonant sound that vibrated through the stone floor, signaling imminent collapse. <words>334</words> This was it, the moment of chaotic release, the peak of the energy surge he needed to witness, perhaps even survive, perhaps not. <words>359</words> A serene upheaval washed over him; the acceptance of his death wish warred with the intense focus required for his task. <words>383</words> In the final second before the ice sculpture exploded into a thousand glittering shards, Kaelen focused his entire will, using the psychic's last garbled transmission and the bookmark as an anchor, attempting to mentally bind the volatile energy signature, to capture its essence on his internal map before it dissipated forever. <words>443</words> The roar of the falls and the shattering ice became one deafening, strangely peaceful sound as the energy washed over him. <words>464</words>
