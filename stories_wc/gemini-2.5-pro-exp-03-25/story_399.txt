Elias, caretaker of crypts both stone and soul, scowled at the glittering chaos of the witch’s crystal scrying room. <words>20</words> Starlight fractured through a dozen hanging prisms, painting shifting mosaics on the floor where the intricate sand mandala lay. <words>40</words> He was here, reluctantly, throughout the slow procession of stargazing, seeking a path through the labyrinth of his own making. <words>61</words> His purpose was stark: to quell an uprising within, a mutiny of fractured memories clawing at the walls of his composure. <words>84</words> Decades of tending to the dead had taught him the grim importance of trauma; it wasn't merely damage, but a foundation, however unstable. <words>110</words> Ignoring it only gave the ghosts more power. <words>119</words>

He knelt, joints protesting, beside the vibrant circle of coloured sand. <words>132</words> His method tonight was unconventional, learned from a brittle scroll found tucked in a sarcophagus: divination through the patterns in a sand mandala, specifically one attuned to celestial movements. <words>167</words> He believed the subtle shifts in the design, mirroring the stars, held the key to understanding the discord raging inside him. <words>190</words> Beside him rested an unmarked cardboard tube, deceptively plain, containing consecrated sand from a place of significant personal pain. <words>214</words> He hadn't opened it yet; its presence was enough, a heavy anchor to the past he needed to navigate. <words>236</words>

The uprising felt like a thousand angry voices speaking with one throat, a phenomenon the old texts called 'multiply singular' – one root agony branching into a legion of torments. <words>269</words> Elias traced a swirling blue line in the mandala with a calloused finger, his gaze fixed, searching for meaning in the cosmic dust painting. <words>296</words> He sought not erasure, but integration, a way to silence the clamour by finally acknowledging the legitimacy of its source. <words>321</words> A tremor started in his hand, causing his finger to jiggle almost imperceptibly against the sand, a minute betrayal of the immense pressure he contained. <words>349</words> He steadied himself, breathing deeply, the air thick with the scent of dried herbs and ozone from the crystals. <words>371</words> The patterns seemed to shimmer, offering fleeting glimpses of understanding – a face half-remembered, a choice regretted, the echo of a scream swallowed by time. <words>399</words> With grandiose subtlety, the universe reflected in the sand offered not a cure, but a map of the battlefield within. <words>423</words> Elias adjusted his position, preparing to pour the sand from the unmarked cardboard tube onto a specific junction, hoping to chart a course toward fragile peace before the stars faded with the dawn. <words>461</words> The ghosts within quieted slightly, anticipating the offering, the recognition, the long-overdue parley. <words>478</words>
