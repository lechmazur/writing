Lieutenant Alistair Finch, a naval officer perpetually green around the gills even on solid ground, finally stood before the shimmering crystal fortress nestled at the terminus of the impossible rainbow canyon. <words>31</words> His arrival marked the culmination of a quiet longing that had echoed across centuries, a debt incurred through traded secrets whispered in starlit anchorages long ago. <words>59</words> Clutched tightly in his trembling hand was the price, or perhaps the key: a single, translucent ghost orchid bulb pulsing with faint inner light. <words>84</words> He wasn't a hero, merely a man tired of the reflections shown to him, driven by a desperate need to confront the mirror before it lies again. <words>113</words> The fortress itself seemed to hum, its crystalline facets refracting the canyon's colours into a dizzying, almost nauseating display that did little for Alistair's inherent seasickness. <words>143</words> He fumbled with the ancient charts gifted by the secret-trader, papers brittle with age, detailing the precise celestial alignments needed. <words>166</words> His method was meticulous, born of naval discipline yet applied to arcane purpose: tracking moon phases against the fortress's unique temporal resonance. <words>191</words> A nervous cough escaped him as a guard, carved seemingly from amethyst, regarded him with impassive, glowing eyes. <words>210</words> "Just... admiring the architecture," Alistair stammered, offering a lopsided, hopeful smile – an attempt at being awkwardly charming that felt utterly inadequate. <words>236</words> But the guard remained still, a silent sentinel to the transformation Alistair sought within these prismatic walls. <words>255</words> For centuries, the mirror – be it polished silver, still water, or the judgment in others' eyes – had shown him a wavering, uncertain image. <words>281</words> The traded secrets promised a way to solidify, to become something immutable, something true. <words>298</words> Tonight, the final moon phase aligned, bathing the canyon's end and the crystal fortress in ethereal silver light. <words>319</words> Raising the ghost orchid bulb, Alistair felt its energy surge, connecting with the fortress and the lunar cycle. <words>340</words> A warmth spread through him, unsettling yet resolute, the beginning of the profound change he had bartered his past for. <words>362</words> His form began to shimmer, edges blurring like watercolour in rain, the awkward naval officer starting to dissolve and reform. <words>386</words> It wasn't painful, but intensely strange, a shedding of ill-fitting skin accumulated over lifetimes of misplaced duty and perceived failings. <words>411</words> He felt a nostalgic defiance rise within him, a farewell to the seasick man who feared the horizon. <words>431</words> The bulb dissolved into light, merging with his essence as the crystal walls around him seemed to sing in resonance. <words>453</words> He was becoming part of the fortress, perhaps, or something else entirely, finally ready to face whatever truth the mirror held. <words>478</words> The lies would hold no power now. <words>485</words>
