Finn believed reincarnation was cosmic irony served cold; his latest stint involved tending goldfish in the dust-choked aisles of a forgotten recipe library. <words>24</words> "From emperor to algae-nibbler, now *this*," he muttered, tapping the glass tank where Bartholomew III blew indifferent bubbles. <words>42</words> The library itself was a monument to culinary ghosts, smelling faintly of vanilla extract and existential dread. <words>58</words> Finn’s self-appointed mission, fueled by a playful cynicism barely masking deeper anxieties, was to disrupt the stagnant tradition of utter neglect this place embodied. <words>84</words> He felt a kinship with the forgotten words, the abandoned sauces – another cycle of existence left to gather dust. <words>103</words> Guilt’s haunting echo was a constant companion, a low thrum beneath his thoughts, though its specific source remained frustratingly vague across lifetimes. <words>128</words> Sometimes it felt like the phantom limb of the one-armed toy soldier he’d found wedged between ‘Joy of Jellies’ and ‘Pies of Penitence’. <words>152</words> He kept the soldier perched by the fish tank, a tiny, broken sentinel. <words>165</words>

Suddenly, the gentle afternoon light vanished, replaced by the percussive drumming of rain against the tall, grimy windows. <words>184</words> The sky cracked open with a theatricality Finn almost appreciated. <words>195</words> Moments later, the heavy oak door creaked open, admitting a gust of wind and a woman shaking water from her coat like a startled spaniel. <words>221</words> She looked around, bewildered. <words>226</words> "Is this place... open?" she asked, her voice echoing slightly. <words>237</words> Finn, usually content in his obscurity, felt a flicker of possessiveness. <words>249</words> "Define 'open'," he replied, wiping condensation from Bartholomew's tank. <words>259</words> His stance was relaxed, yet there was a tentatively fierce energy about him, a quiet warning not to disturb his fragile ecosystem of fish and forgotten food. <words>287</words>

"Just needed shelter," she said, gesturing vaguely at the deluge outside. <words>299</words> "Waiting for a call... from the hospital." <words>308</words> Her eyes scanned the shelves, landing on the goldfish tank, then the toy soldier beside it. <words>325</words> "Odd little fellow," she murmured, pointing at the soldier. <words>334</words> "He looks like he's lost something important." <words>342</words> Finn felt an unexpected pang of connection. <words>349</words> "We all have," he said, the cynicism softening for a beat. <words>360</words> He knew this waiting period well, this limbo before the doctor’s chart confirms a turning point, a verdict that could change everything. <words>384</words> He felt an urge, unfamiliar yet strong, to alleviate her obvious anxiety, perhaps even his own lingering guilt in the process. <words>406</words> "There's a surprisingly decent recipe for 'Courage Cake' in that third volume," he offered, nodding towards a particularly dilapidated tome. <words>428</words> "Supposedly fortifies the spirit, though I suspect the sheer amount of brandy does most of the heavy lifting." <words>448</words> She managed a small, watery smile, the first crack in the library's stagnant silence, a tiny disruption he welcomed. <words>467</words> Maybe shared waiting, even amongst forgotten recipes and reincarnated caretakers, was its own kind of solace. <words>484</words>
