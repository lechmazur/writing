The last rumble of thunder faded, leaving the neon-slicked streets of the cyberpunk city night market humming with renewed energy. <words>20</words> Rainwater steamed off overloaded circuits and holographic koi swam through the lingering mist. <words>34</words> Jax, a swashbuckler whose pockets were as empty as his promises, leaned against a flickering noodle stall. <words>51</words> His synth-leather coat was patched with mismatched fabrics, a look decidedly fashionably unfashionable even in this eclectic chaos. <words>71</words> A sigh escaped him, a puff of vapor in the cool air, betraying a fervent apathy that barely masked a deeper current. <words>93</words> He needed credits, badly, not for himself, but for the kid hiding in the abandoned data haven, the one who still believed in stories that didn't end in betrayal. <words>126</words> This drive to shelter kindness in a world seemingly determined to extinguish it was a ridiculous, dangerous burden. <words>145</words> The usual channels were dry; debts called in, favors expired like cheap synth-ale. <words>160</words> Adversity wasn't new, just the particular flavor of desperation this time felt sharper, colder. <words>176</words> He pushed off the stall, melting into the throng of chrome-limbed couriers and bio-modded vendors. <words>193</words> His rented sleep-pod above the market was cramped, smelling faintly of ozone and regret. <words>210</words> Kneeling on the grimy floor, Jax retrieved a small, velvet pouch from beneath the thin mattress frame. <words>229</words> Inside weren't jewels or data chips, but a handful of antique marbles, their glass surfaces chipped and worn. <words>250</words> He scattered them carefully under the narrow bed, their colours muted in the dim light filtering from the street below. <words>273</words> From his worn coat's inner pocket, he produced a long, slender vintage hatpin, its tarnished silver head catching the faint glow. <words>298</words> This was his method, his strange inheritance from a spacer grandmother who read futures in stardust and engine grease. <words>321</words> He began charting the swirl of antique marbles scattered under the bed, using the hatpin's point to trace invisible lines connecting specific colours and positions. <words>353</words> His focus narrowed, the market's cacophony fading into a low thrum as he mapped the chaotic patterns, seeking a hidden logic, a path through the impossible. <words>384</words> It was a desperate sort of divination, a way to force an answer from the universe's static. <words>403</words> Slowly, a pattern emerged, a convergence point near the old, decommissioned sky-docks. <words>419</words> A low hum began to emit from the hatpin's tip, a subtle vibration only he could feel, confirming the route. <words>441</words> Hope, fragile but persistent, flickered within his carefully cultivated indifference; the kid would get their passage out. <words>462</words> Jax stood, tucking the hatpin and marbles away, his face settling back into its mask of weary nonchalance as he prepared to face the neon jungle once more. <words>494</words>
