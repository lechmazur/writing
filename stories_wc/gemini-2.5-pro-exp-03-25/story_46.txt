The blank-faced performer sat nestled within the orchard of giant ferns, the air thick with moisture from the overshadowing waterfalls. <words>21</words> Polished, dark leaves dripped onto the lid of the grand piano, mirroring the constant, percussive spray. <words>36</words> It was during piano practice, the precise notes of a complex sonata cutting through the roar, that the real work began. <words>56</words> Their face, devoid of any discernible emotion, was uniquely typical – a mask so common it became strange in its perfection. <words>77</words> This performer held a specific, silent duty; they were the guardian of rumors. <words>90</words> Whispers and half-truths drifted on the mist like spores, seeking fertile ground in waking minds. <words>106</words> The performer’s motivation was singular, an obsession bordering on precise madness: to learn the language of dreams. <words>124</words> They believed the chaotic logic of rumor was the closest waking equivalent to the syntax of sleep. <words>141</words> Therefore, they curated the flow, deciding which nascent tales deserved life. <words>153</words> The method was esoteric, demanding intense focus amidst the cascading water and demanding music: by tracking moon paths. <words>173</words> Moonlight, fragmented by the giant fronds and the spray, cast shifting patterns across the piano keys, the damp earth, and the performer’s still hands. <words>199</words> They charted these ephemeral trails, correlating their trajectories with the resonance of the rumors felt psychically in the humid air. <words>221</words> On their right hand rested a plain plastic ring, startlingly mundane against the lush, ancient green. <words>238</words> It served as a focal point, a non-reflective anchor against the shimmering illusions cast by water and light. <words>257</words> Sometimes, a specific lunar reflection aligning with a certain musical phrase indicated a rumor’s potential, its alignment with the deeper dream currents. <words>281</words> Only then would the performer subtly approve its passage. <words>290</words> Approval wasn't a grand gesture, but an internal shift, a focused thought that nudged the chosen rumor into the collective subconscious. <words>313</words> A barely perceptible nod, synchronized with a resolving chord, might seal a story’s fate, sending it out beyond the ferns. <words>335</words> Each approved rumor was a captured syllable, a potential phoneme in the elusive lexicon of the sleeping world. <words>354</words> The waterfalls thundered, the ferns dripped, and the piano sang its intricate tune, a bizarrely beautiful engine for deciphering night thoughts. <words>377</words> The blank face remained unchanged, listening intently to the music, the water, the moonlight, and the silent scream of burgeoning myths. <words>399</words> The uniquely typical guardian continued their meticulous work, sorting the whispers, driven by the precise madness of their quest to understand what happened when eyes closed and the world dissolved into symbols. <words>436</words> Every tracked path, every approved lie, was a step closer to fluency in the forgotten tongue spoken only in slumber. <words>457</words> The plastic ring gleamed dully, a small, solid point in the swirling, damp symphony of curated chaos and dream interpretation. <words>479</words>
