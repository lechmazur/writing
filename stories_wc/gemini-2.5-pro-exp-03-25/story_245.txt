Jax pounded his worn boots against the cracked ferrocrete of the abandoned spaceport flight deck, each stride jarring. <words>18</words> He was jogging again, trying to outrun the fury coiling in his gut after the botched spice run. <words>35</words> Damn regulators, damn informants, damn this whole cursed sector. <words>44</words> His hand reflexively tightened around the single, smooth wood chopstick tucked into his waistband, a relic of a life that felt galaxies away. <words>67</words> Elara’s chopstick, the only thing he’d grabbed. <words>75</words> The memory of her laughter felt abstractly physical, a warmth ghosting his skin that the biting wind couldn't erase. <words>94</words> It was this memory, this constant ache, that fueled the heart's revolt simmering beneath his irate surface. <words>111</words> He hated this existence – the endless running, the paranoia, the stench of decay clinging to places like this forgotten launchpad. <words>133</words> He slowed his pace near the shattered control tower, pulling a small, dented thermos from his pack. <words>150</words> Inside wasn't nutrient paste, but lukewarm water and crushed, dried leaves scavenged from the hydroponics bay ruins. <words>169</words> He needed to memorialize her, not just with rage, but with ritual. <words>182</words> Using the lone chopstick, he carefully stirred the murky infusion, his calloused fingers surprisingly steady. <words>199</words> His method was unconventional, learned from a star-drifter long ago: seeking guidance through patterns in tea leaves, or whatever passed for them out here. <words>226</words> He squinted, trying to decipher the swirls and sediment clinging to the metal cup’s bottom. <words>242</words> Was that a cascade? <words>246</words> A path? <words>248</words> His true motivation, the one he barely admitted even to himself, wasn't just escape or credits; it was to find hidden waterfalls. <words>273</words> Not just any waterfalls, but the shimmering, gravity-defying cascades whispered about in spacers' myths, the ones on Cygnus X-1's lost moon that Elara had dreamed of visiting. <words>304</words> A place of impossible beauty, a stark contrast to the grime he lived in. <words>319</words> "Just tell me how to get there, Elara," he muttered, the words raw with a biting sincerity that surprised even him. <words>340</words> The leaves offered no clear map, just fragmented shapes mocking his desperation. <words>353</words> He hurled the thermos against the tower base, the clang echoing across the desolate flight deck. <words>370</words> The revolt in his chest surged, a painful reminder that wanting something pure in a life this dirty was its own kind of torment. <words>396</words> Wiping grit from his face, he retrieved the chopstick, its smooth surface a small anchor in the chaos. <words>416</words> He tucked it away safely, the search wasn't over, not while her memory burned. <words>432</words> He started jogging again, faster this time, chasing a phantom cascade across the ruins of forgotten ambition. <words>451</words> The waterfalls were out there, somewhere beyond the reach of regulators and regrets, and damn it all, he would find them. <words>475</words>
