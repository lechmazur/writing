Jax, who'd once been a careless pilot before gravity and enchantment claimed his biplane, wandered the twisted orchard labyrinth with a deliberately dreamy air. <words>24</words> The air hung thick and still in the lull between echoing thunder and the imminent fresh rain, smelling of ozone and damp oak leaves. <words>46</words> Gnarled apple trees, heavy with fruit that shimmered unnaturally, formed walls that shifted when he wasn't looking directly at them. <words>66</words> His purpose here, accepted with a sigh that somehow tasted like a cheer, was to archive the grove's impossible natural patterns. <words>86</words> He believed these patterns held a kind of truth, a language older than words. <words>100</words> But something corrupted them, something sinister whispered through the borrowed memories clinging to this place like morning mist. <words>119</words> These weren't his memories, but echoes absorbed from the enchanted oak grove itself, confusing and potent. <words>136</words> His method was peculiar, dictated by the labyrinth's own logic: investigating the sinister doodles scrawled across a collection of used postcards he'd found scattered near his crash site. <words>168</words> Each postcard depicted a mundane scene – a seaside pier, a mountain vista – but overlaid were frantic, spidery drawings that pulsed with a dark energy, warping the underlying image. <words>197</words> He suspected these doodles were attempts to capture, or perhaps imprison, the very patterns he sought. <words>215</words> His goal, therefore, was to emancipate these pure forms, to free them from the parasitic ink. <words>233</words> He pulled a worn-out glove onto his left hand, the leather cracked and stained, a relic from his flying days. <words>254</words> It felt less like protection and more like an anchor to a self that was rapidly dissolving into the grove's strange embrace. <words>277</words> Holding a postcard depicting a smiling family picnic, now marred by jagged spirals emanating from the wicker basket, Jax focused. <words>299</words> He let the deliberately dreamy state deepen, allowing the borrowed memories associated with the postcard's origin – salt spray, distant laughter – to surface alongside the grove's own ancient consciousness. <words>331</words> He traced the doodle not with his finger, but with his attention, feeling the resistance, the wrongness of it against the memory of sunlight on grass. <words>358</words> With a soft mental push, fueled by that unique blend of resigned exuberance, he tried to unravel the doodle's hold, to separate it from the underlying pattern it mimicked and distorted. <words>391</words> A faint shimmer detached from the postcard, a fleeting geometric shape of pure light, before dissolving into the waiting air. <words>412</words> It wasn't much, but it was progress, an act of quiet liberation in the heart of the enchanted maze. <words>432</words> Another rumble of thunder echoed, closer now, promising rain to wash the air clean. <words>447</words> Jax smiled, a weary but bright expression, and picked up the next postcard, ready to continue his strange archiving before the storm broke. <words>471</words>
