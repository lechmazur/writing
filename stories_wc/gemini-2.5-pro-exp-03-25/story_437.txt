Rain drummed a melancholic rhythm against the vast, poly-carbonate domes arching over the greenhouse city, a fragile shield against the perpetually toxic ochre sky. <words>26</words>
Inside, amid the humid profusion of genetically engineered flora, Brother Elms adjusted his perpetually slipping spectacles. <words>42</words>
He wasn't much of a leader, more a placeholder buoyed by the desperate hopes of his small flock, a truly spineless man adrift in a sea of wilting faith. <words>72</words>
His true passion, the quiet obsession driving his hollow pronouncements, was the desperate need to understand the language of flowers. <words>95</words>
He believed the silent blooms held secrets the toxic world outside had long choked into oblivion. <words>112</words>
On a nearby potting bench, nestled between wilting petunias and nutrient paste dispensers, sat a small ceramic owl figurine. <words>134</words>
Its wide, painted eyes seemed to hold an ancient, unblinking knowledge, a presence both fixed and watchful – statically dynamic in its silent judgment. <words>161</words>
Elms often felt it observed his fumbling attempts to influence his followers, his methods far removed from fiery sermons or grand prophecies. <words>187</words>
Instead, he relied on subtler means, blurring boundaries between shared grief and manufactured connection. <words>204</words>
He would gather his followers in the damp warmth of the central arboretum, the rain outside a constant, mournful sigh. <words>227</words>
With a practiced air of doleful cheer, he'd produce a worn album filled with faded photographs from the 'Before Times'. <words>251</words>
"See here," he'd murmur, pointing a trembling finger, "Anya loved sunflowers, their faces always turned towards the light we've lost." <words>277</words>
His true tool, however, was the faint shimmer of long-dried tears visible on the surface of these cherished images, captured moments of genuine sorrow from relatives now gone. <words>313</words>
He'd trace these spectral marks, letting the reflected light catch the eyes of his flock, suggesting a shared, sacred pain that bound them together under his gentle, inadequate guidance. <words>351</words>
It was a quiet manipulation, leveraging past heartbreak to cultivate present loyalty, blurring the lines between empathy and exploitation. <words>376</words>
The followers, starved for meaning beneath the poisoned heavens, readily accepted this borrowed grief, mistaking Elms's weakness for sensitivity. <words>401</words>
He hoped that by immersing himself and others in these echoes of emotion, somehow, the flowers – the stoic, vibrant survivors – would finally whisper their truths to him. <words>435</words>
Perhaps understanding a rose's resilience or a lily's lament would grant him the strength he so profoundly lacked. <words>457</words>
Until then, he'd continue his pathetic charade, surrounded by life he couldn't comprehend, beneath a sky that promised only decay, clutching faded sorrows under the owl's unchanging gaze. <words>494</words>
