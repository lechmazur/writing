Elara, understudy sorcerer extraordinaire (at least in her own mind), adjusted her spectacles, the humid air of the salt crystal growing chamber fogging the lenses momentarily. <words>26</words> "Terribly sorry to intrude on your… crystallizing," she murmured to the glittering formations scaling the damp walls. <words>43</words> The rhythmic thumping of the laundry cycles down the hall provided a strangely domestic counterpoint to the arcane preparations. <words>62</words> Beside her rested a small cardboard box, unassuming yet crucial. <words>73</words> Inside, nestled on cotton wool, was a single, petrified acorn from the Whispering Grove. <words>88</words> "If you wouldn't mind awfully," she addressed the box, "we have some eavesdropping to do." <words>104</words> Her current project, a rather ambitious attempt to track cultural evolution, involved the delicate core concept of waking the unheard. <words>125</words> Specifically, she aimed to capture the lingering psychic residue imprinted upon the ancient oaks, the spectral gossip of millennia. <words>145</words> The salt chamber, with its unique resonant frequencies amplified by the growing crystals, was perfect for tuning into such faint signals, especially during the relative quiet between spin cycles. <words>175</words> Her method required her to gently hinder the natural decay of these ethereal whispers, coaxing them into coherence just long enough for transcription. <words>199</words> Placing the acorn box atop a particularly large, humming crystal cluster, Elara began the soft chant, her voice obnoxiously polite even when commanding forgotten energies. <words>228</words> "Excuse me, venerable spirits of the grove, might I trouble you for just a moment of your time?" <words>247</words> A faint susurrus answered, not through her ears, but directly into her mind, facilitated by the salt and the acorn's connection. <words>270</words> At first, it was merely static, the background noise of ages. <words>281</words> Then, fragments emerged – snippets of forgotten languages, echoes of laughter, the chilling cry of a long-extinct bird. <words>301</words> A playful dread began to prickle along her spine; this was working far better than her tutor's dismissive predictions. <words>322</words> She focused, pushing more will into the spell, determined to hinder the whispers' retreat back into silence. <words>340</words> "So terribly fascinating," she whispered, scribbling notes furiously, "though, begging your pardon, some of you sound rather cross." <words>360</words> The whispers intensified, swirling, no longer just echoes but something coalescing, gaining a semblance of awareness. <words>378</words> They weren't just the unheard; they were the unheard who hadn't appreciated being woken, especially not by someone asking so very nicely while essentially pickpocketing their history. <words>408</words> The laundry machine clicked, signalling the start of the final rinse cycle, but Elara barely noticed. <words>425</words> The playful dread had curdled, leaving only dread, as the whispers started asking, with chilling politeness, precisely who had disturbed their slumber. <words>450</words> The small cardboard box on the salt crystal began to vibrate, not from the laundry, but from the sheer, ancient indignation welling up within it. <words>476</words> "Oh dear," Elara breathed, adjusting her spectacles again, "Perhaps I should have brought biscuits?" <words>491</words>
