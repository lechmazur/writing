Elias, the seasoned woodsman, felt the familiar ache in his joints as he navigated the overgrown path. <words>16</words> His goal, bordering on obsession, was to map the abandoned railways snaking through this valley. <words>30</words> Locals called it the "radio wave garden," a place where static whispered on the wind and compasses spun erratically. <words>49</words> He needed precise measurements, especially for the collapsed tunnel near the old junction. <words>63</words> His chosen method was unconventional: measuring the echo in an abandoned water tower perched on the ridge above. <words>82</words> He believed the resonant frequencies could reveal the tunnel's extent beneath the earth. <words>96</words> Elias adjusted the tangle of wires connected to his jury-rigged sonic emitter, his grey beard and worn flannel shirt artfully messy from weeks in the wilderness. <words>126</words> A strange, almost despairing cheer filled him whenever he worked; it was better than the crushing silence back home. <words>146</words> He pulled an antique hairbrush from his pack, its silver tarnished, its bristles worn smooth. <words>162</words> It belonged to Martha, and tracing its intricate handle was his only remaining ritual. <words>178</words> He remembered her telling him, just last week, her voice thin, "Find your peace out there, Eli, not just tracks." <words>199</words> He switched on the emitter, sending a pulse towards the rusted behemoth. <words>212</words> Suddenly, a sharp crackle erupted from his receiver, followed by silence – the overloaded amplifier had decided to short-circuit. <words>234</words> Frustration warred with a hollow laugh bubbling in his chest. <words>246</words> Just then, his satellite phone buzzed, a text notification stark against the failing light. <words>262</words> It was from the hospital, a single, coded message they'd agreed upon, signifying the end. <words>279</words> He imagined the final beep of a hospital monitor echoing in the sterile room, a sound far more final than any echo he could measure here. <words>306</words> He sank onto a mossy log, the useless equipment beside him. <words>318</words> Why the railways? <words>322</words> He’d told himself it was important, preserving history, a task worthy of a seasoned woodsman like him. <words>341</words> But staring at the silent receiver, the truth struck him with brutal clarity. <words>355</words> He wasn't mapping railways; he was running away, measuring echoes in empty towers because he couldn't face the silence Martha would leave behind. <words>381</words> Admitting this, truly admitting his fear and avoidance, felt like a physical release, a painful unburdening. <words>399</words> He was freed by honesty, though the freedom tasted like ash. <words>411</words> A single tear cut a path through the grime on his cheek, mingling despair with a strange, quiet relief. <words>431</words> He wouldn't map any more tracks today, maybe not ever. <words>443</words> He picked up the antique hairbrush, holding it tight as the strange whispers of the radio wave garden seemed to soften around him. <words>466</words> The despair remained, but the frantic cheer had finally, blessedly, gone quiet. <words>480</words>
