Lord Ashworth, a noble adrift in the listless quiet before time truly began, adjusted the faded scarf around his neck. <words>19</words> He existed in an era preceding the first spark of sentience, a state of being both naively sophisticated, understanding the theoretical underpinnings of potential reality but utterly bored by its current, vacant state. <words>53</words> His motivation, a nebulous yearning whispered only to the silent void, was to truly grasp the power of intention, to see if thought alone could ripple through the unformed cosmos. <words>84</words> Then, an unexpected invitation materialized not on parchment, but as a resonance within his own awareness – a summons to a spontaneous event. <words>108</words> It proposed a rendezvous, a meeting point designated within the impossible geography of the endless corn maze that rippled across the haunted plain. <words>134</words> This plain wasn't haunted by ghosts of the dead, for none had lived, but by the chilling potential of what might eventually awaken, its vast emptiness amplifying the weight of nascent possibility. <words>169</words> With a sigh that barely disturbed the primordial stillness, Ashworth decided to go, propelled more by ennui than courage. <words>189</words> He stepped onto the plain, the air thick with an ironic awe, the sheer scale of the maze mocking any notion of purpose. <words>214</words> Towering stalks of proto-corn, lacking chlorophyll or life as it would be known, rustled with energies not yet defined as wind. <words>238</words> He navigated by instinct, his sophisticated knowledge useless against the pre-logical twists and turns. <words>254</words> Was he intending his path, or merely subject to the random fluctuations of this nascent reality? <words>271</words> He clutched the faded scarf, a relic from a conceptual 'before' that felt increasingly meaningless, yet it was his only anchor. <words>294</words> Hours, or perhaps eons, passed in the uniform corridors of pale green. <words>307</words> Finally, he reached the coordinates specified by the silent invitation: a small clearing where the corn seemed to hold its breath. <words>330</words> Nothing was there. <words>333</words> No entity, no sign, no revelation, just more endless, waiting corn. <words>345</words> Ashworth stared, the anticlimax profound. <words>350</words> He had intended to find *something*, to witness intention made manifest, and the universe had presented him with... absence. <words>370</words> A slow chuckle started deep within him, bubbling up past the listlessness. <words>381</words> It was absurd, this quest, this setting, his own naive belief that the universe, before consciousness, owed him a neat answer. <words>404</words> His laughter erupted, echoing strangely against the silent stalks, not lonely but resonant, as if the void itself appreciated the joke. <words>427</words> In that moment, he felt a connection, a bizarre camaraderie with the sheer, unthinking irony of existence – a kind of shared laughter with the potential-haunted silence. <words>454</words> Perhaps *this* was the power of intention: not control, but the ability to project meaning, even humor, onto the void and have it echo back in its own inscrutable way. <words>485</words> Turning, leaving the faded scarf tied to a stalk as a marker no one would ever see, Ashworth walked out of the maze, a little less listless, carrying the echo of laughter within him. <words>520</words>
