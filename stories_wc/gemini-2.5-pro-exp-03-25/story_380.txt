Elara, convicted dream thief in a world long past convictions, haunted the forgotten library nestled high within the petrified branches of a colossal, ancient tree. <words>24</words> Outside, the silence of an Earth after the last human child drew breath pressed against the dusty windowpanes. <words>42</words> Inside, only the rustle of brittle pages and Elara’s own uneven breathing disturbed the quiet mania that clung to her like static. <words>63</words> Her motivation was absurd, impossible: to coax thunder from skies that had forgotten the sound of storms, to wring one last, booming echo from the void. <words>89</words>

She hunched over a warped table, fingers tracing patterns in the wood grain, her mind a labyrinth she couldn't map. <words>110</words> Numbers swam before her eyes, refusing to align; calculating the necessary psychic resonance, the precise alignment of stolen dream-shards, felt like trying to hold smoke. <words>137</words> Being mathematically challenged was a cruel joke for someone trying to re-engineer the very fabric of atmospheric phenomena using only ephemeral thought. <words>161</words>

Beside her lay the flimsy photo album, its cover peeling, its contents not faces, but captured moments of slumbering minds – fractured landscapes, impossible physics, echoes of laughter. <words>189</words> It was her collection, her curse, the physical manifestation of her fragmented self, pieced together from the nocturnal wanderings of others. <words>212</words> Each stolen snippet represented a life she hadn't lived, a connection she craved and destroyed in the same breath. <words>233</words>

One particular sequence of dreams always drew her back, depicting figures soaring through canyons of cloud on sleek, impossible sky-boards. <words>256</words> It was Sky-Sail, a sport whispered about in the twilight of human memory, a passion she recognized with a pang that felt almost like her own. <words>282</words> This shared love for a certain sport, albeit one experienced secondhand through pilfered subconsciousness, became her unlikely key. <words>303</words> She believed the collective exhilaration, the remembered G-forces, the phantom roar of the wind from those specific dreams held the necessary charge. <words>328</words>

She gathered the dream-shards depicting Sky-Sail, layering them mentally, trying to synchronize the remembered sensations of speed and air. <words>349</words> The quiet mania intensified, her eyes fixed on the blank, waiting sky visible through a crack in the treehouse wall. <words>370</words> Ignoring the protesting numbers in her head, the equations that refused to balance, she focused solely on the feeling – the drop, the rush, the impossible flight. <words>398</words> With a gasp that tore through the library's silence, Elara gathered all the fragmented joy, terror, and freedom of the Sky-Sailors into herself. <words>424</words> Then, closing her eyes, she took the plunge, not from the treehouse, but deep into the combined psychic energy of those stolen flights, hurling their remembered force outwards. <words>454</words> She strained, listening, waiting for the answering rumble in the desolate heavens, a desperate gambler betting stolen memories against eternal silence. <words>477</words>
