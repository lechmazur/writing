Elara floated, a black velvet sky-lounge adrift above the city that never slept because it never truly saw day. <19> Below, lights sprawled into infinity, a glittering carpet mocking the concept of an edge. <33> Kaelen, the minstrel, strummed a discordant note on his synth-lute, his face a mask of quiet dismay. <49> His melodies, meant to chart the urban sprawl, felt as lost as he did. <63> "Endless," the patrons murmured, sipping nebula-swirl cocktails, but Kaelen clung to a subjectively rational hope: everything has limits. <83> He believed boundaries were drawn somewhere in the perpetual twilight, hidden lines waiting to be rediscovered. <99> His grand, slightly mad project was to draw a map of this endless night, to prove the finite within the infinite. <121> Tonight, like many nights, he wouldn't play; he would excavate. <131> Spread across a low table were dozens of faded polaroid photographs, salvaged from forgotten archives deep within the city's data streams. <154> He studied the old polaroid photographs intently, searching for clues the city itself had forgotten. <170> These weren't just pictures; they were fragments of time, captured amid garden secrets â€“ rooftop havens, bioluminescent courtyards, places where the city's relentless geometry softened. <197> He traced the lines of forgotten walls, the shadows of demolished structures, the ghost-shapes of parks swallowed by chrome and neon. <219> Each photo was a potential coordinate, a hint of a border erased by progress or neglect. <235> He adjusted the cracked crystal lamp, its beam isolating a particularly intriguing image of a walled enclosure overgrown with glowing moss. <257> On his wrist, the broken watch band snagged on his velvet sleeve, its clasp snapped, the timepiece long since surrendered to the city's timelessness. <282> It was a relic from a time *before*, a reminder of why finding an end, any end, felt so vital. <302> He picked up a stylus, its tip hovering over a digital canvas displaying the nascent map, a chaotic web of potential borders. <324> A flicker of laconic exuberance crossed his features, the quiet thrill of the chase against impossible odds. <342> "Almost," he whispered to the silent lounge, the city lights reflecting in his determined eyes. <357> He wasn't digging through dirt, but through layers of manufactured permanence, seeking the original shoreline of this concrete ocean. <378> The garden secrets held the key, the forgotten layouts, the initial drawn boundaries before the sprawl became legend. <398> Another polaroid, another potential anchor point added to the map, a tiny victory against the vast, velvet dark. <417> The dismay hadn't vanished, but it now fueled a focused, almost joyful obsession in the heart of the endless night. <438> He would chart it, one faded photograph, one secret garden, one subjectively rational leap at a time. <457>
