Kaelen, devotee and blade in the service of the Drowned King, drifted along the anemone avenues of the Coral Reef City, technically engaged in one of their mandated "nature walks." <words>29</words> Bioluminescent algae pulsed softly, illuminating the intricate calcium architecture and the schools of jewel-toned fish darting past. <words>48</words> A faint, almost mischievous smile played on Kaelen’s lips, a calculatedly playful mask over solemn purpose. <words>65</words> Clutched loosely in one hand was Barnaby, a faded carnival prize plush, a threadbare purple octopus missing two tentacles, relic of a bewildering surface excursion decades ago. <words>94</words>

These walks were perfect for contemplation, for considering the shimmering, distorted reflection of morality the city founders had so carefully constructed. <words>119</words> Kaelen’s sacred task, their life’s motivation, was nothing less than to retell the grand founding epic from the villain’s view – specifically, that of the Drowned King, unjustly painted as a tyrant. <words>155</words> It was, Kaelen mused while watching a sea cucumber inch along a brain coral, a tragically misunderstood figure who simply wanted unity. <words>180</words> The official histories were, frankly, hilarious in their self-serving righteousness, yet held with such deadly seriousness by the current council. <words>204</words>

To dismantle the lies, Kaelen employed a unique method: analyzing historical broadcasts and testimonies through reversed echoes. <words>225</words> Playing recordings backward, Kaelen found, often revealed subconscious tells, hidden meanings, or structural weaknesses in the speaker's arguments, like listening to a lie unravel back to its insincere origin. <words>259</words> It was painstaking work, requiring immense focus amidst the reef's gentle currents, but essential to consolidate the scattered truths into a coherent counter-narrative. <words>287</words> Each reversed whisper, each backward-spoken justification, chipped away at the heroic facade. <words>302</words>

Kaelen paused, gently squeezing Barnaby’s squishy head, the worn fabric a strange anchor in this fluid world. <words>321</words> The plush was a reminder of the surface world the King’s detractors feared and misrepresented, another piece of the moral puzzle they refused to see clearly. <words>351</words> Tonight’s analysis had been fruitful, revealing a critical vulnerability in the Chief Historian’s latest address defending the founders' actions. <words>374</words> The Historian, Kaelen decided with that same unsettlingly cheerful solemnity, would be the next pillar of the false epic to fall. <words>399</words> It was necessary, almost regrettably amusing, how tidying up history sometimes required making a bit of a mess in the present. <words>424</words> Kaelen adjusted their dive mask, the reflection showing only determined eyes above the playful curve of their mouth, ready to continue the Drowned King's work. <words>451</words> The currents swirled, carrying the silent promise of correction. <words>461</words>
