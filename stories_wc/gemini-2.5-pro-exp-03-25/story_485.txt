Kael, more shadow than substance in the bioluminescent gloom, slipped through the corroded corridors of the forgotten laboratory city beneath the waves. <words>23</words> Above, the surface world boiled with social upheaval, its tremors felt even here in the crushing deep. <words>40</words> She was a brazen raider by trade and necessity, looting forgotten tech, but this dive was different. <words>57</words> Echoes of betrayal slithered like eels in the waterlogged silence, memories of promises broken when the city was first abandoned. <words>78</words> Her target wasn't salvage, but salvation – Dr. Aris, a mind like a dying star, still brilliant but dangerously unstable. <words>100</words> She found him hunched over a console flickering with complex equations, oblivious to the rhythmic clang of approaching submersibles from the warring factions above. <words>128</words> His genius, once celebrated, was now a liability, a prize someone would inevitably try to seize or extinguish. <words>149</words> Kael felt a familiar pang, the urge to protect this fragile flame against the coming storm, a motivation starkly at odds with her usual self-interest. <words>177</words> Trying to reason with Aris in his current state was futile; his focus was absolute, his paranoia legendary since the Great Collapse and the betrayals that followed. <words>208</words> An idea sparked, impulsively thoughtful, dredging up a memory from the water-rat childhood they’d both barely survived in the upper levels before the fall. <words>238</words> She spotted it near a cracked observation dome – a stray piece of charcoal, likely from an old water purifier filter. <words>261</words> Clutching the dark fragment, its rough texture grounding her, Kael moved towards Aris's main schematic display. <words>281</words> She remembered the old dockworker superstitions, the symbols chalked on hulls to ward off bad luck or signal unseen danger. <words>306</words> With swift, practiced movements born of a life in shadows, she drew the jagged, three-pronged sign for 'treacherous currents' directly onto the glowing screen's dusty corner. <words>339</words> It was a crude method, steeped in the youthful superstitions they’d once shared whispered jokes about, a language Aris might subconsciously recognize. <words>366</words> A warning delivered not with words, which he’d dismiss, but through a shared, fractured past. <words>383</words> She paused, the act feeling strangely like both penance and prayer, a moment of fractured grace in the decaying grandeur. <words>405</words> Would the symbol penetrate his obsessive haze? <words>413</words> Would the echoes of their shared youth be enough to warn him of the betrayal closing in? <words>432</words> Kael didn't wait for an answer, melting back into the labyrinthine passages of the drowned city. <words>450</words> She had sheltered the flame as best she could; now, only the deep currents knew its fate. <words>469</words>
