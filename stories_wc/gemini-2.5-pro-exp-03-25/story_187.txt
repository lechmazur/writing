Kaelen, the stoic wanderer, arrived just as chalk dust settled. <words>10</words>
The witch's familiar training ground hummed with residual energy, hidden behind a facade that was mesmerizingly bland. <words>26</words>
He'd found this place by following a trail of nightmares, echoes of nascent magic bleeding into the sleeping world. <words>44</words>
Under his arm, he carried a weathered floorboard pried from an abandoned cabin miles away, its grain dark with absorbed secrets. <words>65</words>
His motivation was singular: to archive ritual practices before they faded entirely, a self-appointed chronicler of the arcane. <words>84</words>
The air thickened precisely at the moment a teacher, a woman with eyes like chipped obsidian, wiped the final formula away from a slate board. <words>110</words>
Kaelen stepped forward, his boots crunching softly on the strangely sterile earth of the clearing. <words>126</words>
He knew he would have to impose his presence here, unwelcome as he undoubtedly was. <words>141</words>
"Looking for strays," Kaelen stated, his voice rough but carrying an odd undercurrent, a brash tenderness aimed at the unseen creatures more than the teacher. <words>169</words>
It was one of the necessary lies he carried, simpler than explaining his true quest to preserve their fading ways. <words>189</words>
The teacher turned, her gaze sharp, assessing the intruder and the strange plank he held. <words>205</words>
"We train familiars, not collect lost souls," she replied coolly, her hand hovering near the damp cloth she'd used on the slate. <words>228</words>
Kaelen held up the floorboard slightly. <words>234</words>
"This one remembers," he said, tapping the wood. <words>241</words> "It remembers the binding rites, the old ones." <words>250</words>
He needed access, needed to see the patterns, the gestures, the true forms obscured by time and secrecy. <words>269</words>
His lie about seeking strays was thin, but it was a necessary shield for his deeper purpose. <words>286</words>
The nightmares had led him here, whispers of power coalescing around this hidden nexus. <words>300</words>
He watched the teacher's eyes flicker towards the floorboard, a spark of guarded curiosity igniting. <words>315</words>
Perhaps the wood, saturated with the cabin's lingering enchantments, resonated with this place. <words>330</words>
"The old ways are dangerous," the teacher warned, though her stance relaxed marginally. <words>343</words>
"So is forgetting," Kaelen countered, his tone still gruff, yet hinting at a shared concern beneath the surface. <words>360</words>
He wouldn't force his way, not truly; he needed to impose understanding, not dominance. <words>375</words>
The floorboard felt warm against his palm, a conduit to the past he sought to archive. <words>392</words>
He offered another necessary lie, softening his approach. <words>400</words> "Maybe one of your trainees felt its call, got lost following the echo?" <words>415</words>
The teacher considered him, the bland clearing suddenly charged with unspoken histories. <words>428</words>
Her gaze softened almost imperceptibly, a flicker of that same brash tenderness he projected. <words>443</words>
"Perhaps," she conceded, gesturing towards a barely visible path. <words>453</words> "Look quickly, wanderer, before the next lesson begins." <words>463</words>
Kaelen nodded once, clutching the floorboard tighter, stepping onto the path to witness and remember. <words>479</words>
