Elara, the lonesome minstrel, adjusted her worn synth-lute strap, the morning chill biting even through the thermal weave of her cloak. <words>21</words> Below, the chrome canyons of Neo-Veridia pulsed with the familiar drone of sky-traffic and the impatient shuffling of citizens in endless coffee lines. <words>44</words> Up here, however, atop the Sterling Tower's bizarrely typical rooftop horse stables, a different rhythm held sway. <words>61</words> Steam rose from the flanks of genetically-modified ponies bred for atmospheric endurance, their quiet munching a counterpoint to the city's hum. <words>84</words> Elara wasn't here for the horses, though their gentle presence was a comfort. <words>98</words> Her gaze was fixed upwards, seeking meaning in the shifting canvas of engineered clouds. <words>114</words> It was her inherited burden, this celestial obsession, a rivalry passed down through generations of Sky-Readers. <words>133</words> "The Cumulus formation speaks of reconciliation," she murmured, tracing a shape with a gloved finger. <words>149</words> A harsh, synthesized voice crackled from the comm bead tucked in her ear, "Nonsense, Elara, that's clearly the Stratus of Impending Tariffs, just like Grandfather Kaelen always predicted." <words>179</words> It was Rhys, her unseen cousin, monitoring the same sky-data feed from some sterile observation deck miles away. <words>199</words> They always seemed to bicker, their interpretations clashing like static discharge, continuing a feud neither truly understood but both felt compelled to uphold. <words>228</words> "You only see tariffs because your family *deals* in tariffs," Elara retorted, her voice tight. <words>244</words> "And you only see poetry because you strum that ridiculous lute, clinging to outdated methods," Rhys shot back. <words>263</words> Elara sighed, pulling a small, heavy object from her pocket: a rubber stamp made of some dense, unknown polymer. <words>285</words> Its face was worn smooth, the image it once held utterly unclear, a relic from the originator of their families' cosmic disagreement. <words>311</words> Sometimes she felt the urge to press it onto her observation charts, hoping the faded imprint might reveal the original truth they fought over. <words>337</words> But what truth could a worn stamp hold against the vast, silent cosmos she yearned to read? <words>357</words> She tracked the cloud patterns, noting the subtle shifts in vapor density and light refraction, her primary method for deciphering the universe's quiet messages. <words>385</words> The argument with Rhys faded into background noise, just another part of the mundane enchantment of her existence. <words>405</words> A pony nudged her hand, seeking warmth or perhaps a treat, grounding her momentarily from the celestial squabble. <words>425</words> She offered a faint smile, the silent cosmos reflected in her lonely eyes, still waiting to be truly understood, stamp or no stamp, rivalry or no rivalry. <words>454</words> The coffee lines far below would disperse, the day would unfold, but Elara would remain, watching the clouds, listening for whispers among the stars. <words>481</words>
