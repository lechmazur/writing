Elmsworth adjusted his spectacles, his knuckles white where he gripped the inventory ledger. <words>14</words> This witch's greenhouse, clinging precariously to a windswept hill of listing gravestones, offended his every sensibility with its chaotic blend of decaying herbs and strange glass vials. <words>43</words> He was an uptight scribe, tasked with cataloging the bizarre remnants of a life lived outside the margins of propriety. <words>62</words> Dust motes danced in the slanted afternoon light, illuminating cobwebs that draped over wilting nightshade like macabre bunting. <words>80</words> His gaze snagged on an object incongruously placed beside a pot of skeletal ferns: a peculiar, pear-shaped prototype light bulb, its filament crudely complex, unmistakably from Tesla’s workshop according to the accompanying scorched note. <words>119</words> Near it lay a torn envelope, its seal clearly broken long ago. <words>131</words> Driven by a meticulousness bordering on obsession, Elmsworth carefully scraped a sample from the flap. <words>148</words> He began analyzing the leftover adhesive from the once-sealed envelope, employing a small chemical kit he carried for verifying document authenticity. <words>172</words> Faint traces of pollen, unique to a flower thought extinct for a century, mingled with a residue unknown to his reagents. <words>194</words> It matched a microscopic sample taken from the bulb's brass base. <words>205</words> The witch hadn't just owned the bulb; she had somehow interacted with its creation, or perhaps its power source involved something... organic, something tied to this place of death and tenacious life. <words>241</words> This was the moment when a puzzle piece finally fits, slotting into place with a silent, jarring click within his ordered mind. <words>264</words> A quiet transformation began rippling through him, unsettling the rigid foundations of his worldview. <words>280</words> He felt certainly uncertain, adrift in a sudden sea of possibilities where science and superstition weren't opposing forces but perhaps intertwined threads. <words>306</words> His carefully constructed reality, built on rules and ledgers, felt flimsy against the weight of this revelation. <words>325</words> The witch, dismissed as a hedge-magician, might have been something far more complex, perhaps even a collaborator with the man of electricity. <words>350</words> What other secrets did this chaotic place hold about the nature of understanding itself? <words>365</words> His lifelong motivation had been to impose order, a metaphorical attempt to cradle empathy in arms of steel, protecting delicate truths within rigid frameworks. <words>392</words> But the adhesive, the bulb, the impossible pollen – they spoke of a different kind of truth, one that flowed rather than stood fixed. <words>418</words> A pressure built in his chest, an unfamiliar surge of something wild and vast, until he could no longer contain it. <words>441</words> Elmsworth threw back his head and let out a raw bellow, the sound swallowed by the humid air and the silent judgment of the gravestones outside. <words>467</words> As the echo faded, a strange sense of buried optimism settled within him; the world was infinitely stranger, yes, but perhaps infinitely more wondrous too. <words>494</words>
