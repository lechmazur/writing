The unsteady sentinel leaned against a corroded stanchion in the abandoned space freighter docking bay, the metal groaning under even that slight weight. <words>24</words> Outside the fractured viewport, two planets spiraled towards their final, incandescent embrace, a silent ballet of destruction happening between worlds colliding. <words>46</words> A tremor ran through the deck plates, mirroring the one in the sentinel's own hands. <words>61</words> It wasn't fear, precisely, but a kind of cheerless ecstasy, the grim satisfaction of witnessing the universe confirm its own absurdity. <words>83</words> His purpose here felt increasingly thin: to clear the fog of a misguided prophecy that had led so many to this desolate end point. <words>109</words> A whirring click announced his only companion. <words>117</words> The strange automaton bird landed on a nearby crate, its brass feathers ruffled, its jeweled eyes blinking with unsettling awareness. <words>138</words> It tilted its head, emitting a soft, discordant chirp that felt almost mocking. <words>151</words> The sentinel ignored it, focusing instead on the pile of confetti-like paper fragments scattered across a dusty console. <words>171</words> For weeks, he had been painstakingly working by reassembling shredded letters, salvaged from the captain's quarters before the final evacuation. <words>194</words> The prophecy, they called it; a cruel joke, he now suspected. <words>206</words> The automaton bird hopped closer, nudging a sliver of paper with its beak, its movements jerky, almost coyly furious, as if annoyed by the sentinel's slow progress yet bound to observe. <words>241</words> He carefully picked up the piece the bird had indicated, his breath catching. <words>255</words> It fit perfectly into the gap he’d been staring at for an hour. <words>269</words> Slowly, agonizingly, the true message emerged from the fragmented script, not a prophecy of salvation, but a calculated lure. <words>291</words> They hadn't been guided here to escape the collision; they'd been herded here to be obliterated, a sacrifice engineered by an unknown hand. <words>318</words> The ambush of fate wasn't random; it was meticulously planned. <words>330</words> A hollow laugh escaped the sentinel, dry and brittle in the vast emptiness of the bay. <words>347</words> The cheerless ecstasy surged – the awful clarity was almost a relief. <words>360</words> He looked at the colliding planets, now visibly merging, fire blooming across their surfaces. <words>376</words> He activated the freighter's last functional comms unit, its static hiss a lonely sound. <words>392</words> "To any fleet remnants," he began, his voice steadier now, infused with the cold certainty of doom. <words>410</words> "The designated sanctuary zone is compromised... a trap." <words>419</words> He paused, watching the automaton bird preen a metallic feather. <words>430</words> "I recommend immediate dispersal... scatter and survive if you can." <words>442</words> He cut the transmission, the silence rushing back in, heavier than before. <words>455</words> The bird clicked softly, its jeweled eyes reflecting the planetary death throes. <words>468</words> The sentinel closed his eyes, waiting for the freighter to be consumed. <words>481</words>
