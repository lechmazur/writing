Kaelen, a lurking assassin cloaked in the asteroid’s reflected, borrowed starlight, watched the orbital transport dock. <words>17</words> This baroque asteroid, all gilded buttresses and crumbling obsidian filigree, was a cage pretending to be art. <words>33</words> His target, a philosopher-artist known for pronouncements that felt superficially profound, was aboard. <words>46</words> Kaelen adjusted the focus on his modified scope, its primary optic a paint-splattered camera lens scavenged from a derelict gallery ship. <words>67</words> The vibrant streaks across the glass distorted the incoming light, a constant reminder of a past failure he refused to repeat. <words>87</words> His mission was simple, yet his motivation felt impossibly fragile: to cradle the dawn in trembling hands, a dawn only possible after this final darkness. <words>114</words> He craved the quiet peace that sunrise represented, a stark contrast to his current existence. <words>130</words> He tracked the disembarking passengers via the pattern of a spider's web after rain, each connection point a potential intercept, shimmering with deadly possibility. <words>157</words> The intricate network of gantries and shadowed alcoves mirrored the silken trap glistening in his mind's eye. <words>176</words> This whole station, this whole life, felt like the unforgiving road – one misstep and you plunged into the void. <words>197</words> He knew the schedule intimately; his window closed precisely when the bus driver completes the final route, shuttling the last workers back to the asteroid's hollow core. <words>229</words> The target emerged, draped in ostentatious fabrics, already pontificating to a small cluster of admirers about cosmic insignificance. <words>249</words> Kaelen noted the slight tremor in the man's hand as he gestured, a flicker of fear beneath the practiced intellectual facade. <words>271</words> It was always there, the fear, no matter how well hidden. <words>283</words> He followed, melting into the deeper shadows cast by grotesque statuary, his movements fluid, practiced, unseen. <words>301</words> The philosopher spoke of embracing the void, yet clung desperately to the light and the attention it brought. <words>321</words> Kaelen raised his weapon, the paint streaks momentarily aligning with a distant nebula visible through a cracked dome. <words>340</words> He saw the target pause near a poorly maintained fountain, its water pump sputtering erratically. <words>356</words> The final bus hissed as its doors prepared to close across the plaza, its running lights cutting weakly through the gloom. <words>378</words> The driver, a silhouette against the interior glow, glanced out, his shift nearly done. <words>394</words> In that precise moment, understanding the sheer, pathetic irony of the target’s empty words against his own desperate hope for dawn, Kaelen let out a short, sharp laugh. <words>426</words> It was a sound swallowed instantly by the vast, indifferent silence of the baroque asteroid. <words>441</words> Then, he pulled the trigger, the only sound louder than the dying echo of the bus engine fading down the unforgiving road. <words>464</words> His hands, he noted distantly as he slipped away, were already trembling. <words>477</words>
