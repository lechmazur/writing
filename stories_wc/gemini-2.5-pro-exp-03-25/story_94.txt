Elara traced the edge of the sky reflection pool, the cityscape shimmering upside down beneath the water's placid surface. <words>19</words> In this era, after the invention of time travel, even the heavens seemed unsettled, scarred by temporal wakes. <words>36</words> She adjusted one of her amber earrings, the fossilized resin warm against her skin, a relic from a past she sometimes visited but could never truly reinhabit. <words>63</words> As a heartbreak counselor specializing in temporal displacement affairs, she understood the crushing gravity of desires stretched across decades, even centuries. <words>85</words> Her clients came to her shattered, not just by loss, but by the echoes of what might have been, visible only to those attuned to the fractured timelines. <words>114</words> But Elara harbored her own secret ache, a motivation whispered only to the distorted sky in the pool: to proclaim herself free in a cage of illusions, the illusion of linear time itself. <words>148</words> A restlessly curious energy thrummed beneath her composed exterior; she saw the patterns others missed, the subtle shifts in the light. <words>172</words> Today, she wasn't counseling; she was hunting. <words>180</words> Her method was unorthodox, learned from a chrononaut she’d once ‘helped’ through a particularly nasty paradox: by tracking cloud trails, the faint, iridescent contrails left by temporal jumpers, visible only in ionized water like this pool's. <words>224</words> She knelt, her gaze fixed on a specific, shimmering thread unwinding across the reflected cerulean depths. <words>241</words> It was faint, almost gone, the signature of a jump made with reckless abandon, fueled by a desire so potent it warped the local chronofield. <words>269</words> This was the one she’d been waiting for, the one whose trajectory promised an exit, a loophole in the perceived cage. <words>292</words> A flicker of fear warred with exhilaration, the cautious impulsiveness that defined her choices bubbling to the surface. <words>313</words> Was this freedom or just a more elaborate prison? <words>322</words> The gravity of her own desire for escape pulled relentlessly, a force stronger than any client's lament. <words>341</words> She stood abruptly, the movement sharp and decisive. <words>349</words> Reaching into the small satchel at her hip, she pulled out a sleek, silver device, barely larger than her hand. <words>370</words> With a soft, decisive sound, she let the action zip the temporal anchor onto her wrist, activating its low hum. <words>392</words> The amber earrings seemed to pulse faintly, resonating with the anchor and the lingering trail in the pool. <words>412</words> Taking a steadying breath, Elara focused on the endpoint suggested by the fading cloud trail, a point outside the monitored temporal lanes. <words>437</words> One step, then another, towards the pool's edge, towards the shimmering illusion and the dangerous freedom beyond. <words>456</words> The cage might be illusory, but the escape felt terrifyingly real. <words>468</words> She wouldn't just counsel freedom anymore; she would seize it. <words>479</words>
