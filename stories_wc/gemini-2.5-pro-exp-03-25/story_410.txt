Eliphas, hermit extraordinaire and self-proclaimed master of plumbing the unplumbable, sighed, the sound swallowed by the immense cavern cathedral he called home. <words>24</words> Decades alone down here, surrounded by pulsing, phosphorescent flora that cast eerie blue and green light across vaulted rock, had certainly done a number on his conversational skills, not to mention his sanity. <words>60</words> His grand motivation, the Sisyphean task of trying to restore the ancient water systems that fed this subterranean world, felt particularly pointless today. <words>86</words> The impact of isolation wasn't just loneliness; it was the slow erosion of purpose into absurdity. <words>103</words> He fiddled with a corroded valve junction, his only tool a ridiculously blunt scissor he'd found near the old geothermal vents. <words>128</words> "Right tool for the job," he muttered, the despairing humor thick in his voice, "if the job is gently nudging rust." <words>151</words>

Suddenly, a soft *ding* echoed through the cavern, a sound Eliphas hadn't heard in years. <words>167</words> It was the elevator, arriving from gods-knew-where up top, its doors sliding open onto the empty rock floor across the chasm. <words>191</words> Perfect timing, naturally, just as the main aqueduct regulator had seized again. <words>205</words> He squinted at the vacant lift car, a fresh wave of bleak amusement washing over him. <words>222</words> "Expecting someone?" he asked the glowing moss clinging to the walls. <words>234</words> The moss did not reply, though it pulsed a little brighter, as if sharing the joke. <words>250</words>

Right, the regulator. <words>254</words> His astute mind, sharpened by endless solitude and observation, recalled the peculiar sensitivity of the primary bio-luminescent node controlling the flow. <words>279</words> Cutting wouldn't work, not with these dull blades, but maybe... yes. <words>291</words> He needed to amplify the node's energy signature to kickstart the water flow. <words>306</words> His method, developed through lonely, desperate experimentation, was unorthodox to say the least. <words>321</words> He rummaged in his satchel and pulled out a carefully preserved, utterly stale crust of bread. <words>339</words> Closing his eyes, Eliphas focused, concentrating with all his might on the memory, the pure, unadulterated *scent* of a fresh loaf of bread â€“ warm, yeasty, life-affirming. <words>368</words> He held the crust near the largest pulsating fungus, using the blunt scissor not to cut, but to gently angle the bread, directing his focused olfactory memory towards the node's core. <words>401</words>

It was strangely effective. <words>406</words> The phosphorescent flora around the regulator flared, intensifying its glow tenfold as if responding directly to the phantom aroma. <words>426</words> A deep thrum resonated through the stone, and the trickle of water in the nearby channel swelled to a steady, gurgling flow. <words>450</words> Eliphas opened his eyes, watching the water cascade down towards the lower levels. <words>464</words> He glanced back at the empty, waiting elevator, then at the crust in his hand. <words>480</words> "Maybe next time," he chuckled darkly, "it'll be a phantom roast chicken." <words>494</words>
