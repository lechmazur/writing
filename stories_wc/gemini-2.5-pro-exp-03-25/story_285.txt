Kaelen shifted his weight, the worn leather of his sword belt creaking in the frozen air, a sound swallowed by the vastness of the frigid tundra orchard. <words>26</words> Steam plumed from scattered geothermal vents, momentarily thawing the ice-crusted branches of skeletal fruit trees, a stark reminder of the life that struggled here. <words>52</words> An ephemeral rancor, thin as hoarfrost, clung to the place, a bitterness for warmth lost and connections severed. <words>72</words> He clutched the hilt of his blade, knuckles white, yet his spirit remained stubbornly hesitant. <words>88</words> His motivation burned cold and clear: to restore the traditional systems that once thrived in balance, before the severing. <words>108</words> But Kaelen was naturally awkward, his movements jerky, his resolve prone to stumbling like his feet on the uneven, icy ground. <words>131</words>

Word had reached him through the swirling snows: the final piece of evidence, a testament to the old ways, had been filed away in the archives of the Frost Lords, dismissed as irrelevant. <words>166</words> That piece was symbolized, for Kaelen, by the blank postcard tucked inside his worn tunic â€“ a potential message never sent, a connection waiting to be remade. <words>195</words> Filing it away meant accepting the divide, letting the warmth fade entirely from this fractured world. <words>213</words> He couldn't allow that; the duty to attempt bridging worlds, however clumsy his efforts, fell to him. <words>233</words>

He watched the vents, observing the subtle energy shifts, the way heat pulsed and life clung precariously. <words>252</words> The elders spoke of the ancient method, the way spirits once flowed between realms, ensuring balance. <words>271</words> They described it strangely: by the life of hermit crabs moving shells, a slow, deliberate exchange, seeking a better fit, a necessary transition. <words>299</words> Kaelen understood it not as literal crustaceans, but as a principle of finding passage, of energies seeking new vessels or pathways when old ones became uninhabitable. <words>331</words> The vents were the thin places, the potential openings between the frozen waste and the warmth that was lost. <words>352</words>

Now, with the last official acknowledgment of the old ways discarded, the time was forced upon him. <words>371</words> Taking a shaky breath that frosted instantly, Kaelen drew his sword, not with aggression, but with ritualistic intent. <words>393</words> He had to emerge from his shell of fear and self-doubt. <words>406</words> Awkwardly, he traced ancient symbols in the air above the largest vent, the blade humming faintly. <words>425</words> He focused on the postcard, on the void it represented, pouring his desperate hope, his ephemeral rancor, and the weight of tradition into the shimmering heat haze. <words>456</words> A flicker, a pulse of warmth stronger than before, answered him, a tentative tendril reaching across the divide, seeking a new shell. <words>480</words> The bridging had begun, fragile and uncertain, much like the swordsman himself. <words>494</words>
