Pip whistled a tuneless, cheerful dirge, his fingers dancing near a merchant's bulging coin purse in the time-worn marketplace. <words>19</words> Above, sand streamed relentlessly down the colossal hourglass walls, a constant reminder that everything here was borrowed time. <words>37</words> He felt the familiar blithe discontent bubble up; another day, another hustle in a world literally slipping away. <words>55</words> His other hand worried the useless, broken pencil sharpener in his pocket, its plastic casing cracked like a forgotten promise. <words>75</words> He was hopeful, ridiculously so, that today would be different, that the gnawing secret wouldn't feel quite so heavy. <words>96</words> It was nearing the hour when the children's chalk lines on the lower concourse finally blurred into the worn flagstones, a daily erasure he dreaded. <words>123</words> He needed to share it, this truth that seared his soul, needed someone else to witness the terrible depths of devotion he'd stumbled into. <words>148</words> A garish stall nearby blared crackling music, advertising 'Karaoke Confessions'. <words>159</words> Suddenly, a figure bumped him hard â€“ Elara, with eyes as sharp as her tongue and a reputation for being tastefully offensive. <words>182</words> "Watch it, sand-scuffler," she snapped, though a flicker of something else crossed her face. <words>197</words> "Lost in thought, star-gazer?" Pip retorted, pocketing the sharpener again, his earlier target forgotten. <words>213</words> "Just contemplating the existential dread of it all," she said, gesturing vaguely at the descending sand. <words>230</words> "Or maybe just the awful music," Pip grinned, an idea sparking. <words>242</words> "Bet we could do better," Elara challenged, her eyes gleaming. <words>253</words> Before logic could intervene, they were stumbling towards the karaoke stall, a spontaneous duet forming in the chaotic air. <words>274</words> They grabbed the mics, choosing a mournful ballad that somehow fit the decaying grandeur. <words>289</words> As they sang, voices surprisingly harmonious, Pip felt the weight inside him shift, the secret aching to break free. <words>309</words> He looked at Elara, saw past the abrasive wit to something unexpectedly steady. <words>323</words> Mid-verse, Pip faltered, the words catching in his throat. <words>333</words> "I saw him," Pip whispered into the mic, the music momentarily covering his words from the wider market, "I saw Old Man Hemlock *materialize* gold from pure sand, Elara, enough to stop the hourglass." <words>369</words> The secret hung between them, heavy and unbelievable, a testament to Hemlock's desperate, hidden devotion to this dying place. <words>389</words> Elara stared, her usual cynicism momentarily wiped away, understanding dawning in her eyes. <words>403</words> The song ended, leaving only the hiss of falling sand and the shared, searing knowledge. <words>419</words> Pip felt lighter, though the hope felt fragile, like the fading chalk lines below. <words>435</words> Sharing the burden, even through a bizarre karaoke confession, was its own form of devotion. <words>451</words> Perhaps, just perhaps, knowing wasn't the end, but a beginning. <words>463</words> Elara gave a curt, almost imperceptible nod, a silent promise in the face of oblivion. <words>479</words>
