Kaelen, who still felt more like a scrappy tavern-hand than the custodian of this absurdity, polished the glass wall of the vacuum chamber garden. <words>24</words> Outside, dust motes danced in reverse, sucked back towards unseen origins as the sands of time flowed backward, a cosmic joke he’d stopped finding funny ages ago. <words>54</words> Inside, preserved flora glowed unnaturally, silent witnesses to temporal decay unwinding. <words>67</words> His gaze drifted to the corner where his meager collection of seashells lay, each one fractured, mirroring the splintered moments spooling back around him. <words>93</words> Just bits of calcium carbonate, really, but they were anchors, or maybe just prettier debris than most. <words>111</words> "Right then, showtime," he muttered, the flippant solemnity coating his words like grime on old bottles. <words>129</words> The inescapable callings had been louder lately, a psychic hum demanding attention, urging him towards the garden's strangest feature. <words>152</words> His motivation wasn't escape, not really; it was the desperate need to catapult imagination beyond known realms, to see *outside* this relentless rewind. <words>179</words> He crossed the sterile floor to the dried-up riverbed embedded in the garden's base, a scar of impossible geology. <words>202</words> Within the cracked earth lay the fossilized footprints of some long-extinct, multi-legged creature, each depression pulsing faintly with errant chronitons. <words>228</words> The method was precise, yet maddeningly vague: he had to walk through the fossilized footprints in a dried-up riverbed, but the sequence needed to be unique each time. <words>261</words> He had to randomize his path, leaning into his own predictably unpredictable nature, hoping the universe appreciated the irony. <words>285</words> Taking a breath that felt like inhaling yesterday, Kaelen stepped onto the first print, then the third, then skipped to the eighth, letting instinct randomize his choices. <words>317</words> The airless space shimmered, the backward flow stuttering around his feet like a scratched record. <words>334</words> Each footprint he touched sent jolts up his legs, not of pain, but of disjointed sensation – the taste of ozone, the smell of forgotten sunlight, the sound of forward-flowing water. <words>368</words> He stumbled on, a frantic dance against the reversed tide, his mind stretching, fraying, reaching. <words>386</words> Images flashed behind his eyes: stars being born, not dying; futures blooming, not receding; possibilities branching instead of collapsing. <words>409</words> It wasn't a clear vision, more like glimpsing infinity through a cracked keyhole, but it was *beyond*. <words>429</words> He completed the sequence, collapsing back onto the sterile floor, gasping vacuum that wasn't there. <words>446</words> The garden settled, the backward flow smoothing out, the footprints dimming. <words>459</words> He glanced at the broken seashells, fragments of a past that perhaps never was, or was yet to be undone. <words>481</words> Another day, another temporal absurdity navigated with the grace of a falling brick, just as expected. <words>499</words>
