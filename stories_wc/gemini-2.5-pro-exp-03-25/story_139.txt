Brother Theron awoke, the phantom melody still echoing, in the heartbeat after a dream returns. <words>15</words> He sat rigidly upright in the swaying aerial gondola, the metallic groan of the cables a counterpoint to the silence within him. <words>35</words> Outside, jagged peaks clawed at a sky bruised with dawn, a vista of cautious enchantment that did little to soothe his stubborn spirit. <words>57</words> His reflection, superimposed on the misted window, seemed to smirk – that dark reflection he was determined to finally outsmart. <words>78</words> This journey, this ascent into the cold mountain air, was the culmination of years spent harvesting the past. <words>96</words> Clutched in his lap was a worn wooden case, its contents the key. <words>109</words> Inside lay the antique flute, a visually unappealing instrument scarred and darkened by time, yet holding the truth he sought. <words>130</words> Affixed crookedly to the case's underside was a creased shipping label, its faded ink hinting at a journey long ago completed, a transaction Theron needed to unravel. <words>159</words> He had sworn to avenge his master, whose disappearance was tied to this very flute, stolen years prior by one who left only whispers and shadows. <words>186</words> The dream always brought back the master's final, unheard plea, fueling Theron's resolve. <words>199</words> Ignoring the gondola's lurch, Theron carefully lifted the flute, its surface rough beneath his calloused fingers. <words>218</words> His focus narrowed not on the finger holes or the mouthpiece, but on a series of minute indentations near the base. <words>240</words> These were the faint, yet distinct, tooth marks his master had once mentioned, left by the thief during a struggle. <words>261</words> Theron believed analyzing these tooth marks on the antique flute was the only path left. <words>277</words> He produced a small, specialized lens and a set of delicate probes, tools honed for this singular purpose. <words>297</words> For years, he had studied dental records, obscure texts on bite patterns, anything that might give meaning to these tiny wounds on wood. <words>323</words> The gondola swung gently, bathed now in the tentative gold of sunrise, the world outside breathtaking, unnoticed. <words>341</words> He measured the spacing, the depth, the unique curvature of each mark, cross-referencing them with the fragmented records he’d painstakingly gathered, fragments gleaned from monastery archives and forgotten ledgers hinted at by the shipping label's origin point. <words>384</words> A flicker of recognition sparked in his eyes as a specific anomaly in the pattern matched – a rare dental modification practiced only by a secluded order residing on the farthest peak, the gondola's destination. <words>423</words> The dark reflection in the glass seemed less confident now, more wary. <words>435</words> Theron allowed himself a grim, tight smile; the past was harvested, the path to avenge illuminated. <words>452</words> He would outsmart not just his reflection, but the thief who thought himself hidden by time and altitude. <words>471</words> The gondola reached the summit station, its doors sighing open to the biting wind and the final stage of his quest. <words>492</words> </words>
