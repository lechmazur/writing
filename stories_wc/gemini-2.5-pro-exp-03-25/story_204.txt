Elara, a professional cuddler by trade, stood stiffly within the cavernous, abandoned spaceport hangar, the silence amplifying her discomfort. <words>19</words> This place, steeped in the metallic tang of decay and forgotten journeys, represented everything she’d been taught to distrust. <words>37</words> Her motivation was simple yet profound: to overcome a deep-seated prejudice against the Off-Worlders, the very people this reclaimed hangar was meant to honor tonight. <words>63</words> It felt like an ancient novelty, this gathering – ghosts of stellar ambition mingling with the scent of fresh paint and nervous anticipation. <words>85</words> The hush before the acceptance speech began was thick, almost viscous, pressing in on the unusually usual crowd gathered beneath rusting gantries. <words>108</words> They looked like anyone, yet carried the subtle weight of stars in their posture. <words>123</words> Elara clutched the smooth, cool metal object in her pocket, a phantom train ticket punch she’d found nestled amongst shattered plasteel near the entrance. <words>148</words> It wasn't real, of course, more like a memory fragment solidified, perhaps from the old atmospheric railway that once serviced this terminal. <words>173</words> Its ghostly click seemed to echo the unspoken rules of her own profession – the boundaries, the assumed narratives, the careful distance maintained even in closeness. <words>199</words> She wouldn't be here at all if not for a chance encounter at a farmer's market weeks ago, amidst stalls overflowing with Terran produce. <words>225</words> He’d been buying sun-dried tomatoes, his eyes reflecting the same weary kindness she saw in many clients, yet marked by that Off-Worlder stillness she’d always misinterpreted as coldness. <words>258</words> He spoke of this project, this reclamation, this speech he was to give, inviting her not as a client, but as a witness. <words>283</words> Her prejudice, ingrained since childhood tales of aloof star-farers, felt brittle now, ready to crumble like the corroded panels overhead. <words>306</words> The hangar itself was a testament to time's relentless action; dust motes danced in the beams of temporary floodlights, illuminating patches where vibrant murals had surrendered to creeping oxidation. <words>339</words> The air tasted of ozone and history. <words>346</words> She ran a thumb over the phantom punch, its imagined mechanism a counterpoint to her own tightly wound nerves. <words>365</words> Could she truly punch a hole through years of learned aversion? <words>377</words> The unspoken rules of her past demanded she leave, demanded she maintain the separation. <words>394</words> Yet, the quiet dignity of the waiting crowd, the earnestness in the man's market-day invitation, held her rooted. <words>415</words> A single spotlight flared, hitting the makeshift podium. <words>423</words> The hush deepened, pregnant with possibility. <words>430</words> Elara took a slow breath, the scent of decay mingling strangely with hope, and decided, just for tonight, to break her own rules. <words>454</words> The speech was about to begin. <words>461</words> </story>
