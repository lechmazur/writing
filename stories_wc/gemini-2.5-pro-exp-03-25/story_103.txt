Sir Kaelen, a weatherbeaten knight whose armor bore the salt-scars of the sea as much as the dents of battle, stared into the polished back of a pewter plate, the only mirror afforded him in this lighthouse prison. <words>35</words> The tower stood defiantly on a jagged reef, waves crashing endlessly below like applause for his solitude. <words>51</words> Within the mirrored reflection, however, it wasn't the damp stone walls he saw, but a sun-drenched courtyard from years long past. <words>73</words> There, standing before two ornate doors, his younger self wrestled with one of life's truly impossible choices: duty or love, kingdom or heart. <words>98</words> Kaelen watched now, his present misery a stark contrast to the vibrant agony playing out in the pewter. <words>117</words> His motivation was singular, desperate: to finally hush the final cry of regret that echoed in his soul louder than the gulls outside. <words>141</words> In the reflection, scattered near his younger self's feet, lay a set of seemingly random items: a dropped white glove, three fallen crimson petals, and a discarded scroll tied with blue ribbon. <words>174</words> Kaelen hadn't noticed them then, blinded by the weight of his decision, but now, isolated with only memory, he saw the pattern they formed – an arrow pointing towards the left door. <words>209</words> Affixed to that very door, gleaming unnaturally bright in the mirrored past, was a heavy brass door knocker shaped like a lion's head, its mouth open in a silent roar. <words>241</words> That was the door he hadn't chosen, the path leading away from the crown and towards a simpler life he’d yearned for but forsaken. <words>268</words> A feeling washed over the old knight, a sensation so sharp it was almost physical – a joyful agony, the remembered sweetness of the 'what if' pierced by the sharp reality of his stone cage. <words>305</words> He saw the hope in his younger self's eyes, the terrible burden, and felt a strange, reluctant empathy bloom in his chest. <words>330</words> It was a grudgingly sweet sensation, like finding a single wildflower pushing through the cracks of his prison floor. <words>352</words> He had spent years cursing that moment, that choice, that younger, foolish man reflected before him. <words>370</words> But seeing the pattern now, the glove, the petals, the scroll, the silent roar of the brass door knocker – it wasn't a condemnation, but perhaps a map of his own heart's buried desire. <words>406</words> He needed to appreciate the depth of that sacrifice, the very real love he had traded for a tarnished crown and this lonely tower. <words>434</words> As he focused, truly letting himself appreciate the terrible beauty of that lost possibility, the reflection shimmered. <words>453</words> The younger Kaelen faded, the courtyard dissolved, leaving only the old knight staring back from the pewter, the cry of regret within him finally, blessedly, beginning to hush. <words>483</words> The agony remained, yes, but the joy, however grudging, now shared its space. <words>498</words>
