Kaelen, a reaver whose heart was a locked vault, sat hunched on a bench warped by time and strange fungi in the kaleidoscope park. <words>24</words> Shards of emerald and violet light fractured across their scarred knuckles as the park’s mirrored flora spun lazily. <words>42</words> The place was charmingly grotesque, like a beautiful wound. <words>51</words> Kaelen unfolded a crumpled piece of paper, smoothing out the crayon marks of a child’s drawing – a lopsided sun beaming over a stick figure. <words>78</words> Their own, from a time before. <words>85</words> A time before the first lie is told, the one where you pretend the emptiness doesn't echo. <words>103</words> This park, this drawing, they were anchors to a self Kaelen barely acknowledged. <words>116</words> The familiar, bitter ache started, the one that whispered of generational patterns, of fathers who took and sons who followed. <words>138</words> Kaelen pulled a worn notebook from their coat, its margins already dense with ink. <words>153</words> It was how they chose to nag, not others, but the ghost of hope still flickering within. <words>171</words> *“Fool,”* Kaelen scrawled beside a sketch of a shattered moon, *“Still dreaming skyward, are we?”* <words>188</words> The poems were crude, jagged things, dripping with a mocking affection for the part of themself that still yearned. <words>209</words> That part stupidly longed to taste the stars in a single kiss, an impossible desire for someone who dealt in wreckage, not wonder. <words>235</words> It was a vulnerability inherited, perhaps, like the sharp line of their jaw or the way their silence could cut. <words>257</words> *“Stars burn, little spark,”* another marginalia jabbed, *“Reach too high, you only ash.”* <words>273</words> Yet, the memory tied to the drawing persisted – not a specific event, but the *feeling* of unfiltered sunlight, of believing stick figures could hold hands forever. <words>304</words> It was the antithesis of the reaver’s life, a constant, quiet accusation. <words>317</words> The kaleidoscope park shifted, casting long, distorted shadows that danced like accusations. <words>330</words> Kaelen traced the crayon sun with a calloused finger. <words>340</words> The urge to find *someone*, anyone, and steal that impossible kiss, that taste of starlight, surged with painful intensity. <words>362</words> It felt like defiance against the grim legacy etched into their bones. <words>375</words> *“One touch,”* the poem beneath their thumb seemed to sneer, *“And the pattern breaks or binds you tighter.”* <words>394</words> Kaelen looked up, eyes scanning the shifting, grotesque beauty of the park, searching for a face, a target, a chance. <words>416</words> The notebook remained open, the self-directed nagging hanging in the fractured air. <words>429</words> For now, in this moment before truth curdled into the necessary lies of survival, the closed-off reaver only watched, caught between the pull of the stars and the gravity of their past. <words>464</words> They folded the drawing carefully, tucking it away like a secret wound, the scrawled poems a bitter lullaby against the silence. <words>487</words> The kiss remained untasted, the stars distant. <words>495</words>
