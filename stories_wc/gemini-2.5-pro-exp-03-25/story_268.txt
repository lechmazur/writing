Kaelen settled onto the cracked vinyl bench in the abandoned waiting area, the air thick with dust and the ghosts of hurried departures. <words>23</words> His laptop glowed, initiating the first of the day's mandatory virtual calls, a necessary charade. <words>38</words> Propped against a peeling wall advertisement for a long-defunct airline stood the antique funhouse mirror, its warped glass reflecting the decay in grotesque waves. <words>65</words> This was his training ground, his sanctuary of screaming silence amidst the digital noise. <words>79</words> He sought mastery of the Silent Step, an ancient art of perception and movement lost after the last great conflict. <words>100</words> The price of war wasn't just in lives lost, but in skills forgotten, truths obscured. <words>116</words> His fingers worried a plain wooden bead, its smooth surface a stark contrast to the grimy surroundings and the tension coiling in his gut. <words>141</words> On screen, the face of Director Thorne appeared, demanding updates on resource allocation Kaelen barely cared about. <words>161</words> "Progress is steady, Director," Kaelen began, carefully modulating his voice to flatter the man's ego, a necessary unpleasantness. <words>181</words> He needed Thorne unsuspecting, compliant. <words>186</words> While speaking, Kaelen's eyes never left the funhouse mirror, tracking the subtle distortions that rippled across its surface whenever someone moved unseen nearby. <words>215</words> It was a technique derived from the Silent Step, interpreting warped light like a language. <words>231</words> He fumbled slightly with his stylus, an artfully clumsy gesture designed to lower Thorne's guard, making him seem preoccupied and harmless. <words>255</words> "Just ensuring the projections are accurate," Kaelen mumbled, feigning concentration on the shared spreadsheet. <words>271</words> The bead rolled between his thumb and forefinger, a grounding rhythm against the Director's drone. <words>287</words> Thorne lectured about efficiency, oblivious to the real work happening just outside the camera's frame. <words>304</words> Then, Kaelen saw it: a distinct shimmer near the boarded-up ticket counter reflected in the mirror's upper curve. <words>326</words> It wasn't random dust; it was the specific energy signature he'd been hunting, a residual echo left by his target. <words>348</words> He had to flatter Thorne a bit more, keep him talking just long enough to pinpoint the distortion's origin point in the reflection's twisted geography. <words>376</words> "Your insights are invaluable, Director; they clarify the path forward considerably," Kaelen offered, the false praise tasting like ash. <words>399</words> The distortion stabilized, mapping a route through the adjacent derelict concourse. <words>411</words> Thorne finally signed off, leaving Kaelen alone once more in the vast, screaming silence of the waiting area. <words>431</words> The laptop screen went dark, plunging the space into deeper shadow, broken only by the mirror's distorted gleam. <words>451</words> He pocketed the plain wooden bead, the ancient art demanding focus now, the hunt truly beginning. <words>469</words> The price of war echoed in the emptiness, demanding the justice only a subdued vigilante could deliver. <words>487</words>
