The jolt back into his physical self was violent, leaving the phantom scent of ozone and distant screams clinging to his awareness. <words>21</words> His heart hammered against his ribs, a frantic drumbeat against the sudden, terrifying silence atop the abandoned carnival roller coaster track. <words>41</words> The revelation, received seconds ago while his spirit soared miles away, was stark: they knew where his body lay hidden. <words>61</words> He was a secret astral projector, a whisper in the ethereal winds, but someone had finally traced the thread back to its source. <words>84</words> Panic flared, hot and sharp, but years of clandestine existence had forged it into something manageable, a tool rather than a master. <words>107</words> His movements took on a practiced spontaneity, honed reflexes kicking in before conscious thought fully caught up. <words>126</words> Survival wasn't just about the spirit; it was about preserving the anchor, the flesh that allowed the journey. <words>145</words> His motivation was absolute: to preserve survival skills, both the esoteric and the brutally physical, skills useless if he was captured. <words>168</words> His fingers, already moving, closed around the cool weight of the antique brass key tucked into his worn jacket lining. <words>189</words> It wasn't just metal; it was the promise of passage, a specific escape route planned long ago for just this contingency. <words>212</words> He had to flee. <words>216</words> The late afternoon sun cast long, skeletal shadows from the rusting coaster supports across the warped wooden walkway. <words>236</words> Ignoring the treacherous gaps and decaying planks underfoot through sheer familiarity, he began moving, his escape method precise: tracking sun shadows. <words>261</words> He kept to the deepest pools of darkness, his silhouette merging with the structure's own, making him a fleeting ghost even in the physical realm. <words>287</words> Each step was placed with calculated speed, minimizing noise, maximizing cover provided by the shifting lines of light and dark. <words>311</words> A pang hit him â€“ the image from his projection, the frightened face of the informant he'd been observing, the one whose plight had inadvertently led his hunters here. <words>342</words> His unyielding compassion urged him to go back, to help, but it was a feeling that was sometimes always a dangerous luxury. <words>366</words> Helping them later required surviving now. <words>373</words> Reaching a corroded maintenance ladder hidden beneath a loose panel, he used the antique brass key, the lock groaning in protest before clicking open. <words>400</words> He slipped into the shadowed underbelly of the decaying giant, pulling the panel shut just as the crunch of gravel sounded from the base of the track far below. <words>431</words> The chase was on, but for now, the shadows and his skills held. <words>445</words>
