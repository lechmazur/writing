He called himself Alaric, though the title of king felt like a phantom limb upon his homeless frame. <17> His kingdom now was this sandstone labyrinth, an endless knot of warm rock under a sky perpetually dotted with floating lanterns. <36> Alaric’s sole motivation, the ember that kept him shuffling through the winding passages, was to puzzle out a labyrinth once thought unsolvable. <58> It was said the maze itself was born from a lie, much like the transformative betrayal that had stripped him bare years ago, leaving only wisdom and a peculiar resolve. <86> He carried little, save for a weather-beaten kaleidoscope, its brass tarnished, its glass chips dulled but still capable of fracturing light into fleeting beauty. <111>

His approach to the labyrinth was, by any measure, earnestly frivolous. <122> He believed the maze responded not to brute force or logic alone, but to moments of profound connection witnessed within its walls. <144> Thus, his method involved crashing the sporadic weddings that occurred in the labyrinth’s few open plazas, always timing his arrival during readings of the vows. <171> It was then, amidst declarations of fidelity—a concept now painfully complex to him—that he would act. <189> He learned to extend small, almost invisible packets towards the couple or the guests. <203> These packets contained meticulously crafted confetti, each colour and shape forming a coded message, a proposal not of marriage, but of perspective, of a potential path through the maze. <236> These confetti-coded proposals at random weddings were his attempts to communicate with the labyrinth's elusive consciousness. <254>

One sweltering afternoon, during the reading of particularly heartfelt promises under the soft glow of the lanterns, Alaric felt a tremor beneath his worn sandals. <281> He had just released a shower of sapphire and gold confetti, coded with a query about the labyrinth’s origin point, inspired by a pattern glimpsed through his kaleidoscope that morning. <314> He watched the paper fragments flutter down, a silent, hopeful question offered to the ancient stone. <329> Did the labyrinth hear the sincerity layered beneath the seemingly nonsensical act? <342> Did it recognise the ghost of a king seeking not a throne, but an answer? <358> The tremor faded, leaving only the echo of the spoken vows and the quiet hum of the floating lights. <377>

No wall shifted, no path illuminated itself outright. <386> Yet, Alaric felt a subtle change, a slight easing in the oppressive weight of the maze's impossibility, a complex simplicity in the air. <409> The betrayal had taught him that truth often hid within paradox, that the most serious quests might require the lightest touch. <431> Clutching his kaleidoscope, he turned towards a passage that seemed infinitesimally less daunting than before, ready to prepare his next coded offering. <454> His earnest frivolity was his map; the unsolvable labyrinth, his home and his challenge. <470> The lanterns drifted, silent witnesses to the philosopher-king’s lonely, intricate dance with the maze born of deceit. <489>
