The insomniac poet, Elias, rarely found solace, least of all in sleep. <words>12</words> His refuge was the building's haunted attic, a space reflecting his own fractured mind: meticulously messy, crammed with forgotten furniture draped in dust sheets and his own carefully cataloged botanical samples lining warped shelves. <words>49</words> Jars of dried roots and pressed flowers stood sentinel beside notebooks overflowing with half-finished stanzas, an empty abundance of words mirroring his waking hours. <words>76</words> He gathered these specimens obsessively, driven by a peculiar motivation: to discover the power of non-violence by intimately understanding the potential for harm held within the natural world. <words>109</words> But the attic offered more than quiet contemplation lately; it breathed warnings in whispers, faint, sibilant sounds that seemed to emanate from the very dust motes dancing in the weak light. <words>143</words> These spectral voices spoke of consequence, of an old imbalance tied somehow to the plants he collected, particularly those gathered from liminal spaces. <words>169</words> The whispers seemed loudest in the fleeting mental gaps he experienced between subway stops, those jarring moments of transit where the city's rhythm faltered and the attic's chill reached him even underground. <words>205</words> A desperate need grew within him: to eliminate the source of this dread, not through confrontation, but through understanding and release. <words>229</words> His chosen method was peculiar, fueled by sleeplessness and cheap alcohol at infrequent social gatherings. <words>247</words> Elias would eliminate his fear via drunken confessions at after-parties, cornering fellow writers or hangers-on amidst the stale cigarette smoke and intellectual posturing. <words>275</words> "The attic," he'd slur, clutching a wilting stem pilfered from a vase, "it remembers things through the plants." <words>296</words> He confessed the warnings in whispers, described the chilling sentience he felt radiating from a particular nightshade sample, his voice thick with exhaustion and wine. <words>326</words> "It wants something," he’d insist, "a restoration." <words>335</words> Most listeners edged away, unnerved or simply bored by the ramblings of the insomniac poet. <words>352</words> Yet, for Elias, each confession felt like lancing a wound, a non-violent attempt to bleed off the pressure the whispers exerted. <words>376</words> Returning to the meticulously messy haven of the attic, surrounded by his silent botanical samples, the oppressive atmosphere felt fractionally lighter. <words>400</words> The empty abundance of his existence—full of research, poetry fragments, and endless waking hours—seemed less daunting after sharing its spectral secrets. <words>425</words> He hadn't yet grasped the true power of non-violence he sought, but perhaps acknowledging the whispers, giving them voice even in drunken breaths, was its own form of quiet resistance. <words>459</words> The warnings hadn't ceased, but they felt less like a personal haunting and more like an ancient, sorrowful echo he was learning to hear without breaking. <words>488</words>
