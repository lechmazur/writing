Kaito, once a marshal whose name echoed through dusty western towns, now knelt amidst the raked gravel of the ancient Japanese castle's inner garden. <words>24</words> The air, thick with the scent of damp earth and pine, marked the time for seed planting, a ritual he embraced to escape the cycle of violence that had defined his life. <words>56</words> His hands, calloused from gripping a Peacemaker, now gently pressed tiny seeds into the soil, each one a fragile prayer for peace. <words>79</words> He sought refuge here, amidst stone walls weathered by centuries, hoping the ghosts of his past wouldn't cross the vast ocean. <words>103</words> Yet, the world had a way of finding you, its methods probably improbable. <words>116</words> A young monk, bowing low, presented a single, travel-worn envelope addressed to a name Kaito didn't recognize, delivered here by some postal anomaly. <words>142</words> Curiosity, a dangerous ember he thought long extinguished, began to stir within him. <words>156</words> Retreating to the sparse room overlooking the mist-shrouded valley, he retrieved a pair of vintage spectacles he'd found tucked away in a dusty cabinet, their delicate wire frames surprisingly intact. <words>191</words> He needed their aid; the script inside the misplaced letter was faded, written in a language he barely commanded but understood through context and sheer will. <words>223</words> It wasn't meant for him, this confession from a long-dead artisan addressed to a lost love, detailing a life spent gathering broken pieces of pottery, meticulously restoring them into something whole, something beautiful despite the cracks. <words>268</words> The artisan wrote of finding solace not in perfection, but in the patient act of mending, of honouring the fractures. <words>291</words> Kaito lowered the letter, the spectacles resting on the bridge of his nose, feeling a strange resonance, a corroded rapture blooming in his chest. <words>319</words> He too was gathering broken pieces – memories, regrets, shards of a shattered identity – trying to assemble a man who could live with himself. <words>348</words> The artisan's words, intended for another soul across time and circumstance, spoke directly to the former lawman's deepest motivation. <words>372</words> Looking out at the newly planted garden beds, tiny promises pushing towards the sun, he understood. <words>390</words> Escape wasn't about running; it was about rebuilding, finding purpose in the patient mending, even if the scars remained visible. <words>416</words> The misplaced letter, a fragment from another's life, had inadvertently shown him the blueprint for his own restoration. <words>437</words> He carefully folded the brittle paper, placing it beside the vintage spectacles, ready to continue his own quiet work of gathering and mending under the ancient eaves. <words>468</words> The cycle wouldn't break itself, but perhaps, like the kintsugi master, he could make the repairs the most valuable part. <words>492</words>
