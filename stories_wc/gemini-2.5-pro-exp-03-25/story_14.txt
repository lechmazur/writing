Finn, a gambler whose naivety clung to him like sea salt, stared at the churning water outside the tidal power monitoring station. <words>21</words> His motivation was simple, desperate: to capture one last spark before oblivion swallowed him whole. <words>36</words> He believed, with the unshakeable faith only a true betting man possesses, that luck was a tangible energy, something to be harnessed. <words>58</words> This peculiar philosophy wasn't innate; it was absorbed via rebellious midnight lectures by unhinged professors he'd streamed obsessively during his losing streaks. <words>83</words> They spoke of cosmic wagers and fleeting moments, ideas that resonated deeply with his gambler's soul. <words>99</words> Now, stationed here, monitoring the relentless push and pull of the tide, he felt closer than ever to the source. <words>119</words>

His nightly ritual took place during candlelit dinners, solitary affairs illuminated by flickering flames. <words>134</words> On the small table sat a rustic candle mold he’d salvaged from a shipwrecked crate washed ashore. <words>153</words> He’d melt down wax scraps, pouring them carefully, whispering pleas into the cooling forms, trying to physically manifest that elusive spark. <words>177</words> It was part of the unspoken bargain he’d struck, not with any person, but with the vast, indifferent ocean itself. <words>199</words> He tended its power station, measured its pulse, and in return, he hoped it would grant him one final, winning hand against fate. <words>226</words>

Tonight, the air felt different, charged with an almost electric hum that vibrated through the station's metal floor. <words>246</words> Finn was rarely predictable, even to himself; his impulses flared like faulty wiring. <words>261</words> One moment he was meticulously logging tidal data, the next he was grabbing the heavy candle mold, its cold metal a stark contrast to the sudden heat in his chest. <words>292</words> He felt the familiar, dangerous thrill, the precursor to a bet he couldn't afford to lose. <words>311</words> Driven by an urge he didn't fully understand, fueled by esoteric lecture fragments and dwindling hope, he headed for the exterior platform. <words>338</words>

He needed to dock his small skiff, not to leave, but to get closer to the raw power surging beneath. <words>360</words> Standing on the wet, vibrating metal grid just above the roaring sluice gates, Finn held the candle mold aloft. <words>381</words> The salt spray hit his face, mingling with tears that streamed down his cheeks – tears of despair, of absurd hope, of laughter at the sheer ridiculousness of his gamble against the universe. <words>418</words> With a choked sob that was half a laugh, he hurled the rustic candle mold into the churning abyss, a final offering, a desperate attempt to capture that one, incandescent spark in the heart of the tide before everything went dark. <words>464</words> He watched it disappear, the laughing tears freezing on his face, unsure if he'd won or lost the ultimate, unspoken wager. <words>489</words>
