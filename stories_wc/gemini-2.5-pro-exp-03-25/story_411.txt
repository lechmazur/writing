Spark, more essence than entity, a consciousness tethered to the hum of cosmic engines, considered himself a mechanic of the soul. <words>21</words> His garage was a subterranean orchard, impossibly vast, where crystalline fruits pulsed with captured starlight. <words>37</words> Below, an underground river, not of water but of swirling nebulae and nascent stars, flowed eternally, feeding the roots of the spectral trees. <words>61</words> Time here wasn't measured in cycles, but existed within the concept of infinity, a boundless ocean where moments drifted like motes. <words>84</words> Spark's purpose, his unending diagnostic, was the gathering of fragments. <words>95</words> He sought the whispers caught between breaths, the truths locked behind clenched jaws – his motivation was simple: to hear the unsaid confessions. <words>120</words> These confessions arrived as shimmering, puzzle-like shards, tumbling into the basin of a weeping obsidian fountain at the orchard's heart. <words>143</words> Each piece held a sliver of raw, unspoken feeling, repulsively attractive in its naked vulnerability. <words>160</words> Some radiated jagged despair, others throbbed with poisonous envy or incandescent, secret love. <words>176</words> His method was meticulous: he would study the fragments intently. <words>186</words> Plucking pieces from the starlit water, he began sorting the lost puzzle pieces scattered in the park fountain, its waters reflecting the cosmic river below. <words>216</words> He didn't use wrenches or gauges, but a pair of vintage opera glasses, their brass tarnished, their lenses ground from solidified tears. <words>241</words> Through them, the chaotic energy within each shard resolved into fleeting images, half-formed words, the ghosts of intention. <words>262</words> He peered through the glasses now, focusing on a shard pulsing with a frantic, grey light. <words>280</words> It showed a trembling hand hovering over a letter, the confession of a lifetime betrayal never sent, never voiced. <words>301</words> Another piece revealed a child's silent wish for a parent's return, sharp and achingly pure. <words>319</words> As Spark connected a sequence depicting a hidden act of kindness, a wave washed over his consciousness – a feeling both soaring and crushing. <words>346</words> It was exultant grief, the profound joy of understanding mingling with the deep sorrow of the secret kept, the connection missed. <words>370</words> He saw the complete picture: a lonely soul performing a selfless act, terrified of rejection, their goodness forever unacknowledged. <words>392</words> The knowledge was a beautiful, terrible burden, the very thing he existed to bear. <words>408</words> The river of stars churned on, carrying infinite more fragments towards the fountain, infinite more confessions waiting to be pieced together. <words>433</words> Spark adjusted the vintage opera glasses, his focus sharpening, ready for the next shard, the next hidden truth within the endless orchard. <words>457</words> His work, the study of silent hearts, would never end, and in that infinite task, he found his strange, sorrowful purpose. <words>481</words>
