Alistair, a noble forgotten by lineage and time, sat hunched in the acrid air of the spontaneous combustion lab. <words>19</words> The faint chemical tang mingled with the scent of ozone from sparking equipment, a perfume of hollow recklessness he’d grown accustomed to. <words>39</words> His phone buzzed – another text demanding something trivial, rent or perhaps just attention – but he ignored it for now. <words>58</words> Before him lay a chaotic mosaic of faded paper: old opera tickets, train stubs, entry passes to galas long since dissolved into memory. <words>82</words> With meticulous, almost reverent care, he began to fortify his crumbling sense of self through the reassembly of old ticket stubs. <words>104</words> Each tiny piece glued back together was an anchor against the swirling illusions of grandeur and despair that plagued him. <words>124</words> An artificial hummingbird drone, a relic from a more opulent past, hovered near a volatile containment unit, its jeweled wings catching the flickering emergency lights. <words>151</words> Its presence was mysteriously obvious, a beautiful, fragile machine observing the potential for imminent, violent disintegration. <words>170</words> Alistair saw it not as a warning, but as a kindred spirit – artificial, beautiful, and utterly out of place. <words>190</words> He picked up another torn stub, the name of a forgotten theatre barely legible. <words>204</words> This painstaking process, performed between text messages that chipped away at his solitude, was his strange ritual. <words>223</words> His motivation wasn't nostalgia; it was a desperate need to cut through illusions, to prove *something* had been real. <words>243</words> The lab itself, a monument to instability inherited alongside debts and disgrace, hummed with latent energy. <words>260</words> Anyone could see the danger; the cracked beakers, the warning labels peeling from heat exposure, the scorch marks climbing the walls like ivy. <words>285</words> Yet Alistair worked on, his focus absolute in these brief intervals. <words>297</words> His phone buzzed again; he glanced down. <words>305</words> "Are you okay?" the message read, a rare probe from his estranged sister. <words>318</words> For a fleeting second, candor surfaced in the small moment. <words>329</words> He typed back, "Piecing things together in the fireworks factory." <words>339</words> It was true, in its own oblique way, a shard of honesty offered with the same detached carelessness with which he handled the volatile chemicals. <words>364</words> He hit send, the blue light of the screen reflecting in the drone’s unblinking eye. <words>380</words> Then, he returned to his tickets, carefully aligning two halves of a pass to a garden party where he’d first understood his family’s decline. <words>407</words> Fortifying wasn't about building walls, but about finding solid ground in the wreckage, even if that ground was littered with potential explosions. <words>431</words> The drone dipped suddenly, disturbed by a thermal fluctuation near cylinder C, its tiny form a stark, mechanical contrast to the organic threat simmering nearby. <words>458</words> Alistair didn't flinch, merely selected his next fragment, lost again between texts, between memories, between breaths held against the inevitable. <words>481</words>
