Algernon, third Viscount St. Clair and currently designated "Groundskeeper Unit 7," loathed trimming the aggressively geometric hedges surrounding the secret agent workshop. <24> It was dreadfully common work, performed amid the unsettling hum of hidden machinery. <37> While snipping near a ventilation grate, one of the facility's many accidental echo chambers, his unusually perceptive hearing snagged fragments of conversation from the lab below. <63> Voices spoke clinically about Project Meltdown and its primary action: to liquify biological targets with terrifying efficiency. <81> He continued his yard work, secateurs clicking rhythmically, betraying nothing of his unplanned eavesdropping. <96> Then came the mention of the final test subject â€“ a bio-luminescent hummingbird, genetically unique and utterly vulnerable. <114> A wave of silent empathy, sharp and unwelcome, washed over the submissive aristocrat. <128> "Oh, splendid," he thought with earnest flippancy, "dissolving tiny, glowing birds now, are we?" <144> Protecting the creature became an immediate, albeit inconvenient, imperative. <154> Direct intervention was unthinkable for someone whose survival depended on meek compliance. <167> Later, under the guise of hauling compost, Algernon navigated the sterile corridors he usually avoided. <183> His only potential tool was the dull letter opener tucked into his worn gardening boot, a memento from a life of inherited privilege, not espionage. <209> He located the dispersal unit for the liquifying agent, a marvel of chrome and pressurized tubing. <227> His motivation pulsed: save the bird. <234> The letter opener was laughably inadequate for sabotage, blunt and pitted. <247> Yet, his perception, honed by years of observing social nuances rather than technical schematics, noted a tiny, crucial rubber seal near the main nozzle. <272> Working quickly, heart hammering against his ribs in a most undignified manner, he used the blunt edge to meticulously abrade and weaken the O-ring. <299> He didn't sever it, merely introduced a flaw, hoping pressure would do the rest non-catastrophically. <317> He slipped back outside into the grey morning, resuming his raking just as the sun began to breach the horizon. <338> A muffled thud, followed by distinctly annoyed shouts, echoed faintly from the lab building. <353> Success, or at least, a successful complication. <361> Algernon permitted himself the smallest, most fleeting smile as he continued his yard work. <376> The submissive aristocrat had, quite improperly, interfered. <384> The vulnerable creature was safe, for the moment, a fact that brought a bothersome sense of satisfaction. <402> He hated this clandestine nobility; it wrinkled the soul so. <413> Still, the quiet triumph hummed alongside the workshop's machinery, a silent counterpoint to his prescribed obedience. <430> Protecting the small and helpless wasn't protocol, but sometimes empathy simply refused to be subordinate. <447> Espionage, he mused, picking up a fallen leaf, really could be dreadfully messy. <461>
