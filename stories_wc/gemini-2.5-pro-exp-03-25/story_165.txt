Elara, a conjurer whose magic hummed with the softness of moss, knelt in the echoing caverns of the dwarven city. <words>19</words> Her fingers, stained with luminescent dust, traced the jagged edges of a shard from the stained glass butterfly. <words>35</words> This fragile relic was the key, she knew, the focus of her quiet, desperate search for justice. <words>51</words> Years ago, the memory began, sharp and clear as the break of a brittle branch in a silent forest, the moment she’d found the garden shattered and vowed to restore it. <words>83</words> That single, sharp snap in the woods above had somehow echoed the destruction deep below, marking the start of her clandestine mission: to rebuild the forgotten garden the dwarves had erased. <words>116</words>

Working in the flickering gaslight of a disused forge, Elara felt the familiar thrum of joyful terror, a constant companion in these deep places. <words>141</words> The joy came from the act of creation, the slow magic coaxing light and life back into the broken glass; the terror stemmed from the watchful eyes of the dwarves and the weight of their unspoken crime. <words>179</words> The truth of the garden's demise was inscrutably obvious, woven into the city's very stonework – reliefs depicting barren rock where vibrant flora once stood, songs sung with verses missing – yet no dwarf acknowledged it. <words>219</words> Her method was painstaking, deciphering clues gleaned through reversed messages found etched behind loose stones or whispered backwards on stray drafts of tunnel air. <words>246</words> ".ecnatsiser si efil" – *life is resistance* – one message had sung, guiding her hands. <words>260</words>

She gathered the shimmering fragments: sapphire wing-tips, emerald body, ruby antennae. <words>272</words> Each piece resonated with faint echoes of the garden, a symphony waiting to be played anew. <words>289</words> Tonight, she would attempt to reassemble the butterfly completely, channeling her gentle conjuring not into grand illusions, but into meticulous repair. <words>314</words> Sweat beaded on her brow, mixing with the glowing dust, as she focused her will, her breath catching with that specific blend of hope and fear. <words>342</words> The air thickened, light coalescing around the shards held suspended by her magic. <words>356</words> Slowly, painstakingly, edges began to fuse, hairline cracks sealing with threads of pure light. <words>371</words>

A soft click resonated as the final piece slotted into place. <words>383</words> The stained glass butterfly pulsed with a warm, internal luminescence, its colours vibrant and whole once more. <words>400</words> It hovered for a moment, wings beating silently, casting dancing patterns on the rough-hewn walls. <words>416</words> Then, it dipped gracefully and flew towards a seemingly solid section of the cavern wall, phasing through the stone as if it were merely smoke. <words>441</words> Elara gasped, the joyful terror surging – the butterfly wasn't just a symbol, it was the literal key. <words>460</words> Following its path, she pressed her hand against the rock, finding not stone, but the shimmering threshold of the forgotten garden, waiting to be reborn. <words>485</words> Justice, like the garden, began with a single, fragile act of restoration. <words>499</words>
