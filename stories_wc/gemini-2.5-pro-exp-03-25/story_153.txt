Elara, the eternal college student, adjusted the ancient device strapped to her forehead, its single beam cutting through the oppressive gloom. <words>22</words> Her campus was now the sprawling underground city of the mole people, carved deep beneath the crust of a lightless Earth, long after the last star had burned out. <words>53</words> Her perpetual study, immortality, had shifted from abstract theory to a desperate, practical application. <words>69</words> She felt the crushing weight of her gifted burden: endless time in a universe that had already ended. <words>88</words> The coal miner’s headlamp, a relic scavenged from a collapsed shaft near the surface ruins eons ago, was her only reliable light source. <words>114</words> Its faint, unwavering glow felt like detached devotion, mirroring her own approach to existence. <words>130</words> Her motivation remained unchanged across millennia: to become a master of one's own reality, even if that reality was now subterranean darkness. <words>157</words> Tonight, she hoped to finally achieve it. <words>165</words> Spread before her on a smoothed rock were two tattered travel journals, acquired through a swap with a long-vanished entity in a forgotten age. <words>192</words> These journals were the key, detailing a method to digitize consciousness using salvaged technology and the planet's faint geothermal whispers. <words>217</words> The mole people, pale and silent, occasionally passed her alcove, their large, dark eyes reflecting the headlamp’s beam before they disappeared back into the warren's shadows, utterly uninterested. <words>249</words> Elara worked meticulously, connecting fine wires scavenged from defunct machinery between the journals' embedded conductive pages and a crystalline data shard. <words>274</words> The process was painstaking, almost ritualistic, a mundanely glorious act performed under the sole illumination of the miner's lamp. <words>297</words> She was preparing to digitize her entire being, escaping the slow decay of the physical into a realm of pure information outlined within the swapped texts. <words>327</words> This wasn't just survival; it was transcendence, the ultimate control she sought over the terms of her unending existence. <words>349</words> The air thickened with a low hum as the rudimentary matrix, powered by geothermal taps, began to energize. <words>369</words> Elara focused the headlamp's beam onto a specific junction, providing the final catalyst. <words>384</words> Her expression remained placid, a mask of focused calm honed over countless lifetimes. <words>399</words> As the transfer initiated, her physical form shimmered, dissolving into faint streams of light that flowed towards the crystal shard. <words>422</words> The headlamp, dislodged, fell onto the rock table with a soft clatter, its beam now illuminating the empty space where the eternal student had knelt. <words>450</words> It continued to shine, a steadfast, lonely point of light in the vast, silent dark of the mole people's city. <words>473</words> Within the matrix, Elara began constructing her new reality, finally its master. <words>486</words>
