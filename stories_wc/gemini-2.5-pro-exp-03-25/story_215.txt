Elias, the exorcist, felt the lingering chill of his last case even within the sterile walls of the Thorne Institute for Psychic Research. <24> He watched the scheduled afternoon tango lessons through a one-way mirror, a bizarre juxtaposition against the humming psi-dampeners. <43> Though inwardly social, the rhythmic steps felt alien after wrestling with inhuman entities. <57> Dr. Aris Thorne found him there, radiating a smug energy Elias interpreted as coy aggression. <72> "Still contemplating the abyss, Father Michael?" Thorne asked, deliberately using the wrong title. <86> Elias ignored the barb, his gaze fixed on the dancers, feeling profoundly rattled beneath his calm exterior. <103> Thorne slid a vintage postcard across the console beside him – a faded image of a Victorian séance. <122> "A little something to occupy your unique talents," Thorne purred, his smile not reaching his eyes. <139> Elias picked it up; the faint scent of ozone and something older, unsettling, clung to it. <156> On the back, a cryptic riddle was penned in Thorne's precise hand, the first move in a familiar game. <176> This was Thorne's preferred method: guarded disclosures wrapped in intellectual challenges. <188> Elias recognized the pattern, the start of a series of puzzles Thorne often set for consultants he deemed worthy, or perhaps, dangerous, designed to lead towards a hidden room somewhere in the facility. <228> Thorne's motivation was always transparently complex: a relentless drive to entwine science with wonder, even if it meant prodding the darkness Elias fought so hard to contain. <259> Over the next hour, amid the rising tempo of the dance lessons filtering through the walls, Elias began his work. <279> He forced himself to synthesize the postcard's historical context, the riddle's linguistic twists, and the faint psychic residue clinging to the card itself. <304> The first puzzle solution pointed him towards a specific data archive concerning early institutional experiments. <321> Another clue, embedded within a redacted report file, directed him to a defunct electroencephalogram machine gathering dust in a storage annex. <345> He felt Thorne's unseen observation like a weight, a pressure that paradoxically sharpened his focus. <360> The old machine had a sequence of numbers subtly etched beneath its tarnished serial number plate. <377> Returning to the main lab corridor, Elias located an unmarked panel near the observation room where he'd first stood. <399> Inputting the sequence caused a section of the wall to retract silently, revealing a hidden room bathed in low, pulsing light. <422> Inside, strange occult artifacts rested on shelves alongside gleaming, advanced scanning technology. <436> A containment field hummed ominously, holding a swirling vortex of raw energy Elias recognized with a jolt of cold dread. <457> Thorne appeared silently at his shoulder, the coy aggression momentarily eclipsed by triumphant intensity. <472> "We synthesized it, Elias," Thorne whispered, finally using his name, "Pure psychokinetic potential, harvested and stabilized." <490> Elias saw not wonder entwined with science, but terrifying hubris dancing dangerously close to damnation. <506>
