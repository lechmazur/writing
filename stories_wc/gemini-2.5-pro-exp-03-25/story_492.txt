Kael, a notoriously distracted inventor even by Neo-Kyoto's chaotic standards, fiddled with a loose wire on his chrono-gauntlet. <words>19</words> His gaze drifted past the flickering neon signs bleeding onto the grimy cyberpunk city back alley floor. <words>35</words> He was perched precariously halfway up a massive, broken escalator, its metal teeth frozen mid-grind, a perfect symbol of the city's stalled progress. <words>59</words> This standstill offered a rare moment of quiet, though Kael's mind rarely participated in silence. <words>75</words> Strapped to his back, incongruously, was a heavy canvas roll containing antique blacksmith’s tools – hammers, tongs, files, relics in this age of nano-forges. <words>101</words> They felt solid, real, unlike the shimmering digital ghosts he hunted. <words>113</words> His purpose, whispered only to the static humming from overloaded data ports, was to gather fractured illusions scattered across the lower sectors, remnants of broken minds and corrupted dreams, and somehow forge them into something bright. <words>154</words> It was a normally weird ambition, even for him, bordering on technological heresy. <words>168</words> Tonight, the target was the 'Memory Market' server hub hidden deep within the warren of interconnected trails snaking behind the defunct transit line. <words>193</words> Kael sighed, adjusting the weight of the tools; he hated this part, the intrusion, the disruption. <words>211</words> He was always the reluctant catalyst, the one poking the hornet's nest because nobody else saw the honey hidden inside. <words>233</words> His methods often earned him scorn, a kind of ruthless kindness that prioritized the potential outcome over immediate comfort. <words>254</words> Pulling a heavy, scarred hammer from the roll, he didn't approach the obvious access panel glowing faintly under layers of graffiti. <words>277</words> Instead, he located a specific junction box humming with stolen power, a node known only to scavengers and shadow-runners who navigated the city's hidden pathways. <words>308</words> He needed to infiltrate the network physically, bypassing the lethal digital countermeasures protecting the Market's stolen phantoms. <words>329</words> With a grunt, Kael used the hammer's claw to pry open the rusted casing, ignoring the shower of sparks that momentarily blinded him – a typical lapse in focus. <words>358</words> Inside, bundled wires pulsed faintly, the start of the physical trail leading deeper into the city's guts. <words>378</words> He attached a custom-built data leech, its interface cobbled together with parts that looked suspiciously like modified blacksmith's tongs. <words>401</words> The illusions, fragmented and weeping digital tears, began to flow, drawn towards the strange, anachronistic device humming with repurposed energy. <words>425</words> It was messy, brutal work, severing these memories from the parasitic Market, but Kael knew this harsh extraction was the only way to give them a chance at becoming whole again, something luminous salvaged from the wreckage. <words>468</words> He was just the weirdo with the old tools, standing still on a broken escalator, trying to hammer shattered light back together. <words>491</words>
