In the disappearing ink factory, where vats of vanishing liquid shimmered under a midday sun muted by grimy windows, a skeptical minstrel named Gavrin strummed his lute at the hush of an empty mailbox, doubting any soul would hear his irreverent ballads. <words>39</words> The factory, long abandoned, echoed with the hiss of an ancient steam vent, a ghostly whisper of forgotten industry that seemed to mock Gavrin’s presence with irreverent awe. <words>67</words> He’d come here not for song, but to out-scheme an immortal trickster named Veyl, a being of endless deceit who’d swindled Gavrin’s village of their last harvest with promises of eternal bounty. <words>96</words> Gavrin’s motive burned hot—to turn Veyl’s own games against him, proving even immortals could be fooled by mortal wit. <words>116</words> His weapon of choice was an impossibly plausible plan, one so absurd it might just work, fueled by a reckless generosity that Veyl would never suspect. <words>142</words>

Clutched in Gavrin’s calloused hand was a dragon-scale armor scrap, a jagged relic he’d bartered from a mad hermit, its iridescent sheen a taunt to danger itself. <words>170</words> He believed Veyl coveted such rarities, and Gavrin intended to dangle it as bait, a gift too tempting to refuse. <words>191</words> His method was unorthodox: using the factory’s steam vent as a slingshot mechanism, he’d rigged a contraption of taut ropes and pulleys to launch the scrap across the factory floor, straight into Veyl’s greedy hands. <words>228</words> The vent’s hiss powered the device, a wheezing beast of steam that seemed to chuckle at the audacity of it all. <words>250</words> Gavrin’s reckless generosity lay in the act itself—offering a treasure he couldn’t afford to lose, betting everything on Veyl’s arrogance. <words>273</words>

As midday silence deepened, Gavrin spotted Veyl’s shadow slinking through the factory’s rusted beams, a predator drawn by whispers of the dragon-scale. <words>295</words> With a smirk, Gavrin plucked a defiant note on his lute, then released the slingshot, the steam vent hissing as the scrap soared, glinting like a fallen star. <words>323</words> Veyl lunged, catching it midair, his laughter a cruel echo—until he realized the scale was coated in disappearing ink, its value vanishing before his eyes. <words>349</words> Gavrin’s skeptical nature had paid off; he’d doubted Veyl’s omniscience and banked on his greed, out-scheming the trickster with a gift that dissolved into nothing. <words>375</words> The factory seemed to hum with irreverent awe, as if the walls themselves marveled at the mortal’s gall. <words>394</words> Gavrin tipped his hat to the empty mailbox, a silent witness, and walked away, his lute singing of fools and vanished treasures. <words>417</words>
