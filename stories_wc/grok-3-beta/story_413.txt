<story>
In an era before the first creature developed sentience, a listless noble named Lord Evaris wandered the haunted plain, where an endless corn maze sprawled under a sky of perpetual twilight. <words>29</words>
This desolate expanse, whispered to be cursed by forgotten spirits, mirrored Evaris's own hollow heart, burdened by a naively sophisticated air that made him both charming and tragically out of touch. <words>58</words>
Clutched in his pale hands was a faded scarf, a relic of his late mother, its threads worn thin but carrying the weight of unspoken promises. <words>83</words>
Evaris, driven by a vague motivation to discover the power of intention, believed that somewhere in this labyrinth lay an answer to his aimless existence. <words>108</words>
His velvet cloak dragged through the dust as he roamed, the cornstalks whispering with ironic awe, as if mocking his quest while marveling at his persistence. <words>134</words>
Days bled into nights, or so he assumed in this timeless void, until an unexpected invitation slipped through the maze—a parchment caught in the stalks, scrawled with an urgent summons to a spontaneous event at the maze's heart. <words>171</words>
Intrigued, Evaris tightened the faded scarf around his neck, a talisman against the plain's chill, and resolved to rendezvous with this mysterious host. <words>195</words>
The maze twisted cruelly, its paths shifting as if alive, yet Evaris pressed on, his naively sophisticated mind spinning grand theories about destiny and purpose. <words>221</words>
At last, he stumbled into a clearing where a spectral figure awaited, not a spirit but a projection of the plain itself, an echo of intention given form. <words>249</words>
It spoke in riddles, its voice a rustle of corn, challenging Evaris to define his purpose through a single act of will. <words>272</words>
Uncertain, Evaris hesitated, then recalled the faded scarf's warmth, a memory of his mother's laughter, and proposed a game—a test of shared laughter to bind their spirits. <words>300</words>
The projection, amused by this odd noble, agreed, and they traded jests, Evaris's dry wit clashing with the plain's ancient, eerie humor until a genuine chuckle escaped them both. <words>329</words>
In that moment of shared laughter, the maze shuddered, revealing a path outward, as if the power of intention had crystallized in their fleeting connection. <words>354</words>
Evaris, no longer listless, felt the scarf's weight lighten, a symbol of renewed purpose, as he understood that intention was not a grand decree but a spark of authentic will. <words>384</words>
With ironic awe, he bowed to the projection, the haunted plain's vastness no longer a prison but a canvas for his newfound resolve. <words>407</words>
As he followed the path, the corn maze seemed to salute him, whispering of beginnings even in a world before sentience. <words>429</words>
