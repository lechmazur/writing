In the lunar mining colony of Crater's Edge, where dust clung to every surface like a second skin, lived Malakar, the ambivalent prophet, whose visions flickered between doom and salvation. <words>29</words> His shack, carved into a cavern wall, overlooked the endless gray expanse, a fitting stage for his bashful arrogance—proclaiming fates he half-believed with a smirk and a shrug. <words>58</words> Among his sparse belongings was a collection of cracked marbles, each fissure a map of fractured prophecies, which he cradled as if they held the moon's own secrets. <words>86</words> Malakar felt happily sad gazing at them, a bittersweet ache for destinies he could neither fully embrace nor escape. <words>106</words> His latest vision, pulsing between heartbeats, revealed the final oath—a cosmic vow that could reset the universe's tally, scrambling the cosmic scoreboard where gods kept score of mortal sins. <words>136</words> This oath was his obsession, a chance to defy the divine ledger with a trickster's grin, though doubt gnawed at his resolve. <words>159</words>

The colony buzzed with miners hauling regolith, their lives as gray as the lunar dust, unaware of Malakar's silent war against fate. <words>182</words> His method to unlock the oath was peculiar: defragmenting his scattered visions through jigsaw puzzle edges found in a rummage sale box, discarded by some homesick miner. <words>210</words> Each jagged piece, worn and mismatched, mirrored his own splintered mind, and as he pieced them together under a flickering lamp, the cracks in his marbles seemed to whisper clues. <words>241</words> Between heartbeats, time stretched thin, each second a cavernous void where he wrestled with the puzzle, his fingers trembling with both pride and shame. <words>266</words> The lunar setting amplified his isolation—gravity's weak grip a metaphor for his tenuous hold on certainty, the colony's harsh silence echoing his inner turmoil. <words>292</words> Yet, the final oath demanded completion; to scramble the cosmic scoreboard was to upend the gods' cruel game, a motive born from equal parts spite and longing for meaning. <words>322</words>

As the puzzle neared completion, a crude image of a shattered sphere emerged, mirroring his marbles, and with it, the oath's words crystallized in his mind. <words>349</words> He spoke them aloud, voice cracking like the marbles, a bashful arrogance in defying the heavens while fearing their wrath. <words>370</words> Between heartbeats, the colony trembled, as if the moon itself felt the scoreboard shift, sins and virtues tumbling into chaos. <words>392</words> Malakar smiled, happily sad, knowing he'd altered fate yet unsure if he'd saved or damned them all. <words>410</words> In Crater's Edge, under a sky of endless black, he clutched his cracked marbles, a prophet no longer ambivalent but forever questioning. <words>434</words>
