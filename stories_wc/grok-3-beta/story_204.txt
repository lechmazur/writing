In the cavernous shell of an abandoned spaceport hangar, where rusted gantries loomed like ancient relics, Mara, a professional cuddler, stood amidst the hush before an acceptance speech was to begin. <words>29</words>
The air buzzed with unspoken rules, a silent code among the gathered misfits who’d turned this forgotten place into a clandestine farmer’s market. <words>51</words>
Mara, with her unusually usual demeanor—plain yet oddly comforting—navigated the stalls, her touch a currency of solace in a world decayed by isolation. <words>75</words>
Her motivation burned deep: to overcome a deep-seated prejudice against physical closeness, a bias born from a childhood of cold distances. <words>96</words>
The hangar, steeped in an ancient novelty, echoed with whispers of bygone interstellar dreams, its walls etched with the ghosts of voyages never taken. <words>120</words>
As she bartered for a wilted herb bundle, a chance encounter unfolded—a wiry old man, his eyes sharp as forgotten stars, pressed a phantom train ticket punch into her palm. <words>150</words>
It was no ordinary tool; its metal shimmered with an otherworldly patina, a relic of a spectral rail that once ferried souls through cosmic voids. <words>175</words>
He muttered, “Punch the ticket to decay old fears,” before vanishing into the crowd, leaving Mara to ponder the weight of his cryptic gift. <words>200</words>
The hush deepened as the speech neared, a community leader’s voice soon to unite them, yet Mara felt the unspoken rules tighten—touch was her trade, but trust was taboo. <words>230</words>
She clutched the punch, its edges biting her skin, and saw her prejudice as a ticket to be voided, a barrier to decay under the weight of connection. <words>258</words>
The hangar’s vastness mirrored her inner expanse, a place where ancient fears could crumble like the rust around her, if only she dared to break the silence. <words>285</words>
With the crowd’s eyes on the makeshift stage, Mara approached a trembling vendor, a woman whose hunched shoulders screamed loneliness, and offered a gentle embrace. <words>310</words>
The unspoken rule shattered in that moment, a quiet rebellion against decay of spirit, as the phantom punch in her pocket seemed to hum with approval. <words>337</words>
Whispers rippled through the market, not of scorn but curiosity, as if the ancient novelty of the spaceport blessed this breach of custom. <words>361</words>
Mara felt her prejudice decay further with each shared warmth, each hesitant hug, the ticket punch a talisman against her old, cold self. <words>385</words>
As the speech began, its words lost to her pounding heart, Mara knew she’d punched through her fears, forging new rules in this forgotten hangar. <words>411</words>
The spaceport, once a tomb of dead dreams, now cradled a living market of touch and trust, her journey a quiet triumph over ancient biases. <words>438</words>
