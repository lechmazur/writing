In the reimagined ancient Persian palace, where golden domes pierced a twilight sky, Bahram, a weary undertaker, shuffled through marble corridors, his heart heavy with the weight of endless farewells. <words>27</words>
The palace, once a seat of kings, now stood as a mausoleum of forgotten dreams, its walls whispering tribal knowledge of old—secrets of life and death rarely practical in a world that had moved on. <words>62</words>
Bahram, driven by a desperate motivation to hold onto hope in the absolute dark, sought the astronomical clock at the palace’s heart, a relic said to map the heavens and bind time itself. <words>95</words>
Its intricate dials, etched with sun paths, ticked with a placid ferocity, mirroring Bahram’s quiet rage against the inevitability of decay. <words>117</words>
He had buried too many, their stories slipping into oblivion, and now, in the hush after a car backfires in a silent street beyond the palace walls, the eerie stillness amplified his resolve. <words>152</words>
The tribal knowledge, passed through generations of undertakers, spoke of the clock’s power to imprison time, to halt the relentless march of loss if one followed the sun paths precisely. <words>183</words>
Bahram’s hands, calloused from digging graves, trembled as he adjusted the clock’s gears, aligning them with the sun’s ancient trajectory, a method both sacred and futile in its rarity. <words>213</words>
Each turn of the dial was a prayer, a defiance against the dark that swallowed hope, his weary eyes burning with a ferocity that belied his stooped frame. <words>243</words>
The palace, with its labyrinthine halls and faded mosaics, seemed to hold its breath, as if complicit in his mission to trap time, to keep the dawn from stealing another soul. <words>275</words>
Tribal lore warned that such an act was rarely practical, for time was a river no man could dam, yet Bahram’s grief fueled his stubborn hope. <words>302</words>
As the clock’s hands aligned with the sun’s path, a low hum vibrated through the stone, and for a moment, in that silent aftermath of the car’s backfire, time seemed to stutter. <words>336</words>
Bahram felt it—a fleeting imprisonment of the inevitable, a fragile bubble of stillness where loss could not reach, where hope might linger just a little longer. <words>363</words>
But the tribal knowledge held true; the clock’s power waned, practicality slipping away, and time surged forward once more, relentless as ever. <words>387</words>
Yet, in that brief defiance, Bahram found a sliver of peace, his placid ferocity softening as he accepted that even in the absolute dark, hope could flicker, if only for a moment. <words>422</words>
