High above the jagged cliffs of the sky burial site, where vultures wheeled under a bruised and electric sky, the cyber-templar, Sereth Vax, stood on the edge of a reality fracturing like glass. <words>29</words>
His armor, a fusion of ancient steel and pulsing circuitry, hummed with a patiently frantic energy, mirroring his mind's desperate need to act while tethered to a sacred calm. <words>58</words>
In his gauntleted hand, he clutched a worn leather bridle, a relic of a lost steed, now a talisman of control over the chaos threatening to unmake him. <words>86</words>
The mirage of safety had lured him here, to this desolate plateau where the dead were offered to the heavens, a false promise of sanctuary amid the storm's brewing wrath. <words>116</words>
Sereth's mission was singular: to prove, through the refraction of light through a prism, that he could reflect lightning back at the storm, turning nature's fury into a mirror of defiance. <words>148</words>
The prism, a shard of crystal embedded in his chest plate, glowed with captured dawn, a tool to bend the tempest's rage into a weapon of salvation. <words>175</words>
During reading—an ancient ritual of reciting the names of the fallen as their bones were laid bare to the sky—Sereth felt the weight of every soul, their whispers fueling his euphoric agitation. <words>209</words>
The storm growled closer, a beast of static and shadow, and Sereth's heart raced with a joy tinged by dread, a fervor to challenge the heavens themselves. <words>237</words>
He knelt among the skeletal remains, the bridle draped over a stone altar, a tether to ground him as he prepared to face the collision course with reality. <words>266</words>
Reality, after all, was the storm—a force that shattered illusions, that stripped away the mirage of safety he'd clung to in his crusade against entropy. <words>293</words>
With the prism raised, he chanted the names louder, his voice a beacon as lightning arced down, drawn to the cyber-templar's defiant stand. <words>318</words>
The light struck the prism, refracting into a kaleidoscope of searing beams, and Sereth angled it with trembling precision, sending the bolt screaming back into the roiling clouds. <words>347</words>
A thunderous roar answered, the storm recoiling as if wounded, and Sereth's laughter rang out, wild and triumphant, over the wind-swept burial site. <words>371</words>
Yet, even in victory, he knew the mirage lingered—safety was never real, only a fleeting reflection, and the storm would return, hungrier. <words>395</words>
Still, with the bridle in hand and the prism's glow fading, Sereth stood taller, a cyber-templar forged anew in the crucible of lightning and loss. <words>422</words>
