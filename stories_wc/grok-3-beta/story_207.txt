<story>
In the abandoned medical bay of a derelict space station, where rusted instruments lay scattered like forgotten dreams, a forthright peddler named Elias hummed a tune of joyful loneliness. <words>27</words>
The universe outside hummed its secret song, a cosmic melody vibrating through the station's hollow shell, as Elias sifted through rumor-laden gossip columns on a cracked data pad, seeking whispers of redemption's path. <words>58</words>
Clutched in his weathered hands was a dried flower bouquet, brittle petals a relic of a blood-sealed oath he swore to a dying friendâ€”to find and save their lost kin. <words>87</words>
Elias, though meekly assertive, spoke with a quiet strength, bartering stories and trinkets with ghostly echoes of past crew members he imagined lingering in the sterile air. <words>114</words>
His motivation burned bright: to break that oath sealed in blood, not out of betrayal, but to rewrite its tragic end into a reunion of hope. <words>141</words>
The medical bay, once a place of healing, now stood as a mausoleum of silence, its flickering lights casting shadows over Elias's solitary quest. <words>166</words>
As the universe's song pulsed through the void, he divided his search into fragments of truth and lies, meticulously parsing each gossip column for clues about the lost kin's last sighting. <words>197</words>
A rumor of a hidden shuttle crash on a nearby asteroid belt surfaced, and Elias's heart leapt with a lonely joy, picturing the reunion that might await. <words>225</words>
He traced the bouquet's faded ribbon with trembling fingers, remembering the oath's weight, a promise made under a sky of falling stars, now mirrored in the station's shattered viewports. <words>254</words>
With meekly assertive resolve, he muttered to the empty bay, "I'll find them, even if I wander this void forever," his voice a soft defiance against the universe's indifference. <words>283</words>
The gossip columns hinted at a survivor colony, and Elias divided his dwindling supplies, rationing for a journey to the belt, driven by the bouquet's silent reminder of his purpose. <words>313</words>
Each rumor sifted felt like peeling back layers of his own guilt, a redemption's path carved through whispered half-truths and the station's desolate hum. <words>338</words>
The universe's secret song grew louder, as if urging him onward, a companion to his joyful loneliness, resonating with the hope of breaking the oath's curse. <words>365</words>
In the medical bay's cold embrace, Elias packed his meager belongings, the dried flower bouquet tucked close, a fragile beacon guiding him toward absolution. <words>390</words>
With a final glance at the abandoned space, he stepped into the unknown, ready to divide fact from fiction, to redeem a promise, and to sing with the universe's endless hymn. <words>421</words>
