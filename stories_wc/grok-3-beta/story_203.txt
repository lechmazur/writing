Father Elias, an exorcist plagued by stage fright, floated among the orbital debris of a shattered space station, his breath shallow in the defiant hush of the void. <words>27</words>
Amid toy assembly—plastic limbs and gears scattered like lost dreams—he worked to rebuild a child’s robot, a task grounding him against the terror of speaking rites aloud. <words>55</words>
His inheritance of lies, a family legacy of hidden fears masquerading as courage, weighed heavier than the debris around him; he’d been taught to bury doubt, not banish it. <words>83</words>
Yet, his mission was never usual, a ritual to cleanse not a soul but a place—a cursed fragment of the station where ghostly transmissions whispered of despair. <words>110</words>
Clutching a book of pressed wildflowers, a relic from Earth his grandmother swore held protective spirits, he traced the brittle petals for strength against his trembling voice. <words>138</words>
Each flower, flattened between pages, symbolized a lie he’d inherited: that fear was weakness, that silence was safety, and he now sought to sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never.” <words>167</words>
Never speak, never falter, never fail—those were the unspoken rules of his lineage, but here, amid the wreckage, he’d defy them to reclaim his voice. <words>193</words>
The debris field, a graveyard of humanity’s ambition, mirrored his inner chaos, jagged metal and broken dreams orbiting in a silent, defiant hush that dared him to act. <words>221</words>
His motivation burned: to prove that even from “never” could rise a new beginning, a possibility carved from the ruins of fear and falsehood. <words>245</words>
As he prepared the exorcism, he heard it—the sound of a key turning in a lock, an eerie metallic echo from a nearby panel, signaling the cursed fragment awakening. <words>274</words>
That sound, unnatural in the vacuum, was his cue; it unlocked not just the haunted sector but his resolve to confront the lies he’d carried too long. <words>301</words>
With the toy robot half-assembled, a tiny witness to his struggle, Elias submerged himself in the ritual, letting his voice—shaky but defiant—drown the silence of space. <words>329</words>
To submerge was to surrender to the act, to let the words of banishment flow despite the stage fright clawing at his throat, each syllable a rebellion. <words>356</words>
The pressed wildflowers, tucked into his suit, seemed to pulse with ancestral strength, urging him to rewrite the inheritance of lies into a truth of courage. <words>383</words>
As the ghostly whispers faded, banished by his unsteady but persistent chant, Elias felt the orbital debris shift, as if the station itself exhaled a long-held curse. <words>411</words>
In that defiant hush, amid toy assembly and broken orbits, he sculpted a new possibility: a legacy not of lies, but of facing fear head-on, voice trembling but unbroken. <words>441</words>
