In the ethereal heights of Cloud City, where skyscrapers pierced the mist and platforms floated on engineered winds, Dorian Vale operated as a professional scapegoat for hire, absorbing blame for the elite who couldn't afford a tarnished name. <words>33</words> After the last library card was returned to the desk, marking the end of an era of borrowed knowledge in this sky-bound metropolis, Dorian felt the weight of his own abandoned identity pressing down like a storm cloud. <words>67</words> He had long forsaken his true self, becoming a robustly delicate shell—strong in taking blows, yet fragile beneath the surface, yearning for meaning beyond being a shield for others. <words>94</words> His obsession to decode sacred symbols, etched into the city's ancient floating ruins, became his silent rebellion, pursued with an obsessive calm that masked his inner turmoil. <words>121</words> These symbols, rumored to hold the key to lost identities, called to him like a forgotten name whispered in the wind. <words>142</words>

Late one night, as the city hummed with the quiet of sleeping engines, Dorian received the first of many cryptic phone calls at midnight, a distorted voice guiding him toward a hidden truth. <words>175</words> The caller spoke in riddles, hinting at a metal washer—a seemingly mundane object—buried in the ruins, said to be a relic of the city's founders, a key to unlocking the sacred symbols. <words>207</words> Each call, delivered with eerie precision, fueled his determination, pulling him deeper into the labyrinth of Cloud City's underbelly, where forgotten platforms rusted beneath the polished upper tiers. <words>235</words> The washer, when he finally unearthed it, was cold and unassuming, yet it bore faint engravings that matched the symbols he sought to understand. <words>258</words> Its robustly delicate nature mirrored his own—a simple ring of metal, yet intricate in its hidden purpose, much like Dorian's facade of strength over a fractured core. <words>285</words>

Through these midnight calls, Dorian began to refashion himself, piecing together not just the symbols' meaning but the fragments of who he once was before becoming a scapegoat. <words>313</words> The voice on the line, cryptic yet guiding, seemed to know his past, urging him to reclaim his abandoned identity by aligning the washer's engravings with the ruins' patterns. <words>341</words> Night after night, perched on a crumbling platform with the city’s lights twinkling below, he worked with obsessive calm, tracing lines in the mist, decoding messages of origin and purpose. <words>371</words> The final call revealed the truth: the symbols were a map to selfhood, and the washer, when placed in a ruin's central altar, projected a hologram of Cloud City's first citizen—Dorian's ancestor. <words>405</words> In that moment, he understood—his role as scapegoat was a distortion of a sacred duty to protect, not to be blamed, and with this knowledge, he stepped into a refashioned life. <words>437</words>
