In the haunted lighthouse signal room, where ghostly whispers clung to the salt-worn walls, Elias, an amiable scholar, sat hunched over a half-finished crossword page, his pencil trembling with anticipation. <words>27</words>
The room, perched atop a jagged cliff, flickered with the erratic pulse of a dying lantern, casting shadows that danced like specters across the cracked glass of the signal window. <words>55</words>

Through the stories told by an old ship’s timbers, salvaged and embedded in the lighthouse’s frame, Elias heard tales of lost sailors and forgotten storms, each groan a chapter of despair and hope. <words>176</words>
