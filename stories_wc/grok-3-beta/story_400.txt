In the glacial orchard suspended over a crevasse of blue ice, where frozen apple trees glittered like glass under an endless twilight, the guarded druid, Elowen, stood alone after the last human had set foot on Earth. <words>33</words>
Centuries of solitude had carved her heart into a fortress, her fiercely ambivalent nature warring between longing for connection and dreading its pain. <words>55</words>
Yet, a crippling fear of eternal silence gnawed at her, a terror that her voice, her story, would vanish into the icy void. <words>78</words>
Today, on what she deemed her birthday—a date chosen arbitrarily in a world without calendars—she resolved to break the silence. <words>99</words>
Clutched in her frostbitten hand was a dull safety pin, a relic from the last human, found pinned to a tattered scarf at the crevasse’s edge. <words>125</words>
It was a mundane thing, yet it symbolized a tether to a lost world, a reminder of voices once heard, now gone. <words>148</words>
With dour amusement, she smirked at the absurdity of her plan: to gather the spirits of the orchard, the whispers of the ice, for a special family meal prepared only on birthdays. <words>180</words>
This meal, a ritual from her ancient kin, was a stew of frozen roots and glacial melt, boiled over a fire of enchanted twigs. <words>205</words>
As she trudged through the orchard, her cloak dragging over icy boughs, she gathered fragments of memory—echoes of laughter, snippets of song—trapped in the frost. <words>231</words>
Each step was a battle against her fear, her ambivalence roaring within: why speak when no one truly listens? <words>250</words>
But the safety pin, pinned now to her chest, pricked her with every breath, a dull sting urging her onward. <words>271</words>
At the orchard’s heart, where the crevasse yawned widest, its blue ice glowing like a frozen heartbeat, she set her cauldron. <words>293</words>
She stirred the stew, murmuring incantations, her voice cracking like thawing ice, breaking the silence she’d hoarded for eons. <words>313</words>
The spirits gathered, faint shimmers in the air, drawn by the warmth of her words, the scent of a meal meant for family. <words>337</words>
Elowen’s dour amusement deepened as she ladled stew into cracked bowls, half-laughing at the irony of hosting ghosts in a world so empty. <words>361</words>
Yet, as she spoke of her fears, her losses, her voice grew steadier, the safety pin a quiet anchor against her trembling. <words>383</words>
The silence shattered, replaced by a chorus of whispers, the orchard alive with forgotten voices, and Elowen felt her fear loosen its grip. <words>407</words>
In this frozen, impossible place, she found a fleeting family, a birthday shared, and the courage to speak, even if only to the ice. <words>432</words>
