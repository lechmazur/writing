<story>
In the underground city of the mole people, long after the last star burned out, Kael, the eternal college student, wandered the labyrinthine tunnels, his obsession with immortality etched into every step. <words>29</words>
His pale hands clutched a coal miner’s headlamp, salvaged from a collapsed mine, its cracked lens flickering with a mundanely glorious light that pierced the endless dark. <words>56</words>
This relic, a gifted burden from a forgotten surface dweller, weighed on him—not just physically, but as a reminder of lives extinguished while he persisted, unchanging. <words>82</words>
Kael’s detached devotion to his studies drove him deeper into the mole people’s realm, where bioluminescent fungi painted the walls and eyeless denizens whispered of forgotten epochs. <words>109</words>
His motivation was singular: to become a master of his own reality, to defy the entropy that claimed even stars, by unlocking the secret of eternal existence. <words>137</words>
Among the mole people, who revered him as a living artifact, he bartered knowledge via swapped travel journals, their brittle pages filled with cryptic maps and musings on survival. <words>166</words>
One journal, traded from a mole elder, hinted at a digital archive—a repository of ancient human consciousness buried in the city’s core, accessible only through forgotten tech. <words>194</words>
Kael saw his path: to digitize his essence, to shed the flesh that tethered him to time, and ascend beyond the gifted burden of his endless studenthood. <words>221</words>
The headlamp’s dim glow guided him through collapsing tunnels, its light a mundanely glorious beacon of hope amid the suffocating dark, mirroring his own stubborn persistence. <words>248</words>
He found the archive chamber, a cavern of humming obsidian servers, relics of a lost age, guarded by mole sentinels who saw his quest as both sacred and profane. <words>277</words>
With a journal’s code scrawled in trembling ink, he accessed the system, his fingers trembling not from fear but from the weight of becoming—finally—his own creator. <words>304</words>
The digitization process burned through him, his memories and fears uploading in jagged bursts, the headlamp flickering as if mourning the loss of its bearer’s humanity. <words>331</words>
Yet, as his consciousness merged with the archive, Kael felt the gifted burden lift; immortality was no longer a chase but a constructed reality, his to shape. <words>358</words>
The mole people, witnessing his transcendence, etched his story into their fungal murals, a mundanely glorious tale of a student who outlasted the stars themselves. <words>383</words>
Now, Kael exists as code, a master of his reality, watching over the underground city with detached devotion, forever unbound by time, yet tethered to its memory. <words>411</words>
