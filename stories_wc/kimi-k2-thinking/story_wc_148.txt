The lighthouse prison loomed off a jagged reef, its stone walls drenched in copperlight repose. [15] Within, the son of the boy who cried wolf paced the spiral corridor, listening for silence. [31] His father's false alarms had become legend, but the echo of those lies still haunted these walls. [48] He had come to thread a labyrinth with his own story, to carve truth into stone. [64] The prison's cells were empty now, but the air still carried the weight of old cries. [80] In a forgotten chapel, he found a lattice from a confessional, its wood dark with age. [96] The lattice seemed to sustain impossibilities; whispers lingered in its grain that should have faded long ago. [113] He lifted it, and the air around it began to hover, a faint shimmer of copper glow. [130] The lighthouse keeper remembered the narrow door left ajar for decades, its paint scuffed by desperate hands. [147] Through the scuffs on that door he traced a pattern, a map etched in neglect. [162] The map promised a hidden chamber where the prison's oldest secrets were kept. [175] He pressed the lattice against the door, and the wood groaned, the scuffs flaring into light. [191] The door swung inward, revealing a spiral staircase that descended into darkness. [203] He descended, the lattice in hand, its copper glow casting long shadows on stone. [217] The air grew colder, and the sound of the reef below faded to a hush. [232] He was chasing hush, that elusive silence that promised rest for the restless dead. [246] The lighthouse prison had been built to hold those who could not be silenced, and now it held only echoes. [266] He reached the bottom, a chamber where the walls were lined with cells, each sealed with rusted iron. [284] In the center, a stone altar held a single candle burning with a copper flame. [299] The lattice began to vibrate, its wood humming a note that sustained impossibilities. [312] He placed the lattice on the altar, the copperlight repose deepening into a hush. [326] The echo of his father's false cries seemed to hover above the altar, a ghostly presence. [342] He began to speak, his voice threading the labyrinth with his own story. [355] Each word carved into the stone, each sentence a step toward silencing the past. [369] The lattice caught his words, the wood sustaining the impossibility of truth within a lie. [384] Above, the lighthouse beam swept the reef, but the prisoners' bodies remained hidden, waiting. [398] He knew that soon they would find the bodies, and his chance to chase hush would end. [415] So he spoke faster, weaving his story into the lattice, into the stone, into the silence. [431] The copperlight repose thickened, a heavy quiet that swallowed the echo of his father's lies. [446] When he finished, the lattice glowed, the impossible sustained, the hush now a living thing. [461] He stepped back, the narrow door's scuffs now bright with the light of his tale. [476] The door swung shut, sealing the chamber before they find the bodies. [488] In the silence, the lighthouse stood sentinel, its copperlight repose guarding the threaded labyrinth. [502] The boy who had inherited his father's curse had finally threaded his own story into the stone. [519] He left the lighthouse, the lattice left behind, sustaining the impossible, chasing hush forever. [533] The tide whispered against the reef, a sound that would soon bring the world to the prison's door. [551] He thought of his father's warnings, now silent, as the copperlight dimmed into a final repose. [567] The lattice, a relic of confessions, would sustain the impossibility of his silence, an eternal chase. [583] He walked away, his footsteps swallowed by the reef's jagged voice, leaving only the lighthouse's copper glow. [600] When the search party finally arrived, they would find the labyrinth lit by a faint, impossible light. [617] And in the lattice's pattern, they would read the story of a boy who learned to chase hush. [635] The bodies, long silent, would tell no tales, but the lighthouse would never stop whispering. [650] Thus the son of the boy who cried wolf vanished into the copperlight, his story threaded into stone. [668] The hush he chased became the lighthouse's breath, and the impossible was now the only truth. [684] The narrow door remained ajar, its scuffs now a map for those who dared to listen. [700] And the lattice, a relic, waited in the silence, sustaining the impossible story of a quiet boy. [717] The lighthouse prison stood guard, its copperlight repose a testament to the chase that never ends. [733] The hush lingered. [736] Forever, the lighthouse stands. [740]
