The undertaker had long since forgotten the sound of silence, that pure absence that once meant peace. [14]
For thirty years, they had tended to the drowned in the sunken city of Marea, where the library's drowned archives held more corpses than books, and the shelves groaned with the weight of waterlogged histories. [28]
Their hands were permanent wrinkles of silt and sorrow, each line a road map to a burial they could not forget. [17]
When the package arrived—wrapped in oilskin and barnacles, delivered by a current that shouldn't exist—they assumed it was another body, perhaps a recent victim of the reef's hunger. [24]
It was not. [3]
Inside lay a lighthouse lens, fractured into seven pieces, each edge glowing with a faint phosphorescence that pulsed like a dying heartbeat. [20]
The note, written in salt-stained ink on parchment that should have dissolved decades ago, read: "They need directions home." [18]
The undertaker was weary, not just in body but in soul, having buried thousands in the silt where the city's streets once ran, marking each grave with nothing but memory. [26]
But they were also inadvertently stubborn, a trait that had kept them alive when the city fell and everyone else fled upward toward the sun and air. [23]
This stubbornness manifested as a refusal to abandon the dead, even as their own lungs learned to sip from pockets of trapped atmosphere like a miser hoarding coins. [24]
They told themselves they would leave after this last task, that the underwater library was only a temporary refuge, not a mausoleum, not a permanent address for their own decay. [24]
Yet the lens began to hum, vibrating through the water with frequencies that spoke in the voices of those they'd interred, a chorus of whispers that bypassed ears and spoke directly to marrow. [27]
These were distress signals, not for rescue, but for rest—proper rest, not the restless sleep of the unremembered who drifted through the city's ruins like forgotten prayers. [25]
The undertaker realized the library, with its impossible architecture of air pockets and pressure-bent shelves, its rooms that existed simultaneously at thirty fathoms and sea level, was already a space between worlds. [30]
To give rest a permanent address, they would need to revitalize something that had never truly lived: the lighthouse's purpose of guidance, now repurposed for the journey into true death. [26]
The method came in dreams, where they occupied impossible spaces—not quite breathing, not quite drowned, suspended in the library's central atrium where water and air refused to separate, creating a twilight state of neither and both. [32]
In these dreams, they learned the lens was not broken by accident but by design, its fractures meant to split one signal into many, to address each soul individually. [24]
They gathered materials with the patience of the dead: silver wire from a ship's skeleton, a pearl divers' tears had polished for centuries, and their own blood as binding agent, which the lens drank eagerly. [30]
Days blurred into weeks as they rebuilt the lens within that impossible atrium, fitting each piece together while their own body began to show signs of transformation—not quite fish, not quite human, but something that could occupy both worlds. [32]
When the last piece clicked into place, the entire library shuddered, and the distress signals transformed, morphing from cries of pain into coordinates—addresses etched in light, mapping a final destination for each soul that had been lost. [30]
The undertaker, now both keeper and beacon, stood within the lens's glow, their own shadow stretching across the drowned city like a permanent fixture, their form becoming part of the library's architecture. [27]
They had succeeded in giving rest an address: here, in the impossible space between memory and abyss, where the lighthouse still guided, not ships, but souls to their final harbor. [26]
But the stillness they sought remained chased, always one signal away from perfection, the silence they craved continually fractured by new arrivals. [19]
For every soul they laid to proper rest, another arrived, drawn by the light that should not exist, the beacon that served both as grave and gateway. [24]
The undertaker understood then that their stubbornness had built not an escape, but an eternal occupation, a role they had inadvertently claimed through sheer refusal to surrender. [24]
They were the librarian of the drowned, the undertaker who could not quit, revitalizing peace for others while their own chased stillness through the depths like a minnow fleeing a shark that was also itself. [28]
The package had not brought them a tool, but a sentence—one they would serve in the quiet that was never quite quiet enough. [20]
And in the underwater city's forgotten library, the broken lens continued to shine, sending its impossible signals upward, downward, everywhere rest was needed, while its keeper waited for a silence that would never quite catch them. [29]
