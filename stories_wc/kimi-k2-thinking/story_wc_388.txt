Elias sorted through the mulberry roots, his fingers finding paper edges where only soil should be. [14]
The orchard shouldn't exist here, in the lee of Old Mountain, where radioactive dust storms scoured everything else to glass. [20] [34]
But the trees bore fruit heavy and sweet, and the settlers whispered it was protection from the flawed diamond. [18] [52]
They called it the liquidation gem, said it cursed anyone who questioned its power. [13] [65]
Elias was a conspiracy debunker by trade, which meant he survived by excavating truth from comfortable lies. [16] [81]
After the liquidation, truth had become scarcer than clean water, and just as contested. [12] [93]
He'd noticed how the storms always diverted at the same elevation, how the rad-count dropped near the western well. [16] [109]
Sharply observant, he collected these anomalies like other men collected rainwater, storing them in his mind for the pattern they might reveal. [20] [129]
The shredded letters had been buried shallow, perhaps by someone in a hurry before the liquidation erased all records. [15] [144]
He carried them back to his shelter, a converted water tank where he worked by the blue flicker of a salvaged LED. [18] [162]
Reassembling shredded letters was like reconstructing a skeleton from dust, but the fragments shared a watermark he recognized from pre-liberation bureaucracy. [21] [183]
The paper still smelled of earth and old panic, cut by machines that no longer existed. [12] [195]
As he pieced together the governor's correspondence, a pattern emerged that his mind could almost intuit, like recognizing a face through shattered glass. [21] [216]
The letters spoke of a project called STILLPOINT, a failsafe bunker built beneath the mountain during the war. [16] [232]
It was designed as a sanctuary for the elite, a place where radiation couldn't reach. [13] [245]
The diamond wasn't cursed, it was a key—a flawed crystal that refracted radiation signatures toward the hidden entrance. [16] [261]
Its imperfection was deliberate, a signature cutter that scattered gamma rays in a unique pattern. [11] [272]
The curse rumor had been manufactured by the same engineers who built the bunker, a final lock to keep scavengers away. [17] [289]
Elias understood now why the orchard thrived: its roots tapped into the bunker's geothermal vents, creating a bubble of clean air in the wasteland. [23] [312]
The settlers believed in the curse because it was easier than facing the liquidation's real purpose. [13] [325]
They had been left here as living shields, expendable flesh to guard the mountain's secret while the worthy waited below. [17] [342]
He finished the reconstruction at dawn, the final fragment showing coordinates etched into the diamond's base in code. [15] [357]
The gem sat in the council chamber, displayed in a lockbox they opened only during storms to "appease its temper." [16] [373]
Council members wore lead-lined gloves when they handled it, a superstition that now made perfect technical sense. [13] [386]
Elias didn't need to steal it. [5] [391]
His sharply observant nature had already mapped the distortion patterns in the air, the way certain wavelengths bent around the well. [19] [410]
He had spent weeks charting the silent dance of dust devils that spiraled backward near the old root cellar. [16] [426]
He could intuit the stillpoint's location by the way the mutated bees avoided one particular quadrant of the orchard. [17] [443]
Even the soil there was warmer to the touch, a fact he'd dismissed until the letters revealed the geothermal vents. [16] [459]
The truth he'd excavated wasn't just about survival, but about who deserved to know the way out. [15] [474]
The council had built their power on fear of the curse, on the comfortable lie that they were the chosen protectors. [17] [491]
But Elias had seen the orchard's secret geometry, the way its rows aligned with subterranean corridors. [14] [505]
He'd watched how the council leader's daughter never fell ill, how she disappeared into the root cellar during the worst storms. [18] [523]
These observations had cost him friends, gotten him labeled as a dangerous questioner. [11] [534]
He gathered the reassembled letters and walked toward the council, the orchard's impossible greenness bright around him. [16] [550]
Dust already gathered on the horizon, the next storm visible as a wall of rust and static. [12] [562]
They would call him a heretic, claim he was cursed by the diamond he sought to understand. [14] [576]
But Elias had built his life on a different kind of faith: that patterns spoke louder than authority. [14] [590]
When the warning sirens began to wail, he would show them the stillpoint, and let them choose their own curse. [17] [607]
