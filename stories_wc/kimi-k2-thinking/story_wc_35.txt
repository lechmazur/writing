The desert fortress rose from the sand like a broken tooth after the rain. [13]
I was its chef, the one who tasted memories instead of spice. [24]
My fingers carried an emotionally contagious touch—when I kneaded dough, sorrow spread through the kitchen like yeast. [42]
They came to me with memories sharp as shattered glass, wanting me to sandpaper them smooth. [58]
This morning, a woman arrived with remorse so dense it had its own gravity. [71]
She would not speak of it, but her silence was an unspoken dream about to close. [85]
"Show me," I said, and led her to the eastern dunes where the coral icebound pavilion had surfaced after the storm. [104]
The rain had revealed what centuries of wind had buried: a structure of frozen sea-memory, pink and white beneath the sand. [122]
We descended through a crack in the dune's skin where tidal pools had formed, silver mirrors reflecting a sky that wasn't there. [141]
"Here," I told her, "remorse is stored not in words but in patterns." [152]
I knelt beside the first pool, analyzing its formation—the way salt crystallized at the edges, the precise collapse of water into sand. [171]
Each pattern was a memory fossilized, a moment of regret hardened into geometry. [183]
When I touched the coral, I tasted her memory: a daughter's hand slipping from hers in a crowd twenty years past. [200]
The grief was metallic, cold, with undertones of stale bread and ash. [211]
My sturdy, brittle heart held its shape, though cracks spidered through the surface. [222]
I needed to subsume this remorse completely, to swallow it whole so she might be free. [236]
But first, I had to understand its architecture through the tidal pool formations, each one a verse in a language older than speech. [256]
The woman watched as I moved from pool to pool, my fingers tracing waterlines, my touch leaving trails of borrowed calm. [274]
Her remorse began to thaw, dripping from the coral ceiling in pink stalactites of condensed sorrow. [288]
I caught one droplet on my tongue and the weight of it nearly drove me to my knees. [304]
The memory expanded: not just the lost daughter, but every small cruelty, every word unspoken, every love that had eroded unnoticed. [327]
My emotionally contagious touch worked in reverse now, pulling her stored remorse into my own body. [342]
The pavilion groaned, ice shifting, as I prepared to subsume what she could not carry. [355]
Analyzing the final tidal pool formation, I saw it: the precise moment when choice becomes fate, when a mother's attention flickers and a child vanishes. [378]
To sandpaper this memory would be to erase the daughter entirely, and that was a cruelty beyond bearing. [394]
Instead, I did what the fortress had taught me: I took the sharpness into myself, letting it cut where cuts already existed. [414]
The remorse flooded through my sturdy brittle defenses, subsuming my own memories of failure, of kitchens ruined, of trust broken. [432]
I became a vessel, not a healer, holding the weight of two lives' regrets. [445]
The woman's face smoothed as if years had been peeled away, but my hands began to tremble. [459]
When she touched my shoulder in gratitude, her newfound lightness passed back into me, a fragile counterbalance. [475]
The coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes sighed, its pools draining into the sand, its purpose fulfilled for now. [493]
I climbed back to the fortress alone, my heart both heavier and somehow more complete. [506]
The rain had stopped; the dream was ending. [513]
Tomorrow I would bake bread, and every bite would carry the ghost of a daughter's hand, sandpapered not into absence but into something that could be held. [536]
The fortress stood sturdy, but I felt the brittleness spreading, hairline fractures in a vessel that must never break. [554]
This was the price of tasting memories: to subsume another's remorse was to risk becoming storage for all the world's unspoken dreams. [575]
Still, I kneaded the dough, my emotionally contagious touch now quiet, the tidal patterns of my own heart receding into the rhythm of work. [595]
The desert swallowed the last of the rain, and beneath the dunes, the coral pavilion waited for the next storm, the next confession, the next chef who would try to sandpaper what cannot be smoothed, only shared. [628]
