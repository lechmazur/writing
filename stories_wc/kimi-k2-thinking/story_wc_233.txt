<story>The disenchanted queen stood at the base of the impossible mountain, her silk slippers already soaked through with melting snow. [20] For three moons, the same dream had wound through her sleep: a cobalt grotto above clouds, where starlight bled across the stones like silver wounds. [45] Her advisors called it madness when she announced her intention to climb. [57] The final warning had come at dawn, the court seer pressing brittle fingers to her temples, whispering that some mysteries were sealed for good reason. [82] But the queen's disenchantment ran deeper than fear. [90] She began the climb at twilight, her velvet cloak catching on thorns that grew upward, defying gravity with their delicate, deadly reach. [112] The air grew thin and strangely patterned, frost etching lacy menace across every surface, each crystal filigree a promise of slow suffocation. [134] Above, the sky purpled into something that wasn't quite night, stars visible through daylight's stubborn ghost. [150] She climbed for hours, her breath becoming the only constant, until the ridge emerged from mist like the spine of a sleeping god. [173] There, nestled between two stone teeth, glowed the ember grotto on the ridge, its mouth breathing out heat that melted the surrounding ice into dangerous lace. [199] Inside, the cobalt grotto above clouds revealed itself, walls dripping with mineral water that caught the bleeding starlight streaming through a crack in the mountain's peak. [225] The queen stepped forward, her voice softly commanding the darkness: "Show me what I've dreamt." [240] The grotto answered not with words but with memory, pouring into her mind the life of the mountain's first witness. [260] She saw a young woman, centuries past, who had also climbed seeking answers, only to become the ridge's eternal guardian. [280] The vision showed their breath synchronizing across time, a shared exhale spotting the first fireflies of summer that weren't fireflies at all, but embers of dying stars returning to earth. [310] Understanding flooded her: the recurring dreams were invitations, not warnings, and each queen who ignored them added another layer of frost to the mountain's curse. [335] But acceptance meant surrendering her throne, her life, her name to become the new sentinel of the ridge. [353] The queen stood motionless as the bleeding starlight pooled around her feet, its silver touch both baptism and erasure. [372] She thought of the court below, of the empty ceremonies and hollow crowns, and found she no longer belonged to them. [393] The mountain's ancient voice, softly commanding as her own had been, whispered the final truth. [408] "To unravel the mystery of recurring dreams," it said, "is to accept you were never the dreamer, but the dreamed." [428] The queen closed her eyes and breathed out, her exhaled mist joining the mountain's breath, the first fireflies of summer—star embers—igniting around her like a crown. [454] When she opened them again, her memories were already fading, replaced by the weight of a thousand years of watching. [474] Below, the kingdom would wake to find their queen vanished, and they would mourn for a season before crowning another. [494] But here, above the clouds where bleeding starlight painted eternity, the mystery was finally unraveled. [509] She had become the dream, and the dream had become the ridge, and the ember grotto burned on, waiting for the next disenchanted queen to climb. [535] In her fading humanity, she felt the familiar touch of disenchantment transform into something else—not the bitter resignation of a crown, but the quiet devotion of a keeper. [563] The softly commanding voice that had once ordered armies now coaxed snowdrops to push through permafrost. [579] She learned to read the bleeding starlight's patterns, each silver wound in the sky telling stories of queens who had come before. [601] Some had climbed in anger, others in sorrow, all seeking to unravel the mystery of recurring dreams that had haunted their bloodlines for generations. [625] The ember grotto on the ridge pulsed with their collective memory, each heartbeat a reminder that power was just another word for sacrifice. [648] And so the queen settled into her new existence, her presence as much a part of the mountain as the cobalt grotto above clouds. [672] She understood now that the final warning had not been a threat, but a gift—the last moment of choice before destiny crystallized. [694] When the next queen would come, as she inevitably would, climbing after her own final warning, the fireflies would gather again, star embers seeking their newest sister. [721] And the lacy menace of the frost would welcome her, beautiful and terrible, as it had welcomed them all. [740] The queen closed her eyes, feeling the rhythm of the ember grotto synchronize with her own, and waited for dawn. [760] </story>
