<story>The observatory drifted three kilometers above the dead zone, tethered to nothing but its own obsolete purpose. [17] Kael pressed the geode crystal against the scanning plate while the circuit breakers cooled their atomic rage in the next room. [38] She was a drone strike wedding survivor, one of seven who'd danced when the sky fell apart instead of confetti. [58] Now she hunted for the intangibly tangible: energy that pooled like blood in shadows, potential that never got to detonate. [78] The geode's hollow core held quantum imprints, each fracture a memory of pressure that could have become something beautiful. [97] Through perturbation theory, she mapped how slight disturbances in the electromagnetic field revealed where unused potential pooled. [114] It was a hunt measured in microvolts and grief, each data point a ghost she taught herself to recognize. [133] The observatory's tremor-dampeners groaned, a sound like distant thunder, or distant bombs. [145] Bleak exhilaration filled her lungs—this was purpose without promise, a chase across a battlefield of wasted chances. [162] The breakers had blown during her last calibration, when she'd pushed too hard trying to extract a full trauma-signature. [181] Now she had twenty minutes before the systems rebooted, twenty minutes to find what shouldn't exist. [197] Her fingers moved across the console, applying perturbation sequences that nudged reality just enough to make it confess. [215] Each nudge sent echoes through the geode, its crystalline structure humming with possibilities that never found ignition. [232] The wedding had been in a courtyard where geodes were table decorations, cheap novelty items holding hidden amethyst hearts. [251] When the missile struck, those crystals had shattered along with everything else, but their potential signatures remained. [268] That was the cruel joke—only the unused energy persisted, a memory of what could have been but never was. [287] The observatory tilted slightly, caught in a high-altitude current, and Kael steadied herself against the scanner. [303] Her reflection overlapped with the geode's ghost patterns, making her face seem both solid and spectral. [319] This was the unfiltered awakening: understanding that survival meant carrying the weight of all unlived possibilities. [335] Not just hers, but the photographer's, the aunt who'd flown from Kiev, the children who never finished their cake. [354] The perturbation algorithm screamed—she'd found a pool, a dense knot of energy beneath the ruins of the old cathedral. [373] It glittered like phantom diamonds, intangibly tangible, a presence she could feel in her teeth and bones. [390] Kael's hands shook as she locked the coordinates, knowing this wasn't salvation, only confirmation. [404] The breakers would cool completely in three minutes, and with them, this window into the world's buried grief. [422] She wasn't extracting this energy to use it—that would be another kind of violence. [436] She was simply mapping the geography of what never happened, creating monuments from the shadows of possibility. [453] The geode warmed in her palm, responding to the nearby pool with a sympathetic vibration. [468] For the first time since the explosion, Kael felt something other than survival—she felt the exhilaration of bearing witness. [487] Not to death, but to the immaculate potential that death had interrupted. [499] The system chimed—one minute remaining. [504] She placed the geode in the transfer slot, letting it drink the final readings like rainwater. [520] Outside, the world rotated in its indifferent arc, carrying other weddings, other strikes, other pools of never-was. [537] Kael watched the breakers' status light flicker from red to gold, the cooling cycle complete. [552] The geode sealed itself, now containing a galaxy of unspent futures, heavy and cold and perfect. [568] She had found where unused potential pools—in the spaces between heartbeats, in the silence after prayers, in the hollow center of surviving. [590] The hunt would continue tomorrow, and the next day, and the day after that. [604] But for now, Kael held the geode to the window, letting starlight pass through its crystallized ghosts. [621] Each refracted beam painted her skin with stories that would never be told, and that was enough. [638] It had to be. [642] The observatory hummed back to full power, and Kael began the next scan, her heart a broken geode in her chest. [663] Bleak exhilaration, she had learned, was the only honest way to float above a world that kept burying its future. [683] The hunt was not for vengeance, nor redemption, but for the simple, unbearable act of witnessing what could have been. [703] And in that witnessing, perhaps, the potential stopped being unused and became, instead, infinitely remembered. [718] The geode pulsed once in her pocket, and Kael smiled, a terrible, truthful smile. [732] Her twenty minutes were up. [737]</story>
