<story>The night swallowed the signal station whole, a black tide lapping at the edges of a broken world. [18] After the hydraulics failed, the dish had frozen mid-swing, its weight a silent scream against the gears. [35] Kael, the patchwork navigator, stitched his maps from memory and salvage, each line a scar on the landscape of loss. [55] He had come to this starlit perch to guide the lost back across the void his sister had vanished into. [75] The only tool he trusted was a patina bronze censer foot, an heirloom that warmed when the moon waxed and cooled when it waned. [99] Its weight fluctuated with the moon phases, pulling his hand in directions no compass could read. [115] Each midnight, a cryptic phone call rang through the station's lone handset, the voice a whisper of static and starlight. [135] The caller gave coordinates that shifted each night, a reverse migration charted in fragments. [149] Kael understood that he was being asked to build a bridge of signal, a path back for those who had drifted too far. [172] He had to do it before the next full moon, when the censer foot would be heaviest and the void most receptive. [194] The station's walls were lined with salvage: copper wire, glass lenses, and the rusted tongues of old speakers. [212] Kael began to build a resonator, soldering the censer foot into the heart of the machine, letting its lunar pulse guide the circuit. [235] Each midnight call added a new layer: a frequency, a modulation, a whisper of a name he could almost recognize. [255] The voice never answered his questions, only repeated: "Follow the foot, trace the glow, bring them home." [272] Kael felt the weight of loss in each solder joint, in each coil of wire that hummed with the memory of his sister's laughter. [296] The starlit sky pressed against the station's windows, a mosaic of cold light that seemed to mirror the fractured map in his mind. [319] He worked through the dark hours, the only sound the scrape of metal and the faint hiss of the phone line. [340] As the moon waxed, the censer foot grew heavier, its pull more insistent, dragging his hand toward a hidden frequency. [360] The midnight call on the seventh night was different: a series of tones, then silence, then a single word: "Now." [380] Kael activated the resonator, and the station shuddered as the censer foot pulsed, its bronze gleam flooding the room with ghostly light. [402] The signal shot outward, a reverse migration of data, of voices, of souls that had been scattered across the void. [422] He heard his sister's voice, faint but clear, calling his name from a place that had no map. [440] Tears carved rivers down his dust-streaked face as the raw solace of hearing her again flooded through him. [458] The station groaned, the hydraulics' failure now a distant memory as the resonator held the bridge open. [475] The censer foot dimmed as the moon waned, its task complete, its weight now a gentle anchor in his palm. [495] He stood alone in the starlit signal station, the phone silent, the silence now a companion rather than a void. [515] The geography of loss was no longer a barren map but a landscape he could traverse, guided by the pulse of a bronze foot and the whisper of midnight. [544] He had built a bridge of sound, a reverse migration that returned her voice to him, and with it a fragile peace. [566] The station remained a sentinel of starlight, its broken hydraulics now irrelevant, its purpose fulfilled in the quiet triumph of a patchwork navigator who had learned to read the moon. [596] In the raw solace of that moment, he felt her presence not as a ghost but as a star that had finally found its way home. [622]</story>
