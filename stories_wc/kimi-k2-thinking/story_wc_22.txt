The gloom-hill coachman had never spoken of the war, but his eyes held the dust of a thousand battles. [19]
He drove his rickety coach along the old coast road, where the sea had retreated after the reef died, leaving behind a barren plain where nothing grew. [46]
In the satchel beside him rested a collection of dried seed pods, each one a memory of the gardens that had once bloomed before the fighting began. [73]
He spoke dead languages, the tongues of the old sea captains who had sailed the reef when it was alive, and the birds that nested in the cliffs still understood his whispers. [105]
At twilight, he would stop at the blooming jetty, a rickety pier over the still water where a few stubborn flowers clung to the rotting wood, their petals glowing in the dying light. [138]
It was there that he first heard the submerged concord, a hidden harmony beneath the silence, where the ghost of the reef sang through the calls of the seabirds. [167]
By understanding bird calls, he learned to map the cadence of warblers and the rhythm of gulls, each note a clue to where the soil still held a trace of life. [198]
The battlefield, a scarred stretch of earth where the last stand had been made, lay just beyond the jetty, its surface cracked and grey, refusing to accept any seed. [227]
He believed that if he could fertilize that ground with the seed pods and his own voice, the garden would reclaim the battlefield, turning blood-soaked dirt into a sea of flowers. [258]
He began by chanting in the tongue of the sunken city, a language that had not been heard since the reef's great death, and the birds fell silent, listening. [287]
Then, as the last syllable echoed across the water, he scattered the dried seed pods, letting them drift onto the battlefield like tiny ships sailing to a forgotten shore. [316]
The pods cracked open, releasing a fine dust that settled into the cracks, each particle a promise of renewal. [335]
He listened again to the birds, their calls now forming a pattern that told him where the soil was still warm, where the roots could find the faint pulse of the old reef. [368]
He stepped onto the battlefield, his boots sinking into the parched earth, and he sang a dirge in the language of the stone masons who had built the ancient seawalls. [398]
The sound of his voice carried over the cracked ground, and the dust stirred, as if the earth itself was listening. [419]
A single gull swooped down and alighted on his shoulder, its cry a series of sharp notes that he understood as a map of the hidden springs beneath the battlefield. [449]
He followed the gull's guidance, digging his fingers into the dry soil until he felt the faint moisture, the ghost of the reef's lifeblood still trickling through the limestone. [478]
There he planted the last of the seed pods, pressing them deep, and whispered a final blessing in the tongue of the forgotten monks who had once tended the reef. [508]
As twilight deepened, the stars emerged, and the narrow vastness of the jetty stretched before him, a thin line of wood against the infinite sea and sky. [535]
The gull took flight, and the other birds joined in a chorus that seemed to affirm the concord he had sensed, a hidden harmony linking the dead reef, the battlefield, and the nascent garden. [569]
In the weeks that followed, the seed pods sprouted, their green shoots pushing through the cracks, and the battlefield slowly began to soften, to breathe, to remember what it was to be a garden. [603]
The locals whispered that the coachman had woven a spell, but he knew it was simply the submerged concord, the quiet agreement between the living and the dead, finally given voice. [634]
Now, each twilight, he returns to the blooming jetty, listens to the birds, and adds a few more seed pods to the ever-expanding garden, letting the narrow vastness fill with colour. [665]
He speaks the dead languages still, but now they are lullabies for the seedlings, a reminder that even in the deepest loss, a quiet harmony can rise. [692]
The battlefield is no longer a scar; it is a living tapestry, woven from the threads of memory, song, and the stubborn will to grow. [717]
And the gloom-hill coachman, once a silent ferryman of the past, now tends a garden that reclaims the land, turning the narrow vastness into a horizon of hope. [745]
In the end, the garden does not erase the memory of the reef or the battlefield; it simply lets the living and the dead share the same breath, a submerged concord made visible. [778]
The coachman smiles, knowing that every seed pod he carries is a vow that the narrow vastness will be filled with life. [800]
