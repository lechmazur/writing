The headstone had my name etched in moss-slicked granite, but the dates were gibberish, yesterday bleeding into centuries. [18] I retreated to the ranger cabin, a cedar-shake shack where the wind howled through chinks like a bored oracle. [37] As a lucid dream chronicler, I'd spent decades recording visions that made more sense than my own biography. [55] Now even my memories wore costumes from wrong eras, and I couldn't tell if I was thirty or three hundred. [75] The birch bark scroll waited on the pine table, its edges curled like ancient fingers ready to scrawl preemptive grief. [95] My motivation remained stubborn: to distill chaos into narrative, even if the narrative was my own disintegration. [112] But tonight, something feral had infected my nostalgia, turning memory into something that bit back. [127] I found myself jealous of past selves who still believed time was a line, not a shattered mirror. [145] In the dream-logic that bled into waking, I learned to soar by forgetting which gravity applied to me. [163] The scroll drank my ink like a thirsty ghost, each symbol a anchor trying to moor fog. [180] I wrote of the grave, of the impossible dates, of the way my younger face smirked from courthouse photographs taken next year. [202] The feral nostalgia growled louder, showing me summers I'd never lived, a childhood in villages that burned before my birth. [222] My past selves multiplied, each one certain, and I hated them for their stupid, beautiful certainty. [238] The cabin walls breathed pine resin and old snow, and I wondered if I'd built this place or would build it a century ago. [262] Chronological confusion wasn't a symptom anymore; it was the terrain I navigated, a mountain range of when. [279] I gripped the birch bark and let the jealousy fuel me, a bitter coal that still burned hot enough to lift. [300] Outside, the stars rearranged themselves into constellations I'd named in dreams, and I stepped through the door without opening it. [320] The air held me like a question, and I soared upward, gravity's rules just another story I'd stopped believing. [339] Below, the cabin shrank to a toy, and I saw the graveyard from above, my headstone one dull tooth in a jaw of earth. [363] The feral nostalgia had chased me here, not to devour but to demand I write its true ending. [381] I understood then that my past selves weren't enemies but witnesses, each holding a shard of the story I'd forgotten to tell. [403] The scroll grew heavy with potential, and I carved words into it mid-air, the bark bleeding sap like ink. [425] I wrote: "The chronicler dies but the dreaming continues," and the letters glowed with the cold fire of lucid truth. [445] The jealousy drained away, replaced by the weary wonder of someone who has finally seen the pattern in the noise. [465] I descended not as a man but as a narrative, a story folding itself into the scroll's embrace. [483] The cabin welcomed me back with the scent of woodsmoke from a fire I hadn't lit yet. [500] Time settled into a new kind of rhythm, not linear but harmonic, a chord struck across infinite versions of now. [520] I rolled the scroll, its bark scraping my palms with the texture of forgotten forests and futures. [537] In the morning, I would return to the graveyard with fresh ink and older eyes, ready to carve the dates that made sense. [560] Until then, I would sleep, perchance to dream, and in dreaming, remember who I had never been. [577] The scroll knew the ending already, but it was polite enough to let me write it anyway. [594] Outside, the mountains held their breath, and somewhere between the peaks, my ghost was being born. [610] I smiled at the absurdity, the jaded wonder of a man who'd buried himself and found the soil fertile. [629] The birch bark scroll curled tighter around its secrets, and I let it, for some stories must be held before they're told. [651] In the space between heartbeats, I felt all my ages collide, and the impact wrote a new beginning. [669] The chronicler's work was never done, but at least the chaos had learned to sing in key. [686] I tucked the scroll beneath my pillow and lay down, letting the mountain's pulse lull me into the next chapter. [706] Tomorrow's grave would wait, but tonight's dream was already etching itself into bark, into bone, into the permanent now. [725] The chronicler sleeps, dreams soar, the scroll remembers what we were never supposed to forget. [740]
