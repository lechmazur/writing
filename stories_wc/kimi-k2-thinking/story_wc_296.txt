The magic trick had failed. [5]
The orchard vortex still swirled at the heart of the cursed lake, its twisted branches churning like a maelstrom of dead fruit and rot. [29]
The druid, guarded and silent, watched the water hiss as the failed spell's remnants fizzled into the dark. [47]
His purpose was clear: to discover what mirrors don't show, the truth buried beneath the lake's deceiving surface. [65]
He possessed an old gift; he could find lost things, be they keys, memories, or the faint echo of a confession. [86]
Yet the confession he sought was frozen, locked in a block of ice that floated at the vortex's core. [105]
The ice shimmered with a malevolent light, a frozen confession that had been trapped for centuries. [121]
The druid's first attempt--a dazzling magic trick meant to melt the ice with a burst of flame--had failed. [139]
Now he stood in the aftermath, the taste of ash on his tongue, the lake's curse pressing heavier than before. [159]
His hand slipped into his pouch, fingers brushing against the flesh-eating plant seed he had carried for such a moment. [179]
The seed was a last resort, a hungry thing that devoured curses and grew into a vine of scarlet thorns. [199]
He knelt at the water's edge, the vortex's swirl pulling at the hem of his cloak like a greedy hand. [219]
The druid breathed deeply, centering himself in a warlike serenity, calm as a blade before the strike. [236]
He began to chant, his voice low, sending out the first expanding circle of silver light across the water. [255]
The circle grew, a ripple of energy that widened, touching the vortex's edge and causing the orchard trees to shiver. [275]
A second circle followed, then a third, each larger than the last, pressing against the ice with a steady hum. [295]
The ice groaned, hairline fractures spidering across its surface as the expanding circles forced it to unbend its frozen grip. [315]
He felt the confession stir beneath, a memory clawing at its icy prison, seeking release. [330]
With a final, resonant note, the druid planted the flesh-eating seed into a crack at his feet. [347]
The seed sprouted instantly, roots sinking into the ice, a crimson vine winding upward with a ravenous hunger. [365]
It fed on the curse, the frozen confession tasting of bitter betrayal, and the ice began to melt away. [384]
As the last of the ice dissolved, the confession rose like a ghost, its voice a whisper of truth. [403]
The druid saw his own face reflected not in water, but in the memory's surface, and he understood. [421]
Mirrors only show the outer shell; they hide the scars that lie beneath, the ones he had lost. [439]
The confession revealed a truth he had buried: his own hand had once cast the curse, out of fear. [458]
Now, with the curse unbent, the vortex slowed, its swirling orchard settling into a quiet, somber grove. [475]
The druid stood, his guarded heart lighter, though the warlike serenity remained, a reminder of the cost. [492]
He had found the lost thing--his own forgotten guilt--and freed it from its frozen prison. [507]
The flesh-eating plant, its hunger sated, wilted into a cluster of harmless red berries, a new beginning. [524]
The lake's surface smoothed, reflecting the sky once more, though the druid knew some truths remain hidden from mirrors. [543]
He turned away, the seed now a memory, his purpose fulfilled, yet the warlike serenity lingered like a shield. [562]
In the silence, the orchard whispered secrets only the druid could hear, a reminder that some things must be unbent. [582]
He walked into the dawn, the weight of his confession dissolved, ready to guard the world once more. [600]
The druid's journey was far from over, but now he carried the truth like a lantern in the dark. [619]
