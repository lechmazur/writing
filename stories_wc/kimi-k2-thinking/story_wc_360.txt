The topaz workshop glowed beneath a sky where stars had begun to vanish. [13]
Cassian, the cryptic letterpress operator, fed a sheet of vellum into the iron press. [27]
His fingers moved with the precision of a clockmaker, yet his eyes held a restless turbulence. [43]
A shard of halo fragment lay on the ink-stained bench, pulsing like a captured heartbeat. [58]
He believed it could transpose empathy, shifting feeling from one soul to another like a algebraic equation. [75]
Tonight, between the vanishing stars, he intended to solve the mathematics of emotion. [88]
His habit of borrowing personalities gave him a thousand masks, each a variable in his experiment. [104]
He fed the halo fragment into the press, letting its light bleed into the lead type. [120]
The machine groaned, and the first sheet emerged, covered in glyphs that seemed to shift when stared at. [138]
Cassian handed the page to a waiting client, a mathematician who had lost his sense of empathy. [155]
The mathematician read the ambiguous lines, felt his own emotions dislocate, and stumbled backward. [169]
Cassian watched the transposed empathy take root, the man's sorrow now a variable in his notebook. [185]
He recorded the shift as a differential equation, mapping sorrow onto joy, guilt onto curiosity. [200]
The workshop's topaz walls reflected the faint starlight, casting copper shadows across the floor. [214]
Between each pulse of the halo fragment, a star above winked out, as if in sympathy. [230]
Cassian borrowed the mathematician's analytical mind for a moment, feeling numbers crowd his thoughts. [244]
The borrowed personality sharpened his focus, yet also injected a cold disdain for sentiment. [258]
He needed to disorient the next subject, to strip away pretense and expose raw feeling. [273]
Deliberate ambiguity was his tool; each line of type a question mark, each spacing a pause. [289]
He printed a second sheet, this one for a poet who had never known grief. [304]
As the poet read, the words melted into sound, disorienting her sense of time. [318]
Her borrowed joy surged into Cassian, a bright wave that threatened to drown his calculations. [333]
He steadied himself, letting the borrowed personalities clash like cymbals, each a data point. [347]
The mathematics of emotion, he believed, lay in the friction between contrasting selves. [360]
He recorded the poet's euphoric pulse as a sine wave, the mathematician's despair as a damped oscillation. [377]
The halo fragment flickered, its light now fractured, projecting a mosaic of shadows onto the ceiling. [393]
Cassian felt the transposed empathy reversing; the poet's joy seeped back into the page, leaving him hollow. [410]
He realized the experiment was flawed; emotion could not be solved like a linear equation. [425]
Yet the disorientation had revealed a truth: empathy flowed in both directions, a bidirectional current. [440]
The topaz walls seemed to pulse with that current, reflecting the vanishing stars above. [454]
Cassian decided to embrace the turbulence, to let each borrowed personality teach him its own calculus. [470]
He would continue printing, each sheet a deliberate ambiguity, each word a variable in the grand equation. [487]
The halo fragment dimmed, its energy spent, but its ghost lingered in the ink. [501]
Under the stars that remained, Cassian set a fresh sheet, ready to borrow the next soul. [517]
His motivation remained unchanged: to understand the mathematics of emotion, even if the numbers never added up. [534]
Between the vanishing stars, the topaz workshop stood as a lighthouse of lucid turbulence. [548]
Cassian smiled, his many faces blending into one, each a note in a dissonant chord. [563]
The press clanked, the halo fragment whispered, and the night sky held its breath. [577]
In that silence, Cassian felt the mathematics of emotion reveal itself--not as a formula, but as a living, breathing flux. [597]
He recorded the moment in his notebook, a single line: 'Empathy = DeltaSelf / DeltaOther'. [612]
Then the stars vanished completely, and the workshop was bathed in the pure darkness of a new beginning. [630]
Cassian let the borrowed personalities fade, returning to his own, still uncertain, still searching. [644]
The topaz walls kept their glow, a faint echo of the halo fragment's light. [658]
He knew the next print would be more ambiguous, more disorienting, more true. [671]
For now, the mathematics of emotion remained an open problem, and Cassian was its most devoted student. [688]
The topaz workshop, under the fading stars, hummed with the quiet promise of a thousand unresolved equations. [705]
Cassian closed his eyes, borrowing a final personality--that of a star that had vanished, serene and distant. [722]
When he opened them again, the world was a matrix of light and shadow, each cell a feeling. [740]
