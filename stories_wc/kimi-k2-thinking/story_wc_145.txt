The outpost groaned against the ice wind. [6]
Rusted flanks of corrugated metal hunched beside a frozen lake that had forgotten its own shape. [22]
Kael ran fingers along a windowpane, tracing condensation patterns on glass. [11] [33]
He waited for the falcon. [5] [38]
It returned at dusk, a dark comma against the white page of sky. [11] [49]
The bird landed on his wrist, offering no message but a single feather. [11] [60]
"'Subtle,' Kael muttered, dry wit emerging like frost on iron. [8] [68]
He'd been stationed here three seasons, mapping what others called the end of the world. [13] [81]
But Kael charted beginnings. [4] [85]
He tracked beginnings. [3] [88]
To find where the rivers began, he'd followed their silence upstream through dead water and stone. [15] [103]
This outpost marked the last cartographer's source. [6] [109]
Beyond lay only rumor and the phrasebook dog-ear he'd carried since apprenticeship. [11] [120]
The page marked 'Water-Tongue: Dialects of Thaw' was worn soft as flannel. [12] [132]
Kael turned from the window, carrying the falcon's feather to his worktable. [11] [143]
His maps showed seven rivers converging somewhere beyond the frozen lake. [10] [153]
All data ended at this rusted coordinate. [6] [159]
The condensation patterns had shown him something new tonight. [8] [167]
A spiral, then a line, then a dot. [7] [174]
The method was old, older than the outpost. [7] [181]
Water always wrote its own cartography if you knew how to read it. [11] [192]
He'd learned the technique from a polyglot who'd marked his phrasebook with dog-ears at every word for 'source'. [18] [210]
The old man had been subtly confident in a way Kael now recognized. [12] [222]
"'When the falcon returns,' he'd said, 'it will not bring news'. [10] [232]
'It will herald convergence'. [4] [236]
Kael opened the outpost's metal door, letting the bird fly free into the dark. [13] [249]
The feather he placed on the map, aligning its spine with the phantom rivers. [12] [261]
His finger found the spot where all seven blue lines would meet if they hadn't frozen mid-flow. [17] [278]
The singular convergence. [3] [281]
Not of rivers, but of their absence. [6] [287]
To find where the rivers began, one had to understand where they had chosen not to end. [16] [303]
The phrasebook dog-ear fluttered in the draft. [7] [310]
Kael consulted it, though he knew the words by heart. [9] [319]
'Nishan,' he whispered, the Thaw-tongue word for 'unsprung'. [8] [327]
The falcon's cry echoed back from the ice, distant and approving. [9] [336]
Morning would bring the melt crews. [5] [341]
They would find him gone, the maps redrawn. [7] [348]
Kael packed only the phrasebook and the feather. [7] [355]
He left a note on the rusted wall, written in condensation script. [11] [366]
'Follow the feather,' it read. [4] [370]
'The rivers begin where they remember they are water'. [9] [379]
Outside, the lake breathed slowly, its surface a mirror of the worrying tranquility. [11] [390]
Kael walked onto the ice, his steps confident in a way that suggested knowledge, not pride. [14] [404]
The dog-eared page in his coat pocket warmed against his chest. [11] [415]
He was subtly confident that the ice would hold, that the singular convergence awaited. [13] [428]
The condensation patterns had shown him the way forward, not just the way things were. [13] [441]
After the falcon returned, the world had shifted. [7] [448]
Not with violence, but with the quiet certainty of water finding its level. [11] [459]
To find where the rivers begin was to accept that some sources were hidden in plain sight. [16] [475]
Kael moved toward the center of the frozen lake, where the feather's shadow pointed. [14] [489]
The rusted outpost creaked behind him, a comma in its own sentence of abandonment. [11] [500]
Under the ice, seven currents stirred. [6] [506]
They had never stopped. [4] [510]
Only waited. [2] [512]
And now they heralded the thaw. [6] [518]
Kael knelt, pressing his palm to the glassy surface. [9] [527]
The ice whispered back in seven languages. [7] [534]
He understood them all. [4] [538]
The phrasebook had taught him translation was just listening with different ears. [11] [549]
The singular convergence pulsed beneath his hand. [6] [555]
To find where the rivers begin, you must become the place they converge. [14] [569]
The falcon circled once, then dove toward him. [8] [577]
It did not slow. [4] [581]
Kael did not flinch. [4] [585]
The bird passed through him like an idea through silence. [9] [594]
Where it had been, the ice began to weep. [9] [603]
A single crack raced toward the outpost. [7] [610]
Condensation patterns on Kael's palm matched the one he'd traced on glass. [11] [621]
He was the map now. [4] [625]
The phrasebook dog-ear fluttered free, landing on the widening fissure. [10] [635]
It heralded the river's voice. [5] [640]
To find where the rivers begin is to become the source. [11] [651]
Kael stepped into the water. [5] [656]
Seven rivers flowed out, each bearing a single word: Nishan. [10] [666]
After the falcon returns, maps must be rewritten by those who know endings are beginnings reversed. [14] [680]
