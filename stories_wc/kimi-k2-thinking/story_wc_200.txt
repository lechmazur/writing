<story>Kael had been collecting lost souls so long that they'd misplaced their own. [10] Each morning, in the hush of a hidden sunrise—those forty-seven seconds when the sun remained trapped below the horizon but its light already stained the clouds—they descended into Echo Gorge. [28] The gorge was a throat of stone that swallowed sound and regurgitated memory. [10] Kael carried the misaligned harp, its frame twisted by a century of humidity and grief. [11] The strings were tuned to discord, because only distorted notes could shake loose the spectral confessions that clung to the canyon walls like mist. [18] The harp's striker was a crocodile's tooth, yellowed and chipped, a gift from a ghost who claimed it had once belonged to the beast that devoured her. [22] She'd said the tooth remembered the shape of finality. [7] Kael was modestly fearless, not immune to terror but practiced in moving through it as one moves through rain. [15] They pursued the whispers that echoed between the rocks, seeking one particular voice among thousands. [12] Five years ago, they'd collected a child's soul but left her laughter behind, trapped in the moment before death. [15] Now that laughter haunted the gorge, not as joy but as a wound that refused to close. [14] The healing of souls was Kael's purpose, but they'd forgotten how to integrate their own fragments. [13] The harp's first note screamed against the morning silence, a sound like breaking glass and forgiveness. [12] Echo Gorge caught the note and threw it back a thousand times, each echo thinner and more truthful. [14] From the cliffs, the spectral confessions began to unspool. [7] A miner who'd died in a collapse confessed he'd stolen his partner's gold. [11] A widow admitted she'd never loved her husband, only his absence. [10] The confessions poured out, desperate for the absolution that only exposure could provide. [11] But the laughter remained elusive, hiding between the notes. [7] Kael adjusted the crocodile's tooth striker, angling it to pluck the bass string with a sideways scrape that produced a sound like a sob turning inside-out. [21] The hidden sunrise deepened from bruised purple to arterial gold. [8] In that luminous ache between darkness and day, Kael felt the child's spirit draw near. [13] She'd been seven, her death a stupid accident of ice and velocity. [10] The soul collector had done their job efficiently, containing her essence in a silver vial. [12] But children don't travel lightly. [4] Their joy sticks to places, to objects, to the air itself. [9] Kael had left her laughter behind because it hurt too much to contain. [11] Now they pursued it through the distorted notes, modestly fearless in the face of their own failure. [15] The harp shrieked again, and the crocodile's tooth bit into the string with a sound like teeth on bone. [15] Echo Gorge convulsed with memory. [4] The laughter came then—not as Kael remembered it, bright and bell-like, but as something fractured, a sound made of broken mirrors and stitched-together apologies. [20] It spilled from the canyon walls, a confession of its own. [9] That laughter had witnessed its own ending and survived as something new. [10] Kael stood in the hush of the hidden sunrise, the sky now fully born, and understood. [14] Healing wasn't about restoring what was lost, but integrating the broken pieces into something that could laugh anyway. [16] The crocodile's tooth fell from the harp, spent. [6] Kael caught it, and for the first time in years, they laughed too—a sound as misaligned and honest as the harp. [19] The spectral confessions around them quieted, not silenced, but settled. [7] The lost soul collector had found one piece of themselves in the pursuit of another's joy. [14] Echo Gorge held the new silence differently now, less like a grave and more like a throat preparing to sing. [16] As Kael climbed out of the canyon, the day's proper light found them. [11] They placed the crocodile's tooth in their pocket next to the silver vial that held the child's soul. [16] The two objects clicked together, a hollow sound that promised integration. [9] Kael would return tomorrow. [3] There were always more confessions to collect, more laughter to liberate from the places where it had become trapped. [15] But today, the modestly fearless collector had learned that pursuing healing through the distorted notes of a misaligned harp required one final confession: that they were also lost, also worthy of retrieval. [27] The hush of the hidden sunrise had given them that gift. [10] And the luminous ache that followed—the pain of becoming whole—was the most honest song Echo Gorge had ever sung. [16]</story>
