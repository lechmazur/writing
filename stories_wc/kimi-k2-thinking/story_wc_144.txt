Miren ran her fingers over the hummingbird drone's shattered wing casing, each crack a map she couldn't see but could feel. [21]
Her repair shop huddled against the mist-coated rail depot like a forgotten promise, tools hanging from ceiling hooks in a symphony of metal she knew by weight alone. [49]
The artificial hummingbird had arrived couriered from the capital, its iridescent feathers dulled by impact, its internal gyroscope screaming silent distress through corrupted data streams. [74]
She was blind from birth, but Miren had learned to oversee her workshop through the language of vibration, temperature, and the subtle refraction of light through water features she kept scattered across her workbench. [108]
A shallow basin of mercury caught the depot's dim gaslight, bending it into patterns her trained mind could translate into circuitry, into fault lines, into truth. [134]
Tonight, the air tasted of salt and engine oil, a ship's anchor lifting somewhere beyond the depot's eastern platform where the tracks gave way to harbor. [160]
The maiden voyage of the research vessel *Prospect* sent ripples of excitement through the city, but Miren felt only the pressure of decoding feedback into direction before the drone's owner arrived at dawn. [193]
She held the hummingbird's chassis beneath a suspended glass sphere filled with distilled water, watching how the workshop's single lantern fractured into spectral lines across its damaged processors. [221]
The method revealed what her fingers could not: a hairline fracture in the navigation crystal, scattering the drone's internal compass like a star chart torn along its folds. [249]
Miren's apprentice, a quiet boy named Kael, hovered near the doorway, his breathing shallow with the weight of observation. [268]
'Bring me the platinum patch,' she murmured, her voice carrying magnetic calm that drew projects toward her like filings to a magnet. [289]
She worked through the night, her fingers dancing with solder and micro-crystals, each connection a prayer whispered into the machine. [308]
The depot's mist pressed against the windows, and the horn of the *Prospect* sounded—three long blasts that told Miren the anchor had cleared the harbor floor. [334]
The sound became a deadline echoing in her ribs, but her hands remained steady. [348]
She placed the repaired drone in a test chamber, a cylinder of flowing water where light carved holographic pathways. [366]
Activating it, she listened to the pitch of its wings—fifty beats per second, then sixty, stabilizing at the perfect harmonic resonance. [387]
The feedback loop, once a chaotic scream, now resolved into clear coordinates, each pulse a compass point singing true north. [407]
Kael exhaled in wonder as the drone hovered perfectly, its wings catching dawn light through high windows. [423]
Miren smiled, her blind eyes reflecting nothing yet seeing everything through the machine's restored grace. [438]
The drone's owner, a naval cartographer, arrived as promised, his urgent voice softening at the clear telemetry chirp. [455]
'It will guide your expedition,' Miren said, her fingertips lingering on the drone's cool metal body. [469]
The cartographer paid in silver coins, each clink a weight of trust. [479]
When he left, Kael finally spoke: 'How did you know where to patch it?' [493]
Miren moved to the window, where depot mist curled around tracks, pointing where the *Prospect* had vanished. [510]
'The same way that captain knew,' she said, 'by listening to what was broken until it told me which way was true.' [532]
Kael watched his breath steam against cold glass, understanding settling like the depot's persistent mist. [546]
Miren returned to her bench, already feeling the next broken thing enter her orbit, her blindness no barrier to the map of light and sound she navigated by. [574]
The *Prospect*'s engines droned toward open sea, but here, true navigation belonged to those who heard silence speak. [593]
She gathered the water features—crystal vials, mercury pools, a prism that hung from the ceiling on a single thread—and arranged them for the next examination. [618]
The test chamber hummed with residual energy, water flowing in perpetual loop, refracting light into patterns only she could read. [638]
Kael handed her a cloth, and she wiped tools methodically, each motion a ritual resetting space between commissions. [655]
'Master,' Kael asked quietly, 'will you teach me to see as you do?' [668]
Miren turned toward him, unseeing eyes catching prism light that scattered a rainbow across his face. [684]
'I don't see,' she corrected, 'I interpret. The light tells stories, but only if you listen for what distorts it.' [704]
She lifted a glass of water, demonstrating how a single bubble could bend a beam into a map. [720]
