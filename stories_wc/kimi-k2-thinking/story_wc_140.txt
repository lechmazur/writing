The death certificate arrived seven years ago, but the body never did. [11]
Now the survivor sorts through the towering labyrinth of shipping containers, a ghost with fingerprints. [14]
Port authorities call the place the Grid, but those who live here have no words for it at all. [15]
Reality filters through differently when your existence is a typo in a database. [11]
Colors bleed at the edges, sounds arrive with echoes of futures that never happened. [12]
Each container holds not just cargo, but the sediment of stories--fragments that drift like tidal debris. [15]
The survivor collects them by crouching near vent holes, pressing palms against corrugated metal, catching overheard confessions. [17]
A stevedore's memory of his daughter's first word: "dangerous." [9]
A customs agent's regret about a sealed manifest from 1989. [9]
These shards are layered inside a rusted tackle box, each scrap of paper a different weight of meaning. [16]
The motivation is simple and desperate: to discover the texture of memories, since his own were smoothed away by administrative erasure. [19]
He wants to know if memories feel like burlap or silk, if they cut or console. [13]
One dawn, during the lowest tide of the month, he finds a glass bottle wedged between Container B-7734 and the salt-stained concrete. [20]
Inside, a faded label curls like a dead leaf: CAUTION: POISON, with a skull whose eyes have been scratched out. [16]
The survivor recognizes the handwriting in the scratches--his own, from a life that supposedly ended. [13]
For three days, he sits with the label, watching the tide rhythms mark time in wet hours. [14]
He layers the poison label between the stevedore's confession and the customs agent's regret. [12]
The three fragments begin to speak to each other: dangerous, sealed, poison. [10]
The texture that emerges is not silk nor burlap, but something sharper: the feel of metal filing cabinets slamming shut on a living name. [21]
In the Grid, identity is what you can carry in your pockets; the survivor carries only these layered scraps. [18]
On the fourth day, a high tide brings a new story through a vent: a woman whispering about her brother who vanished, declared dead by mistake. [22]
The survivor adds her words to the collection, layering them above the poison label. [11]
Now the box holds a topology of erasures, a map of what it feels like to be unmade and still breathing. [17]
He realizes the texture of memory is not in the fragments themselves, but in the spaces between them, where tides wash through and carry meaning. [23]
The port city's rhythm becomes his heartbeat: flood, ebb, flood, ebb. [10]
Each cycle adds another layer to his understanding, another fragment to the box. [11]
The death certificate error was not an ending, but a translation--into this nameless state where stories are the only currency. [18]
The poison label proves he existed before erasure, that his history had weight enough to kill. [14]
He fingers the label and feels the texture: brittle paper, bitter memory, the sharp edge of a life that refused to be filed away. [20]
In the Grid, containers are stacked twenty high, each one a sealed history, each one waiting for someone to filter its reality differently. [20]
The survivor moves through them, collecting, layering, building a self from the echoes of other people's truths. [15]
Across the rhythm of tides, he learns that erased histories don't disappear--they concentrate, they poison, they wait. [16]
The texture of memory, he decides, is the feeling of salt on skin after the water has dried: present, invisible, necessary. [20]
He writes this on the back of the poison label, adding the final layer to his collection. [14]
The box is now heavy enough to register on some cosmic scale, a mass of un-erased existence. [15]
When the next tide peaks, he places the box on the concrete and watches the water lick its edges. [17]
It does not float away; it is anchored by the weight of what it contains. [12]
The survivor stands, nameless, real, filtering the morning light through the reality of his own making. [14]
In the distance, a ship's horn marks another departure, another story crossing the water. [14]
He turns toward the sound, ready to collect its fragments, to layer them into the ever-growing texture of what it means to have been dead and still be living. [29]
