Kael, the thoughtful gravestone carver, worked in the ancient greenhouse when the first monarchs arrived, their orange wings flickering like candle flames against the fading glass. [26]
By day he carved memory into stone, but at dusk he became fiercely meditative, tracing patterns in the air that only the migrating butterflies seemed to understand. [50]
His grandmother's ghost appeared on the third evening, her translucent fingers pointing to the woven ribbon roll he kept beneath the potting bench. [72]
"You never learned to read the ribbons properly," she said, her voice like wind through broken panes. [88]
She had been the greenhouse keeper before him, and death had not stopped her mentorship—this was their family's spectral tradition, passed down like a favorite poem. [115]
Kael unrolled the ribbons, each strand embroidered with verses his family had traded at dinner tables for generations. [131]
The custom was simple: before the evening meal, each person offered a favorite poem, and the words were woven into the fabric of remembrance. [154]
Tonight, he needed to retrace his grandmother's final path through the glass corridors, following the ribbon's coded threads. [172]
A month ago, the river had taken seven villagers, and Kael had been commissioned to carve a single stone for them all. [194]
He wanted to discover the shape of collective grief, not just individual loss—that thundering calm that holds a community together when words fail. [217]
The greenhouse at dusk became his workshop, where stone dust settled on orchid leaves and chisels rang against silence. [236]
His grandmother's ghost led him past the corpse flower, its stench of decay a reminder that beauty and rot share the same soil. [258]
"Grief isn't a line," she whispered, "it's a spiral. You must retrace the same wounds to find the pattern." [275]
Kael touched the woven ribbon roll, feeling the raised stitches of a poem his mother had contributed: "Do not stand at my grave and weep." [298]
He had been carving generic angels and lambs, but the spectral mentorship demanded more. [311]
Across the butterfly migration, he watched them cluster on the glass, their collective weight bending light into something like a prayer. [333]
The monarchs stayed for six weeks, and each evening Kael retraced another loop of his grandmother's path, mapping the greenhouse in memory. [355]
He discovered that certain poems appeared more frequently on the ribbons—Dickinson's hope, Neruda's sorrow, the village's own anonymous verses about the river. [377]
These repeated lines formed a topography of communal mourning, a landscape he could finally see. [390]
One evening, his daughter found him there, the ribbon roll spread between them like a river. [406]
She recited a poem she'd learned at school, something about wings and transformation, and Kael wove it into a fresh ribbon without speaking. [430]
The family custom continued, even here among the dying light and migrating souls. [443]
His grandmother's ghost approved, her form growing brighter as the days shortened. [455]
"The shape you seek," she said on the final night of the migration, "is not in the stone but in the spaces between the words." [480]
Kael understood then that collective grief was a woven thing—tight in some places, loose in others, holding its form through tension and release. [503]
He began carving the memorial stone with this new knowledge, chiseling not seven names in a row, but a spiral of text that wound inward like a ribbon. [530]
The words were fragments of all the poems his family had traded, the ones the community had offered, the verses the spectral mentorship had taught him to read. [557]
When the last monarchs departed, their absence left a thundering calm in the greenhouse, a silence so complete it felt like stone. [578]
Kael traced their empty flight paths one final time, his fingers moving fiercely meditative through the air where they had been. [598]
The woven ribbon roll was now a map of that shape, a topography of how grief could be held together. [616]
He placed the finished stone by the river, and villagers came to touch the spiraled words, recognizing fragments of their own dinner-table poems. [639]
His grandmother's ghost kissed his forehead, her cold breath smelling of orchids. [651]
The mentorship was complete, but Kael knew he would return to the greenhouse next migration, because grief, like the butterflies, always finds its way home. [676]
