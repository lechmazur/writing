Elias had been climbing the staircase for what might have been seven days or seven centuries. [16]
The steps were perfect stone, each riser mathematically precise to the nanometer, yet the architecture violated every law of thermodynamics by rising forever without energy input. [42]
This perpetual motion didn't liberate him; it bound him. [51]
He was a grim optimist, the kind of man who could catalog every way this infinite prison would kill him while still believing the next landing held salvation. [79]
In his breast pocket, a pair of dice clicked against his ribs—one pristine, one chipped along the three-face from a fall he'd never witnessed. [103]
He'd tried mapping the staircase early on, marking steps with blood and tears, but the geometry healed itself by morning that never came. [126]
Timeframe: None—the sun neither rose nor set, and his watch had frozen at 11:47, the exact moment he'd accepted the wager that landed him here. [151]
The wager had been simple: beat the house at its own game, capture the texture of a missed opportunity so completely that regret itself would dissolve. [177]
He'd missed his daughter's final breath for a venture capital meeting, and the texture of that mistake felt like these cold, unyielding steps. [200]
So he walked, and he calculated. [206]
Through mathematical proofs, he demonstrated that the staircase must contain a rupture—a point where infinity folded back on itself, where the endless loop could be broken. [232]
His notebooks, scavenged paper covered in frantic theorems, proved that perpetual motion required perfect symmetry, and perfect symmetry always concealed one fatal flaw. [255]
The dice were his divining rods. [261]
Every hundred steps, he would roll them, letting probability guide his tired legs toward the mathematical singularity his proofs promised. [281]
The pristine die landed with cosmic indifference, but the chipped one—that was his key. [295]
Its imperfection created a bias, a 0.003% favor toward the four, which his calculations showed was just enough to navigate toward asymmetry in an infinite system. [321]
He'd spent eternity learning to read the micro-variations in its clatter against stone. [334]
Balancedly daring, he moved—never rushing, never resting, always one hand on the bannister, always counting. [349]
To rush was to exhaust himself into madness; to rest was to become part of the architecture, another frozen statue on a landing. [372]
One day, or night, or moment, the dice clattered and both came up sixes—which his proofs had declared impossible in this particular infinite sequence. [396]
The staircase shuddered, and a step three paces ahead flickered like a corrupted pixel in reality's fabric. [413]
The rupture. [415]
Elias approached it balancedly daring, his calculations racing ahead of his heartbeat. [427]
The texture of the missed opportunity hung in that glitch—that he could step through and return to a hospital corridor, smell antiseptic instead of stone, feel his daughter's hand go limp with proper finality instead of this endless almost. [466]
But his proofs warned him: the rupture was a one-way passage, and passing through would collapse the waveform of every what-if he'd constructed here. [490]
The grim optimist knelt at the edge of the impossible step. [501]
He rolled the dice one final time, knowing the chipped one would decide. [514]
It tumbled, caught the light of no sun, and landed on three—the face that should have been worn away. [533]
The universe waited. [536]
Elias stood, balanced between capture and release, and understood that the texture of a missed opportunity wasn't something you escaped—it was something you carried, imperfect and weighted, like a pair of dice in an infinite climb. [572]
He stepped forward, not through the rupture, but onto the next solid step, letting the glitch fade behind him. [591]
The dice in his pocket settled into a new rhythm, their weight a constant reminder of his choice. [607]
The staircase continued, and so did he. [614]
