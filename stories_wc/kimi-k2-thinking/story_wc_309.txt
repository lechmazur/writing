<story>Vorrin had spent twelve years unbinding wonder from stone in the Refactory's gloom, his hands growing more calloused as his magic grew more numb. [18] The great automation had begun when creativity became just another measurable output, spells reduced to assembly-line incantations that anyone could chant. [29] He was an underachieving mage in an age that no longer tolerated underachievement, his modest talents for delicate work now a liability rather than a virtue. [41] His final assignment was the garden folly keystone from the Frostgate estate, a decorative ruin that had once accommodated impossibilities within its whimsical arches. [57] The keystone was said to hold a lingering luminance, the last breath of organic magic before the new systems scrubbed everything clean and predictable. [74] Vorrin's motivation was simple: to find the sacred in the simple before the world forgot what simple even meant. [87] They told him the keystone had already been transported to the icebound spire above the clouds, the new repository for all decommissioned magical artifacts. [106] The spire was a needle of frozen crystal piercing the stratopause, where the last wild magics were left to die in the cold. [123] To reach it, one could not simply fly or teleport—those methods were for the efficient, the automated, the sure. [139] Vorrin would have to mist walk, the old way, dissolving his coherence into the morning fog and letting it carry him upward on breaths of evaporating memory. [161] He stood at the mountain's base before dawn, watching the valley fill with mist that moved like a living thing, not yet programmed. [180] The unstrap sequence had been practiced a thousand times: identify the binding sigils, speak the release words, detach the keystone without cracking its essence. [202] But this was different—this keystone was the last, and it had been anchored with something older than the Refactory's protocols. [222] Vorrin let his body loosen, his consciousness thinning until he could slip between water droplets, becoming part of the mist's slow climb. [242] Mist walking was the perfect method for an underachiever: it required patience over power, surrender over control, listening over shouting. [264] The icebound spire materialized gradually, its base hidden in cloud, its peak catching the first silver light of a sun that seemed dimmer than memory. [287] Vorrin solidified on a balcony of frost, his breath crystallizing instantly in air that accommodated impossibilities by keeping them perfectly preserved. [309] Inside, the repository was a cathedral of dying light, thousands of keystones and fetishes stacked in neat rows, their magic leaching into the cold. [334] The garden folly keystone sat alone on a pedestal at the very top, not yet catalogued, not yet scrubbed. [354] It was smaller than he'd imagined, a plain stone carved with a single ivy leaf, its brilliance dimmed but not extinguished. [376] Vorrin reached to unstrap it from its frozen base, but his fingers found no sigils, no locks, no mechanized bindings. [398] Instead, the stone simply waited, its lingering luminance pulsing with a question. [414] The Refactory had sent him to retrieve it, to bring it back for final processing, but Vorrin understood now why they'd chosen him—the underachiever, the one who still fumbled with meaning. [447] In a world where creativity got automated, only the inefficient still recognized inefficiency's value. [466] He could unstrap it easily, cup it in his hands, descend, and collect his final pension. [482] Or he could accommodate the impossibility: leave it here, let it continue, let one last piece of unpredictable magic persist where the algorithms couldn't reach. [509] The spire above the clouds was a brilliant dimness, both wondrous and terminal, a place where the old and new worlds met and canceled each other out. [535] Vorrin's decision was not a grand rebellion but a quiet refusal, the kind that sacred simplicity demanded. [556] He did not unstrap the keystone. [563] He sat beside it, his own light dimming to match its rhythm, and became part of the mist that would forever climb this impossible height. [591] The Refactory's automated sentinels would come eventually, their perfect efficiency finding this one last imperfection. [625] But inefficiency had its own gravity, its own slow orbit that no algorithm could predict or erase. [649] Vorrin smiled, feeling the garden folly keystone warm against his side, its lingering luminance now his own. [675] In the brilliant dimness of the spire, he had found what he sought—the sacred in the simple, the magic in the merely possible. [704]</story>
