The swamp breathed in time with the moon, a low, wet sigh that carried the scent of salt and sorrow. [20]
I paddled deeper into the mangrove labyrinth, each stroke a question I was afraid to answer. [36]
The singing spirits hovered above the water, their voices like wind chimes made of broken glass and memory. [54]
They were the ones who had never left, who had waited for the apology that my tongue could not shape. [74]
The cryptic medium waited on a gnarled root, her eyes the color of a storm about to break. [92]
She called herself Mira, but the spirits called her 'the one who reads the breath of the dead.' [110]
In her lap rested a shard of stone, a gargoyle's rainspout that had broken off during the last hurricane. [129]
She said it healed in moonlight, that the stone drank the silver glow and turned wounds into whispers. [147]
I had brought the unsent letters, a bundle of ink and grief tied with a frayed ribbon. [164]
Each page was a moment before deciding, a crossroads captured in cursive, never mailed, never burned. [180]
Mira took the bundle without a word and held it up to the moonlight. [194]
The shard began to glow, and the letters trembled as if the words wanted to escape. [210]
She placed the shard on the wet bark of a mangrove and traced a pattern with her finger. [228]
Water condensed on the window of her tiny boat, and she breathed a message onto the glass. [245]
The words formed in the fog: 'The apology is not in the speaking, but in the listening.' [262]
I stared at the condensation, the fierce tenderness of the message cutting through my denial. [277]
Mira's voice was a low chant, and the spirits responded with a chorus of ancient names. [293]
She told me to evoke the moment before the decision, to pull it from the water like a fish. [312]
I knelt beside the shard, its silver light now a bridge between the living and the gone. [329]
My fingers brushed the stone, and I felt the unsent letters flutter inside my chest. [344]
The singing spirits swirled around us, their song a fierce tenderness that cradled my rage. [359]
They sang of the time before the argument, before the silence that had sealed the letters. [375]
In that space where the apology waited unspoken, the water held the shape of my sister's face. [392]
She had died in the storm, the same storm that had broken the gargoyle, the same storm that had left me silent. [414]
The shard pulsed in my palm, and the wound I had carried since that night began to close. [432]
Mira whispered that the healing would only last until sunrise, that I must choose before the light returned. [450]
The spirits sang louder, their voices urging me to read the letters aloud, to let the words become the apology. [470]
I opened the first page, and the ink shimmered in the moonlight, each letter a tiny star. [487]
The words were my own, yet they felt foreign, as if written by a stranger who had loved her more. [507]
I read them to the water, to the shard, to the singing spirits who had known her song. [525]
The apology rose from my throat, unplanned, raw, a sound that split the night like a cracked bell. [543]
The singing spirits caught it and turned it into a chorus that echoed through the mangrove labyrinth. [560]
Mira smiled, a rare, fierce tenderness that told me I had found the moment before deciding. [576]
The shard's light faded as the moon dipped below the canopy, its healing work done for now. [593]
I released the letters into the water, each one a leaf that would finally find its way. [610]
The unsent letters were now sent, not by post, but by the tide and the singing spirits. [627]
I left the labyrinth with the shard in my pocket, its cool weight a reminder that some wounds heal in moonlight. [648]
And the apology, once unspoken, now lived in the song of the mangroves, fierce and tender, forever. [665]
