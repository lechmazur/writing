The fractal weaver woke in the bronze grotto as starlight filtered through the melting snow above. [16]
Each spring, after the first snowmelt, water traced new patterns across the copper-veined walls, echoing her own endless designs. [34]
For seventeen years she had been boundary-lessly trapped—not by stone, but by the recursive spirals of her own tapestries, which folded space into impossible interiors without exits. [62]
Her fingers moved through the air, weaving threads of light and memory that dissolved into smaller versions of themselves, each containing the whole. [83]
Tonight she would finally collect the weights of different burdens, a task that required both precision and surrender. [99]
The kerosene lamp burner rested on a ledge of weathered bronze, its brass wick-holder twisted into a shape that remembered fire. [118]
She had carried it since her arrival, though the fuel had long since evaporated, leaving only the essential geometry of transformation. [136]
In the grotto's shingled hush, silence layered upon silence like slate tiles, each bearing the ghost of a sound that had never been made. [158]
Footsteps from her first day still echoed somewhere beneath the most recent quiet, trapped in the acoustic folds. [174]
The weaver understood that every burden—regret, grief, the weight of a forgotten name—possessed its own specific gravity in the soul. [194]
To measure them, she must calcify each one, transforming ephemeral ache into fossilized record. [206]
This required orienting properly, aligning her inner compass with the absent flame. [216]
She held the lamp burner toward the constellation visible through the grotto's open ceiling, rotating it until the wick-holder's shadow fell across her palm in a perfect spiral. [242]
The first burden was her daughter's voice, lost to time. [250]
She drew it from the air, a filament of sound no wider than a spider's thread, and wound it around the burner's cool brass. [271]
By orienting properly, she aligned the memory with the stars, and the metal began to warm. [285]
Slowly, the voice calcified into a translucent crystal, its weight barely that of a sigh, yet dense with unshed tears. [303]
She placed it in the scale she'd fashioned from bronze shavings and moonlight, marking the measurement in the grotto wall with a needle of starlight. [326]
The second burden was heavier: the weight of her own pride, which had built the walls she now inhabited. [342]
This one she pulled from her chest like a splinter of ice, feeling it take shape between her fingers. [358]
When she wrapped it around the lamp burner, the brass turned cold and heavy, pulling her hands downward. [374]
Orienting properly this time meant turning her back to the stars, facing only the darkness of her own creation. [389]
The pride calcified into a black stone, dense and smooth, its weight equal to seventeen years of solitude. [404]
Each burden she collected added another layer to the shingled hush, until the silence became so thick it was nearly a substance itself. [425]
The fractal patterns on the walls began to shift, responding to the measured weights. [436]
Some spirals tightened, others loosened, as if the grotto itself was recalibrating its trap. [448]
The final burden was the simplest and most terrible: the weight of her own existence, the fact of being unforgiven. [465]
This she could not pull from the air or chest, but had to weave from the threads of all the others combined. [484]
As she worked, the kerosene lamp burner grew hot in her hands, remembering its purpose. [498]
By orienting properly—northstar above, grotto below, past and future held in equal suspension—the weaver completed her collection. [515]
The final calcification happened all at once, every burden crystallizing into a single, perfect sphere that hovered between her palms. [533]
It had no weight at all, or perhaps it was so heavy it had become its own gravity. [548]
In that moment, the boundary-lessly trap revealed its nature: it had never been a prison, but a loom. [563]
The bronze walls were not containment, but the warp and weft of a tapestry that required seventeen years to complete. [579]
The fractal weaver placed the sphere in the lamp burner, where it glowed with a pale, whalebone light. [595]
Starlight and memory merged, and the grotto exhaled a shingled hush that finally, after all this time, became true silence. [613]
She stepped through the wall as though it were woven air, carrying only the lamp burner, its flameless fire lighting her way into the spring night. [635]
