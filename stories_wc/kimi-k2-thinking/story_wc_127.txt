The amber grotto glowed at dusk, honeyed light pooling on stone. [11]
I arrived early, as the transformation completes, to prepare the final dose. [23]
My client, a weary bureaucrat, wanted to feel empathy for his estranged daughter. [36]
He had paid in crisp notes, half truths wrapped in official seals. [48]
I am a counterfeit emotion dealer; my craft lies in synthetic sympathy. [60]
Professionally thorough, I test each blend for nuance, for lingering residue. [71]
Tonight's batch needed a gentle touch, a whisper of compassion without the weight. [84]
I withdrew a fragrance chemist's blotter petal, thin as a moth's wing. [96]
The petal had absorbed a dozen half-truths, each trembling at my fingertips. [108]
When I held it, static electricity prickled my palm, a silent alert. [120]
Sensing through static electricity is my method; the charge reveals emotional potency. [132]
I let the current guide me, adjusting the dosage drop by drop. [144]
The client stepped into the grotto, his silhouette haloed by amber light. [156]
He wore a nervous smile, a mask of half truths he believed. [168]
I gestured to the stone bench, inviting him to sit and receive. [180]
The air thickened with resinous scent, a prelude to synthetic comfort. [191]
I dipped the blotter petal into the vial, watching amber liquid climb. [203]
A spark leapt from the glass to my finger, confirming readiness. [214]
I handed the petal to him, a fragile bridge between his silence and feeling. [228]
He hesitated, then pressed it to his lips, inhaling the engineered warmth. [240]
The transformation began, a subtle tide of borrowed empathy subsuming his apathy. [252]
I observed, professionally detached, yet a faint affection stirred within me. [263]
My work, after all, was to fuse insight with empathy, not merely to sell. [277]
The static charge on my palm had taught me the shape of feeling. [290]
Yet I remained a spectator, a dealer of counterfeit heartbeats. [300]
Minutes passed, measured by the distant drip of water on stone. [311]
His breathing synced with the pulse of the grotto, slow and even. [323]
I noted the softening of his jaw, the wetness at his eyes. [335]
Genuine emotion, even mimicked, could bloom in the amber dark. [345]
But the half truth remained: the feeling would fade by morning. [356]
He would awaken, empty, perhaps blaming himself for the void. [366]
I had warned him, in my professionally thorough way, of this limit. [378]
Still, his need to fuse insight with empathy was stronger than caution. [390]
I watched his shoulders sag, surrendering to the manufactured kindness. [400]
The grotto's amber walls seemed to pulse in time with his heartbeat. [412]
Dusk deepened, shadows stretching like fingers across the stone floor. [422]
I could feel the subtle static of his new emotion, a faint hum. [435]
It was not my own, yet it resonated, a borrowed frequency. [446]
My motivation, always, was to fuse insight with empathy, to learn the shape of hearts. [461]
But I could only watch, a detached artisan, as the transformation completed. [473]
The client lifted his gaze, eyes bright with unfamiliar warmth. [483]
He whispered a thank you, voice cracking, a sound of fragile sincerity. [495]
I nodded, a gesture both warm and distant, affectionate detachment in practice. [507]
He rose, the borrowed empathy steadying his steps toward the exit. [518]
I remained, static electricity still dancing on my skin, a reminder of connection. [531]
In the silence, I reflected on the half truths that fuel my trade. [544]
Each counterfeit feeling was a lesson, a glimpse into a world I cannot inhabit. [558]
I am the dealer, the watcher, the one who subsumes others' voids. [570]
Yet tonight, a faint hum lingered, hinting that perhaps some residue remained. [582]
I touched the blotter petal once more, feeling a whisper of static. [594]
It held no emotion now, only the memory of a borrowed truth. [606]
I placed it back in its leather case, closing the lid gently. [618]
The grotto's amber light began to fade, night claiming the last warmth. [630]
I stood alone, a figure suspended between insight and empathy. [640]
My motivation, though hidden, was to fuse insight with empathy. [650]
Perhaps one day I would find a truth that could be wholly felt. [663]
Until then, I would remain the dealer, the silent observer, the static hum. [676]
I turned toward the exit, leaving the amber grotto to its own quiet. [689]
The night air greeted me, cool against the lingering warmth of borrowed emotion. [702]
I walked through the grove, aware of the half truths trailing behind. [714]
My footsteps were quiet, yet they echoed the rhythm of my own hidden heart. [728]
In the distance, the city lights flickered, a constellation of strangers' stories. [740]
I felt the static of those lives, a faint electric hum. [751]
It was my curse and my compass, guiding me through the counterfeit trade. [764]
I would return tomorrow, to another grotto, another dusk, another half truth. [776]
My purpose: to fuse insight with empathy, one borrowed feeling at a time. [789]
The static electricity within me quieted, settling into a patient wait. [800]
