Elara's fingers traced the singed edges of the burned tarot card as she descended into the catacomb orchard. [18]
The Hierophant's face had melted into a waxen smear, but she could still feel the prophecy trapped beneath the char. [38]
Here, in the half-lit corridors beneath the city, tree roots snaked between bones, inlaying meaning everywhere the living world forgot. [58]
Each gnarled root seemed to whisper of bartered destinies, of souls who had traded futures for forgotten truths. [76]
Elara was a reckless idealist, the kind who believed she could patch holes in the soul with nothing but conviction and borrowed time. [99]
Her sister's death had left a void no prayer could fill, a silence that echoed through her ribs. [117]
The catacombs offered a different currency: memories for miracles, grief for guidance. [129]
She moved through the bone orchard with fiercely gentle steps, careful not to disturb the sleeping dead even as she challenged their keepers. [152]
A root brushed her ankle, and she felt the pulse of something ancient, something that understood sacrifice. [169]
The Keeper emerged from the shadows, his form bent like the trees above, his eyes burnished coins in the dim. [189]
'You bring the card,' he rasped, voice like rustling leaves over stone. [201]
'I bring a question,' Elara answered, holding the burned tarot card between them like a shield. [217]
The Keeper's laugh was dry as bone dust. [225]
'The Hierophant burned for a reason, child. [232]
Some bridges between worlds must be broken.' [239]
Elara's jaw set in dusky resolve, the stubborn light that remained when all other fires had died. [256]
'My sister's destiny was stolen,' she said, fiercely gentle even in accusation. [268]
'I want to barter for it back.' [275]
The Keeper studied her, seeing the hollow places in her soul she tried to hide. [290]
'You would trammel the natural order for one life?' [299]
'I would trammel the gods themselves if it meant patching the hole she left behind.' [314]
He extended a hand, fingers like withered branches. [322]
'Place the card on the root,' he instructed. [330]
Elara knelt, her knees pressing into the packed earth between ribs and femurs. [343]
She laid the burned tarot card upon the thickest root, watching as the wood began to glow. [360]
The Hierophant's image seeped into the bark, inlaying meaning everywhere, the burned edges healing into golden script. [377]
Her sister's name appeared, then vanished, then appeared again—uncertain, flickering. [387]
'The price,' the Keeper said, 'is memory.' [394]
Elara understood: to barter for a destiny, she must surrender her own. [406]
Every moment she had shared with her sister, every laugh, every argument, would become the soil in which this orchard grew. [427]
The reckless idealist in her screamed that this was too much, that some prices couldn't be paid. [444]
But the fiercely gentle sister in her, the one who still heard her sibling's voice in dreams, nodded. [462]
She touched the root, and memories poured out of her like water from a broken dam. [478]
Birthday candles, whispered secrets, the way her sister's hand felt in hers during their mother's funeral. [494]
Each memory inlayed itself into the wood, inlaying meaning everywhere, becoming part of the living catacombs. [510]
The root pulsed, accepting her offering. [516]
The Keeper watched, impassive, as Elara's eyes dulled, as the sharp edges of her grief softened into something else. [535]
Not healed—never healed—but transformed. [539]
A new card materialized from the root, unburned, pristine. [548]
The Hierophant stared back at her, whole and wise. [557]
But when Elara reached for it, her fingers passed through smoke. [568]
'The destiny is restored,' the Keeper said, 'but the vessel is changed.' [580]
Elara's sister would wake tomorrow in a body not her own, with memories not quite right. [596]
The barter was complete, but imperfect, as all such transactions are. [607]
Elara rose, lighter and heavier all at once, her soul patched but threadbare. [620]
She walked back through the half-lit corridors, the roots no longer whispering to her. [634]
The catacomb orchard had taken her memories as payment, inlaying meaning everywhere in its endless, hungry growth. [651]
Above, the city continued, unaware that destinies had been bartered beneath its streets. [664]
Elara climbed the final stairs, clutching the burned tarot card that was now just a dead piece of paper. [683]
But in the dusky resolve of morning, she could almost feel her sister's pulse in her own chest. [701]
The hole remained, but it was a different shape now—one she could learn to live inside. [717]
She had trammelled fate, and fate had trammelled her back, and in the space between, something new had grown. [736]
The catacombs kept their counsel, the roots kept their bones, and Elara kept her dusky resolve, fiercely gentle as dawn broke over a world slightly more whole than before. [765]
