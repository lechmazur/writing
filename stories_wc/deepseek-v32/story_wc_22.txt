<story>The gloom-hill coachman, Arrin, came to the blooming jetty every twilight, after the reef died. [18] His boots, cracked like the parched earth he once drove his carriage over, sank into the soft peat between the luminous evening primroses. [37] The jetty was a finger of stubborn life pointing into the toxic, still sea, a monument of narrow vastness--a tiny, vibrant kingdom against a backdrop of endless, silent ruin. [66] His motivation was simple, a quiet crusade: to let a garden reclaim a battlefield. [81] This spit of land had been the final, furious rampart in the last war, soaked in chemical fire and blood. [101] Now, he sought to bury it under beauty. [109]

From his patched coat, Arrin drew his collection of dried seed pods, each a tiny, rattling husk rescued from the skeletal remains of the reef's coastal forests. [139] They were his only cargo now, his reason for being. [149] He spoke to them sometimes, not in the common tongue, but in the whispering phonemes of languages erased by that same war. [176] Arrin spoke dead languages; it was his peculiar attribute, learned from moldering archives, and now he used them to coax life from the dead. [206] He believed words held shape, and old words might remember older, greener worlds. [223]

His method was precise, born of years of observation. [232] He would fertilize the ground not with common manure, but by understanding bird calls. [250] As the sky purpled, the twilight flocks came to the jetty's blossoms. [263] Arrin would stand, impossibly still, his head tilted, translating their sharp cries and liquid trills. [283] A chattering sequence from a finch might mean the soil here was sour; a warbler's descending note could indicate a pocket of residual salts. [313] The birds, feeding on the blooms, were the garden's physicians, and he their interpreter. [330] He would then take a seed pod, crush it in his palm, and mix its dust with a specific compost, depositing it where the avian intelligence directed. [365]

Tonight, the birds were agitated. [369] Their calls were not about the soil, but about the water. [381] They spoke of a change, a shift in the slow, deathly currents. [395] Arrin followed their guidance to the jetty's very end, where the primroses gave way to slick stone. [417] The water here, usually a stagnant mirror, showed a faint, phosphorescent swirl. [435] Peering down, he saw it--the submerged concord. [444] It was not a document, but a thing: the ancient, coral-formed treaty pillar from the dead reef, somehow carried here by tides and wedged in the jetty's pilings. [481] Its carved runes, visible through the clear, shallow water, glowed with a soft, biotic light. [500] It spoke of an alliance between land and sea, a promise of mutual care forgotten in the fury of war. [525]

This was the key. [528] The concord's presence explained why life clung to this jetty and nowhere else. [545] Its slow, submerged leeching was the true, unseen fertilizer. [557] But it was failing, its light guttering. [565] The birds cried that it needed the memory of growth, the essence of the land it was sworn to protect. [587] Arrin understood. [589] He emptied his entire collection of dried seed pods onto the stones. [603] Using a dead liturgical tongue, he chanted the words of the treaty over them, grinding them into a fine, fragrant powder. [630] He did not cast it on the soil, but offered it to the sea, scattering it over the glowing pillar in a slow, ritual circle. [658]

For a moment, nothing. [662] Then, the glow intensified, a gentle pulse racing through the water and up through the jetty's stone. [685] The blooms around him seemed to brighten, their scent deepening. [698] New shoots, unseen before, pushed through the peat at his feet, not just on the jetty, but beginning a slow march inland, toward the scarred battlefield. [732] The narrow vastness held its breath. [738] The garden was no longer just reclaiming; it was remembering its covenant, and its reclamation would be vast. [760] Arrin, the gloom-hill coachman who now carried no one but the future, sat on the wet stone and listened as the birdsongs turned, for the first time, into hymns. [795]</story>
