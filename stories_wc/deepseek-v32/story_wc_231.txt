<story>At nautical twilight, Arvid stood on the opal dock, its milky, iridescent planks glowing softly in the failing light. [21] The mist, a softly persistent veil, muffled the world beyond the harbor's mouth. [40] He was the lighthouse keeper here, a man considered pleasantly eccentric by the distant village. [62] His isolation was not absolute; it was a witnessed isolation, observed from afar by those who noted his light's regular turn. [90] Tonight, however, his vigil was broken. [96] A body had washed against the dock's barnacled legs just before dusk. [113] A stranger, pale and water-swollen, with a curious ornament pinned to his sodden coat: a dried Edelweiss boutonniere, its delicate white petals felted and gray with age. [158] Arvid felt a compulsion he could not name, a motivation to decode this stranger's final gesture. [180] The flower, a relic of high, dry mountains, was a stark anomaly on this wet, low coast. [204]

He decided to investigate. [207] His method would be by observing gaps, the absences and silences that often spoke louder than facts. [231] He had the body brought to the lighthouse's cool storeroom, its keeper's cottage now a makeshift mortuary. [255] The man carried no identification, his pockets yielding only salt and lint. [273] The official constable from the village would not come until morning, delayed by the fog. [293] This gave Arvid time. [297] He studied the man's hands—calloused, but not a fisherman's; they spoke of different labor. [320] The clothing, though sea-ravaged, was of good, sturdy wool. [336] The gaps were profound: no ship was reported missing, no one was seeking him. [356] He was a void washed into Arvid's solitary domain. [369]

Arvid's eyes kept returning to the Edelweiss. [379] It was a buttonhole flower, meant for celebration or remembrance. [395] To carry it into the sea suggested a profound fidelity. [408] Sitting in his lamplit kitchen, Arvid touched its brittle stem. [422] A sudden, visceral shock, not his own, lanced through him—a borrowed memory of thin, cold air and a woman's laughter echoing off rock. [461] He snatched his hand away, his heart hammering. [471] The impression faded, leaving only the taste of alpine frost. [484] The flower was a vessel, its pressed life holding echoes of another place, another love. [506] He understood then that he could trace the path not by what the man carried, but by what the man *was* carrying inside, impressions left upon this token. [552]

Arvid returned to the opal dock, the mist now a luminous blanket in the dark. [570] He closed his eyes, focusing on the softly persistent lap of water against the glowing planks. [592] He unpinned the boutonniere and held it tightly. [603] This time, the borrowed memories flowed not as a shock, but as a mournful stream. [623] He saw a steep valley, a wooden chalet, a promise made. [638] He felt the wrench of departure, the weight of a decision to seek a new life across the sea, and the vow to return. [670] The Edelweiss was the token of that vow. [681] The final memory was not of mountains, but of a storm-tossed deck, the flower pinned with trembling fingers as green water loomed—a final, loyal gesture to a memory, a private sacrament against oblivion. [733]

At dawn, the constable arrived, expecting simple facts. [744] Arvid met him on the dock. [750] "His name was Emil," Arvid said quietly, the first sun striking the opal to fire. [770] "He was a woodcarver from the Alps, bound for the new country to earn a fortune for his family." [795] He offered no source for his knowledge, only a serene certainty. [811] The constable, looking at the eccentric keeper's calm, knowing face and the silent sea, simply wrote it down. [838] Arvid watched the mist burn away, no longer just a witness to isolation, but a keeper of a story that had, however briefly, bridged the deepest gap of all. [880]</story>
