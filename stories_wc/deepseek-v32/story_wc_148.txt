The son of the boy who cried wolf stood in the lighthouse prison, his inheritance a curse of disbelief. [14]
He had come to this jagged reef to chase hush, the silence that followed false alarms. [30]
His motivation was clear: to thread the labyrinth with his own story, weaving truth from his father's lies. [48]
The prison, a stone spiral rising from sea spray, held him in copperlight repose as dusk filtered through high windows. [68]
Before they find the bodies, he thought, he must understand the impossibilities sustained here. [82]
He remembered the lattice from confessional, a carved wood fragment his father kept as a relic of repentance. [98]
It now rested in his pocket, a tactile guide through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades. [117]
That door, hidden behind a rusted grate, was his method into the prison's heart. [130]
He hovered at the threshold, uncertainty a familiar cloak. [137]
The action felt like hovering between truth and myth, a legacy of cried wolves. [151]
Through the door, he entered a corridor where walls whispered with the salt of years. [165]
The lighthouse beam swept overhead, its light sustaining impossibilities by painting shadows that defied geometry. [180]
Chasing hush meant seeking the quiet beneath the groan of gears and the crash of waves. [196]
He moved softly, his steps echoing the need to thread this labyrinth with a narrative of his own making. [215]
The lattice from confessional seemed to pulse in his pocket, as if remembering secrets absolved. [230]
Before they find the bodies, he repeated, knowing that time was a tide receding. [244]
The narrow door's scuffs told a story of countless passages, each mark a ghost of intent. [260]
He followed them upward, where copperlight repose deepened into amber gloom. [271]
Here, the attribute of the place revealed itself: it sustained impossibilities by holding time in suspension. [288]
Memories hovered in the air, tangible as dust motes in the beam. [299]
His father's voice seemed to echo, warning of wolves that never came. [311]
But here, in this lighthouse prison, the wolves were real, and their howls were the wind through cracks. [330]
To thread the labyrinth, he began to speak his story aloud, a confession to the stones. [347]
"I am the son of lies," he said, "chasing hush after a lifetime of noise." [361]
The lattice from confessional grew warm, as if absorbing his words. [372]
Through the scuffs on the door, he had found a path only the desperate could see. [388]
He climbed higher, the action of hovering giving way to determined ascent. [399]
Before they find the bodies, he must reach the top, where the light sustained the impossible truth. [417]
The copperlight repose now felt like a blanket, comforting yet heavy with expectation. [429]
At the pinnacle, he found a room where the lighthouse keeper should have been. [442]
Instead, there were shadows that moved like bodies, but no corpses yet. [454]
He understood: the bodies were the lies, physical here in this prison of belief. [468]
To thread the labyrinth with his own story, he placed the lattice from confessional on a central table. [486]
It glowed with a soft light, chasing hush into every corner. [497]
The impossibilities sustained here were the stories themselves, given form by faith and fear. [511]
He hovered over the lattice, watching as it mapped the labyrinth on its wooden grid. [527]
Through this method, he saw the way out: not through escape, but through acceptance. [542]
Before they find the bodies, he would tell his tale, weaving it into the very fabric of the place. [561]
The copperlight repose settled into a permanent dusk, and he knew he had threaded the labyrinth. [578]
His story now sustained the impossibilities, a new truth in the lighthouse prison off the jagged reef. [596]
And as silence fell, he finally found the hush he had been chasing. [610]
The end. [612]
