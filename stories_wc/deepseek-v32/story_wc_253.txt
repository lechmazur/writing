In the years after the happiness mandate, silence had become a carefully remade hush. [16] It was not a natural quiet, but one manufactured by the constant, low thrum of the giant wind turbines that overshadowed the old farmhouse. [34] Here, Leo lived, a blank-faced performer whose official smile had been retired along with the state-sanctioned revelry. [52] His motivation was private, stubborn: to cultivate a fragile lightness in the grip of a grief that the mandate had declared illegal. [74] The air was thick with the emotional void he carried, a nullity where joy and sorrow had once battled. [92]

Each morning, Leo performed his rituals without expression. [100] He would stand at the sink, washing a single cup, and announce to the empty room, "Behold, the water cascades like liquid diamonds, cleansing the porcelain altar of morning's first sacrament." [134] This method, dramatically narrating every mundane task, was his remaining art, a way to impose narrative order on a life stripped of feeling. [158] After the theatrical cleaning, he would take his seat by the window, the turbines' sweeping shadows passing over him like silent clock hands. [184]

On the rough oak table lay the object that anchored his days: a dried flower bouquet, its colors faded to dust and memory. [208] It had been her bouquet, from before the mandate, when happiness was not a duty but a chance occurrence. [230] Now, he sought not to mourn her, but to find a slender peace in her absence, a task morally ambiguous in a world that demanded either perfect joy or nothing at all. [262] His tools were simple: a small knife and a block of pale pine. [276]

He began to whittle, the sharp blade peeling away long, curling strips of wood. [290] His voice, flat and steady, narrated the action. [298] "The sculptor confronts the formless flesh of the tree," he intoned, "liberating the shape that dreams within." [318] The shavings collected like pale petals around the dried flowers. [330] He was carving a small bird, its wings perpetually unfurled. [342] This whittling was his meditation, his fingers remembering a craft that required no smiling. [360]

Outside, the turbines generated their clean, mandated power, contributing to the societal happiness grid while casting the farmhouse in a perpetual, rotating shade. [386] Their presence had remade the landscape's sound, replacing the rustle of crops with that engineered hush, a sound like suppressed thoughts. [410] Leo's own silence was a mirror to it, a personal void where his performances now unfolded for no audience. [430] He sometimes wondered if his refusal to feel joy was a sin, or if his cultivation of a gentle grief was a deeper kindness. [456] This moral ambiguity was his only companion. [466]

One afternoon, as a turbine shadow swept through the room, he set down the nearly finished bird and lifted the dried bouquet. [488] "Consider the preserved blooms," he dramatized, his face a placid mask. [502] "Their vitality is archived, a testament to seasons that obeyed no decree." [518] He placed the wooden bird among the brittle stems, a futile attempt to marry memory with creation. [538] The act felt both sacred and selfish, a theft of energy from the happy world beyond his windows. [558]

The remade hush of the farmhouse was complete, a capsule of resisted time. [574] Here, Leo could exist in the aftermath, tending his grief like a secret garden. [590] His performances at the sink, at the table, were bulwarks against the overwhelming pressure to be well. [610] The whittling produced tangible, silent things from formless wood, just as his narration carved meaning from empty hours. [632]

He finished the bird, smoothing its wings with his thumb. [642] Holding it beside the dried flowers, he felt nothing, and in that emotional void, he found a strange, light equilibrium. [664] It was not happiness, but it was not the crushing weight he was supposed to avoid. [682] It was simply a breath held, a space kept open in a world that demanded closure. [702] The turbines turned, the shadows passed, and the blank-faced performer prepared to narrate the brewing of his evening tea, another mundane epic in his private, morally ambiguous sanctuary. [738] The bouquet would remain on the table, a relic in the quiet he had remade, where lightness meant the absence of all heavy demands. [762] He picked up his knife again, selecting a new block of wood, ready to whittle another piece of the silence away. [786]</story>
