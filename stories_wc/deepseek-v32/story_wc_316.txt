The dojo floated on a rock island, adrift in a sky where the clouds sometimes showed legion banners or extinct spacecraft. [23] Kael stood at its stone rail, watching history rewrite itself in the shimmering air below. [41] He was an ego death survivor, which meant he remembered the shattering of his 'self' but none of the emotions that had once filled it. [69] His motivation was simple and immense: to defeat the emotional numbness that was his constant state. [88] Inside the dojo's central hall, Master Liren awaited him. [100] "You have learned all our physical forms," Liren said, his voice like grinding stone. [115] "But your blade has no edge, because you feel nothing." [126] He gestured to a pedestal, where a glass jar pulsed with soft, amber light. [141] Inside, a brain floated, connected by fine filaments to the pedestal base. [155] A small, clear label read: DUPLICATE. [162]

"This is your path," Liren said. [168] "And your opponent." [172] He explained that years ago, during Kael's ego death treatment, a clone had been grown from his genetic material, a desperate attempt to anchor his dissolving psyche. [207] The procedure failed, leaving the clone's mind stillborn, preserved here. [221] Now, the clone's corporate creators and the dojo's spiritual order were locked in a bitter clone custody battle. [241] The corporation saw property; the dojo saw a soul in potential. [253] "The court of shifting eras will decide its fate tomorrow," Liren said, "while history rewrites itself outside these walls." [276] "What has this to do with me?" Kael asked, his voice flat. [287] "You are the original template," Liren replied. [295] "Only you can vivify that which is dormant. [304] To do so, you must face it, and in doing so, face everything you have lost." [323]

The method, Liren taught, was through complementary opposites. [333] Not by forcing feeling, but by finding its missing counterpart. [345] Rage was countered by stillness, grief by a vast, accepting silence. [358] Kael spent hours before the jar, the duplicate brain flickering with his own neural patterns. [376] He felt nothing, but the brain would sometimes glow brighter, as if reacting to a ghost of sensation. [397] The corporate lawyers arrived at dawn, their suits sharp against the dojo's worn rock. [414] They spoke of investment and intellectual property, arguments that sliced through the dojo's spiritual pretense with cold legality. [438] Kael watched, detached, until the lead lawyer pointed at him. [449] "That man is no more the owner than we are; his identity was erased. [464] The clone is ours." [469]

Something tightened in Kael's chest, a phantom sensation. [479] He looked from the lawyer's scornful face to the brain in the jar, a copy of what he once was, and felt a new, clean blade of clarity form within. [510] It sliced through his own pretense of complete numbness. [520] There was a spark there, not feeling, but its opposite: a will to protect. [536] The custody hearing commenced in the dojo's hall, the very air trembling as empires rose and fell in the vistas below. [560] The lawyers presented their claim. [566] Master Liren presented his, speaking of latent humanity. [577] The judge, a figure whose form seemed to shift with the historical tides, turned to Kael. [594] "And you, original template? What is your claim?" [605]

Kael walked to the pedestal and placed a hand on the cool glass. [617] He did not try to summon love or sorrow, which were echoes to him. [631] Instead, he focused on their complementary opposites: the profound emptiness after loss, the calm that follows terror. [651] He channeled the void of his ego death, not as a lack, but as a vessel. [666] He sought to vivify not by injecting emotion, but by offering the quiet space where emotion could finally live. [688] The brain in the jar began to pulse, not with borrowed light, but with a deep, internal rhythm. [707] The filaments glowed gold. [712] A single, clear thought, not his own, yet intimately familiar, echoed in Kael's mind: *Brother.* [730]

The judge observed, and the rewriting history outside seemed to pause. [742] "Custody," the judge pronounced, "is granted to the whole, not the part." [756] The lawyers vanished in a huff of temporal static. [765] Kael looked at the brain, now softly shining, and then at Master Liren. [778] For the first time since his shattering, he felt the faintest warmth, the complementary opposite of the cold that had long imprisoned him. [800]</story>
