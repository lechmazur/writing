<story>Silas was a labyrinth maintenance worker, a humble title for a humbling job. [13] His duty was to walk the ancient, overgrown hedge corridors, trimming wayward branches and clearing the moss-clogged drains. [30] Tonight, he was not in the labyrinth proper, but in the stormlit tower that presided over its heart. [50] A crack of thunder split the sky, and for a moment, the stone chamber was bathed in a silver flash. [70] Then the clouds parted, and true, steady moonlight poured through the tall, broken windows. [85] Silas felt the familiar, cool tingle on his skin; his old pruning scar, which always ached by day, began to soften and fade, for he healed in moonlight. [115] It was a private, mundane miracle. [121]

He had come here seeking a tool, something to help with his deeper, unofficial work. [137] His true motivation, a quiet obsession that had grown over years of listening to the rustling hedges, was to discover what trees witness. [163] They had seen centuries pass, rooted in one place, observing everything. [177] On his workbench, next to shears and a whetstone, lay the astronomer's broken sextant. [195] He had found it years ago in a bramble-choked alcove, its brass tarnished, its index mirror shattered. [216] It was useless for navigating by stars, but he had found another use for it. [233]

Silas picked up the sextant, its weight familiar in his hands. [245] He did not look through it at the sky, but pointed it down, through the tower window, at the labyrinth below. [267] In the moon's glow, the instrument did not measure angles, but something else. [284] A faint, sorrowful light, like mist, seeped from the labyrinth's paths, and the sextant's broken gears clicked softly, giving it a number. [314] This was his method for a strange task: by mapping scattered dreams. [330] The labyrinth, he had learned, did not just trap physical bodies; it absorbed the lost hopes and regrets of those who wandered it. [358] These emotional echoes lingered like fog, and the broken sextant could quantify them. [377] It measured a core concept he had come to know intimately: quantified sorrow. [394]

His goal tonight was to deconstruct the labyrinth's hold on these old feelings. [409] To do that, he needed to chart the dream-mist, to follow its trails to their source and release them. [433] He took a reading: 7.3 units of sorrow from the western spiral, 2.1 from the north gate. [455] He noted them on his wax tablet, his movements practiced and routine. [470] As he worked, the storm grumbled on the horizon, but the tower was bathed in silent, pearlescent light. [492]

Then, it happened: at the moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor. [507] A tiny, metallic *ping* echoed up the tower's stairwell, sharp and undeniable. [524] It was the sound of a single, long-rusted iron pin falling from some decaying mechanism far below. [547] In the absolute quiet that followed, Silas felt a shift. [559] The quantified sorrow on his sextant's dial suddenly spiked, then swirled, forming a new pattern. [580] The scattered dreams were aligning, drawn to the sound of that tiny, final release. [599]

He understood. [601] The sound was a key. [605] Mapping the dreams was not enough; he had to listen for the moments of letting go. [625] Silas rushed down the winding stairs, through a silent corridor littered with fallen leaves, and into the open heart of the labyrinth. [651] There stood the oldest yew tree, gnarled and vast. [662] In the moonlight, he saw the dream-mist flowing into its roots. [678] He placed his hand on the rough bark, and a vision unfolded, not in images, but in knowing. [701] He saw a young astronomer, centuries past, weeping against this tree, having failed to chart a course to his love. [727] He saw a guard, centuries later, dropping a pin from his cloak clasp as he accepted a fate he could not change. [757] The tree had witnessed it all, holding these silent stories without judgment. [775]

Silas simply stood, sharing the witness, and the quantified sorrow on the sextant dial gently faded to zero. [797] It was another mundane miracle, complete. [805]</story>
