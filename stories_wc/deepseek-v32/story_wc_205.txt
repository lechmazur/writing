The asteroid Valse was a baroque masterpiece, its caverns and spires carved with intricate filigree that gleamed under the distant sun. [17] After the Great Rend, time had become visible, a shimmering haze that clung to objects and people, revealing their age and decay like a perpetual sunset. [41] Here, Elara, once a fiery revolutionary, now moved through the ruins as a defunct icon, her dreams of upheaval dust in the stagnant air. [66] She was poetically inclined, seeing metaphors in the drifting dust and allegories in the cracked arches. [85] Her current occupation was an archaeological dispute, a bitter scholarly war over the true nature of Valse's original inhabitants. [107] The central artifact was a single crystal vase shard, unearthed from the deepest catacomb, its edges sharp and its surface etched with faint, unreadable script. [135] Elara believed it held the key to reimagine an entire civilization, not as the brutal theocracy the dominant theory claimed, but as a society of profound aesthetic sensitivity. [164] To prove this, she needed to devise a new interpretation of the fragment, one that wove together all the scattered clues. [186] Her research had led her to a peculiar practice: covering mirrors during storms, a ritual noted in fragmentary logs found in a subsidiary dig. [212] She pondered this as she sat in her study, the visible time swirling around her like golden mist, accentuating every line on her hands. [238] The storms on Valse were not of wind and rain, but of temporal feedback, where the visible time would churn and lash, causing disorientation and fear. [265] Covering mirrors, she hypothesized, was a way to avoid seeing one's own time-ravaged reflection during such episodes, a practice born of a culture that revered beauty but acknowledged decay. [297] This insight fueled her motive, a burnished sorrow that polished her grief for the lost civilization into a determined, graceful purpose. [321] She would use the vase shard and the mirror ritual to paint a portrait of a people who cherished transient beauty, a civilization that danced with time rather than fought it. [350] The opposing faction, led by the pragmatic Dr. Kellor, saw the shard as mere debris from a utilitarian storage vessel and the mirror practice as primitive superstition. [379] Elara's poetic nature rebelled against this sterile view; she felt the sorrow of the past like a physical weight, burnished smooth by years of reflection. [405] One evening, as a temporal storm brewed on the horizon, she took the crystal vase shard in her hand, its cold surface biting into her palm. [431] She walked to the arched window where a tall mirror stood, its frame ornate with silver vines. [450] Following the ancient method, she draped a black velvet cloth over the glass, her movements ritualistic and slow. [471] In the sudden absence of her reflection, with only the shard gleaming in the low light, she felt a connection. [492] She devised her argument: the vase was not for storage, but for display, holding a single, perfect flower whose short life was a celebration of the moment. [521] The script on the shard, she now saw, could be a poetic fragment about light and shadow, a clue to the mirror ritual's deeper meaning. [546] The storm arrived, filling the room with visible time in rushing, amber waves. [564] Without the mirror to show her own aging face, Elara focused on the shard, imagining the hands that had made it. [586] They were hands that covered mirrors to protect the heart from the harsh truth of passing seconds, yet still crafted vases to cradle fleeting beauty. [615] This civilization, she reimagined, was not afraid of time but intimate with it, their sorrow burnished into art. [637] The dispute would rage on, but Elara had found her truth. [653] She would publish her treatise, a elegy woven with archaeological evidence and poetic speculation. [674] As the storm subsided, she removed the cloth from the mirror. [689] Her reflection stared back, aged by the storm's passage, but her eyes held a new clarity. [709] The crystal vase shard on the table caught the returning light, its fracture lines glowing like veins of gold. [731] In that fragment, she saw not a broken thing, but a map of a world that had loved deeply and lost gracefully, a civilization she had reimagined from silence into song. [763] The burnished sorrow of it all was a comfort now, a polished shield against the relentless visibility of time. [785] She smiled, a small, sad curve of lips, and began to write. [798]
