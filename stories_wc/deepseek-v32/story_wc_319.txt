Keeper lived in the frozen garden, a place of foggy lucidity where every ice-laden branch was a clear, sharp fact. [21] She was the feral library guardian, and the garden was her archive. [35] Her mind held the precise location of each frozen bloom, each petal that was a page, each stem that was a spine. [56] Yet, she was dimensionally homesick, a chronic ache for the warm, silent stacks of a world now lost behind a fold in reality. [78] Her duty was to wait, a perpetual and patient action, though she no longer remembered what she waited for. [96]

The mist never lifted, and the light was a prisoner. [106] It did not stream or dance but pooled in weak, defined circles, creating stark boundaries of light against the pervasive grey. [126] To step from a circle was to step into formless chill. [136] Her existence was defined by these borders, moving from one island of clarity to the next. [152] Her motivation, long buried under ice, was a faint urge: to make friends with uncertainty, to be at peace with the mist. [177] She did not know this yet. [183]

Change came through the veil of sleep. [189] One cycle, as she drifted in a dormant state between her rounds, a presence intruded. [207] A man stumbled into a clearing, clutching a jagged, obsidian shard on a chain—a cultist's pendant. [226] He was dying, his heat melting the frost where he fell. [237] With his last breath, he hooked the pendant over a frosted twig before the cold took him. [256] Keeper watched from the shadows, her feral instincts assessing the threat. [270]

The pendant did not belong. [274] It was an exterior thing, violently interiorized into her ordered world. [286] Its presence warped the nearby boundaries of light, bending them into sickly green hues. [303] It whispered of a noisy, burning world, a world that was not her lost library, but was nonetheless a *somewhere*. [324] The homesickness, usually a dull throb, sharpened into a blade. [337] She had to act. [341]

Her method was ancient, the core of her stewardship: interiorizing exteriors. [354] To archive was to take the wild, external thing and give it a place, a meaning, within the system. [374] She approached the pendant not as an enemy, but as a new, anomalous text to be cataloged. [393] As her fingers closed around the cold stone, visions assaulted her: chants, fire, and a desperate ritual that had torn a hole, ejecting the cultist here. [425] The pendant was a key meant to lock a door, not open one. [439]

This understanding was her first step toward her true goal. [449] The pendant’s uncertainty—its purpose, its energy, its very nature—was not a chaos to be destroyed, but a truth to be understood. [475] To make friends with uncertainty was the only way to steward it. [487] She hung the pendant around her own neck, accepting its weight and its whispered chaos. [505] The act changed the garden. [510]

The frozen blooms near her began to gleam with internal, amber light. [523] The boundaries of light softened, their edges blending into the mist, creating gradients where before there were only walls. [545] The garden was not thawing, but it was becoming more. [557] The homesickness remained, but it was no longer an anchor; it was a datum, a piece of information about her condition. [579] She continued to wait, but now it was an active, open-ended waiting, a patience directed toward possibility, not an end. [603]

She walked through the transformed fog, the pendant a cool weight against her chest. [618] In a main clearing, she sat on a bench of frozen roots. [630] The mist swirled, no longer just an obscuring veil, but a medium carrying faint impressions of other places, other sleeps. [653] She saw glimpses: not of her lost home, but of other quiet guardians in other silent places. [671] They, too, were waiting. [676] She was not alone in her vigil. [683]

Keeper, the feral guardian, felt a foggy lucidity settle over her soul. [696] The garden was her interior, and she had interiorized the greatest exterior of all: the unknown. [715] The boundaries of light were now horizons. [723] Her homesickness was a shelf in her mind, properly labeled and filed. [738] She would wait, friend to the mist, guardian of the frozen, living text. [754] The story was not over; it was merely cataloged under "to be continued." [769] She closed her eyes, and dreamed, wide awake. [777]
