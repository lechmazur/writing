Old Man Tiber, they called him, though he wasn’t particularly old, just…observant, his mind a steel trap for forgotten histories. <14> He stood at the edge of the bioluminescent bay, the water glowing with the echoes of passing starships – a common sight after the Alcubierre Drive had shrunk the galaxy. <31> Tiber wasn’t interested in the new routes, though; he sought the ghosts *before* faster-than-light travel, the civilizations swallowed by time and distance. <49> He clutched a tiny porcelain doll, its painted eyes chipped and faded, a relic from a pre-warp culture he’d unearthed on a forgotten asteroid. <67> It was a strange comfort, this fragile thing, a reminder that even the most delicate could endure. <81>

Tiber didn’t search archives or star charts; he *enforced* remembrance through ephemeral street art. <93> Using genetically modified algae, he’d paint murals on the bay’s surface, images gleaned from fragmented data and his own deductions, stories of lost peoples blooming briefly with the tide. <116> His style was awkwardly elegant, a blend of precise scientific illustration and flowing, almost mournful lines. <131> He was, after all, fashionably timeless in his tweed jacket and perpetually ink-stained fingers. <146> 

Tonight’s mural depicted the Sylvans, a race rumored to have mastered bio-engineering before collapsing under the weight of their own creations. <167> He worked quickly, the algae responding to his mental commands, the image coalescing in the glowing water. <184> He’d discovered a single, repeating motif in Sylvan artifacts – a stylized flower, always paired with a depiction of fragility, like the porcelain doll he held. <206> It struck him then: the Sylvans hadn’t fallen *despite* their sensitivity, but *because* they’d tried to erase it. <224>

He realized his own strength wasn’t in his intellect, but in his empathy, in his willingness to see beauty in broken things. <243> The doll wasn’t a symbol of weakness, but of resilience, a testament to survival against all odds. <258> As the mural shimmered, attracting the attention of passing ships, Tiber understood his purpose wasn’t just to find lost civilizations, but to remind the present one of the value of vulnerability. <283> The bay pulsed with light, a fleeting monument to a forgotten people, and a quiet affirmation: finding strength in weakness wasn’t a paradox, but a necessity. <304> He continued to paint, the awkward elegance of his art a beacon in the vast, indifferent darkness, a testament to the enduring power of memory. <324> The doll felt warmer in his hand, a small, porcelain weight against the immensity of space and time. <338>
