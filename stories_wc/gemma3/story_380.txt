Old Man Tiber, a convicted dream thief, traced the chipped wood of the forgotten library built inside the colossal treehouse, the last structure standing after the last human was born. <16> He hadn’t stolen a dream in decades, not since the quiet descended, but the habit of reaching for the intangible lingered, a phantom itch behind his eyes. <33> He clutched a flimsy photo album, its pages brittle and filled with images of a game long past – sky-ball, a sport involving leaps and catches amongst the clouds, a shared love he’d once had with… someone. <56> The faces were blurred, fragmented, mirroring the state of his own self, shattered by years of pilfered memories and a mind mathematically challenged, unable to reconcile the pieces. <78> 

He was here, in this arboreal sanctuary, to coax thunder from empty skies, a foolish ambition born of quiet mania. <93> The old texts spoke of a resonance, a way to awaken the dormant energies of the world through focused recollection, but Tiber’s recollections were… borrowed. <113> He flipped through the album, pausing at a faded image of a soaring figure, a sky-ball clutched tight. <128> Was that him? Was that *her*? He couldn’t be sure; the stolen dreams had overwritten his own, leaving only echoes and impressions. <147>

He needed a focal point, a strong enough memory to act as a conduit. <157> Sky-ball. The feeling of weightlessness, the roar of the crowd (a phantom sound now), the shared exhilaration. <175> He began to meticulously arrange the photos, attempting to reconstruct a specific game, a specific moment, but his numerical disorientation made even sequencing the images a torment. <198> He tried to remember the score, the opposing team, anything concrete, but it slipped through his grasp like sand. <215> 

Frustration mounting, a desperate energy building within him, Tiber decided on a plunge. <224> Not a physical one, but a mental one, a complete surrender to the fragmented memories, a dive into the swirling chaos of stolen dreams. <244> He closed his eyes, the album pressed against his chest, and focused on the feeling of the sky-ball, the wind rushing past his face, the impossible joy. <267> A low rumble echoed through the treehouse, a tremor in the wood. <276> Then, a flicker of grey in the perpetually overcast sky, a promise of something more than silence. <294> It wasn’t thunder, not yet, but it was a start, a fragile echo of a world remembered, or perhaps, imagined. <313> The album slipped from his grasp, its pages fluttering open to reveal only blank spaces. <328> He smiled, a quiet, manic smile, and reached for another dream. <339> The resonance was growing. <344> He felt… almost whole. <349> Almost. <352> The sky darkened. <356> A single drop of rain fell. <360> And then another. <364> The world was listening. <368>
