<story>
Old Man Tiber, a time refugee from the Sunstone Empire, polished the lens of the atom-powered lighthouse, his movements slow and deliberate. <words>17</words>
He hadn’t spoken a full sentence in decades, not since the fracturing, preferring the company of the rhythmic pulse of energy and the endless, grey sea. <words>31</words>
His trustworthiness was strange, a quiet certainty that settled over anyone who lingered near the lighthouse, despite his obvious otherness. <words>47</words>
He’d arrived in the hush of a line that never moves, a temporal eddy depositing him and a single, heavy trunk onto the rocky shore. <words>64</words>
Inside that trunk was little more than dust and an exquisitely embroidered tablecloth, depicting the fall of his city in shimmering, silver thread. <words>83</words>
The tablecloth wasn’t a memento of loss, but a map, a key to a method – a way to briefly, powerfully, alter the past. <words>101</words>
Tiber’s motivation wasn’t to *change* the past, but to bind old wounds with unstoppable will, to offer a single, silent act of defiance. <words>119</words>
For years, he’d studied the celestial mechanics, waiting for the precise alignment of the stars, a configuration that occurred only once every seventy years. <words>138</words>
Tonight was that night. <words>141</words>
He’d repurposed the lighthouse’s energy focusing array, not to signal ships, but to power a makeshift catapult, constructed from salvaged metal and reinforced with woven sea kelp. <words>163</words>
The tablecloth, spread taut across the catapult’s arm, wasn’t meant to launch a projectile, but to *send* a focused wave of temporal energy. <words>183</words>
It wasn’t about grand gestures; it was quietly defiant, a single thread pulled from the tapestry of time. <words>197</words>
He wasn’t aiming for a king to fall or a war to cease, but for a single, overlooked moment – a shared laugh between his sister and his brother, moments before the fracturing. <words>218</words>
He wanted to reinforce that joy, to make it immutable, a tiny beacon against the encroaching darkness. <words>234</words>
The stars aligned, bathing the lighthouse in an ethereal glow, a borrowed dawn. <words>247</words>
Tiber, with a final, almost imperceptible nod, released the mechanism. <words>256</words>
The tablecloth blurred, then vanished in a silent ripple of energy, aimed not at altering history, but at strengthening a memory. <words>276</words>
He didn’t expect a changed world, only a subtle shift within himself, a lessening of the ache. <words>290</words>
The lighthouse beam continued its steady rotation, a silent guardian against the grey, and Tiber resumed polishing the lens, his strange trustworthiness radiating outwards. <words>308</words>
He knew the empire was gone, but a single, joyful moment, fiercely protected, could be a universe unto itself. <words>326</words>
The line still didn’t move, but for the first time in decades, Tiber felt a flicker of something akin to peace. <words>343</words>
He had offered his defiance, not with a shout, but with a whisper across time, woven into the fabric of a forgotten empire. <words>363</words>
