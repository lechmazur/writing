Old Man Tiber, a conscientious objector from a war no one remembered, spent his autumns valiantly bored amongst the gnarled apple trees of the hanging orchard. <31> The orchard, a bruised purple and gold in the ravine battered by storms, wasn’t his by right, but no one challenged his claim. <49> He’d inherited the duty – and the orchard – through a family tradition tied to Samhain, a yearly mapping of…well, not ghosts, but movements. <71> Tiber wasn’t interested in spirits; he was interested in migration routes, specifically those of the “Newcomers,” as the locals coyly called them. <93> 

He’d started his work decades ago, initially charting bird patterns, then deer, then something…else. <108> The local neighborhood watch, a group he subtly influenced, provided the initial data, reporting unusual sightings. <127> Tiber, however, didn’t rely on their panicked whispers; he preferred direct observation, aided by a network of meticulously placed, almost invisible, tripwires. <151> He’d find evidence snagged on them – a feather, a scrap of cloth, once, a small, intricately carved bone. <168> 

This year, at every craft fair within a fifty-mile radius, Tiber was xenial, politely questioning vendors about where they sourced their materials. <189> He wasn’t looking for the materials themselves, but the stories behind them, the origins, the paths they’d traveled. <208> He’d learned to read the subtle tells – a hesitation, a too-smooth explanation, a flicker of something unplaceable in their eyes. <228> 

One afternoon, examining a piece of driftwood jewelry, he found it: a tiny, almost imperceptible scratch on the wood, made by a rusty nail. <249> It wasn’t the nail itself that mattered, but the specific alloy, traceable to a region far beyond any known trade route. <269> He traced the nail’s origin to a pattern emerging from the craft fair data, a convergence point near the old Blackwood farm. <289> The neighborhood watch had reported strange lights there, dismissed as teenagers. <305> Tiber smiled, a slow, unsettling curve of his lips. <312> The Newcomers were changing their routes, and he, the valiantly bored orchard keeper, was ready to chart their new course. <333> He adjusted a tripwire, the rusty nail a silent promise of further revelations. <344> The orchard held its breath, waiting with him. <351> Another craft fair beckoned, another opportunity to listen, to observe, to map the unseen currents flowing through the land. <372> The tradition continued, steeped in coy malevolence and the quiet power of observation. <382>
