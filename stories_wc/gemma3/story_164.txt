Old Man Tiber, a wistful blacksmith more accustomed to shaping steel than dreams, sat between acts of the neon-drenched arcade, the rhythmic blips and crashes a dull counterpoint to his quiet purpose. <18> He wasn’t here for the games, though the flashing lights reflected in the lenses of his augmented eye; he was here for the dust. <31> Tiber collected botanical drawings, not of flowers grown in soil, but of the phantom flora he envisioned reclaiming the wild spaces choked by Neo-Kyoto’s chrome and concrete. <51> His workshop, a cramped space above a noodle bar, overflowed with sketches of luminous mosses clinging to skyscrapers and bioluminescent vines strangling security drones. <72> 

He’d found the arcade’s single skylight ideal for his method: by mapping the swirl of dust motes under its beam, he discerned patterns, echoes of natural growth fighting to emerge even in this artificial environment. <96> It was an obviously subtle art, one he’d perfected over decades, a way to translate the unseen into something tangible. <113> Tiber believed reality was merely a poorly maintained illusion, and he intended to weave fantasy into its cracks. <132> 

Today’s sketch depicted a ‘sky-bloom’, a colossal flower he imagined erupting from the arcade’s roof, its petals filtering the polluted air. <152> He carefully traced the dust-patterns with a stylus on his datapad, a drifting arrogance coloring his movements. <168> He wasn’t creating art, he insisted to anyone who dared ask; he was *remembering* what had been lost. <187> A young woman, a data-runner with vibrant pink hair, paused beside him, glancing at the screen. <205> “Pretty,” she offered, her voice barely audible above the arcade’s din. <213>

Tiber barely acknowledged her, continuing to refine the bloom’s delicate structure. <228> He needed to kindle a belief in this lost world, to show others what *could* be. <243> He wasn’t building weapons or defenses; he was cultivating hope, one dust-mote map at a time. <261> The woman lingered, then quietly slipped a small, metallic seed pod into his hand. <276> “Found it in the undercity,” she murmured. “Thought you might… appreciate it.” <291> Tiber’s augmented eye flickered, a ghost of a smile touching his lips. <303> Perhaps, he thought, reality wasn’t so resistant to change after all. <316> The arcade’s lights seemed a little less harsh, the air a little less stale. <331> He continued to sketch, the sky-bloom taking shape, a promise of green in a world of grey. <348> The seed pod felt warm in his palm, a tiny spark of the wild. <363> He had work to do. <368>
