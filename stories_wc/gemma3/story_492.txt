Old Man Tiber, normally weird even for Neo-Kyoto, hadn’t intended to be a hero, but fractured illusions were a terrible waste. <words>17</words>
He was a distracted inventor, more comfortable coaxing light from static than dealing with people, yet the city’s despair clung to him like smog. <words>31</words>
His motivation wasn’t glory, but a desperate need to gather those broken pieces of hope and forge them into something bright, something real. <words>48</words>
The mission – infiltrate the Crimson Hand’s data haven – felt absurd, especially considering his skillset leaned towards whimsical automatons, not espionage. <words>65</words>
But the Hand was stealing memories, twisting joy into fuel for their control network, and Tiber possessed the only countermeasure: a resonance amplifier. <words>83</words>
He’d need tools, specifically a blacksmith’s tools, to modify the amplifier’s casing for optimal signal penetration. <words>97</words>
The back alley reeked of synth-ramen and regret, a typical scene in Neo-Kyoto, and the perfect cover for his unconventional approach. <words>113</words>
He navigated via interconnected trails – maintenance tunnels, forgotten service routes, the city’s circulatory system ignored by most. <words>129</words>
He found himself in the standstill of a broken escalator, its metal teeth frozen mid-chew, a fitting metaphor for the city’s stagnation. <words>147</words>
The Hand’s workshop was above, guarded by drones and apathy. <words>155</words>
Tiber wasn’t built for direct confrontation; he was a reluctant catalyst, nudging events rather than forcing them. <words>169</words>
He used a sonic emitter, disguised as a bird call, to disrupt the drone’s sensors, creating a momentary blind spot. <words>186</words>
Inside, the blacksmith’s tools lay scattered amongst data cables and weapon schematics, surprisingly unguarded. <words>201</words>
He worked quickly, his hands surprisingly steady despite his usual clumsiness, reinforcing the amplifier with hardened steel and focusing lenses. <words>218</words>
It wasn’t about destruction, but redirection; the amplifier wouldn’t break the Hand’s network, it would flood it with recovered memories, overwhelming their control. <words>238</words>
He activated the device, a pulse of light rippling outwards, and felt a strange sense of peace. <words>251</words>
The Hand’s systems sputtered, then began displaying fragmented images: a child’s laughter, a lover’s embrace, a sunset over a forgotten ocean. <words>271</words>
It was ruthless kindness, a gentle dismantling of their power through the sheer weight of forgotten joy. <words>285</words>
Tiber slipped back into the trails, leaving the chaos to unfold, already thinking about his next project – a machine to bottle the scent of rain. <words>303</words>
He wasn’t a hero, just a weird old man trying to make the world a little less broken, one fractured illusion at a time. <words>321</words>
The city, for a moment, felt a little brighter, a subtle shift in the neon glow, a flicker of hope in the digital darkness. <words>338</words>
He continued on, disappearing into the labyrinthine underbelly of Neo-Kyoto, a ghost in the machine, a catalyst unseen. <words>356</words>
His work was never truly done, but tonight, he’d made a difference, and that was enough. <words>369</words>
