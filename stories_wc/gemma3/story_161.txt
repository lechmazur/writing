Old Man Tiber, a vigilant orchardist even amongst the sterile steel of the paper airplane test facility, was, predictably, never tardy. <words>17</words>
He’d volunteered here for five years, ostensibly to “assess aerodynamic drag on fruit-shaped designs,” but really to escape the ghost of his wife, lost to a suspiciously swift illness. <words>32</words>
His sardonic glee at the engineers’ failures was legendary; he’d offer critiques with a twinkle, always arriving precisely when the next test flight was scheduled. <words>49</words>
Today, however, his attention wasn’t on lift or stall speed, but on Dr. Aris Thorne, the facility’s lead, who seemed… distracted. <words>65</words>
Tiber had discovered an antique letter seal tucked into a discarded project report – a griffin clutching a key – and it felt unsettlingly familiar. <words>81</words>
He’d recognized the crest from a faded photograph of his wife’s estranged family, a lineage rumored to be involved in shadowy dealings. <words>97</words>
He intended to demonstrate, via the patterns in a peacock’s tail – a bizarre hobby he’d picked up after her death, finding order in chaos – that Thorne’s recent “innovations” weren’t innovations at all. <words>118</words>
The peacock’s feather patterns, he believed, mirrored encrypted data streams, and Thorne’s designs echoed specific sequences. <words>134</words>
“Remarkable how consistently your ‘optimized’ wings fail to achieve stable flight, Doctor,” Tiber drawled, watching another plane nose-dive. <words>151</words>
“Just… recalibrating, Tiber,” Thorne mumbled, avoiding eye contact. <words>158</words>
Tiber subtly held up a sketch of a peacock’s tail, overlaid with a diagram of Thorne’s latest wing design; the correlation was undeniable. <words>176</words>
He’d begun unraveling a conspiracy, a network of influence stretching from this unassuming facility to… well, he wasn’t sure yet, but the griffin seal was a starting point. <words>194</words>
His wife’s illness, he now suspected, wasn’t natural; it was a silencing. <words>204</words>
He continued volunteering, meticulously documenting Thorne’s failures, each crash a piece of evidence, each observation a step closer to the truth. <words>223</words>
He’d use the patterns, the seal, and his unwavering punctuality to expose them all. <words>234</words>
The engineers saw a quirky old man obsessed with fruit and birds; Tiber saw a chessboard, and he was finally making his move. <words>251</words>
He wasn’t seeking justice, not exactly; he wanted understanding, a reason for the senseless loss, and a chance to finally lay his wife’s ghost to rest. <words>271</words>
He’d found a purpose in the sterile environment, a way to channel his grief into something sharp and focused. <words>286</words>
Thorne, increasingly flustered by Tiber’s pointed observations, began making mistakes, revealing inconsistencies in his data. <words>303</words>
The peacock’s tail, a symbol of beauty and hidden eyes, was guiding him through the labyrinth of deceit. <words>318</words>
Tiber smiled, a genuine, sardonic glee flickering in his eyes; the truth, like a well-designed paper airplane, was about to take flight. <words>336</words>
He knew, with chilling certainty, that this facility held more than just failed experiments; it held secrets, and he, the vigilant orchardist, was about to expose them all. <words>354</words>
His wife would have been proud. <words>361</words>
