Old Man Tiber, a bluffing swindler with a reputation built on smoke and mirrors, hadn’t felt energetically lethargic in decades, not since the Collapse. <16> He sat amongst the gnarled apple trees, remnants of a reclaimed orchard stubbornly growing within the skeletal remains of the toppled Zenith Tower, a monument to a forgotten ambition. <34> Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight piercing the fractured concrete, illuminating a small table where he displayed his wares – mostly salvaged trinkets and carefully curated illusions. <54> He was waiting for the instant his ancient computer, a relic he’d painstakingly kept alive, finally restarted, a signal from…well, from them. <71> 

The screen flickered, groaned, and then, with a burst of static, sprang to life, displaying a single line of code. <84> Simultaneously, a young woman, Elara, stumbled, dropping a thick, leather-bound book at his feet. <97> It landed with a soft thud, pages fluttering open to reveal intricate diagrams of energy fields. <111> “Oh, bother,” she mumbled, kneeling to gather her things, her eyes meeting Tiber’s. <126> This was the meet-cute, orchestrated, of course, by his invisible allies – the echoes of Zenith’s original architects, bound to the place and desperate for someone to understand what they’d built. <151>

He pointed to a tarnished silver locket, attached to which was a blank price tag. <164> “A curious piece, isn’t it?” he rasped, his voice roughened by years of dust and deception. <178> “Its value…is determined by what *you* believe it’s worth.” <190> It was a small test, a way to gauge her receptiveness. <199> Elara, surprisingly, didn’t scoff at the obvious con. <208> Instead, she picked up the locket, her fingers tracing the intricate carvings. <220> “It feels…charged,” she said, her voice barely a whisper. <230>

Tiber subtly began to magnetize a small piece of scrap metal with a hidden device in his cane, a trick he’d perfected over decades. <249> It wasn’t about the metal, though; it was about focusing her attention, creating a conduit. <261> “Zenith wasn’t just a building, child,” he said, his gentle harshness a carefully honed tool. <276> “It was a resonator, designed to…bare a truth no one dared to handle – the fragility of reality itself.” <296> The architects, his allies, were feeding him information, guiding his words. <308> 

Elara’s eyes widened as she understood. <314> The book, the orchard, the tower, Tiber himself – all pieces of a puzzle designed to awaken someone capable of seeing beyond the veil. <336> “They want me to fix it,” she breathed, looking around at the decaying structure. <348> “To stabilize the resonance.” <354> Tiber nodded, a flicker of something akin to hope in his weary eyes. <366> He’d spent a lifetime swindling people, but this…this was different. <376> This wasn’t about profit; it was about fulfilling a promise to ghosts, about finally using his skills for something real. <396> The truth, finally, was about to be unveiled. <402>
