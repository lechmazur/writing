Old Man Tiber, a jaded bartender with eyes that had seen too much fizzle, polished a glass, the crystal growing laboratory humming around him like a restless beast. <31> He wasn’t a scientist, not anymore, but Elias Vance, the lab’s eccentric founder, had insisted Tiber keep the place tidy, and listen. <49> It was in the final stillness before the city’s fireworks ignited, a pregnant pause mirroring the one in Tiber’s own life. <66> Vance believed the universe spoke in patterns, and tonight, he was convinced those patterns resided in the overlapping doodles on decades of bar receipts. <88> He’d tasked Tiber with finding connections, a genuinely strange request even for Vance. <103>

“Fate isn’t a line, Tiber,” Vance had rasped, “it’s a palimpsest.” <114> Now, Vance was gone, leaving behind only the lab, the receipts, and a bloodstained medical scalpel resting on his workbench – a relic from a past he’d never fully explained. <138> Tiber picked up the scalpel, its cold weight a stark contrast to the warm glow of the growing crystals. <151> He felt a desperate optimism bloom within him; Vance hadn’t just been studying doodles, he’d been trying to *understand* the past, to challenge fate itself. <172>

He spread the receipts across a light table, the scribbled lines forming a chaotic map. <184> Slowly, painstakingly, he began to compare them, noticing recurring motifs – spirals, broken circles, a peculiar three-pointed star. <204> Vance had theorized that these weren’t random, but echoes of choices made, timelines shifted, possibilities glimpsed. <223> He believed he could globalize this understanding, create a system to predict, and perhaps even alter, future events. <241> 

Tiber found a cluster of receipts from the year Vance’s wife disappeared, the doodles there frantic and jagged, mirroring the scalpel’s sharp edge. <264> A connection sparked – the three-pointed star appeared repeatedly, always near dates relating to a specific shipping route. <281> Could Vance have been searching for her, not through investigation, but through the language of fate itself? <295> The fireworks began to explode outside, painting the lab in fleeting bursts of color, but Tiber barely noticed. <311> He had a feeling, a fragile hope, that he was finally beginning to decipher Vance’s strange, desperate message. <327> The past wasn’t fixed, he realized, it was a conversation, and he, Tiber, was now a part of it. <343> He would continue, driven by the optimistic desperation to understand, to challenge, to *change*. <358> The scalpel felt less like a weapon, and more like a key. <366>
