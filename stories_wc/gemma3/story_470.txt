Old Man Tiber, the practical bard of Aethelburg, barely registered the vibrant chaos of the street fairs above as he descended into the *Leviathan*, a steampunk submarine repurposed as a library. <17> The air within smelled of oiled brass, aged paper, and a peculiar, metallic tang he’d grown to love. <28> He wasn’t here for leisure, though the sheer volume of forgotten lore always tempted him; he was here to *accept* a responsibility, a burden whispered about in hushed tones amongst the city’s scholars. <44> Tiber wasn’t known for grand pronouncements or heroic deeds, but for his precisely imperfect memory – he remembered details others missed, flaws in logic, the subtle shifts in a story’s telling. <63> It was a peculiar talent, dismissed by most as eccentricity, but vital for his true ambition: to become a guardian of ancient wisdom. <78> 

He found Master Elmsworth, the *Leviathan’s* curator, amidst towering shelves, meticulously cataloging scrolls. <90> “You received the signal, then?” Elmsworth asked, handing Tiber a small, ornate box. <101> Inside, nestled on velvet, lay a single, stripped screw. <111> It seemed an odd key, but Tiber understood; it fit the locking mechanism of a hidden compartment within Elmsworth’s personal desk. <129> The desk, a marvel of gears and polished wood, held the last journal of Archivist Bellweather, a woman who’d dedicated her life to preserving knowledge lost to time. <149> 

Tiber located the almost invisible seam, and with a delicate touch, inserted the screw. <162> A section of the desk slid open, revealing a secret diary bound in dragonhide. <176> Bellweather’s entries spoke of a looming darkness, a forgetting that threatened to consume all history, and a network of ‘Keepers’ tasked with safeguarding crucial fragments. <198> Her final entry detailed a prophecy, a warning about a rising tide of misinformation, and a plea for someone with a “mind for the cracks” to continue her work. <223> 

A breathless longing filled Tiber; this wasn’t about glory, but about preventing the slow erosion of truth. <238> He traced the faded ink, feeling the weight of Bellweather’s legacy settle upon his shoulders. <251> The street fairs, with their fleeting joys, seemed distant and unimportant. <262> He wasn’t a warrior or a mage, just a bard with a peculiar talent and a precisely imperfect memory, but he would accept the mantle of Keeper. <283> He would safeguard the wisdom within, one flawed recollection at a time, ensuring the past wasn’t lost to the future. <298> The *Leviathan* felt less like a library and more like a sanctuary, a silent promise whispered in the depths. <314>
