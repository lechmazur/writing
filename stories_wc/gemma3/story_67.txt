Old Man Tiber, a jovial blacksmith despite everything, hadn’t felt joy in decades, not since Elara left. <words>14</words>
He sat amongst the dust and discarded dreams of Silas Blackwood, a contraption inventor whose attic smelled of ozone and regret. <words>27</words>
Tiber wasn’t here for invention, though; he was here to endure, to witness the final wave from the departing train window, the one that carried his granddaughter, Wren, away. <words>43</words>
He’d agreed to Silas’s peculiar request – to time his grief, to measure it, to *control* it – by the motion of a metronome ticking steadily in the corner. <words>61</words>
Silas believed the human condition was a flawed mechanism, prone to catastrophic failure, and Tiber, precariously confident in his ability to withstand anything, was the test subject. <words>82</words>
He held a single earring, silver and shaped like a swallow in flight, Elara’s earring, the last tangible piece of her he possessed. <words>99</words>
Each tick of the metronome was a breath, a heartbeat, a moment Wren was further away, and Tiber focused on the cold metal, refusing to let the sorrow overwhelm him. <words>119</words>
Silas, in his fervent indifference, had declared that darkness could be tamed, quantified, and ultimately, overcome with enough precise measurement. <words>138</words>
Tiber didn’t believe in taming darkness, but he understood the need to *prove* it could be done, to offer Wren a world where grief didn’t consume. <words>158</words>
The train blurred into a streak of color, and with each swing of the metronome’s pendulum, Tiber cataloged the ache in his chest, the tightening in his jaw. <words>178</words>
He wasn’t fighting the sadness, merely observing it, dissecting it like a blacksmith would a flawed piece of metal, seeking the point of weakness. <words>197</words>
He’d spent a lifetime shaping iron, bending it to his will, and now he would attempt to shape his grief, to forge it into something bearable. <words>217</words>
The metronome clicked on, a relentless rhythm against the silence, a counterpoint to the fading echo of the train whistle. <words>235</words>
Silas watched, scribbling furiously in a notebook filled with diagrams and equations, convinced he was on the verge of a breakthrough. <words>254</words>
Tiber didn’t care about breakthroughs; he cared about Wren, about her inheriting a world where even loss could be…contained. <words>273</words>
He traced the curve of the swallow on the earring, a tiny, silver promise against the vastness of his sorrow. <words>289</words>
The metronome continued its steady beat, a mechanical heartbeat in the dusty attic, a testament to a blacksmith’s enduring love and a grandfather’s desperate hope. <words>308</words>
It wasn’t about conquering darkness, Tiber realized, but about learning to dance with it, to endure its rhythm, one tick at a time. <words>327</words>
He closed his eyes, the image of Wren’s face imprinted on his eyelids, and continued to breathe with the metronome, a quiet defiance against the encroaching night. <words>346</words>
The earring felt cool against his palm, a small weight anchoring him to a world that felt increasingly distant. <words>360</words>
