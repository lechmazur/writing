Old Man Tiber, a desert wanderer weathered like sandstone, squinted through the viewport of the space pirate ship *Stardust’s Lament’s* crow’s nest. <words>17</words>
It was the precise moment when the orchard’s last apple finally fell on Xylos, a signal relayed across the galactic net – the designated time to begin. <words>31</words>
He wasn’t interested in plunder, not anymore; his motivation was to archive sacred knowledge, fragments of lost civilizations scattered amongst the stars. <words>47</words>
His current research focused on the ‘Echoes of Aethel,’ a species rumored to have encoded their entire emotional lexicon into objects. <words>63</words>
Tiber held a brass ruler, cool against his calloused palm, believing it to be one such vessel – a key to translated love. <words>79</words>
It wasn’t the ruler’s material value that mattered, but its authentically artificial construction, a paradox hinting at Aethelian ingenuity. <words>96</words>
The Aethelians hadn’t *felt* love, not as humans understood it; they’d *constructed* it, meticulously defining its parameters and then manifesting it. <words>114</words>
Tiber’s method wasn’t archaeological excavation, but investigating everyday miracles – the way light refracted through nebulae, the predictable chaos of asteroid fields, the improbable bloom of space orchids. <words>134</words>
He believed these phenomena held echoes of Aethelian algorithms, subtle signatures of their engineered emotions. <words>148</words>
He’d spent decades calibrating his instruments, searching for resonance between the ruler and these cosmic events. <words>163</words>
Today, the falling apple on Xylos wasn’t just a seasonal occurrence; it was a calculated data point, a planetary heartbeat. <words>179</words>
As the signal peaked, the ruler warmed, and faint glyphs shimmered across its surface, not etched, but *grown* from the brass itself. <words>196</words>
They weren’t a language Tiber recognized, but a complex series of geometric patterns, a visual representation of emotional architecture. <words>213</words>
He recorded the data, a loaded curiosity driving his every action, knowing he was witnessing something profoundly alien and beautiful. <words>230</words>
The Aethelians hadn’t sought to *experience* love, but to understand its mechanics, to deconstruct and rebuild it in their own image. <words>248</words>
Tiber wondered if their pursuit had been successful, or if their authentically artificial emotions were ultimately hollow. <words>264</words>
He continued to document the glyphs, each pulse of data a step closer to deciphering the Echoes of Aethel, archiving a love born not of the heart, but of the mind. <words>284</words>
The *Stardust’s Lament* drifted silently, a vessel of piracy repurposed for the preservation of a forgotten, engineered tenderness. <words>301</words>
He knew this was just one piece of a vast puzzle, but with each everyday miracle investigated, the Aethelians’ translated love became a little less alien, a little more understood. <words>322</words>
The ruler pulsed again, a soft, brassy warmth, and Tiber smiled, a genuine emotion in a universe increasingly defined by the artificial. <words>339</words>
He had a feeling the orchard’s apples held more secrets than anyone imagined. <words>353</words>
His work was far from over. <words>359</words>
