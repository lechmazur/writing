Old Man Tiber, a secretive conjurer known more for his calculated dreams than actual magic, adjusted his spectacles within the sterile white halls of the Xylosian Embassy. <words>17</words>
He was here, before the first dance began – a diplomatic prelude to full interspecies relations – not for treaties, but to harness the power of the planet’s bioluminescent flora. <words>32</words>
Tiber, however, was philosophically shallow, believing power was simply *there*, waiting to be taken, not understood. <words>46</words>
He clutched a threadbare washcloth, surprisingly important to his task, its faded floral pattern a stark contrast to the embassy’s chrome and crystal. <words>62</words>
His method involved an heirloom piece of jewelry, a silver locket containing a miniature portrait of his grandmother, a woman rumored to speak with trees. <words>79</words>
He’d discovered the locket didn’t just *hold* a story, it *was* a story, resonating with the natural energies of any world. <words>95</words>
Opening the locket now, before the Xylosian dignitaries arrived, he focused on the image, letting its quiet narrative fill his mind. <words>111</words>
The locket warmed, and a faint green glow emanated from the washcloth, responding to the energy. <words>125</words>
He intended to tame the wild energy of the Xylosian Glow-vines, to bend them to his will, to create a power source for Earth. <words>141</words>
But as the glow intensified, he saw not just energy, but images within the light – the vines’ slow, patient growth, their interconnectedness, their quiet joy. <words>159</words>
His grandmother’s face in the locket seemed to soften, a subtle disapproval in her painted eyes. <words>173</words>
He realized, with a jolt, that the washcloth wasn’t a tool, but a conduit, meant to *receive* the vines’ energy, not steal it. <words>190</words>
It was a gesture of offering, of understanding, a first layer of compassion he hadn’t considered. <words>205</words>
The Xylosian ambassador, a being of shimmering light, approached, sensing the shift in Tiber’s intent. <words>221</words>
“You seek to control,” the ambassador stated, its voice a melodic chime, “or to listen?” <words>235</words>
Tiber, humbled, offered the glowing washcloth, a symbol of his changing purpose. <words>249</words>
He understood, finally, that true power wasn’t about domination, but about the layers of compassion needed to connect with something truly alien. <words>268</words>
The ambassador accepted the cloth, and the embassy pulsed with a harmonious green light, a promise of a future built not on control, but on shared understanding. <words>288</words>
The dance could begin, not as a prelude to conquest, but as a celebration of connection. <words>303</words>
Tiber, still philosophically shallow, but slightly less so, smiled, a genuine emotion flickering across his face. <words>318</words>
He had, unexpectedly, found a way to harness nature, not through force, but through a grandmother’s story and a threadbare cloth. <words>336</words>
The locket cooled, its task complete, a silent testament to the power of unexpected compassion. <words>351</words>
He felt a strange sense of peace, a feeling he hadn’t known he was missing. <words>365</words>
Perhaps, he mused, there were layers to himself he hadn’t yet discovered. <words>377</words>
