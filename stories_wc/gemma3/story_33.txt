Old Man Tiber, a solitary birdwatcher more comfortable with feathered silence than human chatter, adjusted the mask made from shattered porcelain shards, its edges biting softly into his skin. <words>22</words>
He felt anxiously relaxed, a peculiar state he’d cultivated over decades spent observing the precise, brutal order of nature. <words>34</words>
Today, however, order was…kilter. <words>38</words>
He stood in the leaf classification office, a sterile room usually dedicated to the meticulous cataloging of autumnal decay, but currently experiencing a cosmic blink – a fleeting moment where realities blurred. <words>58</words>
Sunlight fractured through a temporary distortion in the ceiling, casting ghostlike reflections on the polished marble floor, and it was *through* these shimmering images that Tiber intended to make his statement. <words>78</words>
His motivation wasn’t malice, but a braided bitterness towards a universe that demanded conformity. <words>90</words>
He believed cosmic chaos was a birthright, stolen by the relentless march of categorization and control, and he aimed to reclaim it. <words>106</words>
The porcelain mask wasn’t for disguise, but for disruption; each shard a tiny fracture in the expected, a miniature rebellion against smooth surfaces. <words>123</words>
He began a slow, deliberate dance, his movements mirroring the distorted reflections, each step a subtle defiance of gravity and expectation. <words>139</words>
He wasn’t trying to *do* anything, not in the conventional sense; he was simply *being* chaos, allowing it to manifest through his form. <words>156</words>
The office’s rigid systems – the filing cabinets, the specimen drawers, the very air conditioning – seemed to hum with discomfort. <words>170</words>
Tiber understood the power of nonviolence wasn’t about avoiding conflict, but about refusing to participate in its logic. <words>186</words>
He wasn’t fighting the universe, he was reminding it of its inherent wildness, its capacity for beautiful, unpredictable change. <words>203</words>
The reflections on the marble floor began to coalesce, forming fleeting images of untamed forests, swirling galaxies, and birds taking flight in impossible formations. <words>223</words>
A young intern, entering with a stack of leaf samples, paused, momentarily stunned, then simply smiled, a flicker of understanding in her eyes. <words>242</words>
She didn’t question the dance, the mask, or the distorted reality; she simply felt the shift, the loosening of control. <words>258</words>
Tiber continued, his anxious relaxation deepening, knowing that even a cosmic blink could plant a seed of rebellion. <words>274</words>
He wasn’t seeking to destroy order, only to remind it that chaos was its necessary companion, its vital breath. <words>291</words>
The reflections intensified, then faded as the cosmic blink ended, leaving the leaf classification office seemingly unchanged, yet subtly, irrevocably altered. <words>311</words>
Tiber lowered his gaze, a ghost of a smile playing on his lips, the porcelain shards cool against his skin, his birthright momentarily asserted. <words>328</words>
He was, after all, just a birdwatcher, observing the delicate balance of a universe constantly on the verge of falling beautifully apart. <words>346</words>
