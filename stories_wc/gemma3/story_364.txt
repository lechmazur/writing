Old Man Tiber, a skewed visionary employed by the temporal anomaly study, hadn’t spoken a full sentence in years. <words>13</words>
He communicated solely by arranging botanical sketches – pressed ferns, meticulously rendered dandelion clocks, the ghost of a rose – on the chipped Formica table. <words>28</words>
His current obsession, fueled by the hush of a silent revolution brewing outside the study’s reinforced windows, was documenting vanishing trades. <words>43</words>
He wanted to photograph the last lamplighter, the final hand-letterer, the last person who could truly sharpen a pencil with a knife. <words>59</words>
Tiber believed these skills weren’t simply *lost*, but fading from timelines subtly altered by the study’s work. <words>73</words>
Dr. Aris Thorne, the lead researcher, found Tiber’s methods…unconventional, but undeniably effective. <words>86</words>
Today, Tiber was attempting to advise her on locating a master glassblower rumored to exist only in fractured moments. <words>101</words>
He did so not with words, but by carefully aligning fragments of broken pottery, each piece bearing smudged hieroglyphs. <words>117</words>
The hieroglyphs weren’t Egyptian, or Sumerian, or anything Aris recognized; they were cryptically clear, yet utterly alien. <words>132</words>
“You’re saying…the sequence of floral depictions corresponds to a specific arrangement of these shards?” Aris asked, already knowing the answer. <words>149</words>
Tiber simply rearranged a sketch of bindweed, its tendrils mirroring a particularly jagged edge of pottery. <words>164</words>
The anomaly study’s purpose was reexamining the familiar, looking for the cracks in reality where time bled into itself. <words>181</words>
Aris had initially dismissed the pottery as archaeological debris, but Tiber saw it as a map, a key to navigating temporal distortions. <words>197</words>
He believed the glassblower’s workshop existed within a pocket of stabilized time, accessible only by following the patterns encoded in the shards. <words>214</words>
“The smudges aren’t random,” Tiber’s sketches seemed to say, “they’re echoes of the craftsman’s breath, the heat of the furnace.” <words>231</words>
Aris, skeptical yet intrigued, prepared the temporal scanner, inputting the coordinates derived from Tiber’s arrangement. <words>247</words>
The scanner hummed, then displayed a location: a seemingly ordinary alleyway in present-day Prague. <words>261</words>
It was a mundane miracle, a glimpse into a world where forgotten skills still flickered, preserved by the strange logic of time. <words>278</words>
Aris adjusted her camera, ready to document the vanishing trade, guided by the silent wisdom of a skewed visionary and the whispers of broken pottery. <words>296</words>
She knew, with a growing certainty, that Tiber wasn’t just seeing anomalies; he was *feeling* them, understanding the subtle shifts in the fabric of reality. <words>314</words>
The revolution outside felt distant now, irrelevant compared to the quiet persistence of a craftsman shaping glass across the currents of time. <words>331</words>
It was a small thing, a single workshop, but it felt like a victory against the inevitable entropy of the universe. <words>347</words>
Tiber offered her a final sketch: a single, perfect bloom, a silent benediction. <words>362</words>
Aris smiled, and stepped into the alleyway. <words>368</words>
