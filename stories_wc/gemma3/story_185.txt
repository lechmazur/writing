Old Man Tiber, a peculiar collector of forgotten things, sat infuriatingly calm amidst the humming servers of the Probability Mapping Center. <words>17</words>
He wasn’t interested in predicting futures, only excavating pasts – specifically, the buried talents of those lost to time. <words>28</words>
His current obsession centered on a chipped, old pencil stub, no longer than his thumb, found within the ruins of a library that hadn’t existed for millennia. <words>42</words>
The pencil, he believed, had belonged to Anya, a composer whose symphonies were rumored to have shaped the very fabric of reality, then deliberately erased. <words>57</words>
Tiber’s motivation wasn’t academic; he was preparing to make a final stand against the Erasers, beings dedicated to maintaining a bland, predictable universe. <words>72</words>
He’d spent decades decoding the arrangement of keys left in a dusty piano bench recovered from Anya’s former home, a method he’d discovered through fragmented temporal echoes. <words>89</words>
Each key corresponded to a note, but also to a specific probability pathway, a potential life Anya *could* have lived. <words>104</words>
Tiber would tweak the arrangement, subtly altering the past, hoping to unlock Anya’s full potential and unleash her music once more. <words>118</words>
The Center’s screens displayed swirling nebulae of possibilities, each shift in the keys causing ripples across millennia. <words>131</words>
He wasn’t trying to *change* the past, but to *reveal* a past that had been suppressed, a symphony stifled before its crescendo. <words>146</words>
“Fractured grace,” he murmured, watching a new pathway bloom on the screen, a life where Anya wasn’t silenced, but celebrated. <words>160</words>
The pencil stub warmed in his hand, a conduit to Anya’s forgotten energy. <words>168</words>
He adjusted a chipped ivory key, a minor alteration, yet the probability matrix shuddered. <words>181</words>
The Erasers would sense this, of course; they always did. <words>189</words>
But Tiber wasn’t afraid. <words>192</words>
He’d spent lifetimes preparing, collecting fragments, understanding the delicate dance between fate and free will. <words>206</words>
He knew Anya’s music wasn’t just sound; it was a weapon, a force capable of shattering the Erasers’ control. <words>220</words>
Another tweak, another ripple, and a faint melody began to echo within the Center, a ghostly fragment of a lost symphony. <words>236</words>
The screens flared, displaying a cascade of vibrant possibilities, a universe overflowing with unrealized potential. <words>250</words>
Tiber smiled, a rare and beautiful sight. <words>255</words>
The Erasers were coming, he could feel it, but he was ready. <words>263</words>
He held the pencil stub aloft, a tiny beacon of hope in the face of oblivion. <words>273</words>
Anya’s music swelled, filling the Probability Mapping Center with a fractured, glorious grace. <words>287</words>
It was a sound that had been silent for millennia, and it was finally, beautifully, being heard. <words>301</words>
The final stand had begun, not with a bang, but with a song. <words>310</words>
He continued to tweak, refining the arrangement, amplifying the melody, strengthening Anya’s resurrected talent. <words>326</words>
The universe held its breath, waiting to hear the full symphony. <words>334</words>
The Erasers arrived, but the music was already too strong. <words>342</words>
Anya’s buried talent, unleashed across millennia, was rewriting reality itself. <words>353</words>
And Old Man Tiber, the peculiar collector, simply continued to listen, infuriatingly calm. <words>366</words>
