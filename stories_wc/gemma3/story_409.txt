Old Man Tiber, a bruised fighter whose nose had been broken more times than he could recall, traced the chipped edge of the clay pot shard. <words>17</words>
The inscription, barely visible, spoke of unwavering conviction – a concept he’d long abandoned in the smoky rings of the arena. <words>29</words>
He was, by all accounts, skillfully incompetent at everything *except* breaking faces, a talent that had earned him little but regret. <words>43</words>
Today, though, wasn’t about regret; it was about extinguishing the last vestige of self-deception in a man named Alistair Finch. <words>58</words>
Finch, a celebrated sculptor, was at this very moment striking his chisel into a block of Carrara marble, attempting to capture… what? Perfection? Tiber scoffed. <words>74</words>
The dusty attic, crammed with clockwork animals frozen mid-leap and whirring softly, felt like a forgotten lung of the city. <words>89</words>
It was here, amongst the gears and grime, that Tiber could access the pathways between waking and sleep, the forgotten dreams. <words>105</words>
He intended to abduct Finch, not physically, but through those dreams, to show him the hollowness of his pursuit. <words>119</words>
Tiber focused, the shard warming in his palm, and reached for Finch’s subconscious. <words>128</words>
He didn’t want to harm Finch, only to dismantle the carefully constructed illusion of artistic integrity, the belief that beauty could absolve all sins. <words>146</words>
Within Finch’s dreamscape, Tiber manifested as a broken automaton, mirroring the sculptor’s own fractured ideals. <words>159</words>
He showed Finch visions of the arena, the cheers turning to jeers, the fleeting glory dissolving into lasting pain – a truth Finch desperately avoided in his pristine studio. <words>178</words>
“You stand for nothing but the appearance of something,” Tiber rasped, his voice echoing through the dream-attic. <words>190</words>
Finch, initially defiant, began to crumble under the weight of the presented reality, the marble dust of his dream turning to ash. <words>206</words>
Tiber wasn’t seeking redemption for himself, but a shared reckoning; a dismantling of the lies they both told themselves. <words>221</words>
He wanted Finch to understand that even skillful incompetence held more honesty than a flawlessly sculpted falsehood. <words>236</words>
The chisel in Finch’s dream hand faltered, then dropped, the marble remaining stubbornly unyielding. <words>248</words>
Back in the real world, Finch paused, his hand hovering over the stone, a flicker of doubt crossing his face. <words>263</words>
Tiber felt a loosening of the grip, a surrender to the uncomfortable truth. <words>272</words>
It wasn’t about stopping the art, but about forcing Finch to *mean* something with it, to stand for something real. <words>288</words>
The shard cooled in Tiber’s hand, its purpose served. <words>296</words>
He’d spent his life absorbing blows, and now, finally, he’d delivered one that mattered. <words>308</words>
The clockwork animals continued their silent dance, oblivious to the subtle shift in the world. <words>320</words>
Perhaps, Tiber thought, even a bruised fighter could leave a mark. <words>329</words>
He had, after all, forced a reckoning, a moment of brutal honesty in a world obsessed with illusion. <words>343</words>
The weight of years lifted slightly, replaced by a quiet, unexpected peace. <words>355</words>
It wasn’t victory, but it was… enough. <words>362</words>
