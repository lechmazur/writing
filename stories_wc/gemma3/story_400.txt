Old Man Tiber, a druid more bark than blossom these days, surveyed the glacial orchard, its stunted apple trees clinging to the ice cliffs above a chasm of impossible blue. <16> He hadn’t spoken a true word in seventy years, not since the last human footfall echoed into silence on Earth, and found a peculiar comfort in the quiet. <32> Today, though, was his birthday, and tradition demanded a meal – a grim, solitary affair, but tradition nonetheless. <48> He began to gather the frost-bitten apples, their skins like aged parchment, a task he approached with fiercely ambivalent feelings. <64> He resented the forced remembrance, the annual prodding of a heart long turned to stone, yet the ritual felt…necessary. <79> 

He’d found the safety pin years ago, a dull, tarnished thing amongst the wreckage of a forgotten settlement, and kept it tucked into the woven bark of his staff. <97> It wasn’t useful for much, certainly not for mending, but it was a tangible link to a past he simultaneously mourned and rejected. <114> The meal itself was simple: roasted root vegetables, preserved berries, and the bitter apples, all arranged on a slab of ice. <130> As he prepared it, a tremor ran through the orchard, a common occurrence, but this one felt…different. <146> He glanced into the crevasse, the blue ice seeming to pulse with a faint, internal light. <161>

He sat, the meal before him, the safety pin cold against his palm. <174> The silence pressed in, heavier than usual. <181> He hadn’t realized how much he *relied* on it, how it shielded him from the echoing emptiness within. <198> His crippling fear wasn’t of loneliness, but of what might fill the void if he allowed a sound, a word, to escape. <216> He picked up the safety pin, turning it over and over. <224> 

Then, a sound, a rasping croak, tore from his throat. <234> “Apples,” he managed, the word brittle and unused. <242> Another tremor, stronger this time, and a single, perfect bloom appeared on a nearby branch, a splash of crimson against the white. <261> He spoke again, “Good…apples.” <269> Each word was a struggle, a breaking of ancient ice within his own soul. <284> He continued, haltingly describing the meal, the orchard, the blue ice, the pin, the years. <302> The orchard responded, the blooms multiplying, the blue light intensifying. <313> It wasn’t joy he felt, not exactly, but a dour amusement at the sheer audacity of breaking the silence, and the world blooming in response. <333> He gathered his courage, and spoke of his fear, finally letting it go. <346> The crevasse glowed, and for the first time in decades, Tiber smiled. <357> The meal tasted…almost sweet. <363>
