Old Man Tiber, a frail guard more accustomed to counting seabirds than confronting threats, shivered despite the thick wool cloak draped around his shoulders. <words>17</words>
The tidal island of Aethel, normally bustling throughout sorting season, felt eerily quiet this year, the usual clamor of merchants and hopeful initiates muted by a pervasive dread. <words>33</words>
He clutched a sour-smelling alchemy phial, its contents a volatile concoction rumored to dissolve even stone, a desperate measure for a desperate man. <words>49</words>
Tiber was resolutely wavering, his loyalty to the Citadel fractured by the messages he’d been receiving – messages carved in tree bark, hidden within the gnarled roots of the island’s ancient oaks. <words>68</words>
These weren’t orders, but pleas, warnings about the “sorting” being a sham, a carefully orchestrated selection process designed not for aptitude, but for predetermined fate. <words>87</words>
He’d spent decades enforcing the Citadel’s will, ensuring each young hopeful was assigned their role, believing in the painted allegiances of order and purpose. <words>106</words>
Now, the bark-messages, penned by a former sorter who’d vanished years ago, revealed a darker truth: the Citadel didn’t *find* destinies, it *created* them, molding individuals to fit its needs. <words>127</words>
Tiber’s own grandson, Elian, was due to be sorted tomorrow, and the messages indicated Elian was slated for the Obsidian Guard – a life of brutal servitude and certain death. <words>148</words>
He had to intervene, to break the cycle, even if it meant betraying everything he’d ever known. <words>161</words>
The head sorter, a woman named Lyra, approached, her smile as cold and polished as the obsidian she favored. <words>176</words>
“Everything prepared, Tiber?” she asked, her voice like the grinding of stones. <words>186</words>
He nodded, his hand tightening around the phial, a plan forming in his mind, fueled by a hopeful melancholy. <words>201</words>
As Lyra turned to inspect the sorting chamber, Tiber acted, a sudden, desperate yank on the lever controlling the island’s protective barrier. <words>217</words>
The barrier flickered, weakened, allowing a small vessel – a smuggler’s skiff – to slip through the turbulent waters. <words>233</words>
It was a signal, arranged through the bark-messages, a chance for Elian to escape. <words>246</words>
Lyra whirled around, her eyes blazing with fury, but Tiber stood firm, a frail figure defying an empire. <words>261</words>
“They deserve a choice,” he rasped, “not a painted destiny.” <words>271</words>
He knew his actions would likely cost him his life, but the thought of Elian breathing free, choosing his own path, filled him with a fragile peace. <words>291</words>
The alchemy phial remained clutched in his hand, a symbol of his defiance, a last resort should Lyra attempt to restore the barrier. <words>307</words>
He watched as a small figure, undoubtedly Elian, scrambled aboard the skiff, disappearing into the mist, a beacon of hope against the darkening sky. <words>327</words>
The island, once a prison, now offered a path to freedom, carved not in stone, but in the living wood of rebellion. <words>343</words>
Tiber braced himself, accepting his fate with a quiet dignity, a frail guard who dared to dream of a different world for his grandson. <words>362</words>
