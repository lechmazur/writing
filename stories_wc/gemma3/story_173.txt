Old Man Tiber, a wandering orchardist more comfortable amongst root and bloom than people, traced the chipped Formica of the kitchen table, a habit born of decades spent sharing cider and stories with travelers. <30> He wasn’t seeking company now, though, only clarity as he prepared to reclaim something lost – a vital nexus point for interdimensional trade routes. <49> The routes weren’t marked on charts, but woven into the very fabric of the multiverse, and Tiber, with his trustworthy unique ability to sense their flow, was the only one who could re-establish them. <74> His motivation wasn’t profit, but the preservation of connection, a bittersweet grit settling in his soul with each fractured pathway. <93>

The nexus resided within the forgotten underwater city hall of Aethelburg, a place existing simultaneously in countless realities, a shimmering ghost in the currents of possibility. <116> To reach it, he relied not on ships or submersibles, but on the touch of a phantom hand – a residual energy left by the city’s architect, a being who understood the multiverse as a garden to be tended. <143> Tiber carried with him a collection of dried leaves, each pressed from a tree growing on a different world, their brittle forms acting as keys to unlock the architect’s lingering influence. <168> 

He descended, the water around him not cold, but… expectant, the city hall looming like a skeletal whale. <187> Inside, the grand hall was eerily preserved, documents floating in suspended animation, portraits gazing out with vacant eyes. <206> Tiber spread the leaves across the massive, barnacle-encrusted kitchen table at the hall’s center, each leaf resonating with a specific frequency. <228> As he touched them, a spectral hand, translucent and cool, materialized, guiding his own, tracing lines of energy across the table’s surface. <251> 

“Kitchen table wisdom,” he murmured, a phrase the architect had once whispered to him across realities, “the simplest things hold the greatest power.” <271> The phantom hand solidified the fractured routes, weaving them back into a coherent network, a shimmering web visible only to Tiber’s attuned senses. <293> It was a temporary fix, he knew, the multiverse constantly shifting, but it was enough. <306> He’d mapped the currents, ensured the flow, and could finally move on, another orchard to tend, another connection to nurture, carrying the bittersweet weight of infinite possibilities. <328> The phantom hand faded, leaving only the scent of brine and the rustling of dried leaves. <342> Tiber smiled, a small, weary gesture. <347> His work was never truly done. <351>
