Old Man Tiber, they called him, though he wasn’t particularly old, just…worn, a chef capable of tasting memories with every bite, stood in the hush of the stadium before the first pitch, a strange place to seek solace. <31>
He held a dull paperclip, twisting it between thumb and forefinger, a pathetic talisman against the ghosts he carried, hoping to appease them, or at least quiet their incessant chatter. <52>
The Yodeling Valley, his home, was renowned for its echoing acoustics and the peculiar, synthetically organic moss that grew on the cliffs, a moss that amplified emotions, making forgiveness nearly impossible. <78>
He’d come to the city, to this concrete bowl of anticipation, to sever the toxic ties that bound him to his brother, Silas, a bitterness that tasted like burnt sugar and regret. <104>
Tiber’s gift – or curse – meant every dish he created wasn’t just flavor, but a reliving of moments, and Silas’s last meal, a disastrous attempt at reconciliation, haunted every creation. <131>
He’d learned, over decades, to track rain trails, not on pavement, but on the emotional residue left by people, following the paths of sorrow and anger to understand their origins. <156>
Today, he wasn’t tracking someone else’s pain, but his own, retracing the steps that led to the final, fracturing argument with Silas, hoping to find a point of divergence, a chance for a different outcome. <186>
The paperclip, Silas had given it to him as a child, a symbol of their shared ingenuity, now felt like a tiny, metallic weight anchoring him to the past. <208>
He closed his eyes, focusing on the faint scent of ozone that always preceded a storm, a scent that mirrored the static charge of unresolved conflict. <231>
He tasted the memory of Silas’s laughter, then the sharp sting of his betrayal, the realization that Silas hadn’t wanted reconciliation, only validation of his own pain. <257>
A slow drizzle began, tracing paths down the stadium seats, and Tiber followed them with his mind, not seeking to change the past, but to understand it, to accept the imperfections of both himself and his brother. <286>
Forgiveness wasn’t about erasing the hurt, he realized, but about releasing the grip it had on him, allowing the rain to wash away the residue of resentment. <308>
He straightened, the paperclip still in his hand, no longer a weight, but a reminder of a flawed, complicated love, and a quiet acceptance settled over him, a ruminative exasperation giving way to a fragile peace. <336>
The first pitch was thrown, a crack of the bat, and Tiber finally tasted something new: the faint, hopeful flavor of letting go. <357>
