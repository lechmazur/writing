Old Man Tiber, a shifty caretaker with eyes that darted like trapped birds, hadn’t spoken a full sentence in years, not since the parole hearing’s final word – “Denied” – echoed in the hush of the courtroom. <31> He’d retreated to the abandoned drive-in movie theater, its screen a ghostly rectangle against the bruised twilight, and become its silent guardian. <52> His task, born of an anguished joy he couldn’t articulate, was to unify the fractured hearts of his estranged children, a task he believed hinged on something utterly bizarre: witnessing things mineralize. <78> 

He’d learned of this peculiar method from a traveling mystic, a woman who claimed sorrow could be transmuted into stone, but only if observed during specific, fleeting moments. <103> Tiber’s chosen method for finding these moments was to tail surreal circus caravans that vanished at dawn, leaving behind only dust and the faint scent of cotton candy. <129> He wasn’t interested in the spectacle, only in the residue, the strange energies that clung to the air where impossible acts had been performed. <151>

His most prized possession was a vintage microscope, salvaged from a forgotten science lab, its brass gleaming dully in the theater’s projection booth. <173> He used it not to examine cells, but to study the dust collected from the caravan routes, hoping to catch the precise moment of crystalline formation, the visible ‘mineralization’ of grief. <198> Tiber was, traditionally spontaneous, often abandoning his post for days, following a particularly vibrant plume of circus smoke, much to the annoyance of the local sheriff. <224> 

He believed that if he could document this process, show his children the beauty in decay, the right to fail and still become something enduring, they might finally understand each other, and him. <252> One morning, after a particularly vivid caravan featuring a woman who swallowed swords and a man who walked on air, he found it – a single grain of dust, under the microscope, blossoming into a miniature geode, radiating a soft, internal light. <284> It wasn’t a perfect crystal, flawed and asymmetrical, but it was *something*. <291> He carefully packaged it, a fragile offering, and prepared to finally face his children, hoping this small, mineralized piece of sorrow would be enough to bridge the years of silence. <321> He knew it wouldn’t erase the past, but perhaps, it would offer them permission to build a future, imperfections and all. <341> The dawn was breaking, painting the drive-in screen in shades of rose and gold, a silent promise of a new beginning. <361>
