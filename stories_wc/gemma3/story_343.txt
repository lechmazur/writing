Old Man Tiber, a melancholy jester with grease-stained motley, traced the rim of his chipped mug, the submarine’s rhythmic groaning a familiar lullaby. <18> The *Nautilus’* interior, all brass and bubbling gauges, smelled strongly of linseed oil – paint was drying on the newly reinforced hull plates. <32> He wasn’t supposed to be on duty; his ‘court’ – the submarine’s crew – had relegated him to observation during this crucial stage, deeming his presence ‘unhelpful’ to the structural integrity. <52> Tiber, however, held a more important task, one he pursued with crooked hope: restoring the ancient art of Hydromancy, a sacred practice lost to the age of steam. <71> 

He held a crumpled drawing, a faded schematic of a long-forgotten temple dedicated to the water spirits, found tucked within a salvaged automaton. <88> It was iconically unintentional – a child’s rendering, yet possessing a strange, compelling accuracy in its depiction of the temple’s energy flows. <106> Tiber believed the temple held the key to calming the increasingly erratic ocean currents, a problem threatening all submersible travel. <124> He wasn’t a scholar, merely a jester, but he’d discovered a peculiar talent: reading the future by analyzing the geometry of tea leaves. <143>

Today’s brew, a blend of salvaged spices and deep-sea kelp, swirled with unsettling patterns. <157> “Show me,” he murmured, a quiet command directed not at anyone present, but at the swirling sediment. <171> The leaves coalesced, forming a distorted image mirroring a section of the drawing. <186> He noticed a subtle misalignment, a geometric discordance between the temple’s depicted layout and the tea’s interpretation. <205> 

“The entrance… it’s not where they thought,” he muttered, sketching corrections onto the crumpled drawing with a charcoal stub. <224> Captain Eva Rostova, pragmatic and perpetually exasperated, scoffed from across the cabin. <238> “Still at it, Tiber? Divining the future with leaves? We need structural reports, not fairy tales.” <255> Tiber simply offered her a cup. <259> “Observe, Captain,” he said, pointing to the corrected drawing. “The geometry suggests a hidden chamber, a stabilizing nexus. Perhaps… common ground between our science and their spirit.” <284> Rostova, after a long, skeptical look, conceded, “Remarkable. The sonar *did* pick up an anomaly in that sector.” <301> A flicker of genuine hope crossed Tiber’s face; perhaps even a jester could mend a broken world, one tea leaf, and one corrected drawing, at a time. <320> The paint continued to dry, and the *Nautilus* prepared to descend. <334> The ocean awaited. <338>
