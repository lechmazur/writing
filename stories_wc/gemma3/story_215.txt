Father Michael, a rattled exorcist more accustomed to shadows than sequins, adjusted his tie, the silk feeling offensively frivolous amid the sterile halls of the Blackwood Institute for Psychic Research. <words>22</words>
He was, inwardly social despite his profession, and the forced cheer of his beginner’s waltz lessons felt like a particularly cruel penance. <words>36</words>
Dr. Aris Thorne, the Institute’s director, believed entangling science with wonder was the key to understanding the paranormal, and Michael, begrudgingly, was starting to see her point – though he’d never admit it with anything less than coy aggression. <words>57</words>
Thorne had tasked him with a peculiar assignment: to synthesize the fragmented memories of a recently deceased medium, using a series of puzzles hidden within the Institute itself. <words>73</words>
The first clue arrived as a vintage postcard, depicting a seaside resort in 1920s Brighton, addressed to a “Miss Evelyn Bellweather,” a name Michael recognized from the medium’s rambling final statements. <words>93</words>
The postcard’s seemingly innocuous image held a coded message, revealed only under ultraviolet light – a sequence of numbers corresponding to books in the Institute’s restricted library. <words>113</words>
Each book contained another puzzle, a riddle or a cipher, leading him deeper into Blackwood’s labyrinthine structure. <words>128</words>
He solved a logic problem concealed within a Victorian music box, then deciphered a botanical code hidden in a pressed flower collection, all while attempting to remember the steps to a box step. <words>149</words>
The puzzles weren’t merely intellectual exercises; they felt…guarded, as if Evelyn herself was controlling the flow of information, offering disclosures only to someone persistent enough to earn them. <words>171</words>
Finally, the last puzzle, a complex arrangement of tarot cards, revealed the location of a hidden room behind a seemingly solid wall in the Institute’s basement. <words>192</words>
Inside, the room wasn’t filled with occult artifacts, but with Evelyn’s research – meticulously documented experiments attempting to quantify psychic energy. <words>211</words>
Michael discovered Evelyn hadn’t been a passive conduit for spirits, but a scientist, using her abilities to gather data, carefully concealing her findings from a skeptical world. <words>233</words>
Her notes detailed a breakthrough – a method to amplify psychic signals, but also a warning: unchecked power could unravel the fabric of reality. <words>253</words>
The postcard wasn’t a clue to her past, but a message to the future, a plea for responsible exploration. <words>268</words>
Michael, the rattled exorcist, felt a strange kinship with the guarded scientist, a shared understanding of the delicate balance between belief and proof. <words>288</words>
He realized Thorne hadn’t just wanted him to access Evelyn’s memories, but to understand her motivations, to continue her work with caution and respect. <words>308</words>
Perhaps, he thought, a waltz wasn’t such a terrible penance after all, a grounding ritual before delving back into the ethereal. <words>326</words>
He carefully cataloged Evelyn’s research, a newfound purpose solidifying his resolve, ready to synthesize her legacy and protect the wonder she’d so fiercely guarded. <words>346</words>
The Institute, once a place of sterile observation, now felt charged with possibility, a testament to the power of entangling science and the unseen. <words>365</words>
