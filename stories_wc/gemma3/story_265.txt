Deputy Harding, an impassive man even to himself, checked the oil dipstick, the metallic scrape echoing strangely in the vast space. <words>14</words>
He performed oil changes not for the mechanics of it, but for the location: a lush orchard inexplicably growing within the skeletal remains of an abandoned cathedral, sunlight fracturing through stained glass onto blossoming boughs. <words>32</words>
It was during these mundane tasks he hoped to witness a moment of pure grace, a fleeting glimpse beyond the ordinary. <words>46</words>
Today, like every Tuesday, he methodically worked, his movements personally impersonal, a practiced detachment honed over years of quiet observation. <words>63</words>
He found a twisted twist tie snagged on the engine block, a small, metallic contortion that seemed to hum with a faint energy. <words>78</words>
Old Man Tiber, the orchard’s caretaker, claimed the cathedral held uncharted echoes, remnants of prayers and songs woven into the very stone and fruit. <words>96</words>
Harding didn’t believe in ghosts, but he believed in resonance, in the way things held onto moments. <words>109</words>
He began to stretch, a slow, deliberate movement, feeling the pull in his shoulders, and simultaneously, he began to communicate with the bees buzzing amongst the apple blossoms – with the secret language of bees, a series of subtle hand gestures Tiber had taught him. <words>134</words>
It wasn’t about understanding the bees, but about acknowledging the interconnectedness, the silent conversation happening all around. <words>149</words>
The bees responded, their buzzing intensifying, then shifting to a lower, almost mournful tone. <words>161</words>
Harding felt a prickling on his skin, a sense of something *listening*. <words>171</words>
He glanced towards the altar, now overgrown with vines, and saw a single shaft of sunlight illuminate a patch of ripe peaches. <words>188</words>
A young woman, dressed in white, walked into the light, her face serene, and began to gather the fruit, her movements fluid and unhurried. <words>207</words>
She didn’t seem to notice Harding, or the orchard, or even the cathedral itself; she was simply *present*, a quiet embodiment of peace. <words>225</words>
The bees fell silent. <words>229</words>
Harding continued his work, tightening a bolt, the metallic click a small counterpoint to the woman’s gentle movements. <words>245</words>
He didn’t analyze the moment, didn’t try to understand it; he simply allowed himself to witness it, the grace he’d been seeking unfolding before him. <words>265</words>
The twist tie, still clutched in his hand, felt warm. <words>273</words>
He finished the oil change, the engine purring smoothly, a mechanical heartbeat in the ancient space. <words>288</words>
As he walked away, he noticed a single peach lying on the hood of the car, perfectly formed, radiating a soft, golden light. <words>306</words>
The uncharted echoes, he realized, weren’t about the past, but about the potential for beauty in the present. <words>323</words>
He left the peach, a silent offering, and drove away, the image of the woman and the orchard imprinted on his mind, a cautious bravery settling in his chest. <words>343</words>
The orchard, and the cathedral, held their secrets, and Harding, the impassive deputy, had been allowed a glimpse. <words>360</words>
