Old Man Tiber, a humorless comedic actor famed for roles he never enjoyed, sat on a splintered swing set in the deserted playground, the wilderness pressing close like a forgotten memory. <30> He hadn’t sought this place; it had simply…accumulated around him through the hush of time’s unraveling tapestry, a consequence of perpetually not going anywhere else. <49> In his lap rested an inkwell, dried out and brittle, a birthday gift from a fan decades ago – one of many objectively personal offerings he’d never asked for. <71> He considered unwanted gifts a form of slow erosion, each one chipping away at the already minimal space he allowed for connection. <92> 

Tiber wasn’t interested in people, not really; he was interested in stars, specifically, in bottling a star’s dying breath. <109> It was a ridiculous ambition, he knew, but it occupied the persistent daydream loops that had become his primary reality. <128> In these loops, he’d constructed elaborate devices of glass and shadow, all powered by the inkwell, which, miraculously, always contained a shimmering, celestial fluid. <151> Today, however, the inkwell remained stubbornly empty, mirroring the hollowness he felt even within his fabricated worlds. <171>

He’d tried everything to coax it back to life – lunar alignments, whispered incantations, even attempting to replicate the fan’s earnest expression. <193> Nothing worked. <194> The playground, once vibrant with shrieks and laughter, now echoed only with the rustle of leaves and the distant cry of a hawk. <213> He imagined the star, a distant ember fading into the cosmic dark, its final sigh lost to the vastness. <233> 

Another daydream began, more vivid than the last, showing him successfully capturing the starlight, the inkwell overflowing with incandescent energy. <256> But this time, a small voice, suspiciously like his own, pointed out the futility of it all, the inherent loneliness of preserving something meant to dissipate. <281> He’d resisted that voice for years, but today, something shifted. <291> 

He looked at the dried inkwell, at the encroaching wilderness, at the decaying playground, and finally, he had to concede. <308> The star’s breath wasn’t meant to be bottled, and perhaps, neither was his own. <325> The daydream dissolved, leaving him with a strange, unfamiliar lightness, a quiet acceptance settling over him like the dusk. <344> He didn’t smile, of course; Old Man Tiber didn’t do smiles, but the tension in his shoulders eased, just a fraction. <363> The wilderness didn’t seem so threatening anymore, just…present. <370>
