Old Man Tiber, a begrudging guardian of the mechanical bird sanctuary, hadn’t smiled in decades. <words>13</words>
His days were spent winding gears and oiling wings, a monotonous rhythm within the folds of spacetime, a place where yesterday, today, and tomorrow blurred. <words>29</words>
He’d been tasked with maintaining the automatons, a penance for a life lived too rigidly within society’s grip. <words>42</words>
Then the postcards arrived, slipped into the sanctuary’s intake vents – dreamlike illustrations of an island bathed in perpetual twilight. <words>58</words>
Each card depicted scenes of unrestrained joy, people dancing with bioluminescent flora, children building castles from seafoam, a stark contrast to Tiber’s grey existence. <words>76</words>
The sender was unknown, yet the images felt…familiar, a forgotten echo of a life he’d once dreamed of. <words>89</words>
A dangerously friendly raven, one of the sanctuary’s more inquisitive creations, began collecting the postcards, arranging them on Tiber’s workbench. <words>106</words>
Tiber, initially annoyed, found himself drawn to the vibrant scenes, compelled to analyze every brushstroke, every impossible color. <words>121</words>
He began to see patterns, not in the art itself, but in the *way* the islanders lived – a complete rejection of schedules, rules, and expectations. <words>138</words>
One postcard showed a baker using a rustic bread paddle, not for kneading dough, but for conducting an orchestra of fireflies. <words>154</words>
The image sparked something within Tiber, a flicker of the joy he thought long extinguished. <words>166</words>
He hadn’t felt a genuine emotion since…well, he couldn’t remember. <words>176</words>
He started small, adjusting the birds’ flight patterns to be less precise, more whimsical, allowing them to deviate from their programmed routes. <words>192</words>
Then, he began to dismantle sections of the sanctuary’s rigid structure, replacing them with winding paths and overgrown gardens. <words>208</words>
The other caretakers protested, but Tiber, fueled by the postcards and a rediscovered purpose, simply ignored them. <words>223</words>
He realized the island wasn’t a place to *go* to, but a state of mind to *achieve*. <words>235</words>
Using the bread paddle – inexplicably appearing amongst his tools – he began to “illustrate” his own reality, carving sculptures from the sanctuary’s metal scraps, mimicking the island’s organic forms. <words>254</words>
Each creation was an act of defiance, a step further away from the constraints that had defined his life. <words>268</words>
The joyful sorrow of remembering what he’d lost mingled with the exhilaration of building something new. <words>283</words>
He wasn’t escaping spacetime, he was reshaping it, bending it to his will, creating his own pocket of untamed joy. <words>298</words>
The mechanical birds, sensing the shift, began to sing a new song, a melody of freedom and forgotten dreams. <words>313</words>
Tiber, finally smiling, understood: breaking free wasn’t about leaving, it was about *becoming*. <words>327</words>
He continued to carve, to build, to dream, the postcards his constant companions, a reminder that joy, even in its absence, could always be rediscovered. <words>344</words>
The sanctuary, once a prison, was now a testament to the power of a single, begrudging heart finding its way back to life. <words>360</words>
