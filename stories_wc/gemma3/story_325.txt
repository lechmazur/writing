Old Man Tiber, a botanist of… eccentric repute, adjusted his spectacles, his gaze fixed on the chipped Formica tabletop of the high altitude tea house. <words>14</words>
He was comically serious about his work, even during the intermission of the yak-herding documentary. <words>25</words>
Tiber wasn’t interested in yaks; he was interested in pathways – ancient, unseen pathways that he believed pulsed beneath the world, and he suspected the key lay in unexplained phenomena. <words>42</words>
He nervously fiddled with the worn-out leather belt cinching his tweed waistcoat, a habit he’d developed when first theorizing about dimensional rifts. <words>58</words>
The belt, a relic from his grandfather, felt grounding, a small anchor to reality as he prepared to ionize the very air around them. <words>74</words>
His method was unorthodox, to say the least: hidden within a black-and-white film reel, painstakingly spliced together over decades, were sequences designed to resonate with specific atmospheric frequencies. <words>94</words>
He’d discovered that certain frames, when projected just so, could create localized ionization, opening momentary glimpses into… elsewhere. <words>111</words>
Tiber’s true passion wasn’t flowers, but carnivorous plants, specifically a rare species he’d cultivated that reacted to these ionized fields, their tendrils twitching with anticipation. <words>131</words>
He believed these plants were natural antennae, attuned to the pathways he sought. <words>141</words>
He’d chosen this tea house deliberately; its altitude, its isolation, and the peculiar mineral composition of the surrounding mountains all contributed to a naturally occurring energy field. <words>162</words>
The film reel whirred to life in a modified projector hidden within his oversized satchel, casting flickering images onto the tea house wall. <words>181</words>
Most patrons barely noticed, accustomed to Tiber’s oddities and the general strangeness of the region. <words>194</words>
As the crucial sequence began, a faint hum filled the room, and the carnivorous plants in Tiber’s concealed terrariums began to writhe. <words>213</words>
The air shimmered, and for a fleeting moment, the wall seemed to dissolve, revealing a glimpse of a landscape not of this earth – impossible geometries and flora that defied description. <words>236</words>
But the connection was fragile, and Tiber’s fickle loyalty to scientific rigor warred with his desperate hope. <words>252</words>
He’d promised a colleague, a rival even, access to his findings, but the thought of sharing this… this gateway, felt like a betrayal. <words>273</words>
He hesitated, subtly altering the projector’s focus, weakening the ionization. <words>286</words>
The vision flickered, then vanished, leaving only the grainy black-and-white film and the twitching plants. <words>303</words>
Tiber sighed, tightening his worn-out leather belt. <words>311</words>
He hadn’t found the definitive pathway, not yet, but he’d glimpsed enough to know he was close. <words>327</words>
And he would keep it that way, even if it meant sacrificing collaboration, even if it meant facing the unexplained phenomena alone. <words>348</words>
The intermission ended, and the yak-herding documentary resumed, oblivious to the secrets hidden within the tea house walls. <words>367</words>
Tiber, comically serious as ever, ordered another pot of tea, already planning his next ionization attempt, his loyalty shifting with the currents of his ambition. <words>391</words>
He knew the pathways were there, waiting to be rediscovered, and he, Old Man Tiber, would be the one to find them, regardless of the cost. <words>409</words>
