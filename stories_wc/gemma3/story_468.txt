Old Man Tiber, a mortician known for being loudly serene even amidst the recently departed, had a peculiar hobby: collecting dream journals. <30> He believed the liminal space between sleep and waking held echoes of lives lived, and the mangrove labyrinth, a place where the night yielded to golden embers, was brimming with them. <53> This wasn’t a typical mangrove swamp; it was inhabited by singing spirits, their melodies woven into the roots and the humid air, and Tiber suspected they gifted dreams to those who listened closely. <83> He navigated the tangled waterways in a flat-bottomed boat, not by sight, but by following footprints that vanished after a single heartbeat – a gift from a grateful spirit decades past. <112>

Today, he sought the journal of Old Man Hemlock, a recluse rumored to dream in colors no living eye had seen. <132> Tiber found Hemlock’s shack, surprisingly neat, and on the floor, a tarnished silver bracelet lay near a half-written entry. <153> The bracelet pulsed with a faint warmth, and Tiber, ever the overly curious mortician, picked it up, immediately feeling a strange compulsion to imitate Hemlock’s last recorded gesture – a slow, deliberate tracing of the bracelet’s design on his own wrist. <186> 

As he did, the air around him shimmered, and the rustle of revelation filled his ears. <197> It wasn’t a sound, exactly, but a feeling of understanding blooming in his chest, a cascade of Hemlock’s memories. <216> He saw Hemlock not as a recluse, but as a guardian, protecting the spirits from those who would exploit their dreams. <237> The journal wasn’t filled with fantastical visions, but with warnings, coded in poetic verse, about a collector who sought to *own* dreams, not understand them. <264>

Tiber realized, with a polite anarchy bubbling within him, that he had been walking a dangerous path. <281> His collection, born of curiosity, could easily become a form of theft. <293> He carefully placed the bracelet back beside the journal, a silent apology to Hemlock’s spirit. <308> He wouldn’t take the journal, but he would heed its warning, shifting his focus from collection to preservation, becoming a listener instead of a hoarder. <333> The footprints reappeared, guiding him back through the labyrinth, the singing spirits seeming to approve of his change of heart. <351> He left the mangrove, the golden embers fading, a little less curious, and a lot more aware. <367> The rustle of revelation had changed him, subtly, profoundly. <376> He understood now that some things are best left to dream. <383>
