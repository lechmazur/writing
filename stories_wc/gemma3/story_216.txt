Elias, a professional scapegoat for hire, adjusted his tie, the shimmering towers of Aethoria – the cloud city – reflecting in its polished surface. <words>14</words>
He’d taken the case of Lord Valerius, a nobleman desperate to shed a past transgression, and Elias was, as always, meticulously calm. <words>26</words>
His current task, however, wasn’t accepting blame, but decoding sacred symbols etched onto a seemingly insignificant metal washer, a relic Valerius claimed held the key to his abandoned identity. <words>42</words>
The timeframe was peculiar: after the last library card got returned to the desk at the Grand Repository, a moment signifying the complete closure of recorded knowledge. <words>59</words>
Elias received instructions only through cryptic phone calls at midnight, the voice on the other end a distorted whisper guiding him toward a forgotten history. <words>76</words>
The washer itself was robustly delicate, its metallic sheen hiding intricate carvings that seemed to shift under the ethereal glow of Aethoria. <words>93</words>
He’d spent weeks in his aerie, a small apartment overlooking the swirling clouds, attempting to understand the symbols, feeling the weight of Valerius’ lost self pressing down on him. <words>113</words>
Each midnight call brought a new fragment, a riddle wrapped in archaic language, pushing Elias further into obsession. <words>128</words>
He began to refashion the washer, not physically, but conceptually, layering interpretations, seeing patterns emerge from the chaos. <words>145</words>
It wasn’t about the symbols themselves, he realized, but the spaces *between* them, the silences that spoke of a deliberate erasure. <words>163</words>
Valerius hadn’t committed a crime, he’d willingly relinquished his name, his lineage, everything, to join a secretive order dedicated to preserving forgotten truths. <words>183</words>
The washer wasn’t a key to reclaiming an identity, but a marker of its voluntary sacrifice. <words>197</words>
Elias, accustomed to bearing the burdens of others, felt a strange kinship with Valerius, a fellow traveler in the realm of lost selves. <words>215</words>
The final call came as the last library card slid into its slot, the sound echoing through the silent city. <words>231</words>
“The washer isn’t for *finding* who you were,” the voice rasped, “but for understanding *why* you left.” <words>248</words>
Elias understood then; his role wasn’t to restore a past, but to validate a choice. <words>262</words>
He looked at the washer, no longer seeing cryptic symbols, but a testament to the power of deliberate forgetting. <words>278</words>
His own profession, he mused, was a similar act of erasure, taking on the identities others wished to discard. <words>294</words>
A quiet satisfaction settled over him, a sense of purpose beyond simply being a scapegoat. <words>308</words>
He was a curator of abandoned lives, a silent witness to the choices that shaped the cloud city’s hidden history. <words>325</words>
The robustly delicate washer felt warm in his hand, a symbol of a truth finally decoded, a life willingly unmade. <words>341</words>
He continued to gaze at the swirling clouds, his obsessive calm unbroken, ready for the next midnight call, the next lost soul. <words>358</words>
The city held countless secrets, and Elias, the professional scapegoat, was there to bear them all. <words>372</words>
