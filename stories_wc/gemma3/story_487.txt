Old Man Tiber, a docile bruiser with hands like weathered oak, traced the faded lines of the map. <words>13</words>
He’d found it shredded beneath the floorboards of the abandoned conservatory, a relic hinting at the greenhouse labyrinth’s true purpose. <words>26</words>
The air thrummed, not with the gentle hum of growing things, but with the relentless pulse of distant drum solos, a rhythm that seemed to coax the man-eating plants into a hungry alertness. <words>42</words>
Tiber, disturbingly calm amidst the verdant threat, wasn’t interested in escape; he was here to *create*. <words>53</words>
He intended to mold a myth from the mud of reality, and the map, he believed, led to the key. <words>66</words>
It detailed the location of a conductor’s baton, rumored to raise the dead, a tool he needed for his grand performance. <words>81</words>
The problem wasn’t the plants, or the drums, but the Gardener – a being of pure botanical will who communicated only in a language of shifting pollen and root pressure, a language Tiber couldn’t understand. <words>103</words>
He’d spent years observing, piecing together the Gardener’s ‘words’ from the plants’ reactions, a frustrating exercise in non-verbal communication. <words>119</words>
Finally, the map aligned with a hidden alcove behind a monstrous Venus flytrap, its jaws snapping in time with the drums. <words>134</words>
There it was: the baton, crafted from polished bone and humming with a faint energy. <words>143</words>
But the Gardener was already there, a towering figure woven from vines and thorns, its ‘voice’ a suffocating cloud of spores. <words>159</words>
Tiber didn’t attempt to explain, to negotiate; words were useless. <words>168</words>
Instead, he raised the baton and, with a deliberate, almost tender motion, began to twist it. <words>181</words>
The drums reached a fever pitch, the plants writhed, and the Gardener…responded. <words>191</words>
Not with aggression, but with a slow, unfolding of leaves, a gesture Tiber had learned meant ‘curiosity’. <words>205</words>
The baton didn’t raise the dead, not in the literal sense. <words>213</words>
It amplified intention, focused will, and Tiber’s intention wasn’t resurrection, but *re-imagining*. <words>227</words>
He twisted the baton again, channeling his vision into the Gardener, showing it, not with words, but with pure feeling, the myth he wanted to birth. <words>245</words>
The Gardener’s form began to shift, to coalesce into something new, something…beautiful. <words>257</words>
The drum solos softened, becoming a supportive rhythm to the unfolding transformation. <words>268</words>
Tiber, still disturbingly calm, watched his creation take root, a testament to the power of brash tenderness and the art of speaking without a voice. <words>287</words>
He had bridged the language barrier, not by understanding the Gardener’s tongue, but by speaking directly to its soul. <words>303</words>
The myth was no longer mud, but a blossoming, terrifying, and wondrous reality. <words>315</words>
The greenhouse labyrinth held its breath, awaiting the dawn of a new legend. <words>326</words>
And Tiber, the docile bruiser, simply smiled. <words>331</words>
He had finally given form to the song within his heart. <words>341</words>
The drums faded to a whisper. <words>347</words>
