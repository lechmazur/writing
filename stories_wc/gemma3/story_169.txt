Old Man Tiber, a soul-broker in real estate – though he preferred “memory curator” – adjusted his spectacles, the floating tea platform beneath him shuddering slightly with the motion. <words>18</words>
He wasn’t selling houses, precisely; he brokered the echoes left within them, the lingering sentiments of past lives, and his office was wherever the currents of discarded things led him. <words>34</words>
Today, that was throughout recycling, a swirling nebula of forgotten possessions. <words>42</words>
Tiber’s method was…unconventional: he’d choreograph persuasive arguments by reading reversed labels on dusty glass bottles, believing the backwards script held the key to unlocking emotional resonance. <words>62</words>
He held a particularly grimy bottle, a dusty wine bottle from a vintage long past, turning it slowly in his hands. <words>75</words>
The label, when flipped and read backwards, spoke of “lost laughter” and “unspoken promises,” a potent cocktail for a grieving homeowner. <words>91</words>
Tiber wasn’t motivated by profit, not really; he sought forgotten songs, melodies woven into the fabric of lives lived, believing each house held a verse. <words>109</words>
He’d discovered that the art of persuasion wasn’t about convincing someone *to* want something, but reminding them of what they’d already lost. <words>127</words>
His own presence was weirdly static, a calming influence amidst the chaotic flow of discarded memories; people rarely remembered *him*, only the feeling he evoked. <words>145</words>
He’d been tasked with convincing Mrs. Gable to release her childhood home, a place brimming with bittersweet memories of her late husband. <words>162</words>
The bottle’s reversed inscription suggested focusing on the freedom of letting go, the possibility of new melodies, rather than dwelling on the silence. <words>181</words>
Tiber approached Mrs. Gable, not with a sales pitch, but with a carefully constructed narrative, a gentle echo of her own unspoken desires, gleaned from the bottle’s backwards wisdom. <words>201</words>
He spoke of the house not as a monument to the past, but as a vessel that had fulfilled its purpose, now ready to release its energy for a new beginning. <words>222</words>
His tone was grandiose modesty, acknowledging the weight of her grief while subtly suggesting the lightness of release. <words>238</words>
It wasn’t manipulation, he insisted to himself, but a delicate re-tuning of perception. <words>250</words>
As Mrs. Gable finally agreed, a faint, almost forgotten tune drifted on the air, a waltz from her wedding day, a song Tiber had unknowingly unearthed. <words>271</words>
He smiled, a small, almost imperceptible movement, and added another verse to his ever-growing collection. <words>284</words>
The tea platform shifted again, drawn by the current to a new pile of discarded treasures, each bottle a potential key to unlocking another lost melody. <words>303</words>
He knew the recycling would continue, and with it, his quiet work of memory curation, a grand, humble pursuit in a world overflowing with forgotten things. <words>323</words>
Another dusty bottle beckoned, its label promising a new story, a new song waiting to be rediscovered. <words>337</words>
Tiber reached for it, ready to begin the delicate choreography of persuasion once more. <words>351</words>
