Old Man Tiber, a scrappy tavern-hand more accustomed to spilled ale than existential dread, polished a chipped mug with a rag, the vacuum chamber garden humming softly around him. <18> The garden wasn’t filled with plants, precisely, but with meticulously arranged dust motes suspended in shimmering, contained nothingness – a peculiar hobby of the late proprietor. <34> He’d inherited the place, and the unsettling quiet, along with a collection of seashells, broken and bleached white, that sat on the counter like forgotten promises. <53> Tiber wasn’t sure *why* he kept them; they felt…important, though he couldn’t articulate how. <65> 

The sands of time flowed backward today, a subtle distortion he’d grown predictably unpredictable to, noticing only when the dust motes began to coalesce instead of dissipate. <84> It meant the calling was strong, the inescapable pull towards…well, he never knew *what* exactly. <96> It just meant he had to *do* something, something utterly random. <104> He’d learned, over decades of these temporal hiccups, that resisting was futile, and usually resulted in a week of bad luck and curdled milk. <125>

Today, the calling led him to the dried-up riverbed outside the garden’s dome, a place usually avoided due to the unsettling stillness. <143> The riverbed was etched with fossilized footprints, not of animals, but of…ideas, he supposed, remnants of thoughts that had once flowed freely. <161> Tiber’s method for randomization was simple: he’d close his eyes, spin around three times, and then step on the first footprint his boot landed in. <181> This time, it was a print shaped like a question mark. <189>

He felt a jolt, a surge of…inspiration? <195> He began to rearrange the broken seashells, not by color or size, but by the emotional resonance each fragment evoked. <214> He wasn’t building anything, not consciously, but a narrative began to unfold, a story of lost voyages and forgotten gods. <233> It was absurd, beautiful, and utterly pointless, yet he couldn’t stop. <245> 

The purpose, he realized with a flippant solemnity, wasn’t to *create* something, but to catapult imagination beyond known realms, to remind himself – and perhaps the universe – that even in a backward-flowing world, stories still mattered. <272> He continued arranging the shells, the dust motes swirling faster, the backward flow intensifying. <286> He didn’t know where this would lead, but for the first time, the inescapable calling felt less like a burden and more like…an invitation. <306> The tavern could wait; the universe, apparently, could not. <314> He added a particularly jagged piece, a shard of pearly white, and smiled, a genuine, rare smile. <328> The garden pulsed with a soft, internal light. <334> It was, undeniably, a good day to be lost. <341> He felt a strange sense of peace, a quiet acceptance of the chaos. <352> The shells seemed to hum with a forgotten energy. <359> And Tiber, the scrappy tavern-hand, kept building. <366>
