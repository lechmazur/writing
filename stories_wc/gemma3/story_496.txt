Old Man Tiber, they called him, though he wasn’t particularly old, just…weathered, like the buildings lining Hemlock Street, an overgrown city street where vines wrestled with brick and wildflowers bloomed in cracked pavement. <30> He was a repressed poet, his verses locked away, deemed too raw, too honest for a world preferring pleasant lies. <48> He carried an antique perfume bottle, not for scent, but as a vessel – a tiny, glass cosmos he hoped to fill with the essence of feeling, to pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin. <76> It was a foolish quest, he knew, fueled by a knowing naivety, but the alternative was silence, and silence was a slow death. <97> He was, secretly terrified, of that silence, of the vast emptiness it represented. <111>

Today, he’d been walking for hours, attempting to distill the city’s decay into something beautiful, something *true*. <129> Then, at the moment a pin might be heard in a silent corridor, he made a spontaneous decision to explore a side road, barely more than a green tunnel. <151> It wasn’t on any map, a forgotten artery of the city’s past. <161> He told himself it was research, a search for inspiration, but really, it was an escape from the lingering doubts that gnawed at his soul. <183> Doubts about his talent, his purpose, his very existence. <192>

The road narrowed, the vegetation thickening until it felt like walking through a cathedral of leaves. <208> Then, the ambush. <210> Not with malice, but with a desperate plea – a young woman, eyes wide with fear, thrust a crumpled note into his hand. <233> “They’re watching,” she whispered, before disappearing back into the green. <244> Tiber, startled, almost dropped the perfume bottle. <252> The note contained a single line of poetry, fragmented and urgent: “The stars remember what we forget.” <269>

He understood, instantly. <272> This wasn’t random; it was a continuation of his own search, a confirmation that others felt the same weight of forgotten truths. <292> The lingering doubts didn’t vanish, but they shifted, becoming a fuel, a challenge. <305> He clutched the perfume bottle tighter, a strange sense of purpose blooming in his chest. <318> Perhaps, he thought, his cosmic verse wasn’t about escaping the darkness, but about illuminating it. <336> He began to walk faster, deeper into the overgrown street, ready to write. <349> The city, reclaimed by nature, felt less like a prison and more like a collaborator. <364> He had a story to tell, and finally, the courage to begin. <370>
