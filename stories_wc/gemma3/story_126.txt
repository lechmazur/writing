Old Man Tiber, a shipwrecked merchant of forgotten Earth-goods, hadn’t smiled in decades. <words>12</words>
He’d arrived on the ‘Elysium’ – the last bastion of humanity – clutching a single, oddly comforting possession: a rustic butter churn, salvaged from his freighter’s hold. <words>28</words>
It was honestly strange, a relic of a pastoral age no one here remembered, a time *before* the last tree fell, before the atmospheric processors choked on dust. <words>46</words>
Tiber wasn’t interested in remembering, though; he was fueled by rebellious sparks, a quiet fury at the manufactured serenity of Elysium. <words>61</words>
The station’s observation deck, a panoramic view of the star-dusted void, was meant to inspire awe, but to Tiber, it was a gilded cage. <words>78</words>
He’d spent years observing the meticulously curated ‘natural’ simulations projected onto the viewport, the fabricated sunsets, the phantom forests. <words>95</words>
They called it ‘preservation through representation,’ but Tiber knew it for what it was: a grand illusion, a denial of their loss. <words>111</words>
His motivation wasn’t nostalgia, but a cold, aloof passion to shatter it. <words>123</words>
He’d discovered a forgotten service tunnel behind the station’s historical archive, leading to a decommissioned transit hub – a ghost station, untouched for generations. <words>142</words>
Within it, a colossal travel poster, advertising holidays on Old Earth, was peeling from the wall, its edges flaking away like ancient skin. <words>161</words>
Tiber had been meticulously studying it for months, realizing the poster’s structural weakness, the way the adhesive had degraded. <words>178</words>
He planned to ascend, not *into* the simulated heavens, but *through* the illusion itself, using the flaking edges of the poster as handholds. <words>197</words>
He began his climb, the butter churn strapped to his back, a ludicrous counterweight to the weight of his purpose. <words>213</words>
Each flake of paper that crumbled in his grip felt like a victory, a tiny fracture in the perfect facade. <words>229</words>
The station’s security systems, dulled by decades of inactivity, barely registered his movement. <words>243</words>
Higher he climbed, past faded images of beaches and mountains, past promises of a world that was gone. <words>259</words>
He reached the top, a tear in the poster revealing the cold, metallic reality of the station’s inner workings. <words>275</words>
With a final, desperate heave, he pulled himself through, emerging onto the observation deck’s control platform. <words>290</words>
He didn’t disable the simulations; he *altered* them. <words>298</words>
He introduced glitches, imperfections, flashes of the desolate truth – the dust storms, the barren landscapes, the skeletal remains of forests. <words>316</words>
Panic erupted amongst the station’s inhabitants as their perfect world fractured. <words>327</words>
Tiber, standing amidst the chaos, finally allowed himself a small, grim smile. <words>339</words>
He hadn’t brought paradise back, but he’d forced them to acknowledge its absence. <words>354</words>
The butter churn, a symbol of a lost world, felt heavier now, a weight of honesty in a sea of lies. <words>371</words>
Let them rebuild, he thought, but let them rebuild with their eyes open, remembering what they had lost, and why. <words>391</words>
The illusion was shattered, and in its place, a fragile, uncomfortable truth began to bloom. <words>405</words>
