Old Man Tiber, a street musician whose repertoire consisted solely of mournful trombone solos, found himself strangely employed at the automated postal sorting facility, a place smelling of dust and deferred dreams. <30> He wasn’t there for the wages, though they were welcome; he was there to *rewind*. <40> It wasn’t a literal rewinding, of course, but a desperate attempt to navigate the backlash of regrets through forgotten patterns in the endless stream of packages. <62> He believed the facility, with its mechanical precision and relentless flow, held echoes of past choices, visible only to someone attuned to the rhythm of loss. <84> 

His tool wasn’t a machine, but a vintage fountain pen, a beautiful, complexly deceptive object he’d salvaged from a discarded suitcase – a suitcase at the close of which lay a life he hadn’t lived. <109> The pen didn’t write forwards, he insisted, but *backwards*, tracing the faint outlines of ‘what ifs’ onto the shipping labels. <128> Each swirl of ink, each carefully chosen word, was a probe into alternate timelines, a desperate search for a punchline to the cosmic joke. <149>

He’d started after his wife, Elara, had passed, realizing his life had been a series of carefully constructed avoidances, a performance of contentment masking a core of quiet desperation. <173> The facility’s sorting algorithms, he discovered, mirrored the branching paths of decision-making, each conveyor belt a potential road not taken. <192> He wasn’t trying to *change* the past, he clarified to the bewildered night shift supervisor, only to understand the humor in its absurdity. <212> 

Tonight, a small, unmarked package caught his eye, its destination a town he’d once dreamed of escaping. <228> He uncapped the fountain pen, the nib scratching against the cardboard, and began to trace a new label, a phantom address leading to a life where he’d followed Elara’s passion for astronomy instead of pursuing a ‘sensible’ career. <254> A wave of joyful despair washed over him; the rewind wasn’t about fixing things, but about acknowledging the beautiful, messy, irrevocably *chosen* path. <276> He smiled, a genuine, aching smile, as the package disappeared into the sorting machine, another echo lost in the mechanical hum. <296> The suitcase might never reopen, but the pen offered a fleeting glimpse inside, a reminder that even in regret, there was a strange, bittersweet grace. <318> He raised his trombone, and a mournful, yet somehow hopeful, melody filled the automated facility. <338>
