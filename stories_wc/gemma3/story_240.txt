Old Man Tiber, a pragmatic soothsayer, lived amongst the twisted branches of Whisperwood, a village gnarled into the very fabric of the ancient forest. <31> He wasn’t known for prophecies of grandeur, but for small comforts – a good harvest, a safe birth, a mended heart – all manufactured, of course. <49> Tiber wasn’t gifted; he *made* miracles, and he did so with a blacksmith’s hammer, surprisingly delicate in his calloused hands. <68> It wasn’t the striking of metal that mattered, but the resonance, the echo of a long-forgotten song he coaxed from the steel. <88> He was, by all accounts, lavishly humble, accepting payment not in coin, but in stories – fragments of lives lived, offered across the hush of memory’s corridors. <113> 

Each story fueled the song, each memory a note in the complex melody that bent reality to his will. <129> He’d begun small, easing aches and pains, but Tiber’s ambition wasn’t comfort; it was to become a force of nature, a whisper in the wind, a root in the earth. <153> He wanted to *be* the miracle, not merely create them. <161> The villagers, initially grateful, grew uneasy as his ‘small comforts’ became… potent. <172> A barren woman bore triplets, a withered tree bloomed in winter, a lost child returned speaking in the tongue of birds. <192> 

The hammer’s song grew louder, more demanding, requiring richer, more desperate tales. <206> Tiber began to seek out sorrow, to *encourage* hardship, subtly nudging lives towards tragedy, all to harvest the potent echoes of grief. <228> Old Man Hemlock, the village elder, noticed the shift, the dreadful hope blooming in Tiber’s eyes. <244> “You’re not easing suffering, Tiber,” Hemlock rasped, “you’re feeding on it.” <257> Tiber merely smiled, the hammer warm in his grip. <264> “All things require fuel, Hemlock. Even gods.” <273> 

He continued to manufacture miracles, each one a step closer to his goal, the forest itself seeming to lean in, listening to the hammer’s song. <296> But the song was changing, becoming less a melody of comfort and more a dirge of ambition, a chilling testament to a man who sought to become something more than human, even if it meant unraveling the world he touched. <334> The echoes of forgotten songs, once a source of healing, now promised only a dreadful, manufactured dawn. <351> He was close, so close, to becoming the force he craved, a terrifying symphony of power forged in the heart of Whisperwood. <371> The hammer rang out, a final, resonant note, lost in the hush of memory. <381>
