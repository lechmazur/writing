<story>
Old Man Tiber, a former lawman haunted by dust and regret, traced the chipped stone of the ancient Japanese castle wall with a calloused thumb. <words>17</words>
He’d sought refuge here, amongst the meticulously raked gravel and silent cherry blossoms, during seed planting season, hoping the rhythm of renewal might quiet the ghosts. <words>32</words>
The corroded rapture of finding peace felt improbable, a fragile bloom in a field of ash, but he clung to it nonetheless. <words>48</words>
He’d come to Japan to escape a cycle of violence he’d perpetuated for too long, trading a badge for a borrowed life. <words>64</words>
A misplaced letter, addressed in elegant calligraphy to a Lord Kenshin, found its way to Tiber’s small, sparsely furnished room – a bureaucratic error, yet somehow…right. <words>83</words>
The letter spoke of a shattered family heirloom, vintage spectacles belonging to Kenshin’s grandfather, a renowned poet, broken during the war and scattered across the castle grounds. <words>103</words>
Tiber, despite his reluctance to engage, felt a pull, a strange resonance with the task of gathering broken pieces. <words>118</words>
He adjusted the spectacles he himself wore, newer, utilitarian, but understanding the weight of lost sight, both literal and metaphorical. <words>135</words>
He began to stir the earth around the newly planted rice paddies, not with a hoe, but with a meticulous search, his eyes scanning for glints of glass and tarnished metal. <words>154</words>
Days blurred into weeks, the castle becoming a labyrinth of fragmented memories and shimmering shards. <words>168</words>
Each piece he found – a lens, a hinge, a sliver of frame – felt like a recovered fragment of his own fractured soul. <words>186</words>
He wasn’t repairing the spectacles for Lord Kenshin, not exactly; he was repairing something within himself. <words>201</words>
The improbable task became a meditation, a way to confront the damage he’d inflicted and the damage he’d endured. <words>217</words>
He discovered the final piece nestled amongst the roots of an ancient maple, a tiny screw holding a world of stories. <words>233</words>
Reassembling the spectacles, Tiber felt a strange sense of completion, a corroded rapture deepening into something akin to hope. <words>251</words>
He delivered them to Lord Kenshin, offering no explanation, only a quiet bow. <words>262</words>
Kenshin, upon seeing the restored spectacles, simply nodded, a knowing glint in his eye. <words>275</words>
“Sometimes,” Kenshin said, his voice soft as falling snow, “the most improbable journeys lead us to the pieces we need to find ourselves.” <words>295</words>
Tiber understood; the letter hadn’t been a mistake, but a summons, a chance to gather not just glass and metal, but the scattered remnants of a life. <words>314</words>
He continued to tend the rice paddies, the cycle of violence receding, replaced by the quiet promise of growth, a former lawman finally finding solace in the act of rebuilding. <words>335</words>
The ancient castle, once a symbol of a distant past, now felt like a sanctuary, a testament to the enduring power of gathering broken pieces and finding improbable peace. <words>356</words>
He stirred the soil one last time, a gentle rhythm echoing the beat of a newly mended heart. <words>369</words>
