Old Man Tiber, a spirited lumberjack more comfortable felling trees than fine dining, felt profoundly out of place amidst the polished bone décor of “The Silent Feast,” an ancient ossuary revamped into a surprisingly gourmet restaurant. <30> He’d taken the job as a groundskeeper, not for the pay, but for proximity to Elara, the chef, rumored to be a keeper of forgotten healing traditions. <51> His motivation stemmed from a recurring nightmare – a battlefield choked with metallic flora, a vision he believed held the key to mending his brother, lost years ago in the logging accidents. <78> 

Each day, Tiber cycled the winding forest paths, the rhythmic whir of the wheels a counterpoint to the fragmented images surfacing in his mind – flashes of chrome and fire, triggered by a coded letter he’d found tucked inside a hollowed-out birch during one of his bike rides. <108> The letter, brittle and smelling of ozone, spoke of a future war and a desperate plea for knowledge lost to time. <128> He was, he suspected, a reluctant courier, the message meant to reach Elara, though why remained a mystery. <148>

Tiber was gracefully awkward in his attempts to learn from Elara, stumbling over herbal names and misidentifying poultices, yet his earnestness disarmed her. <171> He discovered her healing wasn’t solely botanical; she drew power from the very bones surrounding them, channeling the memories of those interred within the ossuary. <194>  She explained the nightmares weren’t random, but echoes of a fractured timeline, reawakened by the letter’s presence. <213> 

He learned Elara wasn’t simply a chef, but a guardian, protecting ancient knowledge from those with hidden agendas – factions from the future seeking to weaponize the past. <238> The letter wasn’t a call for help, but a lure, designed to expose anyone who could decipher it. <257> Tiber’s brother hadn’t died in an accident; he’d been silenced for discovering similar truths. <274> 

Elara began to help Tiber understand how to navigate his nightmares, to sift through the chaos for usable knowledge, to heal not just bodies, but fractured timelines. <297> The revamp of the ossuary wasn’t merely aesthetic; it was a ward, a shield against temporal incursions. <313>  He realized his role wasn’t to prevent the future war, but to prepare for its echoes, to mend the wounds it would inevitably inflict, offering a harsh tenderness to a world on the brink. <336> The bike rides continued, now purposeful journeys into the landscape of his own mind, each pedal stroke a step closer to understanding, and perhaps, to redemption. <356> He was no longer just a lumberjack, but a guardian, bound to a future he never asked for, yet embraced with a quiet, resolute strength. <370>
