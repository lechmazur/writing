Old Man Tiber, an edgy tradesman known for selling salvaged dreams and regret, adjusted his spectacles, the giant mushroom house groaning around him like a tired beast. <words>17</words>
He was, as always, comfortingly pessimistic about the whole endeavor, muttering about wasted time and the inevitable decay of everything. <words>31</words>
In his calloused hand, he held a torn corner of a flyer – a faded advertisement for a ‘Memory Reclamation Service,’ ironically enough. <words>47</words>
The final rotation of the forgotten windmill outside was almost complete, each creak a metronome counting down to… well, he wasn’t entirely sure what. <words>64</words>
He needed to vectorize the fragmented recollections before they dissolved completely, a process he’d perfected over decades of dealing in lost moments. <words>81</words>
His motivation wasn’t profit, not anymore; it was to carry a flickering candle through an endless void, a small defiance against the encroaching nothingness. <words>101</words>
The flyer’s fragment showed only a sliver of a face and the word “Anya,” a name that felt both intimately familiar and utterly alien. <words>118</words>
He glanced at the synchronized watch on his left wrist, then the identical one on his assistant’s, a silent signal to begin. <words>134</words>
“Begin the resonance,” he rasped, and the mushroom house hummed with a low, thrumming energy. <words>147</words>
The process wasn’t about *restoring* memories, Tiber knew; it was about reconstructing distortions, acknowledging the beautiful lies the mind tells itself. <words>168</words>
Anya… the blurry vividness of a sun-drenched field, a shared laugh, a promise whispered on the wind – all fractured, unreliable. <words>187</words>
He focused, letting the watches’ synchronized pulses guide him, mapping the emotional residue onto the fragmented image. <words>204</words>
The memory shifted, warped, revealing not a loving embrace, but a cold dismissal, a betrayal hidden beneath a veneer of affection. <words>223</words>
Tiber didn’t flinch; he’d seen it all before. <words>231</words>
The mind, he understood, wasn’t a recorder, but a sculptor, constantly reshaping the past to fit the present’s anxieties. <words>249</words>
He vectorized the distortion, solidifying the painful truth, not to relive it, but to understand its weight, its influence. <words>267</words>
The windmill groaned its final protest, falling silent as the last rotation ended. <words>279</words>
Another memory salvaged, another lie exposed, another flicker of light held against the void. <words>294</words>
Tiber sighed, a sound lost in the mushroom house’s damp stillness. <words>303</words>
He knew the void would eventually win, but for now, he had his work, his watches, and his comfortingly pessimistic outlook. <words>323</words>
He carefully placed the vectorized memory – a small, obsidian shard – into a velvet-lined box, ready for the next lost soul seeking a distorted truth. <words>343</words>
The candle on his workbench flickered, a fragile beacon in the gathering darkness. <words>356</words>
He adjusted his spectacles once more, already anticipating the next fragment, the next lie, the next inevitable disappointment. <words>370</words>
