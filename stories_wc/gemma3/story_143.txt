Old Man Tiber, a fidgety mage-smith, knelt amongst the lavender, the scent a fragile shield against the encroaching grey. <16> He traced the crumbling brick of the rusted factory ruins, a place he’d haunted for decades, seeking answers in its decay. <29> Above, when only one star remained in a dimming sky, the world felt brittle, poised to unravel. <43> Tiber’s motivation wasn’t glory, or power, but to hold chaos at bay, a task that felt increasingly impossible. <59> He clutched a heavy ring, a collection of keys – each unlocking not doors, but potential, dormant energies within the land. <75> 

He was attempting to remake the ward stones, ancient constructs that once pulsed with life, now silent and cracked. <89> His method wasn’t from any grand tome, but via abandoned chalkboard notes left by the factory’s previous owner, a forgotten alchemist obsessed with botanical resilience. <109> The notes spoke of “seeds of regrowth,” not literal flora, but echoes of creation woven into the very fabric of the world. <125> Tiber, despite his magical aptitude, was musically untalented; he couldn’t weave spells with song like the old mages, relying instead on precise, almost frantic hammering and the careful placement of the keys. <148>

Each key resonated with a different frequency, a different aspect of the land’s lost vitality. <159> He’d found a particularly stubborn stone, its energy choked by the factory’s lingering sorrow. <172> A fearful joy bloomed in his chest as he worked, the lavender trembling around him, responding to the subtle shifts in energy. <189> He hammered a key into a fissure, a high-pitched whine escaping the stone, then quickly another, and another, following the alchemist’s cryptic diagrams. <208> 

The air crackled, and a faint green glow emanated from the stone, spreading like veins across its surface. <223> It wasn’t a perfect restoration, not yet, but a spark, a promise. <232> Tiber knew the ward wouldn’t hold forever, the darkness was too vast, too hungry. <244> But for tonight, under the single, fading star, he’d bought them a little more time, a little more hope. <259> He continued his work, the rhythmic clang of his hammer a defiant heartbeat in the face of oblivion, fueled by the seeds of regrowth and the weight of the keys in his hand. <283> The lavender swayed, a silent chorus to his fearful, hopeful labor. <293> He knew he would remake as many as he could, until his hands could no longer hold the hammer, or the sky swallowed the last star. <309>
