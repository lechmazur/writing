Old Man Tiber, the outcast scholar, hadn’t felt sunlight in decades, preferring the perpetual twilight of Esme’s Emporium – a witch’s flying carpet garage crammed with forgotten enchantments. <17> He’d been drawn there by whispers, rumors of a way to prove his life’s work: that midnight only lasts so long. <31> His obsession stemmed from a childhood trauma, a night that felt endless, a darkness he’d vowed to quantify. <48> He clutched a seashell, cool and smooth, bearing a strange symbol that pulsed faintly against his palm. <63> It was said to mirror the soul, revealing truths hidden even from the holder. <78> 

Tiber’s research led him to a series of diaries, hidden behind a loose tile in the grimy restroom of the Rusty Mug tavern – a decidedly unmagical location. <98> The diaries belonged to a long-dead chronomancer, detailing experiments with temporal distortions. <114> He’d been reading in the hush of a half-lit corridor within the garage, the scent of oiled gears and moth-eaten velvet thick in the air. <133> Esme, the garage’s owner, was strangely trustworthy, despite her reputation for dealing in questionable wares; she simply didn’t care what he sought, only that he paid her rent. <154>

Suddenly, a jolt ran through the floor, shaking dust from the rafters. <164> The seashell flared with an intense blue light, and Tiber felt a dizzying pull, a sensation of being…unmade. <183> The diaries began to glow, their pages flipping wildly, displaying fragmented images of his own life – moments of joy, regret, and the endless night of his childhood. <206> He realized the chronomancer hadn’t been trying to *control* time, but to understand its subjective nature, how perception warped its flow. <227>

The symbol on the seashell wasn’t a key to altering midnight, but a lens for understanding it. <243> The diaries revealed that the chronomancer believed everyone carried their own “midnight” – a period of personal darkness defined by trauma and fear. <266> Tiber understood then: proving midnight’s finite length wasn’t about changing the world, but about changing *himself*. <285> The jolt subsided, leaving a frantic peace in its wake. <294> He looked at the seashell, no longer seeking an answer, but a reflection. <305> He finally understood that the length of midnight wasn’t a universal constant, but a measure of the soul’s own healing. <324> He closed the diary, a small smile gracing his lips. <332> The garage, with its flying carpets and strange aromas, felt a little less lonely. <344> He had found his proof, not in altering time, but in accepting it. <356> The seashell dimmed, its mirroring complete. <364> He was ready to face the dawn. <371>
