Old Man Tiber, a soothsayer whose mild panic was a permanent fixture, squinted at the swirling grain of the bar top. <words>17</words>
He wasn’t looking *at* the wood, precisely, but *through* it, magnifying the water rings left by countless forgotten travelers in this neon-lit desert maze of billboards. <words>32</words>
Between lost years, time felt… viscous, like trying to wade through honey, and the bar was the only stable point in a shifting reality. <words>49</words>
“Another one coming,” he muttered, his voice thick with molten sarcasm, “another soul convinced they can ‘fix’ things.” <words>65</words>
He traced a particularly complex ring with a calloused finger; it spoke of ambition, of a desire to shape destiny with bare hands, and a profound misunderstanding of consequences. <words>85</words>
Tiber clutched the pocket puzzle box with 13 locks, its cool metal a small comfort against the desert heat. <words>99</words>
Each lock represented a choice, a turning point, and he’d been tasked with ensuring the right ones were opened – or, more often, remained stubbornly closed. <words>118</words>
This new arrival, the rings suggested, believed they could ‘improve’ the desert, ‘optimize’ its resources, a probably unlikely scenario given the history of such endeavors. <words>138</words>
“Environmental stewardship,” Tiber scoffed, “the latest delusion.” <words>146</words>
He’d seen empires rise and fall on similar promises, leaving behind only more plastic and regret. <words>159</words>
The rings now showed a focus on water, a desperate attempt to divert the dwindling underground reserves. <words>173</words>
Tiber knew this path; it always led to dust and despair. <words>181</words>
He needed to intervene, to subtly nudge this savior towards a different course, but direct interference rarely worked. <words>194</words>
The puzzle box, with its intricate mechanisms, was his tool – a way to influence events without revealing his hand. <words>209</words>
He began to manipulate the tiny tumblers, each click a silent prayer, a desperate attempt to alter the flow of fate. <words>225</words>
It was a long shot, a probably unlikely success, but Tiber had learned that even the smallest adjustments could ripple through time. <words>242</words>
He magnified his focus, reading deeper into the wood, searching for a weakness, a point of leverage. <words>255</words>
The billboards flickered, casting long, distorted shadows, as if the desert itself held its breath. <words>269</words>
He had to be precise; the fate of this fragile ecosystem, and perhaps more, rested on the turning of thirteen tiny locks. <words>287</words>
Tiber sighed, the weight of lost years pressing down on him, and continued his work, a mildly panicked soothsayer against the encroaching darkness. <words>305</words>
One click, then another, hoping to steer destiny away from the inevitable. <words>316</words>
The water rings shifted, subtly, almost imperceptibly, offering a glimmer of… something. <words>329</words>
Perhaps, just perhaps, this time would be different. <words>338</words>
He continued to work, the puzzle box warm in his hand, a small beacon of hope in the neon wasteland. <words>353</words>
The desert waited, silent and watchful, for the outcome of his unlikely endeavor. <words>366</words>
Tiber knew his task was never truly finished, only postponed. <words>376</words>
