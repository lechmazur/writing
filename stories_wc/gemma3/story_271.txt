Old Man Tiber, the morbid juggler, hadn’t felt a genuine smile directed *at* him in decades, only *with* him, a shared acknowledgement of the absurd. <31> He preferred it that way, a fleeting connection within the span of a shared smile, enough to fuel another performance. <47> His stage wasn’t a circus tent, but an abandoned laboratory, glass beakers and rusted machinery his silent audience, remnants of experiments best left forgotten. <68> The air hung thick with the ghosts of ambition and the surprisingly potent scent of rare spices – cardamom, star anise, and something acrid he’d salvaged from a failed botanical study. <89> He used the scent, subtly, to influence moods, to loosen the grip of sorrow, a peculiar method honed over years of observation. <108> 

Today’s act involved three tarnished silver skulls and a bent ruler, a tool he’d “borrowed” from a long-dead surveyor, its markings warped and useless for any practical purpose. <129> Tiber believed in twisting traditions, not breaking them; the surveyor once measured land, he now measured the distance between despair and amusement. <148> He began to juggle, the skulls arcing through the dusty light, each toss a deliberate defiance of gravity and grief. <165> His movements were consistently strange, a jerky, unsettling grace that hinted at a mind perpetually unraveling and reassembling itself. <185> 

He wasn’t performing *for* anyone, not really. <191> Tiber was performing *against* something – the universe’s cruel joke, the inevitable decay, the cosmic punchline he intended to laugh at last. <213> He needed to be the one holding the joke, not the other way around. <223> As a particularly daring toss brought a skull dangerously close to a complex apparatus of tubes and valves, he used a heavy iron clamp to secure a leaking connection, the metallic screech echoing in the cavernous space. <248> It wasn’t repair, exactly, but a symbolic gesture, a refusal to let things simply fall apart. <263> 

A young woman, a scavenger perhaps, had wandered into the lab, drawn by the unusual aroma. <278> She watched him, her expression initially wary, then softening into something akin to… amusement. <291> A small smile touched her lips, and Tiber, feeling the familiar warmth bloom in his chest, tossed the bent ruler high in the air, catching it with a flourish. <313> It wasn’t about the skulls, or the spices, or even the juggling. <322> It was about offering a moment of defiant compassion in a world determined to be bleak. <337> He had, for a fleeting instant, achieved his goal. <344> The cosmic punchline could wait. <349>
