Old Man Tiber, a whimsical tinkerer with grease permanently etched under his fingernails, lived in Aethelburg, a suspended palace anchored to colossal stalactites dripping with phosphorescent moss. <31> He wasn’t building grand machines, though; Tiber sculpted time, or rather, its effects. <43> His medium wasn’t marble or clay, but the subtle shifts in the cavern’s ecosystem, meticulously documented and presented through a network of pop-up carnival fortune-tellers. <67> Each booth, appearing and disappearing with the cavern’s air currents, offered a “reading” not of futures, but of the past year’s environmental changes – rainfall acidity, fungal bloom patterns, the dwindling song of the glow-worms. <93> 

His most prized tool was a brass thermometer, oddly truthful in its readings, not of temperature, but of the cavern’s overall vitality. <109> It wasn’t calibrated to degrees, but to a scale of “Bloom” to “Wither,” a spectrum reflecting the health of the hanging gardens that sustained Aethelburg. <128> Tiber’s motivation wasn’t scientific glory, but a quiet confrontation with mortality – his own, and that of his home. <146> He understood Aethelburg, like all things, was fading, and he wanted to chronicle its decline, not with lament, but with practical illusion. <166>

He’d begun this work across the moment an artist’s brush first meets canvas, a single, continuous project spanning decades. <183> Each fortune-teller’s pronouncements were carefully crafted, blending factual data with theatrical flair. <196> “The Crystal Caves weep tears of acid! Prepare for a muted bloom!” one might declare, while another warned, “The Glow-Worm Chorus falters! Remember those who have sung before!” <221> 

The citizens of Aethelburg, initially skeptical, had grown to rely on Tiber’s readings, not as prophecies, but as warnings. <241> They adjusted their farming practices, conserved water, and even began cultivating new strains of phosphorescent moss, all based on the fortune-tellers’ oddly truthful assessments. <267> Tiber, observing their efforts, felt a flicker of hope, a small defiance against the inevitable. <283> He knew he couldn’t *stop* the Wither, but perhaps he could slow it, and in doing so, create a lasting record of Aethelburg’s beauty, a testament to a life lived in the shadow of the stalactites. <309> The brass thermometer, reflecting the faint glow of the cavern, remained his constant companion, a silent measure of time’s relentless passage and a reminder that even in decline, there was a strange, enduring beauty. <338> He continued to sculpt, to observe, to chronicle, until the very last bloom faded. <349>
