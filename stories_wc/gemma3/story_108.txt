Old Man Tiber, they called him, though he wasn’t particularly old, just…vexed, a minstrel whose songs tasted of regret and brine, stood at the Falling Star Collection Point, a desolate stretch of obsidian sand where celestial debris gathered. <30> He clutched a confiscated spy gadget pen, its metallic sheen a cold comfort against the rising panic of the crowd, all drawn here by the promise of wishes granted with each falling star. <53> The stars weren’t gifts, not exactly; they were the ‘gifts of the fog,’ remnants of forgotten realities, and tonight, the fog was thick with madness. <76> Tiber, with a strategically spontaneous grin, decided it was time to act, to hush the escalating cries for impossible desires. <97> 

His family had a tradition, a peculiar one: every year, on the eve of the starfall, they watched a grainy, black-and-white film about a clockmaker and a stolen time machine. <124> It wasn’t about the plot, but the rhythm, the predictable unfolding of events that grounded them when the fog rolled in. <142> He began to speak, not in song, but in a recitation of the film’s dialogue, his voice a low, coy malevolence that somehow cut through the hysteria. <167> 

“The gears must align,” he intoned, mimicking the clockmaker, then subtly activated the pen, causing it to radiate a low-frequency pulse. <189> The pulse wasn’t meant to grant wishes, but to subtly alter perceptions, to nudge the crowd towards a shared, calmer reality. <211> It was a technique passed down through generations, a way to manage the chaos the stars brought. <228> He continued, weaving the film’s narrative with observations about the falling stars, framing them not as sources of power, but as echoes of stories already told. <254> 

“Fate isn’t something you *take* from the stars,” he murmured, his voice gaining strength, “it’s something you find *within* the tapestry of fate itself.” <278> The pen’s radiation intensified, and the crowd’s frenzy began to subside, replaced by a quiet awe. <294> Tiber knew the effect wouldn’t last, the fog always returned, but for now, he had bought them a moment of peace, a respite from the madness, all thanks to a stolen pen and a very strange family tradition. <320> He smiled, a truly coy malevolence flickering in his eyes, as another star streaked across the sky. <336> The stars fell, and Tiber, the vexed minstrel, continued to speak, a guardian against the whispers of forgotten realities. <354>
