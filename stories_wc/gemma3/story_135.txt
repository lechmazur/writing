Old Man Tiber, an ambitious brewer known for his frost-petal ales, believed the frozen harbor of Aethelburg held more than just the groaning of ice and the whir of mechanical caravans. <15> He wasn’t interested in trade, though the caravans, relics from after the invention of the wheel, constantly trundled through, their brass bodies gleaming faintly in the perpetual twilight. <32> Tiber’s motivation was far stranger: he sought to document the dying dialects whispered on the wind, languages lost to time and the relentless march of standardization. <53> He carried a plain metal straw, not for drinking, but as a divining rod, claiming it resonated with the echoes of forgotten tongues. <71> 

The harbor folk considered him eccentric, but Tiber was fiercely loyal to his peculiar faith – a belief that every lost word left a bruise on the world, visible only to those who knew where to look. <93> He’d spent decades studying a faded carnival poster salvaged from a wrecked caravan, convinced it held the key. <109> The poster depicted a laughing harlequin, but Tiber wasn’t interested in the image itself. <122> He was focused on the faint bruises – subtle discolorations that shifted with the light – believing they were a coded map to lost paths, routes taken by speakers of vanished languages. <147>

For years, the poster yielded nothing but frustration, until a particularly harsh winter storm revealed a new pattern in the bruising. <166> He began to decipher them, correlating the shades with phonetic sounds, the shapes with grammatical structures. <183> The path led not outwards, towards other settlements, but *down*, into the icy depths beneath the harbor. <198> Many warned him against it, said the ice held only the bones of failed expeditions, but Tiber would withstand any hardship to preserve what was lost. <216> 

He commissioned a submersible caravan, reinforced with his strongest frost-petal alloy, and descended into the black water. <234> The bruises on the poster had predicted a submerged grotto, and there, etched into the ice walls, were the glyphs of the Sylvani, a people who spoke in songs and whose language had vanished centuries ago. <262> Tiber, using his straw to amplify the faint vibrations, began to record their stories, their poems, their very essence, ensuring their voices wouldn’t be silenced by the frozen silence. <287> He knew the work would never truly be finished, that there were always more lost paths to find, more whispers to capture, but for now, he had saved a piece of the world. <308>
