Old Man Tiber, a swordsman worn smooth by decades of battles he barely remembered, sat in the quiet breakroom of the Skyreach Monastery, the chipped ceramic of his tea warming his hands. <18> The monastery, a collection of buildings clinging to a floating rock, felt particularly still after Master Elara’s resignation – a quiet ripple in the otherwise stagnant pond of their lives. <34> Tiber was fiercely apathetic, or so he pretended; he hadn’t truly *felt* anything in years, not since the fall of Oryn. <49> He clutched a plain cloth bag, its contents the only thing anchoring him to a promise he’d almost forgotten he’d made to himself. <66> 

The promise wasn’t grand, no vow to save the world, just a quiet insistence to witness the celestial dance – the meteor showers that occurred every seventy years, said to hold the echoes of lost stars. <86> He’d promised himself he’d see one, truly *see* one, before he let the weariness consume him entirely. <102> Elara, in her parting speech, had spoken of a lack of spark, of the monastery becoming a tomb for forgotten ideals. <118> Tiber hadn’t reacted, hadn’t even blinked, but her words had stirred something brittle within him. <134>

He’d spent years dismissing the meteor showers as fanciful tales, preferring the predictable rhythm of training and the dull ache of his aging muscles. <153> But now, with Elara gone and the silence pressing in, he realized he was drifting, becoming another ghost in a stone shell. <171> The bag held a star chart, painstakingly copied from a crumbling scroll, detailing the predicted path of the upcoming shower. <189> It was a foolish pursuit, he knew, a desperate grasp at something beautiful in a world steeped in grey. <206>

He would overcome his apathy, not for glory or purpose, but for the sheer, stubborn refusal to surrender to the emptiness. <224> Following the meteor showers wasn’t about finding answers, it was about *looking* for them, about acknowledging that even in the vast indifference of the cosmos, a single spark of defiance could still exist. <246> He rose, the tea forgotten, and headed towards the observatory, the plain cloth bag a weight against his side, a symbol of a promise rekindled. <266> The knowing naivety of hope, long dormant, flickered within him, fragile but present. <278> He would watch the stars fall, and maybe, just maybe, remember what it felt like to be alive. <295> The monastery faded behind him, a silent witness to a swordsman’s quiet rebellion. <308>
