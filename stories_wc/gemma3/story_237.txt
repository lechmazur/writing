Old Man Tiber, a psychic genealogist of some renown (though he was proudly humble about it), sat in the brig of the *Stardust Wraith*, a space pirate ship smelling faintly of ozone and regret. <words>18</words>
The last star faded into morning light, painting the viewport a bruised purple as he examined a chipped pair of dice. <words>31</words>
He wasn’t here for piracy, or plunder, but to decipher a lineage, a desperate attempt to hush the alarm bells of heartbreak echoing in a client’s soul. <words>49</words>
His method was…unconventional: he read the echoes of lives left in diaries found on abandoned bullet trains drifting through the galactic rim. <words>67</words>
This particular train, the *Ephemeral Express*, had belonged to Captain Elara Vance, a notorious smuggler whose family history was the puzzle of destiny he was tasked with unraveling. <words>86</words>
The captain’s great-grandmother, it seemed, had foreseen a terrible fate for her descendants, a cycle of loss and betrayal. <words>103</words>
Tiber rolled the dice, the chipped one clicking softly against its partner; each throw wasn’t about chance, but about lengthening the threads of perception, pulling at the tapestry of time. <words>124</words>
He wasn’t predicting the future, but understanding the currents that *created* it, the choices that solidified a path. <words>139</words>
The diaries spoke of a hidden artifact, a ‘Heartstone’ capable of altering familial luck, but also of a guardian, a being of pure entropy. <words>158</words>
“Grave playfulness, isn’t it?” Tiber murmured to the ship’s robotic jailer, a hulking chrome figure that didn’t respond. <words>173</words>
He discovered Elara wasn’t seeking wealth, but the Heartstone, hoping to break the curse, to rewrite her family’s story. <words>190</words>
But the diaries also revealed the entropy guardian wasn’t a protector of fate, but a collector of heartbreak, *feeding* on the sorrow of broken lineages. <words>208</words>
Elara’s attempt to change destiny was, ironically, strengthening the guardian. <words>218</words>
Tiber realized the solution wasn’t to alter the past, but to accept it, to understand the beauty within the sorrow, to transmute the heartbreak into something else. <words>239</words>
He needed to reach Elara, to tell her that fighting destiny only gave it power, that true freedom lay in acknowledging the weight of her ancestors. <words>259</words>
He focused his psychic energy, attempting to project a message, a single, clear thought: “The puzzle isn’t to be solved, but to be *felt*.” <words>278</words>
The robotic jailer whirred, its optical sensors focusing on Tiber, then, unexpectedly, the brig door hissed open. <words>293</words>
Elara stood there, a flicker of understanding in her eyes, the chipped dice clutched in her hand, a silent acknowledgment of the inevitable, and the strangely beautiful weight of her lineage. <words>314</words>
Perhaps, Tiber thought, some heartbreaks simply needed to be held, not hushed. <words>327</words>
The morning light fully bloomed, washing over the *Stardust Wraith*, a fragile peace settling over the ship and its burdened captain. <words>342</words>
He had done what he could, offering not a solution, but a perspective, a way to navigate the currents of destiny with a little more grace. <words>358</words>
