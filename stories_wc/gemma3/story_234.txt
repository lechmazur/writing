Old Man Tiber, a gentle swordsman more accustomed to polishing steel than wielding it, traced the chipped bone of a Tyrannosaurus Rex with a calloused thumb. <words>17</words>
He’d come to the dinosaur skeleton museum at night, when the city breathed its quietest, and the orchard dog finally stopped barking. <words>31</words>
Tiber wasn’t here for paleontology, though the sheer scale of extinction always stirred something within him; he was here for the sundial, half-painted and tucked away in the Mesozoic Hall. <words>49</words>
He was, by reputation, faithfully unfaithful – a man who offered kindness to everyone, but truly belonged to no one, and tonight, that kindness extended to the cosmos. <words>68</words>
His motivation wasn’t grand ambition, but a quiet yearning to cradle the universe in a cupped hand, to understand its delicate balance. <words>86</words>
He carried an empty matchbox, its cardboard worn soft with years of handling, a repository for small wonders and forgotten promises. <words>103</words>
Tiber was a xenophile, not in the sense of seeking alien life, but in his boundless curiosity for *all* life, past, present, and potential. <words>122</words>
The sundial wasn’t merely a time-telling device; it was a key, its coded angles revealing a sequence – a celestial map etched in shadow and light. <words>141</words>
He’d discovered the code decades ago, a legacy from a wandering astronomer who’d understood the dinosaurs weren’t gone, merely…shifted. <words>159</words>
Tiber adjusted the gnomon, the angle shifting, and a faint hum resonated through the hall, vibrating in the hollow bones. <words>176</words>
He was a late bloomer, his abilities surfacing not in youth, but in the quiet autumn of his life, a blossoming of perception others dismissed as eccentricity. <words>196</words>
The museum’s security guard, a young man named Leo, often found Tiber here, muttering to skeletons and fiddling with the sundial. <words>213</words>
Leo didn’t question it; he’d learned to accept the old man’s quirks, recognizing a profound loneliness beneath the brusque affection. <words>232</words>
Tonight, the hum intensified, and a shimmering distortion appeared above the Tyrannosaurus, a fleeting glimpse of a landscape not of this Earth. <words>252</words>
Tiber smiled, a rare and precious thing, and carefully placed the empty matchbox beneath the distortion, as if collecting stardust. <words>271</words>
“Just a little something to remember it by,” he murmured, his voice rough with emotion, a gentle swordsman offering a gift to the infinite. <words>291</words>
He knew he couldn’t *hold* the universe, but perhaps, he could hold a piece of its echo, a fragment of its wonder, within the worn cardboard of a simple matchbox. <words>312</words>
The distortion faded, leaving only the skeletal giant and the quiet hum of the museum, and Tiber, a late bloomer finally in full, radiant bloom. <words>333</words>
Leo, making his rounds, paused at the hall’s entrance, sensing a shift in the air, a subtle peace he couldn’t explain, and continued his patrol. <words>353</words>
Tiber, content, began polishing his sword, the steel gleaming softly in the dim light, ready for a world he now understood a little better. <words>372</words>
