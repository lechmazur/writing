Old Man Tiber, a gloomy orchardist whose apples tasted of regret, hadn’t seen a proper bloom in decades. <words>13</words>
He wasn’t tending fruit anymore, though; he was collecting echoes, specifically lost lullabies, a pursuit born of a grief too vast for tears. <words>28</words>
His current acquisition led him to the Resonance Testing Facility, a place humming with the hush where past meets prophecy, a concrete scar on the otherwise barren landscape. <words>45</words>
Tiber wasn’t here for scientific inquiry, but via black-market transactions, trading rare grafts of his withered apple trees for access to the facility’s spectral archives. <words>65</words>
He needed to *contain* something, a resonance signature too fragile for conventional storage. <words>76</words>
The object he’d bartered for – a sun-bleached desert skull, strangely smooth and cool to the touch – was the key. <words>91</words>
It wasn’t the skull itself, but what it held: a fragmented lullaby sung by a long-dead desert nomad, a song said to soothe fractured timelines. <words>109</words>
The facility’s technicians, pale and wary, ran scans, muttering about anomalous energy readings and the skull’s…peculiarity. <words>127</words>
“It’s… genuinely artificial,” one finally stammered, “the bone structure mimics life, but the resonance is…constructed.” <words>144</words>
Tiber barely registered their confusion; his focus was on the lullaby, a faint, shimmering thread within the skull’s hollows. <words>161</words>
He’d spent years perfecting a method – a series of intricately carved wooden boxes, each tuned to a specific frequency – to hold these stolen songs. <words>181</words>
His craftsman’s pride wasn’t in the beauty of the boxes, but in their ability to *hold* the intangible, to preserve what was fading. <words>197</words>
This skull, however, required a new design, a box woven with desert grasses and lined with the silvered bark of his oldest apple tree. <words>216</words>
He felt a haggard awe as the technicians prepared to transfer the resonance; the lullaby pulsed weakly, a fragile heartbeat in the sterile room. <words>236</words>
The transfer was successful, the skull now inert, the song safely nestled within his new creation. <words>250</words>
Tiber knew he wasn’t saving the world, only collecting fragments, but each lullaby felt like a small victory against the encroaching silence. <words>270</words>
He imagined a future where these songs, contained and preserved, might bloom again, like apples on a long-dead branch. <words>288</words>
He left the facility, the box carefully secured, the desert wind whispering a forgotten melody, a promise of renewal in a desolate land. <words>307</words>
The orchardist walked on, driven by a quiet desperation and the enduring belief in the power of a song, a testament to a craftsman’s pride. <words>326</words>
He knew the lullabies weren’t merely echoes of the past, but seeds of a future yet to be sung, a prophecy waiting to unfold. <words>344</words>
And he, the gloomy orchardist, would continue to collect them, one fragile resonance at a time. <words>358</words>
