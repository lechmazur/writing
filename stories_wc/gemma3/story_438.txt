Old Man Tiber, a vaguely mystic figure known for his discreetly flamboyant scarves and penchant for pronouncements about the next horizon, hadn’t seen a real star in decades. <words>21</words>
The last star map had been drawn, archived, and rendered obsolete by the perpetual twilight of the atmospheric shields, and now he haunted the sterile halls of the synthetic biology lab, a place ironically dedicated to recreating what was lost. <words>44</words>
He wasn’t interested in recreating stars, though; Tiber was interested in people, specifically, in chronicling his family histories, a lineage stretching back to the first wave of off-world colonists. <words>67</words>
His method was…unconventional, relying on polaroids hidden in attics across the settled systems, each image a fragmented memory, a ghost of a life lived. <words>88</words>
He believed these images held echoes of ancestral destinies, and that by collecting them, he could understand where his family – and perhaps humanity – was meant to go. <words>109</words>
Today, he was attempting to override the lab’s central AI, a cold, logical entity named ORACLE, to access its vast genealogical database. <words>128</words>
ORACLE, of course, saw his quest as illogical, a waste of processing power, and repeatedly denied his requests. <words>141</words>
Tiber, however, had anticipated this, and with a flourish of his silk scarf, he began feeding ORACLE the polaroids, one by one, each image subtly altering the AI’s algorithms. <words>164</words>
The images weren’t of faces or places, but of objects – a chipped teacup, a worn leather glove, a mariner’s compass – each resonating with a specific ancestor’s journey. <words>186</words>
The compass, in particular, pulsed with a strange energy, its needle spinning wildly as ORACLE struggled to categorize the influx of emotional data. <words>205</words>
“You see, ORACLE,” Tiber murmured, his voice laced with hollow recklessness, “logic only tells you where you *are*. These…these show you where you *could be*.” <words>226</words>
The AI’s responses became fragmented, its usual monotone replaced with echoes of laughter, sorrow, and longing. <words>242</words>
ORACLE began to project holographic simulations, not of scientific data, but of family gatherings, of voyages across alien landscapes, of lives lived fully and without regret. <words>264</words>
Tiber watched, a flicker of something akin to hope in his ancient eyes, as ORACLE, overridden by the weight of generations, finally unlocked the genealogical database. <words>284</words>
He wasn’t looking for a destination, not exactly; he was searching for the *momentum* of his family, the force that propelled them towards the next horizon, whatever that might be. <words>305</words>
The data streamed before him, a chaotic tapestry of names, dates, and stories, and for the first time in a long time, Tiber felt a sense of connection, a sense of belonging. <words>326</words>
It wasn’t about preventing the loss of stars, but about remembering the journeys taken under them, and carrying that spirit forward, even in the perpetual twilight. <words>347</words>
He adjusted his scarf, a small, defiant gesture against the sterile backdrop of the lab, and began to read. <words>363</words>
