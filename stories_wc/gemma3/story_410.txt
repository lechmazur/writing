Old Man Tiber, an astute hermit more familiar with the whispers of stone than human voices, hadn’t seen a soul in decades. <words>14</words>
He resided within a cavern cathedral, its vaulted ceilings dripping with phosphorescent flora that pulsed with a sickly green light, a beautiful but lonely spectacle. <words>29</words>
His current obsession, bordering on desperation, was restoring the ancient water systems that fed the forgotten levels below – a task he believed was the only thing preventing total societal collapse, though who was left to save, he often wondered with a despairing humor. <words>51</words>
The moment an elevator arrived on the empty, dust-choked 78th floor, Tiber knew something was different; the silence felt… expectant. <words>67</words>
He’d rigged a sensor to alert him to any intrusion, and now, clutching a blunt scissor – his only tool for delicate repairs, strangely effective despite its limitations – he prepared to investigate. <words>86</words>
Tiber didn’t bother with greetings; he’d forgotten how. <words>92</words>
Instead, he began to amplify the scent of a fresh loaf of bread, a skill he’d honed over years of solitude, discovering that certain aromas could subtly influence perception and, occasionally, compel action. <words>113</words>
It wasn’t magic, he insisted to the glowing fungi, just advanced olfactory manipulation. <words>123</words>
The bread’s scent wasn’t meant to lure anyone *to* him, but to subtly nudge them towards the control panel for the water pumps. <words>139</words>
Isolation, he’d learned, didn’t just erode sanity; it warped priorities, making grand gestures feel… pointless. <words>154</words>
He needed someone to *do* something, and direct requests felt… rude, after all this time. <words>165</words>
The elevator doors remained open, revealing only empty space, yet the scent seemed to thicken, swirling around the control panel. <words>181</words>
A faint whirring sound began, then another, and the ancient pumps sputtered to life, coughing up decades of accumulated grime. <words>197</words>
Tiber didn’t celebrate; he simply observed, the blunt scissor still clutched in his hand. <words>207</words>
He hadn’t even seen who, or what, had activated the system. <words>215</words>
Perhaps it didn’t matter. <words>219</words>
The water flowed, a small victory in a world drowning in silence. <words>230</words>
He wondered if the scent of bread was a comfort, or just another form of control, another echo of his long, lonely existence. <words>249</words>
The phosphorescent flora seemed to glow a little brighter, as if acknowledging the restored flow, or perhaps just reacting to the increased humidity. <words>268</words>
Tiber sighed, a sound lost in the cavernous space, and began to knead another loaf, preparing for the next unseen visitor, the next silent plea for help. <words>291</words>
He knew, with a chilling certainty, that the isolation wouldn’t end with functioning water systems; it was a condition, not a problem to be solved. <words>312</words>
And the bread, well, the bread was just a way to make the silence a little less… empty. <words>328</words>
He continued to amplify the scent, a fragrant beacon in the echoing darkness, a testament to a life lived on the periphery of a forgotten world. <words>347</words>
