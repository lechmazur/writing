Dr. Aris Thorne, a hive-mind therapist of…uniformly peculiar talents, adjusted his spectacles, the eve of Agent Lyra’s bold discovery hanging heavy in the night air. <words>18</words>
He wasn’t here for pep talks; Lyra’s mission – infiltrating the Chronos Collective – demanded something far stranger: anchoring the ephemeral in reality. <words>32</words>
“Tell me about the sound of hindsight, Agent,” he said, his voice a dry rasp, offering her a chipped mug of something vaguely floral. <words>47</words>
Lyra, usually a whirlwind of controlled energy, sat slumped, staring at a scuffed phone charger plug she’d been twisting in her hands. <words>62</words>
“It’s…a drain, Doctor,” she finally whispered, “like a slow leak, all the possibilities collapsing into what *was*.” <words>78</words>
Thorne nodded, already initiating the session’s unusual method: a single black candle, its wax destined to form coded shapes on the steel table. <words>95</words>
“The Collective manipulates temporal echoes, Agent; they feed on regret, on ‘what ifs’,” he explained, watching the first drops fall. <words>111</words>
“They weaponize the sound of hindsight.” <words>116</words>
He needed to solidify her resolve, to make her memories – the potential failures, the agonizing choices – tangible, less susceptible to their influence. <words>133</words>
The wax dripped, forming a spiral, then a fractured square, mirroring the fragmented intel Lyra had gathered. <words>148</words>
“They’ll try to show you alternatives, Agent, paths where you failed differently, where the outcome was worse,” Thorne continued, a merry bitterness lacing his tone. <words>168</words>
“Don’t listen. The plug…it represents a connection severed, a choice made.” <words>181</words>
Lyra’s grip tightened on the charger. <words>185</words>
“They’ll offer you perfect solutions, but perfection is a phantom, a siren song designed to drain your will.” <words>201</words>
The candle wax now resembled a distorted keyhole, a symbol of access and confinement. <words>214</words>
“This facility…it’s built on layers of discarded timelines, Agent, echoes of agents who weren’t strong enough to resist.” <words>232</words>
Thorne pointed to the forming shapes. <words>236</words>
“Each drip is a moment solidified, a choice made real. Focus on the weight of *this* reality, not the ghosts of others.” <words>256</words>
He watched as Lyra’s shoulders straightened, her gaze sharpening. <words>262</words>
The sound of hindsight, he knew, wouldn’t disappear, but it could be contained, channeled, even used as a weapon. <words>281</words>
“They believe they control time, Agent,” Thorne said, a faint smile playing on his lips, “but time, ultimately, controls us all.” <words>298</words>
The wax formed a final shape: a single, unbroken line. <words>304</words>
“Go now,” he said, “and remind them of that.” <words>309</words>
Lyra rose, the scuffed plug still in her hand, a small, solid anchor against the swirling currents of time. <words>326</words>
She was ready for her discovery, ready to face the echoes, and ready to silence the sound of hindsight. <words>341</words>
The night air felt colder, charged with anticipation, as she disappeared into the labyrinthine corridors of the training facility. <words>358</words>
Thorne extinguished the candle, the coded shapes now frozen in time, a testament to a battle fought and won, at least for tonight. <words>370</words>
