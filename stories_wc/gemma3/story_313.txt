Old Man Tiber, an unusually normal small-time con artist, surveyed the hydroponic lettuce fields of the Dystopian Farm, a place where sunlight was a forgotten myth. <31> He wasn’t here for produce, though; he was here for ghosts, and the peculiar comfort they offered. <44> Tiber’s latest scheme, selling “emotional resonance amplifiers” (empty tape dispensers, really) to grieving citizens, had soured, leaving him staring into the jaws of defeat, a situation he found… invigorating. <73> He aimed to taunt that defeat, to grin in its face, and the ghosts were his audience. <88>

He’d discovered, quite by accident, that the farm – built on the site of a pre-Collapse settlement – was riddled with apparitions, remnants of lives lost to the Great Withering. <109> And Tiber, with his mild fervor, found he could interrogate them, not for information, but for the sheer audacity of it. <126> He held the empty tape dispenser, its plastic cold against his palm, and focused on the shimmering form of a woman near the nutrient tanks. <144> “Tell me,” he began, his voice surprisingly gentle, “did you regret your choices?” <156>

The woman, a former farmhand named Elara, flickered, her spectral eyes filled with a profound sadness. <171> She spoke of a lost love, a missed opportunity, the slow erosion of hope under the grey sky. <188> Tiber listened, not with sympathy, but with a detached curiosity, occasionally prompting her with questions designed to amplify her remorse. <207> It wasn’t cruelty, exactly; it was… calibration. <214> He needed to understand the weight of regret, the specific texture of failure, to better fuel his own defiant grin. <234> 

He moved on to a young boy, then a grizzled engineer, each interrogation a delicate dance of prodding and observation. <252> The lull of remorse, he realized, wasn’t in the stories themselves, but in the *acknowledgement* of them, the willingness to face the ghosts of what might have been. <274> It was a strange form of comfort, a perverse validation of his own flawed existence. <288> He wasn’t seeking redemption, only resilience. <295> 

Holding the empty tape dispenser tighter, Tiber smiled, a genuine, unsettling expression. <307> He’d lost money, yes, but he’d gained something far more valuable: a renewed appreciation for the art of the con, and the exquisite pleasure of staring down oblivion. <328> The ghosts faded, leaving him alone in the silent farm, ready to scheme again, to taunt defeat once more. <345> He was, after all, unusually normal, and remarkably persistent. <355> The empty tape dispenser felt warm now, a symbol of his peculiar triumph. <366>
