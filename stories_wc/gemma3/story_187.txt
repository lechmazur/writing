Old Man Tiber, a stoic wanderer whose face was mesmerizingly bland, watched as Elara, the last of the coven, wiped the final chalk formula from the slate. <words>18</words>
The air in the witch’s familiar training ground, a clearing choked with gnarled hawthorn and whispering willows, felt suddenly empty. <words>31</words>
He’d arrived precisely at this moment, guided not by maps or stars, but by following a trail of nightmares – the lingering echoes of rituals Elara was determined to erase. <words>49</words>
Tiber’s motivation wasn’t malice, but a brash tenderness for forgotten things; he sought to archive ritual practices, believing even darkness deserved remembrance. <words>67</words>
He carried with him a single object: a floorboard from an abandoned cabin, splintered and smelling faintly of woodsmoke and regret. <words>82</words>
“They’re too dangerous,” Elara said, her voice rough with exhaustion, not noticing him yet. <words>91</words>
Tiber didn’t reply, instead he began to impose a silence upon the clearing, a stillness that wasn’t peaceful, but expectant. <words>106</words>
He laid the floorboard at her feet, and as she finally looked down, a vision bloomed in her mind – a young woman, desperate, performing a binding spell within that very cabin. <words>126</words>
It was a necessary lie, a carefully constructed illusion woven from the wood’s absorbed memories, showing her the spell’s original intent: protection, not control. <words>144</words>
Elara flinched, recognizing the spell, but seeing it twisted by later hands. <words>153</words>
“You…show me what it *was*?” she breathed, her skepticism warring with the undeniable truth of the vision. <words>166</words>
Tiber remained silent, letting the floorboard speak for him. <words>173</words>
He knew the full story – the cabin’s owner, a healer wrongly accused, the spell meant to shield her family, the corruption that followed. <words>191</words>
He’d spent decades collecting such fragments, each one a key to unlocking a more nuanced past. <words>203</words>
“Some things are best left buried,” Elara murmured, but her hand hovered over the slate, a flicker of doubt in her eyes. <words>218</words>
Tiber knew she wouldn’t rewrite the formulas, not exactly. <words>227</words>
But she might, he hoped, add a footnote, a whisper of context, a reminder that even the darkest magic could begin with the purest intentions. <words>247</words>
The floorboard pulsed faintly, a silent testament to the power of stories, and the weight of necessary lies. <words>262</words>
He wasn’t saving the magic, merely preserving its memory, a task he approached with the quiet dedication of a man who understood the long, slow ache of forgetting. <words>283</words>
Elara looked up, a strange, fragile smile touching her lips. <words>292</words>
“Perhaps,” she said, her voice barely a whisper, “perhaps some things deserve to be remembered, even if they are dangerous.” <words>308</words>
Tiber simply nodded, his bland face betraying nothing, as the last vestiges of the nightmare trail faded into the twilight. <words>327</words>
He had done what he came to do, archiving a piece of the past, one splintered floorboard at a time. <words>341</words>
The clearing settled into a quiet stillness, a space between worlds, holding both the erased and the remembered. <words>357</words>
The weight of the past, and the future, rested lightly on the stoic wanderer’s shoulders. <words>369</words>
