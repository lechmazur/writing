Old Man Tiber, a wary explorer of echoes, didn’t seek relics of humanity, not anymore. <words>13</words>
He’d long since cataloged the dust of their ambition, the rust of their wars, and now, after the last human story was written, he simply…meandered. <words>26</words>
He preferred to trace the flicker of fireflies, their bioluminescent trails the only legible script left in this age, especially under the thick fog that perpetually clung to the Neon Cathedral. <words>43</words>
The Cathedral wasn’t built for worship, but for advertisement, a skeletal framework of decaying neon signs that pulsed with phantom energy, a monument to desires long extinguished. <words>63</words>
Tiber was loudly introverted, preferring the company of static and the hum of forgotten machinery to any potential conversation, yet he desperately needed something he’d lost. <words>82</words>
He was searching, not for answers, but to spark an unexpected reunion with his own courage, a quality eroded by centuries of witnessing endings. <words>101</words>
Tonight, the fireflies led him to a crumbling kiosk, and within it, a damaged music CD. <words>114</words>
It wasn’t the music itself that mattered – the player was long gone – but the artwork: a faded image of a single, defiant poppy blooming amidst a field of scorched earth. <words>134</words>
To Tiber, it was an emblem of courage, a tiny, vibrant refusal to surrender to the grey. <words>147</words>
He hadn’t felt a flicker of genuine emotion in decades, but the CD warmed his calloused hands. <words>160</words>
He remembered a time, before the quiet, when he’d led expeditions into the Blasted Lands, driven by a naive belief in discovery. <words>178</words>
Fear had been a constant companion, but he’d faced it down, fueled by a reckless, youthful bravado. <words>191</words>
The poppy on the CD wasn’t a symbol of victory, but of *attempting* to bloom despite everything. <words>206</words>
That resonated with the crooked hope that had begun to stir within him. <words>217</words>
He traced the cracks in the CD’s surface, each imperfection a testament to resilience. <words>230</words>
He wasn’t seeking to rebuild the past, only to remember the feeling of facing the darkness, of choosing to shine, however dimly. <words>248</words>
The fireflies pulsed brighter, as if acknowledging his small awakening. <words>259</words>
He continued his meander, the damaged CD clutched tight, no longer a wary explorer of echoes, but a pilgrim rediscovering the embers of his own forgotten fire. <words>281</words>
The fog seemed less oppressive, the neon less mocking, and for the first time in centuries, Tiber felt a fragile, flickering sense of peace. <words>300</words>
He wasn’t sure where he was going, but he knew, with a certainty that surprised even himself, that he wasn’t wandering aimlessly anymore. <words>318</words>
The poppy, a silent emblem, had reminded him that even in the aftermath of everything, courage could still bloom. <words>336</words>
And that, he realized, was a story worth continuing. <words>348</words>
