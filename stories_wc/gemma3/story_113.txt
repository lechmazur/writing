Old Man Tiber, they called him, though he wasn’t particularly old, just…weathered by the crossing of a year everyone would rather forget. <words>17</words>
He was a hesitant bard, more comfortable humming fractured melodies than actually *performing*, and he stood now in a xenon-lit tunnel, the sickly blue glow reflecting in his perpetually downcast eyes. <words>33</words>
Clutched in his hands was Barnaby, a worn-out dinosaur plush, missing an eye and most of his stuffing – a relic from a childhood he barely remembered, yet felt acutely. <words>51</words>
Tiber wasn’t here for nostalgia, though; he was here to unravel a tapestry woven from sorrow, a collective grief that clung to the city like smog. <words>68</words>
The tunnel housed the Chronarium, a network of dream-hopping machines, jury-rigged contraptions designed to access the fading memories of others. <words>86</words>
His task, improbable as it sounded, was to motivate people to *remember* joy, to reinforce the fragile threads of happiness before time completely unraveled them. <words>105</words>
He was, ironically, shyly loud – his voice a hesitant tremor that somehow boomed within the confined spaces of the dreamscapes. <words>119</words>
“Another one,” grumbled Elara, the Chronarium’s technician, gesturing to a flickering machine. “Old Man Hemlock. Lost his daughter last spring.” <words>137</words>
Tiber nodded, adjusting the helmet. The core concept of their work was the fragility of time; memories weren’t fixed points, but currents easily disrupted. <words>156</words>
He entered Hemlock’s dream, a desolate beach under a perpetual twilight. <words>166</words>
Hemlock sat hunched over, building sandcastles that immediately crumbled. <words>176</words>
Tiber, channeling a booming, yet gentle voice, began to sing a silly song about a dinosaur who learned to fly, Barnaby held aloft like a beacon. <words>195</words>
It wasn’t about the song itself, but the *feeling* – a spark of childlike wonder, a momentary defiance of the encroaching darkness. <words>212</words>
He showed Hemlock, through shared dream-logic, how Barnaby represented enduring love, a small, imperfect thing that still held immense value. <words>231</words>
Slowly, Hemlock began to smile, rebuilding the sandcastle with a newfound lightness. <words>241</words>
Tiber withdrew, exhausted but hopeful. <words>247</words>
Each dream was a battle against entropy, a desperate attempt to mend the fractured timeline. <words>261</words>
He knew he couldn’t save everyone, but even a single rekindled memory felt like a victory against the inevitable. <words>278</words>
The irony wasn’t lost on him: a hesitant bard, armed with a tattered toy, fighting to preserve the past in a future determined to forget. <words>297</words>
Yet, within that irony lay a strange, quiet awe – a recognition of the enduring power of even the smallest joys. <words>313</words>
He adjusted Barnaby’s remaining eye and prepared for the next dream, the xenon lights casting long, dancing shadows. <words>330</words>
The year might be ending, but the stories, and the memories, weren’t over yet. <words>342</words>
He had work to do, a tapestry to mend, one fragile thread at a time. <words>355</words>
And Barnaby, his silent companion, would be there with him, a reminder of what was worth saving. <words>371</words>
