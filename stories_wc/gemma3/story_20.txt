Old Man Tiber, a disappointed archer whose aim had long since deserted him, drove his battered Ford pickup with an anxiously calm demeanor, the dashboard rattling a mournful tune. <words>18</words>
He was documenting the slow dance of celestial bodies – not for their beauty, but as a backdrop to chronicle social movements, a task he approached with passionate disinterest. <words>33</words>
His current subject, the “Dust Bloom” protests against the automated grain harvesters, had led him to this desolate stretch of highway, and an unplanned stop at a roadside attraction: the Inverted Waterfall. <words>53</words>
Water defied gravity here, rising in a shimmering curtain from a hidden reservoir, a geological anomaly that felt, to Tiber, like a physical manifestation of regret. <words>72</words>
He’d heard rumors of Elara, the woman who maintained the waterfall, a recluse said to collect lost things, and Tiber needed to confront her. <words>89</words>
Not about the waterfall, or the protests, but about a tarnished silver comb he’d given her decades ago, a comb he now desperately needed for his archive – not as a memento, but as evidence. <words>111</words>
He found her tending a small garden of bioluminescent fungi, her face etched with the same weary acceptance as the landscape. <words>127</words>
“Elara,” he said, his voice raspy from disuse, “I need the comb.” <words>135</words>
She didn’t look surprised, merely gestured to a cluttered workbench overflowing with forgotten treasures. <words>146</words>
“The bridge of regret is paved with such requests, Tiber,” she said, her voice a low hum. <words>158</words>
“It’s for the archive,” he explained, attempting a tone of detached professionalism, “a record of the era, the objects people left behind.” <words>176</words>
“Left behind, or *taken* from?” Elara’s gaze was sharp, unsettlingly perceptive. <words>186</words>
He flinched, the carefully constructed apathy cracking. <words>192</words>
The comb wasn’t about sentiment; it was about proving a connection, a past involvement with a now-powerful industrialist who funded the harvesters. <words>211</words>
He needed to demonstrate the man’s earlier, more humble origins, a detail crucial to discrediting his current narrative. <words>226</words>
Elara retrieved the comb, its silver dulled with age, and handed it over without a word. <words>237</words>
Tiber barely glanced at it, already calculating how to frame its inclusion in his chronicle, another piece of the puzzle in his passionless pursuit of truth. <words>258</words>
He drove away, the inverted waterfall receding in his rearview mirror, a constant, upward flow mirroring the relentless march of time and the weight of unspoken histories. <words>281</words>
The celestial bodies continued their slow dance, indifferent to the small dramas unfolding below, the bridge of regret stretching endlessly behind him. <words>298</words>
He knew, with a chilling certainty, that even with the comb, the truth remained elusive, a phantom limb aching with the memory of what could have been. <words>318</words>
The archive wouldn’t offer solace, only a meticulously cataloged collection of disappointments. <words>331</words>
He continued driving, the rattling Ford a lonely vessel on a highway built on forgotten promises. <words>344</words>
