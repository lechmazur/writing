Old Man Tiber, a lone trapper of starlight and regret, hadn’t spoken a true word in decades. <words>13</words>
He existed between shifts at the Aetherium, a floating observatory tethered to the bruised purple of a nebula, a place where silence was not emptiness but a silently audible hum of cosmic loneliness. <words>31</words>
Tiber wasn’t charting constellations; he was attempting to recommence a life fractured by a loss he refused to name, a loss that had hollowed him out like a winter tree. <words>49</words>
His only companion was a piece of sea glass, smoothed by eons of some forgotten ocean on a world long swallowed by entropy, a pale green reminder that even destruction could birth beauty. <words>68</words>
He’d found it tucked within the brittle pages of microfilm, salvaged from shady archives on the orbital station of Xylos – records detailing a project to siphon radiance from a black hole of doubt, a theoretical energy source. <words>92</words>
The project, deemed too dangerous and ethically questionable, had been abandoned, its data scattered and suppressed. <words>103</words>
Tiber, however, believed the black hole wasn’t a source of despair, but a reservoir of potential, a place where loss wasn’t an ending, but a transformation. <words>122</words>
He’d spent years decoding the microfilm, the grainy images revealing complex algorithms and forgotten technologies, all aimed at converting negative energy into something… usable. <words>142</words>
The Aetherium’s immense lenses weren’t focused on distant galaxies, but on a carefully calibrated point in the void, a miniature black hole contained within a magnetic field. <words>162</words>
He wasn’t trying to *defeat* his grief, but to refine it, to distill it into a power source that could illuminate not just the observatory, but his own shadowed soul. <words>182</words>
The sea glass warmed in his palm as he adjusted the energy conduits, a faint green glow mirroring the swirling vortex before him. <words>200</words>
He understood now: the upside of loss wasn’t forgetting, but learning to carry the weight, to transmute the darkness into light. <words>218</words>
The observatory shuddered, not from instability, but from a surge of power, a silent symphony of reclaimed energy. <words>235</words>
A flicker of something akin to a smile touched Tiber’s lips, the first in decades, a response not to joy, but to a quiet, gritty acceptance. <words>255</words>
He hadn’t erased the past, he’d repurposed it, and in doing so, had found a strange, whimsical hope blooming in the heart of the void. <words>276</words>
The hum of the observatory deepened, resonating with the silently audible rhythm of his own, slowly mending heart. <words>294</words>
He continued to work, refining the process, knowing the siphoning wouldn’t be perfect, but that even imperfect radiance was better than endless darkness. <words>314</words>
The sea glass pulsed, a tiny beacon of resilience in the vast, indifferent cosmos, a testament to the enduring power of a trapper who dared to find the light within the loss. <words>335</words>
He recommenced breathing, fully, for the first time in a lifetime. <words>344</words>
