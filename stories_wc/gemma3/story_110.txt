Old Man Tiber, they called him, though I knew him as simply “the Clockmaker,” spent his days between chapters of other people’s lives, meticulously coaxing time back into fractured mechanisms within his water clock repair shop. <30> I, however, existed in the spaces *between* those chapters, a hidden assassin who found a peculiar solace in the rhythm of dripping water and ticking gears. <49> My current assignment involved the seemingly innocuous widow, Mrs. Hawthorne, and my method wasn’t poison or blade, but through bleak eulogies – carefully crafted speeches that adored the deceased while subtly revealing their hidden truths. <79> 

It was a darkly humorous profession, fueled by a despairing need to transmute my own pain into a masterpiece of subtle destruction. <97> I’d discovered a talent for unearthing secrets, a skill honed by years spent observing the quiet desperation of others. <113> Tonight, I was preparing the eulogy for Mr. Abernathy, Mrs. Hawthorne’s late husband, a man who’d amassed a fortune through less-than-legal means. <136> 

The Clockmaker, a quietly flamboyant soul with a penchant for velvet waistcoats and overly ornate spectacles, didn’t ask questions. <156> He simply offered strong tea and a space amongst the disassembled timepieces. <168> He seemed to adore the intricate workings of things, the delicate balance between order and chaos, much like myself. <186> I found a moss-covered lantern in the shop’s dusty back room, its glass clouded with age, and used its dim light to illuminate the notes I’d compiled on Abernathy. <209> 

The eulogy was almost complete, a tapestry of veiled accusations and carefully placed truths. <226> I’d mention his “generosity,” hinting at the bribes that greased his path to success, and his “dedication to family,” subtly alluding to a secret mistress. <249> It wouldn’t be a direct accusation, of course, just a gentle nudge towards the uncomfortable realities others preferred to ignore. <268> The Clockmaker polished a tiny gear, the metallic gleam reflecting in his spectacles. <281> “Time reveals all, eventually,” he murmured, without looking up. <291> 

He didn’t know *how* right he was. <296> My work wasn’t about ending lives, but about dismantling legacies, exposing the rot beneath the polished veneer of respectability. <317> It was a twisted form of justice, perhaps, but it was the only way I knew to make sense of the world, to find beauty in the broken pieces. <338> The lantern flickered, casting long shadows across the shop, as I finalized the words that would unravel Mrs. Hawthorne’s carefully constructed world. <358> Another chapter closed, another secret revealed, another masterpiece of despairing humor complete. <370>
