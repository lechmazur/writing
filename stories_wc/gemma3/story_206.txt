Old Man Tiber, a candy sculptor with a vendetta simmering for decades, hadn’t smiled since the Directorate seized his family’s maps. <15> He’d spent the entirety of the rebellion crafting not sweets, but exquisitely detailed, precisely creative effigies of Directorate officials – all made of hardened caramel and filled with bitter almond paste. <34> The forgotten market, once vibrant, now echoed with the ghosts of bartered goods and hushed revolutionary whispers, was his workshop and sanctuary. <52> He wasn’t interested in overthrowing the Directorate for freedom, but for access – access to the naval archives rumored to hold the key to Aethel, the hidden continent his grandfather had dedicated his life to discovering. <77> 

His counterattack wasn’t bombs or bullets, but a subtle unraveling of Commander Varkos, the man who’d ordered his family’s research confiscated. <92> It began with a forgotten locket, found tucked within a shipment of sugar beets – a tarnished silver oval containing a faded portrait of a young woman. <111> Tiber knew Varkos’s weakness: a sister he’d publicly disowned years ago, claiming she’d betrayed their family’s ideals. <131> He began leaving a trail of photographs, painstakingly recreated in sugar glass, throughout the market, each depicting a moment from Varkos’s sister’s life – a childhood birthday, a school play, a stolen moment of joy. <159>

Each photograph was placed where Varkos frequented, accompanied by a single, anonymous caramel rose. <171> It wasn’t malice driving Tiber, but ardent scorn for the Directorate’s suppression of knowledge and a desperate hope that disrupting Varkos would loosen his grip on the archives. <193> The anonymous kindness of the roses, a stark contrast to the bitter candy figures, was a deliberate paradox – a reminder of the humanity Varkos had discarded. <213> 

He watched, hidden amongst the stalls, as Varkos’s composure fractured, his face haunted by the resurfaced memories. <231> The photographs weren’t accusations, but echoes of a past Varkos tried to bury. <243> Tiber believed that even a hardened commander, consumed by power, held a vulnerability connected to forgotten love. <261> A coded message, hidden within the sugar glass of the final photograph, led Varkos not to his sister, but to a hidden compartment in his own office, containing a partial map – a fragment of Aethel. <287> Tiber hadn’t sought revenge, only a key. <293> The rebellion raged on, but for Tiber, the true battle had been won, fueled by a vendetta and guided by the power of a forgotten memory. <316> He finally allowed himself a small, brittle smile, tasting the sweet victory. <326> The scent of sugar and scorn hung heavy in the forgotten market. <334>
