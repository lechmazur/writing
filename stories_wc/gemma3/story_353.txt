Old Man Tiber, the small-town baker, wasn’t known for heroism, but for sourdough and a cynically gentle way of correcting children’s grammar. <31> He’d always felt a peculiar connection to the moon, charting its phases not for tides, but for…other things. <49> When shadows learn to speak, he’d always said, that’s when the real work begins. <63> And the shadows *were* speaking, whispering of the Iron Duke, a tyrant who’d choked the land with order, stifling joy and, more importantly, the wild bloom of possibility. <87> Tiber’s motivation wasn’t glory, but a quiet rage at the Duke’s sterile perfection. <101>

His bakery wasn’t just a bakery; it was a front for an emergency time machine garage, built into the root cellar generations ago by a more adventurous ancestor. <124> The machine wasn’t sleek chrome, but cobbled together from farm equipment and powered by focused moonlight – Tiber tracked moon patterns with obsessive precision, calculating temporal jumps. <146> He wasn’t aiming to *change* the past, but to plant seeds of contagion, tiny disruptions that would unravel the Duke’s rigid control. <164> 

His weapon of choice wasn’t a blaster, but pressed flowers, each petal imbued with a carefully cultivated temporal anomaly. <182> He’d discovered that certain blooms, when exposed to specific lunar alignments, could carry a subtle ‘forgetting’ – not of memory, but of *certainty*. <203> The Duke’s power rested on absolute belief in his own righteousness. <215> Tiber planned to exceed the Duke’s expectations of control by seeding the past with doubt. <228>

He calibrated the machine, a faint hum filling the cellar, the scent of yeast mingling with ozone. <245> His target: the Duke’s childhood, a single, seemingly insignificant moment. <257> He wasn’t going to harm the boy, just leave a bouquet of these altered blossoms on his windowsill. <275> A tiny fracture in the foundation of his future tyranny. <285> The machine shuddered, and Tiber, clutching a bundle of pressed lavender and rosemary, stepped into the swirling light. <304> He knew the risks; altering time, even subtly, was dangerous. <314> But the thought of a world where shadows could speak freely, where a little chaos could bloom, was worth it. <334> He had to exceed the Duke’s control, even if it meant risking everything. <345> The machine whirred, and Tiber vanished, leaving only the lingering scent of bread and rebellion. <364> The seeds were sown, and the waiting began. <373> The shadows, he hoped, would soon have a new story to tell. <384>
