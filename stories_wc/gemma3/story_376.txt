Old Eira, a rogue fortune teller known for her modestly flashy attire of woven silver and raven feathers, settled deeper into the carved whalebone chair within the longhouse. <words>18</words>
The longhouse wasn’t truly ancient, not in the way the sagas claimed, but a reimagining built a century past, during a hush of an overlooked era when Viking aesthetics enjoyed a peculiar resurgence amongst the northern nobility. <words>36</words>
She watched Lord Valerius approach, his boots echoing softly on the polished wood, a bottle of dark cherry wine clutched in his hand – their method of discourse, a shared love for wine tasting masking deeper intentions. <words>56</words>
Eira’s true work wasn’t predicting futures, but archiving emotional patterns, believing every heartbreak and triumph left a residue she could distill and study. <words>74</words>
Before him, on a low table crafted from a single petrified root, sat her most prized possession: an amber inkwell, filled with a viscous liquid that shimmered with captured light. <words>93</words>
Valerius poured two generous measures, handing one to Eira, his gaze lingering on the inkwell. <words>106</words>
“Another troubled heart, my Lord?” she asked, her voice a fierce repose, hinting at both empathy and detached observation. <words>121</words>
He didn’t answer directly, instead describing his sister’s impending, politically motivated marriage, his words carefully chosen, yet laced with a desperate plea for…something. <words>143</words>
Eira listened, occasionally tracing patterns on the table with a long, silver fingernail, letting the silence stretch, understanding the unspoken offer. <words>161</words>
He wasn’t seeking a change in fate, but a preservation of feeling – a way to hold onto the grief, the anger, the love, before it was swallowed by duty. <words>182</words>
She knew what he wanted: a drop of his sister’s strongest emotion, captured in the amber ink, a permanent echo within her archive. <words>201</words>
Eira didn’t offer solutions, only acceptance, and a slow, deliberate zigzag motion with her wine glass, a subtle signal she understood. <words>218</words>
“The past is a heavy burden, my Lord,” she murmured, “but sometimes, a little weight is all we have left.” <words>236</words>
He nodded, relief flickering across his face, and described the precise moment of his sister’s quietest despair. <words>254</words>
As he spoke, Eira uncapped the amber inkwell, the scent of ancient resins filling the air, ready to receive the emotional offering. <words>274</words>
It wasn’t about changing the future, but about acknowledging the weight of the present, and ensuring that even in the face of oblivion, something of it remained. <words>296</words>
The wine warmed her hands, the longhouse held its breath, and Eira, the rogue archivist, prepared to add another layer to her ever-growing collection of human experience. <words>317</words>
The amber glowed, a silent promise of remembrance in the hush of the overlooked era. <words>331</words>
Valerius finished his wine, a fragile peace settling over his features, the unspoken transaction complete. <words>348</words>
