Old Man Tiber, the crypt’s perpetually grumpy caretaker, hadn’t felt a genuine emotion in decades, preferring the company of dust and decay to the living. <words>14</words>
He’d been summoned, not to tend to the dead, but to the witch Morwen’s crystal scrying room, a chamber shimmering with amethyst and the scent of dried lavender, a place he actively despised. <words>31</words>
Morwen, eyes fixed on the star-strewn sky throughout their stargazing session, tasked him with a peculiar duty: quell an uprising, not of ghosts, but of fractured memories threatening to overwhelm the collective unconscious. <words>51</words>
The source, she explained with grandiose subtlety, was contained within an unmarked cardboard tube, surprisingly light for the weight of what it held. <words>68</words>
“Trauma,” Morwen breathed, “multiplies singular moments into monstrous echoes; it needs…re-patterning.” <words>82</words>
Tiber scoffed, but accepted the tube, its plainness a stark contrast to the room’s opulence. <words>93</words>
Morwen had constructed a vast sand mandala on the floor, intricate patterns swirling with cosmic dust, and instructed him to work *through* them. <words>109</words>
He was to *jiggle* the tube, not shake it, not open it, but gently disturb its contents while focusing on the mandala’s shifting symmetries. <words>126</words>
Tiber, skeptical, began, a slight tremor in his hand as he followed her bizarre instructions. <words>137</words>
As he jiggled, the patterns in the sand seemed to respond, colors deepening, lines blurring, then reforming with a strange, internal logic. <words>155</words>
He felt a faint pressure in his own mind, a flicker of…something. <words>163</words>
Images, not his own, flooded his awareness: a child’s lost toy, a whispered betrayal, a moment of unbearable grief, each one echoing, multiplying into a chorus of sorrow. <words>184</words>
He realized Morwen wasn’t trying to destroy the trauma, but to redistribute it, to dilute its power by weaving it into the fabric of the universe. <words>203</words>
The jiggling continued throughout the night, the stars wheeling overhead, the mandala subtly shifting with each movement. <words>218</words>
Tiber, surprisingly, found a strange solace in the task, a connection to the suffering of others that chipped away at his own long-held apathy. <words>238</words>
He understood, with a dawning clarity, that even a grumpy crypt caretaker could be a vessel for healing, a conduit for transforming pain. <words>257</words>
The uprising subsided, not with a bang, but with a quiet settling, a gentle re-alignment of energies. <words>271</words>
By dawn, the mandala was complete, a breathtaking tapestry of light and shadow, and the tube felt…empty. <words>287</words>
Tiber, no longer quite so grumpy, handed the tube back to Morwen, a flicker of something akin to gratitude in his eyes. <words>303</words>
“It seems,” he admitted, his voice raspy with disuse, “that even dust remembers.” <words>315</words>
Morwen smiled, a knowing, ancient expression. “Indeed, Tiber. And sometimes, remembering is the only way to truly let go.” <words>333</words>
The witch continued stargazing, while Tiber, for the first time in decades, felt a lightness in his step as he returned to his crypt, the echoes of trauma fading into the vastness of the cosmos. <words>361</words>
