Old Man Tiber, a zealot assassin renowned for his…unique methods, adjusted the bioluminescent algae woven into his robes as he strolled along the phosphorescent pathways of Xylos, the coral reef city. <30> He was on one of his scheduled “nature walks,” though ‘consolidation’ was a more accurate term for his activities. <43> Today’s target: Councilman Vesper, a man Tiber believed had misinterpreted the Great Narwhal’s Song, the foundational epic of their people. <61> Tiber wasn’t interested in simply eliminating Vesper; he intended to *retell* the Song, from the perspective of Karkinos, the monstrous crab-god villain. <82> 

He clutched a faded carnival prize plush – a miniature, one-eyed pufferfish named Bartholomew – a relic from a surface world he’d briefly visited decades ago. <99> Bartholomew wasn’t a sentimental attachment, but a key component in his method: reversed echoes. <112> Tiber believed that by subtly altering the emotional resonance of significant objects, he could rewrite perceptions, and thus, morality itself. <131> He’d already seeded Xylos with subtly ‘off’ trinkets, each a tiny distortion in the collective consciousness. <147>

“Such a lovely anemone, don’t you think, Bartholomew?” Tiber asked the plush, his voice calculatedly playful, as he passed a particularly vibrant bloom. <166> He wasn’t mad, not exactly; he simply saw the universe as a flawed narrative, desperately in need of editing. <183> Vesper, he knew, frequented this path during his midday contemplation. <192> Tiber planned to ‘gift’ him Bartholomew, subtly imbuing the pufferfish with Karkinos’s loneliness and misunderstood ambition. <209>

The Councilman appeared, radiating self-righteousness. <215> “Tiber,” Vesper greeted, a hint of disapproval in his tone. <223> “Still with your…eccentric hobbies?” <230> Tiber smiled, offering Bartholomew. “A small token, Councilman. A reminder that even monsters have stories.” <248> As Vesper accepted the plush, Tiber initiated the reversed echo, a faint ripple of energy passing between them. <266> He watched, with humorous solemnity, as a flicker of doubt crossed Vesper’s face, a seed of empathy for the villain taking root. <287> The retelling had begun. <292> It wasn’t about destruction, Tiber mused, but about perspective. <302> The true epic wasn’t about good versus evil, but about who got to write the story. <317> And Tiber, with his pufferfish and his echoes, was determined to rewrite it. <333> He continued his walk, already planning the next subtle distortion, the next reversed echo. <349> The coral city pulsed around him, slowly, subtly, shifting. <358> The morality of Xylos was becoming… pliable. <365>
