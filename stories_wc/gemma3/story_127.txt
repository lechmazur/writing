Old Man Tiber, they called him, though he wasn’t particularly old, just…worn, a street performer whose clockwork birds hadn’t sung a new tune in months, creatively blocked by a grief he wouldn’t name. <31>
He sat between calls in the Brass Griffin, a steampunk lounge smelling of oiled gears and regret, nursing a lukewarm synth-ale. <49>
His fingers traced the chipped enamel of the glass, then drifted to the rusted knight’s gauntlet hidden beneath his patched coat – a relic, a burden, and the key to everything. <71>
It wasn’t the gauntlet’s metal he needed, but the memory it held, a memory he desperately needed to remember. <88>
Years ago, he’d sworn an oath to Lord Valerius, an oath broken in a moment of panicked self-preservation, and Valerius had become his sworn adversary. <108>
Tiber hadn’t sought revenge, only…peace, a way to offer amends for a betrayal that haunted his every waking moment. <127>
He’d learned of a specialist, a ‘memory weaver’ who claimed to unlock forgotten moments through tactile sensation, specifically, the texture of a coral reef. <151>
The weaver had explained that the brain often stores emotional memories not as images, but as complex sensory maps, and coral, with its infinite variations, could act as a key. <176>
Tiber closed his eyes, pressing the gauntlet against a small, preserved piece of coral the weaver had given him, its brittle branches digging into his palm. <198>
Slowly, fragmented images surfaced: Valerius, younger, laughing, trusting; the ambush, the impossible choice, the desperate lie. <221>
He remembered the precise inflection in Valerius’s voice when he’d extended his hand in friendship, the weight of the gauntlet as it was presented as a symbol of that trust. <246>
The full weight of his betrayal crashed down, but with it, a clarity he hadn’t felt in years. <262>
He knew what he had to do – not to beg forgiveness, but to offer something Valerius truly needed, something he’d stolen along with his trust. <284>
It wouldn’t be easy, Valerius was a formidable man, but Tiber felt a flicker of hope, a coded desperation fueling his resolve. <301>
He finished his synth-ale, the clockwork birds within him stirring, a single, hesitant chirp escaping their brass cages – a promise of a song renewed, a trust tentatively rebuilt. <328>
The gauntlet felt less like a burden now, and more like a map, guiding him towards a difficult, but necessary, reconciliation. <346>
He rose, ready to face his adversary, finally remembering what truly mattered. <358>
