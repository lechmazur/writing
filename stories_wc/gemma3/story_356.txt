Old Man Tiber, a wry caretaker with a warmly aloof air, meticulously dusted crates of salvaged chronometers in the cargo hold of the *Stardust Wanderer*. <words>18</words>
The ship, a notorious space pirate vessel repurposed for… less disruptive endeavors, smelled of ozone and regret. <words>28</words>
He preferred the scent of regret; it was quieter than ambition. <words>36</words>
A chipped, yellow piece of chalk lay in his pocket, a relic from a life he rarely spoke of, a life measured in epochs, not years. <words>49</words>
The ship’s comms crackled, then died with the drawn-out whine of an outdated phone’s dial tone cutting out – a sound that always unsettled him. <words>64</words>
It wasn’t the silence itself, but the echo of possibilities the connection *held*, the endless “what if” siren song he’d spent centuries trying to hush. <words>82</words>
He’d learned, across countless iterations of existence, that time wasn’t a river, but a vast, shimmering ocean, and every choice created a ripple, a phantom current pulling at the soul. <words>102</words>
Tiber began to sketch on the metal floor with the chalk, not images, but lines mirroring the swirling cloud patterns visible through a porthole. <words>118</words>
He wasn’t charting a course, but tracing the pathways *through* time, the subtle eddies where moments overlapped and diverged. <words>134</words>
“They say chasing ghosts is madness,” he murmured, his voice raspy with age and a gentle harshness, “but ghosts are just echoes of choices not made.” <words>153</words>
The chalk dust swirled, illuminated by the emergency lighting, forming a complex web that seemed to pulse with a faint, internal light. <words>169</words>
He focused on a particularly intricate confluence of lines, a nexus point where the present blurred with potential futures. <words>185</words>
It was a method he’d perfected over millennia – to vanish, not into nothingness, but into the spaces *between* moments, to sidestep the weight of consequence. <words>204</words>
He wasn’t escaping time, but dissolving into its fabric, becoming a part of the infinite possibilities he sought to quiet. <words>221</words>
The lines on the floor glowed brighter, the cloud patterns outside mirroring their intensity. <words>232</words>
A faint shimmer enveloped Tiber, his form becoming indistinct, like a heat haze on a distant planet. <words>246</words>
He glanced back at the chronometers, their ticking a mocking reminder of the linear time he was leaving behind. <words>261</words>
“Perhaps,” he whispered, a final, wry smile touching his lips, “a little silence is all anyone truly needs.” <words>277</words>
Then, following the intricate paths he’d drawn with chalk, tracking the ephemeral dance of the clouds, Old Man Tiber simply…vanished. <words>295</words>
The cargo hold remained, filled with the scent of ozone, regret, and the lingering ghost of chalk dust, a testament to the caretaker who understood the nature of time all too well. <words>316</words>
The chronometers continued to tick, oblivious to the absence, measuring a time that Tiber no longer needed to acknowledge. <words>333</words>
The silence was profound, finally, utterly complete. <words>341</words>
