Old Man Tiber, a minstrel whose voice held the dust of forgotten roads, arrived at the Glowcap crossroads as the last spore-lights flickered. <words>17</words>
It was the night the Telling ended – the annual recitation of the Great Root’s history, a tradition the mushroom folk deemed complete, needing no further embellishment. <words>32</words>
Tiber, however, craved what lay *beyond* the Telling, forbidden knowledge whispered to exist in the shadowed mycelial networks. <words>48</words>
He carried only an empty birdcage, its brass bars tarnished, a peculiar companion for a wanderer in a village built of fungi. <words>64</words>
Each night, he’d sit before the chipped paint of the “Welcome to Bloomhaven” sign, its colors fading like a forgotten dream, and begin to explain. <words>82</words>
He didn’t explain *to* anyone, not directly; he explained the sign, comparing each flaking layer to the crumbling illusions the mushroom folk held dear. <words>101</words>
“See how the blue pretends to be sky?” he’d murmur, his voice a feral elegance, “but beneath, it’s just pigment, a lie given form.” <words>119</words>
His explanations were innocently mischievous, not accusatory, but subtly corrosive, aimed at the heart of their unquestioning faith. <words>136</words>
The birdcage, he claimed, was for capturing lost beliefs – the ones that flew away when truth was revealed. <words>151</words>
Old Man Hemlock, the village elder, watched Tiber with growing unease, recognizing the minstrel’s intent. <words>165</words>
“You seek to unravel what has kept us safe for centuries,” Hemlock rasped, his cap trembling. <words>179</words>
Tiber merely smiled, pointing to a newly chipped section of the sign. <words>188</words>
“The red used to be a vibrant poppy, symbolizing life,” he said, “now it’s merely rust, a reminder of decay.” <words>206</words>
He wasn’t trying to destroy their world, but to show them it wasn’t as solid as they believed, that growth required acknowledging the rot. <words>225</words>
The villagers, drawn by his nightly observations, began to question the Telling, to see the gaps in the narrative, the convenient omissions. <words>243</words>
Tiber wasn’t offering new truths, but the tools to dismantle old ones, filling the empty birdcage with the ghosts of discarded certainties. <words>262</words>
Hemlock realized Tiber hadn’t come to steal their faith, but to force them to *earn* it, to build a new understanding on the ruins of the old. <words>281</words>
As the final spore-light died, Tiber packed his cage, the weight of liberated illusions surprisingly light, ready to move on to the next crossroads. <words>299</words>
He left Bloomhaven not with forbidden knowledge *acquired*, but with the quiet satisfaction of having sparked a necessary unraveling. <words>316</words>
The chipped sign, a testament to crumbling illusions, remained, a silent invitation to question everything. <words>331</words>
The end of the Telling wasn’t an ending at all, but a fragile, uncertain beginning. <words>343</words>
Tiber, the innocently mischievous minstrel, continued his journey, leaving behind a village poised on the precipice of a new dawn. <words>361</words>
The empty birdcage swung gently, a symbol of the freedom found in letting go. <words>374</words>
