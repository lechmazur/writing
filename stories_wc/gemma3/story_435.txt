Old Man Tiber, a professional dream interpreter, traced the condensation on the viewport of the vapor collection facility, the metallic tang of reclaimed memories thick in the air. <16> He’d received the crumpled invitation weeks ago, addressed in a looping script he vaguely recognized from a recurring nightmare – a summons to a gathering he knew he shouldn’t attend, yet felt compelled to understand. <36> The facility, normally a sterile hum of machinery, felt different today, a quiet pulse thrumming beneath the floor, mirroring the anxious flutter in his chest. <53> It was during baking, specifically the precise hour his grandmother used to start her rye bread, that the visions were strongest, and the invitation’s pull most insistent. <74> 

Tiber’s motivation wasn’t curiosity, but a peculiar faith – a belief that dreams weren’t glimpses *of* reality, but blueprints for *rewriting* it, specifically the archaic laws carved in stone that governed the flow of time. <98> He’d learned to influence these laws, subtly at first, then with increasing boldness, but always through indirect means. <116> His current method involved impersonating Elias Thorne, a renowned chronologist who’d vanished six months prior, a disappearance conveniently shrouded in rumor and speculation. <138> 

He adjusted the Thorne-mask, a marvel of bio-mimicry, and walked deeper into the facility, occasionally frequenting the observation decks to monitor the vapor streams – each one a fragmented life, a lost moment. <163> The invitation led him to a hidden chamber, where figures cloaked in shadow awaited, their faces obscured by the swirling mist. <181> They spoke of “stabilization,” of preventing temporal fractures, but Tiber sensed a darker purpose, a desire to *calcify* the present, to halt the very change he sought to instigate. <204>

“Elias,” a voice rasped, “we’ve been expecting you.” <211> Tiber, as Thorne, offered a carefully crafted response, subtly planting suggestions, weaving threads of possibility into their rigid ideology. <231> He spoke of the natural ebb and flow of time, of the necessity of disruption for growth, all while subtly manipulating the vapor streams, altering the collective unconscious. <253> The quiet pulse within the facility intensified, responding to his efforts, the air growing heavy with potential. <270> He knew this was a dangerous game, that failure meant not just his capture, but the entrenchment of a stagnant future. <291> But the scent of rye bread, a phantom aroma from his grandmother’s kitchen, spurred him on, a reminder of the warmth he hoped to restore to a world growing cold. <316> He would rewrite the laws, one dream, one impersonation, one carefully placed suggestion at a time. <334> The facility hummed, a silent accomplice to his peculiar faith. <344> The vapor continued to collect, carrying the weight of forgotten moments and the promise of a malleable future. <362>
