Old Man Tian, a calm assassin renowned more for his tea selection than his kill count, adjusted the silk cushions in the abandoned West Wing of the ancient Chinese palace. <words>17</words>
Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight, illuminating his peculiar task: to amalgamate prophecies, not with ink and scrolls, but with pressed flowers. <words>31</words>
He wasn’t creating art, precisely, though the arrangements were… pleasing; he was attempting to spin a prophecy into raw possibility, a feat requiring a delicate touch and a frankly absurd amount of patience. <words>51</words>
His tool wasn’t a dagger, but a botanical press, a heavy iron beast he’d ‘borrowed’ from the Emperor’s neglected gardens. <words>67</words>
The whispers of longing that clung to the palace walls – echoes of forgotten emperors and unfulfilled desires – were, he believed, the key ingredient. <words>84</words>
Tian wasn’t a mystic, not in the traditional sense; he was, as his late mentor had put it, “figuratively literal,” meaning he took everything, *everything*, at face value, even the most poetic pronouncements. <words>106</words>
The current prophecy spoke of a “shadowed bloom” and a “winged messenger,” vague enough to be useless, but Tian saw potential. <words>121</words>
He carefully positioned a pressed moonflower – the shadowed bloom – alongside a vibrant swallowtail butterfly, its wings meticulously flattened within the press. <words>139</words>
He worked by the pattern of a butterfly's wings, believing the fractal geometry held the universe’s secrets, or at least a decent approximation of them. <words>158</words>
It was, he admitted to the empty room, a ridiculous notion, but then again, so was being a highly-paid assassin who preferred chamomile to carnage. <words>177</words>
The palace was eerily silent, this happening before the first question was asked of the new Emperor, a blank slate upon which Tian was attempting to write a favorable future. <words>198</words>
He wasn’t preventing a disaster, not exactly; he was nudging fate, subtly altering the probabilities. <words>211</words>
A slight tremor ran through the palace, not of an earthquake, but of… anticipation. <words>223</words>
Tian chuckled, a dry, rustling sound. <words>228</words>
“Honestly,” he murmured, arranging a sprig of jasmine, “the drama of it all.” <words>241</words>
He felt a humorous unease, a prickling sensation that suggested he was either on the verge of a breakthrough or had completely lost his mind. <words>258</words>
The completed arrangement, viewed through the glass of the press, pulsed with a strange, floral energy. <words>272</words>
It wasn’t beautiful, not in the conventional sense, but it *felt* right, a chaotic harmony of petals and wings. <words>287</words>
He released the press, the flowers now permanently bound, a fragile testament to his peculiar craft. <words>301</words>
The prophecy, he hoped, was now less a prediction and more a suggestion, a gentle push towards a more… agreeable outcome. <words>317</words>
He brewed another cup of tea, the scent of bergamot filling the silent wing, and waited for the questions to begin. <words>333</words>
Perhaps, just perhaps, he’d managed to convince fate to take a slightly different path, all thanks to a few pressed flowers and a very strange belief in butterflies. <words>353</words>
The palace held its breath. <words>358</words>
