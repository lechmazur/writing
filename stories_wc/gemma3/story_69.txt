Old Man Tiber, they called him, though he wasn’t particularly old, just…weathered, an uncertain druid more comfortable with root systems than people. <words>14</words>
He wandered, not with purpose, but with the lethargic excitement of someone expecting something interesting to eventually bloom from the concrete. <words>27</words>
His method was peculiar: attending back-alley theater auditions, not to act, but to listen, to absorb the raw, desperate energy of hopefuls. <words>43</words>
It was during library hours, a timeframe he adhered to religiously, that he’d usually find himself at “Static & Bloom,” a hologram repair shop smelling of ozone and regret. <words>62</words>
The shop’s owner, a woman named Lyra, tolerated him, mostly because he paid in uniquely common wildflowers, pressed flat and smelling faintly of the forest. <words>81</words>
Today, he carried a dented lunch tin, not for food, but as a resonator, hoping to amplify the emotional static of the auditions he’d just left. <words>99</words>
He believed beauty could be forged from anarchy, that the fractured narratives of failed actors held a strange, potent magic. <words>116</words>
Lyra was attempting to restore a holographic hummingbird, its wings flickering erratically. <words>128</words>
“Another batch of broken dreams, Tiber?” she asked, not looking up. <words>138</words>
He nodded, placing the tin on the counter. “The ties of obligation are strong, even to illusions.” <words>154</words>
He explained, with a sigh, how each audition was a small debt owed to a hope, a performance given not for applause, but for the *chance* of applause. <words>174</words>
Lyra paused, her fingers hovering over a circuit board. “You think their disappointment…powers this?” she gestured to the tin. <words>190</words>
“Not powers, exactly,” Tiber mumbled, “but…informs it. Gives it texture. The world is full of unfinished symphonies.” <words>208</words>
He believed the tin, acting as a conduit, could help Lyra stabilize the hummingbird’s hologram, grounding its frantic energy. <words>226</words>
It wasn’t about fixing the broken, but about acknowledging the break, the inherent fragility of things. <words>241</words>
Lyra, surprisingly, placed the tin near the projector. <words>249</words>
The hummingbird’s wings steadied, the flickering resolving into a graceful, shimmering flight. <words>263</words>
“Huh,” Lyra said, a flicker of something akin to wonder in her eyes. <words>272</words>
Tiber offered a small, tired smile. “Sometimes, all a ghost needs is a little recognition.” <words>287</words>
He accepted a single, perfect bluebell from Lyra in exchange, a small payment for a service rendered, a tie of obligation fulfilled. <words>304</words>
He wandered back into the library’s quiet hum, already anticipating the next wave of hopefuls and their beautifully broken stories. <words>322</words>
The dented lunch tin felt warm in his hand, a vessel for the echoes of dreams. <words>336</words>
He knew, with a certainty that surprised even himself, that the anarchy would continue to bloom. <words>351</words>
And he would be there, listening, collecting, and quietly forging beauty from the fragments. <words>368</words>
The library doors closed, and Tiber continued his wander. <words>377</words>
