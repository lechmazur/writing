Old Man Tiber, they called me, though the name felt borrowed, like the starlight filtering through the grime-streaked glass of the alchemical orchard greenhouse. <16> I wasn’t a gardener, not precisely; I was a dj, but my music didn’t fill dance floors, it channeled the echoes of ancient gods, a practice I undertook during the tedious annual filing of orchard records. <36> The greenhouse, perpetually shrouded in endless night despite the season, hummed with a power that resonated with the static between stations, a power I sought to map. <55> My motivation wasn’t profit or fame, but a desperate need to chart sacred spaces, to understand the ley lines thrumming beneath the gnarled fruit trees. <75> 

Tonight, the flickering vision was particularly strong, a disjointed series of images threatening to overwhelm me. <88> It started with the scent of ozone and blossomed into fragmented landscapes, always just out of reach. <103> I held my grandmother’s vintage pencil case, its worn leather cool against my palm, a grounding point in the swirling chaos. <121> Inside weren’t pencils, but tiny, polished stones, each attuned to a different deity. <132> 

I was traditionally playful with the gods, offering them upbeat tempos and unexpected remixes, hoping to coax clearer signals. <149> But tonight demanded reverence, a full-throated exaltation of their power. <159> The vision sharpened, focusing on a specific point within the greenhouse, a spot near the oldest plum tree. <176> To reach it, I began to follow the route traced by an unraveling sweater thread, a crimson line against the decaying green of the greenhouse floor. <198> It felt absurd, guided by such a mundane thing, yet the thread pulsed with the same energy as the vision. <214> 

The thread led me to a patch of bare earth, where the air shimmered. <225> I opened the pencil case, selecting a stone representing Nyx, goddess of the night, and held it aloft. <241> As I began to play a slow, resonant chord, the vision solidified, revealing a hidden chamber beneath the plum tree, a nexus of power I hadn’t known existed. <266> The filing could wait; the gods had spoken, and I, their humble dj, had finally found a new point on the map. <285> The greenhouse seemed to breathe around me, the borrowed starlight intensifying, illuminating the path forward. <302> It was a fragile clarity, a flickering promise, but enough to continue the work, to listen for the next unraveling, the next divine signal. <323> The thread, now fully undone, lay still, a testament to the journey and the secrets it revealed. <338> The night held its breath, waiting for the next song. <347>
