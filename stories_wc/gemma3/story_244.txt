The chipped neon of “Rosie’s Repairs” flickered, casting a sickly green glow on Elara’s face as she entered, the scent of ozone and dust thick in the air. <31> She was a swordswoman, though guilt had long since dulled the edge of her skill, and she moved with a reservedly bold grace, seeking not a fight, but information. <51> Old Man Tiber, hunched over a tangle of wires, barely glanced up. <61> It was after the final petal drops from the old rosebush – a yearly marker for Elara, signifying the anniversary of her… transgression, and the start of her pursuit. <84> 

She needed to find the Door of Release, a legend whispered about in hushed tones, a gateway to something beyond consequence. <98> Tiber, she’d learned, gleaned secrets from half-truth historians, men who traded in fragmented lore for cheap liquor and forgotten memories. <121> “I’m looking for stories about thresholds, Tiber,” she said, her voice low, placing a handful of credits on his workbench. <139> “Places where one world ends and another begins.” <151>

He grunted, accepting the payment. <155> “Heard tell of a mask,” he rasped, finally meeting her gaze. <166> “Tribal, they say, with labyrinthine carvings that shift with the moonlight. <179> Supposedly, it points the way.” <188> Elara’s hand instinctively went to the hilt of the sword at her side, a phantom weight of past battles. <206> The mask wasn’t a weapon, but a key, and she knew, with a chilling certainty, that finding it was the only way to quiet the voices. <226>

Tiber described a collector, a recluse named Silas, who lived amongst the ruins of Old Veridia. <241> Silas, Tiber warned, traded only in burdens – memories, regrets, the weight of unspoken truths. <258> Elara offered him a single, polished obsidian stone, a memento of a life she no longer recognized. <272> “Silas will want to know *why* you seek the Door,” Tiber cautioned. <282> 

“Tell him,” Elara said, her voice barely a whisper, “that I’m ready to pay the price for forgetting.” <297> She left Rosie’s Repairs, the neon glow fading behind her, and stepped into the rain-slicked streets, the image of the mask – and the promise of release – burning in her mind. <324> The pursuit had begun anew, fueled by a desperate hope and a lifetime of regret. <337> She would find the Door, even if it meant facing the darkness within herself. <352> The unknown awaited, and she, the guilty swordswoman, was finally ready to meet it. <368>
