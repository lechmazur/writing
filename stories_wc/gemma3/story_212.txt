Old Man Tiber, an apocalyptic farmer, hadn’t spoken a clear sentence in decades, preferring to jabber at the wind, a habit born of solitude and the dust of the last resource war. <31>
He wasn’t like the others, typically atypical in a world demanding conformity for survival, stubbornly breeding new seeds on the ethereal plains where the soil remembered rain. <53>
These weren’t fields of plenty, but experiments in resilience, each sprout a tiny rebellion against the grey that had consumed everything else. <73>
His only companion was a weathered magician’s deck of trick cards, found amongst the wreckage of a coastal city, their vibrant colours a painful echo of a lost world. <96>
He didn’t perform tricks, but laid the cards out each night, believing the patterns held whispers of what the land needed, a strange, intuitive agriculture. <119>
Tiber wasn’t seeking abundance, only escape – escape from the Council’s dictates, from their genetically modified crops and controlled lives, from a future not of his choosing. <146>
He’d once been a bioengineer *for* the Council, designing the very seeds that now choked the life out of independent farms, a guilt he carried like stones in his pockets. <174>
Now, he sent his defiance out to sea, not in weapons or manifestos, but through the messages in a bottle, each containing a single, carefully cultivated seed and a card from the deck. <202>
The cards weren’t random; he chose them based on the seed’s properties, believing they amplified the message, a silent plea for autonomy carried on the currents. <226>
He called it “the song of boundaries,” the inherent right of every living thing to define its own space, its own growth, its own destiny. <248>
The sea, he felt, understood this song, carrying it to distant shores, to others who might still remember what it meant to be free. <269>
Sometimes, a bottle would wash back ashore, empty, a silent acknowledgement, or occasionally, a small stone placed inside, a sign of reception. <291>
It wasn’t much, but it was enough to fuel his raw solace, the quiet dignity of a man refusing to let the world dictate his final harvest. <313>
He continued to jabber, to plant, to send his messages, a lone voice singing the song of boundaries across the ethereal plains, hoping someone, somewhere, was listening. <336>
The cards, the seeds, the sea – his atypical rebellion, a testament to the enduring power of hope in a world stripped bare. <354>
