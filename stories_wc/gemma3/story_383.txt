General Silas, a man whose victories felt like defeats these days, stirred his lukewarm coffee in the Dark Matter Diner, a greasy spoon perpetually stuck “between rides” on some cosmic carousel. <words>18</words>
He’d seen enough war to know fear wasn’t the opposite of courage, but its fuel, and he was thoroughly burnt-out on both. <words>31</words>
Across the chipped Formica table, Old Man Tiber, the diner’s proprietor, slid a small, brittle pile of dried seaweed towards him. <words>45</words>
“For the anxieties, General,” Tiber rasped, his voice like static. “They cling, don’t they? Like salt to the tide.” <words>61</words>
Silas picked up a strand, its texture strangely comforting; it was rationally absurd to find solace in desiccated ocean plants, yet here he was. <words>78</words>
Tiber had a method, a peculiar one: he helped people renew themselves via arcs in black-and-white photographs, capturing moments of quiet desperation and subtle hope. <words>97</words>
“You want to dethrone fear from the throne of reason, eh?” Tiber asked, already fiddling with an ancient Polaroid camera. <words>113</words>
Silas nodded, the weight of countless decisions pressing down on him. He wasn’t afraid of dying, but of the pointless continuation of suffering. <words>131</words>
“Everyone carries a shared anxiety, General,” Tiber continued, snapping a photo of Silas holding the seaweed. “The fear of being forgotten, of meaninglessness. It’s the dark matter holding us all together.” <words>153</words>
The photograph developed, stark and grainy, the seaweed a dark, tangled line against Silas’s weary face. <words>169</words>
Tiber took another, then another, each capturing a slightly different angle, a subtle shift in Silas’s expression. <words>186</words>
He arranged the photos in a crescent shape on the table, the arcs mirroring the curve of a fading smile. <words>203</words>
“See?” Tiber said with mischievous wisdom. “The fear is still there, but it’s…contained. Shaped. Less a throne, more a shadow.” <words>223</words>
Silas studied the images, a flicker of something akin to peace settling within him. The seaweed, the photos, the diner – it was all a strange, beautiful distraction. <words>244</words>
He realized renewal wasn’t about erasing fear, but about acknowledging its presence and finding a way to live alongside it, to give it form, to make it…manageable. <words>267</words>
“It’s not about winning, Tiber,” Silas murmured, picking up another strand of seaweed. “It’s about enduring with a little bit of grace.” <words>286</words>
Tiber chuckled, already preparing a fresh pot of coffee. “Between rides, General. Between rides.” <words>301</words>
Silas smiled, a genuine smile this time, and felt a lightness he hadn’t experienced in decades. The throne remained, but the kingdom felt a little less bleak. <words>323</words>
He knew the anxieties would return, but now he had a map, a series of black-and-white arcs, and a handful of dried seaweed to guide him through the darkness. <words>343</words>
The diner’s neon sign flickered, promising another ride, another chance to renew, another moment of mischievous wisdom. <words>360</words>
