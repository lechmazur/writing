Old Man Tiber, an insomniac painter whose arboreal workshop swayed gently among giant, bioluminescent mushrooms, hadn’t slept properly in decades. <31> He preferred the quiet hours, the hush of an empty classroom at first light mirroring the stillness he sought, though never found, within himself. <51> His paintings were famous for their cheerfully rendered portraits, each face beaming with a painted smile, yet Tiber knew the truth: behind the painted smiles lay a hollow ache, a universal sorrow he felt compelled to both capture and conceal. <84> 

He discovered a method to glimpse these hidden truths – by scrying in puddles after midnight, a practice most dismissed as eccentric rambling. <107> Tonight, the puddle showed not a face, but an object: a tapered wizard’s hat, inexplicably marred by a single, clean bullet hole. <131> It pulsed with a strange energy, a resonance that tugged at the edges of Tiber’s awareness. <144> He knew, with a certainty that bypassed logic, that this hat represented the final obstacle, the last barrier to finally outlasting the grief that haunted him. <171>

Tiber’s workshop was peacefully chaotic, canvases stacked haphazardly, brushes overflowing from jars, the air thick with the scent of linseed oil and regret. <194> He hadn’t always been this way; once, he’d painted joy, genuine joy, before… before the loss that had fractured his world. <215> Now, he felt compelled to devour the sadness of others, to absorb their pain into his art, transforming it into something beautiful, something bearable. <238> 

He began to paint the hat, meticulously recreating every thread, every shadow, the stark contrast of the bullet hole. <259> As he worked, the hat in the puddle seemed to…shift, to whisper secrets in a language he almost understood. <277> The painting wasn’t merely a representation; it was a conduit, drawing the sorrow associated with the hat into Tiber’s being. <296> He felt a wave of exhaustion, but also a strange sense of liberation. <308> The final brushstroke completed the portrait, and the puddle went still, reflecting only the faint glow of the mushrooms. <327> Tiber finally understood: the obstacle wasn’t to *avoid* sorrow, but to embrace it, to transform it, to paint beyond the smiles. <348> He closed his eyes, a genuine, weary smile finally touching his own lips, and for the first time in decades, drifted towards sleep. <369> The workshop continued to sway, a peaceful haven amidst the giant fungi. <380>
