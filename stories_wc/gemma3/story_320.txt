Old Man Tiber, they called him, though he wasn’t particularly old, just… withdrawn, a shy diviner haunting the silt-choked stalls of Aethelburg, the forgotten underwater city market. <14> He didn’t offer fortunes, not exactly; he simply *saw* them, layered like sediment, and mostly ignored them with a passionate disinterest. <31> His stall wasn’t filled with crystals or tarot cards, but with vintage photographs, each one radiating a confusingly clear sorrow. <49> They weren’t portraits of people he knew, but echoes – glimpses into parallel timelines, fractured by a cosmic imbalance he felt compelled to right. <70> 

He’d discovered the source of the disruption in a faded daguerreotype of a woman named Elara, a clockmaker from a timeline where Aethelburg hadn’t sunk. <89> Elara’s regret, a decision to prioritize ambition over love, resonated across realities, weakening the barriers between worlds. <107> Tiber began to precipitate a plan, a desperate attempt to mend the tear. <115> It wasn’t a grand spell or a heroic quest, but something far stranger: a trail of social media posts. <129>

Using salvaged tech, he uploaded the photographs, subtly altering their metadata to appear as if they were recent discoveries, each post hinting at Elara’s story. <149> He didn’t seek followers or engagement, only observation – to see if the collective awareness of her regret could somehow… shift things. <167> The posts showed Elara’s workshop, her intricate clocks, and finally, a blurred image of the man she’d left behind. <186> 

Across timelines, people began to feel a phantom ache, a sense of loss for a life unlived. <198> Tiber watched, detached, as the echoes grew stronger, the boundaries between realities flickering. <212> He saw glimpses of Aethelburg rising, then falling again, the timelines unstable. <224> Then, a new photograph appeared in his collection, unbidden – Elara, older, holding the hand of the man she’d chosen, a faint smile on her face. <246> 

The ache subsided, the flickering stopped. <252> Aethelburg remained submerged, but the cosmic imbalance had lessened, the tear mended, not by changing the past, but by acknowledging its weight. <273> Tiber, with a shrug, rearranged his photographs, the sorrow still present, but muted, less… insistent. <289> He continued his passionate disinterest, a silent guardian of timelines, forever haunted by the echoes of regret. <306> Another photograph materialized, a child playing amongst the ruins of a sunlit Aethelburg, a hopeful anomaly. <323> He didn’t smile, but a flicker of something akin to peace crossed his face. <333> The diviner returned to sorting, the weight of worlds momentarily lifted. <342>
