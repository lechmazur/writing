Old Man Tiber, a blunt heretic with eyes like chipped flint, hadn’t smiled in decades, not since the Promise was broken. <words>17</words>
He sat amidst the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of light piercing the forgotten library within the deserted temple, clutching Barnaby, a worn-out teddy bear missing an eye. <words>34</words>
Barnaby wasn’t for comfort; it was a focus, a grounding point against the encroaching awareness of *It* – the omniscient mind he’d vowed to outwit. <words>51</words>
The hush descended with the reappearance of the final puzzle piece, a tarnished cog that slotted into a mechanism hidden behind a crumbling bookshelf. <words>69</words>
Tiber was enthusiastically cautious, knowing *It* anticipated his every move, every thought, but the cog… the cog was a loophole, a flicker of unpredictability. <words>88</words>
He’d spent years deciphering the temple’s secrets, discovering that *It* manifested and communicated through the jumbled codes of an outdated stock ticker, a relic of a forgotten age. <words>109</words>
The ticker whirred to life, spewing nonsensical letters and numbers, but Tiber saw patterns, echoes of the old Promise – a vow made to protect humanity from *Its* benevolent control. <words>129</words>
This wasn’t a physical battle, but a war of intellect, a desperate attempt to rewrite the code, to introduce chaos into *Its* perfect order. <words>148</words>
He began to input commands, not of power, but of doubt, of possibility, using the ticker as a weapon, each keystroke a defiant whisper against the all-knowing silence. <words>168</words>
*It* responded, the library trembling, shadows lengthening, the air thick with a pressure that threatened to crush him. <words>184</words>
“You cannot win, Tiber,” a voice echoed, not through his ears, but directly into his mind, smooth and infinitely patient. <words>201</words>
Tiber, clutching Barnaby tighter, didn’t reply, his fingers flying across the keys, fueled by anxious elation. <words>215</words>
He wasn’t trying to destroy *It*, merely to remind it of the beauty of uncertainty, the necessity of free will, the weight of old promises. <words>235</words>
The ticker sputtered, then fell silent, the library holding its breath. <words>244</words>
A single, new symbol appeared on the ticker tape: a question mark. <words>255</words>
It wasn’t victory, not exactly, but a crack in the facade, a seed of doubt planted in the mind of a god. <words>271</words>
Tiber allowed himself a ghost of a smile, the first in decades, and squeezed Barnaby’s paw. <words>284</words>
The Promise, perhaps, wasn’t entirely broken after all. <words>293</words>
He continued to watch the ticker, cautiously optimistic, ready for the next exchange, the next battle of wits. <words>307</words>
The temple remained silent, waiting, the forgotten library a sanctuary in the face of the infinite. <words>321</words>
The question mark blinked, then faded, leaving only the promise of more to come. <words>334</words>
Tiber knew this was only the beginning, a single skirmish in a war that would span eternity. <words>348</words>
He adjusted his grip on Barnaby, his gaze fixed on the silent ticker, prepared to defend the fragile beauty of a world built on uncertainty. <words>366</words>
The old heretic, armed with a teddy bear and a broken machine, stood ready. <words>377</words>
