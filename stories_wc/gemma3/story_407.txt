Old Man Tiber, they called me, though I wasn’t *that* old, just perpetually shadowed by bad forecasts and worse luck, a meteorologist drawn to cosmic events like moths to a dying star. <31> I’d taken a shortcut through the abandoned subway tunnels beneath what was once Chicago, hoping to reach the bioluminescent fungal farms before the surface dwellers realized the shift in atmospheric pressure. <54> It was a systematically chaotic system down here, wires dangling like vines, water dripping with a rhythmic despair, and then, the city. <74> Not human, not quite – an underground city of lizard people, scales gleaming faintly in the phosphorescent glow, their architecture a disturbing blend of organic curves and precise geometry. <99> 

I’d come to study plant behaviors, specifically how the fungi reacted to subtle shifts in geomagnetic fields, but this…this was unexpected. <118> A lizard woman, taller than any I’d seen, intercepted me, her eyes like polished obsidian, and in her hand, she held a mariner’s sextant, impossibly ancient and gleaming with a strange energy. <146> “You seek knowledge,” she rasped, her voice a dry rustle of leaves, “but knowledge demands a price: spoken truths.” <165> 

Apparently, their society functioned on absolute honesty, a brutal system between colliding interests of various clans, and I, a man whose profession was built on calculated probabilities and softened predictions, was a walking paradox. <192> She proposed a spar – not of fists, but of words, a contest of unvarnished truth. <205> I, who habitually couched everything in ‘likely’ and ‘potential,’ was to lay bare my soul. <221> 

The first few rounds were agonizing; every evasion, every carefully constructed phrase, earned a stinging rebuke from the lizard woman and a ripple of disapproval from the observing crowd. <248> I confessed my failures, my self-doubt, the bitter honey of a life spent predicting storms that always seemed to find me anyway. <271> With each truth, the sextant pulsed, and the air grew thick with a strange, sweet scent. <286> I spoke of my fascination with the fungi, not for scientific glory, but for a desperate hope of finding order in chaos, a pattern in the unpredictable. <308> Finally, exhausted and raw, I admitted my deepest fear: that I was, at heart, a fraud. <326> The lizard woman lowered the sextant, a flicker of something akin to respect in her eyes. <338> “You have paid the price,” she said, “and the fungi await.” <351> She gestured towards a hidden passage, and I, the unlucky meteorologist, walked towards the light, forever changed by the weight of spoken truths. <370>
