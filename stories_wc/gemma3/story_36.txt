Old Man Tiber, a calm doomsayer if ever there was one, sat amidst the brass and gears of his steampunk workshop, the hush of a barn loft just after sunrise clinging to the dust motes dancing in the golden light. <30> He hadn’t touched a tool in weeks, not since… well, since the forgetting began. <42> Before him lay a battered old skateboard covered in stickers – faded band logos, political slogans, and childish drawings, a relic of a life he barely recognized as his own. <64> It represented everything slipping away, the vibrant chaos traded for a sterile, predictable order imposed by the Council. <82> 

Tiber was, to put it mildly, faithfully odd; he collected broken things, not to fix them, but to remember what they *were*. <98> He believed the Council, with their clockwork precision and insistence on ‘optimization’, were stealing not just memories, but the very capacity for wonder. <118> He needed to *do* something, to slam a door on the gods of stagnation, even if it was a futile gesture. <134> 

His hand hovered over a thick, leather-bound resume, a document he hadn’t looked at in decades. <148> It detailed a life of invention, of joyful, reckless creation – a stark contrast to the Council’s approved ‘improvements’. <166> He wasn’t applying for a job, not exactly. <171> It was a declaration, a middle finger to the grey conformity that had settled over the land. <189> He planned to submit it to the Council, knowing full well it would be rejected, dismissed as the ramblings of a senile eccentric. <209>

Then, a sound cut through the silence – the mournful wail of a distant train whistle. <225> It wasn’t a regular train; the Council had outlawed unscheduled travel years ago. <239> The whistle resonated with a forgotten longing, a yearning for the open road, for the unpredictable. <256> Tiber felt a surge of placid ferocity, a quiet determination bloom in his chest. <271> He grabbed a pen, not to amend the resume, but to add a single line at the bottom: “Skills include remembering what you’ve forgotten.” <292> 

He sealed the envelope, the skateboard a silent witness to his defiance. <304> The train whistle sounded again, closer this time, a promise of something… different. <318> He would deliver this resume himself, and let the Council choke on the ghost of a lost innocence. <334> It wasn’t about changing their minds; it was about refusing to be silenced. <348> The sound of the train, a beacon in the encroaching grey, fueled his resolve. <362> He was ready. <365>
