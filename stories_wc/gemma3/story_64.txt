Old Man Tiber, an uncertain alchemist more comfortable with bubbling concoctions than people, adjusted his spectacles, the floating marketplace swaying gently beneath him. <words>14</words>
The market, a chaotic tangle of stalls tethered to a constellation of hot air balloons, hummed with a nervous energy; it was the hush before the judge read the verdict in the Sky-Thief trial. <words>31</words>
Tiber wasn’t interested in justice, only in safeguarding something far more precious – a cracked scale, iridescent and warm to the touch, shed by a long-vanished Sky Serpent. <words>49</words>
He’d acquired it decades ago, believing it held the key to immortality, though he suspected, with growing dread, that such a gift always demanded a price. <words>67</words>
His research, driven by a peculiar motivation to meticulously map the forest trails below, had led him to believe the scale’s power wasn’t in consumption, but in preservation. <words>87</words>
The scale needed a specific resonance, a pattern only found within the coded scuffs on the marble floor of the abandoned Celestial Observatory, a place technically wild even amongst these civilized clouds. <words>108</words>
For years, he’d been charting those scuffs, each one a glyph representing a lost moment, a forgotten life, a potential extension of his own. <words>128</words>
He traced the pattern with a calloused finger, the floor cool beneath his touch, ignoring the hawkers peddling dream-dust and bottled starlight. <words>147</words>
The scale pulsed faintly as he aligned it with a particularly intricate swirl, a scuff representing the last known sighting of the Serpent, a moment of breathtaking, terrifying beauty. <words>168</words>
He wasn’t seeking eternal youth, not precisely; he simply wanted *more* time, more chances to complete his maps, to understand the whispering forests. <words>188</words>
But the air grew thick, and a strange lethargy settled over him, a subtle draining of vitality – the price, he realized, wasn’t a grand sacrifice, but a slow, mundane erosion of self. <words>209</words>
Each mapped trail, each extended moment, chipped away at his memories, his passions, his very essence, leaving behind a hollow echo of the man he once was. <words>229</words>
He continued to trace the scuffs, driven by a compulsion he no longer understood, a puppet dancing to the tune of a forgotten god. <words>248</words>
The judge’s voice boomed across the marketplace, announcing the Sky-Thief’s sentence, but Tiber didn’t hear it; he was too busy becoming a ghost in his own life, a testament to the quiet, devastating power of immortality. <words>271</words>
He added another mark to his map, a tiny, insignificant line representing a lost memory, a forgotten face, a piece of himself surrendered to the endless, echoing expanse of time. <words>293</words>
The scale glowed brighter, and Tiber felt…less. <words>300</words>
It was a mundane miracle, a quiet tragedy unfolding amidst the vibrant chaos of the floating market, a secret etched into the coded scuffs of a forgotten observatory floor. <words>320</words>
He continued his work, a hollow shell safeguarding a stolen eternity, forever mapping trails he would no longer remember walking. <words>338</words>
The price, he understood now, wasn’t just his life, but the very meaning of it. <words>351</words>
