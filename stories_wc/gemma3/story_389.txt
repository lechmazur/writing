Old Man Tiber, a thin-lipped warlock with a disconcerting habit of addressing dust motes, adjusted his spectacles as the final calendar page of the year flipped, marking the descent into a new, uncertain cycle. <words>22</words>
He was in the forgotten library, carved into the heart of an abandoned mine, a place smelling of damp earth and decaying paper – precisely to his liking. <words>36</words>
Tiber’s manner was formally casual; he’d offer you tea while discussing the finer points of soul transference, as if it were a matter of garden variety gossip. <words>53</words>
He sought to optimize his longevity, not through conventional means, but through rumored cures detailed in discredited textbooks, volumes dismissed by the ‘modern’ magical community. <words>72</words>
His current obsession revolved around lost artifacts, specifically, a fragment of a viking ship figurehead, rumored to contain echoes of ancient, pre-rune healing practices. <words>92</words>
He believed the wood held the key to reversing a subtle, creeping entropy he felt within his own magical core. <words>106</words>
The figurehead fragment, a snarling wolf’s head carved from dark oak, lay on a table cluttered with alchemical equipment and crumbling tomes. <words>123</words>
Tiber wasn’t driven by a fear of death, but by a gluttonous desire to gorge on the fruit of knowledge, despite the warnings scribbled in the margins of forbidden texts. <words>143</words>
“Such tiresome cautions,” he muttered, tracing the wolf’s chipped teeth with a long, pale finger. <words>155</words>
He’d spent decades deciphering the texts, convinced the authors weren’t mad, merely… ahead of their time, or privy to truths others couldn’t bear. <words>174</words>
The textbooks spoke of ‘resonant transference,’ a process of imbuing oneself with the vitality of objects steeped in history and power. <words>191</words>
Tiber had constructed a complex array of crystals and wires, intending to amplify the figurehead’s residual energy and channel it into his own being. <words>210</words>
He felt a confusing certainty that this would work, a conviction born not of logic, but of a deep, unsettling intuition. <words>227</words>
The air crackled with energy as he initiated the process, the wolf’s head seeming to pulse with a faint, inner light. <words>243</words>
He ignored the growing tremor in his hands, the unsettling chill that spread through the library, dismissing them as mere side effects. <words>261</words>
The textbooks hadn’t mentioned the sensation of being… unmade, of his memories dissolving into the wood’s ancient grain. <words>279</words>
He continued to optimize, adjusting the flow of energy, even as his form began to flicker, becoming less substantial with each passing moment. <words>296</words>
The last thing Tiber saw, before dissolving completely into the swirling energy, was the wolf’s head, its carved eyes gleaming with a knowing, ancient hunger. <words>316</words>
The library fell silent, the only sound the drip, drip, drip of water echoing through the abandoned mine, guarding its secrets and the warlock’s foolish ambition. <words>337</words>
