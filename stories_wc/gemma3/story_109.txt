Sir Kaelen, a knight known more for the chill in his demeanor than chivalry, stood at the deserted intersection, the streetlights casting long, skeletal shadows. <16> He wasn’t awaiting a damsel, but a contact – a low-level operative from the Obsidian Archive, a secret agent center disguised as a historical society. <31> Kaelen’s mission wasn’t espionage, however; he was collecting folk remedies, whispered cures passed down through generations, believing they held a power lost to formalized medicine. <51> Tonight’s exchange involved information on a poultice for ‘soul-sickness,’ and he’d been instructed to leave payment at the base of the defunct traffic signal. <71>

He noticed it then – a single, brightly colored child’s mitten, lying forlornly near the curb. <83> Kaelen, a man who rarely registered emotion, felt a strange tug, a flicker of something unfamiliar. <96> He picked it up, the wool soft against his gauntleted hand, and a memory surfaced: his own sister, lost to fever before he’d even been knighted. <116> The operative arrived, a nervous woman named Elara, and Kaelen handed over a small, intricately carved wooden box – his payment. <135>

But instead of accepting it immediately, Elara pointed to a series of small, makeshift altars tucked into the shadows of the buildings, each dedicated to a different ancestor, yet conspicuously incomplete. <162> “The Archivist supports those who remember,” she explained, “but only those who acknowledge what’s *missing* from their lineage.” <179> Kaelen understood; the Archivist, a lawfully rebellious figure within the agency, believed wholeness came from acknowledging past hurts, not erasing them. <201> 

He began leaving small offerings at the altars – a polished stone, a feather, and finally, the child’s mitten. <218> As he placed it on the altar dedicated to lost children, a wave of emotion washed over him, a raw, aching grief he hadn’t known he possessed. <238> He felt… compelled to sketch the scene in the dust with a twig, capturing the stark geometry of the intersection, the lonely mitten, the flickering streetlights. <261> It was clumsy, imperfect, but undeniably *something*. <268> 

This was his artistic awakening, born not of joy, but of sorrow and a small, lost piece of childhood. <285> He continued to support the Archivist’s quiet rebellion, understanding now that true healing – for the soul, and perhaps for himself – lay in acknowledging the fragments of the past. <307> The remedies he collected weren’t just for the body, but for the fractured spirit, and he, the cold-natured knight, was becoming their unlikely custodian. <328> He left the intersection, a changed man, the image of the mitten burned into his memory. <342>
