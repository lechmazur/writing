Old Man Tiber, a lingering minstrel whose songs had long faded into background noise, found himself, improbably, in a giant’s dining room amid rush hour – though the rush consisted solely of dust motes dancing in the colossal sunbeams. <30> He was openly private, preferring the company of his own melancholic tunes to the clamor of taverns, and desperately sought to escape a mundane existence filled with lukewarm ale and polite, empty praise. <56> The dining room, abandoned centuries ago, smelled of woodsmoke and forgotten feasts, a comforting scent that did little to soothe the gentle turmoil within him. <78>

He hadn’t intended to rejuvenate himself, not precisely, but the stories whispered in forgotten corners of the world had led him here, to this impossible space, and to the peculiar method required. <104> It involved a meteorite, a fragment of a fallen star resting on the giant’s table, and the texture of its surface – a chaotic map of cosmic energy. <126> But more importantly, it required a catalyst, something to focus the energy, and Tiber clutched a witch’s gnarled wooden ladle, its handle worn smooth by countless brews and incantations. <151>

He ran a trembling hand over the meteorite’s pitted surface, the cold metal a shock against his skin. <167> The ladle, held aloft, began to hum, a low thrum that resonated not with sound, but with a profound, internal stillness. <189> He didn’t speak, didn’t sing, didn’t even *think* in words; the rejuvenation wasn’t achieved through action, but through a deliberate absence of it. <216> It was affirmed by silence, a letting go of the anxieties and regrets that had weighed him down for decades. <236> 

The room seemed to breathe with him, the dust motes swirling faster, then slowing, mirroring the ebb and flow of energy within his own aging body. <259> He felt not a surge of youthful vigor, but a quiet acceptance, a deepening of his inner landscape. <277> The mundane hadn’t vanished, but its grip had loosened; he could return to it, not as an escapee, but as a traveler, carrying the vastness of the cosmos within him. <303> The ladle cooled, the humming ceased, and Tiber, still old, still a minstrel, felt…whole. <318> He understood now that true rejuvenation wasn’t about reversing time, but about finding peace within its passage. <338> He carefully placed the ladle back on the table, a silent thank you to the long-gone witch, and prepared to rejoin the world, changed not in appearance, but in spirit. <364> The giant’s dining room, once a refuge, now felt like a launching pad. <370>
