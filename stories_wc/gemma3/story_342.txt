Old Man Tiber, a carelessly piloted drone of a man, traced the damp leather of his worn-out glove, a relic from a life he barely remembered as his own. <30> The lull between echoing thunder and fresh rain hung heavy over the enchanted oak grove, a place locals whispered held stolen moments and fractured timelines. <49> He wasn’t here for the magic, not precisely; Tiber was driven by a resigned exuberance to archive natural patterns, the spiraling growth of fungi, the fractal branching of trees, anything to impose order on the chaos he felt within. <78> 

He’d been drawn to this twisted orchard labyrinth by the postcards – dozens of them, found tucked into the hollows of ancient trees, each bearing sinister doodles in faded ink. <98> They weren’t threats, not exactly, but unsettling glimpses into someone else’s… recollections. <110> Tiber suspected they held borrowed memories, fragments of lives lived and lost within the grove, and he believed deciphering them was the key to understanding the strange pull he felt. <133>

Each doodle seemed to unlock a fleeting sensation, a phantom limb, a forgotten taste – not his own. <148> He’d begun to suspect the grove didn’t just *hold* memories, it *shared* them, leaching experiences into anyone who lingered too long. <167> The postcards were a map, a fragmented guide to navigating this psychic landscape. <178> 

Today’s card depicted a single, gnarled apple, crossed out with frantic lines. <191> As Tiber studied it, a wave of longing washed over him, a desperate need to… to what? <201> He realized the grove wasn’t just offering memories, it was offering a chance to emancipate himself from the weight of his own, or rather, the lack of them. <223> 

He wasn’t trying to *recover* a past, but to shed the feeling of being a vessel filled with echoes. <239> The deliberately dreamy quality of the grove, once unsettling, now felt like a balm. <251> He continued deeper into the labyrinth, following the trail of postcards, each one a step towards a self he hadn’t known he’d lost, or perhaps, never had. <274> He understood now: the archive wasn’t of the orchard, but of the selves it held, and by understanding them, he could finally be free. <296> The rain began to fall again, washing away the dust and revealing the next postcard, a single, hopeful bloom. <314> He smiled, a genuine, unborrowed expression. <321>
