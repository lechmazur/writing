Old Man Tiber, a bookbinder with a gift for moving things with his mind, preferred strictly casual attire – faded overalls and a perpetually stained shirt. <words>18</words>
He sat within the dilapidated shell of a carnival prize booth, the chipped paint whispering tales of forgotten laughter and rigged games. <words>31</words>
Dust motes danced in the single shaft of sunlight illuminating a peculiar object clutched in his hand: a single, crumpled chopstick wrapper, salvaged from a decades-old Chinese takeout container. <words>49</words>
It wasn’t the wrapper itself he sought, but the echoes it held, the faint sonic residue of a life lived, a meal shared, a conversation overheard – sound bites capable of triggering the flashbacks he needed. <words>68</words>
Tiber wasn’t interested in remembering *his* past; he sought to revive the lost legends, to understand the price of knowledge across the tapestry of lost civilizations. <words>87</words>
He believed transformation, true and lasting, wasn’t about altering the present, but understanding the echoes of what *was*. <words>103</words>
Focusing his telekinetic ability, he amplified the microscopic vibrations within the paper, and a snippet of Cantonese drifted into the booth – a woman’s voice, discussing alchemy. <words>124</words>
Suddenly, Tiber wasn’t in the crumbling booth anymore; he *was* a scholar in ancient Chang’an, witnessing a forbidden ritual, the air thick with incense and the scent of mercury. <words>145</words>
Another sound bite, a burst of Parisian cafe chatter from the wrapper, and he was observing Marie Curie painstakingly isolate radium, understanding the dangerous allure of discovery. <words>167</words>
Each flash was fleeting, a fragmented glimpse, but they revealed a pattern: every great leap in understanding demanded a sacrifice, a piece of oneself surrendered to the universe. <words>189</words>
He saw a Mayan priest offering his sight for prophetic visions, a Norse rune caster trading years of his life for a single, potent spell. <words>209</words>
The chopstick wrapper, a mundane object, was a key, unlocking doors to epochs he’d only dreamed of, revealing the consistent, agonizing cost of enlightenment. <words>229</words>
Tiber realized transformation wasn’t a gift, but a transaction; power wasn’t gained, but exchanged. <words>243</words>
He focused again, seeking the ultimate lesson, the core principle governing all these sacrifices, and a final sound bite emerged – a child’s simple question: “What are you willing to forget?” <words>266</words>
The booth solidified around him, the wrapper falling from his limp hand. <words>276</words>
He understood now; the price of knowledge wasn’t something given *to* you, it was something you willingly relinquished. <words>292</words>
His telekinetic power, once a tool for seeking, now felt… lighter, as if a burden had been lifted, a memory willingly surrendered. <words>308</words>
Tiber smiled, a genuinely casual expression, finally grasping the grandiose subtlety of true transformation. <words>322</words>
The abandoned carnival booth felt less like a ruin and more like a quiet sanctuary, a testament to the echoes of lives lived and lessons learned. <words>339</words>
He had found what he sought, not in power, but in the beautiful, heartbreaking price of understanding. <words>354</words>
