Old Man Tiber, an eager brewer with a gleefully morose disposition, hadn’t seen a customer in cycles. <words>17</words>
He spent his days in the forgotten research facility, a relic of the old Aeravani Empire, now caught between transitions to the rising Kael’Thas Dominion. <words>32</words>
Dust motes danced in the shafts of pale light filtering through cracked skylights, illuminating rows of dormant machinery and cobweb-draped consoles. <words>48</words>
Tiber would sweep the polished concrete floors, a rhythmic task that echoed in the cavernous halls, hoping to stir some memory from the stone itself. <words>65</words>
His gaze often fell upon a narrow door, left ajar for decades, its wood scarred and faded, and he’d sweep through the scuffs on it, imagining who had passed through last. <words>85</words>
He wasn’t brewing for profit; he was brewing to rekindle a dying realm, believing the Aeravani’s spirit resided in their forgotten concoctions. <words>103</words>
Each batch was a whispered plea to the stars, a hope that someone, somewhere, remembered the empire’s golden age. <words>118</words>
He wore a pair of worn leather boots, relics from his grandfather, a master distiller who’d served the Aeravani court. <words>135</words>
The leather was cracked and softened with age, molding to his feet like a second skin, each scuff a story of a life spent in service. <words>152</words>
Tonight, as he swept, a figure emerged from the shadows, a Kael’Thas scout, young and wary. <words>167</words>
“I smelled…something different,” the scout admitted, his hand resting on the hilt of his blade. <words>181</words>
Tiber offered him a glass of his latest brew, a shimmering amber liquid infused with star-petal blossoms. <words>196</words>
They sat amidst the decaying technology, engaging in starlit conversations, not of empires or dominion, but of loss, memory, and the bittersweet beauty of endings. <words>217</words>
The scout spoke of his own people’s struggles, the weight of conquest, the emptiness of victory. <words>232</words>
Tiber listened, offering only the quiet comfort of his brew and the shared understanding of a realm fading into legend. <words>249</words>
He learned the scout’s name was Lyra, and she confessed a longing for something *more* than just power. <words>265</words>
“Your grandfather’s boots…they’ve seen things,” Lyra observed, noticing the worn leather. <words>279</words>
Tiber smiled, a rare and genuine expression. “They have, child. They have.” <words>291</words>
Perhaps, he thought, rekindling a realm wasn’t about restoring an empire, but about preserving the stories within it, one starlit conversation, one shared drink, at a time. <words>314</words>
The scent of brewing herbs mingled with the dust of ages, a crisp nostalgia hanging in the air, a fragile hope blooming in the heart of a forgotten place. <words>334</words>
He continued to sweep, not just the floor, but the echoes of the past, knowing that even in transition, beauty could still be found. <words>352</words>
