Old Man Tiber, a nostalgic tailor whose hands remembered every stitch of a life lived amongst gears and steam, stood on the highest level of the Aethelburg Observation Deck, the city sprawling below like a clockwork dream. <30> The last code had been broken weeks ago, unlocking the secrets of ascension – a way to shed mortal coils and join the aether, a goal that consumed him with hopeful desperation. <51> Rain lashed against the brass and glass of the deck, a familiar rhythm that always loosened his tongue, and tonight, the storm felt particularly…subtly menacing. <73> He adjusted the spectacles perched on his nose, his gaze falling upon a dusty mirror propped against a support beam, a relic salvaged from a forgotten theatre. <95> 

He hadn’t touched it in years, fearing what reflections it might offer, but tonight, he felt compelled to look. <111> It wasn’t his own face that startled him, but the fleeting image superimposed over it – a man identical to himself, yet dressed in the uniform of a Sky Guard, a life Tiber had always secretly envied. <138> This was the echo of a parallel life, a possibility unrealized. <147> A young engineer, Elara, sought shelter beside him, her face pale with worry about the escalating storm. <167> 

“It’s just the pressure differentials, Elara,” Tiber said, attempting to reassure her, though his voice trembled slightly. <184> “The deck always groans like this during a convergence.” <195> But he wasn’t speaking of atmospheric pressure; he was referring to the thinning veil between worlds, the moments when glimpses of other selves bled through. <218> He began an improbable confession, a habit born of these storms. <228> “I once dreamt of being a pilot, you know? Of charting the aether currents, not mending coats.” <247> 

Elara looked at him, surprised. <251> “But you’re the finest tailor in Aethelburg, sir.” <262> “Perhaps,” Tiber admitted, “but in another life, I believe I soared amongst the clouds.” <277> He continued, revealing his obsession with ascension, his belief that breaking the final code wasn’t about technological advancement, but about finding a way to merge with these other selves, to become *more* than one man. <303> The mirror flickered, showing the Sky Guard again, this time smiling, a gesture of encouragement. <317> “Don’t be afraid, child,” Tiber murmured to Elara, his voice gaining strength. “Even in the storm, there is always a path upward.” <336> He believed, with a desperate hope, that ascension wasn’t an escape from life, but a joining of all lives he could have lived. <355>
