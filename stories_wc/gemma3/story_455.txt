Old Man Tiber, a disgruntled wishing-well attendant, hadn’t smiled in decades, not since the war and the… incidents. <words>17</words>
He spent his days meticulously cataloging the collection of foreign coins tossed into the well, each one a tiny, metallic weight mirroring the ones he carried inside. <words>32</words>
The well wasn’t just a tourist trap; it was a crucial node in a forgotten secret agent escape route, a network built at the crossing of two unwritten paths beneath the city. <words>51</words>
Tiber, surprisingly, was intensely relaxed about the whole thing, having long ago accepted his peculiar role as gatekeeper and silent observer. <words>68</words>
He’d learned to read the flow of people, not by their faces, but by following shadow patterns – a skill honed over years of watching for the telltale signs of those fleeing unseen enemies. <words>88</words>
The weight of scars, both visible and hidden, had taught him patience, and a grim understanding of human desperation. <words>105</words>
Today, a woman with eyes like chipped flint approached, dropping a tarnished peso into the well. <words>119</words>
Tiber watched her shadow lengthen and distort, confirming his suspicions – she was one of *them*, though a new face. <words>136</words>
A younger agent, sleek and efficient, appeared moments later, attempting to corroborate her story with the local authorities. <words>153</words>
Tiber knew better; he’d seen this dance before, the careful lies, the manufactured alibis. <words>168</words>
He’d spent years trying to out-face the silent judgments of old ghosts, the agents who hadn’t made it, their failures echoing in the damp stone of the well. <words>191</words>
He didn’t interfere directly, that wasn’t his place, but he could subtly guide, offering a knowing glance or a strategically placed coin. <words>208</words>
The woman’s shadow flickered, revealing a hidden compartment in her boot – a data chip, undoubtedly. <words>224</words>
Tiber tossed a Romanian leu into the well, its copper glint catching the light, a silent signal to a contact further down the line. <words>243</words>
He wasn’t saving the world, not anymore; he was simply maintaining the system, a cog in a machine built on secrets and sacrifice. <words>262</words>
The inherited mystery of the well, the weight of countless untold stories, settled around him like a shroud. <words>278</words>
He continued to sort his coins, each one a fragment of a life, a whisper of a journey, a testament to the enduring power of hope and despair. <words>298</words>
The shadows shifted, the agents moved on, and Tiber remained, the disgruntled guardian of a forgotten path, forever bound to the well and its silent, metallic burden. <words>321</words>
He knew they would be back, or others like them, and he would be here, watching, waiting, and cataloging the endless stream of wishes and secrets. <words>342</words>
The well held more than water; it held the echoes of lives lived and lost, and Tiber, the keeper of those echoes, would not forget. <words>362</words>
He adjusted his worn cap, a small, defiant gesture against the encroaching darkness, and resumed his work, the weight of the scars a familiar comfort. <words>380</words>
