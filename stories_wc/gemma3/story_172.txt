Old Man Tiber, an unsettled guide with eyes like chipped flint, hadn’t spoken a full sentence in decades, not since the prophecy began to chase him. <words>17</words>
He sat within the echoing curve of a giant seashell, bleached white by sun and salt, on a beach utterly devoid of footprints – a place time seemed to forget. <words>32</words>
It was after the last photo had been snapped, he figured, in that long, deserted hallway of the Azurean Archive, that the real pursuit began. <words>49</words>
He clutched a wooden puzzle box, its surface worn smooth with worry and countless attempts to unlock its architectural secrets. <words>66</words>
The box wasn’t a treasure map, not exactly; it held the key to *reversing* the prophecy, a series of intricate mechanisms designed to align with celestial events. <words>84</words>
Tiber hadn’t sought heroism, accidental or otherwise; he simply wanted to outrun the inevitable, the doom foretold for his lineage. <words>101</words>
The prophecy stated a descendant would either save the Sunken City or become its final, echoing ruin. <words>116</words>
He’d spent years deciphering the box’s instructions, realizing the alignment wasn’t about *making* wishes, but carefully, deliberately, reversing them. <words>134</words>
Each turn of the box’s tiny gears represented a wish uttered by a past ancestor, a desire for power, for glory, for longevity – all contributing to the city’s eventual downfall. <words>154</words>
Tiber’s sharp gentleness came from understanding the weight of those desires, the unintended consequences woven into the city’s foundations. <words>171</words>
He traced a finger over a particularly stubborn panel, remembering his grandfather’s wish for eternal rule, a wish that had birthed a tyrannical dynasty. <words>191</words>
To reverse it, he had to wish for *humility*, to align the gears to reflect a selfless act. <words>206</words>
The seashell amplified the clicking of the box, each successful alignment sending a faint tremor through the sand. <words>223</words>
He worked for hours, reversing wishes of conquest, of wealth, of immortality, until only one remained: his own mother’s desperate plea for her son’s safety. <words>246</words>
Reversing that wish… meant accepting his fate, potentially becoming the ruin the prophecy foretold. <words>262</words>
But the city’s salvation demanded a sacrifice, and Tiber, despite his fear, understood that. <words>277</words>
With trembling hands, he aligned the final gears, wishing for his own failure, for his own obscurity. <words>294</words>
A wave crashed against the shell, not with force, but with a sigh, and the beach began to shimmer, revealing the faintest outline of towers rising from the sea. <words>314</words>
The Sunken City was not saved by a hero, but by a man who wished himself away from glory, a quiet act of accidental heroism born of a desperate, reversed wish. <words>335</words>
Tiber closed his eyes, the prophecy broken, his purpose fulfilled, finally at peace within the echoing shell. <words>353</words>
He was no longer running, and the silence felt… complete. <words>365</words>
