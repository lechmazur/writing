Old Man Tiber, a late-blooming hero at sixty-two, hadn’t held a weapon in decades, preferring instead the quiet tending of his rooftop farm, a splash of green against the grey ruin of the city. <31> He wasn’t a soldier, not really, but possessed a softly militant air, born of years spent stubbornly coaxing life from poisoned soil. <49> The farm wasn’t about sustenance anymore; it was about understanding, about dissecting the architecture of cosmic balance after the Collapse. <68> He believed the key lay not in rebuilding, but in remembering what was *lost*, in feeling the gravity of loss itself. <86> 

He needed the spyglass, a mariner’s spyglass, tarnished brass and clouded lenses, rumored to show not distance, but echoes of what *had been*. <107> Old Man Hemlock, a hoarder of forgotten things, possessed it, and Tiber knew he would have to coerce the old man into parting with it. <127> Not with force, but with a carefully constructed appeal to Hemlock’s own quiet despair. <141> 

Tiber began by scouring dusty attics, not for the spyglass directly, but for things Hemlock had once loved – a chipped porcelain doll, a collection of bird feathers, a worn copy of poetry. <168> He presented these, one by one, not as trade, but as shared remembrance, speaking in the space between the first tear and the final sigh, acknowledging the weight of everything gone. <192> Hemlock, initially gruff, slowly softened, recognizing in Tiber a kindred spirit, someone who understood that grief wasn’t something to be overcome, but something to be *held*. <216>

“You see the ghosts, don’t you?” Hemlock rasped, finally, his voice thick with unshed tears. <230> He retrieved the spyglass from beneath a pile of moth-eaten blankets. <240> “It doesn’t show you where things *are*, boy, it shows you where they *were*.” <255> 

Through the lens, Tiber didn’t see distant lands, but fleeting images of a vibrant city, of laughing faces, of a world brimming with life, all overlaid on the desolate present. <281> The weight of it nearly buckled him, the gravity of loss a physical force. <293> He understood then: the balance wasn’t in preventing loss, but in acknowledging its profound and terrible beauty. <311> The farm wasn’t a defiance of the Collapse, but a memorial, a testament to everything that had been, and a reluctant awe at the universe’s capacity for both creation and destruction. <333> He lowered the spyglass, a single tear tracing a path through the dust on his cheek. <346> The echoes lingered. <350>
