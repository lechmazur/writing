Old Man Tiber, a kindly guard with eyes like faded denim, polished the chipped Formica of a table at the Cloud Cafe, a precarious haven floating amongst the lavender sky. <words>18</words>
He’d been stationed here for decades, or perhaps it only *felt* like decades – time had soft edges here, blurring into a frothy despair. <words>31</words>
His duty wasn’t to keep people *out*, but to ensure no one jumped, not into the clouds, but *from* them, back into the mundane world below. <words>47</words>
Tonight, the cafe was empty save for Elara, a woman who worshipped the horizon with the rhythm of a typewriter’s keys, a frantic, clicking devotion. <words>66</words>
She wasn’t typing *at* anything, just the sound itself, a desperate attempt to capture the hush of a grocery store at midnight, a place she’d left behind. <words>83</words>
Tiber watched her, a familiar ache in his chest; he was loyally disloyal to the cafe, to its ethereal beauty, knowing it was a gilded cage. <words>101</words>
He held a basic measuring spoon, a relic from a life he barely remembered, turning it over and over in his calloused hands. <words>117</words>
It was a strange comfort, the small, precise curve of it, a tangible anchor in the swirling uncertainty. <words>131</words>
Elara believed the horizon held a hidden promise, a way back to solid ground, to the scent of overripe peaches and the fluorescent hum of aisles. <words>150</words>
Tiber understood; he, too, yearned for something beyond the clouds, though his longing was less for a place and more for a forgotten feeling. <words>169</words>
He’d seen countless others like Elara, drawn to the cafe by the illusion of escape, only to become trapped by its gentle gravity. <words>188</words>
He’d subtly encouraged some to leave, offering a quiet word, a pointed glance towards the shimmering edge, while actively dissuading others. <words>207</words>
His disloyalty wasn’t malicious, but a twisted form of mercy, a belief that some were better suited to the dream than the reality. <words>226</words>
Tonight, he felt a pull towards Elara, a desire to help her seize that horizon, even if it meant his own quiet despair would deepen. <words>246</words>
He walked over, the measuring spoon cool in his palm, and placed it on her typewriter, a small, metallic offering. <words>263</words>
The clicking stopped. <words>266</words>
“A little measure of hope,” he murmured, his voice raspy with disuse, “for the journey ahead.” <words>282</words>
Elara looked at the spoon, then at Tiber, a flicker of something akin to understanding in her eyes. <words>297</words>
Perhaps, he thought, the soft edges of time could be reshaped, even by something as small as a measuring spoon. <words>313</words>
The cafe remained suspended, a fragile bubble against the vast, indifferent sky, and the promise of the horizon beckoned. <words>331</words>
He knew, with a weary certainty, that his work was never truly done, that the cycle of longing and escape would continue, a perpetual, frothy despair. <words>351</words>
But for tonight, a single spoon offered a sliver of possibility, a chance to rewrite the rhythm of a life. <words>368</words>
And that, Tiber realized, was enough. <words>373</words>
