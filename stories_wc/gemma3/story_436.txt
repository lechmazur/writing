Old Man Tiber, a sorrowful apothecary exiled to the obsidian fortress of Aethelgard, traced the chipped rim of a plastic spoon. <words>14</words>
Aethelgard floated impossibly above the Scorch, a desert where even memories dissolved in the heat, and Tiber had little else *to* remember. <words>27</words>
He’d spent decades collecting dream catchers, left behind by pilgrims seeking the Oracle of the Sands, hoping to decode their woven patterns – a roughly refined method, but the only one he had left. <words>44</words>
The fortress library, a vast chamber of crumbling scrolls, was his sanctuary, and tonight, he was racing against time, the heavy bronze doors scheduled to seal shut in the final minute. <words>63</words>
He needed to tempt the Oracle to speak again, to break the decades of silence that had followed her last, devastating prophecy. <words>78</words>
His motivation wasn’t power, or knowledge, but a painful joy – a desperate hope to understand the fate of his family, lost to the Scorch generations ago. <words>96</words>
The Oracle had always responded to offerings tied to family recipes, whispers of forgotten tastes, and Tiber believed he’d found the key within a particularly intricate dream catcher. <words>116</words>
The weaving depicted a specific arrangement of desert blooms, mirroring a forgotten recipe for ‘Sunstone Biscuits’ – a treat his grandmother used to bake. <words>134</words>
He’d painstakingly recreated the recipe, substituting ingredients available in Aethelgard, and the plastic spoon was the only utensil he possessed suitable for stirring the final, shimmering concoction. <words>155</words>
Now, he prepared to bifurcate the offering, splitting it into two equal portions – one for the Oracle’s chamber, and one for himself, a symbolic sharing of remembrance. <words>174</words>
He understood the Oracle didn’t *need* the biscuits, but the act of creation, the echo of his family’s love woven into the dough, was the offering itself. <words>194</words>
The library doors groaned, a warning. <words>200</words>
Tiber carefully placed one half of the biscuits on a silver platter, then, with trembling hands, tasted the other. <words>217</words>
A wave of bittersweet memory washed over him – the warmth of his grandmother’s kitchen, the scent of cinnamon, the laughter of his siblings. <words>237</words>
As the doors began to close, a voice, raspy and ancient, echoed from the Oracle’s chamber. <words>250</words>
“The sand remembers… and so do you.” <words>258</words>
Tiber didn’t ask about his family directly; he didn’t need to. <words>268</words>
The Oracle’s voice, even in its brevity, was enough – a confirmation that their memory, like the fortress, still floated above the scorching oblivion. <words>288</words>
He held the plastic spoon tight, a small, imperfect vessel holding a universe of grief and a fragile, enduring hope. <words>306</words>
The library doors slammed shut, leaving Tiber alone with his memories, and the faint, lingering scent of Sunstone Biscuits. <words>324</words>
It was a painful joy, but it was joy nonetheless. <words>333</words>
He knew, with a certainty that settled deep within his bones, that his family hadn’t been entirely lost to the Scorch. <words>351</words>
Their essence lived on, woven into the fabric of his being, and whispered on the desert wind. <words>367</words>
The plastic spoon, a humble relic, felt warm in his hand. <words>376</words>
