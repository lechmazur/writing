Old Man Tiber, the blacksmith, barely registered the newcomer’s presence as he hammered a cooling horseshoe, his face an indifferent mask of soot and weariness. <words>18</words>
The cathedral bells had just ceased their midday chime, a brief pocket of silence in the echoing maze-like catacombs beneath the stone giant. <words>31</words>
He wasn’t forging for profit anymore, not since the city above had crumbled, but for something…else, driven by a motivation he couldn’t quite name, only *felt* in the damp chill of the stone. <words>49</words>
The stranger offered no greeting, simply laying a collection of objects on Tiber’s anvil: a chipped porcelain doll, a tarnished silver locket, a handful of dried herbs, and a faded ribbon, the color of a bruised plum. <words>69</words>
Tiber didn’t look at the stranger, only at the objects, each one resonating with a uniquely natural energy, a whisper of lives lived and lost. <words>86</words>
He understood, instinctively, that these weren’t mere trinkets, but pieces of a story, a fragmented history meant to be reassembled. <words>103</words>
The stranger wished to seal a covenant with the unknown, a pact forged not in words, but in remembrance. <words>118</words>
Tiber began to work, not with fire and steel this time, but with arrangement, carefully placing each object in a specific pattern on a flat stone slab. <words>136</words>
He felt a pull, a resonance building as the arrangement neared completion, the faded ribbon acting as the linchpin, connecting all the disparate pieces. <words>154</words>
Suddenly, he let out a sharp, guttural haw, a sound that echoed strangely in the catacombs, not of pain, but of recognition, of understanding. <words>171</words>
It wasn’t a call *to* something, but a release, a yielding to the power that was already present, rising from the rubble of forgotten lives. <words>191</words>
The air thickened, shimmering with an unseen energy, and the stone slab began to glow with a soft, ethereal light. <words>207</words>
Tiber remained indifferent, his task nearly complete, his hands steady as he adjusted the doll’s position by a fraction of an inch. <words>225</words>
He wasn’t seeking power, or glory, or even understanding; he was simply a vessel, a tool for something far older and more profound. <words>244</words>
The covenant wasn’t about control, but about acceptance, about acknowledging the echoes of the past and allowing them to shape the future. <words>264</words>
As the final bell of the hour began to toll, signaling the return to the world above, the light intensified, then faded, leaving only the silent catacombs and the blacksmith, unchanged. <words>286</words>
The stranger was gone, the covenant sealed, and Tiber returned to his horseshoe, the rhythmic clang of his hammer a quiet affirmation of life rising from ruin. <words>306</words>
He didn’t need thanks, or acknowledgement, only the quiet satisfaction of a task completed, a story told, a balance restored between worlds. <words>326</words>
The objects remained on the slab, a testament to the lives remembered, a silent promise of renewal, a uniquely natural echo in the stone. <words>344</words>
Tiber hawed again, softer this time, a sound lost in the vastness of the catacombs, a simple acknowledgement of the mystery that surrounded him. <words>360</words>
