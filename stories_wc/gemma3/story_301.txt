Old Man Tiber, a random philosopher known more for his unsettling calm than coherent thought, sat amidst the relics of a jazz age time capsule, a room preserved in amber and cigarette smoke. <30> He was during knitting, needles clicking a slow, deliberate rhythm as he worked on a scarf of indeterminate color. <43> His hands, though gnarled with age, moved with surprising dexterity, pausing only to sip from an oversize pewter mug. <59> It wasn’t the tea that held his attention, but the cryptic codes etched into the mug’s surface, a language he claimed held the key to harnessing cosmic wonder. <78> 

He’d found the mug years ago, discarded amongst the flapper dresses and gramophones, and recognized its potential immediately. <92> Tiber wasn’t interested in understanding the universe; he wanted to *use* it, and the mug, he believed, was the conduit. <107> His methods were, admittedly, ethically questionable, bordering on outright malicious. <118> He intended to impair the free will of those who crossed him, subtly nudging them towards decisions that benefited his…experiments. <134>

A pair of gardening gloves, worn and stained with earth, lay beside him, a strange juxtaposition in the opulent setting. <149> They weren’t for gardening, of course. <153> Tiber used them to handle the “seeds” – small, geometrically perfect stones he’d discovered within the time capsule’s foundation. <170> Each stone, when activated by a specific sequence from the mug, emitted a frequency that subtly altered perception. <186> 

He believed people operated on predictable patterns, and that breaking expectations was the key to control. <202> The mug’s codes weren’t about prediction, but about *creating* the unexpected, forcing a divergence from the established path. <221> He watched a young journalist, sent to profile the eccentric old man, approach the room, a notepad clutched in her hand. <239> A numb fascination settled over Tiber as he selected a code, a slow smile spreading across his lips. <254> He’d chosen a sequence designed to make her question her own ambition, to find beauty in stillness rather than the relentless pursuit of a story. <275> It wasn’t about malice, he told himself, but about revealing hidden truths. <287> The journalist paused at the doorway, her expression shifting, a flicker of doubt crossing her face. <303> The knitting needles clicked on, a metronome marking the subtle unraveling of a carefully constructed life. <317> He offered her tea, the mug gleaming innocently in the dim light. <328> The cosmic wonder, he thought, was about to bloom. <337> It was a quiet power, and he savored the stillness before the shift. <348> The journalist entered, unaware of the subtle impairment beginning to take hold. <361>
