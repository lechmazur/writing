Old Man Tiber, a naive gambler with eyes that held the grey of the churning sea, haunted the tidal power monitoring station, a lonely concrete sentinel clinging to the ragged coast. <words>18</words>
He wasn’t there for the power, though; he was there for the light, specifically the flickering glow of candlelit dinners shared with Elara, the station’s sole technician, a woman he’d met during one of Professor Silas’s rebellious midnight lectures on forgotten energies. <words>36</words>
Silas, an unhinged professor Tiber had stumbled upon years ago, had filled his head with theories of unspoken bargains struck with the ocean itself, bargains fueled by luminescence. <words>54</words>
Tiber, rarely predictable, had taken Silas’s ramblings to heart, convinced that each flame held a fragment of a dying world, a spark he desperately needed to capture before oblivion claimed everything. <words>74</words>
He’d arrive at the dock each evening, a worn, rustic candle mold clutched in his hands, hoping to “borrow” a little light from Elara’s table. <words>91</words>
Elara knew his game, of course; she’d seen the way his face lit up, not with romantic interest, but with a frantic, almost desperate hope as he watched her candles burn. <words>109</words>
Their dinners weren’t dates, not exactly; they were silent exchanges, a tacit agreement built on shared loneliness and the professor’s strange teachings. <words>126</words>
He never asked for a candle, never offered payment; it was an unspoken bargain, a trade of companionship for a fleeting piece of light. <words>142</words>
Tonight, the station hummed with an unusual energy, the tidal generators straining against a particularly strong surge. <words>157</words>
Elara’s candles flickered wildly, casting dancing shadows on the concrete walls, and Tiber felt a surge of panic – the light felt… thinner. <words>174</words>
“It’s weakening,” he whispered, his voice cracking with a laughter tinged with tears. <words>186</words>
Elara simply nodded, her own eyes reflecting the frantic dance of the flames. <words>195</words>
He held out the mold, his hand trembling, and she carefully dripped the molten wax, a single tear tracing a path down her cheek. <words>212</words>
It wasn’t about preserving the light, Tiber realized, but about acknowledging its fading, about bearing witness to the end with someone, anyone. <words>231</words>
The ocean roared outside, a constant reminder of the power that both sustained and threatened them, a power that demanded its due. <words>248</words>
He knew Silas would have approved, this quiet acceptance, this understanding of the inevitable bargain. <words>263</words>
As the last drop of wax cooled, solidifying into a fragile form, Tiber felt a strange sense of peace, a laughing sort of sorrow. <words>281</words>
He wasn’t capturing a spark, he was collecting memories, preserving the echo of a light that was already gone. <words>297</words>
The station shuddered, the lights flickered, and for a moment, everything was plunged into darkness, save for the tiny, newly formed candle, a fragile beacon against the encroaching oblivion. <words>316</words>
He smiled, a single tear escaping, and offered Elara a shaky nod, a silent acknowledgment of the bargain they’d both unknowingly made. <words>333</words>
It was enough. <words>336</words>
The ocean continued to roar. <words>340</words>
The candle flickered. <words>344</words>
And they waited. <words>347</words>
