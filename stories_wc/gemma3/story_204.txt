Old Man Tiber, a professional cuddler of some renown, adjusted his tweed jacket, the fabric showing a gentle decay around the elbows. <words>17</words>
He found himself, unusually usual for a man awaiting the announcement of a lifetime achievement award, at a farmer’s market, seeking peaches. <words>31</words>
It was during the hush before his acceptance speech began – a silence he couldn’t bear to face alone – that he’d impulsively fled the gala. <words>48</words>
That’s where he had a chance encounter with Elara, a woman selling hand-carved wooden birds, her eyes holding the weight of forgotten constellations. <words>66</words>
She noticed the small, tarnished object clutched in his hand: a phantom train ticket punch, a relic from a time when journeys felt…different. <words>83</words>
“My grandfather used to work the lines,” she said, her voice like wind chimes, “before the spaceport shut down.” <words>98</words>
Tiber confessed he’d found it in the abandoned spaceport hangar, a place steeped in ancient novelty and the scent of rusting metal. <words>116</words>
He’d always held a deep-seated prejudice against ‘Skyfarers,’ those who’d abandoned Earth for the colonies, deeming them cold and unfeeling. <words>135</words>
His profession, offering comfort through touch, felt like a direct rebuke to their perceived emotional detachment. <words>150</words>
Elara explained her grandfather had been a stationmaster, witnessing countless departures, enforcing the unspoken rules of interstellar travel. <words>168</words>
“He said the punch wasn’t for validating tickets,” she revealed, “but for marking a moment of letting go, a silent blessing for the journey.” <words>189</words>
Tiber realized his prejudice had blinded him to the shared human experience of loss and longing, regardless of where one called home. <words>208</words>
The hangar, he understood, wasn’t a monument to abandonment, but a testament to the courage to seek something more. <words>225</words>
He’d been so focused on the *absence* of touch among the Skyfarers, he’d failed to see the universal need for connection. <words>242</words>
The decay of the spaceport mirrored his own decaying assumptions, crumbling under the weight of a new perspective. <words>258</words>
Elara smiled, handing him a perfect peach. <words>264</words>
“Sometimes,” she said, “the most important journeys aren’t about where you go, but what you leave behind.” <words>281</words>
He understood then that overcoming prejudice wasn’t about changing others, but about dismantling the walls within himself. <words>298</words>
Returning to the gala, he felt a lightness he hadn’t known before, ready to deliver a speech not about his achievements, but about empathy. <words>317</words>
The phantom punch, warm in his pocket, was a reminder that even in the vastness of space, the human heart remained the same. <words>335</words>
He ascended the stage, the unspoken rules of kindness now guiding his words, a testament to a chance encounter and a decaying prejudice. <words>353</words>
The ancient novelty of human connection, he realized, was eternally, unusually usual. <words>368</words>
