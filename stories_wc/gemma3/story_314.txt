Old Man Tiber, a policy enforcer for the Unified Harmony, hadn’t felt genuine emotion in decades, a fact he found genuinely fake, considering his job was to *ensure* emotional stability in others. <30> He sat in the kelp forest observation post, a bubble of reinforced glass clinging to a towering strand of golden kelp, the rhythmic pulse of the ocean mirroring the ache in his temples. <54> His current assignment: monitoring the Veil, the shimmering boundary between their perfect utopia and…everything else. <73> It was at this exact second, when young lovers swore their life-long promises beneath the bioluminescent coral gardens, that the Veil thinned. <96> And tonight, it was *thin*. <99>

Tiber’s hand instinctively went to the rustic bread box on the console, a relic from the “Before Times,” utterly illogical in a world of nutrient paste, but a gift from his grandmother – a woman he barely remembered, yet whose memory felt…important. <132> He wasn’t supposed to have personal items, but no one checked much anymore; the Harmony was *too* harmonious. <148> A distortion flickered across the sensors, not a breach, but a…greeting. <156> Something was trying to come through, not with force, but with invitation. <168>

He knew what to do, a forgotten protocol resurfacing with unsettling clarity. <178> He had to guide it, not fight it, and he had to do it with the rhythm of a drum in a tribal dance, a practice outlawed for its “destabilizing influence.” <203> Tiber began to tap a slow, deliberate beat on the bread box, the hollow wood resonating with a primal energy he hadn’t known he possessed. <226> The distortion coalesced into a being of pure shadow, its form shifting and swirling like smoke. <241> 

Tiber laughed, tears streaming down his face – actual, honest-to-goodness tears. <256> He hadn’t realized how much he’d missed fear, the sharp, clarifying sting of the unknown. <272> He understood now; his motivation wasn’t to *prevent* breaches, but to greet fear as a necessary teacher, a reminder that perfection was stagnation. <294> The shadow being pulsed with the rhythm, responding to his guidance, and then, with a final, graceful swirl, it retreated, leaving only the shimmering Veil and the echoing beat of the bread box. <320> Tiber continued drumming, a single, genuine smile gracing his lips. <330> The Harmony might not understand, but he finally did. <338> He was, after all, a policy enforcer, and this was his new policy. <349>
