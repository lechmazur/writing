Old Man Tiber, the surly watchman of the sailor’s graveyard, adjusted his oilskin coat against the chill between seasons. <words>13</words>
He wasn’t guarding against grave robbers, but against…loss, a feeling as pervasive as the sea mist clinging to the weathered headstones. <words>26</words>
Tiber’s motivation wasn’t piety, but a desperate need to understand cosmic patterns, believing the departed held keys to the universe’s rhythm. <words>41</words>
He’d learned the art of knot-reading – a traditional craft passed down from his grandmother, a woman who’d charted fortunes in tangled twine – hoping to decipher those patterns. <words>59</words>
Today, a young woman, Elara, approached, her movements serenely frantic, clutching a short piece of yarn, faded blue like a forgotten wave. <words>76</words>
“They say you ask the stones questions,” she said, her voice barely a whisper, “and they answer through…things.” <words>92</words>
Tiber grunted, accepting the yarn. “I ask riddles, girl. The stones don’t speak, but the weave remembers.” <words>107</words>
He held the yarn, its texture rough against his calloused fingers, and began to knot it, not with intention, but with a practiced flow, guided by the graveyard’s energy. <words>126</words>
“What is lost at sea, yet found in the heart?” he murmured, the riddle forming as the knots tightened. <words>141</words>
Elara’s eyes widened. “My brother…he was a fisherman. Lost to a storm last autumn.” <words>156</words>
Tiber continued knotting, the yarn becoming a miniature map of swirling currents and hidden depths. <words>170</words>
“Market wisdom tells us loss isn’t absence, but transformation,” he rasped, his tone surprisingly gentle despite his gruff exterior. <words>187</words>
“The sea takes, but it also gives back – in memories, in lessons, in the strength to face another dawn.” <words>204</words>
He presented the knotted yarn to Elara. “This isn’t a prediction, child, but a reflection. The knots show not *where* he is, but *how* he lives on.” <words>224</words>
Elara traced the knots with a trembling finger. “It…it feels like him. Restless, but peaceful.” <words>240</words>
Tiber watched her, the dignified chaos of the graveyard settling around them. <words>251</words>
He didn’t claim to understand the cosmos, only to listen to its whispers woven into the fabric of things. <words>267</words>
The yarn, a simple object, had become a conduit, a testament to the enduring power of connection. <words>281</words>
He knew, with a certainty that bypassed logic, that the graveyard wasn’t a place of endings, but of continuations. <words>297</words>
Another soul found a sliver of peace, another pattern acknowledged in the grand, swirling tapestry of existence. <words>313</words>
Tiber turned back to the stones, ready for the next riddle, the next knot, the next whisper from the sea. <words>329</words>
The between-seasons wind carried the scent of salt and the weight of untold stories. <words>343</words>
He was, after all, just a watchman, tending to the echoes of lives lived and lost. <words>357</words>
