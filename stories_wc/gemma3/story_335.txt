Old Man Tiber, they called him, though he wasn’t particularly old, just…shaky, a mercenary whose hands trembled even when still. <words>14</words>
He sat amongst the chipped frescoes and spray-painted saints of the collapsed cathedral, now a haven for street artists and the lost, during the slow fade of an echoing hour. <words>32</words>
Tiber wasn’t here for art, though; he was finalizing a deal, one built on improbable rumor chains that led him to this crumbling sanctuary. <words>49</words>
He’d been following whispers of a collector, a recluse obsessed with the unknown, and the price of admission was…peculiar. <words>66</words>
The collector wanted a chunk of amber, not for its beauty, but for the perfectly preserved spider trapped within, a relic of a forgotten age. <words>84</words>
Tiber held it now, the warm resin cool against his palm, a strange weight considering its size, a physical manifestation of suspended time. <words>103</words>
He was a carefully reckless man, always calculating the odds, but willing to gamble on the impossible if the payout was right – or if it eased the ache. <words>123</words>
That ache was his past, a string of contracts gone wrong, faces he’d failed to protect, a life lived in the shadows. <words>141</words>
This wasn’t about the coin; it was about finding something beyond the grime and regret, a sliver of peace in the vast, indifferent universe. <words>161</words>
The collector, a woman named Lyra, emerged from the shadows, her eyes reflecting the flickering candlelight. <words>177</words>
“You have it,” she breathed, her voice like rustling leaves. <words>187</words>
Tiber nodded, handing over the amber. <words>193</words>
“I heard you seek…answers,” Lyra said, producing a tarnished silver locket. <words>207</words>
“Rumors travel,” Tiber replied, accepting the locket, its metal cold against his skin. <words>221</words>
“Inside,” Lyra continued, “is a map, not to treasure, but to a place where the veil thins, where the unknown whispers loudest.” <words>243</words>
He opened the locket; the map wasn’t ink on parchment, but a constellation of tiny, iridescent scales. <words>259</words>
It was a path to nowhere, and everywhere, a journey into the heart of what he’d spent a lifetime avoiding. <words>276</words>
A flicker of improbable longing ignited within him, a fragile hope blooming in the ruins of his past. <words>292</words>
He would follow it, not for riches, not for glory, but for the chance to finally understand what lay beyond the shadows. <words>308</words>
Perhaps, in searching for the unknown, he could finally find himself. <words>322</words>
The cathedral seemed to hold its breath, waiting with him. <words>331</words>
He adjusted his grip on the locket, a shaky hand steadying with purpose. <words>342</words>
The echoing hour continued its slow fade, but for Tiber, a new journey had begun. <words>356</words>
He walked towards the crumbling archway, a silhouette against the dying light. <words>369</words>
The past wouldn’t disappear, but maybe, just maybe, he could make peace with it. <words>380</words>
