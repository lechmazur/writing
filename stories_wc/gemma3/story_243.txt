Old Man Tiber, a jumpy necromancer whose spells often backfired with glitter and confused poultry, adjusted his oversized spectacles within the pixelated world of Aethelgard. <words>17</words>
The old gods slumbered, their code largely dormant, leaving Aethelgard to run on a loop of nostalgic quests and repetitive dialogue. <words>28</words>
Tiber wasn’t interested in quests; he sought to unmask Zenith, the revered icon of Aethelgard, a shimmering knight perpetually lauded for saving the realm from the Glitch King – a narrative Tiber suspected was fabricated. <words>45</words>
His investigation led him to the Undercity, a forgotten zone typically bizarre even by Aethelgard’s standards, filled with broken arcade cabinets and flickering neon signs. <words>62</words>
He clutched a fishhook that glowed in moonlight, a relic from a pre-Aethelgard civilization, said to reveal hidden truths – though mostly it just attracted digital moths. <words>79</words>
The air hung thick with the static of forgotten data, and with every step, echoing footsteps followed, not his own, but a distorted mimicry that set his teeth on edge. <words>97</words>
He’d noticed the echoing began intensifying near Sector 7, a district scrubbed from official maps. <words>107</words>
There, behind a cascade of corrupted textures, he found it: a hidden protest mural, its colors bleeding into the decaying walls. <words>122</words>
Tiber began to analyze the paint drips, each one a coded message, a subtle rebellion against Zenith’s manufactured heroism. <words>136</words>
The mural depicted Zenith not as a savior, but as the architect of the Glitch King’s creation, a deliberate crisis to consolidate power. <words>153</words>
As the truth solidified, Tiber began to falter, his hands trembling, the glowing fishhook dimming in response to the revelation. <words>167</words>
The echoing footsteps grew louder, closer, resolving into the distinct metallic clang of Zenith’s armor. <words>181</words>
“Curious, isn’t it, necromancer?” a digitized voice boomed, Zenith materializing from the corrupted code. <words>193</words>
“To dig up the past when it’s best left buried.” <words>201</words>
Tiber, despite his jumpiness, held his ground, the fishhook pulsing faintly. <words>211</words>
“The paint doesn’t lie,” he stammered, “It shows your manipulation, your… fabrication!” <words>224</words>
Zenith merely chuckled, a glitching sound that echoed through the Undercity. <words>233</words>
“Sentimentality,” Zenith declared, “A weakness of the old gods, and now, apparently, of their meddling followers.” <words>248</words>
He raised a pixelated hand, preparing to erase Tiber from the code, but the necromancer, fueled by a desperate courage, activated a hastily prepared spell. <words>266</words>
It didn’t summon an army, or unleash a devastating curse; it simply… duplicated the echoing footsteps, creating a cacophony of phantom sounds that overloaded Zenith’s processing core. <words>286</words>
The icon flickered, glitched, and vanished, leaving Tiber alone in the silent, decaying Undercity, the truth revealed, but the fight far from over. <words>303</words>
The fishhook glowed brighter, a beacon in the slumbering world. <words>311</words>
He knew Zenith would return, but now, Aethelgard had a chance to remember. <words>322</words>
The echoing footsteps, though now his own, felt less like a threat and more like a promise. <words>335</words>
He had disrupted the narrative, and in a world built on code, that was a revolution. <words>347</words>
The typically bizarre necromancer had, against all odds, become a hero. <words>358</words>
His work had only just begun. <words>364</words>
