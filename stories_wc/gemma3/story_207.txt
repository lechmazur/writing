Old Man Tiber, a forthright peddler of forgotten comforts, drifted through the echoing corridors of the abandoned space station medical bay, the universe humming its secret song around him. <31> He wasn’t here for salvage, though the station was ripe with it; he was here to break an oath sealed in blood, a promise made to a dying warlord decades ago. <53> Tiber carried a dried flower bouquet, brittle lavender and crimson blooms held together with faded ribbon, a strange offering for such a desolate place. <74> He moved with a meekly assertive grace, ignoring the flickering emergency lights and the ghosts of pain that clung to the sterile walls. <94> 

His task wasn’t physical, but informational – he needed to divide something, not matter, but belief. <108> He’d been sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns salvaged from derelict freighters, searching for the fractured narratives surrounding Lyra, the warlord’s daughter. <133> The oath demanded he protect her reputation, ensure she remained a symbol of righteous fury, but Tiber believed she deserved peace, a chance to be remembered as something other than a weapon. <161> 

He found it, a whisper in a digitized magazine: a former medic claiming Lyra had secretly funded a network of hospitals, diverting war profits to heal the very people her father ravaged. <187> It was a small thing, easily dismissed as propaganda, but Tiber knew it held a kernel of truth. <204> He began subtly amplifying the story, leaking it to independent news feeds, letting it blossom in the digital void. <223> 

The joy he felt wasn’t boisterous, but a quiet warmth, a joyful loneliness blooming in the cold metal of the station. <243> Each shared article, each questioning comment, was a petal unfurling on Lyra’s new image. <258> He placed the dried flower bouquet on a rusted examination table, a silent offering to the possibility of a different future. <277> The oath felt lighter with each passing hour, the blood-seal weakening. <291> He wasn’t erasing the past, but adding to it, offering a counter-narrative, a path to redemption for a woman he’d never met. <313> It wasn’t about forgiveness, but about complexity, about allowing a life to be more than a single, brutal story. <331> As the universe continued its song, Tiber knew he’d done all he could, and a fragile peace settled over the abandoned medical bay. <350> He turned to leave, a peddler of hope in a graveyard of despair. <364>
