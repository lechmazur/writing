Old Man Tiber, a proud exorcist with a reputation for theatrics, adjusted his spectacles, peering down at the sprawling treehouse city of Aethel, nestled deep within the Amazon rainforest. <30>
He’d received a frantic message – a temporal anomaly, a moment when the clock dared to skip a beat, causing… complications. <46>
Tiber wasn’t thrilled; he preferred dramatic possessions to fiddly time-warps, but the shadow of his predecessor, the legendary Elias Thorne, loomed large, and Tiber was determined to outshine him. <69>
He clutched a wizard’s battered grimoire, its leather cracked and pages brittle, a relic Thorne himself had used, and frankly, Tiber suspected, deliberately left in a state of disrepair to test his successor. <95>
The anomaly centered around Old Man Hemlock, Aethel’s resident herbalist, who was…youthifying, rapidly reverting to boyhood. <112>
“Endearingly feisty, that one,” Tiber muttered, recalling Hemlock’s sharp tongue and even sharper remedies. <127>
The usual path to reversing such a spell – a complex ritual involving moonpetal dust and hummingbird song – was suddenly, inexplicably blocked by a wall of thorny vines, a sudden closure of a usual path. <151>
Tiber sighed, flipping through the grimoire; Thorne had always favored unconventional solutions. <164>
He found it – a counter-spell, ridiculously simple, requiring only a focused intention and a touch. <178>
But the grimoire warned of a cost: a portion of the caster’s own life force, transferred to stabilize the timeline. <197>
The weight of responsibility settled on Tiber’s shoulders, heavier than any demon he’d ever banished. <212>
He could ignore it, let Hemlock become a child, and avoid the personal sacrifice, but Thorne’s shadow would stretch even longer. <232>
With a playful cynicism, Tiber approached the rapidly shrinking Hemlock, now barely taller than a macaw. <248>
He placed a hand on the boy’s head, focusing his intent, channeling his energy into the spell. <263>
A wave of exhaustion washed over him, but Hemlock began to age in reverse, slowing, then stabilizing, returning to his grumpy, elderly self. <284>
“Honestly,” Hemlock grumbled, adjusting his spectacles, “the theatrics.” <293>
Tiber, leaning heavily on his staff, managed a weak smile; perhaps he hadn’t outshone Thorne, but he’d faced the weight, and that, he realized, was enough. <314>
The grimoire felt a little lighter in his hands. <321>
He had a feeling Aethel, and the Amazon, would continue to offer complications. <333>
And Tiber, despite his grumbling, would be ready. <341>
He was, after all, a proud exorcist. <348>
The clock ticked on, steady once more. <355>
A new challenge awaited, hidden within the emerald canopy. <365>
Tiber adjusted his spectacles again, a flicker of anticipation in his eyes. <375>
