Old Man Tiber, a groggy brewer more accustomed to the scent of hops than hauntings, squinted at the chipped stone of Blackwood Manor’s graveyard. <words>17</words>
The lull in the protest – a surprisingly polite disagreement about garden gnomes – allowed the distant murmur of voices to gather again, a rhythmic pulse against the oppressive silence of the estate. <words>33</words>
He’d been drawn here not by any grand purpose, but by a uniquely generic feeling of… obligation, a desire to become a living embodiment of the quiet decency he preached over pints. <words>52</words>
Tiber wasn’t a ghost hunter, or a hero, just a man who believed in things being *right*, and Blackwood Manor felt profoundly, unsettlingly wrong. <words>69</words>
He’d heard whispers of the encroaching darkness, a slow rot that wasn’t merely decay, but a deliberate snuffing out of light and memory. <words>86</words>
It began, he discovered, not with a spectral wail or rattling chains, but with the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase within the mansion. <words>105</words>
A smudge of grey, almost imperceptible, marring the otherwise uniform stone. <words>112</words>
Tiber, feeling compelled to initiate *something*, anything, began to climb, each step echoing with a hollow finality. <words>128</words>
He carried only a small, tarnished silver locket and a piece of a broken mirror, salvaged from the manor’s wreckage years ago – a memento of a kindness repaid. <words>148</words>
The discoloration grew with each ascending turn, spreading like a bruise, and the air thickened with a cold that seeped into his bones. <words>166</words>
He found the source: a portrait, its canvas subtly shifting, the subject’s eyes losing their light, replaced by a void that seemed to pull at his own soul. <words>187</words>
Tiber, with a flippant solemnity born of years spent observing human folly, held up the mirror shard. <words>203</words>
It didn’t reflect his face, but a swirling vortex of grey, mirroring the stain on the stairs, the emptiness in the portrait’s eyes. <words>223</words>
He understood then: the darkness wasn’t an external force, but a reflection of lost values, of forgotten kindnesses. <words>241</words>
Opening the locket, he focused on the tiny, faded photograph within – a smiling woman offering a loaf of bread. <words>258</words>
He projected that image, that simple act of generosity, into the mirror shard, willing it to counteract the encroaching void. <words>276</words>
The grey recoiled, the portrait flickered, and a faint warmth returned to the air. <words>289</words>
It wasn’t a victory, not exactly, but a holding action, a small beacon against the tide. <words>305</words>
The voices from the protest swelled again, closer now, and Tiber knew his work wasn’t done. <words>318</words>
He descended the staircase, the discoloration lessened, a groggy brewer armed with a shard of glass and a stubborn belief in decency. <words>337</words>
The encroaching darkness hadn’t been defeated, merely… reminded of what it was forgetting. <words>352</words>
And sometimes, Tiber thought, that was enough to initiate change. <words>363</words>
He had a feeling he’d be brewing a very special batch of ale tonight. <words>370</words>
