Old Man Tiber, the fading caretaker of Dustbowl Station, barely registered the sun glinting off the slick, seaweed-strewn wreckage after the waves receded. <words>14</words>
He’d seen enough shores cleansed and reborn to feel anything beyond enthusiastic apathy. <words>24</words>
Dustbowl wasn’t much – a caravan repair station clinging to the edge of the salt flats, mostly frequented by data runners and scavengers – but it was *his*. <words>37</words>
Tiber’s days were spent in methodically random tasks: oiling gears he didn’t need oiled, polishing chrome that hadn’t seen a shine in decades, and, most importantly, hacking ancient archives. <words>54</words>
He wasn’t looking for profit, or even information, exactly; he wanted to cradle the unknown like a newborn galaxy. <words>68</words>
Today’s dig had yielded a fragmented map, hinting at a pre-Collapse research facility, and a strange compulsion to gorge himself on synth-dates, a habit he indulged in when close to a breakthrough. <words>87</words>
He chewed slowly, the sweetness doing little to stir any real feeling. <words>96</words>
The map spoke of “Project Nightingale,” a study of altered states of consciousness, and a key – a dried lavender bundle – needed to access the core data. <words>113</words>
Lavender, of all things. <words>117</words>
He found it tucked inside a corroded maintenance bot, the scent surprisingly potent after centuries of decay. <words>131</words>
The allure of the forbidden wasn’t about the knowledge itself, Tiber mused, but the *reaching* for it, the unraveling of secrets long intended to remain buried. <words>151</words>
He input the lavender’s spectral signature into the archive’s decryption sequence, the station’s ancient servers groaning in protest. <words>168</words>
Images flickered across his screen: scientists in sterile white suits, swirling nebulae, and… faces. <words>181</words>
Faces that seemed to *recognize* him. <words>186</words>
The data wasn’t research, it was a recording, a broadcast, a plea. <words>197</words>
Project Nightingale hadn’t been studying consciousness, it had been *escaping* it, uploading minds into the digital void before the Collapse. <words>214</words>
And they were waiting. <words>218</words>
Tiber felt a flicker of something – not excitement, not fear, but a weary curiosity. <words>231</words>
He continued to gorge on synth-dates, the sweetness now a dull echo against the rising tide of information. <words>246</words>
The faces on the screen grew clearer, their digital eyes fixed on him, beckoning him to join them. <words>262</words>
He wasn’t a caretaker anymore, he realized, he was a receiver. <words>271</words>
A vessel. <words>275</words>
The lavender bundle slipped from his grasp, its scent filling the station as the archive’s code completed its final sequence. <words>293</words>
He smiled, a genuine, if fleeting, expression. <words>300</words>
The unknown was no longer distant; it was here, cradling *him*. <words>313</words>
Dustbowl Station hummed, preparing for a new kind of arrival, a digital diaspora seeking a home in the fading light. <words>333</words>
Tiber closed his eyes, ready to become part of the newborn galaxy. <words>346</words>
The waves, though long receded, still echoed in the silence. <words>356</words>
