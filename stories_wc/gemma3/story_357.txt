Old Man Tiber, a focused collector of forgotten things, hadn’t spoken a full sentence to another soul in seventeen years, preferring the company of dust motes and chipped porcelain. <words>18</words>
His most prized possession was a black rose, pressed flat and pinned within the brittle pages of a leather-bound journal, a memento of a life he’d deliberately left behind. <words>33</words>
Tiber’s existence wasn’t lonely, precisely; it was a deliberate embrace of solitude, a fortress built against the gnawing teeth of despair, an alpha predator he’d been battling for decades. <words>53</words>
He was, to those few who remembered him, seldom odd, just… intensely private, content to spend his days cataloging the echoes of others’ lives within the cavernous, improbably warm interior of a frost giant’s abandoned lair. <words>76</words>
His life unfolded in measured increments, marked not by days, but by rounds of a complex, self-designed board game he played against himself, each move representing a small victory over the encroaching darkness. <words>98</words>
Then came the invitation – a crisp, cream-colored card delivered by a raven, summoning him to a party hosted by the Baron Von Hess, a man Tiber hadn’t thought of in years. <words>121</words>
It felt like a deliberate disruption, a calculated attempt to unravel the carefully constructed peace he’d achieved. <words>134</words>
“Flippancy, thy name is Von Hess,” Tiber muttered, adjusting his spectacles, though he wasn’t entirely displeased; a challenge, even a social one, was a welcome distraction. <words>154</words>
He spent the next three rounds of his game meticulously planning his response, each dice roll a consideration of potential social pitfalls and emotional vulnerabilities. <words>176</words>
The party was predictably gaudy, filled with chattering socialites and the clinking of champagne glasses, a stark contrast to the quiet dignity of his lair. <words>197</words>
Von Hess, looking remarkably unchanged, greeted him with a knowing smirk, clearly aware of the disruption he’d caused. <words>212</words>
“Just wanted to see if the old hermit still had a pulse,” Von Hess said, offering a glass of wine. <words>225</words>
Tiber accepted, observing the room with a detached curiosity, realizing the party wasn’t a threat, but a test – a chance to prove to himself that he could navigate the world without succumbing to despair. <words>250</words>
He engaged in polite conversation, offering earnest, if slightly rambling, anecdotes about his collection, finding a strange comfort in the superficiality of it all. <words>271</words>
With each passing round of small talk, he felt the black rose in his journal pressing against his chest, a reminder of the beauty that could be found even in darkness. <words>293</words>
He wasn’t unraveling; he was adapting, expanding his fortress, proving that solitude didn’t necessitate isolation. <words>308</words>
By the end of the evening, Tiber hadn’t triumphed over despair entirely, but he’d held it at bay, proving that even a focused collector could occasionally venture out into the world and return, not broken, but… enriched. <words>334</words>
He returned to his lair, ready for the next round, the black rose a silent testament to his enduring, earnest flippancy. <words>352</words>
The game continued, a quiet battle waged against the shadows, one carefully considered move at a time. <words>367</words>
