Old Man Tiber, a minstrel whose skepticism was as renowned as his ballads were forgettable, checked his pocket watch at the hush of an empty mailbox at midday. <words>17</words>
He was waiting for Barnaby Finch, an immortal trickster with a penchant for pilfered memories and impossibly plausible lies. <words>28</words>
Tiber wasn’t after his memories, though; he wanted to *beat* Finch, a feat no one had managed in centuries, and he intended to do it with reckless generosity. <words>42</words>
His plan hinged on a single, tarnished scrap of dragon-scale armor, acquired from a surprisingly honest goblin merchant. <words>54</words>
The factory behind him, once a bustling disappearing ink factory, now stood silent, its windows like vacant eyes. <words>66</words>
Tiber knew Finch would arrive seeking a trade – a story for a secret, a laugh for a lost skill – and Tiber had just the thing. <words>79</words>
He’d learned Finch couldn’t resist a good deal, especially one that seemed to benefit him immensely, a weakness born of endless boredom. <words>93</words>
A plume of steam hissed from an ancient vent near the factory’s loading dock, a signal Tiber had rigged to coincide with Finch’s arrival. <words>107</words>
Finch materialized with a flourish, smelling faintly of cinnamon and regret. <words>116</words>
“Tiber, my dear fellow! I hear you’ve something…interesting?” he purred, his eyes already scanning for vulnerabilities. <words>129</words>
Tiber held up the dragon scale. “A piece of true protection, Finch. Impervious to magic, blade, even time itself.” <words>143</words>
Finch scoffed. “Impossibly plausible, even for you, Tiber.” <words>151</words>
“But I’m feeling…generous,” Tiber said with a grin. “I’ll trade it for a single, insignificant memory of *your* choosing.” <words>166</words>
Finch’s eyes narrowed. The reckless generosity was the bait. He couldn’t fathom why anyone would part with such an item for so little. <words>181</words>
He agreed, selecting a memory of a particularly embarrassing failed illusion. <words>190</words>
As Finch reached for the scale, Tiber, with a practiced flick of the wrist, launched a pebble with his slingshot, aiming for the steam vent. <words>206</words>
The vent erupted, releasing a concentrated burst of the factory’s disappearing ink formula, coating Finch in a shimmering mist. <words>222</words>
The memory Finch had given Tiber wasn’t insignificant; it was the key to maintaining his physical form. <words>235</words>
As the ink took effect, Finch began to fade, sputtering in disbelief. <words>244</words>
“You…you tricked me!” he gasped, becoming translucent. <words>252</words>
“Reckless generosity, Finch,” Tiber said, adjusting his lute. “Sometimes, the best way to win is to let your opponent think they’ve won bigger.” <words>270</words>
Finch vanished completely, leaving only the scent of cinnamon and a lingering sense of irreverent awe. <words>284</words>
Tiber chuckled, pocketing the memory and the satisfaction of finally out-scheming an immortal. <words>296</words>
He had a ballad to write, though he doubted anyone would remember it. <words>307</words>
The dragon scale, he decided, would look rather dashing on his lute. <words>317</words>
It was a small reward for a victory centuries in the making, a testament to the power of a skeptical minstrel and a well-aimed slingshot. <words>335</words>
He strolled away, leaving the silent factory and the empty mailbox behind, a quiet triumph in the midday sun. <words>351</words>
