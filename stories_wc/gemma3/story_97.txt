Old Man Tiber, a fact-minded oracle with a desperately casual air, adjusted his spectacles, the unstable dimension shimmering around him like heat haze. <words>17</words>
He held a tarnished brass compass, its needle spinning wildly, not towards north, but towards echoes of feeling. <words>28</words>
Tiber wasn’t seeking geographical locations; he was motivated to find forgotten places *within* people, the chambers sealed off by trauma and indifference. <words>43</words>
It was, he believed, the only path to empathy, a concept rapidly eroding in this fractured reality. <words>56</words>
“Right then,” he murmured, recomposing himself after a particularly jarring vision – a child’s lost balloon, a lover’s final glance – the source of his predictive ability. <words>73</words>
His visions weren’t prophecies, but bleed-throughs, heartbreak-induced glimpses into the emotional landscapes of others. <words>87</words>
He existed in the cradle of a whispered minute, a temporal anomaly where past, present, and potential futures blurred. <words>102</words>
The compass pulsed, leading him towards a swirling vortex of lavender and grey, a manifestation of a woman named Elara’s grief. <words>118</words>
Elara had walled off her capacity for connection after losing her brother, and Tiber felt the dimension itself weakening because of it. <words>134</words>
“Optimistic desperation, that’s the key,” he muttered, though it sounded more like a sigh. <words>145</words>
He stepped into the vortex, the compass growing warm in his hand, and found himself not in a place, but *inside* Elara’s memory of their last argument. <words>164</words>
He didn’t interfere, didn’t offer advice; he simply *witnessed* the raw, aching vulnerability beneath her anger. <words>178</words>
The compass spun slower, then stilled, pointing not outwards, but inwards, towards Elara’s own heart. <words>192</words>
He saw a flicker of recognition in her spectral form, a softening of the rigid lines around her eyes. <words>206</words>
The dimension around them stabilized, the lavender and grey resolving into a gentle, hopeful blue. <words>221</words>
Tiber knew he hadn’t *fixed* Elara, but he’d cracked the wall, allowing a sliver of light to enter. <words>236</words>
That was enough. <words>239</words>
He’d seen countless heartbreak-induced visions, each one a painful step towards a more connected world. <words>256</words>
The brass compass, his constant companion, was a reminder that even in the most fractured realities, empathy was a direction worth following. <words>274</words>
He recomposed himself again, bracing for the next echo, the next forgotten place, the next desperate hope. <words>290</words>
Another pulse from the compass, fainter this time, beckoned him onward. <words>302</words>
There was always another heart to find, another wall to gently nudge. <words>315</words>
He adjusted his spectacles, a small, optimistic smile playing on his lips, and stepped forward, into the swirling chaos. <words>333</words>
The path wasn’t easy, but it was the only one that mattered. <words>345</words>
He continued his search, a fact-minded oracle driven by a desperately casual hope, one heartbreak-induced vision at a time. <words>364</words>
The compass guided him, a beacon in the unstable dimension, towards the forgotten places within us all. <words>381</words>
