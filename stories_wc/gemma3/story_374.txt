Old Man Tiber, a lonesome minstrel with a voice like worn velvet, perched on the rusted railing of the rooftop horse stables, a bizarrely typical sight in Neo-Veridia. <words>18</words>
Below, the metropolis hummed with automated traffic and the endless, snaking coffee lines that fueled its citizens. <words>30</words>
He wasn’t interested in caffeine, though; Tiber was attempting to read the silent cosmos, interpreting prophecies in the shifting cloud patterns above. <words>46</words>
His family had done so for generations, a tradition fiercely opposed by the Bellwethers, a clan of data-analysts who preferred algorithms to atmosphere. <words>64</words>
This inherited rivalry was less about grand conflict and more about a constant, low-level annoyance, a perpetual bickering over the ‘true’ way to predict the future. <words>83</words>
Today’s argument, initiated by a Bellwether drone buzzing too close, was particularly irritating. <words>94</words>
“Honestly,” Tiber muttered, adjusting his spectacles, “they think a spreadsheet can capture the soul of a cumulus.” <words>108</words>
He pulled a small, tarnished box from his satchel, opening it to reveal a rubber stamp, its image unclear, worn smooth with age. <words>125</words>
It was a family heirloom, used to ‘seal’ his predictions, a symbolic gesture the Bellwethers mocked relentlessly. <words>139</words>
“Predicting rain with *stamps*,” he mimicked in a high-pitched voice, then resumed tracking a particularly turbulent formation. <words>156</words>
The drone’s synthesized voice crackled, “Cloud formations are statistically insignificant, Tiber. Your methods are… quaint.” <words>171</words>
“Quaint?” Tiber scoffed, carefully aligning the blurry stamp over his notepad. <words>181</words>
“It’s a lineage, a connection to something older than your precious data streams!” <words>193</words>
He pressed the stamp, the unclear image leaving a faint impression on the page. <words>203</words>
“Besides,” he added, glancing at the lengthening coffee lines below, “people need a little enchantment in their mundane lives.” <words>220</words>
The drone sputtered, momentarily silenced by the unexpected philosophical retort. <words>231</words>
Tiber smiled, a small, private victory amidst the metallic landscape. <words>241</words>
He continued to watch the clouds, the stamp a comforting weight in his hand, the bickering a familiar rhythm. <words>258</words>
The Bellwethers would never understand, and that, he realized, was perfectly alright. <words>270</words>
The cosmos didn’t need understanding, only observation, and perhaps, a little bit of a blurry, inherited stamp. <words>288</words>
Another cloud shifted, and Tiber began to decipher its silent message, lost in the mundane enchantment of a rooftop world. <words>305</words>
He knew, with a certainty that bypassed logic, that rain was coming, and the coffee lines would grow even longer. <words>322</words>
The drone, recovering, began to recalculate, its algorithms failing to account for the poetry of the sky. <words>338</words>
Tiber chuckled softly, a lonesome sound carried on the wind, sealing another prediction with the weight of generations. <words>355</words>
The unclear image on the page felt, somehow, profoundly clear. <words>366</words>
He was a minstrel, a cloud-reader, and a keeper of a bizarrely typical, beautifully stubborn tradition. <words>380</words>
