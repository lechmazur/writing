Old Man Tiber, the patient librarian of Aethelburg, moved with a hyperactively serene grace, even as his knuckles throbbed with a phantom ache. <words>17</words>
He wasn’t cataloging books today, but arranging place settings in the grand, steampunk dining hall, gears whirring softly in the chandeliers above. <words>31</words>
It was a peculiar task for a librarian, but Tiber had insisted; he needed the meticulous order, the echoing space, for a ritual of sorts, in the hush of a memory reclaimed. <words>49</words>
He was preparing for the annual Founder’s Day feast, a celebration he’d once loathed, a celebration dedicated to Lord Harrington, the man he’d vowed to bury an old hatred towards. <words>68</words>
Years ago, Harrington had stolen Tiber’s research, claiming it as his own, effectively ending Tiber’s academic career. <words>83</words>
Now, Harrington was dead, but the sting remained, a dull, persistent burn. <words>92</words>
Tiber carefully placed a silver fork beside a porcelain plate, then retrieved a wrinkled sticker sheet from his coat pocket. <words>107</words>
These weren’t just any stickers; they were labels for forgotten mixtapes, each one a carefully curated collection of songs meant for Elara, Harrington’s wife, with whom Tiber had once shared a quiet, forbidden affection. <words>128</words>
He’d sent her the tapes anonymously, pouring his heart into the music, a subtle rebellion against her husband’s arrogance. <words>142</words>
Elara had never acknowledged them, and Tiber suspected Harrington knew, fueling his cruelty. <words>154</words>
Tonight, Tiber would play the mixtapes, subtly, through the dining hall’s sound system, a final, insignificant act of defiance. <words>169</words>
He wasn’t seeking recognition, or even satisfaction; he understood the hollow victory of posthumous revenge. <words>184</words>
Harrington wouldn’t hear it, wouldn’t care, but the act itself was a release, a way to finally lay the past to rest. <words>200</words>
As the first guests arrived, Tiber activated the system, the faint strains of a melancholic waltz filling the hall. <words>215</words>
He watched, impassive, as people began to dine, oblivious to the hidden message woven into the music. <words>228</words>
The gears continued to turn, the chandeliers to gleam, and Tiber, the patient librarian, found a strange peace in the quiet throb of his fading resentment. <words>246</words>
It wasn’t a triumph, not exactly, but a letting go, a severing of the cord that had bound him to Harrington for decades. <words>263</words>
He’d spent years crafting this moment, not for glory, but for the simple act of erasure. <words>276</words>
The stickers, faded and worn, were a testament to a love unrequited and a hatred finally, quietly, extinguished. <words>292</words>
The feast continued, a lavish display of Aethelburg’s prosperity, built, in part, on the stolen dreams of a patient librarian. <words>308</words>
Tiber smiled, a small, savage grace playing on his lips; the music swelled, a bittersweet symphony of forgotten affections and a hollow victory won. <words>326</words>
He adjusted a napkin, his work complete, the past finally, irrevocably, silent. <words>338</words>
