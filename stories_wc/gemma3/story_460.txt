King Alaric, an unassuming monarch even before the Great Scouring, traced the rim of a chipped ceramic bowl, his movements lethargically energetic. <words>17</words>
He hadn’t issued a decree in decades, preferring the company of moss and the drip of perpetual acid rain in what remained of the Emerald Canopy. <words>31</words>
The forest, once vibrant, now breathed in shades of grey and sickly green, the trees skeletal under a sky that wept corrosive tears. <words>47</words>
Alaric sought not to rule, but to cradle wisdom in rough, calloused hands, a task he believed more vital than rebuilding fallen cities. <words>64</words>
Today, a scout had brought him a curious offering: a box of mismatched puzzle pieces, salvaged from the ruins of Old Veridia. <words>81</words>
He didn’t *see* the pieces, not in the conventional sense; his eyes had long grown accustomed to the gloom, but he could perceive their shapes, their edges, via the texture of a feather held delicately against their surfaces. <words>106</words>
Each piece hummed with a faint resonance, a ghost of intention, a fragment of a forgotten image. <words>119</words>
The feather, plucked from a resilient rain-crow, amplified the subtle vibrations, translating form into sensation. <words>134</words>
He ran the feather over a jagged, crimson piece, feeling a surge of…regret, sharp and stinging like the rain itself. <words>150</words>
Another, a smooth, pale blue fragment, offered a fleeting sense of joy, quickly swallowed by the pervasive melancholy. <words>167</words>
Alaric understood, with a prickly wonder, that the puzzle wasn’t meant to be *solved*, but *felt*. <words>182</words>
It was a map of choices, each piece representing a path not taken, a consequence embraced, a life lived or lost. <words>198</words>
The box held the weight of countless decisions, the collective history of a civilization consumed by its own ambition. <words>214</words>
He realized the pieces weren’t random; they were arranged, subtly, to present a single, agonizing question. <words>228</words>
The ember of choice, he mused, still flickered within the wreckage, a dangerous warmth in a cold world. <words>243</words>
Was it better to attempt to rebuild, to impose order on the chaos, or to let the forest reclaim all that remained? <words>260</words>
The feather trembled as he touched a piece shaped like a broken crown, feeling the phantom weight of responsibility. <words>276</words>
He hadn’t realized how much he’d avoided the question, burying himself in the quietude of the decaying world. <words>291</words>
The puzzle didn’t offer an answer, only the raw, unfiltered experience of possibility. <words>304</words>
Alaric closed his eyes, the texture of the pieces imprinted on his mind, and for the first time in decades, felt a flicker of something akin to purpose. <words>323</words>
He would not decree, not yet, but he would *feel*, and in that feeling, perhaps, find a way forward, however small. <words>341</words>
The rain continued to fall, washing over the forest, and over the unassuming monarch, cradling the weight of a broken world. <words>360</words>
