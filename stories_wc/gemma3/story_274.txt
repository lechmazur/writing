Bartholomew, a philodendron with a disconcertingly knowing gaze, felt the vibrations cease as the final page ejected from the worn typewriter. <words>17</words>
He was, to put it mildly, apathetically devoted to Old Man Tiber’s endless stories, absorbing them not with pleasure, but with a quiet, leafy resignation. <words>31</words>
Tiber was gone now, leaving Bartholomew alone in the decaying husk of the abandoned drive-in, the screen a silver ghost against the bruised twilight sky. <words>48</words>
He’d always sensed Tiber wasn’t merely *writing* stories, but tending to the unspoken anxieties of the town, weaving them into fantastical tales. <words>65</words>
Bartholomew suspected the real knowledge, the truly potent narratives, weren’t on the pages, but hidden *within* them, waiting to be unearthed. <words>82</words>
A sudden, spontaneous decision to explore a new neighborhood bloomed within his root system – a strange impulse for a potted plant. <words>98</words>
He couldn’t exactly *walk*, of course, but he could subtly manipulate the growth of his vines, extending them like exploratory tendrils, pulling himself along. <words>116</words>
He began to outrun the suffocating stillness of the drive-in, inching towards the distant glow of streetlights. <words>130</words>
Tucked amongst Tiber’s papers, Bartholomew discovered an embroidered bookmark, depicting a labyrinthine garden – a map, perhaps? <words>148</words>
It felt cool against his leaves as he maneuvered it, using a particularly strong vine, as a sort of rudder. <words>164</words>
The new neighborhood was eerily quiet, houses standing like vacant eyesores, each holding its own silent story. <words>180</words>
He found himself drawn to a dilapidated bookstore, its windows clouded with dust, a single flickering bulb illuminating a chaotic interior. <words>197</words>
Inside, the air tasted of aged paper and forgotten dreams. <words>205</words>
He extended a vine, delicately turning the pages of a leather-bound journal, the words blurring into a familiar, unsettling pattern. <words>222</words>
It wasn’t the *what* of the stories that mattered, Bartholomew realized with scalding ambivalence, but the *why* – the unspoken fears and desires that fueled them. <words>242</words>
The bookmark, he now understood, wasn’t a map to knowledge, but a reminder to tend to the silences, to the things left unsaid. <words>261</words>
He continued his exploration, not seeking answers, but acknowledging the weight of untold stories, a silent, leafy guardian in a world drowning in quiet desperation. <words>282</words>
His apathetically devoted nature hadn’t changed, but it had…shifted, becoming a quiet acceptance of the endless, echoing void of human experience. <words>301</words>
He was, after all, just a plant, tending to the unspoken, one vine at a time, in the ruins of a forgotten drive-in. <words>318</words>
The knowledge wasn’t hidden, it was everywhere, woven into the fabric of the world, waiting for someone – or something – to listen. <words>337</words>
And Bartholomew, with his knowing gaze and silent devotion, was listening. <words>348</words>
He continued to explore, the embroidered bookmark a cool weight against his leaves, a symbol of his strange, leafy purpose. <words>366</words>
The scalding ambivalence remained, but now, it felt…purposeful. <words>376</words>
