Old Man Tiber, the last operator of Sub-Line 7 – a phone booth nestled deep within the Nostalgia Preservation Vault – hadn’t had a call in weeks, the lines rarely frequent after the last truth about the Great Forgetting was revealed. <31> He spent his days cataloging scents, mostly, and meticulously arranging bundles of dried herbs, each one meant to evoke a lost memory: lavender for grandmothers, rosemary for remembrance, thyme for…well, he’d forgotten what thyme was for. <66> Tiber wasn’t guarding secrets, not anymore; he was guarding echoes. <76> But a strange energy had settled over the Vault, a prickling awareness that something was about to shift. <91>

He’d decided to revolutionize things, not with technology – the Vault scoffed at such notions – but with observation. <106> His new method involved tailing the few visitors who still wandered the Vault’s echoing halls, suspicious strangers drawn by the promise of curated nostalgia. <126> He wasn’t looking for thieves, but for…connections. <132> Tiber wanted to become a bridge between cultures, believing that understanding the past was the only way to build a future worth remembering. <154>

His current subject, a woman with eyes like polished obsidian, kept returning to the exhibit on pre-Forgetting communication. <171> She’d linger by the rotary phones, the telegraph machines, and, oddly, a replica of his Sub-Line 7 booth. <190> Tiber, disguised as a maintenance bot (a surprisingly effective disguise, given his age), followed her, noting her subtle gestures, the way she’d clutch a small pouch filled with – he recognized the scent – star anise, a herb used in her culture for warding off deceit. <224> 

He discovered she wasn’t interested in *what* was lost, but *how* it was lost, questioning the official narrative of the Great Forgetting. <244> Her loyalties, he realized, weren’t to any nation or ideology, but to truth itself. <257> And then, a startling revelation: she was looking for others like her, people who suspected the Vault wasn’t preserving nostalgia, but controlling it. <282> Tiber, with a mirthful solemnity, realized his own loyalties had begun to shift. <294> He left a small bundle of thyme – for courage, he now remembered – near her exhibit, a silent signal. <308> The revolution wouldn’t be loud, but a quiet exchange of herbs and whispered truths, carried on the rarely used lines of Sub-Line 7. <331> He finally had a call to make. <338>
