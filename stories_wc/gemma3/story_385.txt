Old Man Tiber, a pleasant meddler with a reputation for “helpful nudges,” watched the pre-sunrise quiet settle over the hospital ward, the pale light reflecting off the obsidian skyscraper visible through the window. <17> He wasn’t here for himself, of course, but for the patterns – the subtle shifts in energy he believed held the key to decoding ancient symbols etched into forgotten languages. <34> His current focus was Dr. Aris Thorne, a brilliant but fractured linguist recovering from exhaustion, and the strange nighttime walks Thorne took on the beach below. <53> Tiber had noticed, through careful observation, that Thorne’s footprints, though distinct, seemed to…weaken with each passing night, fading faster than the tide should allow. <73>

Tiber’s method was subtle, openly manipulative in a way that disarmed suspicion; he’d “accidentally” leave things where Thorne would find them, little prompts to steer the doctor’s thoughts. <92> Today, it was a pair of rusted ice skates, inexplicably placed on Thorne’s bedside table. <103> They weren’t Thorne’s, nor did they seem to belong to anyone in the hospital. <114> Tiber knew Thorne, a man haunted by a childhood spent on frozen lakes, would fixate on them, a distraction from the unraveling of his own mental defenses. <134>

The skates were a catalyst, a symbolic representation of lost footing, mirroring the fading footprints. <148> Tiber believed Thorne was unknowingly scattering seeds – not literal ones, but fragments of his subconscious, revealed in the patterns of his nocturnal wanderings. <168> These “seeds” were the key to the symbols, but someone, or something, was actively working to erase them, to weaken Thorne’s connection to the past. <189> 

He’d observed the footprints carefully, noting how they diminished not through natural erosion, but as if…absorbed. <207> The receding footprints weren’t simply disappearing; they were being *taken*. <214> Tiber suspected a presence, something drawn to Thorne’s unraveling mind, feeding on the fragmented memories. <232> The ice skates, a reminder of fragility and loss, were meant to amplify Thorne’s vulnerability, to encourage further scattering, and thus, reveal more of the hidden pattern. <254> 

Tiber wasn’t trying to *help* Thorne heal, not exactly. <262> He needed the symbols decoded, and Thorne, in his weakened state, was the most promising vessel. <277> The lucid confusion in Thorne’s eyes, the way he traced the rust on the skates, confirmed Tiber’s calculations. <294> The seeds were scattering, and the pattern, however fractured, was beginning to emerge. <306> The quiet shift continued, the skyscraper looming, and Tiber waited, a pleasant meddler orchestrating a descent into revelation. <323>
