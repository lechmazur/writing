Old Man Tiber, a selfless musician whose melodies echoed across the salvaged corridors of the *Dustrunner*, hadn’t felt a new longing in decades. <words>17</words>
The *Dustrunner*, a recycled spaceship cobbled together from the wrecks of a forgotten exodus, was his home, his observatory, and his instrument. <words>31</words>
For centuries, he’d charted the migration patterns of the Star-Whales, colossal beings whose songs dictated the flow of interstellar dust, using sound as his compass. <words>49</words>
His method wasn’t charts or calculations, but the overlapping hum of mismatched wind chimes strung throughout the ship, each tuned to a specific frequency of the whales’ calls. <words>68</words>
He believed their trust, once earned, left an intangibly tangible residue on objects – a warmth, a vibration, a story held within. <words>87</words>
He’d been searching for the ‘Source Song’, the first call ever made, believing it held the key to understanding their ancient routes. <words>105</words>
Today, a new signal flickered through the chimes, leading him to a forgotten storage bay and a warped vinyl record. <words>121</words>
The record wasn’t of music, but of static, yet beneath the hiss, Tiber felt it – a resonance, a faint echo of a whale’s song, and something…more. <words>141</words>
It was a mark of trust, left by a long-dead navigator who’d befriended the whales before the Great Scattering. <words>156</words>
But another presence stirred within the *Dustrunner*; Kael, a scavenger known for his savage grace and ruthless efficiency, had been tracking Tiber’s work, seeking to exploit the whales’ routes for profit. <words>178</words>
Kael believed the whales’ paths led to unclaimed resource-rich nebulae, and he wanted the map. <words>191</words>
He found Tiber examining the record, his fingers tracing the grooves, lost in the song of centuries past. <words>206</words>
“That’ll be mine, old man,” Kael rasped, his hand reaching for the vinyl. <words>218</words>
Tiber, despite his age, reacted instantly, a surprising strength fueled by generations of longing and a fierce protectiveness of the whales’ trust; he lunged, knocking Kael back with a force that belied his frail frame. <words>242</words>
The record spun from his grasp, landing softly on a pile of salvaged cushions, its warped surface humming faintly. <words>257</words>
Kael, momentarily stunned, recovered quickly, but the moment of hesitation was enough. <words>270</words>
Tiber didn’t fight; he simply adjusted the wind chimes, amplifying the Source Song, a wave of sound that resonated through the *Dustrunner*, disorienting Kael and revealing the true, complex beauty of the whales’ migration. <words>296</words>
Kael, overwhelmed, stumbled back, his greed replaced by a flicker of understanding, a nascent respect for the ancient beings and the old man who’d dedicated his life to them. <words>316</words>
The song continued, a testament to a trust earned across centuries, a map not of resources, but of connection. <words>332</words>
Tiber smiled, knowing the whales would continue their journey, guided by the echoes of their own song and the unwavering dedication of a selfless musician. <words>351</words>
The *Dustrunner* sailed on, a beacon of hope in the vast, indifferent darkness, carrying the weight of longing and the promise of continued connection. <words>369</words>
