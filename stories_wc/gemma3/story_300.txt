Old Man Tiber, they called him, though he wasn’t particularly old, just…weathered, a determined outlaw with a reputation for finding things best left lost. <15> He stood amidst the crumbling grandeur of the ancient Roman marketplace, a place where echoes of emperors mingled with the dust of forgotten trades. <31> The air itself felt thick with the shimmer of possibility, a subtle energy that tugged at the edges of perception. <47> Tiber was wistfully pragmatic; he didn’t believe in magic, not exactly, but he believed in things *like* magic – undiscovered energies, forgotten technologies, the residue of powerful intent. <71> He was at the threshold of discovery, he could feel it, a tremor in the stones beneath his worn boots. <86>

His motivation wasn’t gold, or glory, but a hidden power source rumored to lie beneath the city, a source the old empire had harnessed and then deliberately buried. <107> He carried only a simple cloth pouch, worn soft with age, containing a few dried figs, a flint, and a handful of oddly colored dusts. <126> It wasn’t much, but it was enough to sustain him while he worked. <138> Today, he wasn’t looking for clues in inscriptions or crumbling statues, but in art. <151>

He began to browse the remnants of a long-abandoned artist’s stall, overturned easels and splintered frames scattered amongst the weeds. <169> Tiber didn’t care for the art itself, the depictions of gods and gladiators held no interest for him. <185> Instead, he was methodically examining the disused canvases, not for the images they once held, but for the paint smudges left behind. <205> Years of research had led him to believe the artists, unknowingly, had been using pigments infused with trace elements that reacted to the energy he sought. <226> He matched paint smudges, a particular shade of ochre here, a fleck of ultramarine there, cross-referencing them with a complex system of notes scribbled on scraps of parchment. <251> 

“Looking for inspiration, old man?” a voice drawled, laced with earnest mockery. <266> A young merchant, barely more than a boy, leaned against a crumbling column, watching him with amusement. <283> Tiber didn’t bother to respond, merely continued his work, his fingers tracing the faded colors. <297> “Waste of time, if you ask me,” the boy persisted. “Just dust and decay.” <309> Tiber finally glanced up, a flicker of something unreadable in his eyes. <323> “Perhaps,” he said, his voice raspy from disuse. “Or perhaps, a map.” <334>

He found it then, a cluster of crimson and gold smudges on a particularly damaged canvas, arranged in a pattern that resonated with a symbol from his notes. <356> The shimmer of possibility intensified, a warmth spreading through the marketplace. <369> He carefully documented the pattern, his hand trembling slightly. <380> The pouch felt heavier now, not with figs and dust, but with the weight of what was to come. <396> The threshold had been crossed. <400>
