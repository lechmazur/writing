Old Man Tiber, a blameless smuggler by trade and necessity, adjusted the collar of his worn coat as the final countdown echoed through the city, each chime a hammer blow against dwindling hope. <30> He wasn’t interested in escape, not precisely; he was interested in remembering. <41> Tiber navigated the echoing curves of the Whispering Gallery, a place built for secrets and now, for final pronouncements. <57> He moved by the scent of a garden at night, a phantom fragrance clinging to the stone, a memory of a life before the walls. <74> It led him, as it always did, towards the forgotten tunnels beneath the city, tunnels he’d begun to map decades ago. <89> 

He wasn’t driven by greed, or even a desire to preserve knowledge, but by a logically emotional need to understand how things *ended*. <107> He carried little – a worn satchel, a lamp, and around his neck, a child’s skeleton key necklace, a memento from a life he rarely spoke of. <126> It wasn’t a key to any physical lock, but to a feeling, a sense of innocence lost, a reminder of what was worth saving, even if only in memory. <144> 

Tonight, however, he’d overreached. <149> The scent led him to a section of the tunnels he hadn’t charted, a place where the stone felt…wrong. <165> The gallery’s whispers seemed to coalesce, forming warnings he’d always ignored, dismissing them as the building settling. <182> He pressed on, driven by the compulsion to complete his map, to understand the city’s skeletal structure before it was silenced forever. <201> 

He found a chamber, vast and echoing, filled with strange machinery humming with residual power. <216> It wasn’t a military installation, nor a power station, but something…older. <228> Something built to listen, to record, to *remember*. <238> Tiber realized, with a grandiose modesty, that his map wasn’t about the tunnels themselves, but about the stories they held, the echoes of lives lived and lost. <261> The necklace warmed against his skin, a small weight anchoring him to the past. <272> He continued to chart the chamber, knowing his work wouldn’t save anyone, but believing, with a quiet certainty, that even in oblivion, remembering was a form of survival. <296> The final chime resonated, but Tiber didn’t flinch; he simply sketched another line on his map, a testament to a city, and a life, fading into silence. <319> He understood the art of survival wasn’t about avoiding the end, but about what you carried with you into it. <336>
