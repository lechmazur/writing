Old Man Hemlock, a weary undertaker whose hands knew the cool weight of too many endings, hadn’t felt surprise in decades. <31> The sudden, sharp crack of a car backfiring in the otherwise silent street outside merely registered as a disruption, a fleeting echo in the vast quiet he preferred. <49> It was the silence *after* that mattered, the hush that allowed the palace to breathe, a palace not of kings and queens, but of echoes and dust – an ancient Persian palace reimagined by a mad architect in the heart of the city. <76> He’d been summoned, not for a body, but for a mind, and a very stubborn one at that. <92>

The scholar, Darius, had been attempting to decipher the astronomical clock, a monstrously intricate device of gears and celestial spheres, for years, claiming it held the key to lost tribal knowledge. <116> Hemlock knew Darius’s work was rarely practical, dismissed by most as fanciful obsession, but the desperation in the man’s patron’s eyes had been… compelling. <136> The patron, a woman named Soraya, believed Darius was on the verge of unlocking something dangerous, something that needed containing. <154>

“He believes the clock doesn’t tell time, but *is* time,” Soraya had explained, her voice a placid ferocity. <171> “And that the knowledge it holds… it’s a burden, not a gift.” <184> Her request wasn’t for death, but for imprisonment. <191> Not within walls, but within a pattern. <198>

Hemlock understood; he dealt in finality, but Soraya sought preservation, a holding pattern against the absolute dark. <216> He was to imprison Darius, not with chains, but by following the sun paths dictated by the clock’s movements, creating a ritualistic confinement within the palace’s courtyards. <241> Each day, Darius would be moved to a new location, dictated by the shadow cast by a specific gear, a slow, deliberate dance mirroring the celestial mechanics. <263> 

It wasn’t about preventing Darius from *studying* the clock, but from *sharing* what he learned. <278> The tribal knowledge, Soraya feared, wasn’t meant for this age. <290> Hemlock, accustomed to the weight of secrets, began the ritual, his movements precise, his face unreadable. <305> He wasn’t a jailer, but a keeper of thresholds, holding onto hope in a world increasingly devoid of it, one sun-drenched step at a time. <327> The clock ticked on, a silent guardian of forgotten lore, and Hemlock, the weary undertaker, continued his placidly ferocious task. <346>
