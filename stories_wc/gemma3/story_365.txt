Old Man Tiber, they called him, though he hadn’t felt truly old until he became a deflated oracle, his pronouncements whispers lost in the static of the subconscious. <words>18</words>
He sat amongst the chipped paint and faded velvet of an abandoned carnival ring toss game, the scent of stale popcorn clinging to the air like regret. <words>32</words>
His motivation wasn’t prophecy, not anymore; it was to rewrite history, to untangle the knots of what *was* and weave a different tapestry of what *could be*. <words>51</words>
He held an empty perfume bottle, its delicate glass cool against his palm, a vessel for lost scents and forgotten promises – a fitting tool for his task. <words>68</words>
Tiber was independently dependent, a paradox of existence; he needed the subconscious to exist, yet he shaped it with a will entirely his own. <words>85</words>
His method to enact this change was peculiar, even for the dreamlike realm they inhabited: by reconfiguring the braids of a centuries-old ceremonial rope, each strand representing a thread of time. <words>106</words>
The rope lay coiled before him, a labyrinth of crimson and gold, humming with the weight of countless yesterdays. <words>119</words>
He wasn’t issuing commands, not exactly; he was sending dreamlike invitations, subtle shifts in the collective unconscious, nudging possibilities into being. <words>137</words>
Each adjustment to the rope’s intricate weave sent ripples through the subconscious, altering memories, influencing choices, and subtly reshaping the past. <words>156</words>
A melancholic glee bubbled within him as he worked, a bittersweet satisfaction in wielding such power, knowing the changes would be felt but rarely understood. <words>175</words>
He’d begun with small things – a kinder word spoken, a missed connection made – testing the waters, gauging the resistance of the established timeline. <words>193</words>
The perfume bottle wasn’t for scent, but for focus; he’d fill it with the *feeling* of the desired outcome, then pour that essence into the knot he was unraveling. <words>213</words>
Today, he was attempting something bolder: preventing a single, devastating argument that had fractured a family line centuries ago. <words>231</words>
His fingers, gnarled and slow, moved with surprising precision, untangling a particularly stubborn knot of crimson thread. <words>247</words>
He imagined the scene, the harsh words, the irreparable damage, and then, with a gentle tug, he began to weave a new possibility – a moment of understanding, a shared laugh, a connection preserved. <words>271</words>
The rope pulsed with a faint golden light, and Tiber felt a familiar ache, the strain of altering the fundamental fabric of reality. <words>289</words>
It wasn’t about creating a perfect past, he knew; it was about offering alternatives, about acknowledging the infinite potential within every moment. <words>308</words>
He continued to work, lost in the intricate dance of time and memory, a deflated oracle finding purpose in the quiet act of rewriting what was. <words>327</words>
The carnival remained silent, a ghostly witness to his melancholic glee, the empty perfume bottle gleaming softly in the dim, subconscious light. <words>346</words>
He knew his efforts were fleeting, that the subconscious was a restless sea, but for now, he had offered a new dream, a different invitation. <words>364</words>
