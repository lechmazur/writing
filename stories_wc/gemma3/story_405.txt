Old Man Tiber, a skeptical gambler whose luck had long since soured, ran a peculiar operation beneath the city: an underground mushroom farm illuminated by bioluminescent fungi. <words>21</words>
Amidst recipe testing for a new truffle oil – a desperate attempt to recoup losses – he wasn’t cultivating mushrooms for profit, but for a purpose only he understood, a frantic peace settling over him as he worked. <words>42</words>
His true motivation wasn’t culinary, but to guide lost travelers, those who wandered too far into the city’s forgotten tunnels, to safety, a task he undertook by interpreting cryptic scrawls on subway seats. <words>66</words>
These weren’t random acts of vandalism; Tiber believed they were echoes of past wanderers, pleas for help disguised as graffiti, and he’d developed a knack for deciphering them. <words>86</words>
He carried a collection of dried petals, each representing a traveler he’d successfully led out, pressing them into the pages of a worn leather-bound journal. <words>107</words>
Today’s scrawl was particularly unsettling: a looping pattern resembling a root system, accompanied by the phrase “The Bloom Consumes.” <words>126</words>
Tiber knew this meant someone was trapped near the old abandoned greenhouse, a place choked with mutated flora and shadowed by uncharted grief. <words>146</words>
He’d learned to truthfully lie to the lost, offering false directions that subtly steered them towards the exits, a necessary deception to avoid panic. <words>167</words>
The city’s transit authority, however, was becoming suspicious of his frequent excursions into the tunnels, and his battered van, affectionately nicknamed “The Spore Carrier,” was about to be impounded. <words>189</words>
“Just a routine inspection,” the officer had said, but Tiber knew better; they were closing in on his operation, dismissing his warnings as the ramblings of a madman. <words>211</words>
He had to reach the greenhouse before they did, before the “Bloom” claimed another soul. <words>224</words>
He raced through the tunnels, the bioluminescent mushrooms casting eerie shadows, the scent of damp earth and decay filling his lungs. <words>244</words>
He found her huddled amongst the overgrown vines, a young woman sketching the monstrous blooms, lost in a world of vibrant, poisonous beauty. <words>264</words>
“The train to Willow Creek leaves in five minutes,” Tiber lied, pointing her in the opposite direction of the greenhouse, towards the faint glimmer of an exit. <words>286</words>
He watched her go, adding another dried petal to his journal, a small victory against the consuming darkness, even as he knew the authorities would soon arrive. <words>307</words>
The frantic peace returned, a quiet acceptance of his fate, knowing he’d done what he could, one truthfully-lied direction at a time, amidst the endless recipe testing and the silent, watchful mushrooms. <words>333</words>
He knew his work wasn’t about mushrooms or recipes, but about offering a fragile hope in a city drowning in forgotten sorrows, a beacon in the uncharted grief. <words>355</words>
The impound notice felt less like a defeat, and more like a necessary pause, a moment to prepare for the next scrawl, the next lost traveler, the next lie told in truth. <words>376</words>
