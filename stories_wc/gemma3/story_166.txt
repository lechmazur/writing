<story>
Old Man Tiber, a ghostly caretaker with a solemnly silly grin, drifted amongst the skeletal apple trees of the frozen orchard. <words>17</words>
The orchard wasn’t truly frozen, not entirely; geothermal streams snaked beneath the icy ground, keeping the roots alive and lending an eerie warmth to the perpetual winter. <words>32</words>
It was after the last wish had been granted at the wishing well, a time when the veil between worlds thinned and Tiber’s duties shifted from granting desires to…well, observing the threads of fate. <words>51</words>
He’d discovered, through forbidden expedition logs detailing the orchard’s origins, that the trees weren’t merely plants, but antennae, subtly influencing the destinies of creatures near and far. <words>72</words>
Tiber’s motivation wasn’t power, or even understanding, but a desperate desire to communicate with the animals who frequented the orchard – the snow hares, the ravens, the stoic arctic foxes. <words>94</words>
He believed they held the key to interpreting the orchard’s whispers. <words>101</words>
Today, he held a single, bright yellow plastic straw, an oddity in this timeless landscape, and a tool for his peculiar work. <words>117</words>
He intended to perforate the very fabric of fate, not with grand spells, but with tiny, precise holes. <words>131</words>
The logs suggested that disrupting the flow, even minutely, could amplify the orchard’s signals, making them audible to animal ears. <words>149</words>
Tiber began, carefully piercing the air above a sleeping hare with the straw, a gentle chaos blooming around him as shimmering lines briefly fractured and reformed. <words>169</words>
He wasn’t altering destinies, he insisted to the skeptical ravens, merely…tuning the frequency. <words>183</words>
The hare twitched, its nose wiggling, and then, impossibly, it *responded* – a flicker of thought, a sense of peaceful curiosity, washing over Tiber. <words>203</words>
“Remarkable,” he murmured, his silly grin widening. <words>208</words>
He moved on, perforating the air around a fox, then a flock of snow buntings, each tiny hole a whispered question, a hopeful plea for connection. <words>228</words>
The orchard hummed with a newfound energy, the geothermal streams pulsing a little brighter. <words>241</words>
It wasn’t a perfect translation, not a clear conversation, but a feeling, a shared awareness. <words>254</words>
The animals weren’t *telling* him anything, but he was *feeling* with them, weaving through fate alongside their instincts and desires. <words>272</words>
Tiber realized the logs hadn’t revealed *how* to communicate, but *where* to listen – within the interconnectedness of all living things. <words>290</words>
He continued his work, a ghostly figure in a frozen orchard, armed with a plastic straw and a heart full of hopeful, silly chaos. <words>306</words>
The last wish may have been granted, but for Tiber, a new journey had just begun, a journey of shared senses and whispered destinies. <words>324</words>
He knew, with a certainty that warmed him more than any geothermal stream, that the animals were listening, and that was enough. <words>342</words>
The orchard, and its threads of fate, were finally singing to him. <words>352</words>
And he, the ghostly caretaker, was finally part of the chorus. <words>362</words>
