Old Man Tiber, a self-proclaimed “disruptor of quietude” and conventionally rebellious soul, wasn’t anyone’s idea of a prophet, yet the fractured city of Aethelburg whispered his name with a haunting delight. <31>
He’d begun seeing the glimmering transitions – moments where reality seemed to fray at the edges, revealing possibilities just beyond grasp – after a particularly brutal estrangement from his daughter, Lyra. <53>
It started, oddly enough, with a run-in at the late-night laundromat, where a woman, eyes like chipped amethyst, pressed a single, wilted paper flower into his hand, murmuring about “the unraveling.” <79>
Tiber hadn’t understood then, but the flower, brittle and fading, became a focal point for his visions, a symbol of the delicate balance between worlds. <102>
Now, he resided mostly within the abandoned study of a long-dead giant, its bookshelves towering like cliffs, dust motes dancing in the shafts of moonlight. <126>
This wasn’t a life he’d chosen; it was a necessity, a space between scenes where he could collect the fragments of Aethelburg’s collective consciousness. <149>
His motivation wasn’t power, but unification – to weave the scattered minds of the city back together under a single, coherent vision before the transitions consumed them all. <176>
He believed the city’s citizens were losing their ability to perceive the subtle shifts, becoming trapped in rigid realities, blind to the potential for change. <199>
He’d spend hours tracing the giant’s forgotten maps, searching for ley lines, points where the glimmering transitions were strongest, hoping to amplify them, not control them. <226>
Lyra, of course, thought he was mad, a broken man clinging to delusions, and her rejection fueled his urgency, a painful echo in the vast study. <249>
He’d tried to show her the visions, the shimmering overlays on everyday life, but she only saw a desperate father, lost in grief and regret. <271>
Tonight, the paper flower felt particularly cold in his hand, a premonition of a coming surge, a transition so powerful it threatened to shatter Aethelburg completely. <296>
He knew he had to reach more people, to awaken them before it was too late, to share the unsettling beauty of the unraveling, and the hope hidden within it. <321>
The giant’s study felt less like a refuge and more like the eye of a storm, a silent vigil before the world shifted once more. <341>
He clutched the flower, a fragile beacon in the gathering darkness, ready to face the glimmering chaos. <358>
