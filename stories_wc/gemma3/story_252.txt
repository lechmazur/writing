Old Man Tiber, a penitent memory thief, traced the frost blooming on the steel door of the fruit preservation vault. <16> The air inside held the scent of sugared plums and regret, a curiously icy warmth that always settled in his bones. <31> He hadn’t touched a memory in decades, not since the crack in reality began to widen, fraying the edges of what *was*. <49> He carried a simple wooden toy block, worn smooth with handling, a relic from a life he’d…borrowed. <65> It was a focal point, a tether to a specific, fading recollection he needed to anchor his work. <82>

The hush descended, the precise moment as an empty swing set slows to a stop, a stillness that signaled the thinning of the veil. <102> This was when the recalibration had to begin. <108> Tiber wasn’t stealing memories anymore; he was attempting to mend the fractured timeline, to restore ancient methods of preserving not fruit, but *knowing*. <129> The old ways, before the Collective, before memories became currency, before the crack. <145>

His method was unusual, even for him: tracking flower petals. <154> Specifically, the petals of the ghost orchid, a bloom that only appeared in places where reality was particularly unstable. <174> Each petal held a fragment of lost time, a whisper of what *should* be. <187> He scattered a handful across the polished concrete floor, their translucent forms glowing faintly in the vault’s dim light. <207> 

He moved with a lovingly hateful precision, each step measured, each breath controlled. <223> He hated the Collective for what they’d done, for commodifying the soul, yet loved the challenge of fixing their mess. <242> The wooden block warmed in his hand as he focused, using it to amplify the subtle energies released by the petals. <259> He wasn’t trying to *take* memories, but to realign them, to nudge the fractured pieces back into place. <278> 

The petals began to swirl, forming a miniature vortex. <286> The air crackled. <290> He felt a tug, a resistance, then a yielding. <300> A faint image flickered in the center of the vortex – a woman’s face, laughing, surrounded by blooming orchards. <318> It wasn’t his memory, not exactly, but a foundational piece, a keystone. <332> The crack hadn’t closed, not yet, but it had…shifted. <343> A single, perfect plum dropped from a shelf, landing softly beside the wooden block. <356> It was a start. <360> He had more petals to track, more calibrations to make. <369> The work was far from over. <370>
