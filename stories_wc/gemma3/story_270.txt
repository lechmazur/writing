Old Man Tiber, a cynic even amongst ghosts, traced the brass meridian of the astronomical globe with a calloused thumb. <words>14</words>
Dust motes danced in the single shaft of light piercing the gloom of the forgotten library, nestled high within the lighthouse’s stone core. <words>28</words>
He’d spent across the hush of a borrowed century here, cataloging not books, but absences – the echoes of lives lived and lost to the sea. <words>43</words>
Tiber was, admittedly, humbly arrogant; he believed he understood the currents of ephemeral energy better than any mage before him. <words>59</words>
His motivation wasn’t power, but to harness the ephemeral, to bottle the fading light of memories before they dissolved completely. <words>76</words>
The globe wasn’t merely a map of stars, but a resonator, attuned to the whispers of forgotten constellations and the souls adrift amongst them. <words>93</words>
He needed a catalyst, something to bridge the gap between worlds, and he’d found it in a peculiar resonance – the echo of a voice in a canyon. <words>111</words>
Years ago, a traveler had described a canyon where a single word, spoken at dawn, would return sevenfold, layered and distorted. <words>128</words>
Tiber had painstakingly recreated the acoustic conditions within the lighthouse’s hollow structure, focusing the sound through quartz crystals. <words>146</words>
Now, he prepared to awaken something ancient, something slumbering within the globe’s intricate workings. <words>158</words>
He began to chant, not in a language of power, but in the fragmented dialect of a long-dead sailor, his voice a rasp against the silence. <words>176</words>
The crystals hummed, then pulsed with a pale, ethereal light, mirroring the constellations etched onto the globe’s surface. <words>193</words>
A voice, not his own, but a chorus of whispers, began to rise, echoing the sailor’s lament, amplified and distorted by the lighthouse’s stone. <words>213</words>
The globe spun faster, the light intensifying, revealing not stars, but faces – fleeting glimpses of those lost at sea, their eyes filled with a shared isolation. <words>234</words>
Tiber felt a pang, a flicker of something he hadn’t allowed himself to feel in decades: empathy. <words>248</words>
He wasn’t merely collecting echoes; he was offering solace, a momentary reunion for souls adrift in the vast, indifferent cosmos. <words>267</words>
The eerie nostalgia of the moment threatened to overwhelm him, but he held firm, a cynical conjurer momentarily humbled by the weight of remembrance. <words>287</words>
He realized, with a chilling clarity, that he wasn’t harnessing the ephemeral, but *being* harnessed by it, a vessel for the forgotten. <words>306</words>
The light reached a crescendo, then subsided, leaving only the faint hum of the crystals and the lingering scent of salt and sorrow. <words>324</words>
The globe stilled, its surface now reflecting not stars, but the weary, knowing eyes of Old Man Tiber, forever bound to the lighthouse and its spectral inhabitants. <words>343</words>
He was no longer alone in his isolation. <words>351</words>
