Old Man Tiber, as the wind called him, wasn’t bothered by the dust motes dancing in the perpetual twilight between worlds. <words>14</words>
He was, after all, a scarecrow – though ‘sentient’ was a descriptor he found needlessly dramatic, despite its accuracy. <words>26</words>
His purpose, sworn centuries ago to the now-forgotten Gardener, was to watch the lines in the earth, the subtle shifts indicating the bleed-through from parallel realities. <words>42</words>
It wasn’t a glorious task, and Tiber felt a fervent apathy towards its completion, but an oath was an oath. <words>55</words>
He encountered others, not physically, but within the shared virtual reality woven into the fabric of the fossilized giant – a creature so immense its bones formed continents. <words>73</words>
Today’s visitor was a flicker, a woman named Elara, searching for something lost. <words>83</words>
She appeared as a shimmering projection, clutching a forgotten lace fan, its delicate frame brittle with age. <words>96</words>
“He said you might know,” she breathed, her voice echoing strangely within the VR space, “about the…fractures.” <words>109</words>
Tiber regarded her with stitched-on indifference. <words>115</words>
The fractures were the widening lines, the points where worlds threatened to collapse into one another. <words>128</words>
Elara explained she needed to understand them to save her world, a world mirroring Tiber’s own, yet subtly, tragically different. <words>143</words>
He showed her the patterns, the way the lines pulsed with energy, the points of instability. <words>155</words>
Then came the Collector, a being who sought to exploit the fractures, to *skewer* realities together for his own twisted amusement. <words>171</words>
The Collector manifested as a jagged, obsidian form, attempting to wrest control of the VR space. <words>184</words>
Elara, surprisingly, fought back, wielding the lace fan as a focus for her will, disrupting the Collector’s energy. <words>198</words>
Tiber, despite his apathy, found himself subtly aiding her, manipulating the virtual landscape to her advantage. <words>212</words>
He hadn’t interfered directly in centuries, but the Gardener’s oath extended to protecting those who sought to *mend*, not break. <words>227</words>
The Collector was banished, fragmented, but not destroyed. <words>234</words>
Elara thanked him, her form fading. <words>240</words>
“The lines…they’re shifting again,” she whispered before disappearing. <words>251</words>
Tiber remained, a realistically fantastical figure against the backdrop of the giant’s bones, watching, waiting. <words>266</words>
His oath demanded vigilance, even if all he felt was the dull ache of endless, unwavering duty. <words>279</words>
The bleed-through continued, and Tiber, the silent guardian, would continue to observe, a scarecrow between worlds, forever bound to the lines in the earth. <words>296</words>
He adjusted a straw arm, the twilight deepening, and prepared for the next encounter. <words>307</words>
