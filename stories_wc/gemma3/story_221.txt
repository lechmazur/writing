Old Man Tiber, they called me, though I wasn’t old, just…weathered, a wreck-diver with a peculiar gift for hearing the echoes of the drowned. <14> I was, as my grandmother used to say, joyfully melancholic, finding beauty in the rust and ruin of things lost to the sea. <27> This year’s Founder’s Day meant another trip to the abandoned carnival, a family tradition begun by my great-grandfather, a tradition I usually avoided, preferring the silent company of shipwrecks. <46> But this year felt different, a fleeting rebellion stirring within me, a need to step out of the shadow of my father’s legendary dives and my mother’s renowned psychic abilities. <66>

The shooting gallery was exactly as I remembered: peeling paint, shattered glass underfoot, and the ghostly scent of cotton candy. <79> I wasn’t here for the games, though; I was here for *her*. <84> Locals whispered of a woman who’d lost her heart – and a valuable piece of amber – within the carnival’s grounds decades ago. <99> I’d been receiving fragments of her story between the lines of a half-written letter, a correspondence begun by my grandmother and continued, unknowingly, by me. <118> The letter spoke of a love betrayed, a stolen treasure, and a lingering sorrow. <129>

I found it nestled amongst the rusted targets: a piece of amber, perfectly preserved, with a tiny, iridescent beetle trapped inside. <146> As I touched it, a wave of emotion washed over me, not sadness, but a strange, vibrant ache – arousal, not of the flesh, but of the soul. <161> The woman’s voice, clear as a bell, filled my mind, thanking me for finding her lost piece of herself. <174> 

“It wasn’t the amber’s worth,” she whispered, “but the memory it held, the joy of a summer love.” <189> Holding the amber, I understood; it wasn’t about recovering a lost object, but about thawing a frozen heart. <204> My gift wasn’t just about hearing the dead, but about helping them find peace, about rekindling the embers of forgotten joy. <221> I realized my father’s dives and my mother’s visions weren’t the only ways to honor our family legacy. <236> 

Returning to the surface, I felt lighter, the melancholic weight lessened by a newfound purpose. <251> The carnival, once a symbol of obligation, now felt like a gateway, a place where I could use my abilities not to dwell on loss, but to celebrate the enduring power of love and memory. <273> I wasn’t just Tiber, the wreck-diver; I was Tiber, the one who listened, the one who healed, the one who finally stepped into his own light. <293> The amber warmed in my palm, a tiny sun holding a universe of feeling. <304> Perhaps, I thought, joy and sorrow weren’t opposites, but two sides of the same beautiful, fragile thing. <318> And maybe, just maybe, that was enough. <324>
