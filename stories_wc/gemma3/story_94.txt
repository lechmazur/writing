Dr. Aris Thorne, a heartbreak counselor renowned for her unsettlingly beautiful clients and even more unsettling advice, traced the rim of the sky reflection pool with a long, scarlet nail. <words>14</words>
She was, herself, a masterpiece of curated sorrow, a femme fatale specializing in the wreckage of others’ desires, though few suspected the source of her own ache. <words>29</words>
After the invention of time travel, everyone carried echoes of past selves, regrets solidified into phantom limbs, and Aris had become the surgeon of those spectral wounds. <words>46</words>
Today, she waited for Elias Vance, a man whose grief was…different, a gravitational pull towards a future he couldn’t quite reach. <words>61</words>
Aris adjusted the amber earrings, a gift from a client who’d successfully erased a decade of bad choices – a beautiful, brittle reminder of the gravity of desires. <words>79</words>
She was restlessly curious about Elias; his file spoke of a lost love, but his temporal signature pulsed with something more, a desperate attempt to *alter* a fixed point. <words>98</words>
He arrived, looking haunted, and began to speak of Lyra, the woman he’d lost not to death, but to a different timeline, a version of herself who’d chosen another. <words>121</words>
“I track her cloud trails,” he confessed, his voice a low rasp, “the residual energy of her jumps… hoping to find a convergence.” <words>138</words>
Aris listened, her expression carefully neutral, as he described a method bordering on obsession, a frantic attempt to rewrite fate. <words>155</words>
“You believe you can force a reunion?” she asked, her voice soft, yet edged with a knowing sadness. <words>168</words>
Elias nodded, then, with a sudden, impulsive movement, he reached for the pool’s surface, attempting to *zip* through the reflected sky, to chase a phantom echo. <words>189</words>
Aris caught his arm, her grip surprisingly strong. <words>195</words>
“It’s a cage, Elias,” she said, her amber earrings catching the light, “this relentless pursuit. A beautiful, agonizing cage of illusions.” <words>214</words>
He struggled, then stilled, his eyes meeting hers, recognizing a shared understanding of temporal imprisonment. <words>228</words>
“You… you understand?” he breathed, finally relinquishing the attempt. <words>237</words>
“I do,” Aris replied, a flicker of something akin to hope crossing her face. <words>245</words>
“I’ve spent years helping others proclaim their freedom, but I’ve never truly felt it myself.” <words>261</words>
She released his arm, a small, cautious smile playing on her lips. <words>270</words>
“Perhaps,” she said, “we can both begin now.” <words>277</words>
The sky reflection pool shimmered, holding not promises of altered timelines, but the quiet possibility of acceptance. <words>294</words>
Aris realized her work wasn’t about fixing broken hearts, but about acknowledging the weight of choices, the inescapable gravity of desires, and the courage to finally let go. <words>315</words>
It was a liberation she hadn’t known she craved, a freedom born not of escape, but of surrender. <words>331</words>
The amber earrings felt a little less heavy, a little less brittle. <words>341</words>
A single cloud trail drifted across the pool’s surface, a silent farewell to a future that never was. <words>357</words>
