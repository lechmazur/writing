Old Man Tiber, a jovial sellsword with a laugh like tumbling stones, hadn’t sought treasure in decades, preferring ale and amiable brawls. <words>14</words>
He’d been summoned, however, by a frantic herbalist, Elara, to recover a stolen heirloom – not gold, but an astronomical telescope, crucial to her work within the sprawling witch’s herb garden. <words>31</words>
Elara explained the telescope wasn’t merely for charting stars, but for observing the ‘Withering Vow,’ a celestial alignment that dictated the potency of her potions, and its theft coincided with a creeping blight. <words>52</words>
Tiber was boldly reluctant; he hadn’t the patience for star-gazing, but Elara offered a peculiar payment: access to her family’s tradition of crafting time capsules, a practice meant to dethrone doubt from the mind. <words>76</words>
His own doubt, a gnawing beast, had plagued him since a battlefield betrayal, and the idea of burying it, literally, appealed. <words>94</words>
The trail led to Silas, a disgraced astronomer obsessed with reversing the Vow, believing it held the key to immortality. <words>111</words>
Silas hadn’t simply stolen the telescope; he’d begun dismantling it, attempting to harness the Vow’s energy during its transformation, a dangerous act that warped the garden itself. <words>133</words>
Elegant mayhem ensued – Tiber, surprisingly nimble for his size, deflected Silas’s magically-charged tools with his sword while Elara unleashed a flurry of stinging nettles and soporific fumes. <words>156</words>
The fight raged throughout the transformation, the garden shifting between vibrant bloom and skeletal decay as the Vow reached its peak. <words>174</words>
Tiber, dodging a blast of corrupted starlight, realized Silas wasn’t seeking power, but desperately trying to *undo* a past mistake, a failed attempt to save his wife. <words>197</words>
A flicker of understanding softened Tiber’s resolve, but Silas was too consumed by grief to notice. <words>211</words>
With a final, well-aimed throw, Tiber disarmed Silas and secured the telescope, its lenses still glowing with celestial energy. <words>230</words>
Elara, restoring the telescope, stabilized the garden, the blight receding with the Vow’s passing. <words>245</words>
True to her word, she guided Tiber through the time capsule ritual, helping him inscribe his regrets onto aged parchment and bury them beneath a blossoming moonpetal. <words>268</words>
It wasn’t a cure, but a containment, a symbolic act of letting go. <words>280</words>
As he left the garden, the weight on his chest felt lighter, replaced by a quiet resolve. <words>294</words>
He hadn’t found gold, but something far more valuable: a space to bury his doubt, and a reminder that even a jovial sellsword could benefit from a little elegant mayhem and a family tradition. <words>318</words>
The telescope, safely returned, continued to watch the stars, a silent guardian against those who would tamper with the delicate balance of the Withering Vow. <words>338</words>
Tiber smiled, a genuine, unburdened smile, and headed towards the nearest tavern, ready for a well-deserved ale. <words>355</words>
