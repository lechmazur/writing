Old Man Tiber, they called me, though my real name was Silas Blackwood, cryptid researcher working undercover as a groundskeeper at the abandoned Blackwood Institute. <31> During leaf raking, a surprisingly peaceful task for someone hunting the Jersey Devil’s cousin, I noticed a flicker of movement within the labyrinth of broken mirrors that was once the Institute’s optics lab. <53> The mirrors, remnants of experiments attempting to weaponize light, now fractured reality into a thousand distorted reflections, a perfect hiding place for…well, anything. <76> I carried a battered plastic tray, ostensibly for leaves, but really for collecting anomalous residue – dust that shimmered, oddly shaped pebbles, things that shouldn’t be. <98> 

I’d been sent to Blackwood to investigate rumors of the “Glimmer Man,” a being said to appear only in reflections, and to sow seeds of a better tomorrow, a directive from the oddly optimistic foundation funding my work. <124> My motivation wasn’t glory, but a belief that understanding the strange could prevent future disasters. <140> I was, admittedly, suspiciously trusting, a flaw that had gotten me into trouble before, but one I justified as open-mindedness. <161> 

Inside the lab, the air tasted like ozone and regret. <168> A single, half-burnt candle sat on a steel table, its wax pooled like a dark secret. <182> I decided to excel at this investigation, not through brute force, but through observation. <192> I began to trace the burn pattern in a blackened candle wick, a technique I’d learned from a Romanian witch who specialized in temporal anomalies. <216> The pattern wasn’t random; it was a map, a distorted representation of the Institute’s original floor plan, but with one crucial addition: a hidden chamber. <239>

As I deciphered the wick’s message, a figure coalesced in the largest mirror, not a reflection of *me*, but of a younger man, radiating an unsettling familiarity. <263> A fateful encounter, undoubtedly. <267> He smiled, a mischievous wisdom in his eyes, and extended a hand. <277> “Took you long enough, Silas,” he said, his voice echoing from the glass. <288> “I’ve been waiting to show you what your grandfather *really* discovered here.” <303> The tray slipped from my grasp, clattering against the broken glass, as I realized the Glimmer Man wasn’t a creature to be feared, but a ghost of my own lineage, a guide to a legacy I never knew existed. <332> He was offering me not danger, but a chance to truly understand the Blackwood name. <346> And, despite my better judgement, I reached back. <355>
