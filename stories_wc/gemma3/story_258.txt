Old Man Tiber, a nimble locksmith more attuned to the echoes of things than their substance – physically metaphysical, some said – waited for the final leaf to drop from the ancient oak. <words>18</words>
He knew when it fell, the orchard, a precarious circle of driftwood adrift on the open sea, would shift, revealing the next fragment of the truth. <words>31</words>
Tiber wasn’t interested in treasure, not gold or jewels, but in preserving the indigenous dances of the Sunken Isles, dances lost when the world changed and land became water. <words>49</words>
His method was peculiar: via dusty yearbooks salvaged from submerged towns, filled with questionable annotations left by those who remembered. <words>66</words>
He’d found a torn map corner tucked inside a 1927 yearbook from Aethelburg, a coastal village swallowed whole by the rising tides, and it was the key. <words>84</words>
The map didn’t show land, but currents – currents that mirrored the steps of the dances, the flow of energy the Islanders believed connected them to the world’s heart. <words>103</words>
As the last leaf spiraled down, the driftwood groaned, and a section of the orchard tilted, revealing a hidden compartment beneath the oldest apple tree. <words>122</words>
Inside wasn’t a chest, but a series of intricately carved wooden birds, each representing a different dance, and a journal detailing the storm of secrets that led to the Isles’ demise. <words>143</words>
The journal spoke of a silencing, a deliberate erasure of the Islanders’ culture by a mainland power fearing their connection to something ancient and powerful. <words>162</words>
Tiber felt a jaded wonder bloom within him; he’d expected loss, but not such calculated cruelty. <words>175</words>
He began to prance, a strange, jerky movement mirroring the ‘Wave Weaver’ dance described in the journal, feeling the energy of the lost Islanders flow through him. <words>194</words>
The wooden birds pulsed with a faint light, and the orchard seemed to breathe, responding to his movements. <words>208</words>
He realized the map corner wasn’t about *finding* the dances, but *reawakening* them, using his skill as a locksmith to unlock the memories held within the wood and the water. <words>229</words>
Each bird, each dance, was a key to understanding what had been lost, and a shield against its repetition. <words>244</words>
The yearbooks weren’t just records, but conduits, allowing him to touch the hands of those who’d danced before, to feel their joy and their sorrow. <words>263</words>
He continued to prance, the movements becoming smoother, more fluid, the orchard stabilizing around him, a beacon of remembrance in the vast, indifferent sea. <words>283</words>
He wasn’t just preserving dances; he was rebuilding a world, one step, one memory, one unlocked secret at a time. <words>301</words>
The storm of secrets raged on, but now, Tiber had a lighthouse in his heart, and the rhythm of the waves echoed the beat of a defiant, ancient drum. <words>321</words>
He knew his work was far from over, but with each dance reawakened, the Sunken Isles lived again, if only in the whispers of the wind and the sway of the driftwood. <words>341</words>
And as long as he could remember the steps, they would never truly be lost. <words>354</words>
