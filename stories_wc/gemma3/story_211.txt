Old Man Tiber, a lucky gambler even in the hush of the unremembered future, found solace in the skeletal remains of Promise, a ghost town swallowed by dust and regret. <30> He’d taken up residence in the abandoned schoolhouse, its chipped paint and broken windows offering a peculiar kind of comfort. <46> Tiber wasn’t searching for riches anymore, just a way to defy the gravity of hopelessness that clung to everything like the desert grit. <67> He spent his days meticulously copying entries from a botanical diary he’d salvaged – a vibrant record of life in a world that had largely forgotten how to bloom. <89> 

Tiber typically never spoke of his past, but he’d begun a strange ritual with the few wanderers who stumbled through Promise: spin-the-bottle confessions. <109> It wasn’t about truth, exactly, but about duplication – each confession, each shared secret, he’d painstakingly transcribe into a second diary, mirroring the original. <133> He believed that by replicating the stories, the vulnerabilities, he could somehow dilute the power they held, the power that had corrupted so many before. <156> 

The diary itself detailed the rise and fall of Mayor Bellwether, a man who’d initially used his knowledge of botany to revitalize the region, then twisted it to control the water supply, and ultimately, the people. <183> Bellwether’s initial benevolence had been a carefully constructed facade, a way to consolidate power. <196> Tiber saw the pattern repeating in the small cruelties of the wanderers, in their desperate attempts to gain an advantage, even in a world with nothing left to gain. <221>

He approached the ritual with a cheerful despair, offering stale biscuits and lukewarm water alongside the bottle. <238> Each spin revealed a new layer of self-deception, a new instance of someone grasping for control. <253> He’d duplicate their confessions, not to judge, but to understand the insidious nature of power, how it bloomed from the smallest seeds of ambition. <277> The second diary wasn’t a record of sins, but a warning – a testament to the fragility of good intentions. <294> 

One day, a young woman, her eyes mirroring the dust storms, confessed to hoarding the last known seeds of a flowering cactus. <316> Tiber smiled, a sad, knowing smile, and began to copy her words, hoping that even in the unremembered future, a little bit of beauty could be preserved, even if only as a duplicate. <342> He continued his work, a lonely sentinel against the encroaching darkness, believing that even cheerful despair was a form of resistance. <362>
