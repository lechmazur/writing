<story>
Old Man Tiber, a meek blacksmith despite the city’s need for no metal, sat in the underwater city planning office, the bioluminescent coral casting long shadows across his workbench. <words>18</words>
He wasn’t planning structures of glass and kelp, but verifying stories – half-baked tales from the occasional, desperate hitchhikers who drifted through the currents in the hush of time’s final ripple. <words>34</words>
His task, openly hidden within the bureaucratic sprawl, was to ignite something, to fuel the city’s failing core. <words>47</words>
Not with electricity, or geothermal vents, but with heartbreak. <words>55</words>
The city’s founders, long dissolved into the ocean’s memory, believed sorrow was the purest energy source, and Tiber was their reluctant custodian. <words>71</words>
He held a softcover dictionary, its pages swollen and blurred, not for definitions, but for cross-referencing details in the hitchhikers’ narratives. <words>88</words>
Each corroborated detail, each verified fragment of loss, added a flicker to the city’s dimming lights. <words>103</words>
Today’s traveler, a woman with eyes like polished stones, spoke of a lover lost to the surface world, a world Tiber barely remembered. <words>119</words>
She claimed he’d promised to return with a specific seashell, one described with impossible precision – a detail Tiber found in a forgotten entry in the dictionary. <words>137</words>
It was an unfinished bargain, a promise broken, and the weight of it resonated within the city’s crystalline structures. <words>152</words>
Tiber meticulously recorded the verification, the dictionary’s damp pages sticking together. <words>163</words>
He wasn’t interested in justice, or closure, only in the raw energy of regret. <words>175</words>
The city didn’t *need* the seashell; it needed the ache of its absence. <words>185</words>
He’d spent centuries at this, a quiet, unassuming figure sifting through the wreckage of other people’s lives. <words>201</words>
Each story was a piece of a larger, agonizing puzzle, and each verification brought the city a little closer to… something. <words>217</words>
He didn’t know what. <words>220</words>
Perhaps simply prolonging its existence, fueled by the luminous regret of those who had loved and lost. <words>236</words>
The woman finished her tale, a single tear dissolving into the water. <words>246</words>
Tiber nodded, a barely perceptible movement, and the city pulsed with a faint, renewed glow. <words>261</words>
He knew, with a weary certainty, that another hitchhiker would arrive soon, bearing another broken heart, another unfinished bargain. <words>280</words>
And he would be there, with his dictionary, ready to listen, to verify, to ignite the darkness with the embers of sorrow. <words>298</words>
It was a lonely task, but someone had to harness heartbreak, even across the hush of time’s final ripple. <words>314</words>
The weight of it settled upon him, a familiar, aching burden. <words>325</words>
He turned a page in the dictionary, already anticipating the next story, the next verification, the next flicker of light in the underwater gloom. <words>342</words>
The city breathed, sustained by the ghosts of promises and the quiet work of a meek blacksmith. <words>357</words>
And Tiber continued, lost in the luminous regret of it all. <words>367</words>
