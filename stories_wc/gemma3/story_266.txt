Old Man Tiber, they called him, though he wasn’t old, just…bleak, a clown whose painted smile felt like a chipped tooth. <words>14</words>
He ran the ‘Ascension’ yoga studio, a preposterous affair built on a floating rock perpetually positioned to catch the dawn, just as the day’s earliest train departed below. <words>31</words>
Tiber wasn’t interested in inner peace, though; he wanted to *outshine the northern lights with a grin*, a technically absurd ambition he pursued with unsettling dedication. <words>49</words>
His method wasn’t chanting or breathing, but dismantling illusions – in private poetry, scrawled on the studio’s smooth, grey stone floor with charcoal dust. <words>67</words>
He was a master of revealing the fragile scaffolding holding up belief, a skill honed by years of watching drifting promises evaporate like morning mist. <words>84</words>
Today’s lesson wasn’t about poses, but about a clock hand, ripped from a grandfather clock years ago, that wouldn’t stop spinning, even without a mechanism. <words>103</words>
He held it aloft, the metal cold against his painted palm, explaining how it represented the relentless march of expectations, always moving, never arriving. <words>122</words>
“Each tick,” he rasped, his voice a jagged generosity, “is a vow broken, a future unfulfilled, a kindness forgotten.” <words>139</words>
A young woman, Elara, a regular, frowned, “But isn’t hope…necessary?” <words>151</words>
Tiber’s grin widened, a disturbing sight. “Hope is just a slower form of disappointment, child. A beautifully packaged drifting promise.” <words>169</words>
He began to recite a poem, his voice gaining power, describing the futility of striving, the inherent loneliness of existence, all while the clock hand whirred. <words>188</words>
The studio seemed to tilt, the floating rock shuddering slightly as if rejecting his words. <words>202</words>
Elara felt a strange pull, a desire to understand the bleakness, to embrace the absurdity. <words>214</words>
Tiber finished, the poem hanging in the air like smoke, and then, with a swift movement, he snapped the spinning clock hand in two. <words>232</words>
The sudden silence was deafening. <words>236</words>
“Sometimes,” he said, his voice softer now, “the only way to stop the spinning is to break the illusion.” <words>253</words>
He didn’t offer comfort, only a knowing look, a challenge to find meaning not in promises kept, but in the acceptance of their inevitable failure. <words>273</words>
The first rays of dawn painted the sky, pale and indifferent, failing to match the intensity of his grin. <words>289</words>
Below, the train rattled on its tracks, carrying people towards their own drifting promises, unaware of the lesson learned on the floating rock. <words>307</words>
Tiber began sweeping the charcoal dust, preparing for the next class, the next dismantling, the next poem, forever a bleak clown mastering the art of disillusion. <words>326</words>
He knew the northern lights would still shine, but for a moment, he’d felt brighter. <words>339</words>
The spinning had stopped, at least for now. <words>346</words>
