Old Man Tiber, a hesitant saboteur by trade, adjusted his spectacles as dusk bled into the harmonic resonance chamber. <words>14</words>
The last roadside vendor had packed up hours ago, leaving the plaza eerily silent, save for the subtle signs Tiber sought. <words>26</words>
He was here to judge, not with words or pronouncements, but by the rhythm of footsteps on the cobblestones – a functionally rare skill, passed down through generations of his family. <words>42</words>
His motivation wasn’t malice, but a desperate attempt to piece together a mosaic from shattered hopes, a task begun after his daughter’s disappearance. <words>59</words>
Tonight’s subject was Councilor Valerius, accused of diverting funds meant for the city’s protective wards. <words>71</words>
Tiber held the compass, a family heirloom that always pointed to home, not as a guide, but as a grounding weight against the swirling currents of deception. <words>89</words>
It didn’t reveal truth, merely anchored him to his own moral center, a necessity when wading through the lies of others. <words>106</words>
The first set of footsteps approached – brisk, confident, a clear, almost arrogant cadence. <words>118</words>
Valerius. <words>119</words>
Tiber closed his eyes, focusing solely on the sound, the slight variations in pressure, the subtle hesitations. <words>133</words>
A slight drag in the left foot, almost imperceptible, repeated every seventh step – a sign of concealed guilt, a micro-tremor betraying inner turmoil. <words>151</words>
But it wasn’t the blatant falsehoods that concerned Tiber; it was the *absence* of rhythm where empathy should have been. <words>166</words>
A true leader, even a flawed one, carried a resonance of care in their stride. <words>178</words>
Valerius’s footsteps were hollow, echoing with savage serenity, a chilling detachment. <words>191</words>
Another figure approached, slower, heavier – a guard accompanying the Councilor. <words>203</words>
The guard’s rhythm was steady, honest, a comforting counterpoint to Valerius’s fractured pace. <words>217</words>
Tiber’s hand tightened around the compass; it didn’t offer answers, only affirmed the weight of his judgment. <words>232</words>
The subtle signs didn’t lie. <words>236</words>
Valerius was guilty, not of theft, but of a deeper corruption – a loss of compassion, a severing of connection to the people he was sworn to protect. <words>256</words>
This wasn’t about funds; it was about a broken city, and Tiber, the hesitant saboteur, was tasked with acknowledging the fracture. <words>273</words>
He wouldn’t expose Valerius directly; his sabotage was quieter, a subtle unraveling of trust, a gentle nudge towards accountability. <words>291</words>
The mosaic wouldn’t be complete, not with his daughter still missing, but each judgment, each subtle act, was a shard placed with careful intention. <words>308</words>
As Valerius passed, Tiber felt a cold certainty settle over him – the rhythm of footsteps had spoken, and the city would listen, eventually. <words>326</words>
The compass remained steady, pointing towards a home that felt increasingly distant, yet undeniably present. <words>341</words>
He continued to listen, seeking the next subtle sign in the fading light, a solitary figure amidst the harmonic resonance. <words>358</words>
The work was never truly done. <words>362</words>
