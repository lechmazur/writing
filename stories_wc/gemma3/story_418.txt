Old Man Tiber’s record player sputtered, coughed, and finally fell silent, the last notes of a forgotten waltz dissolving into the perpetual whine of the radioactive dust storms that plagued the wasteland orchard. <31>
Lysandra, a headstrong mage with a reputation for impulsive spellwork, barely registered the silence; she was too focused on the stained glass box she’d unearthed from the ruins of a pre-Collapse theatre. <53>
It wasn’t the box’s intricate depictions of laughing faeries that drew her, but the faint residue clinging to its velvet lining – glitter, stubbornly clinging to the remnants of a once-sparkling costume. <78>
The orchard itself was her life’s work, a defiant splash of green and blossom against the gray, a testament to her stubborn refusal to let the world succumb to ash, motivated by a desperate need to bring color back. <106>
But color wasn’t enough, she realized, not when everyone walked around with faces as bleached as bone. <121>
She’d been tenuously certain for months about her feelings for Kaelen, the orchard’s stoic caretaker, a man who hadn’t smiled since the storms began. <141>
The glitter, she theorized, held a trace of enchantment, a forgotten spell designed to… feminize, to soften edges, to unlock hidden vulnerabilities. <162>
It was a ridiculous plan, born of merry bitterness and desperation, but Lysandra wasn’t known for her practicality. <178>
She carefully collected the glitter, mixing it into a restorative balm she usually used for blighted fruit trees, then, with a trembling hand, applied it to Kaelen’s calloused skin while he slept. <208>
The change wasn’t dramatic, not at first; a slight rounding of his jawline, a subtle flush to his cheeks, a softening in the set of his eyes. <228>
But then, he woke, and looked at her, truly *looked* at her, and a single tear traced a path through the dust on his face. <248>
“Lysandra,” he whispered, his voice unexpectedly gentle, “I… I didn’t know I could feel this way.” <265>
It wasn’t the spell, she realized, but the permission it granted, the courage to confess the emotions he’d buried beneath layers of grief and stoicism. <291>
The stained glass box hadn’t changed him, it had simply unlocked something already within, and Lysandra, finally finding her own voice, confessed her feelings in return, the orchard blooming a little brighter with each shared word. <319>
The dust storms still raged, but within the orchard’s walls, a new kind of color was taking root. <335>
A color born of vulnerability, and the bravery to be seen. <346>
