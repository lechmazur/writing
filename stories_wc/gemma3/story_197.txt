Old Man Tiber, a high-altitude con artist, lived within the boughs of the Great Whisperwind, a tree that mimicked Yggdrasil in its impossible scale, its roots plunging into realms unseen. <31>
It was during the hush after a child’s last bedtime story, when the veil between worlds thinned, that Tiber practiced his craft, a pristine chaos of whispered promises and fabricated fortunes. <53>
His current scheme involved selling fragments of dreams, specifically, the residue of where nightmares collide, to desperate souls seeking solace or power. <76>
He didn’t deal in grand visions, but in the mundanely terrifying – the feeling of being watched by porcelain dolls, the static cling of forgotten anxieties. <98>
His most valuable tool wasn’t a charm or a potion, but a piece of fabric scrap, a faded blue silk said to have been torn from the gown of a forgotten goddess of sleep. <123>
He claimed it amplified the dream-fragments, making them… palatable. <130>
But the true key to his operation lay in a peculiar method: he unscrambled a set of sticky notes rearranged daily by unseen hands, each note containing a single syllable of a cosmic lullaby. <157>
Tiber believed this lullaby, once complete, would harmonize the fractured dreamscape, allowing him to harvest nightmares with unprecedented efficiency. <178>
His motivation wasn’t greed, though; he genuinely believed a perfectly tuned lullaby could soothe the universe’s anxieties, a task he’d undertaken after a personal tragedy. <203>
Today’s arrangement was particularly vexing – “Sol-em-ni-ty… fur-ther… drift…” He traced the letters with a calloused finger, the fabric scrap warming in his palm. <226>
A new client, a shadow-thin woman named Lyra, arrived, seeking a nightmare fragment to fuel her art. <243>
“Something… unsettlingly familiar,” she rasped, her voice like dry leaves. <251>
Tiber presented her with a sliver of dream, woven with the scent of burnt sugar and regret, amplified by the silk. <271>
As Lyra paid, Tiber glanced back at the sticky notes, a new arrangement already forming. <281>
“Fur-ther… drift… Sol-em-ni-ty…” The lullaby was evolving, pulling him deeper into its intricate weave. <296>
He felt a tremor in the Whisperwind, a subtle shift in the dreamscape, and knew he was getting closer, pushing further into the heart of the colliding nightmares. <318>
The lullaby demanded completion, and Tiber, the con artist, was now its willing instrument. <331>
He continued to unscramble, driven by a hope as fragile and beautiful as the fading blue silk. <346>
