Old Man Tiber, they called him, though time meant little in the lunar mining colony of Aethel, and he was, at best, an ambivalent prophet. <words>17</words>
He spent his days, or what passed for them between heartbeats, meticulously defragmenting reality, a task he approached with happily sad resignation. <words>32</words>
His tool wasn’t code or machinery, but a collection of marbles, each one cracked like the lunar surface itself, and a rummage sale box overflowing with jigsaw puzzle edges. <words>52</words>
Tiber believed the universe operated on a cosmic scoreboard, tallying every act of kindness and cruelty, and he was determined to scramble it. <words>69</words>
He’d found the method quite by accident: aligning the puzzle edges, each tiny connection a recalibration of fate, guided by the roll of a marble across a holographic projection of the colony. <words>89</words>
“It’s all about the final oath,” he’d mutter, his voice a dry rasp echoing in the pressurized habitat, referring to the unspoken promise each soul made upon entering existence. <words>108</words>
He wasn’t trying to *fix* things, not exactly; he simply found the current arrangement…untidy. <words>119</words>
His bashful arrogance stemmed from knowing he wasn’t powerful enough to truly change anything, only to introduce delightful chaos. <words>134</words>
Today’s puzzle was particularly stubborn, a swirling nebula of blues and grays representing a miner’s lost love back on Earth. <words>150</words>
Tiber selected a crimson marble, its crack spiderwebbing across its surface, and let it fall, the impact sending a ripple through the holographic image. <words>168</words>
“A little nudge for old Man Hemlock,” he said, a faint smile playing on his lips, “Perhaps a forgotten birthday, a misplaced tool…enough to shift the balance.” <words>189</words>
He wasn’t malicious, merely…adjusting. <words>194</words>
The marbles weren’t random; each color corresponded to a specific type of cosmic debt, and the cracks represented the inherent fragility of intention. <words>212</words>
He believed that by subtly altering these debts, he could create pockets of unexpected grace, moments where the scoreboard momentarily forgot its tally. <words>231</words>
A young technician, Elara, often watched him, fascinated and slightly unnerved. <words>241</words>
“What are you doing, Old Man?” she asked one day. <words>249</words>
Tiber looked up, his eyes twinkling. “Just…tidying up the edges, child. Ensuring the universe doesn’t take itself too seriously.” <words>267</words>
He rolled another marble, a milky white one, and a section of the nebula shifted, revealing a hidden corner of the puzzle. <words>283</words>
“It’s a delicate process, you see. Between heartbeats, everything is fluid. The final oath is merely a suggestion, after all.” <words>301</words>
Elara didn’t understand, but she sensed a profound sadness beneath his playful demeanor, a weight of cosmic responsibility carried with a strangely joyful acceptance. <words>321</words>
He continued his work, the clicking of puzzle pieces and the rolling of cracked marbles the only sounds in the quiet colony, a lonely symphony of defragmentation. <words>340</words>
The cosmic scoreboard remained unscrambled, but perhaps, just perhaps, a few debts had been forgiven. <words>356</words>
And in the vast emptiness of space, that was enough. <words>364</words>
