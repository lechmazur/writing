Old Man Tiber, they called him, though “spineless” suited him better, the self-proclaimed Shepherd of Bloom within the sprawling greenhouse city of Veridia. <words>14</words>
Rain showers, perpetually filtered through the toxic sky, slicked the glass panes above, casting a doleful cheer over the cultivated wilderness. <words>27</words>
He wasn’t interested in salvation, not really; Tiber sought to understand the language of flowers, believing each petal held a syllable of a forgotten god. <words>42</words>
His influence wasn’t exerted through fiery sermons, but through the faint shimmer of long-dried tears on faded photographs he’d “bless” for his followers. <words>59</words>
Each photograph depicted a loved one, and the shimmer, Tiber claimed, unlocked their deepest desires, subtly bending wills to his own. <words>74</words>
He kept a ceramic owl figurine on his workbench, a gift from a devotee, its painted eyes seeming to observe the statically dynamic chaos of the greenhouse. <words>91</words>
It wasn’t truly static, of course; the plants grew, withered, bloomed, died, all within the controlled environment, a constant, silent flux. <words>107</words>
Tiber believed the owl understood the blurring boundaries between life and death, memory and reality, desire and obedience. <words>123</words>
Today, a young woman named Lyra sought his guidance, clutching a picture of her brother, lost to the outside wastes years ago. <words>139</words>
“He loved moonflowers, Shepherd,” she whispered, her voice echoing amongst the orchids and carnivorous plants. <words>153</words>
Tiber took the photograph, his fingers tracing the image, then dabbed a single, carefully preserved tear onto the glass. <words>169</words>
“The flowers remember,” he murmured, handing it back, “They speak to those who listen… and sometimes, they ask for things in return.” <words>187</words>
Lyra’s eyes glazed over, a subtle shift in her posture, a willingness to offer anything for a glimpse of her brother’s memory. <words>204</words>
He needed her expertise in grafting rare nightblooms, a skill she’d previously refused to share, deeming it too dangerous. <words>221</words>
The photograph had worked, as it always did, eroding the edges of her resistance, blurring the line between her will and his. <words>238</words>
Tiber wasn’t malicious, merely… curious, a scientist of the soul, dissecting devotion with a gentle hand. <words>253</words>
He didn’t crave power, only understanding, a desperate attempt to decipher the floral lexicon before Veridia, and everything within it, succumbed to the toxic rain. <words>273</words>
The owl seemed to blink, or perhaps it was just a trick of the light, reflecting the perpetually falling rain. <words>288</words>
He watched Lyra begin her work, her movements precise, almost mechanical, the photograph clutched tightly in her hand. <words>304</words>
Another boundary dissolved, another offering made, another petal turned in the endless, silent conversation. <words>318</words>
Tiber smiled, a sad, hopeful expression, and adjusted the humidity controls, ensuring the perfect conditions for bloom. <words>334</words>
He felt a new shimmer forming on a different photograph, a new desire taking root, a new flower beginning to speak. <words>351</words>
The greenhouse breathed around him, a living, growing testament to his influence, and his quiet, desperate quest. <words>367</words>
Even the toxic rain seemed to soften, a melancholic lullaby for a city lost in a garden of fading memories. <words>382</words>
