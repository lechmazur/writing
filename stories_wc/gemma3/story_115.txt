Old Man Tiber, a curious tinkerer whose workshop smelled perpetually of ozone and regret, stared at the beaked mask. <words>13</words>
It wasn’t the morbid aesthetic that bothered him, not precisely, but the weight of what it represented – a past he desperately wanted to unmake, a time between the hours of remorse and forgiveness. <words>31</words>
He lived in Aethelburg, a nano-scale city built within the ventricles of a colossal, long-dead being, a place where hopeful excavations often unearthed relics of forgotten biologies. <words>51</words>
The mask had been pulled from a petrified lung-chamber, remarkably intact, and Tiber knew, with a suspiciously straightforward certainty, that it held the key to mending things with Silas. <words>72</words>
Silas, his former partner, the one he’d betrayed over a disputed energy conduit design, now lived in the shadowed lower levels, radiating a coldness that chilled even Aethelburg’s regulated atmosphere. <words>96</words>
Tiber wasn’t interested in apologies; those felt… insufficient. <words>103</words>
He intended to *reforge* the past, not through alteration, but through a delicate weaving of interconnected wishes, channeled through the mask’s strange, porous ceramic. <words>124</words>
The process was ludicrous, even to him, relying on the city’s ambient bio-electric field and a series of precisely calibrated micro-resonators he’d built over decades. <words>147</words>
Each wish wasn’t a demand, but a gentle nudge, a possibility offered to the echoes of their shared history. <words>161</words>
He wished for Silas to remember the joy of their early collaborations, the shared thrill of discovery, the easy laughter. <words>178</words>
Then, a wish for Silas to understand, not excuse, Tiber’s ambition, the desperate need to prove himself. <words>194</words>
Another, for Silas to feel a flicker of the old camaraderie, a ghost of the bond they’d once shared. <words>210</words>
The mask hummed, the resonators pulsed, and Tiber felt a draining exhaustion, a sense of unraveling. <words>225</words>
It wasn’t about erasing the hurt, he realized with ruminative exasperation, but about adding layers of understanding, of shared experience, to the existing pain. <words>247</words>
He wished, finally, for Silas to simply *choose* forgiveness, if he could. <words>258</words>
Days blurred into weeks, measured by the dwindling energy reserves of his workshop. <words>271</words>
Then, a message, delivered by a courier drone: “Lower Levels, Sector Gamma-9. Bring the schematics.” <words>288</words>
It wasn’t an embrace, not a declaration of renewed friendship, but it was a start. <words>302</words>
Silas hadn’t said he forgave him, hadn’t even acknowledged the past, but he wanted to *work* with him again. <words>318</words>
Tiber smiled, a weary, hopeful expression. <words>324</words>
The mask, now cool and inert, sat on his workbench, a silent testament to the power of interconnected wishes and the long, slow climb from remorse towards forgiveness within the heart of a nano-scale city. <words>346</words>
Perhaps, he thought, some amends were best built, not spoken. <words>357</words>
The excavations continued, always hopeful, always searching for ways to rebuild. <words>368</words>
