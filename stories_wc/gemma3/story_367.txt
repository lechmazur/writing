Old Man Tiber, a sapped herbalist whose hands trembled more with disuse than age, spent his days during napping observing the ocean from a glass-walled observatory perched precariously on a cliff. <30> He wasn’t truly asleep, not anymore; instead, he existed in a state of fervent indifference, a carefully cultivated detachment from the aches in his bones and the dwindling of his skills. <53> His motivation wasn’t rest, but to study tide patterns, believing their ebb and flow held the key to a perfect restorative draught – a draught he knew he’d never quite achieve. <82> He’d once been renowned, but the pursuit of perfection had leeched the joy from his craft, leaving him thoughtfully thoughtless, capable of intricate calculations but unable to feel satisfaction. <111>

He’d acquired a blacksmith’s bellows, not for forging, but to mimic the ocean’s breath, hoping to isolate the subtle pressure changes that influenced the tides. <136> It sat beside his cot, a hulking iron presence in the otherwise sterile space, its leather cracked and worn. <154> He didn’t *need* it, not logically, but he’d come to cherish it, a tangible representation of his futile quest. <171> The bellows wasn’t about function anymore; it was about the *idea* of control, of imposing order on the chaotic natural world. <194> 

Today, as the waves crashed below, he noticed a lone goose flying a steady, unwavering path south. <213> He decided to measure the tide’s shift by the flight path of a lone goose, a method as arbitrary and precise as any other he’d devised. <238> Each flap of its wings corresponded to a minute of observation, each change in direction a potential anomaly in the water’s rhythm. <261> He knew it was absurd, a self-imposed ritual to fill the void where passion once resided. <279> 

The draught, he realized, wasn’t the goal; the *searching* was. <291> The price of perfection wasn’t failure, but the endless, exhausting pursuit itself, a slow erosion of the soul. <308> He continued to watch the goose, continued to pump the bellows, continued to exist in his state of fervent indifference, accepting the futility with a strange, quiet grace. <333> The observatory, the ocean, the bellows, the goose – all were merely props in a play he’d written for an audience of one, a play about the beautiful, heartbreaking cost of wanting too much. <361> He closed his eyes, not to sleep, but to simply *be*, a small, sapped figure against the vastness of the sea. <370>
