Old Man Tiber, they called him, though he hadn’t aged a day in the span of forever, was a mechanic of souls, or at least, of the machines that carried them – cars, mostly, but sometimes a broken music box, a stalled clock, even a grieving heart. <31> He resided in a subterranean orchard, a bioluminescent haven fed by an underground river of stars, a place existing outside of, and within, infinity. <54> Tiber was repulsively attractive, a paradox of rusted metal and polished chrome, of oil-stained hands and eyes that held the weight of countless untold stories. <78> His current study involved gathering fragments – not of metal, but of regret. <92>

He spent his days sorting the lost puzzle pieces scattered in the park fountain above, each shard a crystallized moment of unsaid confession, drawn up through the earth by the star-river’s currents. <119> It wasn’t the pieces themselves he sought, but the echoes clinging to their surfaces, the whispers of what *should* have been spoken. <141> He used a pair of vintage opera glasses, not to see, but to *hear* – the lenses amplifying the psychic residue, translating sorrow into audible frequencies. <166> 

Tiber’s motivation wasn’t morbid curiosity, but an exultant grief; he believed every unspoken truth deserved a witness, every regret a moment of release. <193> He wasn’t trying to fix the past, merely to acknowledge it, to give form to the formless weight that burdened so many. <214> He’d seen empires rise and fall, stars ignite and fade, all while meticulously arranging the fountain’s debris. <233> 

Today, a particularly iridescent piece caught his eye, shimmering with the lavender hue of a forgotten promise. <251> Through the opera glasses, a woman’s voice, brittle with age, confessed a lifelong love she’d never dared express, a melody of missed opportunities. <276> Tiber felt a familiar ache bloom in his chest, a bittersweet resonance with her sorrow. <291> He carefully placed the piece with others of similar tone, building a mosaic of unspoken longing. <306> The orchard pulsed with a soft, sympathetic light, the star-river murmuring its ancient understanding. <323> He knew, with the certainty of infinity, that the gathering would never truly end, and that was precisely as it should be. <342> Each fragment, each confession, was a testament to the beautiful, messy, and eternally unfinished story of existence. <361> And Tiber, the mechanic of souls, would be there to listen, forever. <374>
