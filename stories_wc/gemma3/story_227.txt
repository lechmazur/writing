Old Man Tiber, a magician dismissed as a parlor trickster, sat in the chipped plastic chair of the abandoned spaceport waiting area, feeling drainingly invigorated despite the decades of dust and disappointment. <30> He wasn’t waiting for a ship; ships hadn’t left from here in seventy years, not since the Collective took over. <46> Instead, he was waiting for zero, a countdown displayed on a flickering screen that had been stuck at ‘00:00:01’ for as long as anyone could remember. <67> Tiber believed the countdown wasn’t measuring time, but *potential*. <75> 

He held a brass microscope, its lens clouded with age, not to examine microbes, but dream symbols. <91> For years, he’d been decoding the collective unconscious, convinced the dreams of the populace held the key to the subtle uprising brewing beneath the Collective’s placid control. <114> He tracked sun patterns through the grimy, arched windows, correlating their angles with recurring motifs in the dream data – spirals, fractured mirrors, and always, a single, crimson feather. <138> The feather, he’d discovered, represented a suppressed memory of freedom. <149>

A young woman, Elara, a sanitation worker, approached, her face etched with a weary resignation that Tiber recognized. <169> She’d begun appearing in his dream analyses, a recurring figure representing the burgeoning discontent. <183> He offered her a chipped mug of synth-tea. <189> “Anything interesting in the waste streams today?” he asked, his voice a low rumble. <203> Elara shrugged. “Just the usual…broken hopes and discarded regulations.” <214> 

Tiber focused the brass microscope on a sketch Elara had absentmindedly drawn on a napkin – a spiral. <228> It matched a pattern he’d seen linked to a surge in rebellious thoughts. <242> He felt a cringe rise in his throat; the Collective’s surveillance was pervasive. <252> But the surge was growing, fueled by the shared dreamscape. <262> 

The screen flickered violently. <267> Tiber adjusted the microscope, aligning it with the sun’s ray hitting the spiral. <281> A hidden layer within the sketch revealed itself – a map, not of the spaceport, but of the Collective’s central control network. <298> The countdown remained at ‘00:00:01’, but Tiber knew, with a quiet certainty, that the final second was finally, subtly, shifting. <321> The uprising wouldn’t be a bang, but a bloom. <329> He smiled, a rebellious placidity settling over his features. <338> It was time to plant a few more crimson feathers. <348> The dream was becoming reality. <354> And he, the underdog magician, was its architect. <365>
