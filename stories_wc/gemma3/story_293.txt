Old Man Tiber, a nervous minstrel whose songs tasted of dust and regret, traced the bioluminescent veins pulsing beneath the glass walkways of Pneuma, the bacteria-powered city. <words>18</words>
He clutched a crumpled photograph, its edges softened with years of anxious handling, a faded image of a woman with eyes that promised a life he’d never dared to live. <words>33</words>
Tiber was rarely sincere in his performances, preferring to mimic joy rather than feel it, a habit born from a lifetime spent observing others from the shadows. <words>51</words>
But tonight, as the city hummed with a cautious revelry fueled by synthesized nectar and flickering bio-lights, he felt a desperate urge to escape the ordinary. <words>69</words>
The photograph was his key, a reminder of a purpose beyond strumming melancholic tunes for indifferent crowds. <words>82</words>
He’d overheard whispers in the lower levels, tales of a way out, a path beyond Pneuma’s shimmering dome, a route charted by following ancient star patterns. <words>101</words>
The timeframe was critical; he had until the last lonely candle flame in Old Man Hemlock’s workshop guttered out – Hemlock, the city’s forgotten astronomer, held the final piece of the map. <words>122</words>
Tiber knew the risks; the authorities discouraged any talk of “the outside,” deeming it a dangerous delusion. <words>134</words>
He began to deploy his plan, subtly questioning travelers, gathering fragments of celestial lore disguised within his songs. <words>149</words>
Each verse was a coded inquiry, each chord a plea for information, his usual insincerity masking a growing determination. <words>165</words>
He learned that the star patterns weren’t visible from within Pneuma’s perpetual twilight, but could be glimpsed from the abandoned observation towers on the city’s periphery. <words>186</words>
Reaching the towers meant navigating the underbelly of Pneuma, a labyrinth of fungal farms and forgotten maintenance tunnels. <words>202</words>
He bartered a rare strain of luminescent moss for a guide, a wiry scavenger named Rix, who eyed the photograph with unsettling curiosity. <words>221</words>
Rix led him through the darkness, the air thick with the scent of decay and the rhythmic pulse of the bacterial engines. <words>237</words>
Finally, they reached a tower, its glass cracked and clouded, but offering a sliver of the night sky. <words>251</words>
Tiber, ignoring Rix’s warnings, focused on the stars, aligning them with the faded markings on the photograph, a map to a life he desperately hoped existed. <words>271</words>
He wasn’t seeking glory, or riches, only a place where sincerity wasn’t a weakness, a place where a nervous minstrel could finally find his true song. <words>292</words>
As Hemlock’s candle flickered and died, Tiber felt a surge of hope, a fragile certainty that he was finally escaping, finally choosing a purpose in a world of uncertainty. <words>313</words>
He stepped towards the activation panel, ready to initiate the long-dormant launch sequence, leaving Pneuma and its manufactured joy behind. <words>332</words>
The photograph warmed in his hand, a beacon guiding him towards the unknown. <words>343</words>
