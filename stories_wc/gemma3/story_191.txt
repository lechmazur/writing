Old Man Tiber, a sober cardsharp with hands that remembered every fold and tell, stared at the cooling coffee in the chipped mug. <words>17</words>
The steam had vanished, mirroring the fading hope he’d clung to for decades, all on this mysterious island perpetually shrouded in mist. <words>31</words>
He was a boisterously quiet man, his presence a paradox of contained energy and watchful stillness, a trait honed by years spent reading opponents. <words>48</words>
His current opponent wasn’t flesh and blood, but something far stranger: the island itself, and the secrets it held. <words>62</words>
Tiber’s method for unraveling those secrets was…unconventional – he analyzed cameo appearances in strangers’ dreams, gleaned during brief, focused meditations. <words>81</words>
It was a skill he’d stumbled upon, a byproduct of his cardsharp’s intuition, and now it was the only way to dare the unimaginable. <words>97</words>
His motivation wasn’t greed, or even curiosity, but a grudging admiration for the sheer audacity of existence, the universe’s willingness to play a rigged game. <words>117</words>
He needed to find the source of the island’s power, a power that manifested as unsettlingly vivid dreams plaguing the mainland. <words>132</words>
The key, he’d learned from a fisherman’s nightmare, lay with the Collector, a recluse said to hoard memories. <words>148</words>
And the Collector, according to a baker’s fleeting dreamscape, possessed an antique ink well, crafted from obsidian and rumored to contain the island’s heart. <words>169</words>
Tiber had to hasten; the dreams were growing stronger, threatening to bleed into reality. <words>181</words>
He rose, the floorboards groaning under his weight, and adjusted the worn leather satchel containing his tools: a deck of marked cards, a silver locket, and a small, intricately carved bone die. <words>204</words>
The fisherman’s dream had shown him the path – a winding trail leading to a crumbling manor house overlooking the storm-lashed coast. <words>222</words>
As he walked, the mist swirled around him, whispering hushed pleas, fragments of forgotten memories and unrealized desires. <words>239</words>
They weren’t directed *at* him, but *through* him, a chorus of longing echoing from the island’s core. <words>254</words>
He ignored them, focusing on the faint scent of brine and decay that guided him forward. <words>265</words>
The manor house loomed, a skeletal silhouette against the grey sky. <words>275</words>
Inside, dust motes danced in the shafts of pale light, illuminating shelves crammed with forgotten artifacts. <words>290</words>
He found the Collector in a darkened study, a frail man surrounded by stacks of journals and…dreams, shimmering like captured fireflies. <words>308</words>
The ink well sat on the desk, radiating a cold, unsettling energy. <words>318</words>
“You seek the island’s heart,” the Collector rasped, his voice like dry leaves skittering across stone. <words>333</words>
Tiber didn’t bother with pleasantries; he’d learned long ago that words were often distractions. <words>347</words>
He simply laid down a single card – the Queen of Spades, marked with a subtle symbol only he could see. <words>363</words>
It was a challenge, a silent proposition: a game for the island’s fate. <words>376</words>
The Collector’s eyes, ancient and knowing, flickered with grudging admiration. <words>389</words>
He nodded, a slow, deliberate movement. <words>394</words>
The game had begun, and Tiber, the sober cardsharp, was ready to play. <words>405</words>
