Old Man Tiber, cursed to utter only truth, sat amidst the decaying grandeur of Joyland’s prize booth, binoculars trained on a flock of starlings wheeling overhead. <words>18</words>
The amusement park, long abandoned, held a layered tranquility, a stillness broken only by the creak of rusted metal and the calls of birds. <words>31</words>
He wasn’t truly bird watching; it was a pretense, a shield against unwanted conversation, though he knew his reputation preceded him – the man who couldn’t lie, and wouldn’t bother trying to be kind about it. <words>51</words>
His gaze drifted to the vintage pencil box on the counter, a chipped, floral-patterned thing, the key to his peculiar work. <words>66</words>
Tiber believed in a tapestry of fate, not one woven with kindness, but with necessary, often painful, adjustments. <words>81</words>
He’d chosen Arthur Penhaligon, a local historian stubbornly clinging to outdated theories, as his next subject. <words>95</words>
Arthur, convinced Joyland’s closure was due to financial mismanagement, refused to acknowledge the park’s…other residents. <words>111</words>
Tiber intended to provoke evolution in Arthur’s stagnant mind, and he was politely vindictive enough to enjoy the process. <words>128</words>
Each night, under the waxing and waning moon, Tiber would sketch a portion of Arthur’s likeness in the pencil box’s dust-covered interior, channeling lunar energy. <words>148</words>
The first sketch, under the new moon, showed only Arthur’s hand, stiff and clutching a faded photograph. <words>163</words>
As the moon grew, so did the portrait, and so did the subtle petrification creeping into Arthur’s being. <words>179</words>
It wasn’t a dramatic transformation; more a gradual hardening, a loss of fluidity in his movements, a greying of his spirit. <words>197</words>
“You cling to falsehoods, Arthur,” Tiber stated when the historian arrived, seeking information about the park’s original owner. <words>213</words>
Arthur, already feeling strangely rigid, scoffed, “Just rumors, old man.” <words>224</words>
Under the gibbous moon, Tiber completed the portrait, the final stroke solidifying Arthur’s jawline. <words>241</words>
Arthur froze mid-sentence, his skin taking on the cool, grey hue of weathered stone. <words>255</words>
He wasn’t entirely stone, not yet, but trapped in a perpetual, thoughtful pose, a monument to intellectual inflexibility. <words>272</words>
Tiber adjusted his binoculars, returning to the starlings. <words>281</words>
“A necessary stillness,” he murmured, the only truth anyone needed to know. <words>294</words>
The pencil box sat innocently on the counter, awaiting its next canvas, another thread in the ever-shifting tapestry. <words>311</words>
The amusement park remained silent, a haunting reminder that some minds, like abandoned rides, simply needed to be left to rest. <words>330</words>
A single starling landed on the prize booth roof, observing the petrified historian with a knowing tilt of its head. <words>347</words>
The moon, now full, cast long shadows across the decaying Joyland, illuminating the delicate balance between fate and free will. <words>360</words>
