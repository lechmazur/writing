Old Man Tiber, a brooding sculptor whose hands remembered forms more than faces, meticulously cleaned the grime from a rover wheel, the rhythmic spray of water a dull counterpoint to the silence of the impact crater research base. <words>24</words>
He wasn’t supposed to be washing vehicles; his commission – a monument to the first lunar botanist – had been indefinitely postponed, another casualty of the base’s shifting priorities. <words>39</words>
Tiber adjusted the vintage reading glasses perched on his nose, the lenses smudged with lunar dust and a lifetime of regret, and watched the swirling water, a murky tenderness settling over his features. <words>57</words>
He’d been born into service on this base, his father a geologist, his mother a hydroponics specialist, and he, destined for… something, anything but this quiet servitude. <words>74</words>
The base was a nexus of webs of intrigue, whispers of off-world contracts and suppressed data, a place where ambition festered beneath a veneer of scientific progress. <words>92</words>
Tiber knew too much, had seen too many discrepancies in the reports, overheard too many coded conversations – knowledge that made him a liability. <words>108</words>
He’d planned his escape for months, a theoretically spontaneous act disguised as a breakdown, relying on a phenomenon the scientists dismissed as atmospheric distortion. <words>126</words>
It involved the precise angle of a sunbeam, the specific density of lunar dust, and a focused intention – a way to… dissolve. <words>141</words>
Today was the day. <words>145</words>
As he rinsed the last of the soap from the rover, a particularly brilliant sunbeam pierced the dome, illuminating a swirling cloud of dust motes. <words>163</words>
Tiber focused, not on the rover, not on the base, but on the dance of dust, visualizing himself becoming one with it, a scattering of particles carried on the solar wind. <words>183</words>
He felt a strange lightness, a loosening of his form, a blurring at the edges of his vision as he stared intently into the light. <words>201</words>
The base commander, Dr. Aris Thorne, approached, a frown etching lines into his face. <words>213</words>
“Tiber, what are you doing? You’re supposed to be calibrating the seismograph.” <words>227</words>
Thorne blinked, then blinked again, staring at the spot where Tiber had been standing. <words>241</words>
The sculptor was gone. <words>245</words>
Only the faint scent of metal polish and the lingering image of vintage reading glasses reflecting the sunbeam remained, a silent testament to a life escaped via the dance of dust. <words>268</words>
Thorne checked his chronometer, a cold dread creeping into his heart; Tiber’s disappearance coincided with the arrival of the unscheduled transport from Earth. <words>288</words>
The webs of intrigue tightened, and Thorne knew, with sickening certainty, that Tiber hadn’t simply vanished – he’d taken something with him. <words>306</words>
Something very valuable. <words>310</words>
The monument, it turned out, wasn’t to a botanist, but to a cover-up. <words>326</words>
And Tiber, the quiet sculptor, had been the only one who knew the truth. <words>338</words>
He’d found his freedom, not in creating art, but in becoming a ghost. <words>352</words>
