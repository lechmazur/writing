Old Man Tiber, they called him, though “feral ranger” suited him better, stood knee-deep in a dandelion field, the yellow blooms blurring at the edges of his vision. <15> The world tasted…raw, unfiltered perception a curse and a gift since the Stillness, a time before colors truly *were*. <27> He’d arrived precisely as the midwife announced the newborn’s first cry, a fragile sound hanging in the short pause between one world and the next. <43> It was in these moments, when the veil thinned, that the randomness of existence felt most acutely, precisely random events aligning with a purpose he couldn’t name. <62> 

He held a brass balance scale, not for weighing, but for feeling the shifts in probability, the subtle tremors of fate. <76> It wasn’t magic, not exactly; it responded to the underlying code of things, a language he’d learned to decipher. <90> His motivation wasn’t to *change* fate, but to embrace the unknown with open arms, to understand the dance. <106> A crumpled receipt fluttered from his pocket, a message from a contact in the city – “Blue Heron, seven seeds” – code words indicating a disruption in the natural order. <126> 

Tiber’s hand began to quiver, a barely perceptible tremor that resonated through the scale, causing the pans to wobble. <139> The disruption wasn’t large, but it was…wrong, a forced note in the symphony of existence. <151> He’d been tracking similar anomalies for decades, receiving warnings through these seemingly innocuous receipts, each purchase a veiled communication. <168> The dandelions swayed, their delicate heads nodding as if acknowledging the imbalance. <180> 

He focused on the newborn’s cry, now strengthening, a tiny beacon of potential. <192> The child’s arrival hadn’t *caused* the disruption, but it had revealed it, amplified it. <204> Tiber wasn’t a protector, not in the traditional sense; he was a witness, a recorder, a translator of the universe’s whispers. <221> A hopeful melancholy settled over him, a bittersweet acceptance of the chaos and beauty inherent in all things. <236> The scale stilled, momentarily, then tilted again, subtly, indicating the disruption was resolving itself, fading like a dream. <255> 

He tucked the receipt back into his pocket, the message served. <263> The world remained unfiltered, chaotic, beautiful. <271> He knew more disruptions would come, more code words would arrive, more quivering hands and swaying dandelions. <288> But for now, in this field of gold, in the wake of a new life, there was a fragile peace. <304> The randomness continued, precisely as it should. <311> He smiled, a small, sad curve of his lips, and watched the mother hold her child, a tiny universe unfolding. <330> The balance, though ever-shifting, felt…right. <337> He would remain, a silent guardian of the in-between, until the next whisper arrived. <353> The dandelions offered no answers, only a golden, swaying acceptance. <364>
