Old Man Tiber, they called her, though she wasn’t old, not really, just…weathered, like the sandstone of Whisperwind Canyon, and she was the small-town librarian of Dustbowl, Nevada. <words>18</words>
She’d held the position through generations of silent watchers, each one leaving a slightly more faded photograph on the library’s “Past Librarians” wall. <words>31</words>
Tiber wasn’t interested in Dewey Decimals; she was interested in harvesting grace – the residual energy clinging to objects touched by significant moments, and the canyon was *saturated* with it, riddled with ancient carvings depicting beings who’d walked between worlds. <words>53</words>
Her current project hinged on a stolen museum artifact tag, a tiny brass rectangle detailing the provenance of a Sunstone amulet, rumored to amplify grace-harvesting tenfold. <words>72</words>
It was perfectly flawed, the etching slightly off-center, a tiny burr on the edge – imperfections that, ironically, made it a stronger conduit. <words>89</words>
Tiber’s method for gaining trust, for extracting information from the canyon’s eccentric inhabitants, was surprisingly simple: a shared love for pickled peaches. <words>108</words>
Old Man Hemlock, the self-proclaimed guardian of the western portals, had a weakness for them, and he’d reluctantly revealed the location of the Sunstone’s activation chamber. <words>128</words>
“It’s not about power, dearie,” she’d told Hemlock, offering him a jar, her tone dripping with mocking sincerity. <words>142</words>
“It’s about…legacy.” <words>145</words>
The chamber was a nexus of swirling energy, the air thick with the scent of ozone and something older, something like regret. <words>160</words>
Tiber didn’t intend to *use* the Sunstone; she intended to dismantle it, to release the concentrated grace back into the canyon, to become a legend whispered through time, not as a wielder of power, but as its liberator. <words>183</words>
The amulet’s energy felt…hungry, demanding. <words>189</words>
She carefully detached the artifact tag, its presence disrupting the amulet’s flow, causing the carvings around them to glow with an eerie light. <words>207</words>
With a small, silver tool – a peach pit carver, naturally – she began to work, not to repair, but to systematically undo the amulet’s construction, piece by piece. <words>227</words>
Each dismantled component released a wave of warmth, a sigh of relief from the canyon itself. <words>241</words>
Hemlock, watching from the portal entrance, grumbled about “meddling librarians” but offered her another jar of peaches. <words>257</words>
Tiber smiled, a genuine, if slightly unsettling, expression. <words>264</words>
The grace wasn’t hers to control, only to facilitate its return. <words>274</words>
She wasn’t seeking immortality, just a good story, a story the canyon would tell for centuries to come, a story about a librarian and a fondness for pickled peaches. <words>294</words>
And perhaps, a little bit, about a perfectly flawed woman who dared to dismantle a legend. <words>307</words>
The released energy coalesced around her, not granting power, but weaving itself into the very fabric of Whisperwind Canyon, ensuring her name would echo in the wind, a mocking sincerity carried on the breeze. <words>330</words>
She was becoming the canyon’s memory, a silent watcher herself, finally home. <words>342</words>
The taste of peaches lingered on her lips. <words>349</words>
