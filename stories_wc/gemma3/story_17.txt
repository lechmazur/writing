Old Man Tiber, they called me, though I wasn’t particularly old, just…weathered by regret, a guilt-ridden black market genealogist specializing in lost lineages. <15> My method was atypically typical: I analyzed the subtext in funeral eulogies, believing the omissions spoke louder than the praises. <31> It wasn’t about uncovering noble blood, but the quiet shames families buried with their dead, a morbid hobby born of my own. <49> I sought a path to self-forgiveness, a way to reconcile the choices that had led me to this shadowed existence. <65> 

This morning’s walk led me, as it often did, to the crumbling remains of Old Maggie’s cottage – a witch’s incantation chamber, locals whispered, though I suspected she was merely eccentric. <86> Inside, dust motes danced in the weak sunlight, illuminating a single object on a stone pedestal: a chipped bowl, unremarkable save for the faint, pulsing warmth it radiated. <106> I’d been tracking a particularly thorny lineage, the Ashtons, whose patriarch had vanished during the Great Flu, leaving behind a fortune and a legacy of whispered accusations. <128> The eulogy for his wife, delivered decades later, was a masterpiece of carefully constructed ambiguity. <143>

I began to zoom in on the phrasing, not with a magnifying glass, but with my mind, dissecting each sentence for hidden meaning, for the unspoken truths. <164> The bowl seemed to hum in response, its warmth intensifying as I focused on a single, repeated phrase: “a quiet life, lived in service.” <179> Service to whom? And at what cost? <185> The Ashtons weren’t hiding a scandal, but a sacrifice, a deliberate severing of ties to a darker past. <203> 

The chipped bowl, I realized, wasn’t a relic of magic, but a vessel for remembrance, a tangible link to a lineage on the brink of renewal. <222> Old Maggie hadn’t been casting spells, but facilitating healing, helping families confront their shadows. <238> A brazen modesty settled over me; perhaps my work wasn’t so sordid after all. <251> Perhaps, by unearthing the past, I wasn’t just profiting from grief, but offering a chance for liberation. <268> The warmth of the bowl spread through my hands, a faint echo of the forgiveness I desperately sought. <284> It wasn’t absolution, not yet, but a glimmer of hope, a promise that even broken things could be made whole again. <302> The Ashtons’ story, and perhaps my own, was far from over. <311>
