The domed vineyard, a fragile bubble of green against the ochre expanse of Xylos’ barren plain, felt less like a sanctuary and more like a gilded cage. <words>18</words>
Lord Valerius, a sneering envoy from the Obsidian Court, arrived seeking not wine, but whispers – and the faintest hope to cup starlight in mortal palms. <words>33</words>
He moved with a furiously tranquil grace, a predator assessing a dying garden, his polished boots crunching on the gravel paths. <words>49</words>
Across the hush of a possibility just born – a rumored breakthrough in stellar energy capture by the vineyard’s eccentric owner, Old Man Tiber – Valerius began to sift through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse. <words>71</words>
Tiber, they said, didn’t trust data streams, preferring the tangible weight of information, the delicate fragility of paper trails. <words>87</words>
Valerius despised paper; it implied accountability, a concept alien to the Obsidian Court. <words>98</words>
He wasn’t looking for grand pronouncements, but the minutiae, the discarded drafts, the scribbled calculations that revealed the true extent of Tiber’s success. <words>116</words>
The greenhouse air hung thick with the scent of damp earth and decaying blossoms, a melancholic perfume that irritated Valerius’ refined senses. <words>131</words>
His gloved fingers, usually adorned with rings of shadowed metal, delicately disturbed the leaf litter, searching for anything overlooked. <words>147</words>
Then, he found it: a folded note, tucked beneath a withered jasmine vine, sealed with Tiber’s peculiar wax stamp – a miniature, silver star. <words>165</words>
Unfolding it with deliberate slowness, Valerius scanned the cramped handwriting; it wasn’t equations or schematics, but a poem, a rambling destiny penned in a language he barely recognized. <words>185</words>
It spoke of resonance, of listening to the ‘song’ of the stars, of a method not of *taking* energy, but of *attracting* it. <words>202</words>
Valerius scoffed; poetry was for fools, yet the note felt…significant. <words>211</words>
He continued to sift, finding more fragments – sketches of celestial alignments, botanical diagrams annotated with strange symbols, a growing web of paper trails that defied logical analysis. <words>232</words>
Tiber hadn’t simply discovered a new energy source; he’d stumbled upon a philosophy, a way of interacting with the universe that bypassed the cold calculations of the Obsidian Court. <words>251</words>
A flicker of something akin to respect – or perhaps fear – crossed Valerius’ face. <words>261</words>
This wasn’t about power, it was about understanding, and that was a far more dangerous proposition. <words>273</words>
He carefully re-folded the note, tucking it into his coat; the paper trails would be analyzed, dissected, and ultimately, suppressed. <words>290</words>
But the image of the silver star, and the echo of Tiber’s ‘song’, lingered in his mind, a discordant note in the Obsidian Court’s carefully orchestrated silence. <words>308</words>
The vineyard, bathed in the pale light of Xylos’ twin moons, seemed to hold its breath, waiting. <words>322</words>
Valerius knew, with a chilling certainty, that this was not the end, but merely the beginning of a very long, and very complicated, unraveling. <words>341</words>
He turned to leave, the sneer returning to his lips, a fragile mask over a growing unease. <words>356</words>
The starlight, it seemed, was not so easily contained. <words>365</words>
