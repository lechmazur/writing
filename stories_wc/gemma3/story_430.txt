Old Man Tiber, a closed-off reaver known for collecting lost things and broken promises, sat on a bench in Kaleidoscope Park, the swirling, ever-shifting sculptures reflecting in his clouded eyes. <16> He hadn’t tasted the stars in a single kiss for longer than he cared to remember, a longing that fueled his peculiar obsession. <28> In his calloused hand, he held a child’s drawing on crumpled paper, a chaotic burst of color depicting a smiling sun and stick-figure family. <42> It wasn’t the art itself that held his attention, but the faint, almost invisible poems scrawled in the margins, a habit passed down through generations of Tiber’s family. <58> His grandfather, and his grandfather before him, had all used this method to nag at the universe, to subtly alter fate with carefully chosen words. <73> 

Tiber was, to those who dared look closely, charmingly grotesque – a patchwork of scars and mismatched limbs, a testament to years spent scavenging the edges of reality. <89> He’d found the drawing tucked inside a discarded music box, the poems already begun, a continuation of a pattern he recognized with a weary sigh. <106> The current verse lamented a forgotten birthday, a small betrayal before the first lie is told, a time Tiber believed held the purest form of magic. <123> He added his own lines, a mocking affection dripping from each word, twisting the child’s innocent sentiment into a plea for cosmic understanding. <139> 

“Little sun forgets the warmth it gives,” he wrote, “just as stars forget the mouths that crave.” <153> He believed these poems weren’t just nagging, but a delicate negotiation, a way to remind the universe of its obligations. <168> Each generation of Tibers had attempted to break the cycle of disappointment, to finally achieve that perfect, star-filled kiss, but always failed. <186> He watched a young couple stroll by, their hands intertwined, and a cynical smile touched his lips. <199> They hadn’t reached the age of deception yet, their eyes still holding that naive sparkle. <212> 

He continued to add to the poem, layering his own sorrow and hope onto the child’s simple drawing. <226> “Before the shadows lengthen, before trust decays, remember the taste of light in bygone days.” <242> It was a futile exercise, he knew, a generational pattern doomed to repeat itself. <255> Yet, he couldn’t stop; the act of writing, of nagging the universe, was all he had left. <269> Perhaps, just perhaps, this time the stars would listen, and he would finally taste their brilliance. <285> He smoothed the crumpled paper, a flicker of something akin to hope in his ancient eyes. <298> The kaleidoscope park continued to swirl around him, a dizzying reflection of his own fractured existence. <313> He added one final line, a desperate whisper: “A kiss, a star, a moment free from pain.” <328> The park seemed to hold its breath, then resumed its chaotic dance. <338>
