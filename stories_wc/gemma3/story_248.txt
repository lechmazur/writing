Old Man Tiber, an unsteady sentinel more accustomed to the chill of vacuum than warmth, watched the docking bay doors groan open, revealing the swirling chaos between worlds colliding. <30> He hadn’t seen a ship in cycles, not since the Convergence began, and this one…felt wrong, a splinter in the fabric of reality. <48> Dust motes danced in the sickly green light filtering from the fractured sky, illuminating the skeletal remains of long-abandoned freighters. <68> In his trembling hands, he held the strange automaton bird, its brass feathers dulled with age, a relic from a time when hope wasn’t a forgotten language. <89> It chirped, a fractured melody that echoed the coyly furious energy thrumming within Tiber himself – furious at the prophecy, furious at his role, furious at the inevitable. <113>

He’d spent decades in this forsaken bay, piecing together the truth, attempting to clear the fog of a misguided prophecy that foretold this very moment. <134> The Seers had spoken of a savior arriving with the Convergence, but Tiber knew better; the Convergence *was* the punishment. <151> He’d learned the truth not through visions, but by painstakingly reassembling shredded letters, fragments of a desperate plea from the original architect of the Convergence engine. <178> The letters revealed the engine wasn’t meant to connect worlds, but to *seal* one away, a world brimming with a power too dangerous to exist. <201>

The ship’s ramp lowered, and a figure emerged, cloaked and silent. <212> Tiber knew, with a cheerless ecstasy, that this was it – the ambush of fate unfolding precisely as predicted, yet utterly misunderstood. <234> He activated the automaton bird, its gears whirring as it took flight, circling the newcomer. <247> It wasn’t a weapon, not exactly. <251> It was a messenger, a final, desperate attempt to alter the course of events. <267> 

“I recommend you turn back,” Tiber rasped, his voice cracking with disuse. <281> “This isn’t salvation you seek, but oblivion.” <292> The figure didn’t respond, only raised a hand, and the bird, with a final, mournful chirp, dove directly into the outstretched palm, dissolving into a shower of sparks. <319> Tiber smiled, a brittle, joyless expression. <324> The prophecy would fulfill itself, but perhaps, just perhaps, understanding the truth was a victory in itself, even as the worlds tore themselves apart. <344> He was, after all, only an unsteady sentinel, witnessing the end. <355> The collision was imminent, a silent scream across the void. <364> His work was done. <368>
