Ranger Silas, a man whose enthusiasm for municipal horticulture bordered on the frantic, patrolled the urban orchard built atop the old I-95 overpass, long after the last human dream had faded into static. <words>21</words>
He believed, with a conviction that made the apple trees themselves seem to lean away, that the goddess Pomona still echoed within the grafted branches, and his duty was to *catch* her. <words>37</words>
Silas’s methods were…chaotic organization; he categorized fallen leaves by shade, measured the circumference of every peach, and documented it all in a plain notebook, convinced patterns would emerge. <words>56</words>
The orchard, a strange, green anomaly amidst the crumbling cityscape, was a place where realities seemed to fluctuate, shimmering at the edges like heat haze. <words>71</words>
He’d learned about Pomona not from any official park service training, but through chance encounters with Old Man Tiber, a former highway patrolman who claimed to remember a time *before* the forgetting. <words>93</words>
Tiber had spoken of a grandmother’s secrets, whispered down through generations of orchard keepers – secrets about the land’s true nature, and the goddess who slept within it. <words>113</words>
Silas hadn’t understood most of Tiber’s ramblings, but he’d diligently transcribed them into the notebook, alongside meticulous data on blossom drop and fruit yield. <words>132</words>
Today, a woman with eyes the color of bruised plums wandered among the plum trees, a familiarly unknown face that sent a jolt through Silas’s system. <words>151</words>
He’d never seen her before, yet she felt…resonant, like a half-remembered melody. <words>162</words>
He approached, notebook clutched to his chest, and asked her if she’d noticed any unusual growth patterns, any…vibrations. <words>179</words>
She smiled, a slow, unsettling curve of her lips, and pointed to a single, perfect apple, glowing faintly in the dappled sunlight. <words>196</words>
“My grandmother always said,” she murmured, her voice like the rustling of leaves, “that the sweetest fruit holds the strongest echoes.” <words>215</words>
Silas scribbled furiously in his notebook, the numbers and observations blurring as a strange energy began to build around them. <words>233</words>
The air thickened, the colors intensified, and the orchard seemed to breathe, the fruit on the trees beginning to pulse with a soft, inner light. <words>253</words>
He felt a presence, not a visual form, but a weight, a warmth, a sense of ancient, benevolent power. <words>268</words>
The woman was gone, vanished as silently as she’d appeared, leaving only the glowing apple and the frantic scribbles in Silas’s notebook. <words>287</words>
He stared at the apple, then at his data, realizing the patterns weren’t in the numbers, but in the spaces *between* them, in the echoes of a forgotten past. <words>307</words>
The fluctuations weren’t random; they were a response, a conversation. <words>316</words>
Silas, the overzealous ranger, finally understood: he wasn’t catching an echo, he was *listening* to one. <words>330</words>
And the goddess, it seemed, was finally answering. <words>337</words>
He continued to document, not with frantic energy, but with quiet reverence, the plain notebook now a vessel for something truly extraordinary. <words>356</words>
The orchard thrived, a testament to a grandmother’s secrets and a ranger’s unwavering, if chaotic, faith. <words>371</words>
