Old Man Tiber, a gloomy barkeep even when not behind his polished mahogany, sat perched within the skeletal remains of an abandoned carnival ticket booth. <30> The chipped paint smelled faintly of cotton candy and regret, a scent he’d grown accustomed to over decades spent observing the transient realities of others. <49> It was at the hush, that peculiar moment when a truce formed without words between day and night, that the confessions began. <68> He didn’t *seek* them, not precisely; he simply… listened, aided by a small drone he’d modified to amplify sound from the cracked receiver of the broken payphone booth nearby. <93> 

Tiber was abrasively charming, offering a gruff nod or a cynical quip to those who wandered close, but never truly engaging. <111> He collected stories, not for pleasure, but as fragments of a whole he desperately needed to rebuild. <130> Tonight’s offering came in the form of a frantic woman detailing a stolen inheritance, a worn wallet containing more than just money – it held photographs, letters, a lifetime of memories. <156> The drone whirred softly, relaying her choked sobs to Tiber’s sensitive ears. <167>

He knew this feeling, this hollowness. <173> Midnight, a being of pure shadow, had stolen something from him years ago – not an object, but the light within his own soul. <193> The confessions weren’t about the lost items themselves, but the *light* those items represented, the joy, the connection, the very essence of being. <217> Each overheard sorrow was a piece of the puzzle, a resonance that brought him closer to understanding how to reclaim what was taken. <238>

The woman finished her call, leaving the booth with slumped shoulders. <248> Tiber didn’t offer comfort, only a knowing glance. <254> He’d learned that interference rarely helped; people needed to grieve, to process, to understand the shifting nature of their own realities. <278> He adjusted the drone’s microphone, anticipating the next call, the next fragment. <288> The payphone buzzed again, a new voice, a new loss, a new glimmer of hope in Tiber’s long, silent quest. <308> He needed to gather enough light, enough resonance, to confront Midnight and finally break the endless cycle of stolen joy. <328> The carnival, even in its decay, felt like a fitting battlefield for a war waged against shadows and for the reclamation of lost luminescence. <348> He waited, the gloomy barkeep in his broken booth, listening for the echoes of a world desperately trying to remember how to shine. <368>
