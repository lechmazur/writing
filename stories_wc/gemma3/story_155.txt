Old Man Tiber, an underwater welder more comfortable with the crushing dark than open air, found himself at the Chronos Club, a broken planetarium reimagined as a nightclub, precisely at the crossing where two timelines should never meet. <30> He was patiently impatient, a lifetime spent coaxing metal to bend had instilled both qualities in equal measure. <44> He wasn’t here for the music, a thrumming bass that felt like tectonic plates shifting, but for glimpses in the vintage store mirrors scattered amongst the velvet ropes and holographic projections. <72> These weren’t ordinary mirrors; they showed fractured echoes of what *could* be, possibilities bleeding through the temporal seams. <92>

Tiber’s motivation wasn’t pleasure, but power – improbable power, the kind whispered about in the welding guilds, the ability to mend not just metal, but fractured realities. <116> He believed the key lay within a vintage button box he’d salvaged from a sunken freighter, each button a solidified moment, a potential divergence. <138> The box felt heavy with inherited mystery, passed down through generations of welders, each adding their own silent understanding. <158> He’d been told the mirrors would show him how to unlock it, how to *wield* the power within. <174>

He spotted her across the room, Lyra, the club’s owner, known for her uncanny ability to curate the perfect atmosphere of melancholic longing. <196> He needed her, not for conversation, but to pamper the mirrors, to polish them to a reflective sheen, revealing clearer glimpses. <214> He offered her a rare, luminescent deep-sea pearl, a silent trade. <225> Lyra, understanding without a word, began her work, her touch gentle, reverent. <241>

As the mirrors cleared, Tiber saw it: a fleeting image of himself, younger, holding the button box, but instead of buttons, it contained…stars. <264> A moment of unraveling, a timeline where his family hadn’t been driven to the depths, where they’d charted constellations instead of repairing pipelines. <286> He understood then – the power wasn’t about *changing* timelines, but accepting their fragility, their inevitable unraveling. <306> The box wasn’t a weapon, but a reminder. <312> He closed his eyes, a single tear tracing a path through the grime on his cheek, finally at peace with the weight of his inherited mystery. <334> The music swelled, a mournful echo of possibilities lost and found. <346> He was ready to simply *be*, a welder at the edge of forever. <358> </story>
