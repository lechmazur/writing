<story>
Elias, an apathetic summoner, barely registered the fading echo of the god’s last breath. <words>12</words>
He’d spent centuries tethered to celestial whims, and now…nothing, a quietness that suited his enthusiastically lazy nature. <words>26</words>
The shared dream recording studio, once a vibrant hub for divine narratives, felt particularly desolate, dust motes dancing in the pale light filtering through arched windows. <words>42</words>
He wasn’t interested in mourning; he was interested in coffee, and thankfully, he’d salvaged a rustic coffee grinder from a forgotten temple. <words>58</words>
It wasn’t about the caffeine, precisely, but the ritual, the grounding physicality in a world dissolving into memory. <words>72</words>
He began to unfold a plan, not of grand restoration, but of quiet, persistent work – rebuilding coral reefs, a task small enough not to require divine intervention. <words>91</words>
The motivation had come to him, oddly, not as a command, but as a whisper carried on the river wisdom of a long-dead ocean deity. <words>108</words>
She’d spoken of the reefs as the bones of the world, and their decay as a symptom of the god’s slow unraveling. <words>125</words>
The studio’s deserted hall held rows of empty frames, each once displaying a fragment of a dream, a sliver of a god’s consciousness. <words>142</words>
Elias discovered that by matching the empty frames – aligning their subtle energies – he could access residual power, enough to fuel the coral’s growth. <words>161</words>
It wasn’t summoning, not in the traditional sense; it was…resonance, a gentle sharpness of focus. <words>174</words>
He ground the beans, the rhythmic clicking a counterpoint to the silence, and began the meticulous work of frame alignment. <words>191</words>
Each matched pair pulsed with a faint, blue light, channeling energy into a small, contained ecosystem he’d built in the studio’s corner. <words>210</words>
Tiny polyps bloomed, vibrant against the grey stone, a miniature reef taking shape. <words>223</words>
He didn’t expect gratitude, or recognition, or even for anyone to notice. <words>236</words>
His apathetic exterior hid a stubborn core, a refusal to let the silence be absolute. <words>250</words>
The river wisdom hadn’t promised glory, only the quiet satisfaction of rebuilding, one polyp at a time. <words>266</words>
He continued to unfold the process, frame by frame, the coffee grinder a steady companion. <words>281</words>
The studio, once a monument to fading power, was becoming a sanctuary for nascent life. <words>296</words>
He wasn’t saving the world, he told himself, just making a small corner of it a little less empty. <words>312</words>
And that, for an enthusiastically lazy, apathetic summoner, was enough. <words>326</words>
The gentle sharpness of his focus intensified, each frame aligned a testament to quiet persistence. <words>341</words>
He found a strange peace in the methodical work, a rhythm that echoed the ebb and flow of the ocean, the pulse of the growing reef. <words>360</words>
The last breath of the god had been an ending, yes, but also an invitation – an invitation to rebuild, to resonate, to simply *be* in the quiet aftermath. <words>381</words>
He ground another batch of beans, the scent filling the hall, a small, defiant act of creation in a world steeped in loss. <words>398</words>
The coral bloomed brighter, a silent promise of renewal. <words>405</words>
