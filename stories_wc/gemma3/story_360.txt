Old Man Tiber, a necromancer of remarkably meek disposition, traced the damp stone walls of the goblin city, Gloomhaven. <words>17</words>
The sounds of goblin children – a cacophony of shrieks and thumps that oddly resembled playground laughter – echoed through the cavernous tunnels. <words>31</words>
He clutched a fountain pen with a broken nib, its silver casing tarnished with age and regret, a tool once used for grand pronouncements now fit only for sketching dust. <words>49</words>
Tiber wasn’t interested in raising armies or commanding spirits; his motivation was far more esoteric – to decode the universal riddle, the one whispered on the edges of existence. <words>67</words>
He believed the answer lay within the tangled tapestry of all things, a complex weave of cause and effect, light and shadow, life and death. <words>83</words>
His peculiar sincerity, a trait often mistaken for weakness amongst his peers, fueled his relentless pursuit. <words>96</words>
He’d learned, through years of quiet study, that the key wasn’t in grand spells or forbidden texts, but in observation, in the minute details others overlooked. <words>114</words>
Specifically, he sought to regain a lost fragment of understanding, a piece of the riddle stolen by a mischievous sprite centuries ago. <words>129</words>
The sprite hadn’t taken knowledge directly, but the *way* to access it, a specific method revealed only to Tiber’s ancestor. <words>145</words>
That method, as ludicrous as it sounded, involved deciphering the riddle through the way light reflects off a dew drop. <words>161</words>
Gloomhaven, despite its grim name, was surprisingly humid, and dewdrops clung to the phosphorescent fungi that illuminated the city. <words>178</words>
Tiber found a particularly large drop clinging to a mushroom cap, its surface shimmering with refracted light. <words>192</words>
He held the broken pen, not to write, but to use the concave curve of the nib as a lens, focusing the light. <words>207</words>
The fractured reflection wasn’t a clear image, but a series of shifting patterns, a visual echo of the tangled tapestry itself. <words>224</words>
Slowly, painstakingly, he began to see connections, threads of meaning weaving themselves into a coherent whole. <words>238</words>
The playground sounds faded into a distant hum as the riddle began to unravel, not as a definitive answer, but as a series of further questions. <words>256</words>
He realized the sprite hadn’t stolen the answer, but the *illusion* of a single answer, revealing the truth: the riddle wasn’t meant to be solved, but endlessly explored. <words>275</words>
A faint smile touched Tiber’s lips; the regaining wasn’t of knowledge, but of perspective, a quiet triumph in the heart of a goblin city. <words>292</words>
The broken pen, a symbol of imperfection, felt strangely complete in his hand. <words>303</words>
He continued to observe the dewdrop, lost in the mystic simplicity of the endless tapestry. <words>316</words>
The goblin children’s laughter, now a comforting backdrop, seemed to echo the infinite possibilities within the riddle. <words>331</words>
Tiber, the meek necromancer, had found his purpose not in dominion, but in wonder. <words>344</words>
He understood now that the journey *was* the answer, a continuous unfolding of the tangled tapestry. <words>358</words>
And in that understanding, he found a peace that transcended even the riddle itself. <words>371</words>
