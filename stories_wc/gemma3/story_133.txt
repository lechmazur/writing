Old Man Tiber, a jaded locksmith whose hands knew more about tumblers than tenderness, found himself inexplicably enrolled in a pottery class. <words>14</words>
The class was held in the labyrinth orchard atop the colonial town’s oldest buildings, a bewildering sprawl of fruit trees and clay-dusted tables overlooking cobblestone streets. <words>29</words>
He’d come not for artistic expression, but because rumors permeate the art scene – whispers of a woman, Elara, who held the key, quite literally, to preserving the old hunting methods. <words>45</words>
These weren’t hunts for sport, but ancient rituals vital to maintaining the balance of the wildlands beyond the town, a balance Tiber’s grandfather had dedicated his life to. <words>62</words>
During painting, as everyone else swirled blues and greens onto their bowls, Tiber observed Elara, her movements precise, her gaze distant. <words>78</words>
She wore delightfully menacing silver rings on every finger, and a pair of exquisitely embroidered gloves, a splash of vibrant color against the muted clay. <words>96</words>
He approached, adopting a demure audacity he hadn’t employed since courting his late wife. <words>108</words>
“Those are…remarkable gloves,” he offered, his voice raspy from years of disuse and metal filings. <words>122</words>
Elara’s eyes, the color of storm clouds, finally met his. <words>130</words>
“A gift,” she replied, her voice a low hum. “From someone who understands the weight of an unclaimed throne.” <words>146</words>
Tiber’s breath hitched; the throne wasn’t a political matter, but a metaphorical one – the leadership of the hunters, currently fractured and fading. <words>164</words>
“The methods…they’re being forgotten,” he stated, carefully avoiding direct questions about the throne. <words>177</words>
Elara smiled, a fleeting, unsettling expression. <words>184</words>
“Indeed. And some believe a new ruler would abandon them for easier paths.” <words>197</words>
She paused, then extended a gloved hand, revealing a small, intricately carved key nestled within her palm. <words>213</words>
“This unlocks a vault beneath the oldest apple tree. <words>221</words>
Inside, you’ll find the records, the rituals…everything needed to restore the balance.” <words>236</words>
Tiber accepted the key, his calloused fingers brushing against the delicate embroidery. <words>248</words>
“Why me?” he asked, genuinely surprised. <words>254</words>
“Because,” Elara said, returning to her pottery, “a locksmith understands the importance of what lies hidden, and the skill to protect it.” <words>273</words>
The key felt cold, heavy with responsibility, a tangible weight against the backdrop of the painted pottery and the sprawling orchard. <words>291</words>
He knew this was just the beginning, a delicate dance with forces he barely understood, all sparked by an encounter amidst clay and color. <words>308</words>
The fate of the hunting methods, and perhaps the wildlands themselves, now rested in the hands of a jaded locksmith and a woman with delightfully menacing rings. <words>328</words>
He glanced at the embroidered gloves, a silent promise of a battle yet to come, a throne waiting to be claimed, not by power, but by preservation. <words>348</words>
The scent of apples and wet clay filled the air, a strange and potent perfume of destiny. <words>363</words>
