<story>
In the arctic research greenhouse, where frost clung to the glass like whispered secrets, an old-fashioned mage traced the edges of a fragment from a pharaoh’s coffin, its hieroglyphs glowing faintly under his trembling fingers. <words>30</words>
The unfolding riddle of its inscriptions promised power beyond mortal grasp, yet he moved purposefully aimless, as if the answer lay not in pursuit but in surrender. <words>50</words>
Amid playground time, the laughter of distant children echoed through the sterile halls, a stark contrast to the sanctified dread thickening the air like ice. <words>65</words>
He cuddled the fragment close, its cold weight a comfort, while his reflection in the greenhouse mirrors flickered—ephemeral encounters that whispered truths he dared not face. <words>85</words>
Each reflection showed a different path: one where he claimed the uncharted frontier of the dead, another where the coffin’s curse consumed him whole. <words>100</words>
The mage’s motivation was not greed but desperation—to carve his name into the annals of the unseen before time erased him entirely. <words>115</words>
The greenhouse, a fragile bubble of warmth in the endless white, became his crucible, where the riddle’s pieces shifted like melting ice. <words>128</words>
A gust of wind rattled the glass, and for a heartbeat, his reflection reached out—not to him, but to the fragment, its fingers curling around the ancient stone. <words>145</words>
The mage recoiled, but the mirror’s grasp was real, the coffin’s fragment now half-submerged in the glass, as if the boundary between worlds had thinned. <words>160</words>
He lunged, but the reflection dissolved, leaving only his own hollow eyes staring back, the fragment gone, the riddle unsolved. <words>175</words>
Outside, the playground fell silent, the children’s voices swallowed by the howling wind, and the mage understood: the frontier was never his to claim. <words>190</words>
The dread was not in the unknown but in the knowing—that some doors, once opened, could never be closed. <words>200</words>
He pressed his palm to the glass, where frost bloomed like a curse, and whispered the final line of the riddle to his fading reflection. <words>215</words>
The greenhouse shuddered, the mirrors fracturing into a thousand shards, each holding a sliver of his soul, scattered like seeds in the wind. <words>230</words>
The fragment of the pharaoh’s coffin reappeared in his hand, warm now, its hieroglyphs rearranged into a single word: *Enough.* <words>245</words>
The mage exhaled, the weight of the uncharted frontier lifting, and for the first time, he let the aimlessness guide him—not toward power, but toward peace. <words>265</words>
As the last mirror shattered, the playground’s laughter returned, distant and pure, and the mage smiled, the riddle finally solved in surrender. <words>285</words>
The arctic wind carried the fragments of his ambition away, leaving only the greenhouse, the frost, and the quiet hum of the unseen. <words>300</words>
