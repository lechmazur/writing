<story>
The last human had been born and died, leaving only the convicted dream thief, Elias, who couldn’t count past his fingers but knew the weight of stolen memories. <words>25</words>
In the forgotten library inside a hollowed treehouse, he clutched a flimsy photo album, its pages whispering of lives he’d plucked from sleeping minds. <words>38</words>
Each face was a fragment of himself—smiles he’d borrowed, sorrows he’d worn—yet none felt whole. <words>47</words>
Elias had once loved basketball, the way the ball’s arc mirrored the dreams he’d stolen, but now the court was dust, the hoop a rusted ghost. <words>62</words>
He needed thunder, needed the sky to crack open and remind him he was real, but the world was silent, a tomb of echoes. <words>77</words>
The album’s spine split as he flipped, revealing a photo of a woman mid-jump, her fingers grazing the rim—his favorite shot, his favorite thief. <words>92</words>
She’d taught him to plunge into dreams like a free throw, all wrist and faith, but she’d vanished, leaving only this flimsy proof. <words>107</words>
Elias pressed the photo to his chest, the paper thin as the line between memory and madness. <words>117</words>
Outside, the wind howled through the treehouse’s bones, but no storm came, no thunder answered his quiet mania. <words>128</words>
He climbed to the highest shelf, where the air smelled of old glue and older lies, and hurled the album into the void below. <words>142</words>
The pages scattered like shattered dreams, and for a heartbeat, the sky flickered—lightning, or just his fractured mind. <words>155</words>
Elias plunged after them, arms outstretched, as if he could catch the pieces and stitch himself back together. <words>167</words>
The impact should have killed him, but the world was kinder to thieves than to the stolen, and he woke in the wreckage, laughing. <words>182</words>
The album was gone, but the woman’s jump shot lingered in his ribs, a phantom ache of something almost perfect. <words>196</words>
He picked up a single photo—a child’s scribble of a basketball—and tucked it into his sleeve, a relic of the last human’s dream. <words>212</words>
The sky stayed empty, but Elias grinned, his teeth sharp as the edge of a torn page. <words>222</words>
He’d coax thunder yet, even if he had to steal it from the silence. <words>230</words>
The treehouse creaked, the library sighed, and somewhere in the hollows of his mind, a ball swished through a net. <words>243</words>
Elias closed his eyes, ready to plunge again, to shatter and scatter until the fragments made sense. <words>255</words>
The last thief of dreams would not go quietly. <words>260</words>
