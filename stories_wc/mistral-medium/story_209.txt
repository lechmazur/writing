The seasoned woodsman stood in the radio wave garden, his breath fogging in the cold air as he clutched the antique hairbrush, its bristles worn but still artfully messy. <words>20</words>
He had spent years mapping abandoned railways, each rusted track a whisper of forgotten journeys, and now, during the final beep of a hospital monitor, he felt the weight of time pressing down. <words>35</words>
The woodsman’s motivation had always been to uncover the past, but today, the past felt like a ghost haunting him, its echoes trapped in the hollow metal of the water tower looming overhead. <words>48</words>
He climbed the ladder, his boots scraping against the rust, and pressed the hairbrush to the tower’s wall, measuring the echo as it bounced back—each reverberation a short-circuit of memory. <words>63</words>
The radio waves hummed around him, a despairing cheer of static and silence, as if the garden itself mourned the loss of what once was. <words>75</words>
He thought of the hospital, of the final beep that had marked the end of his father’s life, and how the old man had always told him, “Truth is the only map worth following.” <words>92</words>
The woodsman’s hands trembled as he traced the echoes, realizing the abandoned railways weren’t just paths—they were stories, and he had been too afraid to listen. <words>108</words>
The hairbrush slipped from his grip, clattering against the metal, and in that moment, he understood: he had been freed by honesty, not the kind spoken aloud, but the kind carved into the bones of the earth. <words>128</words>
He descended the tower, the radio waves now a chorus of clarity, and for the first time, the artfully messy world around him made sense. <words>142</words>
The woodsman knelt, pressing his palm to the cold ground, feeling the pulse of the abandoned railways beneath his fingers, their stories no longer lost but waiting to be told. <words>160</words>
As the sun dipped below the horizon, he pulled out his notebook, the pages filled with measurements and echoes, and began to write—not of tracks, but of the lives that had once traveled them. <words>180</words>
The despairing cheer of the radio waves softened into a lullaby, and the woodsman smiled, knowing his father would have approved. <words>193</words>
He tucked the antique hairbrush into his pocket, its bristles now a reminder that even the most tangled paths could be untangled by truth. <words>208</words>
The final beep of the hospital monitor had been an ending, but here, in the radio wave garden, it was a beginning. <words>221</words>
The woodsman walked forward, his boots crunching on the frost, the abandoned railways no longer just lines on a map but threads in a tapestry of lives. <words>237</words>
He measured the echoes one last time, not with tools, but with his heart, and found that the shortest distance between two points wasn’t a straight line—it was honesty. <words>255</words>
