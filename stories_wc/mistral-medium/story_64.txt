The uncertain alchemist clutched the cracked scale from a mythical beast, its edges still humming with forgotten power. <words>15</words>
Above him, the floating marketplace swayed gently, tethered to hot air balloons that bobbed like dandelion seeds in the twilight. <words>25</words>
He had come here to safeguard the scale, not for gold, but to map forest trails—paths only the immortal could walk. <words>35</words>
The judge’s gavel hovered, poised to strike, as the hush before the verdict thickened the air like syrup. <words>45</words>
The alchemist’s fingers traced the coded scuffs on the centuries-old marble floor, each groove a whisper of the price of immortality. <words>57</words>
The marketplace was technically wild, a place where miracles were sold alongside pickled turnips and secondhand dreams. <words>68</words>
He had seen men trade their shadows for a single breath of eternity, their forms dissolving into the mist like sugar in tea. <words>81</words>
The scale pulsed in his palm, its weight both anchor and burden, as the judge cleared his throat. <words>91</words>
The verdict would decide if the alchemist could keep the scale—or if it would be melted down, its secrets lost to the greedy and the desperate. <words>107</words>
He thought of the forest trails, how they twisted like veins through the heart of the world, leading to places where time itself grew weary. <words>123</words>
The first scuff on the marble floor was a warning: immortality was not a gift, but a debt. <words>134</words>
The second was a map, its lines drawn in the blood of those who had tried and failed. <words>144</words>
The third was a name—his own, etched by hands he could not see. <words>153</words>
The gavel fell, but the alchemist was already moving, the scale tucked against his chest, its cracks glowing faintly in the dusk. <words>167</words>
The marketplace sighed as he slipped into the crowd, another ghost chasing the mundane miracle of forever. <words>178</words>
The trails would wait, but the price would not. <words>183</words>
He had seen what immortality cost—the hollow eyes, the brittle bones, the way the wind no longer carried their names. <words>197</words>
Yet the scale burned in his pocket, a promise and a curse. <words>204</words>
The judge’s voice faded behind him, swallowed by the hum of the balloons and the murmur of the wild, floating world. <words>218</words>
The alchemist smiled, though his hands trembled. <words>223</words>
He would pay the price, but not today. <words>228</words>
The forest trails were calling, and the scale would guide him—if he dared. <words>237</words>
The marketplace drifted on, its wonders and horrors tangled like the roots of an ancient tree. <words>247</words>
And the alchemist, uncertain no longer, stepped into the hush before the next verdict. <words>257</words>
