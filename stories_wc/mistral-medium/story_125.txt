The abandoned space station control room hummed with the ghostly echoes of forgotten missions, its flickering screens casting long shadows over the underachieving mage, Elias, who lounged in a chair spun backward. <words>30</words>

He twirled a doll head with blinking eyes between his fingers, its glassy stare unsettlingly alive, a relic from a misdelivered package that had arrived that morning. <words>50</words>

Elias had always been exceptionally usual, a mage whose spells fizzled more often than they flared, but today, the doll head felt like an omen. <words>68</words>

The farmland outside the station’s cracked viewport was slated for sale by week’s end, the last tie to his family’s heritage slipping away like stardust through his fingers. <words>86</words>

He needed to reclaim it, not just the land, but the legacy of magic his ancestors had wielded with effortless grace—something he’d never managed. <words>103</words>

The doll head blinked faster, its rhythm syncing with the erratic pulse of the station’s dying systems, as if urging him to act. <words>118</words>

Elias smirked, bored excitement curling in his chest; this was his chance to spring a trap on his own limitations, to unveil the power he’d always doubted. <words>135</words>

He pressed the doll head to the control panel, its eyes glowing as it interfaced with the station’s core, unlocking a hidden cache of spells his family had left behind. <words>153</words>

The room shuddered, the air thick with the scent of ozone and old magic, as the station’s systems roared to life, responding to his touch for the first time. <words>171</words>

Elias laughed, the sound sharp and disbelieving, as the farmland’s deed materialized in a holographic display, its borders pulsing with latent energy. <words>188</words>

He reached out, fingers brushing the projection, and the land responded, the soil shifting beneath unseen forces, reclaiming itself from the hands of the buyers. <words>206</words>

The doll head’s eyes dimmed, its purpose fulfilled, as Elias stood, no longer just a mage who underachieved, but one who had finally stepped into his heritage. <words>225</words>

The station’s alarms blared, a final warning before the systems collapsed, but Elias didn’t flinch—he had what he came for. <words>240</words>

As he turned to leave, the doll head crumbled to dust in his palm, its magic spent, but the farmland outside was alive, vibrant, and his. <words>256</words>

Elias exhaled, the weight of his ancestors’ legacy settling comfortably on his shoulders, the bored excitement now a quiet certainty. <words>272</words>

The boundary of the farmland shimmered, the old magic weaving itself into the earth, a promise of what he could become. <words>287</words>

He stepped into the sunlight, the station groaning behind him, its purpose served, as he walked toward a future he’d finally claimed. <words>303</words>

The wind carried the scent of soil and possibility, and Elias smiled, knowing the trap he’d sprung wasn’t just on his limits, but on the past itself. <words>322</words>

The farmland stretched before him, no longer for sale, but his to nurture, to protect, to make extraordinary. <words>335</words>
