The hive-mind therapist adjusted the scuffed phone charger plug, its frayed wires humming with the sound of hindsight, a static whisper of regrets not yet formed. <words>20</words>
In the uniformly peculiar halls of the secret agent training facility, the walls pulsed with the weight of unspoken confessions, each brick a silent witness to the drain of human resolve. <words>38</words>
Through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes, the therapist traced the patterns of a mind unraveling, each droplet a syllable in a language only the desperate could decipher. <words>55</words>
The night air on the eve of a bold discovery carried the scent of ozone and old secrets, thick enough to taste, as if the universe itself was holding its breath. <words>72</words>
To anchor the ephemeral in reality, the therapist pressed a palm against the cold glass, watching the wax harden into jagged, accusatory lines. <words>87</words>
Merry bitterness laced their voice as they murmured, "Even the bravest among us are just echoes waiting to be heard." <words>100</words>
The facility’s hidden corridors echoed with the footsteps of trainees, their minds already half-drained by the therapist’s invasive, collective touch. <words>117</words>
The charger’s flickering light cast long shadows, each one a ghost of a decision that could have been, a life that might have been lived differently. <words>133</words>
A trainee’s voice cracked through the intercom, "What if we’re just wax, melting into shapes we never chose?" <words>148</words>
The therapist smiled, their fingers brushing the wax’s hardened edges, the coded shapes spelling out the same answer: "Then we are beautiful in our impermanence." <words>166</words>
The bold discovery loomed—a truth so sharp it could cut through the hive-mind’s carefully constructed illusions. <words>178</words>
But the night air carried more than secrets; it carried the weight of inevitability, the slow, relentless drain of time itself. <words>193</words>
The therapist’s uniform, once pristine, now bore the stains of a thousand sessions, each mark a testament to the ephemeral nature of sanity. <words>210</words>
As dawn threatened, the wax shapes glowed faintly, their coded messages dissolving into the first light, taking the sound of hindsight with them. <words>228</words>
The trainees would wake with no memory of the night’s revelations, their minds scrubbed clean by the facility’s protocols. <words>243</words>
Only the scuffed charger remained, its hum now silent, its purpose fulfilled—for the moment. <words>254</words>
The therapist exhaled, their breath fogging the glass, a fleeting anchor in a world built to forget. <words>266</words>
The bold discovery would come, but not today. <words>271</words>
Today, the wax would harden anew, the hive-mind would whisper, and the sound of hindsight would wait, patient as the night. <words>287</words>
