The vapor collection facility hummed with the quiet pulse of machinery, its occasional frequent hisses blending into the rhythm of the afternoon. <words>20</words>
Dr. Elias Voss, a professional dream interpreter, stood by the control panel, his fingers tracing the crumpled invitation he’d found in his coat pocket—an invitation to a gathering he never remembered receiving. <words>38</words>
The words "by impersonating a missing person" were scrawled in the margin, a clue or a command, he wasn’t sure. <words>48</words>
His motivation had always been to rewrite the laws carved in stone, the rigid doctrines of his guild that stifled true understanding. <words>60</words>
As the facility’s pipes calcified with mineral buildup, so too had the guild’s rules hardened over centuries, choking the life from their craft. <words>74</words>
Elias adjusted his gloves, the peculiar faith of his ancestors whispering in his ears—dreams were not just messages, but living things, and he was their shepherd. <words>88</words>
The invitation’s origin was a mystery, but the timing was undeniable: during baking, when the facility’s heat made the air thick with possibility. <words>102</words>
He stepped into the mist, the vapor swirling around him like a second skin, and for a moment, he was no longer himself. <words>115</words>
The missing person’s name—Liora—flickered in his mind, a ghost of a woman who had once worked here, her dreams lost to the facility’s hunger. <words>129</words>
By impersonating her, he could walk the paths she’d walked, see what she’d seen, and perhaps unravel the truth behind the guild’s calcified laws. <words>144</words>
The quiet pulse of the machines synced with his heartbeat, guiding him deeper into the facility’s labyrinth. <words>154</words>
A dream interpreter’s work was never just about symbols; it was about breathing life into the forgotten, about rewriting the stories that had been buried. <words>169</words>
As he reached the heart of the facility, the air shimmered with the weight of unspoken truths, and Elias knew—this was where the laws would crack. <words>184</words>
The crumpled invitation fluttered from his grip, dissolving into the mist, its purpose fulfilled. <words>193</words>
He closed his eyes, letting Liora’s memories flood him, her dreams sharp and vivid, a map to the guild’s hidden flaws. <words>206</words>
The facility’s quiet pulse grew louder, a drumbeat of revelation, and Elias smiled. <words>215</words>
The laws carved in stone were not eternal; they were just waiting for someone brave enough to rewrite them. <words>226</words>
With Liora’s voice in his ears, he turned toward the light, ready to begin. <words>234</words>
The vapor curled around him like a blessing, and for the first time, the future felt malleable. <words>244</words>
He took a breath, stepped forward, and the world shifted. <words>250</words>
The guild’s rules would not calcify forever. <words>254</words>
Not if he had anything to say about it. <words>258</words>
