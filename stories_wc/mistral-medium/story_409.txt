The sculptor’s chisel struck marble, and Elias flinched, his bruised knuckles tightening around the clay pot shard in his pocket. <words>20</words>
The inscription on it—*Stand, even when you fall*—mocked him as he climbed the attic stairs, each step kicking up dust that clung to his sweat. <words>35</words>
The attic was a graveyard of clockwork animals, their gears frozen mid-motion, their glass eyes watching as he stumbled over a rusted hare. <words>48</words>
He was skillfully incompetent, a fighter who lost every match but never stopped stepping into the ring, his body a map of defeats. <words>62</words>
Tonight, he would abduct the truth from himself, through forgotten dreams buried in this attic, where his father had once carved lies into wood. <words>78</words>
The chisel’s echo was a heartbeat, syncing with the ticking of a mechanical owl whose wings had never flown. <words>90</words>
Elias pressed the shard into his palm until it drew blood, the pain sharper than the self-deception he’d carried like a shield. <words>105</words>
A clockwork fox lay broken in the corner, its tail coiled around a half-finished sculpture—a man kneeling, head bowed. <words>119</words>
His father’s last work. <words>121</words>
Elias’s breath hitched; the sculptor had never bowed, not even when the cancer took his hands. <words>132</words>
The chisel struck again, and Elias saw it now: the attic wasn’t a tomb but a cradle, where dreams waited to be reborn. <words>146</words>
He knelt, not in surrender, but to pick up the fox’s tail, its brass teeth biting into his skin. <words>158</words>
The pain was real, the blood was real, and for the first time, so was he. <words>168</words>
He stood, the shard clattering to the floor, the inscription facing up like an accusation. <words>178</words>
The clockwork animals whirred to life, their gears grinding as if waking from a long sleep. <words>190</words>
Elias didn’t run. <words>192</words>
He faced them, his fists raised, his body aching, his heart finally unburdened. <words>203</words>
The chisel struck a third time, and the marble split, revealing not a statue but a mirror. <words>215</words>
Elias saw himself—not the bruised fighter, but the man who stood for something, even when it hurt. <words>227</words>
The clockwork animals circled him, their movements a dance of recognition, not attack. <words>237</words>
He laughed, the sound raw and unbroken, as the attic’s dust settled like a benediction. <words>248</words>
The last vestige of self-deception crumbled, not with a scream, but with the quiet certainty of a chisel finding its mark. <words>263</words>
Elias walked out, leaving the shard behind, its inscription no longer needed. <words>272</words>
The sculptor’s chisel struck once more, but this time, Elias didn’t flinch. <words>281</words>
He was ready to fight, not for victory, but for the truth. <words>288</words>
And in the attic, the clockwork animals kept dancing. <words>294</words>
