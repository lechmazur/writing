The missionary walked through the glass desert, his boots crunching on the brittle shards that stretched endlessly under the pale sun. <words>18</words>
His faith had always been a fragile thing, but here, where the air hummed with the last monarch butterfly’s migration, it felt thinner than ever. <words>33</words>
In his pocket, the tarnished silver fork weighed heavy, its surface etched with patterns he didn’t understand but couldn’t ignore. <words>46</words>
He had found it buried in the sand, its tarnish capriciously consistent, as if resisting time itself. <words>56</words>
The missionary believed it was a sign, though he wasn’t sure of what—only that it whispered of something beyond the barren expanse. <words>70</words>
He had spent nights decoding the echoes of an untuned piano left behind in a ruined chapel, convinced its discordant notes held a cipher. <words>85</words>
The patterns in the echoes shifted like the desert winds, but he traced them obsessively, certain they would reveal how to become a conduit for magic. <words>103</words>
The last monarch butterfly fluttered past, its wings a flicker of orange against the glass, and he wondered if it, too, was a message. <words>119</words>
He concealed the fork in his sleeve, afraid to let it out of his sight, afraid someone—or something—might take it before he unlocked its purpose. <words>136</words>
The desert’s silence pressed in, but the piano’s echoes lingered in his mind, a ghostly melody that promised answers if he could only listen closely enough. <words>155</words>
His faith had been tested before, but never like this, never in a place where the very air seemed to doubt him. <words>169</words>
He knelt, pressing the fork into the sand, and whispered a prayer he no longer believed in, hoping the desert would answer. <words>184</words>
The wind howled, and for a moment, the piano’s echoes returned, louder, clearer—a pattern he recognized. <words>196</words>
His hands trembled as he traced the notes in the air, the fork growing warm against his skin. <words>207</words>
The butterfly circled once, then vanished over the horizon, leaving him alone with the desert’s vast, indifferent beauty. <words>222</words>
He knew then that the magic wasn’t in the fork or the echoes, but in the act of seeking, in the fragile, stubborn hope that kept him moving forward. <words>240</words>
The missionary stood, the tarnished silver fork still clutched in his hand, and walked deeper into the glass desert, his faith no longer tested but transformed. <words>256</words>
The piano’s echoes faded behind him, but the pattern remained, etched into his soul like the tarnish on the silver. <words>269</words>
He was no longer unconvinced—he was a conduit, not for magic, but for something far older, far wilder. <words>282</words>
The desert swallowed his footsteps, and the last monarch butterfly soared into the endless sky. <words>292</words>
