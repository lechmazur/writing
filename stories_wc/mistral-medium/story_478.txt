<story>
The midwife moved through the orchard island, her fingers brushing the pressed herbs tucked into her belt, their scent sharp under the waxing moon’s glow. <words>20</words>
She had always been openly secretive, her knowledge a quiet currency among the island’s women, but tonight, her steps were urgent. <words>30</words>
The maelstrom swirled beyond the trees, its dissonant calm a whisper of the chaos she sought to unravel. <words>38</words>
Her memories had been stolen, not by force, but by the slow erosion of time and the half-burned diaries she had found in the fireplace. <words>50</words>
Each page held fragments—names, remedies, the faces of children she had delivered—all slipping like smoke through her grasp. <words>62</words>
She knelt beside the hearth, the embers still warm, and pressed her palm to the charred paper, willing the words to rise. <words>74</words>
The herbs in her belt pulsed as if alive, their wisdom growing with each breath she took. <words>83</words>
She had spent years tending to others, but now, she needed to transcend the role of healer and become the healed. <words>96</words>
The island’s orchards bore fruit that tasted of forgotten things, and she plucked one, its juice bitter on her tongue. <words>109</words>
The maelstrom’s pull was stronger here, its currents weaving through the trees like threads of fate. <words>122</words>
She followed them, her bare feet sinking into the damp earth, the diaries’ ashes clinging to her skin. <words>134</words>
A voice, neither hers nor the wind’s, murmured from the pages: *You were never just a midwife.* <words>145</words>
The realization struck her like the moon’s light breaking through the storm—she had been the keeper of stories, the bridge between life and memory. <words>159</words>
The herbs in her belt glowed faintly, their pressed forms unfolding into living vines that coiled around her wrists. <words>172</words>
She understood then that wisdom was not something to be recovered, but something to be grown, like the orchard’s roots twisting deep into the earth. <words>187</words>
The maelstrom’s calm deepened, its swirls forming patterns she recognized—the faces of the mothers, the cries of the newborns, the weight of her own hands guiding them into the world. <words>205</words>
She let the diaries’ ashes scatter, their half-burned truths no longer needed. <words>213</words>
The island held her, the orchard’s branches cradling her as she closed her eyes and breathed in the scent of herbs and salt and time. <words>226</words>
When she opened them again, the moon was full, and the maelstrom had stilled. <words>234</words>
Her memories were not stolen—they had simply been waiting, like seeds in the dark, for the right moment to bloom. <words>247</words>
She plucked another fruit, its sweetness now familiar, and smiled at the weight of the herbs in her belt, their wisdom no longer pressed but alive. <words>263</words>
The island drifted on, adrift no longer, and neither was she. <words>270</words>
