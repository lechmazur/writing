The dreamy poet stood in the disused railway station, its tracks swallowed by ivy, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and rust. <words>20</words>
His fingers traced the brass sundial in his pocket, its weight a reminder of time’s delicate undoing. <words>30</words>
He had always been formally rebellious, rejecting the rigid structures of society, but now he sought something more elusive. <words>40</words>
The unopened letter in his hand bore cryptic shapes in its wax seal, compelling him to decipher its meaning. <words>50</words>
The last riddle had been solved, yet the answers only deepened the mystery, pulling him toward the unremembered. <words>60</words>
The station’s silence was broken only by the whisper of wind through the broken windows, a quietly intense symphony of decay. <words>70</words>
He knew the letter held the key to standing by those forgotten, their stories buried beneath the weight of time. <words>80</words>
The sundial’s shadow crept across the platform, marking the passage of moments he could not reclaim. <words>90</words>
His heart raced as he broke the seal, the wax crumbling like the dreams of those who once waited here. <words>100</words>
The cryptic shapes resolved into names—names of the unremembered, their lives erased by history’s indifference. <words>110</words>
He read them aloud, his voice echoing through the hollow station, giving them form once more. <words>120</words>
The ivy trembled, as if the earth itself recognized the act of remembrance. <words>130</words>
The poet’s rebellion had always been against forgetting, and now he stood at the precipice of reclaiming what was lost. <words>140</words>
The sundial’s hands stilled, as if time itself paused to witness the undoing of neglect. <words>150</words>
He pressed the letter to his chest, feeling the weight of the unremembered settle into his bones. <words>160</words>
The station’s shadows deepened, but the names glowed faintly in the dim light, a quiet defiance against oblivion. <words>170</words>
He would stand by them, not as a poet, but as a witness, a keeper of the delicate threads of memory. <words>180</words>
The wind carried the names outward, weaving them into the ivy, the rust, the very air. <words>190</words>
The last riddle had been solved, but the work of remembrance was endless, a rebellion without end. <words>200</words>
He closed his eyes, letting the station’s silence fill him, knowing he was no longer alone. <words>210</words>
The sundial warmed in his palm, its brass surface reflecting the faint light of the unremembered. <words>220</words>
He would carry their names forward, a quietly intense vow against the erasure of time. <words>230</words>
The ivy curled tighter around the tracks, as if the earth itself was listening, waiting. <words>240</words>
The poet turned toward the horizon, where the last traces of daylight bled into the sky. <words>250</words>
He would not forget. <words>253</words>
