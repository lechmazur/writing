<story>
The weatherbeaten knight stood before the brass door knocker of the lighthouse prison, its jagged reef clawing at the storm-tossed waves below. <words>18</words>
His fingers traced the cold metal, each knock a grudgingly sweet echo of the life he’d left behind. <words>26</words>
Within the mirrored reflection of the tower’s glass, he saw not his face but the faces of those he’d failed to save. <words>35</words>
The lighthouse’s beam cut through the gloom, revealing a set of seemingly random items scattered across the floor—a rusted key, a child’s doll, a broken compass. <words>48</words>
He knelt, appreciating the pattern they formed: a map of his regrets, each piece a choice that had led him here. <words>58</words>
The wind howled, carrying the final cry of regret from the prisoners above, their voices tangled in the joyful agony of almost-freedom. <words>70</words>
His motivation hardened—he would hush their sorrow, even if it meant facing the impossible choice of which soul to free first. <words>82</words>
The brass knocker glowed faintly, as if sensing his resolve, and the door creaked open to reveal the tower’s spiraling stairs. <words>94</words>
Each step upward was a step deeper into the mirrored reflection of his past, where the prisoners’ faces blurred with his own. <words>107</words>
At the top, the beacon’s light pulsed like a heartbeat, illuminating the final item—a single white feather, untouched by time. <words>120</words>
He plucked it, and the lighthouse trembled, the reef below groaning as if the sea itself remembered his sins. <words>132</words>
The prisoners’ cries softened, their voices weaving into the wind, no longer a wail but a whisper of release. <words>144</words>
The knight closed his eyes, the feather dissolving in his palm, and for the first time, he felt the weight of his choices lift. <words>157</words>
The brass knocker clanged once more, but this time, it was not a summons—it was a farewell. <words>168</words>
As the lighthouse’s light dimmed, the jagged reef below crumbled into the sea, taking the prison with it. <words>181</words>
The knight stood alone on the shore, the wind now carrying only the sound of waves and the distant laughter of gulls. <words>195</words>
He turned away, the feather’s memory warm in his chest, knowing some regrets were meant to be carried, not silenced. <words>209</words>
The sun broke through the clouds, painting the horizon in gold, as if the world itself appreciated his sacrifice. <words>223</words>
He walked toward the light, the brass knocker’s echo fading behind him, a grudgingly sweet reminder of the impossible choices that had set him free. <words>239</words>
The sea sighed, the reef’s jagged bones now smooth beneath the tide, and the lighthouse’s reflection vanished from the waves forever. <words>254</words>
The knight smiled, the joyful agony of his journey finally at peace. <words>262</words>
