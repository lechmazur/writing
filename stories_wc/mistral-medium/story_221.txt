The wreck-diver ghost whisperer knelt in the abandoned carnival shooting gallery, his fingers brushing the dust from a piece of amber with an insect inside, its wings frozen mid-flutter. <words>20</words>
Between the lines of a half-written letter, he traced the words his father had left behind, the ink smudged like old regrets. <words>30</words>
This place had been their family tradition—a yearly pilgrimage to the carnival’s ruins, where the past whispered through the rusted metal and shattered glass. <words>40</words>
Tonight, though, he came alone, his heart thawing under the weight of a joyfully melancholic rebellion. <words>50</words>
The ghosts here were restless, their voices tangled in the wind, but he listened, letting their stories arouse something deep within him. <words>60</words>
He had spent too long in the shadow of his father’s legacy, diving into wrecks to speak with the dead, never daring to live. <words>70</words>
The amber glowed faintly in his palm, the insect’s trapped eternity a mirror to his own stillness. <words>80</words>
A laugh bubbled up—fleeting, reckless—as he pocketed the amber and tore the letter in half. <words>90</words>
The shooting gallery’s targets, long rotted away, seemed to watch him, their silence a challenge. <words>100</words>
He picked up a rusted pistol, its weight familiar, and fired into the dark, the sound echoing like a broken vow. <words>110</words>
The ghosts shrieked, then fell quiet, as if surprised by his defiance. <words>120</words>
His father had always said the dead needed voices, but tonight, he wanted to be heard himself. <words>130</words>
The amber warmed against his chest, the insect’s wings shimmering as if alive. <words>140</words>
He whispered to the empty gallery, “I’m stepping out,” and the wind carried his words into the night. <words>150</words>
The ghosts murmured approval, their voices weaving through the ruins like a benediction. <words>160</words>
He left the torn letter behind, its fragments fluttering like moths to the floor. <words>170</words>
Outside, the carnival’s skeletal remains stretched toward the moon, a monument to what had been and what could be. <words>180</words>
His breath came easier now, the thawing heart no longer a prisoner of the past. <words>190</words>
The amber pulsed once, bright and sure, before settling into a steady glow. <words>200</words>
He walked away, the ghosts’ whispers fading into the hum of the night. <words>210</words>
The shooting gallery stood empty, but the air thrummed with possibility. <words>220</words>
His father’s shadow lingered, but it no longer held him. <words>230</words>
The carnival’s ruins were just ruins now, their power broken by a single act of rebellion. <words>240</words>
He smiled, the joyfully melancholic weight lifting with each step. <words>250</words>
The amber’s insect seemed to flutter in his pocket, a tiny heartbeat against his skin. <words>260</words>
He would return next year, but not as the ghost whisperer—just as himself. <words>270</words>
The night wrapped around him, soft and forgiving, as he finally let himself live. <words>280</words>
