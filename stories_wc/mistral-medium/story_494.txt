The arrogant swordsman stood in the calligraphy master's courtyard, his blade gleaming under the fading light, its edge as sharp as his tongue. <words>18</words>
His gaze fell upon a faded tapestry fragment, its threads barely holding the memory of a forgotten battle, much like his own shackled potential. <words>30</words>
He had come to authorize the master’s work, but doubt gnawed at him—was he truly worthy of the title he claimed? <words>42</words>
Between breaths, the master’s voice cut through the silence, harsh yet tender, like the wind through brittle reeds. <words>52</words>
"You seek to deliver a spark where all lights have gone out," the master said, his brush hovering over parchment, "but your confidence wavers." <words>68</words>
The swordsman scoffed, though the words struck deeper than any blade, for he knew the truth—the weight of his arrogance was a chain. <words>82</words>
The master set down his brush and began a traditional song, the same one sung at every family wedding, its melody weaving through the courtyard like a ghost. <words>100</words>
The swordsman’s grip tightened on his hilt, the faded tapestry seeming to whisper of battles lost, of potential never realized. <words>115</words>
"You are not the first to stand here, doubting," the master murmured, his voice a blade of its own, honed by time. <words>128</words>
The song swelled, and for a moment, the swordsman saw himself not as a conqueror, but as a man shackled by his own pride. <words>143</words>
The master’s calligraphy danced across the page, each stroke a lesson in humility, in the beauty of restraint. <words>156</words>
The swordsman’s breath hitched—he had come to command, but now he stood, unarmed by the weight of his own doubt. <words>170</words>
The master’s song ended, and in the silence, the swordsman saw the truth: his potential was not in the blade, but in the hand that wielded it. <words>187</words>
He knelt, the faded tapestry beneath his fingers, its threads a reminder of what he could become if he let go of his arrogance. <words>202</words>
The master nodded, his eyes reflecting the last light of dusk, a spark where all else had gone dark. <words>215</words>
"You are authorized," the master said, not as a ruler, but as a guide, his voice the first true light the swordsman had known in years. <words>231</words>
The courtyard held its breath, the air thick with the weight of a moment that would change everything. <words>242</words>
The swordsman rose, his doubtfully confident heart now steady, his potential no longer shackled, but free. <words>255</words>
The master’s song lingered, a promise woven into the fabric of the night, a spark where all lights had gone out. <words>270</words>
