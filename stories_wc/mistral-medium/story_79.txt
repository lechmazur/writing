Sheriff Elias stood in the hush of the scientific poetry library, the midday lull stretching time like taffy, each second thick with the echo of quiet. <words>20</words>
His fingers traced the tarnished silver chain around his neck, its ethereally physical weight a reminder of the rebellion he’d once sworn to. <words>33</words>
The library’s shelves hummed with forgotten verses, their spines whispering of falling stars and the paths they carved across the sky. <words>45</words>
He’d spent years chasing those paths, not with a telescope, but with the stubborn belief that a single note could unravel an entire dirge. <words>58</words>
The chain had been his father’s—a man who’d bowed to the town’s dirge, who’d let the weight of silence crush him. <words>70</words>
Elias refused. <words>71</words>
He moved through the aisles, the ghostly resolve in his steps stirring dust motes into constellations. <words>80</words>
A book lay open on a table, its pages mapping the trajectories of stars that had fallen centuries ago, their light still echoing in the quiet. <words>95</words>
He pressed his palm to the page, feeling the ink’s faint pulse, the chain around his neck growing warm against his skin. <words>108</words>
The town’s dirge was a living thing, a suffocating hymn of resignation, but he’d learned to listen for the cracks in it. <words>122</words>
A single note, sharp and clear, could shatter the whole song. <words>129</words>
He followed the star’s path in the book, his breath syncing with the rhythm of the library’s suspended time. <words>142</words>
The chain’s tarnish gleamed like a promise. <words>145</words>
Outside, the town slept under the weight of its own silence, but here, in the heart of the library, he could hear the rebellion humming in the air. <words>162</words>
He closed his eyes, letting the echo of quiet fill him, letting it sharpen into something fierce. <words>174</words>
When he opened them, the chain was brighter, the tarnish burned away by the light of a star that had fallen just for him. <words>188</words>
He picked up the book, its pages whispering of the note he’d been searching for—the one that would undo the dirge. <words>201</words>
The library held its breath. <words>203</words>
Elias exhaled, and the sound was the first true note of the rebellion. <words>210</words>
The chain pulsed, the star’s path glowing beneath his fingertips, guiding him toward the moment when silence would break. <words>223</words>
He stepped forward, the echo of quiet now a drumbeat, the dirge’s cracks widening into chasms. <words>234</words>
The town would wake to a different song. <words>237</words>
He smiled, the chain’s warmth seeping into his bones, the rebellion no longer a dream but a living, breathing thing. <words>250</words>
The midday lull shattered. <words>252</words>
And in the ruins of the dirge, a single note rang out, pure and defiant. <words>260</words>
