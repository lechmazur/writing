The shaky mercenary traced the cracked mosaic floor of the collapsed cathedral, now a haven for street artists whose murals whispered of forgotten gods. <words>20</words>
His fingers brushed the chunk of amber in his pocket, the trapped spider’s legs frozen mid-sprint, a relic of a life he’d never understand. <words>35</words>
The echoing hour stretched thin as he followed the improbable rumor chains—tales of a door that led to the unknown, where the past could be rewritten. <words>48</words>
Carefully reckless, he climbed the crumbling altar, his boots kicking up dust that glittered like lost promises in the fading light. <words>60</words>
A street artist paused, her brush dripping gold, and murmured, “You won’t find peace there, only echoes.” <words>70</words>
He ignored her, driven by the improbable longing to finalize what he’d left unfinished—his brother’s name carved into the amber, a secret he’d carried too long. <words>85</words>
The cathedral’s ribs groaned as he pressed his palm to a mural of a spider weaving time, the paint still wet, still breathing. <words>98</words>
A gust of wind howled through the broken stained glass, and the amber in his pocket warmed, the spider’s legs twitching as if sensing the hour’s slow fade. <words>114</words>
The door appeared—a jagged tear in the wall, pulsing with the same gold as the artist’s paint. <words>123</words>
He stepped through, the air thick with the scent of burnt incense and something older, something hungry. <words>132</words>
The past unfolded like a map, his brother’s voice calling from the shadows, but the spider in the amber remained still, watching. <words>145</words>
“You can’t change it,” the voice said, and the mercenary’s hands shook, not from fear, but from the weight of knowing. <words>157</words>
He pulled the amber free, the spider’s legs now moving, crawling toward the light of the unknown. <words>168</words>
The door groaned shut behind him, the cathedral’s echoes swallowed by the void, and he realized—peace wasn’t in the past, but in the letting go. <words>184</words>
The street artist’s mural shifted, the spider now free, weaving a new pattern in the dust. <words>194</words>
He pocketed the empty amber, the weight lighter, the hour’s fade now a lullaby. <words>204</words>
The improbable longing remained, but it no longer clawed at him—it hummed, a quiet companion in the cathedral’s bones. <words>218</words>
As he stepped back into the haven of artists and ghosts, the rumor chains whispered his name, but he walked on, carefully reckless, toward the next unknown. <words>234</words>
The spider, now a shadow on the wall, scuttled after him, a silent promise of what lay ahead. <words>245</words>
The mercenary smiled, the past no longer a chain, but a thread in the tapestry of the cathedral’s endless stories. <words>258</words>
And as the last echo faded, he knew—some searches were never meant to end. <words>268</words>
