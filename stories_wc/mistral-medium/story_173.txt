<story>
The wandering orchardist, his hands calloused from years of grafting forgotten fruits, paused at the edge of the submerged city hall, its domed roof barely visible beneath the murky tide. <words>25</words>
He clutched a collection of dried leaves, each one a whispered secret from a different timeline, their edges brittle with the weight of infinite possibilities. <words>38</words>
The kitchen table wisdom of his ancestors had taught him that trust was the rarest currency, and his unique ability to see the threads of fate made him both sought after and feared. <words>53</words>
Beneath the water, the city hall’s grand doors groaned open, revealing a chamber where time itself seemed to fracture, offering glimpses of trade routes that had once thrived before the sea swallowed them whole. <words>74</words>
His motivation was simple: to reclaim what the multiverse had stolen, not for greed, but to restore balance to the orchards that fed the wandering souls like him. <words>91</words>
The phantom hand of a long-dead merchant brushed his shoulder, its touch cold but guiding, leading him to a ledger etched in stone, its pages detailing routes lost to time. <words>112</words>
The bittersweet grit of the moment settled in his chest—he could almost taste the salt of the sea and the dust of the orchards, two worlds colliding in his grasp. <words>129</words>
As he traced the routes with his fingers, the dried leaves in his pocket rustled, as if the very air remembered the paths he sought to revive. <words>146</words>
The city hall’s walls pulsed with the echoes of past deals, their voices a chorus of warnings and promises, urging him to choose wisely. <words>163</words>
He knew the risk—mapping these routes could unravel the delicate threads of the multiverse, but the orchards were starving, and the people needed hope. <words>182</words>
With a deep breath, he pressed his palm to the ledger, and the phantom hand tightened its grip, sealing the pact between past and future. <words>199</words>
The water around him shimmered, revealing glimpses of other versions of himself—some who had succeeded, others who had failed—but all who had tried. <words>216</words>
He chose a path, his heart steady, and the city hall’s foundations trembled as the routes began to stitch themselves back into existence. <words>232</words>
The dried leaves in his pocket crumbled to dust, their purpose fulfilled, as the first tendrils of new trade routes bloomed like vines across the multiverse. <words>249</words>
The orchardist smiled, knowing the cost of his reclamation was a life spent wandering, but the taste of fresh fruit on the tongues of the lost was worth every step. <words>269</words>
As he turned to leave, the phantom hand released him, its duty done, and the city hall sank deeper into the sea, its secrets safe once more. <words>285</words>
The surface broke above him, the sun warm on his face, and he set off toward the next horizon, his pockets empty but his soul full. <words>301</words>
Somewhere, in another timeline, a merchant would wake with a map in hand, and the cycle would begin anew. <words>314</words>
The orchardist walked on, his boots kicking up dust, the multiverse humming softly in his wake. <words>325</words>
