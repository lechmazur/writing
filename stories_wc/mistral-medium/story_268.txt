<story>
The abandoned waiting area echoed with screaming silence, its cracked tiles and peeling walls bearing the scars of a forgotten war. <words>18</words>
A subdued vigilante, known only as Elias, sat hunched over an antique funhouse mirror, its warped surface reflecting distortions he alone could decipher. <words>30</words>
His fingers traced the edge of a plain wooden bead, a relic from a master of an ancient art he sought to reclaim. <words>40</words>
During virtual calls, he flattered his contacts with artfully clumsy praise, masking his true intent—tracking the bead’s origins. <words>52</words>
Each call was a thread in a web of lies, woven to uncover the price of war paid by those who came before him. <words>64</words>
The mirror’s distortions pulsed like a heartbeat, revealing fragments of a past where the bead had been a weapon, not a trinket. <words>77</words>
Elias’s hands trembled as he pieced together the truth: the bead’s creator had sacrificed everything to master the art, leaving only silence in his wake. <words>92</words>
The vigilante’s motivation hardened—he would not repeat the same fate, but he would honor it. <words>102</words>
In the mirror’s depths, he saw the waiting area as it once was, filled with soldiers who had vanished into the war’s maw. <words>116</words>
Their ghosts whispered warnings, but Elias pressed on, his clumsy charm now a blade to cut through deception. <words>128</words>
The bead warmed in his palm, its plainness a lie, its power a secret buried in blood and time. <words>139</words>
He knew the final step: to master the art, he must surrender something irreplaceable, just as the master had. <words>152</words>
The mirror’s distortions twisted into a single, screaming face—his own, stripped of all pretense. <words>162</words>
Elias clenched the bead and whispered the ancient words, sealing his fate. <words>170</words>
The waiting area shuddered, the walls weeping dust as the art consumed him, leaving only the bead and the silence behind. <words>184</words>
When the next virtual call connected, his voice was steady, his praise flawless, but his eyes held the weight of the price he’d paid. <words>199</words>
The war’s cost was no longer a lesson—it was his legacy. <words>205</words>
And in the mirror’s fractured glass, the vigilante’s reflection smiled, artfully, clumsily, eternally. <words>215</words>
The abandoned waiting area stood witness, its silence now a monument to the war’s unending toll. <words>225</words>
Elias’s hands, once trembling, were still, the bead’s power humming through his veins like a second pulse. <words>236</words>
He had mastered the art, but the price was carved into his bones, a debt paid in echoes and absence. <words>248</words>
The mirror’s distortions faded, leaving only the truth: war never ends, it only changes shape. <words>260</words>
And Elias, the subdued vigilante, was its newest vessel. <words>266</words>
