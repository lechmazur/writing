Father Elias, a lapsed priest with unapologetically confused eyes, clutched an abacus with missing beads as he jogged through the labyrinth orchard of giant bean stalks reaching the clouds. <words>25</words>
The beads’ absence mirrored his fractured faith, each gap a reminder of the price of complacency he’d paid by abandoning his vows. <words>38</words>
The orchard’s towering stalks swayed in the hush of fate unraveling, their rustling leaves whispering secrets he no longer understood. <words>50</words>
He moved by following snow patterns—delicate, fleeting—traced across the earth, as if the frost itself plotted his path beyond fate’s design. <words>65</words>
The dull radiance of the winter sun cast long shadows, stretching his doubt into the soil where the beans had sprouted from forgotten prayers. <words>80</words>
His breath came in ragged bursts, each step a defiance, though he wasn’t sure against what—God, himself, or the orchard’s silent judgment. <words>95</words>
The abacus clicked in his palm, its broken rhythm a counter to the chaos in his mind, the missing beads like lost souls he’d failed to guide. <words>110</words>
A gust of wind sent snow swirling, and for a moment, the patterns vanished, leaving him blind in the maze of his own making. <words>125</words>
He stumbled, fingers brushing a stalk’s rough bark, its height mocking his smallness, his futile jog toward something he couldn’t name. <words>140</words>
The orchard had no center, no end—just the endless climb of beans toward a sky that offered no answers, only the weight of its indifference. <words>155</words>
Father Elias laughed, the sound swallowed by the stalks, his confusion unapologetic, his defiance a whisper lost in the hush of fate unraveling. <words>170</words>
He dropped the abacus, its beads scattering like the remnants of his conviction, and pressed on, the snow patterns reforming ahead, a path not of salvation but of stubborn persistence. <words>185</words>
The orchard’s labyrinth was his penance, its stalks the bars of a prison he’d chosen, yet still he ran, as if motion alone could outpace regret. <words>200</words>
The dull radiance faded as dusk crept in, the bean stalks darkening into silhouettes of his past, their roots tangled in the soil of his complacency. <words>215</words>
He paused, chest heaving, and listened—the orchard held its breath, waiting to see if he’d finally stop or keep running toward nothing. <words>230</words>
The snow patterns shifted, leading him deeper, and with a sigh, he followed, the price of his choices etched into every step. <words>245</words>
The abacus lay abandoned, its missing beads a testament to the faith he’d lost, the path he’d chosen, and the fate he still dared to defy. <words>260</words>
