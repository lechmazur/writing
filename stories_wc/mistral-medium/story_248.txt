The unsteady sentinel stood in the abandoned space freighter docking bay, his breath fogging the cold air as he clutched the strange automaton bird in his trembling hands. <words>20</words>
Its gears whirred coyly furious, as if sensing the ambush of fate lurking between worlds colliding just beyond the shattered viewport. <words>30</words>
He had been drawn here by the misguided prophecy, its words still echoing in his mind like a curse. <words>39</words>
The sentinel’s fingers traced the bird’s metallic feathers, its hollow eyes reflecting the dim glow of dying stars. <words>48</words>
He knew he had to clear the fog of its meaning, to unravel the truth before the collision consumed them all. <words>58</words>
With a shudder, he began reassembling shredded letters scattered across the docking bay floor, each fragment a clue. <words>68</words>
The automaton bird watched, its beak clicking in approval as the pieces formed a single, damning recommendation. <words>78</words>
The sentinel’s heart pounded—he had been wrong, so terribly wrong. <words>84</words>
The prophecy wasn’t a warning; it was a trap, a cruel joke played by the cosmos. <words>93</words>
The bird’s wings fluttered, its voice a whisper of static: *"You were never meant to understand."* <words>103</words>
He wanted to scream, to rage against the cheerless ecstasy of revelation, but the docking bay swallowed his voice. <words>114</words>
The walls groaned as the worlds outside drew closer, their gravity pulling at the freighter like a predator’s jaws. <words>124</words>
The sentinel clutched the bird tighter, its metal warm against his skin, the only anchor in the storm. <words>134</words>
He had to act, to do something—anything—but the weight of the truth paralyzed him. <words>143</words>
The automaton bird tilted its head, its gaze piercing. *"Recommend,"* it urged, *"or be consumed."* <words>151</words>
The sentinel’s hands moved on their own, piecing together the final fragments of the prophecy’s lie. <words>160</words>
The truth was a blade, and he was its wielder now. <words>165</words>
The docking bay trembled as the collision neared, the air thick with the scent of ozone and rust. <words>175</words>
He whispered the recommendation to the void, his voice lost in the chaos. <words>182</words>
The automaton bird took flight, its wings cutting through the gloom like a promise. <words>190</words>
The sentinel watched it go, knowing he had done all he could. <words>197</words>
The worlds collided, and in the silence that followed, he smiled—a bitter, broken thing. <words>206</words>
The fog had cleared, but the cost was everything. <words>211</words>
The docking bay was still, the only sound the faint hum of the automaton bird’s distant song. <words>221</words>
He sank to his knees, the weight of the truth finally crushing him. <words>228</words>
The prophecy was dead, but so was he. <words>232</words>
The bird’s shadow passed over him one last time before vanishing into the dark. <words>240</words>
The sentinel closed his eyes, the ambush of fate complete. <words>246</words>
