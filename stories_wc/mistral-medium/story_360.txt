In the underground city of the goblins, where the air hummed with the echoes of playground sounds, a meek necromancer sat hunched over a tangled tapestry, his fingers tracing the threads as if they held the answers to a universal riddle. <words>30</words>
His fountain pen, its nib broken, lay beside him, ink seeping into the fabric like whispers of forgotten secrets. <words>40</words>
He was peculiarly sincere in his pursuit, believing that the way light reflected off a dew drop could reveal the truth he sought. <words>55</words>
The goblins, with their mischievous laughter, paid him no mind, for they knew the weight of his quest was beyond their understanding. <words>68</words>
The tapestry, woven with threads of time and fate, seemed to shift beneath his touch, as if alive with the stories of those who had come before. <words>83</words>
He longed to regain what had been lost—not power, not glory, but the simple clarity of purpose that had once guided his hands. <words>98</words>
As he studied the dew clinging to the cavern walls, he noticed how the light bent and fractured, casting prismatic shadows onto the tapestry. <words>114</words>
Each droplet held a fragment of the riddle, and he realized that the answer was not in the threads themselves, but in the spaces between them. <words>129</words>
With a trembling hand, he dipped his broken pen into the dew, letting the ink mingle with the water, and began to trace the reflections onto the fabric. <words>145</words>
The goblins’ laughter faded as the tapestry shimmered, revealing a pattern that had been hidden in plain sight. <words>157</words>
The necromancer’s breath caught—he saw the riddle unraveling, not as a question to be answered, but as a truth to be lived. <words>171</words>
The light from the dew drops wove into the threads, and for the first time, he understood that the tangled mess was not chaos, but a map of connections. <words>188</words>
He had spent his life seeking to control the unseen, but now he saw that the real magic lay in surrendering to the flow of existence. <words>204</words>
As the last of the dew evaporated, the tapestry settled, its patterns clear, and the necromancer smiled, his heart lighter than it had been in years. <words>221</words>
The goblins, sensing the shift, crept closer, their eyes wide with curiosity, but he only shook his head, his fingers brushing the now-dry threads. <words>238</words>
The riddle was not solved, but it no longer needed to be—he had regained the one thing he had lost: the courage to let go. <words>254</words>
And as the playground sounds swelled around him, he folded the tapestry gently, knowing that the answers he sought had always been within the light. <words>269</words>
