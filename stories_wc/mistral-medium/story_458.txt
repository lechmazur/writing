<story>
The pilot of the flying library, a spiritually secular woman with ink-stained fingers, landed her ship in the abandoned spaceport baggage claim, where the air hummed with fractal sorrow. <words>25</words>
She clutched a detached coat button, the last remnant of her mentor’s uniform, its threads frayed like the tradition she was desperate to preserve. <words>40</words>
In the second before the conveyor belt groaned to life, she knew a simple yes or no would change everything—her mission, her past, the future of the library itself. <words>58</words>
The button glinted under the flickering lights as she pressed it into the coffee stains on her sleeve, reading the future in their chaotic swirls. <words>72</words>
The stains whispered of a bridge to unity, a path hidden in the forgotten cargo of the spaceport, where books and memories lay entangled. <words>87</words>
She moved swiftly, her boots echoing against the cracked tiles, her heart pounding with the weight of what she must obliterate to save. <words>102</words>
A single book, bound in cracked leather, pulsed with the energy of a thousand voices—it was the key, the bridge, the threat. <words>117</words>
Her fingers trembled as she traced the coffee stains again, the future darkening with each possible path. <words>128</words>
The library’s engines whined, a plea or a warning, but she had no time for doubt. <words>137</words>
With a breath, she tore the book from its shelf, the pages flaring like embers as she whispered the words to unmake it. <words>150</words>
The spaceport shuddered, the conveyor belts twisting into knots, the air thick with the scent of burning parchment and ozone. <words>163</words>
The button in her palm grew warm, then searing, as the bridge to unity collapsed into ash. <words>174</words>
She stood in the silence, the weight of her choice pressing down like the gravity of a dying star. <words>184</words>
The library’s wings unfurled, ready to carry her away, but the sorrow remained, fractal and endless. <words>195</words>
She tucked the button into her pocket, a relic of what was lost, and what she had saved. <words>206</words>
The coffee stains on her sleeve had faded, the future now a blank page, waiting for her to write it anew. <words>219</words>
As the ship lifted into the void, she wondered if unity had ever been possible, or if it had always been a story told in the margins. <words>235</words>
The baggage claim faded behind her, a tomb of forgotten things, but the library flew on, a beacon in the dark. <words>248</words>
She would return, she decided, to the places where tradition still breathed, where a simple yes or no could change everything. <words>264</words>
And perhaps, one day, the bridge would rise again. <words>270</words>
