The forgotten recipe library smelled of dust and regret, its shelves sagging under the weight of yellowed pages no one bothered to read anymore. <words>20</words>
Elias, the reincarnated goldfish caretaker, traced a finger along the spines, his tentatively fierce heart aching for something he couldn’t name. <words>32</words>
A toy soldier with a missing arm lay abandoned on a windowsill, its paint chipped from years of neglect, as if even the toys had given up on tradition. <words>44</words>
Elias picked it up, the weight of guilt’s haunting echo pressing against his ribs—he’d been the one to break it, decades ago, in a fit of childish rage. <words>58</words>
Outside, the sky darkened suddenly, rain lashing against the glass, and he laughed, a bitter sound, because of course the weather would turn now, before the doctor’s chart confirmed what he already knew. <words>76</words>
A woman stumbled in, soaked, her eyes sharp with playful cynicism as she shook water from her coat. <words>85</words>
"You look like you’re trying to solve the world’s problems with a broken toy," she said, nodding at the soldier. <words>95</words>
Elias clenched it tighter. "Maybe I am." <words>98</words>
She smirked. "Tradition’s overrated." <words>101</words>
The words hit like a punch—he’d spent lifetimes upholding stagnant rituals, feeding goldfish that died and returned, just like him, trapped in cycles. <words>118</words>
The woman pulled a crumbling recipe from her pocket, its edges singed. "Burned it on purpose," she admitted. "Some things shouldn’t be repeated." <words>131</words>
Elias stared at the soldier, then at her, and for the first time in centuries, he wanted to disrupt, to alleviate, to break free. <words>143</words>
The rain slowed, sunlight slicing through the clouds like a promise. <words>149</words>
He tossed the toy soldier into the storm, watching it vanish in the downpour. <words>157</words>
The woman laughed, low and knowing. "Took you long enough." <words>162</words>
Elias exhaled, lighter, as if the missing arm had been his own. <words>168</words>
The doctor’s chart could wait. <words>171</words>
For now, there was only the rain, the woman, and the first page of a new recipe—one he’d write himself. <words>182</words>
She grinned. "You’re not as fierce as you think." <words>187</words>
"Tentatively," he corrected, and she laughed again, the sound bright against the storm’s fading growl. <words>197</words>
The library creaked around them, its forgotten weight lifting, just a little. <words>204</words>
Elias reached for her hand, the guilt still there but softer now, like an old scar. <words>213</words>
The goldfish in their bowls back home would keep circling, but he wouldn’t. <words>220</words>
The woman squeezed his fingers. "About time." <words>223</words>
The rain stopped. <words>225</words>
The recipe began. <words>227</words>
And for the first time, Elias didn’t feel like a caretaker of the past. <words>234</words>
He felt like the storm—sudden, necessary, free. <words>239</words>
The woman winked. "Now what?" <words>242</words>
Elias smiled. "Now we cook." <words>245</words>
