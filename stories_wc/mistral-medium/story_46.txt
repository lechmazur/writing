The blank-faced performer stood in the orchard of giant ferns, their features as smooth and unreadable as the plain plastic ring they twisted around their finger. <words>20</words>
Waterfalls roared in the distance, drowning out the delicate notes of their piano practice, which they played with a precision that bordered on madness. <words>35</words>
They were the guardian of rumors, a role as uniquely typical as the ferns that swayed around them, whispering secrets only they could decipher. <words>48</words>
Their motivation was singular: to learn the language of dreams, a pursuit that required them to approve or discard the truths hidden in the murmurs of the night. <words>63</words>
By tracking moon paths, they mapped the trajectories of these whispers, their blank face a canvas for the stories they collected. <words>75</words>
The plastic ring was their tool, a conduit that hummed when pressed against the ferns, translating the rustling into fragments of forgotten conversations. <words>90</words>
One evening, as the waterfalls glowed silver under the moon, the performer paused their piano practice, their fingers hovering over the keys. <words>105</words>
A rumor had surfaced—one that spoke of a dream language so pure it could rewrite reality. <words>115</words>
Their heart quickened, but their face remained still, betraying nothing. <words>122</words>
They slipped the ring onto a fern, and the plant shuddered, its leaves curling into symbols that only they could read. <words>135</words>
The symbols formed a path, one that wound through the orchard and beyond, where the waterfalls cascaded into a hidden grove. <words>148</words>
They followed, their steps light, their mind alight with the possibility of finally understanding the language they had sought for so long. <words>163</words>
But as they neared the grove, the piano notes from their earlier practice echoed back to them, twisted and wrong. <words>175</words>
The rumors had lied. <words>177</words>
The dream language was not a gift but a curse, a madness that would consume anyone who dared to speak it. <words>190</words>
With a slow, deliberate motion, they removed the ring and let it fall into the fern’s embrace. <words>201</words>
The plant withered instantly, its secrets dying with it. <words>207</words>
The performer returned to their piano, their blank face now carrying the weight of a truth they would never share. <words>220</words>
The waterfalls roared on, the ferns swayed, and the moon tracked its path across the sky, indifferent to the guardian’s silent approval of the world’s chaos. <words>238</words>
They played a single, perfect note, then another, weaving a new rumor into the air—one that only the ferns would remember. <words>254</words>
And in that precise madness, they found a kind of peace. <words>260</words>
