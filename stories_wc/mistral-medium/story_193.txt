<story>
The exiled prince, his cloak heavy with the weight of forgotten titles, stumbled into the abandoned customs office as the first flakes of a sudden snowstorm began to fall. <words>20</words>
Dust swirled around the antique mortar and pestle left on a cracked wooden table, their surfaces worn smooth by time and unseen forces. <words>30</words>
He traced a finger along the mortar’s edge, its curves unintentionally iconic, as if carved by hands that knew more than they revealed. <words>40</words>
The turn of a key in the office’s rusted lock echoed like a sigh, sealing away the past—or so he hoped. <words>50</words>
But the storm outside raged harder, trapping him in the familiar unknown, where shadows whispered of cures for loneliness. <words>60</words>
A figure emerged from the blizzard, their face obscured by a hood, clutching a vial of shimmering liquid. <words>70</words>
“You seek to improve,” they said, voice like wind through hollow bones, “but improvement is not always the answer.” <words>80</words>
The prince’s breath hitched as the stranger placed the vial beside the mortar, the liquid pulsing with unseen energy. <words>90</words>
“Grind the past,” they murmured, “and you may find what you’ve lost.” <words>100</words>
His hands trembled as he lifted the pestle, the weight of his exile pressing down like the storm outside. <words>110</words>
The first strike sent a ripple through the air, the mortar glowing faintly, as if awakening. <words>120</words>
Memories swirled like snow—his father’s disapproval, the throne he’d never reclaim, the faces of those who’d turned away. <words>130</words>
With each grind, the liquid in the vial darkened, thickening into something viscous and alive. <words>140</words>
The stranger watched, their presence both a comfort and a warning, as the prince’s loneliness took shape in the mortar. <words>150</words>
“This is not a cure,” the prince realized, voice raw, “but a mirror.” <words>160</words>
The storm howled, the office creaking under its weight, as the liquid spilled over, forming a figure—his own reflection, but older, wiser. <words>170</words>
“You are not alone,” the reflection whispered, “because you carry the past with you.” <words>180</words>
The prince reached out, his fingers passing through the image, the cold of the storm seeping into his bones. <words>190</words>
The stranger was gone when he turned, leaving only the mortar, now empty, and the key in the lock, turned back to its starting point. <words>200</words>
The snowstorm eased, the world outside quiet and still, as if the unseen forces had finally settled. <words>210</words>
He pocketed the key, the mortar’s weight lighter now, its purpose fulfilled. <words>220</words>
The abandoned customs office no longer felt like a prison, but a threshold, a place where past and future blurred. <words>230</words>
As he stepped into the snow, the prince understood—lononeliness was not an absence, but a shape he could learn to hold. <words>240</words>
The storm had given him a chance encounter, not with another, but with himself. <words>250</words>
And for the first time, the weight of his exile felt like something he could carry. <words>260</words>
