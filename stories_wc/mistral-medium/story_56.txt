The frozen computer screen flickered to life just as Elias, the bluffing swindler, dropped his book onto the reclaimed orchard farmland inside the toppled skyscraper. <words>20</words>
The pages scattered, revealing a blank price tag tucked between them, its emptiness a silent accusation. <words>30</words>
Elias sighed, his energetically lethargic demeanor masking the weight of the truth he carried—one no one dared to handle. <words>40</words>
A woman knelt beside him, her fingers brushing the tag as if it were a relic. <words>48</words>
"You dropped this," she said, her voice a gentle harshness that cut through the ruins' quiet. <words>58</words>
Elias smirked, magnetizing her attention with practiced ease, though his usual charm felt hollow here. <words>68</words>
The orchard’s twisted vines curled around rusted beams, a testament to nature’s stubborn reclamation. <words>78</words>
She studied him, her gaze sharp enough to peel back his layers. <words>85</words>
"You’re not here to buy anything," she said, plucking an apple from a gnarled branch. <words>95</words>
Elias hesitated, the weight of his invisible allies—ghosts of past cons—pressing against his ribs. <words>105</words>
The computer’s restart hummed in the background, a mechanical heartbeat counting down to confession. <words>115</words>
He reached for the tag, but she held it just out of reach, her smile knowing. <words>125</words>
"Truth’s a rare currency," she murmured, and Elias felt the ground tilt beneath him. <words>135</words>
The skyscraper’s bones groaned, as if the ruins themselves were listening. <words>142</words>
He exhaled, the bluff crumbling. <words>145</words>
"I stole it," he admitted, nodding at the tag. <words>150</words>
"Not the tag," she said, her voice softer now. <words>156</words>
"The orchard." <words>158</words>
Elias’s laugh was a brittle thing. <words>161</words>
The computer’s screen glowed brighter, casting long shadows over the vines. <words>169</words>
She handed him the tag, its blankness now a canvas for something honest. <words>178</words>
"Start there," she said, and Elias realized the meet-cute had been a trap—one he’d walked into willingly. <words>190</words>
The orchard’s air thickened with possibility, the weight of his past suddenly lighter. <words>199</words>
He scribbled a number on the tag, the first truth he’d ever sold. <words>208</words>
The woman’s smile deepened, and Elias felt the invisible allies—his old lies—dissolve into the soil. <words>221</words>
The computer chimed, its restart complete, as if the world itself had reset. <words>230</words>
She plucked the tag from his fingers, her touch warm. <words>236</words>
"Now we’re even," she said, and Elias knew he’d been outplayed. <words>244</words>
The orchard’s vines swayed, whispering secrets to the rusted beams. <words>251</words>
Elias grinned, truly this time, the weight of his truth no longer his alone. <words>260</words>
The woman turned, her silhouette merging with the dappled light. <words>267</words>
Elias watched her go, the blank tag now a promise. <words>273</words>
The computer’s glow pulsed, a silent witness to the first honest deal he’d ever made. <words>283</words>
The orchard hummed, alive with the ghosts of what could be. <words>290</words>
Elias pocketed the tag, his fingers lingering on the number he’d written. <words>299</words>
The woman’s laughter echoed, a sound that belonged to the ruins. <words>306</words>
Elias took a breath, the air sweet with apples and rust. <words>313</words>
The computer’s screen dimmed, its work done. <words>319</words>
Elias stepped forward, the orchard’s vines parting for him. <words>326</words>
The truth, at last, was his to keep. <words>330</words>
