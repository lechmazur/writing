The underwater welder adjusted his goggles, the vintage button box clutched in his calloused hands, its brass edges worn smooth by time. <words>18</words>
He stood at the crossing where two timelines should never meet, the air thick with the scent of salt and ozone. <words>25</words>
The broken planetarium, reimagined as a nightclub, pulsed with fractured light, its domed ceiling a mosaic of forgotten constellations. <words>34</words>
Patiently impatient, he traced the box’s engravings, each groove a whisper of improbable power. <words>41</words>
In the vintage store mirrors lining the walls, he caught glimpses of himself—not as he was, but as he might become. <words>51</words>
The reflections flickered, revealing a man who could mend more than metal, who could stitch time itself. <words>60</words>
His motivation burned like a welding torch: to wield that power, to unravel the knots of fate. <words>69</words>
The button box hummed in his grip, its contents shifting like tides, promising answers if he dared to open it. <words>79</words>
Around him, the club’s patrons danced in slow motion, their laughter echoing through the shattered cosmos above. <words>89</words>
He pampered the box, brushing dust from its hinges, knowing the moment of unraveling was near. <words>98</words>
The mirrors showed him glimpses of a world where the planetarium was whole, where time flowed in a single, unbroken thread. <words>111</words>
His breath hitched as the box’s latch clicked open, revealing not buttons, but fragments of stolen moments. <words>122</words>
Each one pulsed with inherited mystery, a legacy of those who had tried—and failed—to control time. <words>132</words>
The welder’s hands trembled; he was no longer just a man with a torch, but a guardian of the crossing. <words>143</words>
The club’s music swelled, the stars above realigning as he plucked a fragment from the box. <words>153</words>
In the mirrors, his reflection aged, then reversed, a dance of patient impatience. <words>161</words>
He pressed the fragment to his chest, feeling the weight of improbable power settle into his bones. <words>171</words>
The planetarium’s dome groaned, its cracks sealing as the timelines wove together, just for a heartbeat. <words>182</words>
The button box snapped shut, its purpose fulfilled, its secrets safe once more. <words>190</words>
The welder exhaled, the crossing stable—for now. <words>195</words>
He pocketed the box, the nightclub’s glow dimming as the stars above settled into their rightful places. <words>206</words>
The moment of unraveling had passed, but the echoes of what could be lingered in the air. <words>216</words>
He turned toward the exit, the weight of the box a reminder of the power he now carried. <words>226</words>
The mirrors caught one last glimpse of him—a man who had touched the threads of time and lived. <words>236</words>
Outside, the city hummed, unaware of the welder’s burden, of the crossing’s fragile balance. <words>246</words>
He walked into the night, the button box warm against his side, its mystery now his own. <words>256</words>
The planetarium’s lights flickered behind him, a silent sentinel guarding the timelines he had briefly mended. <words>267</words>
The welder smiled, knowing the next unraveling would come—and he would be ready. <words>276</words>
