The cyber-templar stood at the edge of the sky burial site, his armor humming with euphoric agitation as the storm raged above. <words>20</words>
Clutching the worn leather bridle, he whispered to the wind, his voice lost in the howl of the tempest. <words>30</words>
The mirage of safety had always been his creed, but now reality loomed like a prism, refracting his purpose into fractured light. <words>40</words>
Patiently frantic, he adjusted the bridle’s straps, each movement deliberate, each breath a countdown to revelation. <words>50</words>
The storm was not just weather—it was a test, a collision course with the truth he had spent lifetimes avoiding. <words>60</words>
Lightning split the sky, and he raised the bridle high, its leather creaking like an old promise. <words>70</words>
Through the refraction of light through a prism, he would prove his worth, bending the storm’s fury back upon itself. <words>80</words>
The wind screamed, and the cyber-templar’s circuits burned with the weight of his conviction. <words>90</words>
He had read the signs, the ancient texts, the warnings—all of them leading here, to this moment of reckoning. <words>100</words>
The bridle was not just an object; it was a tether, a last connection to the world he had sworn to protect. <words>110</words>
As the lightning struck, he angled the bridle just so, and the storm’s wrath refracted, a blinding arc of defiance. <words>120</words>
The sky burial site trembled, the dead whispering their approval from the cliffs below. <words>130</words>
His armor flickered, the mirage of safety shattering like glass, revealing the raw, unfiltered truth beneath. <words>140</words>
He was not just a warrior—he was a prism, bending reality to his will, proving that even storms could be answered. <words>150</words>
The lightning coiled around the bridle, and for a heartbeat, the world held its breath. <words>160</words>
Then, the storm roared back, but this time, it was different—it was his. <words>170</words>
The cyber-templar laughed, a sound lost in the thunder, as the sky itself bent to his command. <words>180</words>
The bridle glowed, the leather scorched but unbroken, a testament to his patiently frantic resolve. <words>190</words>
The mirage was gone, but in its place stood something greater: the unshakable certainty of his own power. <words>200</words>
The storm raged on, but now it was a dance, a duel, a reflection of his own defiance. <words>210</words>
He had come to prove himself, and in the refraction of light, he had found more than proof—he had found truth. <words>220</words>
The sky burial site was silent now, the dead at peace, their whispers carried away by the wind. <words>230</words>
The cyber-templar lowered the bridle, his armor cooling, his mind clear for the first time in centuries. <words>240</words>
The storm still raged, but he was no longer afraid—he was the storm, and the storm was him. <words>250</words>
