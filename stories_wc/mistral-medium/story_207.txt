The abandoned space station medical bay hummed with the universe’s secret song, its flickering lights casting long shadows over rusted equipment. <words>20</words>
A forthright peddler, meekly assertive, sifted through rumor-laden gossip columns, his fingers tracing the faded ink of forgotten scandals. <words>33</words>
Clutched in his other hand was a dried flower bouquet, its petals brittle but still vibrant, a relic of a promise he could no longer keep. <words>45</words>
His oath, sealed in blood, had bound him to silence, but the weight of it now felt like a chain dragging him into the void. <words>58</words>
He had once been a healer here, before the station was left to drift, before the patients vanished, before the lies took root. <words>71</words>
The gossip columns whispered of betrayals and broken vows, and as he read, he realized the truth had been divided, scattered like stardust. <words>85</words>
His redemption’s path lay in piecing it back together, in speaking the words he had swallowed for too long. <words>95</words>
The dried flowers trembled in his grip as he made his decision—he would break the oath, not with violence, but with truth. <words>108</words>
The station’s ghosts seemed to lean in, their breath cold against his neck, but he stood firm, joyful loneliness swelling in his chest. <words>122</words>
He began to speak, his voice steady, dividing the lies from the truth by sifting through the rumors like a surgeon’s scalpel. <words>135</words>
The medical bay’s monitors flickered to life, their screens reflecting his face—older now, but lighter, as if the weight had lifted. <words>149</words>
The dried flowers crumbled slightly, their fragrance long gone, but their purpose fulfilled. <words>158</words>
He had been a peddler of secrets, but now he was a peddler of truth, and the universe hummed its approval. <words>171</words>
The station’s walls seemed to sigh, the air less stale, as if the very metal remembered what it was to be alive. <words>184</words>
His hands, once steady with deception, now trembled with relief, the dried bouquet a testament to what he had carried. <words>198</words>
The gossip columns fluttered to the floor, their lies exposed, their power broken. <words>207</words>
He had divided the truth from the falsehoods, and in doing so, had divided himself from the past. <words>218</words>
The universe’s song grew louder, a chorus of forgiveness, and he smiled, knowing his path to redemption was finally clear. <words>231</words>
The medical bay, once a tomb of silence, now pulsed with the quiet joy of a man unburdened. <words>243</words>
He placed the dried flowers on the counter, their duty done, and stepped into the light, ready to face whatever came next. <words>257</words>
The station’s hum wrapped around him like an old friend, and for the first time in years, he felt free. <words>270</words>
The oath was broken, the truth spoken, and the peddler walked forward, his heart as light as the stardust around him. <words>284</words>
The universe’s song carried him onward, a melody of second chances and the quiet strength of a soul redeemed. <words>299</words>
