The apathetic summoner lounged in the shared dream recording studio, his fingers tracing the rustic coffee grinder’s worn handle as the last breath of a dying god lingered in the air. <words>20</words>
He was enthusiastically lazy, content to let the world crumble so long as his coffee stayed warm, but the river wisdom whispered through the walls, urging him to act. <words>35</words>
The studio’s deserted hall was lined with empty frames, each one a silent plea for meaning, and as he unfolded the first, a vision of dying coral reefs flickered into existence. <words>48</words>
The summoner sighed, stirring his coffee with a flick of his wrist, but the river’s voice grew sharper, its gentle sharpness cutting through his indifference. <words>62</words>
He knew the frames were more than decorations—they were portals, and if he matched them correctly, he could stitch the reefs back together. <words>75</words>
With a groan, he set down his grinder and stepped into the first frame, the studio dissolving around him as the river’s wisdom flooded his veins. <words>88</words>
The reefs were skeletal, bleached by neglect, but the summoner’s hands glowed as he wove the river’s magic through the water, coaxing life from the ruins. <words>103</words>
Each frame he unfolded revealed another fragment of the reef, and though his body ached with effort, the river’s voice kept him moving, its tone a blade wrapped in silk. <words>119</words>
By the time he matched the last frame, the coral pulsed with color, and the summoner collapsed onto the studio floor, his coffee long cold. <words>132</words>
The river’s wisdom hummed in his bones, but he was too tired to care, his apathy returning like an old friend. <words>143</words>
Yet as he reached for the grinder, he noticed a single frame still empty, its edges shimmering with possibility. <words>153</words>
The summoner hesitated, then unfolded it, revealing not a reef, but his own reflection—older, wiser, and holding a coffee cup that never emptied. <words>166</words>
The river’s voice chuckled, its gentle sharpness now laced with pride, and the summoner smirked, realizing he’d been played. <words>178</words>
He’d rebuilt the reefs, but the river had rebuilt him, and though he’d never admit it, he was grateful. <words>190</words>
With a sigh, he poured himself another cup, the grinder’s rustic grind a comforting rhythm as the studio’s walls pulsed with the river’s heartbeat. <words>203</words>
The frames were no longer empty, and neither was he. <words>208</words>
The summoner took a sip, the coffee bitter and perfect, and for the first time in centuries, he didn’t feel like summoning anything at all. <words>223</words>
The river’s wisdom curled around him like steam, and he let it, knowing the reefs would thrive, and so, in time, would he. <words>237</words>
The last breath of the dying god had become his first, and the studio hummed with the quiet promise of beginnings. <words>250</words>
He picked up the grinder, its rustic weight familiar in his hands, and smiled at the empty frame, now filled with the faintest glow of coral. <words>264</words>
The summoner was still lazy, but now, he was lazily hopeful. <words>269</words>
And that, the river whispered, was enough. <words>273</words>
