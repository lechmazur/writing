<story>
The hesitant swordsman stood at the edge of the frigid tundra orchard, his breath curling like smoke in the icy air, the geothermal vents hissing steam into the twilight. <words>20</words>
His fingers trembled as he clutched the blank postcard, its emptiness a silent accusation of all he had failed to say. <words>30</words>
The final piece of evidence had been filed away that morning, sealing the fate of the old ways, and now only the hermit crabs scuttling between shells offered any method of escape. <words>45</words>
He had always been naturally awkward, his words stumbling like the crabs themselves, but the weight of tradition pressed harder than the cold. <words>58</words>
The orchard stretched before him, its gnarled trees bearing fruit that glowed faintly in the dim light, a relic of a world slipping away. <words>70</words>
To restore the traditional systems, he knew he must bridge the gap between what was and what could be, but the path was as unclear as the postcard in his hand. <words>87</words>
Ephemeral rancor simmered in his chest, a bitter blend of grief and resolve, as he watched the crabs emerge from their shells, trading one life for another. <words>103</words>
If they could shed their pasts so easily, why couldn’t he? <words>109</words>
The tundra wind howled, carrying the scent of sulfur and frost, and he stepped forward, his blade unsheathed but unsteady. <words>123</words>
The geothermal vents pulsed like a heartbeat, their warmth a fleeting promise in the desolation. <words>132</words>
He knelt, pressing the postcard into the snow, its blankness now a canvas for the future. <words>141</words>
The crabs gathered around it, their tiny claws tracing patterns in the frost, as if writing what he could not. <words>154</words>
The swordsman exhaled, his hesitation melting like the ice beneath his boots. <words>162</words>
If the world could be bridged by the life of hermit crabs moving shells, then perhaps he, too, could emerge from his doubt. <words>177</words>
The first stroke of his blade carved a path through the orchard, not to destroy, but to reconnect. <words>188</words>
The trees shivered, their glowing fruit trembling as if in recognition. <words>195</words>
He moved with purpose now, each step a vow, each breath a defiance of the cold. <words>205</words>
The postcard, once blank, now bore the marks of the crabs’ journey, a map of tiny, determined steps. <words>218</words>
The final piece of evidence was filed away, but the story was not over. <words>226</words>
The tundra orchard would bloom again, its roots fed by the warmth of the vents and the resolve of a swordsman who had finally found his voice. <words>242</words>
The crabs scuttled onward, their shells clattering like whispers of the past. <words>251</words>
He sheathed his blade, the ephemeral rancor replaced by something lighter, something like hope. <words>262</words>
The world would be bridged, not by force, but by the quiet, persistent life of those who refused to be left behind. <words>275</words>
And so, with the postcard as his witness, he stepped into the future, the orchard at his back and the crabs at his feet. <words>288</words>
The final piece of evidence was filed away, but the story was just beginning. <words>297</words>
