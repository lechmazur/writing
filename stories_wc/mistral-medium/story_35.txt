In the universal translation center, where languages dissolved into meaning, Elias tended the garden in silence, his hands cradling the earth as if it whispered secrets. <words>25</words>
Amid bird calls that wove through the air like threads, he noticed an embroidered purse half-buried in the soil, its stitches shimmering with a pattern he couldn’t name. <words>38</words>
His fingers brushed it, and the world flickered—a memory surfacing, sharp and sudden: a woman laughing, her voice the color of dawn. <words>50</words>
Elias had come to the center to understand the language of emotions, but his own were a cipher, regularly random, slipping through his grasp like water. <words>68</words>
The purse belonged to her, he realized—Liora, a fellow gardener from a silent retreat years ago, where they’d shared the quiet like a sacred text. <words>85</words>
She had embroidered it during their time there, each stitch a wordless confession, a map of longing neither could voice. <words>99</words>
Now, holding it, Elias felt the weight of what they’d left unsaid, the improbable ache of a connection that defied translation. <words>115</words>
The center hummed around him, its machines parsing every tongue but the one that mattered—the one written in glances, in the tilt of a head. <words>130</words>
He pressed the purse to his chest, and another flicker came: Liora’s hands guiding his in the soil, her touch teaching him what roots knew. <words>147</words>
The memory was a seed, and he wondered if she, too, had been haunted by the silence they’d shared, if she’d ever tried to speak it aloud. <words>165</words>
Birds called again, their songs stitching the air, and Elias knew he had to find her, to ask if she remembered the way the earth had trembled between them. <words>184</words>
But the center was a labyrinth of voices, and he was just a quiet gardener, his heart a garden overgrown with questions. <words>199</words>
He slipped the purse into his pocket, its embroidery a promise, and stepped into the crowd, searching for the one face that might flicker back. <words>215</words>
The machines translated everything but the silence, and Elias walked, his steps a language of their own, leading him toward the improbable. <words>231</words>
Somewhere, Liora might be listening to the same bird calls, her fingers tracing the same embroidered lines, waiting for the world to flicker again. <words>250</words>
And if he found her, would they speak? Or would they kneel in the soil once more, letting the earth translate what words could not? <words>268</words>
The purse warmed in his pocket, a heartbeat against his own, as the center’s lights flickered like memories struggling to surface. <words>285</words>
Elias closed his eyes, and for the first time, the silence felt like an answer. <words>295</words>
