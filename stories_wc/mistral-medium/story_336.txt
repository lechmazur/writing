The clock’s hands, aligned with the sun paths, whispered of a time when hope was not a fleeting ghost but a tangible force. <words>42</words>
He had once imprisoned himself in this palace, believing its walls could shield him from the absolute dark that gnawed at his soul. <words>56</words>
The clock’s chime echoed, a reminder that even in stillness, time moved—a placid ferocity that mirrored his own resolve. <words>68</words>
The undertaker’s fingers trembled as he adjusted the clock’s dials, following the sun’s arc as if it could lead him to redemption. <words>81</words>

With a final glance at the sun’s path, he turned away, carrying the weight of the clock’s wisdom into the unknown. <words>263</words>
