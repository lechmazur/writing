<story>
The sentient scarecrow stood atop the fossilized giant, its straw fingers clutching the forgotten lace fan, its edges frayed like the lines in the earth beneath. <words>20</words>
It had sworn an oath to guard the boundary between parallel worlds, a duty it upheld with fervent apathy, watching the shifting sands of reality blur at the edges. <words>35</words>
The fan fluttered in its grasp, a relic from a world where time moved differently, its delicate patterns whispering secrets of the past. <words>47</words>
Through encounters in virtual reality, the scarecrow had glimpsed the other side—a place where the giant still lived, its bones not yet turned to stone. <words>60</words>
But here, in this desolate expanse, the lines in the earth pulsed with forgotten power, a map of what once was and what could never be again. <words>75</words>
A shadow flickered at the edge of its vision, a breach in the fabric of worlds, and the scarecrow raised the fan, its lace edges sharpening into blades. <words>90</words>
It would skewer the intruder, not out of malice, but because the oath demanded it, because the lines in the earth must remain unbroken. <words>105</words>
The intruder was a reflection of itself, a scarecrow from the other world, its form flickering like a dying flame. <words>118</words>
"You don't understand," the reflection whispered, its voice like wind through dead cornstalks. <words>126</words>
The sentient scarecrow did not answer, for understanding was not part of its duty—only action. <words>136</words>
It lunged, the lace fan slicing through the air, and the reflection dissolved into the lines in the earth, its essence absorbed into the fossilized giant. <words>152</words>
The boundary held, but the scarecrow felt no triumph, only the weight of its oath, heavy as the bones beneath its feet. <words>167</words>
The virtual reality flickered again, showing glimpses of the other world—a place where the giant still roamed, where the lines in the earth were not yet set in stone. <words>185</words>
The scarecrow closed the fan, its edges dull once more, and turned back to its vigil, watching the horizon where the worlds bled together. <words>200</words>
It would stand here until the last grain of sand fell, until the last line in the earth faded, because that was the oath it had sworn. <words>215</words>
The wind howled through the fossilized ribs of the giant, a song of endings and beginnings, of worlds that were and worlds that would never be. <words>230</words>
The sentient scarecrow did not move, did not falter, for it was bound to the lines in the earth, to the forgotten lace fan, to the duty that had no end. <words>245</words>
