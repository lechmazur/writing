The empty tape dispenser sat on the rusted desk, its plastic shell cracked from years of neglect, a silent witness to the small-time con artist’s latest scheme. <words>20</words>
In the dystopian farm’s dim glow, where the air hummed with the weight of unspoken failures, he traced its edges, feeling the lull of remorse creep in. <words>35</words>
He was unusually normal—a man who thrived in the margins, where lies were currency and trust was a relic. <words>45</words>
But tonight, the ghosts of his past victims flickered at the edges of his vision, their hollow eyes accusing him in the flickering light. <words>57</words>
One by one, he interrogated them, not for answers, but for comfort, their spectral whispers a twisted balm for his guilt. <words>68</words>
“Why do you haunt me?” he demanded, though he already knew—they were the jaws of defeat, and he was grinning right into them. <words>80</words>
The farm’s skeletal crops swayed in the artificial wind, a mockery of life in a world that had long since given up on growth. <words>93</words>
He clutched the empty dispenser like a talisman, its uselessness a mirror to his own hollow victories. <words>103</words>
The ghosts didn’t answer, but their presence was a mild fervor, a reminder that even in this broken world, some debts couldn’t be outrun. <words>118</words>
He laughed, sharp and brittle, taunting the silence, taunting himself. <words>125</words>
The tape dispenser rolled off the desk, clattering to the floor, and for a moment, the ghosts stilled, watching. <words>136</words>
He picked it up, turning it over in his hands, wondering if he’d ever been anything more than a shadow in someone else’s story. <words>149</words>
The lull of remorse settled deeper, a weight he couldn’t shake, no matter how many cons he pulled. <words>160</words>
Outside, the farm’s automated harvesters groaned, their mechanical arms reaching for nothing, just like him. <words>172</words>
He pressed the dispenser to his chest, as if it could fill the void, but it was just another empty thing in a world full of them. <words>187</words>
The ghosts began to fade, their forms dissolving into the stale air, leaving him with only the echo of their voices. <words>200</words>
He grinned, because what else was there to do? <words>205</words>
The tape dispenser clicked uselessly in his grip, a metronome for his unraveling. <words>213</words>
The farm’s lights flickered, casting long shadows that stretched like fingers, pulling him deeper into the lull. <words>224</words>
He whispered to the ghosts, “Next time, I’ll be better,” but even he didn’t believe it. <words>233</words>
The empty dispenser thudded onto the desk, and he walked out into the night, where the dystopian fields waited, hungry for another lie. <words>245</words>
