The antique brass key burned in Elias's palm as he crouched beneath the rusted skeleton of the abandoned carnival roller coaster, its twisted tracks clawing at the twilight sky. <words>25</words>
He had always known he was different—sometimes always slipping into the astral plane without warning—but this time, the revelation had come like a thunderclap: they were hunting him. <words>40</words>
His breath came in sharp bursts as he tracked the sun's fading shadows, calculating the seconds before the next shift in light would reveal his hiding spot. <words>55</words>
The key, warm and humming with latent energy, was his only clue to why they wanted him, why his unyielding compassion for the lost souls he encountered in the astral realm had marked him. <words>75</words>
A distant shout echoed through the carnival ruins, and Elias bolted, his survival instincts honed by years of fleeing unseen pursuers. <words>88</words>
The roller coaster's decaying supports groaned as he vaulted onto the tracks, his movements a practiced spontaneity born of desperation. <words>103</words>
He could feel them closing in, their presence a cold weight in his chest, but the key pulsed against his skin, urging him forward. <words>119</words>
At the apex of the track, he paused, the world tilting as the astral plane tugged at his edges—he could flee there, but not without consequences. <words>135</words>
The key's purpose was clear now: it was a tether, a way to anchor himself between worlds, to preserve the survival skills that had kept him alive this long. <words>154</words>
A shadow moved below, and Elias leapt, the wind howling in his ears as he descended into the unknown, the key clutched tight in his fist. <words>169</words>
He landed in a crouch, the impact jarring his bones, but the key's warmth spread through him, steadying his resolve. <words>183</words>
They would follow, but he was ready—his compassion wasn't weakness, it was his strength, and he would use it to outmaneuver them. <words>199</words>
The sun dipped below the horizon, and Elias vanished into the gathering dark, the key's glow the only trace of his passage. <words>214</words>
Somewhere beyond the carnival, a door waited, one that only the key could open, and Elias would find it, no matter the cost. <words>230</words>
The hunt was far from over, but for the first time, he wasn't just fleeing—he was fighting back. <words>242</words>
The key's hum grew louder, a promise of answers, of survival, of a future where he could finally stop running. <words>257</words>
Elias grinned, the thrill of the chase sharpening his focus, and sprinted into the night, the roller coaster's ghostly silhouette watching over him. <words>275</words>
The stars blinked awake above, and Elias knew—this was only the beginning. <words>284</words>
