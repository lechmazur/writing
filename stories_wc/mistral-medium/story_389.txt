The thin-lipped warlock adjusted his cuffs with a formally casual air, his fingers brushing the viking ship figurehead fragment tucked into his coat pocket. <words>20</words>
It was said to be one of the lost artifacts, a relic of forgotten power, and he intended to claim it before the final calendar page of the year was flipped. <words>38</words>
The abandoned mine yawned before him, its forgotten library hidden deep within, where the air hummed with the weight of discredited textbooks. <words>50</words>
He had come to gorge on the fruit of knowledge despite the warnings etched into the crumbling walls—warnings he dismissed as the ramblings of lesser minds. <words>65</words>
The warlock’s steps echoed through the cavernous halls, his boots kicking up dust as he moved with the precision of a man who knew exactly where to look. <words>80</words>
The figurehead fragment pulsed faintly in his grip, its carved wood whispering of storms and conquest, guiding him toward the heart of the library. <words>95</words>
There, beneath the flickering glow of a single lantern, he found the tome he sought—a leather-bound volume rumored to hold cures for the incurable. <words>110</words>
Its pages crackled with age as he flipped through them, his thin lips curling into a smile at the promise of optimization, of bending fate itself to his will. <words>125</words>
But the words twisted on the page, shifting like serpents, their meaning just beyond his grasp, and the warlock’s certainty wavered. <words>138</words>
The figurehead fragment grew warm against his skin, its whispers turning to shouts, urging him to press on, to decipher the text before the year’s end. <words>153</words>
He worked feverishly, his mind racing as the lantern’s light dimmed, the shadows stretching long and hungry across the shelves. <words>165</words>
Then, with a sudden clarity, the words resolved—the cure was not for the body, but for the soul, a truth he had never considered. <words>178</words>
The warlock hesitated, his thin lips pressing into a line, the weight of the figurehead fragment suddenly heavy in his pocket. <words>190</words>
The mine trembled, dust raining from the ceiling as the final calendar page of the year fluttered to the ground, torn by unseen hands. <words>205</words>
He had his answer, but the cost was clear—the knowledge would consume him, just as it had consumed those who came before. <words>218</words>
With a deep breath, he closed the book, his fingers lingering on the cover, the confusing certainty of the moment settling into resolve. <words>232</words>
The warlock turned away, the figurehead fragment left behind on the shelf, its whispers fading into the silence of the forgotten library. <words>245</words>
Outside, the first light of the new year touched the horizon, and for the first time, he felt no hunger for the fruit of knowledge. <words>260</words>
The mine sealed itself behind him, the lost artifacts returning to their slumber, their secrets safe from those who would gorge without thought. <words>275</words>
The warlock walked into the dawn, his steps lighter, his mind clear, the thin-lipped smile now one of quiet understanding. <words>288</words>
The year had turned, and with it, so had he. <words>294</words>
