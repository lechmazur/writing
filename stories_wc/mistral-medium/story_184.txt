<story>
The scrappy tavern-hand, Elias, wiped his hands on his apron, the broken collection of seashells in his pocket clinking like a sad wind chime. <words>20</words>
He’d found them in the fossilized footprints of a dried-up riverbed, each one whispering of a time when the sands flowed backward. <words>35</words>
The vacuum chamber garden hummed around him, its glass walls bending light into prismatic lies, a place where predictably unpredictable things thrived. <words>48</words>
Elias wasn’t supposed to be here—tavern-hands didn’t belong in gardens of the elite—but the inescapable calling of the shells had dragged him in. <words>62</words>
He randomized their order in his palm, feeling the jagged edges like a cipher, a map to somewhere beyond the known realms. <words>75</words>
The garden’s caretaker, a woman with eyes like polished stone, watched him with flippant solemnity. <words>84</words>
“You’re not supposed to touch those,” she said, but her voice held no real threat, just the weight of a world that had already decided his fate. <words>99</words>
Elias grinned, his fingers tracing the spirals of the shells, each one a fossilized scream from a time when the riverbed was alive. <words>114</words>
The sands of time didn’t just flow backward here—they danced, twisted, and the shells were his ticket to ride the current. <words>127</words>
He pocketed them again, the clink louder now, a promise of chaos, of catapulting his imagination where no tavern-hand had gone before. <words>142</words>
The caretaker sighed, as if she’d seen this play out a thousand times, each ending the same: Elias, the shells, the garden swallowing them whole. <words>159</words>
But he didn’t care—he was already stepping into the footprints, the vacuum chamber’s air thinning around him, the world outside dissolving into static. <words>175</words>
The shells pulsed in his pocket, warm now, alive, and Elias laughed because he knew—this was the moment he’d been waiting for. <words>190</words>
The garden’s walls flickered, the footprints beneath him glowing like embers, and the sands of time reversed with a gasp. <words>205</words>
He was falling, rising, the shells scattering into the void, each one a star in a sky that had never existed. <words>218</words>
The caretaker’s voice echoed, distant now, “You’ll be back,” but Elias was already gone, the inescapable calling pulling him into the unknown. <words>234</words>
The tavern would forget him, the garden would reset, and the shells would wait for the next fool brave enough to listen. <words>248</words>
But for now, Elias was free, the predictably unpredictable universe bending to his will, the broken shells his only compass. <words>262</words>
And as the sands of time flowed backward, he grinned, because the best stories always began with a tavern-hand and a pocket full of dreams. <words>280</words>
