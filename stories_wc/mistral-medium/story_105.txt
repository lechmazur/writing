In the hush of a half-lit corridor, the outcast scholar clutched a seashell with a strange symbol, its curves mirroring the soul he’d spent years dissecting. <words>20</words>
The witch’s flying carpet garage hummed with forgotten magic, its walls lined with diaries hidden behind a tile in a public restroom, each page whispering secrets. <words>35</words>
He was strangely trustworthy, a man who carried the weight of midnight’s fleeting nature, determined to prove it only lasted so long. <words>47</words>
A jolt ran through him as the symbol on the shell pulsed, its glow casting frantic shadows across the diaries, their ink bleeding into the air. <words>60</words>
The scholar’s breath hitched—this was the key, the proof that time’s grip was not eternal, that even the darkest hour would break. <words>75</words>
He traced the symbol, feeling the soul it mirrored—his own, fractured yet resilient, like the cracked tiles beneath his feet. <words>88</words>
The garage shuddered, the carpets lifting as if stirred by unseen winds, their threads weaving the past and present into a single, frantic peace. <words>104</words>
A voice, neither his nor the witch’s, slithered from the diaries: *"Midnight is a lie, but so is dawn."* <words>115</words>
The scholar’s fingers trembled as he pressed the shell to his chest, its warmth searing through him, a truth too bright to ignore. <words>128</words>
The symbol flared, and the corridor twisted, the walls dissolving into a kaleidoscope of half-remembered dreams and half-written confessions. <words>143</words>
He saw himself in the mirroring—an outcast, yes, but one who held the threads of time, who could unravel the witch’s lies with a single, deliberate jolt. <words>160</words>
The diaries fluttered open, their pages revealing the same symbol, over and over, a chorus of souls screaming the same truth: *Midnight ends.* <words>175</words>
The scholar laughed, a sound raw and wild, as the garage’s magic bent to his will, the carpets rising like waves beneath his feet. <words>189</words>
He stepped onto one, the symbol on the shell now glowing like a second heart, its light cutting through the frantic peace of the moment. <words>204</words>
The witch’s voice hissed from the shadows, *"You don’t belong here."* <words>210</words>
But the scholar only smiled, the shell’s truth burning brighter. *"Neither do you."* <words>216</words>
With a final jolt, the garage collapsed into itself, the diaries dissolving into dust, the carpets unraveling into threads of pure light. <words>231</words>
Midnight shattered, and the scholar stood alone in the dawn, the seashell now cold in his palm, its symbol faded but its truth etched into his bones. <words>248</words>
He had proven it—midnight only lasted so long, and so did the lies that bound him. <words>259</words>
The witch’s garage was gone, but the frantic peace remained, a quiet hum in the air, a promise that even outcasts could rewrite time. <words>275</words>
The scholar tucked the shell into his pocket, its weight a reminder: souls mirrored, truths unearthed, and the night always gave way. <words>290</words>
He walked into the light, the corridor’s hush now a memory, the diaries’ whispers a song he’d carry forever. <words>303</words>
And for the first time, he felt the strange trustworthiness of the world—broken, but beautiful, and finally, his. <words>316</words>
