The daring pathfinder, Elias, stood at the edge of the abandoned roller coaster track, its rusted rails twisting into the mist like a serpent’s spine. <words>20</words>
His fingers traced the antique doorknob in his pocket, its brass surface worn smooth by time, the last fragment of a puzzle he couldn’t yet solve. <words>35</words>
Ingeniously clueless, he had followed whispers of a riddle older than time, one that promised answers if he could only piece together the clues. <words>48</words>
The wind howled through the skeletal remains of the amusement park, and Elias’s breath came quick, his mind racing amid the page turns of his tattered journal. <words>63</words>
He had spent months investigating bizarre housekeeping logs in haunted inns, each entry more cryptic than the last, their ink bleeding secrets he couldn’t quite grasp. <words>81</words>
The logs spoke of a door that wasn’t a door, of a track that led nowhere, of a riddle that eroded the sanity of those who sought it. <words>98</words>
Elias’s boots crunched on broken glass as he stepped onto the roller coaster’s platform, the wood groaning beneath him like a dying beast. <words>114</words>
The air smelled of damp metal and something older, something that didn’t belong in this world. <words>124</words>
He pulled the doorknob from his pocket, its weight heavier than it should have been, and pressed it against the rusted gate at the track’s peak. <words>140</words>
For a heartbeat, nothing happened—then the gate shuddered, its hinges screaming as it swung open, revealing a darkness that pulsed like a living thing. <words>158</words>
Elias’s pulse roared in his ears, but he stepped forward, the quiet mania in his chest urging him on. <words>171</words>
The riddle wasn’t just words; it was a place, a moment, a choice. <words>179</words>
The logs had warned of this—the way the track would twist reality, the way the doorknob would fit where no door should be. <words>196</words>
He was eroding, his edges blurring, his thoughts slipping like sand through fingers. <words>206</words>
But he had to know. <words>209</words>
The darkness swallowed him whole, and for the first time, Elias understood the riddle wasn’t meant to be solved—it was meant to be lived. <words>228</words>
The doorknob glowed faintly in his grip, the last fragment of a story that had no end. <words>239</words>
The roller coaster track vanished behind him, and Elias laughed, because the answer had been in the logs all along: the riddle was the journey. <words>256</words>
The haunted inns, the bizarre entries, the way the world bent around him—it was all part of the erosion, the slow unraveling of what he thought he knew. <words>276</words>
And as the darkness folded around him, Elias realized he wasn’t just a pathfinder anymore—he was the path. <words>290</words>
The doorknob clicked softly in his hand, and the last fragment of the riddle whispered his name. <words>302</words>
He stepped forward, into the unknown, and the world turned the page. <words>310</words>
