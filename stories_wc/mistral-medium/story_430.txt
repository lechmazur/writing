The reaver stood at the edge of Kaleidoscope Park, his scarred hands clutching a child’s drawing on crumpled paper, the colors bleeding like old wounds. <words>20</words>
The image was charmingly grotesque—a lopsided sun with teeth, grinning down at stick-figure children who danced in spirals, their limbs tangled like the park’s twisted pathways. <words>35</words>
He had found it tucked into the margins of his stolen ledger, where someone had scrawled poems in jagged ink, nagging at him like a ghost’s whisper. <words>47</words>
The words mocked him, their affection sharp as thorns: *"You’ll never taste the stars in a single kiss, not with that mouth full of lies."* <words>59</words>
Before the first lie was told, he had been open, hungry for the sky, but now the weight of generational patterns pressed down, turning his heart to stone. <words>73</words>
The park’s kaleidoscope of fractured light mirrored his fractured soul, each shard a memory of what he’d lost—or what had been stolen. <words>85</words>
A child’s laughter echoed, and he flinched, the sound too bright, too pure, like the drawing’s sun mocking his darkness. <words>96</words>
He wanted to crush the paper, to erase the poems, but the ink had seeped into his skin, staining him with truths he couldn’t outrun. <words>110</words>
The reaver’s breath hitched as he traced the child’s scribbled stars, their edges rough but radiant, like the kiss he’d never dare to take. <words>125</words>
The poems in the margins were a map, a taunt, a promise—each line a step closer to the stars, if only he’d stop lying to himself. <words>139</words>
Kaleidoscope Park spun around him, its colors bleeding into the sky, and for a moment, he saw the pattern: the lies, the hunger, the grotesque beauty of it all. <words>155</words>
The child’s drawing was a mirror, the poems a key, and the stars—oh, the stars—were just out of reach, waiting for him to stop running. <words>170</words>
He crumpled the paper, then smoothed it out again, the creases like scars, like the generational weight he carried. <words>182</words>
The reaver’s lips twisted into something almost a smile, almost a surrender, as he whispered the last line of the poem: *"Kiss the sky before it kisses you back."* <words>198</words>
The park’s fractured light swallowed him whole, and for the first time, he didn’t fight it. <words>208</words>
The child’s drawing fluttered to the ground, the sun’s grin now his own, as he stepped into the kaleidoscope’s embrace. <words>220</words>
The stars tasted like ink and laughter, like the first truth he’d ever spoken, and it burned sweeter than any lie. <words>233</words>
The reaver closed his eyes, and the park spun him into the sky, where the stars kissed him back. <words>244</words>
The poems in the margins faded, their work done, as the child’s drawing dissolved into the wind, its colors bleeding into the dawn. <words>258</words>
And for the first time, the reaver was free. <words>263</words>
