<story>
The ethereal plains stretched endlessly, their golden hues whispering of a world reborn after the last resource war. <words>15</words>
Elias, an apocalyptic farmer, knelt in the cracked earth, his hands cradling seeds that promised life where none should thrive. <words>25</words>
His fingers trembled—not from exhaustion, but from the weight of a magician’s deck of trick cards tucked in his pocket, a relic of a time when illusions still mattered. <words>35</words>
The cards were his secret, their edges worn from nights spent shuffling under the glow of a dying sun, each one a fragment of the song of boundaries he could never quite sing. <words>47</words>
He jabbered to the wind, his voice raw with solace, as if the plains themselves might answer. <words>54</words>
The messages in bottles he’d sent across the sea had returned empty, their glass mouths silent, but he kept writing, because to stop was to surrender. <words>66</words>
The war had left him with nothing but the seeds and the cards, and a hunger to escape the life dictated by the victors. <words>76</words>
His crops were typically atypical—twisted vines that bore fruit like jewels, their sweetness laced with the bitterness of memory. <words>86</words>
One evening, as the sky bled into twilight, he drew a card: the Magician, reversed. <words>93</words>
The plains hummed, and for the first time, the song of boundaries felt within reach. <words>100</words>
He pressed the card to his chest, the paper thin as hope, and whispered, “Show me the way.” <words>109</words>
The wind answered, carrying a bottle to his feet, its contents not a message, but a single seed—black as the void between stars. <words>121</words>
Elias planted it without hesitation, his hands steady now, the trick cards forgotten. <words>128</words>
By dawn, the seed had split the earth, its roots weaving through the soil like veins, its stem stretching toward the heavens. <words>139</words>
The song of boundaries swelled around him, a chorus of the lost and the found, and he knew this was his escape. <words>149</words>
The plant bore no fruit, no flowers—only a single, shimmering leaf, its surface etched with words he couldn’t read but understood. <words>161</words>
He plucked it, and the moment it touched his lips, the plains dissolved into light. <words>168</words>
When he awoke, the war was a dream, the cards were dust, and the sea carried no more bottles. <words>178</words>
Only the seeds remained, their promise unbroken, their song now his to sing. <words>185</words>
Elias walked forward, his steps light, his heart unchained, the ethereal plains stretching before him like a blank page. <words>195</words>
The last resource war had ended, but his war—his quiet rebellion—had just begun. <words>203</words>
He would plant the seeds, not for survival, but for defiance, for the raw solace of a world remade. <words>213</words>
The magician’s deck was gone, but its magic lingered in the soil, in the wind, in the song of boundaries that now pulsed in his veins. <words>224</words>
And when the next bottle washed ashore, he would not open it. <words>230</words>
He would let the sea keep its secrets, and he would keep his. <words>237</words>
The plains whispered his name, and Elias, the apocalyptic farmer, finally answered. <words>245</words>
