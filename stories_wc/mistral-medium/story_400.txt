The glacial orchard hung suspended over a crevasse of blue ice, its branches heavy with fruit no human would ever taste. <words>18</words>
A guarded druid stood among the frostbitten trees, his breath curling in the air like a question he refused to ask. <words>28</words>
In his palm lay a dull safety pin, its tarnished metal a relic of a world that had forgotten him. <words>38</words>
He was fiercely ambivalent, torn between the silence of the ice and the memory of voices long gone. <words>48</words>
Tonight, he would break the silence, not with words, but with the clatter of a special family meal prepared only on birthdays. <words>60</words>
The last human had set foot on Earth centuries ago, leaving behind only echoes and the druid’s crippling fear of being the last. <words>74</words>
He gathered frost-kissed apples, their skins brittle as old parchment, and arranged them on a slab of ice. <words>85</words>
The meal was a ritual, a defiance, a way to pretend the world still turned for someone other than himself. <words>96</words>
The safety pin pricked his thumb as he skewered the fruit, a sharp reminder of the fragility of his solitude. <words>108</words>
The glacial wind howled, but he laughed—a dour amusement at the absurdity of celebrating alone. <words>119</words>
Yet, as he ate, the silence softened, as if the ice itself had leaned in to listen. <words>129</words>
For the first time, he did not feel the weight of the crevasse beneath him, only the quiet companionship of the orchard. <words>142</words>
The fear did not vanish, but it no longer ruled him. <words>148</words>
He left the safety pin embedded in the ice, a marker for no one and everyone. <words>158</words>
The meal was over, but the silence was no longer unbroken—it hummed with the memory of what had been gathered. <words>172</words>
The druid turned his back on the crevasse, his footsteps lighter than they had been in centuries. <words>182</words>
The orchard swayed, its branches creaking like a chorus of voices he could almost understand. <words>193</words>
He did not look back. <words>196</words>
The ice held his offering, the safety pin glinting dully in the fading light. <words>205</words>
The fear remained, but so did the meal, the pin, the laughter—proof that even in the end, something could be gathered. <words>220</words>
The druid walked on, the glacial orchard suspended behind him, its silence no longer absolute. <words>230</words>
The crevasse yawned, blue and endless, but he did not falter. <words>238</words>
The last human had left, but the druid had not. <words>244</words>
And in that, there was a kind of victory. <words>249</words>
