The forgotten noble stood in the flickering glow of the spontaneous combustion lab, his fingers tracing the edges of an artificial hummingbird drone. <words>20</words>
Its wings hummed with a hollow recklessness, a sound that echoed the emptiness of his title. <words>28</words>
Between text messages, he pieced together old ticket stubs, each one a fragment of a life he no longer recognized. <words>38</words>
The lab’s walls pulsed with heat, a reminder of the illusions he sought to cut through. <words>47</words>
The drone darted above him, its movements mysteriously obvious, as if it knew the weight of his past. <words>57</words>
He fortified his resolve by reassembling the stubs, each tear and crease a testament to candor in small moments. <words>68</words>
The noble’s hands trembled, not from fear, but from the clarity of his purpose. <words>76</words>
The lab’s equipment hissed, a symphony of danger and discovery. <words>83</words>
The drone hovered closer, its artificial eyes reflecting the flicker of flames. <words>91</words>
He whispered to it, his voice lost in the hum of machinery. <words>98</words>
The stubs formed a mosaic of truth, each piece a defiance against the lies that had erased him. <words>110</words>
The noble’s breath hitched as the drone’s wings cast shadows like old memories. <words>119</words>
He knew the lab’s fires could consume him, but he no longer cared. <words>128</words>
The drone’s hum grew louder, a siren call to the reckless honesty he craved. <words>138</words>
His fingers moved faster, the stubs aligning into a pattern only he could see. <words>148</words>
The lab’s heat seared his skin, but he welcomed the pain. <words>156</words>
The drone’s flight became erratic, mirroring the chaos of his thoughts. <words>165</words>
He laughed, a sound raw and unfiltered, as the last stub clicked into place. <words>175</words>
The mosaic revealed a name—his name—etched in ink and time. <words>183</words>
The drone spiraled upward, its hum now a triumphant cry. <words>190</words>
The noble’s eyes burned with the same fire that surrounded him. <words>198</words>
He reached for the drone, his fingers brushing against its wings. <words>206</words>
The lab’s flames roared, but he stood firm, his truth finally unshaken. <words>216</words>
The drone’s light flickered, a beacon in the consuming dark. <words>223</words>
He whispered his name aloud, the sound cutting through the illusions like a blade. <words>233</words>
The drone’s hum softened, a quiet acknowledgment of his victory. <words>241</words>
The noble closed his eyes, the heat and light and truth all merging into one. <words>250</words>
The lab’s fire swallowed the drone, but its hum lingered, a ghost of candor in the ashes. <words>260</words>
He smiled, the forgotten noble no longer forgotten, his truth etched in the flames. <words>270</words>
The last text message arrived, but he didn’t read it, his eyes fixed on the burning sky. <words>280</words>
The lab collapsed around him, but he stood still, his soul lighter than the drone’s wings. <words>290</words>
The fire consumed everything, leaving only the hum of truth in the hollow recklessness. <words>300</words>
