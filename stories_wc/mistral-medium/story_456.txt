The morbid florist stood in the floating rock dojo, her fingers brushing the petals of a blackened rose as the last flicker of a guttering lantern cast long shadows across the stone. <words>26</words>
She had always been neutrally passionate, neither drawn to joy nor despair, but the plain white candle before her now seemed to pulse with something beyond her tempered beliefs. <words>40</words>
The candle was unlit, yet its presence felt like a silent command, as if the universe itself had placed it there to oblige her to act. <words>55</words>
Her motivation had always been to understand cosmic cycles, to see the patterns in decay and rebirth, but the candle’s stillness unsettled her. <words>69</words>
She turned to the backlog of typed pages in a writer’s trunk, the words scrawled there promising answers—or at least, a path. <words>82</words>
The pages were brittle, the ink faded, but the boldly timid tone of the prose resonated with her, as if the writer had also stood at the edge of comprehension. <words>99</words>
She read of a dojo much like this one, where seekers came to unravel the threads of existence, only to find themselves woven deeper into the mystery. <words>116</words>
The candle flickered in her mind, though it remained unlit, and she wondered if the act of lighting it would break the cycle or complete it. <words>131</words>
Her hands trembled as she struck a match, the flame catching the wick with a hiss, and for a moment, the dojo seemed to hold its breath. <words>146</words>
The pages in the trunk rustled, as if stirred by an unseen wind, and the words rearranged themselves into a single, haunting line: *"The end is where we begin."* <words>164</words>
She exhaled, her morbid fascination giving way to something like peace, the candle’s glow now steady, its light revealing the dojo’s walls etched with symbols she had never noticed before. <words>184</words>
They were the same symbols from the pages, the same ones that had haunted her dreams, and she understood, at last, that the cosmic cycles were not to be feared but embraced. <words>203</words>
The candle burned brighter, the dojo’s floating rocks humming with energy, and she knew she had been right to oblige the silent call. <words>218</words>
The lantern’s last flicker died, but the candle’s flame endured, casting her shadow against the stone, a silhouette of acceptance. <words>232</words>
She closed the trunk, the pages now blank, their purpose fulfilled, and stepped toward the candle, her morbid curiosity tempered into something like reverence. <words>248</words>
The dojo’s walls pulsed, the symbols glowing, and she realized the cycle had not ended—it had simply turned, and she was part of it. <words>263</words>
She blew out the candle, the darkness complete, and for the first time, she smiled. <words>272</words>
The floating rocks drifted, the dojo dissolving into the void, and she with it, her understanding now as vast and quiet as the cosmos itself. <words>288</words>
The last flicker of the lantern had been a beginning, not an end, and she had finally seen the truth in the plain white candle’s unassuming glow. <words>304</words>
