<story>
In the suspended palace anchored to giant stalactites, a whimsical tinkerer named Elias adjusted his brass thermometer, its needle flickering like a nervous heartbeat. <words>20</words>
The palace, a marvel of floating stone and iron, swayed gently as Elias sculpted delicate gears into a pop-up carnival fortune-teller, its paper limbs whispering secrets. <words>35</words>
He was oddly truthful, a trait that made his creations unsettling—each fortune a stark reflection of the world’s decay, not the sugar-coated lies others preferred. <words>48</words>
As the artist’s brush first met canvas below, Elias watched the thermometer’s mercury rise, chronicling the creeping warmth that gnawed at the palace’s icy foundations. <words>62</words>
The fortune-teller’s latest prophecy unfolded: *"The ice will melt, and the palace will fall, but your hands will remember the cold."* <words>75</words>
Elias’s fingers trembled; he knew mortality wasn’t just a concept for the dying—it was etched into the groaning stalactites, the thinning air, the way his own breath fogged the brass. <words>92</words>
He sculpted faster, weaving environmental changes into the fortune-teller’s mechanisms, each click of its gears a plea for someone—anyone—to listen. <words>108</words>
The palace’s inhabitants, draped in silks and denial, called him a madman, but the thermometer’s climb was undeniable, its truth as sharp as the stalactites’ points. <words>125</words>
When the first chunk of ice shattered against the palace’s underbelly, Elias didn’t flinch; he’d seen it in the fortune-teller’s dance of shadows and light. <words>141</words>
As the canvas below captured the moment of creation, Elias’s final sculpture emerged—a miniature palace, melting in the fortune-teller’s palm. <words>156</words>
The crowd gasped, but Elias only smiled, his whimsy now a weapon of practical illusion, forcing them to see what they’d ignored. <words>170</words>
The stalactites groaned, the palace tilted, and the thermometer’s mercury burst free, a silver tear for a world too late to save. <words>183</words>
Elias’s hands, calloused from truth, cradled the fortune-teller as the palace fell, its gears still whispering, *"You were warned."* <words>197</words>
The impact was silent in the vast cavern, but the echo of his work lingered—a chronicle of change, sculpted in brass and regret. <words>211</words>
Above, the artist’s brush hovered, frozen mid-stroke, as if time itself had paused to mourn the tinkerer who’d dared to measure the unmeasurable. <words>227</words>
The fortune-teller’s last fortune fluttered to the ground: *"Even the sky forgets, but the earth remembers."* <words>238</words>
Elias’s body lay still, but his thermometer, now buried in the rubble, ticked upward, a final testament to the heat that had won. <words>251</words>
The suspended palace was gone, but its story remained, carved into the stalactites’ bones and the tinkerer’s unyielding truth. <words>264</words>
The artist’s canvas, untouched by the fall, bore a single stroke—a line of red, like a wound, or a beginning. <words>277</words>
And somewhere, in the dark, a new tinkerer picked up a gear, the cycle of warning and ruin spinning anew. <words>290</words>
