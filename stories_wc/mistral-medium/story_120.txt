The bell’s echo marked a forgotten recess, and once again, I found myself in the quantum tunnel, my fingers tracing the weathered fishing lure in my pocket—a relic from a life I couldn’t outrun. <words>30</words>
Time looped like a broken record, but this time, I swore I’d break it, nest my traumas in acceptance, baptize my nightmares in the sound of a single raindrop. <words>50</words>
The tunnel hummed with excited boredom, a paradox of endless repetition and the thrill of almost remembering why I was here. <words>65</words>
I was a paramedic, but my real job was stitching together the frayed edges of my own mind, each loop a chance to heal what I’d left unhealed. <words>80</words>
The lure was my anchor, its rusted hook a reminder of the day my father taught me to fish, the day before he vanished into the same tunnel I now haunted. <words>100</words>
At the bell’s echo, I’d wake again, the lure in my palm, the raindrop’s sound my cue to begin. <words>110</words>
This time, I pressed the lure to my chest, feeling its jagged edges like a key to a lock I couldn’t see. <words>120</words>
The quantum tunnel flickered, a privately public space where my past and present bled together, where every loop was a confession I couldn’t voice aloud. <words>140</words>
I needed to nest my grief, to fold it into the fabric of time until it no longer tore at me. <words>150</words>
The raindrop fell, and I listened, letting its sound dissolve the walls between loops, between who I was and who I could be. <words>165</words>
The tunnel pulsed, and for the first time, I saw my father’s face in the flicker, his smile the same as the day he handed me the lure. <words>180</words>
“You’re stuck,” he said, “but not forever.” <words>185</words>
I clutched the lure tighter, the bell’s echo fading into the hum of the tunnel, the raindrop’s sound now a chorus. <words>195</words>
This was the loop where I’d let go, where I’d baptize my nightmares in acceptance and step out of the tunnel, unhealed but no longer broken. <words>210</words>
The quantum tunnel shivered, and I knew—this was the last time. <words>215</words>
I dropped the lure, and the tunnel swallowed it whole, the sound of the raindrop now a roar, a flood of memories washing over me. <words>230</words>
The bell’s echo was gone, replaced by the steady beat of my own heart, the tunnel collapsing into a single point of light. <words>245</words>
I woke in the real world, the lure gone, my hands empty but my chest lighter, the nightmares finally baptized in the sound of a single raindrop. <words>265</words>
The quantum tunnel was behind me, but the lesson remained: some wounds don’t heal, they just learn to breathe. <words>280</words>
I walked away, the bell’s echo a distant memory, the lure’s absence a promise kept. <words>290</words>
For the first time, I wasn’t waiting for the loop—I was living beyond it. <words>300</words>
