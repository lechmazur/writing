The tense bodyguard stood at the edge of the lunar greenhouse, his fingers tracing the faded photograph of a woman he barely remembered. <words>20</words>
Her face, half-erased by time, was the only fragment of his past not controlled by the corporation that owned his contract. <words>32</words>
Amid park visits to the crater’s edge, he collected whispers—overheard stories of rebels who had slipped their chains. <words>42</words>
Each tale was a seed, serendipitously stubborn, taking root in his mind like the genetically modified vines curling around the greenhouse’s glass. <words>56</words>
His motivation hardened: to break free, to ratify his existence beyond the corporate ledger. <words>64</words>
The greenhouse hummed with life, a stark contrast to the sterile corridors of the lunar base, where his every move was monitored. <words>76</words>
One evening, as the Earth hung swollen in the sky, he found a story about a man who had faked his death and vanished into the asteroid belt. <words>90</words>
The idea took hold—a timely rebirth, not as a fugitive, but as someone new. <words>98</words>
His serene anger fueled him, a quiet fire beneath the surface, as he pieced together a plan from the fragments he’d gathered. <words>112</words>
The photograph would be his key; its faded edges held a code, a way to erase his digital footprint. <words>124</words>
He moved through the greenhouse, plucking leaves from the vines, each one a step closer to freedom. <words>134</words>
The corporation’s grip was tightening, their drones patrolling the crater’s edge more frequently. <words>143</words>
But he was ready. <words>145</words>
On the night of the next park visit, he slipped the photograph into the system’s core, watching as his file flickered and dissolved. <words>158</words>
The greenhouse lights dimmed, then brightened—his rebirth complete. <words>164</words>
No longer a bodyguard, no longer owned, he stepped into the crater’s shadow, the Earth’s glow his only witness. <words>176</words>
The vines behind him rustled, as if whispering approval. <words>181</words>
He had broken free, not with violence, but with the stubborn persistence of a story that refused to be silenced. <words>194</words>
The lunar wind carried the scent of green things growing, of life asserting itself against the void. <words>206</words>
He smiled, the photograph now a relic of a past that no longer defined him. <words>215</words>
Ahead lay the unknown, but for the first time, it was his to choose. <words>223</words>
The corporation would search, but they would find only echoes—a man who had slipped through their fingers like moonlight through leaves. <words>236</words>
His serene anger had burned away the chains, leaving only the quiet certainty of freedom. <words>246</words>
The greenhouse stood behind him, a testament to growth, to the fragments of stories that had made him whole. <words>258</words>
He walked on, the crater’s edge his first step into a life of his own making. <words>267</words>
The Earth watched, silent and approving, as he vanished into the lunar night. <words>274</words>
