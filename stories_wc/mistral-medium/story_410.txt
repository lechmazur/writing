In the cavern cathedral alive with phosphorescent flora, the astute hermit sat sharpening his blunt scissors, their strangely effective edges glinting in the eerie glow. <words>20</words>
The elevator arrived to an empty floor with a groan, its rusted doors parting to reveal nothing but the scent of a fresh loaf of bread wafting from the depths. <words>35</words>
The hermit sighed, his despairing humor surfacing—of course the bread would mock him now, when the water systems had failed and the last of his rations had turned to dust. <words>48</words>
He had spent years in isolation, convinced that solitude would amplify his focus, but the cavern’s silence had only deepened his loneliness. <words>61</words>
The scissors, his only tool, had become a symbol of his futile efforts—blunt yet somehow cutting through the vines that choked the ancient pipes. <words>75</words>
The bread’s scent was a cruel joke, a reminder of the world above, where people still ate and drank without thought. <words>86</words>
He stood, his joints creaking like the elevator’s gears, and followed the aroma to a hidden alcove where a loaf sat untouched, as if placed there by unseen hands. <words>102</words>
His motivation to restore the water systems flared—if he could fix the pipes, maybe the bread would return, maybe the isolation would end. <words>117</words>
With the scissors, he hacked at the vines, their sap glowing like the flora around him, each snip amplifying his resolve. <words>129</words>
The cavern seemed to breathe with him, the phosphorescent light pulsing as if urging him onward. <words>138</words>
He reached the heart of the system, where the last pipe lay buried under centuries of neglect, and with a final, desperate cut, the water gushed forth. <words>153</words>
The hermit laughed, a sound as rusted as the elevator, as the cavern cathedral roared to life, the flora drinking deeply. <words>165</words>
But the bread was gone, the scent vanished, and the elevator’s doors remained open, empty. <words>175</words>
He sat beside the flowing water, the blunt scissors in his lap, and wondered if the isolation had ever been the problem—or if the solution had been within him all along. <words>192</words>
The cavern’s glow dimmed, the water’s song fading into the silence he had once called home. <words>203</words>
The hermit picked up the scissors, their strangely effective edges now dulled by victory, and whispered to the empty floor, “Well, that’s one way to fix a leak.” <words>220</words>
The elevator groaned again, its arrival meaningless now that the water flowed, now that the bread’s scent had been a lie. <words>234</words>
He stood, his shadow stretching long across the phosphorescent walls, and walked toward the light, the scissors clutched like a relic of his old despair. <words>249</words>
The cavern cathedral hummed, alive but indifferent, as the hermit stepped into the elevator, its doors closing on the empty floor behind him. <words>264</words>
The water systems were restored, but the isolation remained, and the hermit smiled, because at least the scissors had been strangely effective. <words>278</words>
