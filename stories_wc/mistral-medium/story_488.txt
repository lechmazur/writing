The solitary summoner prowled the quantum beach at the hush just before the condemned building was demolished, his boots sinking into sand that shifted between grains and stardust. <words>20</words>
In his palm, a map drawn on a leaf trembled, its veins pulsing with the oddly authentic glow of forgotten constellations. <words>30</words>
He had spent years perfecting the spark of invention—a device that could bend time like a ribbon—but his reflection in the shattered windows always mocked him, sharper, brighter. <words>45</words>
Tonight, he would outshine it. <words>48</words>
The air smelled of salt and ozone, the beach humming with the quantum static of a thousand possible tides. <words>58</words>
His family’s holiday tradition—burning wishes into the sand—had always felt hollow, but now he understood: they were feeding the beach’s hunger. <words>72</words>
He knelt, pressing the leaf-map into the damp earth, and whispered the coordinates of the condemned building’s heart. <words>83</words>
The structure groaned, its bricks dissolving into fractals of light, and for a moment, he saw his reflection step out of the wreckage, grinning. <words>98</words>
“You’re late,” it said, voice like corroded rapture. <words>103</words>
The summoner clenched his fists, the spark of invention flaring in his chest. <words>110</words>
He lunged, but the reflection dissolved into the quantum foam, leaving only the leaf-map, now blank. <words>120</words>
The beach sighed, the sand swallowing the last of the building’s bones. <words>128</words>
He stood alone, the hush thickening around him, and realized the truth: he had never been competing with his reflection. <words>140</words>
It was him. <words>142</words>
The holiday’s fire flickered in the distance, his family’s laughter a distant echo. <words>150</words>
He pocketed the leaf, its edges crumbling into something new. <words>157</words>
The quantum beach whispered promises, but he turned away, the spark of invention now a quiet ember in his ribs. <words>170</words>
He would return to the condemned ruins, not to outshine, but to rebuild. <words>178</words>
The hush held, the world balanced on the edge of a breath. <words>185</words>
And for the first time, his reflection did not follow. <words>191</words>
The solitary summoner walked toward the firelight, the map’s glow fading into the corroded rapture of the night. <words>203</words>
His family’s tradition was not about feeding the beach, but about feeding the future. <words>213</words>
He reached into his coat, pulling out a fresh leaf, its surface smooth and waiting. <words>223</words>
The quantum beach hummed, the condemned building’s ghost still lingering in the air. <words>233</words>
He would draw a new map, one that led not to ruin, but to the spark of invention reborn. <words>245</words>
The hush before demolition was over. <words>249</words>
Now, the work began. <words>252</words>
The solitary summoner smiled, the corroded rapture of the night giving way to the oddly authentic glow of dawn. <words>265</words>
He would outshine nothing. <words>267</words>
He would create. <words>269</words>
