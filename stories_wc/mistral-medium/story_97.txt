The brass compass trembled in the oracle’s palm, its needle spinning wildly in the unstable dimension where time bent like a whispered minute. <words>20</words>
She was fact-minded, but here, facts dissolved into visions—each one a recomposed memory of places the world had forgotten. <words>32</words>
Desperately casual, she adjusted her grip, her heartbreak not from loss but from the weight of knowing too much without feeling enough. <words>44</words>
The compass wasn’t for direction; it was a key, its brass surface etched with paths only the broken-hearted could see. <words>56</words>
Her motivation wasn’t discovery—it was survival, for in this cradle of fractured time, empathy was the only anchor. <words>68</words>
The visions came unbidden: a child’s laughter in a ruined courtyard, a lover’s sigh in a hollowed-out cathedral. <words>78</words>
Each one stitched her soul tighter, the compass humming as it pulled her toward the next forgotten place. <words>88</words>
She moved with optimistic desperation, knowing the path to empathy wasn’t paved with logic but with the raw, unfiltered ache of connection. <words>102</words>
The dimension shifted, walls breathing like living things, and she pressed on, her boots leaving no prints on the shifting ground. <words>116</words>
A vision struck—a woman weeping over a shattered vase, the pieces recomposing into a flower that never bloomed. <words>128</words>
The oracle’s breath hitched; she understood now. The compass didn’t lead to places—it led to moments, to the cracks where empathy could take root. <words>142</words>
She followed the needle’s pull, her heartbreak no longer a wound but a lens, sharpening the blurred edges of the world. <words>156</words>
The unstable dimension flickered, and for a whispered minute, she stood in a field of golden wheat, the air thick with the scent of rain. <words>170</words>
A voice, soft as a sigh, asked, “Do you see?” She did. The forgotten places weren’t lost—they were waiting, patient as the compass in her hand. <words>186</words>
She closed her eyes, letting the visions recompose her, stitching her fractured self into something whole. <words>198</words>
When she opened them, the dimension steadied, the compass still, its needle pointing inward—toward her own heart. <words>210</words>
The path to empathy wasn’t a journey outward but a descent, a surrender to the weight of every whispered minute she’d carried. <words>224</words>
She smiled, the brass compass warm against her skin, its purpose fulfilled. The forgotten places were never about the where but the why. <words>238</words>
And in that unstable dimension, in the cradle of a whispered minute, she finally understood. <words>248</words>
The compass wasn’t a guide—it was a mirror, reflecting the empathy she’d been too fact-minded to see. <words>260</words>
