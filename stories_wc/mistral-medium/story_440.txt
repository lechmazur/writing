The detached swordsman stood in the futuristic city recycling center, his fingers brushing a piece of sea pottery pulled from a bin of collage scraps. <words>20</words>
The last swipe of paint had just completed a mural on the wall, its colors swirling like the secrets he carried. <words>30</words>
He was lovingly detached, a man who meddled only when the threads of fate demanded it. <words>40</words>
The secret weavers had whispered of an impossible vow, one that required more than steel—it needed fragments of forgotten art. <words>55</words>
With deliberate care, he reassembled the scraps, each piece humming with the echoes of the street artist’s vision. <words>65</words>
The recycling center’s humming machinery blurred into a rhythm, a backdrop to his quiet consecration. <words>75</words>
The pottery shard glowed faintly in his palm, a relic of a world drowned by time, now repurposed for something greater. <words>85</words>
He had no name, no past—only the vow, the blade, and the scraps that would bind them. <words>95</words>
The mural watched him, its playful seriousness a mirror to his own resolve. <words>105</words>
A gust of wind sent a scrap skittering across the floor, and he caught it before it vanished into the grates. <words>115</words>
The secret weavers had chosen him for this, not for his skill, but for his ability to see the sacred in the discarded. <words>125</words>
The pottery shard fit perfectly into the collage, a final piece that sealed the vow in silent ceremony. <words>135</words>
He stepped back, the mural now complete, its colors shifting as if alive. <words>145</words>
The recycling center’s lights flickered, and for a moment, the city beyond seemed to hold its breath. <words>155</words>
The swordsman sheathed his blade, the weight of the impossible vow settling into his bones. <words>165</words>
He had meddled, not for glory, but because the weavers had asked, and the scraps had answered. <words>175</words>
The street artist’s bin was empty now, its purpose fulfilled, its scraps reborn. <words>185</words>
The sea pottery shard pulsed once, a heartbeat of light, before fading into the collage’s embrace. <words>195</words>
The swordsman turned away, his work done, his detachment now laced with something like reverence. <words>205</words>
The city’s neon glow painted his silhouette as he walked, the mural’s playful seriousness lingering in his wake. <words>215</words>
The secret weavers would call again, and he would answer, because the impossible was just another thread to weave. <words>225</words>
The recycling center’s doors hissed shut behind him, sealing the moment like a promise. <words>235</words>
He carried no proof of the vow, only the knowing, the way the scraps had fit, the way the pottery had hummed. <words>245</words>
The futuristic city stretched before him, a canvas of endless possibilities, and he smiled, lovingly detached, ready to meddle once more. <words>255</words>
