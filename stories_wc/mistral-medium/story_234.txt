The gentle swordsman stood in the dinosaur skeleton museum at night, his fingers tracing the empty matchbox in his pocket, its absence of sparks a quiet metaphor for his own late-blooming life. <words>25</words>
He had always been faithfully unfaithful—loyal to the idea of love but never to a single heart, his affections scattered like the coded angles in the half-painted sundial that guided his steps. <words>45</words>
The orchard dog had finally stopped barking, its silence a signal, and he moved through the cavernous halls, the bones of ancient beasts looming like forgotten gods. <words>60</words>
His motivation was simple: to cradle the universe in a cupped hand, to hold its weight and wonder without breaking, though he knew he was too soft for such a task. <words>80</words>
A xenophile at heart, he sought beauty in the unfamiliar, in the way the moonlight fractured through the ribs of a T-Rex, in the way the air smelled of dust and time. <words>100</words>
The sundial’s shadow pointed him toward a display case, its glass reflecting his own weary eyes, and he wondered if he’d ever bloom or if he’d remain forever a bud. <words>120</words>
He pulled the matchbox from his pocket, turning it over in his palm, its emptiness a reminder of all the fires he’d failed to light. <words>135</words>
A voice echoed through the halls—another late-night wanderer, perhaps, or just the ghosts of the past—but he didn’t turn, his focus on the angles, the codes, the silent language of shadows. <words>155</words>
The brusque affection in his chest tightened; he loved the world too much to ever truly belong to it, a paradox that ached like an old wound. <words>170</words>
He pressed his palm against the sundial’s face, feeling the grooves of its half-painted surface, and for a moment, he imagined the universe small enough to hold. <words>185</words>
The museum’s silence wrapped around him like a shroud, but he wasn’t afraid—he was a late bloomer, after all, and time was the one thing he had in abundance. <words>200</words>
The empty matchbox clicked shut in his hand, a promise of something yet to come, a spark not yet struck. <words>210</words>
He stepped forward, his boots whispering against the marble, the sundial’s shadow stretching long and thin behind him like a path he’d never quite follow. <words>225</words>
The universe was vast, but his hands were steady, and in that moment, he believed—if only for a breath—that he might yet learn to hold it. <words>240</words>
The orchard dog barked once more in the distance, a final punctuation, and he smiled, the night still young, the world still wide. <words>255</words>
He left the matchbox on the sundial’s edge, an offering to the late bloomers who would come after him, their own hands trembling with the same impossible faith. <words>275</words>
The gentle swordsman walked on, his heart a quiet rebellion, his love a scattered constellation, his life a half-painted masterpiece. <words>290</words>
And somewhere, in the dark, the universe hummed, waiting to be cradled. <words>300</words>
