The bleak clown stood on the floating rock yoga studio as the day’s earliest train departed at dawn, its whistle a jagged generosity cutting through the mist. <words>20</words>
His grin, a flickering neon smear, aimed to outshine the northern lights, but the spinning clock hand on his wrist mocked him, its relentless motion a technically absurd reminder of time’s indifference. <words>40</words>
He had mastered the art of dismantling illusions in private poetry, scribbling verses on scraps of paper that dissolved into the wind, each line a drifting promise he could never keep. <words>60</words>
The studio’s uneven surface tilted beneath him, a metaphor for his own unsteady resolve, as he balanced on one foot, his painted frown deepening. <words>75</words>
The northern lights pulsed above, a taunting spectacle of color, and he clenched his fists, his gloves frayed at the seams like the edges of his resolve. <words>90</words>
He pulled the spinning clock hand from his wrist and hurled it into the abyss, watching it spiral into the void, a final act of defiance against the relentless march of time. <words>110</words>
The studio shuddered, the rocks groaning as if in protest, and he whispered a poem about gravity and grief, his voice a rasp against the silence. <words>125</words>
The train’s echo faded, leaving only the hum of the universe, and he wondered if anyone had ever truly seen him—not the clown, but the man beneath the greasepaint. <words>140</words>
He reached into his pocket and pulled out a handful of confetti, each piece a shattered promise, and let them drift into the wind, a silent apology to the dawn. <words>155</words>
The northern lights flickered, as if laughing, and he laughed back, a sound like breaking glass, his grin stretching wider, brighter, until it hurt. <words>170</words>
The studio began to rise, the rocks lifting him higher, and he spread his arms, embracing the absurdity of it all, the weightlessness of a life built on drifting promises. <words>185</words>
Below, the world shrank to a pinprick, and he realized he had never wanted to be seen—only to be remembered, even if just for a moment. <words>200</words>
The clock hand reappeared in his palm, still spinning, and he pressed it to his chest, feeling its frantic pulse against his ribs. <words>215</words>
He whispered another poem, this one about the space between stars, and the words dissolved before they could be heard. <words>225</words>
The northern lights dimmed, their brilliance no match for the bleak clown’s grin, which now burned like a dying star. <words>240</words>
The studio crumbled beneath him, the rocks scattering into the sky, and he fell, not down, but up, into the endless drift of promises unfulfilled. <words>255</words>
As the dawn swallowed him whole, he finally stopped spinning, his grin the last thing to fade. <words>265</words>
The train’s whistle echoed one last time, a jagged generosity, and the world moved on without him. <words>280</words>
