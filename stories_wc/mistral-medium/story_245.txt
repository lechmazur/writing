The irate smuggler pounded across the abandoned spaceport flight deck, his boots echoing like gunfire against the cracked metal, each step a rebellion against the silence. <words>20</words>
His breath came in ragged bursts, syncopated with the rhythm of his jogging, a ritual born of necessity and spite. <words>30</words>
Clutched in his fist was a single chopstick, its surface worn smooth by years of restless tapping against his thigh. <words>40</words>
It was the last remnant of a life he’d outrun, a talisman of the heart’s revolt against the sterile order of the stars. <words>50</words>
He skidded to a halt beside a rusted console, its screen flickering with the ghostly patterns of tea leaves swirling in a cup he’d left behind. <words>60</words>
The leaves had settled into a jagged line—a map, he was sure, to the hidden waterfalls rumored to cascade through the derelict corridors of the station. <words>70</words>
His fingers traced the abstractly physical contours of the pattern, the tea’s residue clinging to his skin like a promise. <words>80</words>
He’d spent years chasing whispers of water in the void, and now the leaves had spoken. <words>90</words>
With a snarl, he drove the chopstick into the console’s seam, prying open a panel to reveal a tunnel slick with condensation. <words>100</words>
The air smelled of ozone and damp stone, a scent so alien in the arid expanse of space that his chest tightened. <words>110</words>
He crawled forward, the chopstick clutched like a dagger, its tip scraping against the walls in a rhythm that mirrored his pulse. <words>120</words>
The tunnel opened into a cavern where water roared, a silver curtain crashing against the bones of the station. <words>130</words>
He stood at the edge, the spray stinging his face, and for the first time in years, he laughed—a sound raw and unbroken. <words>140</words>
Kneeling, he dipped the chopstick into the water, letting the current carve patterns into the wood, memorializing the moment in its grain. <words>150</words>
The heart’s revolt had led him here, to a place where the universe still bled beauty, where the abstractly physical could be held, if only for a breath. <words>160</words>
He pocketed the chopstick, its surface now etched with the waterfall’s song, and turned back toward the flight deck. <words>170</words>
The jogging would resume, the silence would return, but now he carried the weight of the water’s defiance in his bones. <words>180</words>
The tea leaves had been right—this was no mirage, no smuggler’s folly. <words>190</words>
It was proof that even in the void, the heart could carve its own path, leaving patterns in the wreckage. <words>200</words>
He ran faster now, the chopstick a brand against his palm, the waterfall’s echo a drumbeat in his veins. <words>210</words>
The flight deck stretched before him, a graveyard of forgotten journeys, but he no longer saw the rust. <words>220</words>
He saw the cracks where life seeped through, where the heart’s revolt could take root. <words>230</words>
And when he reached the end, he would leave the chopstick behind, a monument to the waterfalls no one else had found. <words>240</words>
The next smuggler would see it, and maybe they’d understand. <words>250</words>
Or maybe they’d just keep running. <words>255</words>
