The lurking assassin moved through the baroque asteroid’s labyrinthine corridors, his breath shallow beneath the weight of borrowed starlight. <words>18</words>
His paint-splattered camera lens captured the fractured reflections of the station’s dying glow, each smear a memory of missions past. <words>30</words>
The unforgiving road of his existence stretched before him, a path paved with the echoes of those who had dared to cradle the dawn in trembling hands. <words>44</words>
He paused at a junction where the walls shimmered like a spider’s web after rain, the pattern guiding him toward his target. <words>56</words>
The bus driver’s final route had just ended, and the station hummed with the quiet of abandonment, the perfect moment to strike. <words>69</words>
His victim, a poet who traded in superficially profound verses, stood beneath a flickering hologram of a sunrise, laughing at the irony of his own mortality. <words>85</words>
The assassin’s fingers twitched, but something in the man’s laughter—a fragile, defiant joy—made him hesitate. <words>97</words>
The poet turned, his eyes meeting the assassin’s, and for a heartbeat, the weight of the road they both walked pressed between them. <words>111</words>
“You think killing me will change anything?” the poet asked, his voice threading through the silence like a blade. <words>123</words>

The assassin turned away, the unforgiving road now a question rather than a sentence. <words>178</words>
As he walked, the paint-splattered lens caught the last glimmer of the station’s light, a final, fractured truth. <words>192</words>
The bus driver’s final route had ended, but his own journey had just begun. <words>202</words>
The baroque asteroid spun on, indifferent to the lives it held, its corridors whispering secrets to those who dared to listen. <words>217</words>
The assassin’s laughter, when it came, was quiet, a sound as fragile as the web after rain. <words>229</words>
He had come to kill, but left with something far more dangerous—a sliver of hope. <words>239</words>
The poet’s words lingered, a superficially profound truth that cut deeper than any blade. <words>250</words>
The road ahead was still unforgiving, but now, it was his to walk. <words>259</words>
