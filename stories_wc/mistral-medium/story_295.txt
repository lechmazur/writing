The jovial sellsword, boldly reluctant to admit his fear, trudged through the witch's herb garden, where the air hummed with the scent of sage and the distant whisper of the withering vow. <words>25</words>
His family tradition of making a time capsule weighed on him, a ritual meant to dethrone doubt from the mind, but tonight, the stars seemed to mock his hesitation. <words>40</words>
Clutched in his hand was an astronomical telescope, its brass gleaming under the moonlight, a treasure he’d stolen from a sorcerer’s vault. <words>55</words>
The garden twisted around him, vines curling like serpents, as the transformation of the land mirrored the chaos in his heart. <words>68</words>
He paused, adjusting the telescope, and glimpsed a comet streaking across the sky—a sign, perhaps, or just elegant mayhem. <words>80</words>
The witch’s voice slithered through the leaves, “You seek answers, but the withering vow demands sacrifice.” <words>90</words>
He laughed, though his grip on the telescope tightened, “I seek treasure, not wisdom.” <words>98</words>
The ground trembled as roots burst from the earth, forming a path to a gnarled oak, its hollow trunk pulsing with ancient magic. <words>113</words>
Inside lay a time capsule, its contents unknown, but the sellsword’s blood sang with the promise of gold. <words>124</words>
He reached in, fingers brushing a scroll that bore his family’s crest, the ink bleeding like fresh wounds. <words>135</words>
The words scrawled upon it were a riddle: “To break the vow, you must first embrace it.” <words>144</words>
A gust of wind howled, and the telescope’s lens shattered, scattering starlight like broken promises. <words>154</words>
The witch’s laughter echoed as the garden’s transformation reached its peak, the herbs writhing into monstrous shapes. <words>166</words>
He clenched the scroll, realizing the treasure was never gold—it was the courage to face the withering vow. <words>178</words>
With a roar, he tore the scroll in half, and the garden stilled, the air sweetening as doubt crumbled like dead leaves. <words>191</words>
The witch’s voice softened, “Now, you are free.” <words>195</words>
He pocketed the telescope’s remains, grinning at the sky, where the comet had vanished, leaving only the quiet hum of the stars. <words>210</words>
The time capsule’s purpose was fulfilled, its magic spent, but the sellsword’s heart was lighter, the family tradition no longer a chain. <words>226</words>
As dawn crept over the garden, he strode toward the horizon, the withering vow a distant memory, his laughter ringing through the transformed land. <words>242</words>
The treasure he carried now was not in his pouch, but in the boldness of his step, the clarity of his mind. <words>255</words>
The witch’s garden faded behind him, its herbs returning to their gentle sway, the elegant mayhem settled into peace. <words>269</words>
And so, the sellsword walked on, the telescope’s ghostly gleam guiding him toward whatever chaos—and triumph—awaited next. <words>282</words>
