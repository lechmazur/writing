The sneering envoy stood in the domed vineyard, its glass walls reflecting the barren alien plain beyond, where the sky bled starlight like a wound. <words>20</words>
His fingers trembled as he unfolded the note, its edges frayed from being sifted through the swirling leaves of the neglected greenhouse. <words>30</words>
The paper bore a single phrase: *"To cup starlight in mortal palms."* <words>36</words>
He exhaled, furiously tranquil, as if the weight of rambling destiny had settled into his bones. <words>44</words>
The vineyard’s vines coiled like serpents, their tendrils whispering secrets across the hush of a possibility just born. <words>54</words>
The envoy’s sneer deepened—he knew the cost of such ambitions, the paper trails that led to ruin. <words>62</words>
Yet the note’s command was clear, and he would obey, for the stars had chosen him. <words>70</words>
He knelt, pressing his palms into the alien soil, where the starlight pulsed like a heartbeat. <words>79</words>
The greenhouse’s glass fractured above him, leaves spiraling in the sudden wind, as if the universe itself sifted through his resolve. <words>90</words>
The envoy laughed, a sound both bitter and triumphant, as the first star fell into his cupped hands. <words>100</words>
Its light seared his skin, but he held on, the note’s ink burning brighter in his grip. <words>110</words>
The vineyard’s dome shattered, the barren plain now a canvas of falling stars, each one a promise, a curse. <words>120</words>
He stood, his palms glowing, the sneer gone—replaced by something like awe. <words>128</words>
The paper trail had led him here, to this moment, where the weight of the cosmos rested in his hands. <words>138</words>
The leaves swirled faster, the greenhouse’s ruins crumbling into the wind, as if the world itself unraveled. <words>148</words>
The envoy whispered the note’s words again, and the stars answered, their light weaving through his fingers. <words>158</words>
He knew the cost now—this was no gift, but a burden, a rambling destiny he could not refuse. <words>168</words>
The barren plain stretched endlessly, but he walked forward, the starlight guiding him, the note’s command his only truth. <words>179</words>
The vineyard’s vines withered behind him, their purpose fulfilled, their secrets spent. <words>187</words>
The envoy’s steps left no mark on the alien soil, as if he had never been, yet the stars burned brighter. <words>197</words>
He reached the edge of the plain, where the sky split open, revealing a path of pure light. <words>206</words>
The note crumbled to dust in his hand, its words now etched into his soul. <words>214</words>
The stars pulsed, and he stepped forward, his mortal palms cradling their fire, his sneer lost to the wind. <words>224</words>
The greenhouse was gone, the vineyard a memory, but the paper trail remained, leading ever onward. <words>234</words>
The envoy walked into the light, his silhouette swallowed by the starlight, his destiny no longer his own. <words>244</words>
The barren plain sighed, the wind carrying the last of the swirling leaves into the void. <words>252</words>
And somewhere, in the hush of a possibility just born, another note unfolded, another envoy sneered, another path began. <words>265</words>
