The lost apprentice wandered the interstellar orchard ship, its branches heavy with alien fruit, their scent thick with the promise of changing winds. <words>20</words>
He carried a fallen bird’s nest, its delicate weave a mocking affection for his own tangled thoughts. <words>30</words>
The ship hummed, a living thing migrating between galaxies, its corridors whispering traveler’s wisdom he couldn’t yet grasp. <words>40</words>
Privately open, he pressed the nest to his chest, as if its emptiness could reverse-engineer the freedom he craved. <words>50</words>
A static-laden confession crackled from an old cordless phone left in the ship’s hollow—his mentor’s voice, fractured but familiar. <words>60</words>
“You seek self-acceptance in the wrong places,” it hissed, the words twisting like the orchard’s roots. <words>70</words>
The apprentice clenched the nest tighter, its brittle edges biting into his palm, a mirror to his own fragility. <words>80</words>
The ship lurched, stars blurring past the viewport, and he stumbled, the phone’s static swallowing his breath. <words>90</words>
“Listen,” the voice urged, “the winds change for those who stop running.” <words>100</words>
He traced the nest’s curves, its abandoned purpose a lesson—freedom wasn’t in the flight but in the falling. <words>110</words>
The orchard’s fruit pulsed, their glow painting his face in shifting hues, mocking his hesitation. <words>120</words>
With a shudder, he dropped the nest, watching it spiral into the ship’s gravity, a surrender. <words>130</words>
The phone’s static softened, the mentor’s voice now a whisper: “You were never lost, only learning.” <words>140</words>
The apprentice laughed, the sound raw, as the ship’s winds carried the nest away, its journey complete. <words>150</words>
He turned toward the viewport, the galaxies stretching before him, their vastness no longer a threat but an invitation. <words>160</words>
The orchard’s branches swayed, their fruit ripe with unspoken truths, and he plucked one, its juice sweet on his tongue. <words>170</words>
The phone’s final crackle dissolved into silence, its wisdom absorbed, its purpose fulfilled. <words>180</words>
He stepped forward, the ship’s heartbeat steady beneath his feet, his own rhythm finally in sync. <words>190</words>
The winds shifted, and with them, his resolve—no longer an apprentice, but a traveler, privately open to the unknown. <words>200</words>
The nest was gone, but its lesson remained, woven into the fabric of the ship, the stars, himself. <words>210</words>
He closed his eyes, the static’s echo a lullaby, the orchard’s embrace his new home. <words>220</words>
Freedom, he realized, wasn’t in the destination but in the unraveling, the falling, the becoming. <words>230</words>
The ship hummed its approval, the galaxies watching as he finally, truly, began. <words>240</words>
The last of the static faded, leaving only the wind, the fruit, and the endless, mocking, affectionate sky. <words>250</words>
He smiled, the nest’s memory a feather in his palm, light as the promise of changing winds. <words>260</words>
