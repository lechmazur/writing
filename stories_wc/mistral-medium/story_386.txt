In the hush of a line that never moves, Elias stood at the atom-powered lighthouse, its hum a quiet defiance against the forgotten empire he had fled. <words>20</words>
The embroidered tablecloth, frayed at the edges, lay across his workbench, its patterns whispering of a time when stars aligned with purpose. <words>32</words>
He was a time refugee, trustworthy in his strangeness, his hands steady as he traced the constellations stitched into the fabric. <words>42</words>
The lighthouse’s beam cut through the borrowed dawn, a beacon for those who, like him, sought to bind old wounds with unstoppable will. <words>55</words>
Elias had spent years calculating the alignment of the stars, knowing the moment would come when the catapult hidden beneath the lighthouse would fling him back—not to his empire, but to a future where its scars could heal. <words>75</words>
The tablecloth was his map, its threads a language only he could read, guiding him through the fractures of time. <words>87</words>
He adjusted the catapult’s mechanisms, the gears groaning like the ghosts of his past, their echoes swallowed by the lighthouse’s eternal hum. <words>102</words>
The stars blinked into alignment, and Elias draped the tablecloth over his shoulders, its weight both burden and blessing. <words>115</words>
With a breath, he stepped onto the catapult’s platform, the atom-powered engine thrumming beneath him, ready to hurl him into the unknown. <words>128</words>
The lighthouse’s light pulsed, a heartbeat of borrowed dawn, as the mechanism released, sending him soaring through the hush of time. <words>142</words>
The wind tore at the tablecloth, but Elias held fast, his will unbroken, his defiance quiet but unyielding. <words>155</words>
He did not know where he would land, only that the wounds of his empire would not follow, and that was enough. <words>168</words>
The stars blurred into streaks of light, and for the first time in centuries, Elias smiled, trusting the strange path ahead. <words>182</words>
The lighthouse faded behind him, its beam a final whisper of hope, a promise that even in the hush of a line that never moves, some things could still change. <words>200</words>
Elias landed in a field of wildflowers, the tablecloth unfurling around him like a banner of forgotten triumph. <words>213</words>
He stood, brushing dirt from his sleeves, the stars above him unfamiliar but kind, their alignment a new beginning. <words>226</words>
The wounds of his empire were still there, but now they were scars, not chains, and he would wear them with quiet defiance. <words>242</words>
The atom-powered lighthouse was gone, but its light lived in him, a borrowed dawn he would carry forward. <words>255</words>
Elias folded the tablecloth carefully, its embroidery a testament to the will that had brought him here, to a future he would shape with his own hands. <words>272</words>
The hush of time no longer bound him, and with a deep breath, he stepped into the unknown, trustworthy in his strangeness, unstoppable in his resolve. <words>290</words>
