On a floating tea platform suspended above the misty valleys of the forgotten, Elias, a soul-broker real estate agent, adjusted his cufflinks with grandiose modesty. <words>20</words>
His latest client, a specter of a woman, demanded a property where the walls hummed with forgotten songs, and Elias knew just the place. <words>32</words>
He pulled a dusty wine bottle from his briefcase, its label reversed, and began to read the script backward, choreographing the deal with practiced ease. <words>44</words>
The bottle’s static surface shimmered weirdly, as if resisting the secrets it held, but Elias’s persuasion was an art honed through centuries of recycling souls. <words>58</words>
The specter leaned in, her hollow eyes reflecting the tea platform’s flickering lanterns, and whispered, “Will it remember me?” <words>69</words>
Elias smiled, swirling the bottle’s contents—a swirl of memories distilled into liquid—before pouring a drop onto the contract. <words>81</words>
“Every note,” he promised, his voice a velvet murmur, as the ink bled into the parchment, sealing her name into the property’s foundation. <words>95</words>
The platform swayed gently, the mist curling around them like a living thing, as the specter’s form solidified, her edges less frayed. <words>108</words>
Elias pocketed the bottle, its purpose fulfilled, and turned to the next client—a man who sought a home where time moved backward. <words>122</words>
“Ah,” Elias sighed, producing another bottle, this one crusted with the dust of a thousand recycled moments. <words>134</words>
He read the reversed label aloud, his words weaving through the air like a dance, choreographing the man’s desires into tangible reality. <words>148</words>
The man’s breath hitched as the platform’s tea leaves swirled in response, forming patterns of a life he’d lost. <words>161</words>
Elias’s static presence was a comfort, a fixed point in the ever-shifting market of souls, where every transaction was a forgotten song reclaimed. <words>177</words>
By the time the last client departed, the platform was littered with empty bottles, their labels now blank, their secrets spent. <words>191</words>
Elias gathered them, his fingers brushing the dusty glass with reverence, knowing each had once held a melody of longing. <words>205</words>
As the mist swallowed the platform whole, he whispered to the wind, “Until the next recycling,” and vanished into the static hum of the unseen. <words>220</words>
The bottles, now empty, clinked softly in his briefcase, their reversed labels waiting to be read again, their songs never truly forgotten. <words>235</words>
Elias’s work was never done, for the art of persuasion was eternal, and the market of souls always hungry for another verse. <words>250</words>
He stepped onto the next platform, where a new specter waited, her hands clutching a dusty wine bottle of her own. <words>264</words>
“Ah,” Elias murmured, “let’s begin.” <words>267</words>
The bottle’s static surface shimmered, and the dance of persuasion started anew. <words>275</words>
