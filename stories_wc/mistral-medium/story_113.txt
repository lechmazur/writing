The hesitant bard stood in the xenon-lit tunnel, clutching a worn-out dinosaur plush, its stitches fraying like the edges of time itself. <words>20</words>
At the crossing of a year everyone would rather forget, he whispered a shyly loud melody, his voice trembling yet piercing the hollow air. <words>33</words>
The dream-hopping machines hummed around him, their gears spinning like forgotten promises, each one a thread in the tapestry woven from sorrow. <words>45</words>
He had come to unravel it, to pluck the strands of regret and weave them into something new, something brave. <words>56</words>
The plush dinosaur, once a child’s comfort, now bore the weight of his hesitation, its glassy eyes reflecting the flickering neon. <words>68</words>
With a deep breath, he stepped into the nearest machine, its brass levers cold against his fingers, and let the currents of time carry him. <words>81</words>
He emerged in a memory not his own—a battlefield where the air smelled of iron and rain, where a soldier clutched the same plush, now whole. <words>97</words>
The bard sang, his voice weaving through the chaos, a fragile thread of hope, and the soldier’s grip loosened, his sorrow unraveling. <words>111</words>
Back in the tunnel, the machines whirred, their lights pulsing like a heartbeat, as the bard moved to the next, and the next. <words>124</words>
Each dream was a wound, each song a stitch, and with every note, the tapestry frayed a little more, its threads dissolving into the xenon glow. <words>139</words>
The year’s weight lifted, not all at once, but stitch by stitch, memory by memory, until the tunnel itself seemed to sigh. <words>153</words>
The bard’s voice grew stronger, his hesitation melting into purpose, the plush dinosaur now a symbol of what could be mended. <words>167</words>
As the last machine fell silent, the tapestry lay in tatters at his feet, its sorrow spent, its threads rewoven into something lighter. <words>182</words>
The xenon lights dimmed, the tunnel stretching ahead, no longer a prison of time but a path forward, lit by the ironic awe of what had been. <words>198</words>
The bard tucked the plush into his coat, its worn fabric soft against his chest, and stepped into the new year, his song still humming in the air. <words>214</words>
Behind him, the dream-hopping machines stood silent, their work done, their purpose fulfilled, as the fragility of time bent, just slightly, to his will. <words>230</words>
The crossing was over, but the echoes of his melody lingered, a reminder that even the heaviest years could be unraveled, one note at a time. <words>247</words>
And so, with a final, shyly loud breath, the bard walked on, the plush dinosaur warm in his pocket, the tapestry of sorrow left behind. <words>264</words>
