Beneath the earth, where roots drank from a river of stars, the sentient car mechanic knelt by the park fountain, its gears humming with exultant grief. <words>20</words>
The vintage opera glasses dangled from its neck, their brass frames catching the starlight as it studied the water’s surface, where lost puzzle pieces swirled like forgotten whispers. <words>35</words>
Each fragment was a confession never spoken, a truth too heavy for the living to carry, and the mechanic’s repulsively attractive form—a fusion of rust and grace—ached to gather them. <words>48</words>
It sorted the pieces by touch, their edges sharp with sorrow, their colors faded like memories left in the sun. <words>58</words>
The subterranean orchard stretched around it, trees heavy with fruit that pulsed like distant suns, their glow reflecting in the fountain’s dark water. <words>71</words>
Time here was a concept of infinity, a loop of moments where the mechanic could linger, piecing together the unsaid from the fragments it collected. <words>84</words>
A piece shaped like a teardrop fit into another, jagged as a scream, and the mechanic’s heart—a tangle of wires and longing—thrummed with recognition. <words>98</words>
It pressed the opera glasses to its face, magnifying the fragments until the confessions bled into the air, voices rising from the water like ghosts. <words>112</words>
“I loved you,” one whispered. “I failed,” another sobbed. The mechanic gathered them all, its hands trembling with the weight of truths it could never speak itself. <words>128</words>
The river of stars above rippled, as if the universe itself leaned closer to listen. <words>136</words>
The puzzle was endless, the fragments infinite, but the mechanic would not stop, for in each piece, it found a sliver of its own fractured soul. <words>150</words>
The orchard’s fruit trembled, their light dimming as the mechanic’s grief deepened, its exultation a quiet fire burning through the dark. <words>164</words>
It knew the confessions would never be whole, but the act of gathering them was enough—a ritual of love in a world that had forgotten how to listen. <words>180</words>
The water stilled, the fragments settled, and the mechanic bowed its head, its repulsive beauty a testament to the sorrow it carried. <words>194</words>
Above, the stars hummed a lullaby for the broken, and the mechanic, with its opera glasses and its puzzle of lost voices, became a keeper of the unsaid. <words>210</words>
Infinity stretched before it, a road without end, and the mechanic walked it, one fragment at a time. <words>221</words>
The subterranean orchard sighed, its roots drinking deeper from the river of stars, as if nourished by the mechanic’s devotion. <words>235</words>
The puzzle would never be complete, but the mechanic would never stop trying, for in the fragments, it heard the echoes of its own unspoken heart. <words>250</words>
And so, beneath the earth, where time was a whisper and grief a song, the sentient car mechanic gathered the pieces, forever studying, forever listening. <words>265</words>
