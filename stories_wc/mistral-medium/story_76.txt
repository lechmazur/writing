The ship’s library, half-sunk and forgotten, held censored books, their pages warped by time and saltwater. <words>48</words>

The film club’s members paused their movie, drawn to the light spilling from the ruins. <words>208</words>
Elias didn’t notice; he was too busy tracing the words that had warped the world back to life. <words>218</words>
