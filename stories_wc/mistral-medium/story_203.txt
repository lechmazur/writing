The exorcist’s hands trembled as he pressed wildflowers into the old book, their petals brittle as orbital debris drifting beyond the station’s cracked window. <words>20</words>
He had inherited the lies of his father, a man who whispered incantations by the sound of a key turning in a lock, never usual, always defiant. <words>35</words>
Now, amid toy assembly—tiny wooden soldiers scattered across the table—the exorcist carved sigils into their chests, sculpting possibility from the ashes of “never.” <words>50</words>
The station groaned, its metal bones shifting as if to submerge him in the weight of his failure, his stage fright a living thing. <words>65</words>
He had been trained to banish demons, but the real terror was the silence, the hush that followed when the last prayer died unspoken. <words>80</words>
The wildflowers were his mother’s, pressed between pages of forgotten hymns, their scent long faded like the faith he could no longer summon. <words>98</words>
A shadow flickered in the corner—his father’s ghost, or perhaps just the flicker of dying lights, the orbital debris catching the sun’s glare. <words>115</words>
The exorcist clenched his fists, the toy soldiers trembling under his touch, their painted eyes accusing. <words>125</words>
He had to finish the ritual, to turn the key in the lock of his own voice, to defy the silence that had swallowed his father whole. <words>142</words>
The station shuddered again, and he knew the demons were close, drawn by the scent of fear, by the inheritance of lies. <words>157</words>
With a breath, he submerged himself in the incantation, his voice raw but unbroken, the wildflowers crumbling to dust between his fingers. <words>172</words>
The toy soldiers stood at attention, their wooden hearts beating in time with his pulse, the orbital debris outside spinning into a halo of light. <words>188</words>
The key turned, not in a lock, but in the air itself, and the station fell silent, the demons retreating into the void. <words>203</words>
He had done it—sculpted possibility from the ashes, defied the hush, broken the cycle of lies. <words>215</words>
But as the dust settled, he saw his father’s face in the reflection of the window, smiling, proud, and for the first time, the exorcist understood. <words>230</words>
The inheritance was not the lies, but the defiance, the never usual, the pressing of wildflowers into the cracks of the world. <words>245</words>
He picked up a toy soldier, its paint chipped but unbroken, and placed it in his pocket, a talisman against the silence. <words>260</words>
The orbital debris glittered like a promise, and he knew he would return, again and again, to sculpt, to submerge, to defy. <words>275</words>
The station hummed, alive with the sound of a key turning, and the exorcist, at last, was not afraid. <words>290</words>
He pressed the last wildflower into the book, its petals holding the weight of the stars. <words>300</words>
The demons would come again, but so would he, and the inheritance of lies was now a legacy of light. <words>315</words>
The toy soldiers marched in his mind, their wooden hearts unyielding, and the exorcist smiled into the defiant hush. <words>330</words>
