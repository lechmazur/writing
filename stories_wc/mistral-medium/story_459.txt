Liam adjusted his tool belt, the weight of his ghost-seeing burden heavier than any wrench. <words>12</words>
The sand castle preservation lab hummed with the dissonance of silence, its walls lined with fragile sculptures frozen in time. <words>22</words>
Amid lunch breaks, he staked out local ghost tours, dissecting their stories for clues about the spirits that lingered in his vision. <words>32</words>
His fingers brushed a dried flower crown on his workbench, a relic from a ghost who had once loved him. <words>42</words>
Elegantly clumsy, he knocked over a vial of adhesive, the spill mirroring the chaos of his heart. <words>52</words>
The lab’s sterile air couldn’t erase the whispers of the dead, their voices tangled in the grains of sand. <words>62</words>
He longed for liberation in letting go, but the ghosts clung like the stubborn glue he used to mend the castles. <words>72</words>
One noon, a specter in a tattered dress appeared, her crown of dried flowers matching the one on his bench. <words>82</words>
“You see me,” she murmured, her voice a thread in the silence. <words>88</words>
Liam’s hands trembled as he reached for her, his tools useless against the weight of memory. <words>98</words>
The lab’s clock ticked, a metronome for his fractured focus. <words>104</words>
She pointed to the crown, her gesture a question he couldn’t answer. <words>111</words>
With a sigh, he lifted it, the petals crumbling like the sand castles he preserved. <words>121</words>
The ghost smiled, her form dissolving into the sterile light. <words>128</words>
Liam’s breath steadied; the dissonance of silence now held a note of peace. <words>136</words>
He swept the petals into his palm, their dust a promise of release. <words>144</words>
The lab’s hum softened, the ghosts’ whispers fading into the rhythm of his own heartbeat. <words>154</words>
For the first time, the weight of his sight felt lighter, the castles’ fragility a mirror of his own. <words>164</words>
He pocketed the last petal, a talisman of the elegantly clumsy dance between holding on and letting go. <words>175</words>
The afternoon sun slanted through the windows, gilding the sand and the ghosts’ absence. <words>183</words>
Liam returned to his work, the silence now a companion, not a cage. <words>191</words>
The dried flower crown was gone, but its essence lingered in the air, a whisper of liberation. <words>201</words>
He picked up his tools, the ghosts’ stories no longer chains but threads in the tapestry of his life. <words>211</words>
The lab’s door creaked open, a breeze carrying the scent of salt and time. <words>220</words>
Liam stepped into the light, his shadow stretching long and unburdened. <words>228</words>
The sand castles stood firm, their preservation a testament to the beauty of impermanence. <words>237</words>
He smiled, the dissonance of silence now a symphony of acceptance. <words>244</words>
The ghosts were still there, but so was he—whole, at last. <words>250</words>
