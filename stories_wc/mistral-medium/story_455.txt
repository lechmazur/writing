The disgruntled wishing-well attendant sat cross-legged beside the crumbling stone, his fingers tracing the edges of a collection of foreign coins, each one a whisper from a life he’d never lived. <words>25</words>
His scars, thick and silvered, pulsed beneath his sleeves, their weight a reminder of the silent judgments of old ghosts that lingered in the hollows of his bones. <words>38</words>
The well was a secret agent escape route, its depths a labyrinth of forgotten paths, and he was its keeper, intensely relaxed as if the world’s chaos couldn’t touch him. <words>50</words>
At the crossing of two unwritten paths, where moonlight bled into shadow, he waited, his breath slow, his pulse steady. <words>62</words>
A figure emerged from the dark, their steps hesitant, their face obscured by the shifting patterns of the trees. <words>73</words>
The attendant didn’t move, but his gaze followed the shadow patterns, corroborating what he already knew—they were lost, just like him. <words>87</words>
“You’re not here to wish,” he murmured, tossing a coin into the well, its clatter echoing like a secret. <words>98</words>
The stranger hesitated, their fingers brushing the well’s edge, their own scars hidden but no less heavy. <words>110</words>
“No,” they admitted, their voice rough with the weight of things unsaid. <words>117</words>
The attendant smiled, a flicker of understanding passing between them like a shared ghost. <words>127</words>
“Then let’s out-face them together,” he said, gesturing to the well’s dark mouth, where the past and future tangled like roots. <words>142</words>
The stranger nodded, and as they stepped into the shadows, the coins in the attendant’s pocket grew warm, their foreign edges humming with inherited mystery. <words>160</words>
The well swallowed them whole, its depths a mirror of their scars, their fears, their unspoken paths. <words>173</words>
And for the first time in years, the attendant felt the weight lift, just a little, as if the ghosts had finally turned their gaze elsewhere. <words>190</words>
The crossing was complete, the paths unwritten no more, and the well’s secrets remained, as they always had, just beyond reach. <words>207</words>
But the coins in his pocket were lighter now, their stories no longer his to carry alone. <words>218</words>
And as the moonlight faded, the attendant closed his eyes, intensely relaxed, knowing that some burdens were meant to be shared. <words>232</words>
The well hummed its approval, the shadows danced, and the ghosts, at last, were silent. <words>243</words>
The crossing had been made, the weight of scars acknowledged, and the unwritten paths now bore the footprints of two. <words>257</words>
The attendant exhaled, the foreign coins cool against his skin, their mystery no longer his to solve. <words>269</words>
And in that moment, he was free. <words>273</words>
