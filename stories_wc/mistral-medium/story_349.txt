The drone pilot, lost in a medieval fantasy realm, stood at the edge of the abandoned observatory on a cliff, the dried herb bundle clutched in his hand like a lifeline. <words>25</words>
The hush before the orchard’s trees were cut down hung thick in the air, a silence that felt like the world holding its breath. <words>38</words>
He was cynically hopeful, a man who had seen too much to believe in miracles but still whispered prayers to the wind. <words>50</words>
The observatory’s broken lenses reflected the dying light, and he wondered if anyone else could see the horizons of mercy stretching beyond the ruin. <words>65</words>
At a speed dating event in the village below, he had met a woman who spoke of disseminating seeds before the harvest’s end, her words luring possibility from the brink of despair. <words>85</words>
She had pressed the herb bundle into his palm, her fingers warm against his skin, and told him to scatter it where the wind was strongest. <words>100</words>
Now, standing on the cliff, he crushed the herbs between his fingers, letting the charred serenity of the moment settle into his bones. <words>115</words>
The scent rose like a promise, and for the first time since crashing into this world, he felt something akin to purpose. <words>128</words>
Below, the orchard waited, its fate sealed by the axes that would come at dawn, but the herbs would carry its memory into the sky. <words>145</words>
He whispered her name, though he couldn’t remember it, and let the wind take the fragments of his voice along with the herbs. <words>160</words>
The drone’s wreckage lay buried in the earth, but his hands were steady as he released the last of the bundle into the gale. <words>175</words>
The observatory creaked behind him, its stones whispering of forgotten stars, and he wondered if mercy was just another word for letting go. <words>192</words>
The woman’s laughter from the speed dating event echoed in his mind, and he smiled, though his heart ached with the weight of what he couldn’t save. <words>210</words>
The herbs swirled upward, a fleeting constellation, and he knew this was the only way to honor the orchard’s end. <words>225</words>
As the last light bled from the sky, he turned away from the cliff, the wind still humming with the ghosts of possibility. <words>240</words>
The drone pilot, no longer lost but not yet found, walked toward the village, where the axes would soon begin their work. <words>255</words>
He carried nothing but the scent of herbs and the quiet certainty that mercy was not in the saving, but in the scattering. <words>270</words>
The orchard’s trees would fall, but their essence would ride the wind, and that was enough. <words>280</words>
The abandoned observatory stood sentinel behind him, its silence now a benediction. <words>290</words>
He stepped into the gathering dark, the dried herb bundle’s memory still warm in his palm. <words>300</words>
