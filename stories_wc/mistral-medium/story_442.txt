The edgy tradesman adjusted his synchronized watch as the final rotation of the forgotten windmill groaned outside the giant mushroom house, its gills pulsing with dim bioluminescence. <words>20</words>
He clutched the torn corner of a flyer, its edges frayed like the edges of his own memories, the ink smudged into something unreadable yet familiar. <words>35</words>
"Time’s a thief," he muttered, his voice a comfortingly pessimistic rasp, as he traced the distorted lines of the flyer with calloused fingers. <words>47</words>
The flickering candle in his other hand cast long, wavering shadows across the mushroom’s spongy walls, the flame a fragile defiance against the endless void pressing in. <words>63</words>
He needed to vectorize the flyer’s remnants, to lock its fading details into something permanent before the windmill’s last creak silenced the world. <words>78</words>
The air smelled of damp earth and something older, something that clung to the back of his throat like regret. <words>89</words>
His watch beeped in sync with the windmill’s rhythm, a mechanical heartbeat counting down to an end he couldn’t name. <words>102</words>
The flyer’s torn corner held a promise—or a warning—he couldn’t quite recall, but the urgency gnawed at him like the void’s hunger. <words>118</words>
He pressed the paper against the mushroom’s wall, where the bioluminescence pulsed in response, as if the house itself remembered. <words>131</words>
The candle’s light flickered, and for a moment, the shadows stretched into shapes he almost recognized—faces, places, a life half-forgotten. <words>147</words>
The windmill’s final rotation shuddered through the ground, and the tradesman’s breath hitched, his pessimism a shield against the weight of what was slipping away. <words>164</words>
He vectorized the flyer’s image into his watch, the device humming as it etched the distortion into something sharper, something that might outlast the void. <words>182</words>
The candle’s flame steadied, as if acknowledging the act, and the mushroom’s glow brightened just enough to reveal a path forward. <words>198</words>
The tradesman exhaled, the comfort of his own cynicism wrapping around him like a worn coat. <words>210</words>
He stepped into the void, the candle’s light carving a fragile line through the blurry vividness of the endless dark. <words>223</words>
The windmill’s last groan echoed behind him, a sound that might have been a name, a memory, or just the wind. <words>236</words>
He didn’t look back. <words>238</words>
The void swallowed the sound, but the candle burned on, and the watch ticked, and the flyer’s distortion lived, for now, in the flicker between forgetting and knowing. <words>258</words>
The tradesman walked, because that was all there was left to do. <words>265</words>
The endless void stretched ahead, but the candle’s light held, and the watch kept time, and the memory—distorted, fragile—endured. <words>282</words>
Somewhere, the windmill stood still. <words>286</words>
Somewhere, the mushroom house pulsed. <words>290</words>
And the tradesman carried the candle, because the void was endless, but so, in its own way, was he. <words>303</words>
