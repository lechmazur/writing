<story>
The poison taster with a death wish stood beneath the subterranean waterfall, its roar a strangely compelling lullaby as he traced the energy flows with his fingertips. <words>20</words>
His simple cloth bookmark, frayed at the edges, fluttered in the damp air, a silent witness to the frantic calls he’d once interpreted for talk-radio psychics. <words>35</words>
The ice sculpture loomed above him, its delicate curves trembling in the final second before collapse, a metaphor for the hidden societies he’d sworn to unravel. <words>48</words>
He had bound himself to this moment, not by choice but by the weight of secrets—each sip of poison a step closer to the truth, each near-death a map of unseen currents. <words>63</words>
The waterfall’s mist clung to his skin like a second soul, whispering of the serene upheaval that awaited those who dared to listen. <words>75</words>
His motivation was never suicide, but the opposite: to live so fully that death became irrelevant, a mere threshold to cross while charting the invisible. <words>90</words>
The radio static in his mind had once been a cacophony of desperate voices, but now it was a symphony, guiding him deeper into the cavern’s heart. <words>105</words>
The ice cracked, a sound like breaking glass, and he closed his eyes, feeling the energy shift, the hidden societies pulsing beneath the earth. <words>119</words>
His bookmark slipped from his fingers, carried away by the water, a sacrifice to the forces he sought to understand. <words>132</words>
In the final second, he smiled—not in fear, but in recognition, as the sculpture collapsed and the water swallowed him whole. <words>145</words>
The poison taster had always known this was how it would end: bound to the truth, dissolved into the flow, his death wish fulfilled not by poison, but by the weight of knowing. <words>163</words>
The hidden societies would remember him, if only as a whisper in the dark, a man who had mapped the unseen and paid with his life. <words>178</words>
The waterfall’s roar faded into silence, the ice melted into nothing, and the cloth bookmark settled into the silt, its frayed edges still holding the echoes of frantic calls. <words>196</words>
Somewhere, a radio psychic paused mid-sentence, sensing the shift, the serene upheaval of a soul unbound. <words>208</words>
The poison taster’s body was never found, but his map of energy flows remained, etched into the cavern walls, a testament to the strangely compelling dance between life and death. <words>226</words>
The hidden societies would guard it, interpreting its lines like the frantic calls of old, binding themselves to its secrets. <words>240</words>
And in the final second before the next ice sculpture collapsed, another seeker would stand beneath the waterfall, bookmark in hand, ready to begin again. <words>258</words>
The cycle was eternal, the death wish a lie, the truth a current that never stopped flowing. <words>270</words>
