Amid the laconic exuberance of the lounge’s patrons, he studied old Polaroid photographs, their edges curled like the petals of forgotten flowers. <words>45</words>
Each image was a fragment of the endless night he sought to map, a task both subjectively rational and maddeningly elusive. <words>56</words>
The photographs revealed glimpses of the city’s hidden veins—tunnels where time bled into itself, and gardens where the air hummed with secrets. <words>69</words>

The garden secrets whispered in the photographs, their roots tangled in the soil of his doubt, urging him to dig deeper. <words>127</words>
He played his lute, its strings vibrating with the tension of the unseen, each note a thread in the tapestry of the night’s design. <words>141</words>

The map was taking shape, not on paper, but in the spaces between his breaths, in the pauses between his songs. <words>209</words>
The sky-lounge’s velvet walls absorbed his sighs, the fabric a metaphor for the night’s soft, suffocating embrace. <words>223</words>
He knew the endless night could not be contained, only navigated, its boundaries as fluid as the city’s ever-shifting heart. <words>237</words>
With a final glance at the broken watch band, he tucked the photographs into his coat, their weight a promise of the journey ahead. <words>251</words>
The minstrel stepped toward the lounge’s edge, where the city’s lights blurred into the horizon, a map of his own making. <words>264</words>
