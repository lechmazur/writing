<story>
In the underground city of the mole people, where the last star had long since burned out, Elias, an eternal college student studying immortality, adjusted the coal miner’s headlamp from a collapsed mine, its beam cutting through the perpetual gloom. <words>30</words>
The lamp was a relic, mundanely glorious in its simplicity, a gift from the elders who whispered of burdens that outlasted time. <words>40</words>
Elias carried a swapped travel journal, its pages filled with the digitized memories of those who had tried and failed to master their own reality. <words>55</words>
His motivation was not mere survival but transcendence, to become the architect of his existence in a world where even the mole people had forgotten the sky. <words>70</words>
The journal’s previous owner had scribbled frantically about the weight of eternity, a burden Elias now bore with detached devotion. <words>85</words>
He traced the tunnels, the headlamp’s glow revealing carvings of forgotten gods, their faces worn smooth by time. <words>95</words>
The mole people moved around him, their lives a cycle of digging and decay, oblivious to his quest. <words>105</words>
Elias paused at a cavern where the air hummed with the resonance of the last star’s dying light, preserved in the rocks. <words>118</words>
He opened the journal, its pages flickering with digitized echoes of past seekers, their voices a chorus of longing. <words>130</words>
The headlamp flickered as he read, its beam weakening, a reminder that even relics were not eternal. <words>140</words>
Elias understood then that immortality was not the absence of death but the mastery of one’s own narrative. <words>150</words>
He swapped his own journal with another left behind, his thoughts now part of the chain, a burden passed forward. <words>160</words>
The mole people watched in silence as he walked deeper into the tunnels, the headlamp’s glow fading behind him. <words>170</words>
They knew, as he did, that the underground city was a prison of time, and the only escape was to become its master. <words>185</words>
Elias reached the heart of the city, where the last embers of the star’s light pulsed in the walls. <words>195</words>
He pressed his palm to the stone, feeling the warmth of a universe long dead. <words>205</words>
The journal in his hand grew heavy, its pages now filled with his own digitized essence. <words>215</words>
The mole people bowed as he turned, his form flickering between flesh and light. <words>225</words>
Elias smiled, the headlamp’s beam now steady, a beacon in the endless dark. <words>235</words>
He had become the master of his reality, the burden of eternity no longer a weight but a crown. <words>245</words>
