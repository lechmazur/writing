The naive gambler, Elias, clutched the rustic candle mold like a lifeline, its wax-stained grooves whispering of unspoken bargains. <words>16</words>
He had docked at the tidal power monitoring station under a sky bleeding twilight, where the hum of turbines masked the weight of his debts. <words>28</words>
During candlelit dinners, the station’s crew laughed through tears, their stories as rarely predictable as the tides they harnessed. <words>38</words>
Elias had come to capture one last spark before oblivion, but the station’s unhinged professors—exiled for their rebellious midnight lectures—saw through him. <words>50</words>
“You think luck is a currency?” one cackled, slamming a rusted mold onto the table, its hollows filled with melted wax and secrets. <words>63</words>
The candle flickered, casting shadows that twisted like the bargains Elias had made—each one a gamble, each one a loss. <words>75</words>
The professors spoke of tides and time, of how the station’s power was a lie, a fleeting spark in the dark. <words>86</words>
Elias’s hands trembled as he poured wax into the mold, his reflection warping in the molten surface. <words>96</words>
“You’re not here to win,” another professor hissed, their voice a blade. “You’re here to burn.” <words>106</words>
The candle hardened, its shape a mockery of hope, and Elias understood: the station, the gamblers, the professors—they were all part of the same unspoken bargain. <words>123</words>
The tide surged, the turbines groaned, and the candle’s flame danced, laughing tears into the night. <words>134</words>
Elias lit it, the wax his final wager, the station his last dock before the dark. <words>143</words>
The professors watched, their lectures now silent, as the candle burned down, its spark a fleeting defiance. <words>155</words>
The tide swallowed the station whole, but Elias smiled, the mold empty, his debt paid in fire. <words>166</words>
The candle’s last flicker was a promise: oblivion was just another gamble, and he had finally won. <words>178</words>
The professors’ laughter echoed in the void, their rebellious lessons etched into the waves. <words>188</words>
Elias’s mold, now cold, held only the memory of wax, of bargains, of a spark that dared to burn. <words>199</words>
The station was gone, the tide indifferent, but the candle’s ghost lingered, a laughing tear in the dark. <words>211</words>
Somewhere, another gambler would dock, clutching a rustic mold, chasing a spark before oblivion. <words>223</words>
The professors would be waiting, their lectures sharp, their bargains unspoken but always paid. <words>234</words>
The tide would rise, the candle would burn, and the cycle would repeat, rarely predictable, always cruel. <words>246</words>
Elias’s story was just another flicker in the endless night, a spark captured, a debt settled. <words>257</words>
The candle mold, now empty, rolled into the tide, its purpose fulfilled, its lesson learned. <words>268</words>
The station’s hum faded, the professors’ laughter dissolved, and the dark welcomed Elias home. <words>279</words>
The candle’s last ember winked out, but the tide remembered, and the bargains lived on. <words>290</words>
Elias’s gamble was over, but the game was eternal, a laughing tear in the heart of the storm. <words>302</words>
The mold sank, the wax melted, and the station’s ghost whispered: *All sparks fade, but the tide endures.* <words>315</words>
Elias’s smile was the last light, a fleeting spark before the dark swallowed him whole. <words>327</words>
