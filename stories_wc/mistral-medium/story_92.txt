The dog walker for the ultra-rich paused at the threshold of the haunted mansion dining room, where the botanical collection sprawled like a forgotten empire. <words>20</words>
The air hummed with loud silence, thick with the weight of silent agreements made in the shadows of gilded frames. <words>30</words>
He was carefully careless, his boots scuffing the marble as he justified his presence—no one else would stand where fear dared not tread. <words>40</words>
The last light of day bled into night, staining the walls the color of old bruises, as he stepped deeper into the room. <words>50</words>
A blood drive had been held here once, he’d heard, though no one spoke of it—just another unspoken pact among the wealthy. <words>60</words>
His charge, a sleek greyhound named Vesper, sniffed at the dried petals of a black orchid, its scent like rust and secrets. <words>70</words>
The dog walker’s hands trembled, but he forced them still; he’d been hired to walk these halls, to pretend he belonged. <words>80</words>
A portrait above the fireplace watched him, its eyes hollow, as if it knew the truth: he was just another ghost in this house. <words>90</words>
Vesper whined, pressing against his leg, sensing the weight of the past pressing down like a storm about to break. <words>100</words>
He knelt, running his fingers over the botanical collection’s brittle leaves, each one a silent witness to the mansion’s sins. <words>110</words>
The ultra-rich paid him to walk their dogs, but he walked these halls for himself—for the thrill of defiance. <words>120</words>
A draft whispered through the room, carrying the scent of iron and old roses, and he knew the house was testing him. <words>130</words>
He stood, squaring his shoulders, and met the portrait’s gaze. “I’m not afraid,” he lied, his voice swallowed by the loud silence. <words>140</words>
Vesper growled low in his throat, but the dog walker only tightened his grip on the leash. <words>150</words>
The botanical collection seemed to shift, petals curling inward as if recoiling from his presence. <words>160</words>
He exhaled, the sound too loud in the hush, and forced himself to move forward, each step a silent agreement with the dark. <words>170</words>
The mansion’s heart pulsed around him, its walls breathing with the weight of unspoken truths. <words>180</words>
He had come to justify his place in this world, to prove he could walk where others wouldn’t. <words>190</words>
But as the last light faded, he wondered if the house had been waiting for him all along. <words>200</words>
Vesper’s ears twitched, and the dog walker followed his gaze to the far corner, where a single red rose lay on the table. <words>210</words>
It hadn’t been there before. <words>212</words>
His breath hitched, but he reached for it, his fingers brushing the velvet petals—only to find them cold as a corpse. <words>220</words>
The mansion sighed, and the portrait’s eyes flickered in the dark, as if amused by his defiance. <words>230</words>
He pocketed the rose, a trophy from the edge of fear, and turned to leave, Vesper close at his heels. <words>240</words>
The house let him go, but he knew it would call him back—because some silent agreements are never broken. <words>250</words>
