The town-weary traveler stumbled into the abandoned carnival house of mirrors, his boots crunching on shattered glass. <words>15</words>
The air smelled of salt and rust, the coastal wind tapping a loose metal sign against the frame, a hollow rhythm like a heartbeat. <words>25</words>
He traced his fingers over a stained glass panel, its fractured colors casting prismatic sparks across the warped reflections. <words>34</words>
This was the cradle of sparks, they called it—a place where light bent into something new, something alive. <words>43</words>
His breath fogged the glass, and for a moment, he saw not his own face but the ghost of someone he’d loved, someone he’d lost. <words>55</words>
The sign’s tapping grew louder, intentional yet accidental, as if the wind itself was trying to tell him something. <words>64</words>
He pressed his palm against the panel, feeling the vibrations hum through his bones, fertilizing the silence with possibility. <words>73</words>
In the hush before someone finally says, “I love you,” he understood why he’d come—to escape the confines of his mind. <words>84</words>
The mirrors whispered back, their distortions twisting his reflection into shapes he didn’t recognize, yet somehow knew. <words>94</words>
The stained glass pulsed, its colors bleeding into the air like ink in water, and he realized the cradle wasn’t just a place—it was a choice. <words>107</words>
He could stay here, trapped in the hammered repose of his own making, or he could step forward, into the light. <words>118</words>
The wind howled, the sign clanged, and the sparks danced, painting the walls with fleeting, fiery promises. <words>128</words>
He closed his eyes, letting the rhythm of the metal sign guide him, its tapping a bridge between what was and what could be. <words>140</words>
When he opened them again, the mirrors were still, the glass clear, and the weight in his chest had lifted. <words>150</words>
The cradle of sparks had done its work, not by magic, but by the simple, stubborn act of seeing. <words>161</words>
He turned toward the door, the coastal wind now a gentle push at his back, urging him onward. <words>170</words>
Outside, the world waited, vast and unbroken, no longer a prison but a path. <words>178</words>
The traveler took a breath, the taste of salt and rust still on his tongue, but lighter now, like the first word of a confession. <words>191</words>
He didn’t say it aloud, not yet, but the hush was over, and the next step was his to take. <words>201</words>
The stained glass behind him glowed one last time, a silent benediction, before the wind carried him away. <words>212</words>
The carnival faded into the dusk, its mirrors empty, its sparks spent, but the cradle remained, patient, waiting for the next weary soul. <words>226</words>
And somewhere, in the space between the tapping of the sign and the sigh of the sea, love began to take root. <words>238</words>
Not as an ending, but as a beginning, accidental and intentional, like the first spark in the dark. <words>249</words>
The traveler walked on, his shadow stretching long and sure, no longer a prisoner, but a pilgrim. <words>260</words>
