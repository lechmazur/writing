The ambivalent prophet stood in the lunar mining colony’s dim glow, his fingers tracing the cracked marbles in his palm, each fracture a whisper of the final oath he’d sworn. <words>25</words>
Between heartbeats, he felt the weight of the cosmic scoreboard pressing down, its numbers shifting like sand, and he knew he had to scramble them before the next pulse. <words>40</words>
His smile was happily sad, a contradiction only he understood, as he pulled a rummage sale box from the dust, its contents a jigsaw puzzle of edges waiting to be defragmented. <words>58</words>
The colony’s hum was a lullaby of machinery, but his mind raced with bashful arrogance, certain he alone could unravel the threads of fate woven into the marbles’ cracks. <words>76</words>
Each piece of the puzzle was a clue, a fragment of the oath’s true meaning, and as he fitted them together, the marbles glowed faintly, their light a rebellion against the colony’s sterile order. <words>98</words>
The miners passed him by, oblivious, their boots kicking up moon dust, but he paid them no mind—his focus was on the edges, the way they locked into place like a secret language. <words>118</words>
The final oath wasn’t just words; it was a pattern, a code, and the marbles were its cipher, their cracks mapping the fractures in the universe’s design. <words>136</words>
He laughed softly, the sound lost in the void, as the last puzzle piece clicked into place, the marbles aligning in his palm like a constellation. <words>154</words>
The cosmic scoreboard flickered, its numbers blurring, and for a moment, he saw the threads of fate unravel, the colony’s future rewritten in the space between heartbeats. <words>176</words>
But the prophet hesitated, his arrogance wavering—what if he was wrong? What if the oath demanded more than just defragmenting the pieces? <words>192</words>
The marbles pulsed, their cracks filling with light, and he knew the answer lay in the puzzle’s edges, in the way they fit together despite their flaws. <words>210</words>
With a deep breath, he scattered the marbles across the colony’s floor, their fragments catching the light like shattered stars, the final oath fulfilled in their chaos. <words>228</words>
The cosmic scoreboard reset, its numbers blank, and the prophet stood, happily sad, knowing he’d done what was necessary, even if no one else would ever understand. <words>248</words>
The miners would find the marbles tomorrow, their cracks a mystery, their purpose lost to time, but the prophet would be gone, his work done, his oath complete. <words>268</words>
Between heartbeats, the universe sighed, its balance restored, and the lunar colony hummed on, unaware of the prophet’s quiet triumph. <words>284</words>
He left the puzzle box behind, its edges worn smooth, a relic of the moment when the cosmic scoreboard had been scrambled, and the prophet had become something more than just a man. <words>300</words>
