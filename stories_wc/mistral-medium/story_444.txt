She had come to indoctrinate them—not with force, but with the quiet weight of truth. <words>58</words>
The illusions they clung to for comfort were fragile, like the ghost costume, like the letters. <words>68</words>
The zeppelin groaned, its bones shifting in the abyss, as if resisting the hush she sought to bring. <words>78</words>
