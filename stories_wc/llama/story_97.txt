In the cradle of a whispered minute, where time itself was a fragile, flickering flame, the fact-minded oracle, Kaida, stood at the edge of an unstable dimension, her eyes fixed on the brass compass in her hand. <words>29</words>

The needle spun wildly, as if trying to keep pace with the dimension's erratic pulse, but Kaida's grip remained steady, her desperation masked by a casually raised eyebrow. <words>43</words>

She was on a quest to find forgotten places, hidden pockets of reality that only revealed themselves to those who knew where to look, and the compass was her key. <words>59</words>

The brass compass still clutched in her hand seemed to pulse with an otherworldly energy now, guiding her through the shadows towards a brighter future. <words>188</words>
