The sun had long since set on the ethereal plains, casting a warm orange glow over the barren landscape. <words>19</words> Kael, a grizzled apocalyptic farmer, sat cross-legged on the dusty ground, his eyes fixed on the small, weathered deck of cards in his hands. <words>31</words> It was a magician's deck, one he had found buried in the ruins of a forgotten city, and he had spent countless hours studying the intricate tricks and illusions hidden within its worn cards. <words>49</words>

As he shuffled the deck with a practiced hand, Kael's mind wandered to the song of boundaries, a haunting melody that seemed to echo across the desolate expanse of the plains. <words>64</words> It was a song he had heard only once, carried on the wind like a whispered secret, but it had left an indelible mark on his soul. <words>78</words> The song spoke of freedom, of escape from the suffocating grip of a life dictated by another, and Kael felt its call deep in his bones. <words>94</words>

He had always been a typically atypical man, content to till the soil and coax new life from the ashes of the old world. <words>109</words> But as the last resource war had ravaged the planet, leaving behind only scars and silence, Kael had begun to feel the weight of his own boundaries. <words>125</words> He longed to break free from the constraints of his small farm, to explore the unknown reaches of the plains and discover what lay beyond the horizon. <words>143</words>

And so, he had taken to sending messages in bottles, carried by the sea that lapped at the edges of the plains like a restless beast. <words>157</words> It was a quixotic endeavor, perhaps, but Kael felt a sense of raw solace in the act of releasing his thoughts and dreams into the void. <words>172</words> He would jabber on for hours, pouring his heart onto scraps of paper that would be swept away by the tides, never to be seen again. <words>188</words>

Yet, even as he spoke to the wind and waves, Kael felt a sense of connection to something greater than himself. <words>203</words> The song of boundaries still echoed in his mind, a reminder that there was more to life than the narrow confines of his farm. <words>219</words> And as he sat there, surrounded by the endless expanse of the ethereal plains, Kael knew that he would continue to send his messages into the void, hoping against hope that someone, somewhere, would hear his call and respond in kind. <words>244</words>

The stars were beginning to twinkle in the night sky as Kael finally rose to his feet, his joints creaking with a soft protest. <words>259</words> He tucked the magician's deck into his pocket and began to walk, his footsteps carrying him away from the farm and into the unknown. <words>275</words>

The song of boundaries swelled in his heart as he walked, its melody intertwining with the rustle of the wind through the grasses and the distant crash of waves against the shore. <word295></word295>

And when he finally vanished into the darkness, it was as if he had never been there at all â€“ except for the small trail of footprints leading out into infinity and beyond. 314
