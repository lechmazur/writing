The air was heavy with the scent of ozone and decay, but Elian's focus remained unwavering as he tinkered with his latest creation: a brass bell adorned with intricate etchings that seemed to shimmer in the dim light. <words>46</words>

As he worked, the distant hum of a radio broadcast drifted through the air, a melancholic melody that seemed to echo the rhythm of Elian's own heartbeat. <words>59</words>
