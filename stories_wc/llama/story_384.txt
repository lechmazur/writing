With the worn pencil eraser still clutched in her hand, Emma vowed to expose the root of all illusions, to shatter the facade and reveal the truth to a world that had been living in darkness. <words>192</words> The earthquake prediction facility, once a bastion of science and reason, had become a beacon of hope for Emma, a place where she could subvert the status quo and uncover the secrets that lay hidden beneath the surface. <words>209</words>
