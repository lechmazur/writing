In the ancient Persian palace, reimagined with crumbling stone and overgrown gardens, a weary undertaker named Kaveh stood before the astronomical clock, its intricate mechanisms a testament to the ingenuity of a bygone era. <words>29</words>

The clock's face, adorned with symbols of the zodiac, seemed to mock Kaveh with its silence, as if it too had given up on the passage of time. <words>43</words>

As he gazed upon the clock, Kaveh's thoughts turned to the tribal knowledge that had been passed down through his family for generations - the art of navigating the darkest of times by following the sun's paths. <words>63</words>

It was a knowledge that had proven rarely practical in his line of work, but one that brought him solace in moments like these, when the world seemed to have lost its way. <words>80</words>

The sudden stillness that followed the car backfiring in the silent street outside only served to heighten Kaveh's sense of unease, and he felt an overwhelming urge to imprison the darkness that threatened to consume him. <words>103</words>

With a placid ferocity, Kaveh set to work, using the astronomical clock as his guide, tracing the sun's paths across the palace walls, and slowly but surely, a sense of hope began to seep back into his weary soul. <words>126</words>

As the silence outside seemed to grow thicker, like a palpable fog, Kaveh's determination only intensified, his movements becoming more deliberate, more precise, as if he was conjuring a spell to hold onto hope in the absolute dark. <words>150</words>

The clock's mechanisms, once silent, now seemed to whisper secrets in Kaveh's ear, urging him on as he worked tirelessly to imprison the shadows that sought to claim him. <words>168</words>

And when finally, the darkness began to recede, and the first light of dawn crept over the palace walls, Kaveh stood back, exhausted but triumphant, knowing that he had held onto hope, no matter how tenuous, in the face of overwhelming despair. <words>193</words>

In that moment, the astronomical clock seemed to come alive, its symbols glowing with a soft light, as if acknowledging Kaveh's unyielding spirit, and the tribal knowledge that had guided him through the darkest of nights. <words>214</words>

As the sun rose higher in the sky, casting its warm rays upon the palace, Kaveh smiled wearily, knowing that he would face another day, armed with the knowledge of his ancestors, and the unyielding ferocity of his own heart. <words>236</words>
