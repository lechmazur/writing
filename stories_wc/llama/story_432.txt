As a member of a hidden society, she had been tasked with uncovering the secrets of the mysterious energy flows that pulsed through the earth. <words>58</words> Her method was unorthodox - she interpreted frantic calls to talk-radio psychics, searching for patterns and clues that might lead her to the source of the energy. <words>74</words> It was a strangely compelling task, one that drew her in with an otherworldly allure. <words>86</words>
