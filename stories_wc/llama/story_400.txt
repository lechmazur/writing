In the glacial orchard suspended over a crevasse of blue ice, a lone figure emerged from the frozen trees, their features obscured by a hood and a mask of frost. <words>29</words> The air was heavy with the weight of silence, a silence that had lasted for centuries, ever since the last human had set foot on earth. <words>43</words> The figure, a guarded druid, moved with a quiet purpose, their eyes fixed on the ground as they searched for something. <words>56</words>

As they walked, the druid's hand absently toyed with a dull safety pin, a token from a long-forgotten era. <words>66</words> It was a reminder of the world that once was, a world that had been lost to the ravages of time and neglect. <words>78</words> The druid's thoughts were consumed by a crippling fear, one that had haunted them for centuries: the fear of being alone. <words>91</words>

But today was different. Today was a birthday, and the druid had decided to gather what little remained of their family to celebrate. <words>104</words> They had prepared a special meal, one that had been passed down through generations of druids, a meal that was only prepared on birthdays. <words>118</words> The druid's fiercely ambivalent nature made them both eager and terrified to break the silence that had lasted for so long. <words>132</words>

As they approached the gathering place, the druid could feel the weight of their fear bearing down on them. <words>144</words> But they steeled themselves and began to speak, their voice barely above a whisper. <words>153</words> "Hello?" they said, the word echoing through the stillness like a crack in the ice. <words>162</words>

The response was immediate. A chorus of voices, some familiar, some not, replied in kind, their words tumbling out in a joyful cacophony. <words>175</words> The druid's fear began to dissipate, replaced by a sense of wonder and belonging. <words>188</words> They realized that they were not alone, that there were others out there who shared their hopes and fears. <words>202</words>

As they sat down to eat, the druid couldn't help but feel a sense of dour amusement at the absurdity of it all. <words>215</words> Who would have thought that a simple meal could break the silence that had lasted for so long? <words>229</words> But as they looked around at their gathered family, the druid knew that it was exactly what they needed. <words>243</words>

The meal was a success, and the druid's fear began to fade away, replaced by a sense of purpose and belonging. <words>257</words> As they finished their food and began to disperse, the druid knew that they would never be alone again. <words>271</words>

And so, in the glacial orchard suspended over a crevasse of blue ice, the druid found a new sense of hope, one that would carry them through the long, dark days ahead. <word s 291></word s>
