In the heart of the giant's workshop, where the scent of molten metal and freshly cut wood filled the air, an unsure archivist named Elian delved into the dusty recesses of forgotten history. <words>29</words> With a precisely playful glint in his eye, he navigated the labyrinthine paths that crisscrossed the workshop, searching for clues to unmask the secrets of a bygone era. <words>44</words> His fingers trailed over the intricate carvings that adorned the walls, tracing the patterns that had been etched into the stone throughout the golden age of the giant's craftsmanship. <words>61</words>
