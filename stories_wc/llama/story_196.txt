The monks at the monastery watched him go, their faces filled with a mix of confusion and admiration. <words>226</words> They knew that Kaito was a complex individual, one who wore his apathy like a mask to hide his true feelings. <words>241</words> But as they saw him disappear into the distance, they realized that he was more than just a tired swordsman â€“ he was a warrior with a hidden promise to keep. <words>258</words>

As Kaito vanished into the night, the meteor shower continued to streak across the sky, a reminder of the spark of defiance that burned within him. <words>273</words>
