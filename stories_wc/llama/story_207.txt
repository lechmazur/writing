As the universe hummed its secret song, a lone figure wandered through the abandoned space station, her footsteps echoing off the cold metal walls. <words>19</words> She was a forthright peddler, known for her meekly assertive nature, and she had come to this forsaken place in search of something - or someone. <words>31</words> Her name was Aria, and she carried a dried flower bouquet in her hand, its petals crumbling to dust as she moved. <words>41</words>

Aria's eyes scanned the deserted corridors, her heart heavy with the weight of an oath sealed in blood. <words>50</words> She had sworn to never again set foot on this station, to never again confront the demons that lurked within its walls. <words>62</words> But rumors had begun to circulate, whispers of a mysterious figure hiding in the shadows, waiting for redemption. <words>73</words>

Determined to uncover the truth, Aria made her way to the medical bay, where she began to sift through the rumor-laden gossip columns that littered the floor. <words>86</words> The words blurred together on the pages, but one phrase caught her eye: "Redemption's path begins with division." <words>98</words>

Aria's heart skipped a beat as she realized what she had to do. <words>105</words> She took a deep breath and began to divide the dried flowers, separating them into two bouquets. <words>116</words> As she worked, a sense of joyful loneliness washed over her, a feeling that she was finally taking control of her own destiny. <words>129</words>

The universe hummed on, its secret song weaving in and out of Aria's thoughts as she worked. <words>139</words> She was no longer bound by her oath, no longer held captive by the fears that had once consumed her. <words>151</words>

With the bouquets divided, Aria stood up, her eyes shining with a newfound sense of purpose. <words>162</words> She knew that redemption's path would not be easy, but she was ready to face whatever lay ahead. <words>174</words>

As she walked out of the medical bay, the abandoned space station seemed less desolate, less forsaken. <words>186</words> Aria felt a sense of hope rising within her, a sense that she was not alone in this vast and mysterious universe. <words>200</words>

The dried flower bouquets seemed to symbolize her newfound freedom, and Aria smiled as she gazed at them. <words>212</words>

She took one last look at the medical bay before disappearing into the unknown reaches of space. <word count 224></word count>
