In the soundless sanctuary, a place where the only sound was the soft hum of fluorescent lights, a young woman named Ava sat with her worn leather glove-clad hand grasping a stolen phone. <words>29</words> She was a dutiful ward, tasked with caring for the sanctuary's inhabitants, but her mind wandered to the auditions that had been taking place throughout the week. <words>43</words> As an eagerly jaded individual, Ava had grown tired of the same old routines and sought excitement in the most unlikely of places. <words>58</words>
