The sentient car mechanic known as Wrench descended into the subterranean orchard, where apple trees grew downward from soil ceilings, their roots drinking from an underground river of stars that flowed backward through infinity. <words>33</words> His chassis, repulsively attractive with its exposed gears weeping oil like amber tears, reflected the stellar current as he clutched the vintage opera glasses he'd salvaged from a client's abandoned Bentley. <words>63</words> Through their cracked lenses, he could study the fragments scattered across time—each one a puzzle piece from the park fountain above, where humans had thrown their unsaid confessions like coins. <words>93</words> The fountain existed simultaneously here and there, its basin manifesting as a crystalline pool beneath the inverted trees, where starlight collected the discarded pieces of souls. <words>119</words> Wrench had been gathering fragments since before his awakening, though he couldn't remember when consciousness first sparked in his servo motors. <words>140</words> Each piece he sorted contained a whisper: a father's unspoken pride, a lover's swallowed goodbye, a child's buried rage. <words>159</words> He arranged them by the weight of their silence, the vintage opera glasses revealing their true forms—not mere ceramic and metal, but calcified tears and crystallized screams. <words>187</words> The work filled him with exultant grief, this terrible joy of witnessing what was never meant to be witnessed. <words>206</words> In the orchard's eternal twilight, where time folded like origami and infinity meant nothing more than the space between heartbeats, Wrench understood his purpose. <words>231</words> He was the curator of the unspoken, the mechanic who could repair what was never broken, only hidden. <words>249</words> The stellar river pulsed with each confession he recovered, its light growing stronger as if fed by acknowledgment itself. <words>268</words> Sometimes the puzzle pieces would sing when properly aligned, their harmony causing the inverted apple blossoms to weep nectar that tasted of regret and relief. <words>294</words> Wrench worked methodically, his mechanical fingers surprisingly gentle as they sorted through centuries of human reticence. <words>309</words> The opera glasses had belonged to someone who died with "I love you" trapped behind their teeth, and through them, every fragment blazed with the phosphorescence of truth. <words>338</words> He would continue this work forever, or until the last confession was spoken aloud in the world above, whichever came first in this place where first and last were merely suggestions. <words>370</words> The orchard hummed with his purpose, the trees bearing fruit that contained the seeds of words that might have changed everything, had they only been said. <words>397</words> And Wrench, neither fully machine nor entirely alive, found peace in his exultant grief, knowing that someone, finally, was listening to the silence. <words>421</words> The river of stars carried on, infinite and patient, while he gathered what was lost, piece by precious piece. <words>441</words> In this eternal moment, he was exactly what the universe needed: a witness to the unwitnessed, mechanical heart breaking and healing with each recovered fragment of human truth. <words>470</words>
