Marcus hunched over his laptop in the corner booth, the diner's fluorescent lights casting harsh shadows across his face. <words>16</words> The wooden whistle in his pocket pressed against his thigh—a reminder of his grandfather's craft, one of many forgotten arts lost to digital convenience. <words>40</words>

"More coffee?" <words>42</words> The waitress's voice made him flinch. <words>48</words>

"Please," he mumbled, pushing his glasses up. <words>55</words>

She poured, eyeing his screen's cascade of encrypted messages. <words>64</words> "Working late?" <words>66</words>

Marcus nodded, unable to explain he was reversing trails through an archive of coded correspondence from the 1970s—messages between artisans who'd predicted their skills would vanish. <words>92</words> They'd hidden blueprints, techniques, knowledge, all encrypted in what appeared to be mundane letters about weather and groceries. <words>110</words>

He was hopefully cynical about the whole endeavor. <words>118</words> Hope that these forgotten masters had left something worth salvaging; cynicism that modern society would care. <words>134</words> But he had to try. <words>139</words> His regret over abandoning his grandfather's woodworking lessons gnawed at him like termites. <words>152</words>

The whistle had been his grandfather's last gift. <words>160</words> "When machines replace hands," the old man had said, "someone must remember how to make music from wood." <words>178</words>

Marcus cracked another layer of encryption. <words>184</words> The message revealed itself slowly: instructions for preserving hand-carved musical instruments, written by someone who signed themselves "The Reaper." <words>203</words> Not death's reaper, but one who harvested knowledge before it rotted in unmarked graves. <words>217</words>

His fingers trembled as he decoded more. <words>224</words> The Reaper had worked through reversed trails too—starting with modern techniques and working backward to rediscover ancient methods. <words>242</words> They'd documented everything: wood selection, carving angles, the relationship between grain and sound. <words>255</words>

Marcus pulled out the whistle, turned it over. <words>263</words> His grandfather's initials were carved there, but underneath—barely visible—were older marks. <words>275</words> The Reaper's signature. <words>278</words>

His grandfather had been part of this network. <words>286</words>

The realization hit him like cold coffee. <words>293</words> He'd spent years regretting not learning, building a tree of regret so tall it blocked out everything else. <words>311</words> But his grandfather had left him more than a whistle—he'd left him a map. <words>325</words>

Marcus began typing, adding his own discoveries to the archive. <words>335</words> He would reap what remained of these forgotten arts, not to mourn them but to plant them anew. <words>353</words> The late shift stretched ahead, the diner's restless energy matching his own. <words>365</words> He accepted what was lost but refused to let it all disappear. <words>377</words>

The waitress refilled his cup again, and this time Marcus managed a crooked smile. <words>391</words> "Long night ahead," he said, fingers already dancing across keys, chopping down regret and building something better. <words>408</words>
