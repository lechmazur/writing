The unruly alchemist Meridian adjusted her cracked magnifying glass, squinting through its fractured lens at the constellation charts. <words>16</words> Her laboratory coat, stained with phosphorescent compounds and meteor dust, fluttered as she moved through the abandoned shooting star tracking station. <words>36</words> 

"Between innings," she muttered, checking the ancient wall clock that still somehow kept perfect time. <words>51</words> The baseball game in the valley below had paused, which meant exactly seventeen minutes before the electromagnetic interference from the stadium lights would resume. <words>75</words> She needed to work quickly, but with infinite caution—one mistake and her experiment to recreate the touched sky phenomenon would fail spectacularly. <words>98</words>

The touched sky had appeared only once, seventy years ago, when aurora borealis descended low enough for a child to brush it with her fingertips. <words>123</words> That child had grown up hauntingly cheerful, speaking in colors and tasting symphonies, forever changed by that ethereal contact. <words>142</words> The scientific community dismissed it as folklore, their cynicism as thick as winter fog. <words>157</words>

Meridian positioned the outdated overhead projector she'd salvaged from a demolished school. <words>169</words> Its hum filled the observatory dome, a droning meditation that somehow amplified stellar frequencies when combined with her alchemical solutions. <words>189</words> She'd discovered this by accident, naturally—all her best discoveries came from magnificent failures. <words>203</words>

Through the cracked lens, she watched her precisely measured compounds begin to shimmer on the projector's glass plate. <words>221</words> The fracture in the magnifying glass split the light into seven distinct streams, each one reaching toward the open observatory dome like fingers of possibility. <words>247</words>

"Come on," she whispered, her voice carrying that same hauntingly cheerful quality she'd cultivated to disarm the cynicism of her skeptical peers. <words>270</words> She needed to impress them, yes, but more importantly, she needed to remind them that playful wonder hadn't died with childhood. <words>292</words>

The hum intensified, harmonizing with something beyond human hearing. <words>301</words> Above, the tracked shooting stars began to slow their trajectories, curving impossibly against physics. <words>316</words> The light streams from her cracked lens reached upward, upward, until—

Contact. <words>328</words>

The sky lowered itself like a curious cat, aurora ribbons descending through the dome. <words>343</words> Meridian laughed—a sound of pure, infectious joy—as the touched sky phenomenon recreated itself before her eyes. <words>360</words> She reached out with infinite caution, her fingers trembling as they approached the luminous cascade. <words>376</words>

The moment her skin met the light, she understood why that child had emerged hauntingly cheerful. <words>393</words> The universe was playing, had always been playing, and cynicism was just fear of joining the game. <words>411</words> 

The stadium lights flickered on in the distance. <words>419</words> The experiment ended, but Meridian's work had just begun. <words>428</words> Tomorrow, she would bring the others here, between innings, to touch wonder itself. <words>442</words>
