Marlowe clutched his worn-out dinosaur plush, its purple fabric threadbare from decades of nervous fidgeting, as he descended into the xenon-lit tunnel beneath the city's abandoned opera house. <words>23</words>

The harsh blue-white light made everything look like a memory already fading, which seemed fitting for December 31st, 2029—the year everyone would rather forget, when the dream plague had stolen half the world's ability to sleep naturally. <words>62</words>

"You're the last bard left who remembers the old songs," Dr. Chen had told him, gesturing toward the chrome dream-hopping machines that lined the tunnel like sleeping metal gods. <words>91</words>

Marlowe was hesitant by nature, a contradiction wrapped in leather and doubt—shyly loud, his therapist once called him, someone who whispered his introductions but screamed his ballads. <words>118</words>

The dinosaur, named Rex after simpler times, had been his sister's before the plague took her mind and scattered it across seventeen different dreamscapes. <words>142</words>

Now he stood before Machine Seven, knowing that to motivate the other trapped dreamers to wake, he'd have to sing through their nightmares, unraveling the tapestry woven from their collective sorrow thread by careful thread. <words>177</words>

How magnificently absurd, he thought with ironic awe, that humanity's salvation rested on a man who still carried a stuffed animal for comfort. <words>200</words>

The machine's neural crown felt cold against his temples as he settled into the reclining chair, Rex pressed against his chest like armor made of childhood. <words>226</words>

"Time is more fragile than we ever imagined," Dr. Chen's voice crackled through the intercom, "and you're about to learn just how easily it breaks." <words>251</words>

The first dream hit him like diving into frozen honey—thick, sweet, and utterly wrong. <words>266</words>

He found himself in a ballroom where everyone danced backward, their faces aging and youthing with each spin, the fragility of time made literal in their shifting features. <words>295</words>

His voice emerged tentatively at first, then stronger, that shyly loud quality serving him perfectly as he sang the song his sister had taught him before words meant anything. <words>324</words>

The dancers began to slow, their eyes focusing on him with recognition that sparked like xenon flares. <words>341</words>

Dream by dream, nightmare by nightmare, Marlowe traveled through the collective unconscious, his hesitant nature becoming his strength—he understood fear, understood the desire to hide. <words>365</words>

In the final dreamscape, he found his sister building castles from crystallized tears. <words>378</words>

She looked at Rex in his arms and smiled, remembering. <words>388</words>

"Sing us home, little brother," she whispered. <words>395</words>

And so he did, his voice unraveling sorrow's tapestry until the new year dawned and the sleepers finally woke, forever changed by a hesitant bard who'd been brave enough to carry a dinosaur through the dark. <words>432</words>

The machines powered down with sighs like dying stars, and somewhere above, 2030 began with the strange miracle of people dreaming their own dreams again. <words>457</words>

Marlowe emerged from the tunnel, Rex still in his arms, humming softly into the light. <words>472</words>
