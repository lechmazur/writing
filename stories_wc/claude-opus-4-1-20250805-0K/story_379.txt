Marcus Chen stretched against the hydroponic corn stalks, their synthetic chlorophyll glowing faintly in the biodome's artificial dawn. <words>16</words> The leftover gift tag in his pocket read "For the one who remembers" – a cryptic dare from Lily, his high school rival turned corporate hunter. <words>42</words> She'd found him again, even here in AgriDome Seven, where he'd been documenting the last speakers of Terran dialects before the Unity Language mandate erased them forever. <words>69</words>

He was impatiently patient, a contradiction that had served him well as both trickster lawyer and fugitive. <words>86</words> The stretching routine was cover; every morning, he interviewed Old Henrik, the dome's maintenance chief who spoke fragments of Norwegian-Mandarin pidgin, a language with only three living speakers. <words>114</words> Marcus had diverted corporate security seventeen times using fabricated legal precedents, but Lily's dares were different – she knew his real mission. <words>136</words>

"The corn remembers winter," Henrik whispered in his dying tongue, bending beside Marcus. <words>149</words> Marcus's neural implant translated automatically, but he fought it, letting the raw sounds imprint on his memory. <words>167</words> This was why he'd abandoned his practice, why he'd stolen the Linguistic Preservation Archive from the very corporations now hunting him. <words>189</words>

Another gift tag appeared on the greenhouse panel: "Remember debate finals?" <words>200</words> Lily was close. <words>203</words> In high school, she'd dared him to argue impossible positions – that silence was speech, that forgetting was remembering. <words>222</words> Now she was hunting him with the same paradoxical logic. <words>233</words>

Henrik continued in his ghost language, describing seasons that no longer existed outside history files. <words>249</words> Marcus recorded every syllable with desperate precision, knowing that when Henrik died, these words would exist only in his stolen archive. <words>270</words> The biodome's crops grew in eternal spring, but languages died in permanent winter. <words>284</words>

"She's in Section C," Henrik suddenly said in perfect Standard. <words>295</words> "Your rival. She asked about you in old words I taught her." <words>308</words> Marcus felt his ghostly resolve crystallize – Lily wasn't hunting him; she was leading corporate security away. <words>326</words> The gift tags weren't taunts but warnings, each dare a diversion. <words>338</words>

He found her by the vertical wheat fields, stretching like they were still seventeen. <words>353</words> "You chose your path," she said, her voice carrying the weight of abandoned courtrooms. <words>368</words> "I chose mine. But some paths run parallel." <words>377</words> She handed him a data chip. <words>384</words> "Forty-seven more speakers, scattered across the northern domes. Security will chase me south for weeks." <words>400</words>

Marcus pocketed the chip beside the gift tag, understanding finally that some rivalries were just another form of alliance. <words>419</words> As Lily disappeared into the corn maze, he returned to Henrik, ready to catalogue every word before silence claimed them all. <words>440</words> The biodome's atmosphere hummed with artificial life, but real preservation happened in whispered conversations between those who refused to forget. <words>461</words>
