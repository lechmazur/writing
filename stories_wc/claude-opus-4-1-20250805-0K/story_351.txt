The brass sundial lay half-buried beneath ivy tendrils, its gnomon casting no shadow in the perpetual twilight of the abandoned station. <words>18</words> Margot traced her fingers along its Roman numerals, remembering how her grandmother had once stood here, waiting for trains that would never return. <words>41</words>

She was a dreamy poet by nature, but formally rebellious by necessity—the kind who wore Victorian mourning dress to climate protests and scrawled verses on government buildings in chalk. <words>70</words> The station had drawn her for months, this monument to forgotten departures, where rust-eaten tracks disappeared into walls of green. <words>90</words>

The letter had arrived yesterday, sealed with burgundy wax. <words>99</words> Within its impression lay cryptic shapes: a crescent moon cradling a broken clock, surrounded by words in a script she couldn't read. <words>121</words> The shapes seemed to shift when she wasn't looking directly at them, compelling her to this precise location after weeks of solving riddles left in library margins and carved into park benches. <words>154</words>

Now, after the last riddle was solved—something about "where time stops but never ends"—she understood. <words>170</words> The sundial wasn't measuring hours anymore; it was marking the delicate undoing of memory itself. <words>185</words>

Her grandmother had been the station's last telegraph operator, tapping out messages as the world shifted from rails to roads. <words>206</words> Nobody remembered her now, or the hundreds like her who had given their youth to these platforms and waiting rooms. <words>226</words> The ivy had consumed their stories, drawing them up through its roots and storing them in leaves that whispered with each breeze. <words>249</words>

Margot opened the letter at last, the wax crumbling like dried blood. <words>262</words> Inside, her grandmother's handwriting bloomed across yellowed paper: "To stand by the unremembered is to become the memory itself." <words>281</words>

The words compelled her forward, not with force but with the quiet intensity of recognition. <words>297</words> She understood now why she'd been chosen—her poems weren't just art but acts of preservation, each verse a small rebellion against forgetting. <words>320</words>

Setting the letter on the sundial, she watched as the ivy began to curl around it, gently, deliberately. <words>339</words> This was how the unremembered persisted: through careful tending by those who refused to let absence become erasure. <words>357</words> The station wasn't abandoned; it was waiting, holding space for all the departures and arrivals that existed now only in the dreams of poets. <words>382</words>

Margot pulled out her notebook and began to write, chronicling each ghost that moved through the ivy's shadows, each name the brass had forgotten, transforming their delicate undoing into something eternal. <words>413</words> The sundial's shadow finally appeared, pointing not to any hour but to her, marking her as the keeper of this quietly intense vigil. <words>437</words> She would return tomorrow, and the day after, standing by the unremembered until she too became part of the station's endless, essential waiting. <words>461</words>
