Mara's fingers trembled as she shuffled the magician's deck of trick cards, each one painted with seeds that had never existed before the last resource war. <words>24</words> The ethereal plains stretched endlessly around her makeshift greenhouse, their ghostly wheat swaying to frequencies only the dead could hear. <words>43</words> She had inherited this typically atypical existence from her mother—not by choice, but by the iron chains of genetic modification contracts that bound three generations to the Consortium's will. <words>72</words>

Every morning, she would jabber nonsense syllables while planting, a ritual her mother claimed confused the surveillance drones that still patrolled these wastelands. <words>95</words> But Mara knew better; the jabber was actually the song of boundaries, an ancient frequency that taught seeds where their cells should stop and start, where root ended and stem began. <words>126</words> Without it, her creations would grow wild, formless, useless to anyone seeking food in this scorched aftermath. <words>143</words>

The bottles began arriving six months ago, washing up on the salt-crusted shores where the ethereal plains met what remained of the Pacific. <words>167</words> Each contained a message from other farmers like her, apocalyptic gardeners breeding impossible life from radioactive soil. <words>184</words> "The Consortium tracks standard genomes," one read. <words>191</words> "Breed chaos. Breed freedom." <words>195</words>

She drew a card from the deck—the Seven of Germination—and pressed it against a seed pod. <words>212</words> The trick wasn't magic but chemistry; each card contained enzyme codes that rewrote DNA like poetry, creating plants that could grow in ash, in salt, in memories of rain. <words>242</words> These seeds would be her escape, not through running, but through obsolescence. <words>254</words> If she could breed enough variation, enough beautiful chaos, the Consortium's systems wouldn't recognize her crops as theirs. <words>272</words> The contracts would become meaningless paper. <words>278</words>

As dawn broke over the ethereal plains, Mara planted her newest creation: a grain that sang its own boundaries, that would teach itself where to grow and when to stop. <words>308</words> She wrote her own message, sealed it in a bottle with three precious seeds, and walked to the shore. <words>328</words> The water accepted her offering with ancient indifference. <words>336</words>

Somewhere, another farmer would receive her gift, plant her rebellion, and continue the work of unmaking the world that owned them. <words>357</words> Mara returned to her greenhouse and drew another card, the Fool reversed—new beginnings from endings. <words>372</words> She pressed it to her chest and felt something she hadn't in years: raw solace, the harsh comfort of knowing that tomorrow's seeds would be entirely hers, bred from hope and spite in equal measure. <words>407</words> The song of boundaries hummed through her bones, teaching her exactly where servitude ended and freedom began. <words>424</words>
