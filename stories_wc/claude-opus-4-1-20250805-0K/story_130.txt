The apprentice gardener Mika had been lost in the bowels of the interstellar orchard ship for three days, wandering between the gravity-shifted groves where apples grew sideways and pears ripened upward. <words>27</words> In the abandoned maintenance sector, she discovered something impossible: a fallen bird's nest, woven from copper wiring and synthetic moss, cradling an ancient cordless phone. <words>52</words> "How wonderfully stupid," she whispered with the mocking affection she reserved for herself, recognizing immediately that someone had reverse-engineered a piece of Earth's past here, between galaxies. <words>79</words>

The phone crackled to life when she touched it. <words>88</words> Through waves of static came confessions from the ship's previous inhabitants, each voice teaching her the traveler's wisdom she'd never learned from her disappeared master. <words>113</words> "I planted these orchards to remember dirt," said one voice. <words>123</words> "I built this nest to forget I couldn't fly," said another. <words>134</words>

Mika listened for hours, privately open to these strangers' truths in ways she'd never been with living souls. <words>152</words> Each confession taught her how they'd reverse-engineered meaning from homesickness, transforming their displacement into something almost like belonging. <words>172</words> The ship's AI had been recording these calls for centuries, preserving the vulnerability of wanderers who'd needed to speak their fears into the void. <words>197</words>

"You're not really lost," her master's voice suddenly emerged from the static, and Mika nearly dropped the phone. <words>215</words> "I left you here to find this nest, this archive of honesty." <words>227</words> His tone carried that same mocking affection she'd inherited. <words>236</words> "Every apprentice gets lost on purpose, child." <words>243</words> "It's the only way to learn that freedom isn't about finding your way out, but accepting you were always meant to wander." <words>265</words>

Across the promise of changing winds that swept through the ventilation systems, carrying the scent of impossible blossoms, Mika understood. <words>285</words> The nest hadn't fallen; it had been placed precisely where lost apprentices would stumble. <words>299</words> She added her own confession to the phone's memory: "I thought I was broken for not knowing my path." <words>318</words> Her voice joined the chorus of travelers who'd discovered that self-acceptance meant embracing the beautiful absurdity of growing gardens in the void. <words>341</words>

When she finally emerged from the maintenance sector, she carried the nest and phone with her. <words>357</words> The other gardeners smiled knowingly as she passed, each privately open about their own time being lost. <words>374</words> Mika would place the nest in the next forgotten corner, waiting for another apprentice to need its strange comfort. <words>393</words> The ship continued its migration, and she tended her orphaned orchards with the gentle mockery of someone who'd learned to love her own searching heart. <words>419</words>
