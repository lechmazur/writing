The shapeshifter Kaine drummed translucent fingers against the taxi's rain-streaked window, watching the ruins of the Last Empire blur past through sheets of water. <words>19</words>

Three centuries of perfect mimicry had left him catastrophically bored—until today. <words>31</words>

Beside him, a hooded figure clutched a chipped obsidian figurine, its fractured surface pulsing with imprisoned starlight. <words>48</words>

"The Harmonic Caves," Kaine told the driver, his voice shifting between seven different timbres. <words>62</words>

The stranger turned sharply. <words>66</words>

"You're going there too?" <words>70</words>

Her eyes held the telltale shimmer of rare talents—those born after the Empire's fall with abilities that defied old physics. <words>89</words>

"To overthrow what remains of cosmic order?" <words>96</words>

Kaine grinned, his face rippling. <words>101</words>

"Something like that." <words>104</words>

The taxi hydroplaned through abandoned checkpoints where imperial guards once demanded papers from travelers whose talents threatened stability. <words>122</words>

Now only rain ruled these roads. <words>128</words>

"That figurine," Kaine said, recognizing its true nature with the intelligently foolish certainty of someone who'd lived too long. <words>147</words>

"It's a Resonance Key, isn't it?" <words>153</words>

She nodded slowly. <words>156</words>

"The last one." <words>159</words>

"And you think activating it in the Caves will shift the balance—give the talented supremacy over the mundane." <words>177</words>

"Don't you?" <words>179</words>

She studied him with sudden suspicion. <words>185</words>

"Unless you're one of them—the Equalizers, trying to strip talents from existence entirely." <words>198</words>

Kaine laughed, a sound like breaking glass and singing wind. <words>208</words>

"I'm neither." <words>210</words>

His form shuddered, revealing glimpses of a thousand faces he'd worn. <words>221</words>

"I've been every faction, every belief, every side of every war." <words>232</words>

"And I'm cosmically bored of all of them." <words>240</words>

The taxi lurched to a stop at the Caves' entrance, where crystalline formations hummed with natural frequencies that could amplify any talent—or destroy it. <words>264</words>

Rain hammered the roof like apocalyptic drums. <words>271</words>

"Then why come?" <words>274</words>

She gripped the figurine tighter. <words>279</words>

"Because," Kaine said, stepping into the downpour, his shape flowing between forms with measured wildness, "true overthrow isn't choosing which side wins." <words>301</words>

He turned back, rain passing through his translucent edges. <words>310</words>

"It's ensuring neither does." <words>314</words>

Inside the Caves, their footsteps created cascading harmonies that made reality shiver. <words>326</words>

She raised the figurine toward the Cave's resonant heart, but Kaine's hand—now scaled, now furred, now crystalline—covered hers. <words>344</words>

"The Empire fell because it feared change," he whispered. <words>353</words>

"The talented rise because they worship it." <words>360</words>

"But cosmic balance?" <words>363</words>

He helped her lift the figurine higher, its chipped surface catching the Cave's song. <words>377</words>

"That requires something intelligently foolish—destroying the very concept of supremacy itself." <words>387</words>

The figurine shattered, releasing neither supremacy nor equality, but something unprecedented—a universe where power itself became as fluid as a shapeshifter's form, as broken and beautiful as chipped obsidian, ensuring eternal, magnificent instability. <words>420</words>
