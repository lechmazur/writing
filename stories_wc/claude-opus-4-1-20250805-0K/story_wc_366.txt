Captain Elsa Rime had delivered supplies to Beacon Point lighthouse for seventeen years, but tonight was different. [17] The lamp had flickered out three hours ago, leaving only moonlight to guide her worn skiff through the familiar rocks. [35] She clutched the latest anonymous letter, its edges soft from her nervous folding and unfolding during the journey. [53]

The letters had started arriving six months ago, each one describing the lighthouse keeper's growing terror. [69] "The lantern room whispers when no wind blows," the first had said. [81] "Shadows move against the light's rotation," read another. [89] Now this final plea: "Please come after the lamp dies. [99] I've left you a message in stones." [106]

Elsa tied her boat to the weathered dock, her practiced hands steady despite the chill running through her bones. [126] The lighthouse loomed above, its dead eye a wound in the star-scattered sky. [140] She'd always been reticent around others, preferring the company of waves and gulls, but Jonas the keeper had understood her silence. [162] They'd developed their own language over the years--he'd stack stones along the shore to tell her what supplies he needed, and she'd read them like words. [189]

The beach crunched beneath her boots as she searched for his message. [201] There, illuminated by phosphorescent foam: three cairns arranged in their secret pattern. [214] The first stack, seven stones high, meant "danger." [223] The second, four stones with a piece of blue sea glass balanced on top, translated to "remember safety." [241] The third pile had collapsed, but one stone remained standing--"protect." [252]

Elsa pocketed the sea glass, its surface worn smooth by decades of tides. [265] It felt warm against her palm, pulsing with captured moonlight. [276] She climbed the spiral stairs, each step echoing in the hollow tower. [289] The stairs seemed to breathe around her, exhaling salt and something older, colder. [303]

The lantern room door stood ajar. [309] Inside, Jonas sat motionless in the lamp operator's chair, his eyes reflecting the stars beyond the glass walls. [328] "You came," he whispered, though his lips didn't move. [338] "The letters found you." [343]

"Jonas?" [344] Elsa's voice cracked from disuse. [349]

"I wrote them all," he said, his form flickering like the lamp once had. [363] "Every keeper who's died here, we write them. [372] The lighthouse keeps us, but loneliness is worse than death." [383] His translucent hand gestured to the darkened lamp. [392] "We snuffed it out tonight--all of us together--to bring you here." [404]

The room filled with a soft luminescence as other figures materialized: generations of keepers, each one radiating that peculiar ache of isolation Elsa knew so well. [431] They'd all been watchers, protectors of ships they'd never meet, guardians feeding light into darkness. [447]

"The sea glass," Jonas continued, "holds our last memories of feeling safe. [460] Before the solitude consumed us. [465] Before we became the haunting." [470] 

Elsa understood then why she'd been chosen. [477] Her quiet nature, her ability to find comfort in silence--these weren't weaknesses but gifts. [491] She could be alone without becoming lonely. [498] She could protect both the living and the dead. [507]

"Teach me to tend the light," she said, her words steady now. [519]

Jonas smiled, the first genuine warmth she'd seen from him in years. [531] "The lamp responds to intention, not oil. [539] Think of every sailor you're guiding home. [547] Hold that feeling--that bottled safety you carry for others." [557]

Elsa placed her hand on the lamp's brass housing and thought of all her supply runs, how she'd always checked the light before heading to shore, knowing it meant someone was watching, someone cared. [591] The sea glass in her pocket grew warmer. [600]

The lamp blazed to life, its beam cutting through darkness and death alike. [613] The ghostly keepers sighed in unison, their forms growing softer, less anguished. [625] They'd found their new guardian, one who understood that protecting others sometimes meant standing alone in the light, transforming isolation into purpose. [647]

Elsa would keep their stories, their stacked-stone messages, their letters. [657] She would tend the lamp and the lost souls who needed its light--both on the sea and within the tower. [678] The lighthouse had chosen someone who could bottle not just the feeling of safety, but dispense it drop by precious drop to those drowning in darkness. [705]

As dawn approached, she began stacking stones on the gallery deck, spelling out in her silent language: "I am here. [719] You are seen. [722] You are not alone." [727]

The ghosts read her message and wept with relief, their tears falling like sea glass into the waiting ocean. [746]
