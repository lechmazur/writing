The sapped herbalist pressed her forehead against the cool glass of the observatory wall, watching the ocean's pulse with the fervent indifference of someone who had studied too much to care, yet couldn't stop caring. <words>30</words> Her afternoon naps had become ritual—not for rest, but for the peculiar clarity that came when consciousness thinned. <words>48</words> During these drowsy hours, she claimed, the tide patterns revealed themselves most honestly, unclouded by the tyranny of focused observation. <words>68</words>

She had dragged the blacksmith's bellows up the cliff path three months ago, its leather lungs now repurposed as a peculiar meditation aid. <words>91</words> Each squeeze matched the ocean's breathing, creating a rhythm that lulled her into that precious state of thoughtfully thoughtless awareness—present enough to record, absent enough to truly see. <words>119</words>

The price of perfection, she'd learned, was everything she'd once cherished about her craft. <words>133</words> The precise measurements, the careful botanical drawings, the methodical notes—all sacrificed for this new method of understanding that demanded she become empty, depleted, sapped of intention. <words>159</words> Her colleagues called it madness, this tracking of tides by the flight path of a lone goose that passed each day at varying heights. <words>183</words> But the goose, she insisted with exhausted conviction, knew something about the water's pull that no chart could capture. <words>202</words>

Today, as drowsiness beckoned, she positioned herself at the observatory's eastern curve. <words>214</words> The bellows wheezed beside her, marking time. <words>221</words> Through half-closed eyes, she watched the horizon blur into mathematical poetry. <words>232</words> The goose appeared—a dark apostrophe against the afternoon sky—flying lower than yesterday. <words>244</words> Low flight, high tide, her mind noted without thinking, the correlation as clear as it was inexplicable. <words>261</words>

She had once cherished precision, cherished her reputation as the coast's most meticulous herbalist. <words>275</words> Now she cherished this surrender, this deliberate unraveling of method into instinct. <words>287</words> The glass walls reflected her ghostly form, superimposed upon the sea—woman and water becoming one drowsy calculation. <words>304</words>

Her pencil moved across the paper without conscious direction, sketching patterns that only made sense in this liminal space between sleep and waking. <words>327</words> The bellows continued their ancient rhythm, breathing for her when she forgot how. <words>341</words> Tomorrow, when fully awake, she would study these somnambulant notes and find in them a perfection no conscious mind could achieve—tide tables drawn by dream logic, accurate beyond reason. <words>371</words>

The goose vanished beyond the cliff's edge. <words>378</words> She sank deeper into her calculated stupor, feeling the ocean's pull through the observatory's foundation, through her bones. <words>396</words> Perfection demanded this price: to know without knowing, to study by unstudying, to master the tides by becoming as thoughtlessly thoughtful as the water itself. <words>421</words> The bellows sighed, and she sighed with them, dissolving into data. <words>432</words>
