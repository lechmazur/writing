The lonesome minstrel mucked the rooftop horse stables at dawn, thirty floors above the neon-veined metropolis. <words>15</words> It was bizarrely typical how the wealthy still kept horses up here, their hooves clicking against solar panels while delivery drones buzzed past. <words>36</words> 

Amid coffee lines that formed each morning at the stable's automated kiosk, workers would bicker about everything except what mattered. <words>56</words> Today, the minstrel clutched his grandfather's rubber stamp, its image unclear from decades of use, worn smooth like memory itself. <words>76</words> The stamp had started it all—the inherited rivalries between those who read weather and those who read stars. <words>94</words>

His grandfather had been a cloud-tracker, one of the last before satellites made the profession obsolete. <words>110</words> The rival family, the Stellarcrofts, had mocked them for generations, claiming that tracking cloud patterns was primitive compared to their telescopic divinations. <words>132</words> But the old man had insisted clouds were letters from the cosmos, each formation a word in an endless conversation. <words>152</words>

"Coffee's ready," announced the kiosk's tinny voice. <words>159</words> The minstrel joined the line, watching cumulus formations drift between the towers while stable hands argued about feed prices. <words>178</words> He pressed the rubber stamp against his palm, feeling its indentations like braille. <words>191</words> Whatever image it once held—a cloud, a constellation, perhaps both—had become something new through erosion. <words>207</words>

The horses whinnied softly, their breath misting in the altitude-controlled atmosphere. <words>218</words> One mare, Mercury, always watched the sky with him. <words>228</words> She understood what the others couldn't: that reading the silent cosmos wasn't about choosing clouds or stars. <words>245</words> It was about the spaces between them, the conversations they held when no one was listening. <words>262</words>

A Stellarcroft descendant stood ahead in line, wearing their family's pretentious constellation-mapped jacket. <words>275</words> "Still playing with clouds, minstrel?" she asked, not unkindly but weighted with ancestral exhaustion. <words>289</words>

He showed her the stamp. <words>294</words> "Look closely," he said. <words>298</words> In its worn surface, neither cloud nor star remained, just the ghost of intention. <words>313</words> "Our families bickered for three generations about different ways to read the same silence." <words>327</words>

She studied it while the coffee line shuffled forward. <words>337</words> Above them, clouds gathered in patterns that looked almost like sheet music, while stars faded into morning. <words>354</words> The horses dozed, the city hummed its electric hymn, and two inheritors of a pointless rivalry shared a moment of understanding. <words>376</words>

"Maybe," she said finally, "the cosmos speaks through everything." <words>385</words> She ordered two coffees, handed him one. <words>392</words> Together they stood at the stable's edge, watching clouds write stories across a sky full of invisible stars, finding mundane enchantment in the ordinary miracle of morning. <words>419</words>

The minstrel sang softly to Mercury, who nickered approval, while the city below continued its ancient dance of rivalry and reconciliation. <words>440</words> The rubber stamp rested in his pocket, its purpose finally clear: some inheritances exist only to be transformed. <words>458</words>
