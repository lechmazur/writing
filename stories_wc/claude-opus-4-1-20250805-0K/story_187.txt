The stoic wanderer pressed the salvaged floorboard against the training ground's barrier, its mesmerizingly bland surface concealing runes that would impose entry where none was permitted. <words>20</words> For three years, she'd followed a trail of nightmares—literal wisps of terror that leaked from this place where familiars learned to harvest human dreams. <words>44</words>

"You're late," growled Master Corvaine, not turning from the blackboard where she erased the final formula with deliberate strokes. <words>63</words> The equation for binding a familiar's soul dissipated into chalk dust, lost forever unless someone had memorized it. <words>80</words>

"Traffic," the wanderer lied, though they both knew she'd been standing outside for hours, waiting for this precise moment when the lesson ended and defenses wavered. <words>106</words>

Corvaine's laugh was sharp glass wrapped in velvet. <words>114</words> "Elara, you always were terrible at deception, even when we were students here ourselves." <words>128</words>

The wanderer—Elara—stepped through the breach her enchanted floorboard created, feeling the familiar training ground's magic probe her intentions with fingers made of moonlight and malice. <words>152</words> Around them, empty cages swayed where crow-familiars had practiced enthralling mice, and scorch marks decorated walls where fire-salamanders had learned to burn selectively. <words>175</words>

"You're here to steal our methods," Corvaine stated, turning finally, her eyes reflecting the archived pain of a thousand taught cruelties. <words>196</words> "To preserve what we're ordered to destroy." <words>203</words>

"The Council demands erasure, but erasure is another form of lie," Elara replied, her stoicism cracking just enough to reveal something raw beneath. <words>226</words> "These practices—brutal as they are—they're history." <words>233</words>

"History worth preserving?" <words>236</words> Corvaine's hand hovered over a leather journal, its pages fat with pressed nightmare-wisps and familiar contracts. <words>252</words> "I trained creatures to violate minds here, Elara." <words>260</words> "I taught them to make humans love their own imprisonment." <words>270</words>

"And that's exactly why it must be archived," Elara said, moving closer with that strange brash tenderness she'd perfected—aggressive in its gentleness, soft in its insistence. <words>296</words> "Not to repeat, but to remember what we're capable of becoming." <words>307</words>

The floorboard in her hand pulsed with warmth; it had come from the cabin where the first familiar-binding occurred, where necessary lies were told to convince wild spirits that servitude meant survival. <words>339</words> She placed it on Corvaine's desk like an offering. <words>348</words>

"The Council will hunt you," Corvaine warned, but she was already sliding the journal across the table. <words>365</words>

"They'll hunt us both," Elara corrected, tucking the journal inside her coat where other archived horrors rested. <words>381</words> "Your resignation letter was quite thorough—mentioned me by name, I heard." <words>392</words>

Corvaine's smile was a knife finding its sheath. <words>400</words> "Well, if we're going to preserve monsters, we might as well be thorough about it." <words>415</words>

They left together through the breach, two archivists of atrocity, carrying their necessary lies into a world that preferred its darkness forgotten. <words>438</words> Behind them, the training ground began its scheduled collapse, burying everything except what they'd saved. <words>453</words>

The nightmares followed them out, loyal as familiars, drawn to their new masters who understood that some truths were too terrible to lose. <words>477</words>
