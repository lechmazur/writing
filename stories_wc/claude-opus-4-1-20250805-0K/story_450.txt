Marina's legs moved with perfect precision in the thought experiment chamber's sterile light, but her tongue always betrayed her sharp mind. <words>21</words> The facility required dancers to soak in monitoring baths twice daily, bubbles fizzing with neural enhancers that supposedly improved cognitive-physical synchronization. <words>41</words> She clutched the scorched mission patch from Apollo-23—the spacecraft that never officially existed—its fabric rough against her pruning fingertips. <words>60</words> Her grandmother had smuggled it out forty years ago, before the government's denial crushed everyone who remembered the truth. <words>79</words> "Is making the... the yearly photo of families," Marina muttered, her words tangling as they always did when speaking aloud. <words>99</words> The chamber's AI responded with patience reserved for children: "Family photo tradition confirmed for tomorrow, Subject Seven." <words>116</words> Marina knew the prophecy by heart, even if she couldn't speak it properly: the seventh generation would mimic the forbidden dance that opened dimensions. <words>141</words> During each bath, she practiced the movements her ancestors had hidden inside those innocent annual portraits—a raised elbow here, a tilted hip there. <words>165</words> The poses looked random to outsiders, but assembled across decades, they formed the complete sequence. <words>181</words> Tomorrow's photo would complete it. <words>186</words> She felt both desperate urgency and paralyzing reluctance, knowing the dance would prove the crashed mission had discovered something universe-shattering. <words>206</words> The weight of her family's denial pressed down—seven generations pretending they were just artists, not guardians of cosmic horror. <words>226</words> "Subject Seven, your cortisol suggests distress," the AI noted, as Marina's movements grew sharper, angrier. <words>241</words> She wanted to scream that the prophecy was backwards—they weren't meant to open anything, but seal it forever. <words>259</words> The patch belonged to her great-uncle, who'd returned from Apollo-23 speaking in equations until silence became his only language. <words>279</words> Marina understood now why dancers were chosen: bodies could hold truths that words would mangle. <words>294</words> The bathwater turned crimson with neural enhancers as she rehearsed, each gesture both invitation and warning. <words>310</words> She would fulfill the prophecy tomorrow, but not as expected—instead of opening the door those astronauts had found, she would dance it shut. <words>334</words> Her family thought their tradition preserved hope; Marina knew it preserved a necessary lie. <words>348</words> The chamber hummed with artificial certainty while she moved through steps that defied classification, neither ballet nor ritual, neither surrender nor rebellion. <words>371</words> When tomorrow's camera clicked, capturing her final pose, the sequence would complete—and the weight of denial would finally serve its purpose. <words>393</words> Some truths were too large for words, too terrible for worlds, existing only in the space between a dancer's breaths. <words>413</words> Marina sank deeper into bubbles that reflected nothing, practicing her salvation. <words>424</words>
