Mira's worn leather boots echoed through the forgotten research facility, each step stirring dust that had settled during the twenty-year interregnum between the Old Empire's fall and whatever would rise next. <words>30</words> The eager brewer clutched her salvaged fermentation notes, gleefully morose as she hummed funeral dirges while preparing to resurrect the realm's lost brewing traditions. <words>54</words> Through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades, moonlight leaked into the laboratory where she'd discovered the ancient yeast cultures, miraculously preserved in stasis chambers. <words>82</words> 

She swept broken glass from the workbench with practiced efficiency, clearing space for her equipment. <words>97</words> This facility had once engineered the Empire's ceremonial ales, the sacred brews that bound communities together through shared ritual and celebration. <words>118</words> Now, in these fractured times, villages barely spoke to one another, suspicious and isolated. <words>133</words>

"You're early tonight," she said to the stars visible through the shattered skylight. <words>146</words> She'd begun these starlit conversations months ago, when loneliness threatened to overwhelm her mission. <words>161</words> The stars were her council now, ancient witnesses to countless empire transitions. <words>173</words> "The first batch is nearly ready," she continued, checking the temperature of her improvised fermenter. <words>189</words>

Her boots had belonged to her grandfather, the last Imperial Brewmaster before the collapse. <words>203</words> He'd walked these same halls once, though back then they gleamed with purpose rather than decay. <words>220</words> She could almost see him in the shadows, his ghost-memory guiding her hands as she adjusted the fermentation vessels. <words>240</words>

The yeast cultures bubbled with impossible life, surviving decades of abandonment through the facility's automated preservation systems. <words>258</words> Each strain represented a different region's brewing tradition, a liquid genealogy of the realm's diverse peoples. <words>275</words> Mira laughed, a sound both bitter and hopeful, imagining village elders tasting their ancestral ales again. <words>291</words>

"Tomorrow, I begin distribution," she told the stars. <words>299</words> Her plan was simple: leave unmarked bottles at crossroads between settlements, let curiosity overcome suspicion. <words>314</words> The ales would carry more than flavor; they held memory, encoded in their ancient recipes. <words>330</words> Perhaps shared drinks could bridge the chasms that political collapse had carved between communities. <words>344</words>

She swept the last debris into a corner, her workspace finally ready for the morning's crucial bottling. <words>361</words> The boots creaked as she stood, leather soft with age but still sturdy, still carrying her forward. <words>378</words> Outside, the stars wheeled in their eternal dance, indifferent yet somehow encouraging. <words>390</words> Mira raised a test glass to them, tasting hope fermented from despair, sweetness drawn from ruins. <words>406</words> The realm would remember itself, one sip at a time. <words>416</words>
