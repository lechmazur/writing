Marina pirouetted across the swaying bridge between two massive banyan trunks, her bare feet finding rhythm in the metropolis's wooden heartbeat. <words>17</words> The treehouse city of Aethel sprawled through the canopy like a dream someone forgot to wake from, its platforms and walkways connecting hundreds of dwellings carved into ancient bark. <words>45</words>

She'd lost her left shoe three wishes ago—or was it four? <words>57</words> The single shoelace, still knotted around her ankle like a talisman, fluttered with each leap. <words>72</words> Marina had wished for "the power to find what's lost," but the cosmic joke was oddly predictable: she could only find things after losing something else first. <words>99</words>

"Sacred practices don't collect themselves," she sang to a passing ghost-monkey, who nodded sagely before dissolving into morning mist. <words>118</words> The spectral fauna were common here, halfway between real and imagined, much like Marina's quest itself. <words>134</words>

She needed to scour the highest temple-house before sunset, when the elders would plant the final seeds in the forgotten field below—seeds that would either restore the world's memory or erase its need to remember. <words>169</words> Marina laughed at the absurdity of it all: a dancer tasked with preserving rituals she'd never learned, guided by wishes that worked backwards. <words>193</words>

The temple-house groaned as she entered, its floors carpeted with luminescent moss that giggled when stepped upon. <words>210</words> "Third drawer, left cabinet," whispered the walls, because of course they did. <words>222</words> Everything here followed its own peculiar logic, reliably unreliable. <words>231</words>

Marina opened the drawer to find seventeen silver thimbles, each containing a different sacred practice: the art of sleeping while running, the technique of breathing underwater while dry, the method of remembering tomorrow. <words>263</words> She pocketed them all, knowing she'd lose something precious in exchange. <words>274</words>

Sure enough, her remaining shoe vanished with a apologetic poof. <words>284</words>

"Perfect," she declared, now completely barefoot except for the shoelace anklet. <words>295</words> She danced faster this way anyway, her movements becoming pure expression, unencumbered by the weight of sensible footwear or sensible anything. <words>316</words>

Below, she could see the elders gathering in the forgotten field, their robes like tired clouds against the earth. <words>335</words> Marina descended through the banyan branches, each platform a note in her vertical ballet, delivering the sacred practices just as the first seed touched soil. <words>360</words>

"You've brought them," the eldest said, neither surprised nor unsurprised—the only rational response to Marina's irrational success. <words>377</words>

"I wished badly and danced worse," Marina replied, grinning as phantom butterflies emerged from the planted seeds, "but somehow that was exactly right." <words>401</words>

The shoelace around her ankle glowed once, a small acknowledgment that embracing the absurd was, perhaps, the most sacred practice of all. <words>423</words>

As the forgotten field began remembering itself in impossible colors, Marina was already dancing away, searching for the next thing she needed to lose. <words>447</words>
