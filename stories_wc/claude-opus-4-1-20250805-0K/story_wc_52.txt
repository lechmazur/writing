The rain drummed against the skylight above Margaret's head, each drop catching the amber afternoon light before sliding away. [18] She placed the ash wood carving blank on her workbench, its pale grain waiting for her knife. [35] Three years since Thomas died in the ring, and she'd finally opened the box of his unfinished projects. [53]

The kettle began its low rumble on the hotplate in the corner of her loft studio. [69] She had perhaps four minutes before it whistled—enough time to make the first cuts. [84] The ash wood had been Thomas's last purchase, ordered the morning before the tiger turned wrong. [101] He'd planned to carve a lion's head, naturally. [109] Margaret would carve something else entirely: a clock face without hands. [120]

Her knife found the wood's heart with hauntingly practical precision. [130] Each stroke contained the years of watching Thomas work, his massive hands unexpectedly delicate with blade and chisel. [148] He'd taught her that carving was about revealing what already lived in the wood, not forcing your vision upon it. [169] "The tree remembers its shape," he'd say, sawdust in his beard. [181] "We just help it remember differently." [187]

The loft had been their shared workspace—her botanical illustrations spread across one wall, his carvings crowding the shelves. [205] Now rain beaded the glass overhead like tears that wouldn't fall, casting shifting shadows across her hands. [223] She carved the clock's outer ring, thinking of circus rings, wedding rings, the circles that contain a life. [242]

Margaret understood now what the wood wanted to become. [251] Not a monument to grief, but a meditation on presence—how love exists in crystallized time, perfect and complete even after its subject vanishes. [275] The kettle's pitch rose slightly. [280] Two minutes, maybe less. [284]

She'd spent the first year after Thomas died believing his death meant their love had been temporary, here and gone like smoke. [307] The second year taught her differently. [313] She'd found his notes in the margins of her sketches, discovered the paintings he'd bought to surprise her still wrapped in brown paper, heard his laugh in the lion's roar at the zoo. [347] Love wasn't temporary just because life was. [354] It crystallized, became artifact, fossil, evidence. [360]

The knife steadied in her grip as she carved the center where clock hands would meet. [377] This was the lesson she was harvesting from loss: that presence persists in the spaces it once filled. [395] Thomas remained in the careful way she held her tools, in her sudden understanding of wood grain, in the hauntingly practical way she now approached each day. [423] Not seeking him in shadows, but recognizing his influence in her transformed hands. [436]

The kettle's whistle began as a whisper. [443] Margaret carved faster now, not rushed but purposeful, adding the suggestion of numerals that weren't quite numbers—more like moments refusing to be ordered. [467] The ash wood released its sharp, clean scent, mixing with the steam now billowing from the kettle. [485]

She set down the knife as the whistle reached its peak, walked to silence it. [500] The rain had softened against the skylight, and late sun broke through, painting everything in rust-hued peace. [518] The clock face sat on her bench, still rough but unmistakably itself. [530] She would refine it over weeks, maybe months, but its essence had been contained in these few minutes. [549]

Pouring water over tea leaves, Margaret understood that this was how she would continue. [563] Not moving on—that phrase had always seemed false—but moving with. [574] Carrying forward what Thomas had given her, transformed but undiminished. [584] The steam rose toward the rain-beaded skylight, here and gone, but the warmth remained in her hands. [602] She returned to the bench, picked up the carving, felt its emerging shape. [615] Tomorrow she would begin teaching workshops in the loft, sharing what she'd learned about revealing what wood remembers. [633] But today, while her tea cooled, she would sit with this roughed-out clock face that would never tell time, only hold it. [656]
