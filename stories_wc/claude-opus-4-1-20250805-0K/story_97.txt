The brass compass spun wildly in Vera's palm, its needle refusing to point anywhere stable in this collapsing pocket of reality. <words>18</words> She was the Oracle of Certainties, a fact-minded prophet who'd built her reputation on irrefutable truths—until the day her heart shattered and everything changed. <words>43</words>

"North doesn't exist here," she muttered with desperately casual indifference, though her hands trembled. <words>57</words> The unstable dimension flickered around her like a dying fluorescent bulb, showing glimpses of forgotten places that existed between the folds of proper space. <words>81</words> Each heartbreak-induced vision came sharper than the last: abandoned libraries floating in void-space, empty amphitheaters where extinct civilizations once gathered, ghost-gardens blooming with memories of extinct flowers. <words>108</words>

She'd discovered this ability three weeks ago when Marcus left, his goodbye letter still crumpled in her jacket pocket. <words>127</words> The pain had torn something open inside her—not just emotionally, but dimensionally. <words>139</words> Where other oracles saw futures through meditation or ritual, Vera's visions came through the raw, unfiltered agony of loss. <words>158</words> It was almost funny, she thought with bitter optimism, that the path to empathy required first having your heart excavated. <words>178</words>

The brass compass suddenly steadied, pointing toward a shimmer in the fractured air. <words>191</words> "There," she whispered, stepping forward into what looked like crystallized tears hanging in space. <words>205</words> Time moved strangely here—entire conversations could unfold in the cradle of a whispered minute, while seconds stretched into small eternities. <words>225</words>

Beyond the shimmer lay another forgotten place: a conference room where the universe's architects once debated the necessity of suffering. <words>244</words> Empty chairs still held the impression of beings who'd decided that love required the possibility of loss. <words>261</words> Vera touched one chair and gasped as understanding flooded through her—not facts this time, but feelings. <words>277</words>

She finally understood why her prophecies had always felt hollow before. <words>288</words> Facts without empathy were just data points floating in darkness. <words>298</words> The brass compass grew warm in her hand, no longer spinning but pulsing like a heart learning to recompose itself after breaking. <words>320</words>

"I can do this," she said aloud, her voice carrying that particular shade of optimistic desperation that comes from choosing hope despite evidence to the contrary. <words>346</words> She would map these forgotten places, document these dimensions where heartbreak became doorways. <words>359</words> Maybe she couldn't get Marcus back, but she could transform her shattered certainties into something more honest—an oracle who understood that truth wasn't just about facts but about feeling them. <words>389</words>

The unstable dimension shimmered approval, and somewhere in the distance, she heard the echo of every broken heart that had ever learned to beat again. <words>414</words> Vera smiled, tucked the brass compass close, and stepped deeper into the beautiful ruins of what she'd once thought she knew. <words>436</words>
