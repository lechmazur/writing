Mira wiped down tables with practiced irreverence, her scrappy tavern-hand existence punctuated by the broken collection of seashells she kept in her apron pocket—remnants of a life before the vacuum chamber gardens claimed half the continent. <words>30</words>

The shells rattled as she moved, their fractured edges singing of inescapable callings she'd tried to ignore for seventeen years. <words>50</words>

"You're predictably unpredictable," the patron had said last night, right before the temporal anomaly struck. <words>65</words>

Now, while the sands of time flowed backward through the tavern's hourglass centerpiece, Mira found herself walking through the vacuum chamber garden's airlock, drawn by something she couldn't name. <words>93</words>

The garden existed in perpetual contradiction—lush vegetation thriving in artificial atmosphere bubbles, each dome containing ecosystems that shouldn't coexist. <words>113</words>

She followed the fossilized footprints in what had once been a riverbed, now suspended in crystallized time-gel that preserved everything while simultaneously allowing movement through it. <words>139</words>

The footprints randomized their pattern with each backward tick of time, leading her deeper into the garden's impossible geography. <words>158</words>

"Fascinating, isn't it?" asked a voice that hadn't spoken yet but would in three minutes ago. <words>175</words>

Mira turned to see herself—older, younger, sideways through time—holding intact versions of her broken shells. <words>190</words>

"The calling was never about the shells," her other self said with flippant solemnity, arranging them in patterns that defied euclidean geometry. <words>212</words>

"It was about what breaks them." <words>218</words>

The vacuum chamber garden pulsed, its artificial lungs breathing in reverse, and Mira understood that her mundane tavern life had been preparing her for this moment of cosmic bartending. <words>247</words>

She pulled out her broken shells, each fragment now glowing with bioluminescent messages from futures that were becoming pasts. <words>266</words>

The footprints beneath them began to rise, forming a spiral staircase of compressed time leading to a door that had always been there tomorrow. <words>290</words>

"Every glass I've ever filled," Mira said, matching her other self's tone of casual profundity, "was practice for pouring reality from one vessel to another." <words>315</words>

They walked up the temporal stairs together, two versions of one person fulfilling an ancient calling that started next week and ended before the universe began. <words>341</words>

At the door, her other self smiled and shattered into shell fragments that reformed as constellation maps. <words>357</words>

Mira pushed through, finding herself back in the tavern, but now she saw it truly—each table a world, each drink a possibility, each broken shell in her pocket a seed for gardens that would grow in vacuum chambers of imagination, catapulting consciousness beyond known realms into spaces where time flowed like spilled beer, backward and forward and sideways all at once. <words>420</words>

She picked up her rag and continued cleaning, predictably unpredictable, a scrappy tavern-hand whose calling was to serve drinks to gods disguised as drunks, in a universe where broken shells held more truth than whole ones ever could. <words>459</words>
