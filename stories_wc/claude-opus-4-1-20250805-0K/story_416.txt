Sir Aldric never imagined the championship's end would lead him here. <words>11</words> The scoreboard had reset to zeros, crowds dispersed, yet something pulled him toward the luminous swamp beyond the tournament grounds. <words>30</words> His armor clinked against the silence. <words>36</words> 

The swamp glowed. <words>39</words> Phosphorescent moss painted everything in ghostly green. <words>46</words> He'd heard the urban legend: a fossilized snail shell hidden here could verify whether converging destinies were real or myth. <words>66</words> Aldric collected such legends now. <words>71</words> Better than collecting tournament victories. <words>76</words>

His academically rebellious phase at knight school had taught him one thing: official histories lied. <words>91</words> Real truth lived in whispered stories. <words>97</words> The shell supposedly showed two futures meeting. <words>104</words> Perfect nonsense. <words>106</words> Perfect intrigue. <words>108</words>

"Magnificent specimen," a voice said. <words>113</words>

Aldric turned. <words>115</words> A robed figure stood at the exact shelf of swamp rock where he'd been heading. <words>130</words> They both reached. <words>133</words> Their hands collided. <words>136</words> The fossilized snail shell tumbled between them. <words>143</words>

"Mine," they said simultaneously. <words>147</words>

The stranger lowered her hood. <words>152</words> Tournament judge. <words>154</words> The one who'd disqualified him years ago for questioning combat traditions. <words>165</words> 

"Judge Vera." <words>167</words>

"Sir Aldric." <words>169</words>

They stood frozen. <words>172</words> The shell glowed between them. <words>177</words> 

"You collect legends too?" <words>181</words> Aldric's voice carried subdued amazement. <words>186</words>

"Started after I quit judging." <words>191</words> She smiled. <words>193</words> "Your rebellious questions ruined my faith in the system." <words>202</words>

"My disqualification ruined mine." <words>206</words>

They laughed. <words>208</words> Brief. <words>209</words> Electric. <words>210</words>

Together they lifted the shell. <words>215</words> Its spiral caught the swamp's luminescence, throwing patterns across their faces. <words>226</words> Inside, two separate fossilized tracks converged into one. <words>234</words>

"The legend says—" Vera began. <words>239</words>

"—two paths meeting means the holders share a destiny," Aldric finished. <words>250</words>

Silence stretched. <words>252</words> Comfortable. <words>253</words> 

"Want to verify more legends together?" <words>259</words> she asked. <words>261</words>

"Yes." <words>262</words>

They pocketed the shell jointly, neither claiming sole ownership. <words>271</words> The swamp pulsed brighter. <words>275</words> Or maybe that was just how things looked now. <words>284</words>

Aldric's straight-laced armor suddenly felt less confining. <words>291</words> Vera's formal robes seemed less severe. <words>297</words> They walked deeper into the glowing marsh, comparing notebooks full of unverified myths. <words>310</words>

"The singing bridge?" <words>313</words> he suggested. <words>315</words>

"The memory rain?" <words>318</words> she countered. <words>320</words>

"Both." <words>321</words>

Their laughter echoed against cypress trees dripping with light. <words>330</words> Two champions of different rebellions, finding their convergence in collected impossibilities. <words>341</words> The scoreboard had reset, yes. <words>346</words> But their real game was just beginning. <words>353</words>

Behind them, the shelf where they'd collided sprouted a new phosphorescent flower. <words>365</words> The swamp recognized what they hadn't yet admitted: some destinies don't converge by accident. <words>379</words> They converge because two people were brave enough to reach for the same impossible thing at the exact right moment. <words>399</words> And sometimes, that's all the verification anyone needs. <words>407</words>
