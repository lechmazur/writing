The blacksmith descended into the catacombs beneath the cathedral, his torch casting shadows against stone older than memory. <words>18</words> Years of forging had dulled his wonder, but the covenant required his uniquely natural gift—hands that shaped metal without thought, without care. <words>39</words> Between bells, when the world above held its breath, the passages below opened their secrets. <words>55</words> 

He navigated the maze-like corridors with practiced indifference, following marks only he could read. <words>69</words> In an alcove, seven objects waited on a limestone shelf: a cracked mirror, a child's tooth, a wedding band, a soldier's button, a quill, a seed pod, and wrapped around them all, a faded ribbon. <words>104</words> Each piece told part of the cathedral's buried story—plague, war, love, loss—but together they formed something else. <words>121</words> A map. <words>123</words> A key. <words>125</words> A price. <words>127</words>

The blacksmith gathered them into his leather apron, the ribbon binding them as it once bound a bride's hair three centuries past. <words>149</words> He knew this because touching it showed him glimpses: the woman rising from rubble after the old cathedral burned, laying the first stone of the new foundation with bloodied hands. <words>179</words> She'd made the first covenant. <words>184</words> Now he would seal it. <words>189</words>

Deeper he went, until the walls wept moisture and the air tasted of iron and earth. <words>205</words> The final chamber opened like a throat. <words>212</words> Here, no torches were needed—phosphorescent moss provided light that had never known the sun. <words>227</words> At the center, a pool of water so still it might have been obsidian. <words>241</words>

The blacksmith arranged the objects in the pattern the ribbon's knots prescribed. <words>253</words> When the bell above rang for evening prayer, he would have one breath's time to choose. <words>269</words> Accept the covenant and become keeper of what slept beneath, or walk away unchanged. <words>283</words>

He waited, and when the bronze voice spoke above, he opened his mouth to answer—and hawed. <words>299</words> The hesitation stretched like molten metal cooling. <words>306</words> In that pause, he felt the weight of centuries, the patience of stone, the slow certainty of roots breaking through foundations. <words>327</words> His indifference cracked. <words>330</words> Wonder, terrible and ancient, flooded in. <words>336</words>

"Yes," he whispered, and dropped the faded ribbon into the water. <words>347</words> It sank without ripples. <words>351</words> The objects dissolved into light, into memory, into promise. <words>360</words> The covenant sealed itself with neither drama nor ceremony, just a shift in the air, a settling of dust. <words>379</words> 

The blacksmith climbed back through the catacombs, emerging as the next bell rang. <words>392</words> Above, the cathedral stood unchanged. <words>397</words> Below, something vast and patient smiled in its sleep, bound now to indifferent hands that would guard it well. <words>416</words>
