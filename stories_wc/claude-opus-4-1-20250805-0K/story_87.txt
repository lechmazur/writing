The patient librarian moved through the steampunk dining hall with hyperactively serene precision, her fingers dancing across brass gear-work shelves that lined the walls where meals once clattered. <words>24</words> Steam hissed from copper pipes overhead as she reached for the wrinkled sticker sheet tucked between two ancient volumes—stars and hearts faded to ghosts of childhood promises. <words>51</words>

This had been their place, hers and Matthias's, before the academy transformed it into this monument of cogs and nostalgia. <words>71</words> Before he'd stolen her research and published it under his name. <words>83</words> Before she'd spent seventeen years planning this moment. <words>91</words>

The forgotten mixtapes sat in neat rows on her cart, each one labeled in her meticulous script. <words>108</words> She'd collected them from estate sales and dumpsters, these magnetic strips holding strangers' love songs and breakup ballads. <words>126</words> But hidden in their static was something else—fragments of the old acoustic resonance maps she'd discovered, the ones that could make a building's very bones throb with targeted frequencies. <words>155</words>

Matthias would arrive in an hour for the dedication ceremony, ready to accept another hollow victory, another accolade built on her erasure. <words>177</words> The trustees would applaud him for converting this dining hall into a "revolutionary archival space," never knowing she'd been hired as its keeper. <words>201</words> Never knowing she'd spent months encoding her own story into the building itself. <words>215</words>

With savage grace, she began placing the tapes into the players she'd hidden throughout the hall's infrastructure. <words>232</words> Each sticker from the wrinkled sheet marked a precise location—a childhood ritual repurposed into architectural revenge. <words>248</words> The stars went on load-bearing pillars, the hearts on resonance points. <words>260</words>

As she worked, memories surfaced unbidden: their late nights here as students, sharing theories over cold coffee, before ambition poisoned everything. <words>281</words> She'd loved him once, in the careless way of youth. <words>292</words> That love had curdled into something patient and deliberate. <words>301</words>

The final tape clicked into place. <words>307</words> When played simultaneously, they would generate a frequency that would make the entire structure throb—not enough to damage, but enough to unsettle, to whisper the truth through vibration and shadow. <words>339</words> Every ceremony, every celebration in Matthias's honor would pulse with her ghosted presence. <words>352</words>

In the hush of a memory reclaimed, she understood this wasn't about destroying him anymore. <words>367</words> It was about burying an old hatred beneath something more elegant—a haunting he'd never escape, a reminder encoded in brass and steam. <words>390</words> She smoothed the last wrinkled sticker onto the podium where he would stand. <words>403</words>

The hollow victory would be hers after all, echoing through every gear-click and pipe-whistle until the building itself forgot why it hummed with such beautiful, terrible restraint. <words>430</words>
