The morbid juggler, Mortis, entered the abandoned laboratory where failed experiments still bubbled in their forgotten vessels, their chemical hearts beating against glass walls like trapped moths. <words>24</words> He carried three skulls polished to mirror brightness, each one stolen from medical schools that had expelled him for what they called "consistently strange interpretations of anatomy." <words>49</words> The bent ruler in his pocket—warped from years of measuring things that shouldn't exist—scraped against his hip as he walked toward the central table where his grandmother's notes lay scattered. <words>80</words>

She had been the first to twist traditions, transforming the family's centuries-old funeral parlor into something the town council couldn't name but desperately wanted gone. <words>105</words> "Death should dance," she'd written in margins stained with formaldehyde and saffron, "and mourning should cartwheel through grief until it becomes something else entirely." <words>129</words>

Mortis began his performance, tossing the skulls in perfect arcs while reciting chemical formulas backwards, each word releasing the scent of rare spices—cardamom, black frankincense, corpse flower pollen—that his grandmother had infused into the bones during her final experiment. <words>170</words> The laboratory's abandoned centrifuge whirred to life, responding to the aromatic triggers she'd programmed decades ago. <words>187</words>

He used the bent ruler to clamp open a rusted valve, releasing pressurized laughter his grandmother had extracted from dying comedians who understood the universe's ultimate joke. <words>215</words> The laughter mixed with the spice-laden air, creating a phosphorescent fog that made the skulls glow as they spun through his consistently strange routine—figure-eights that bent spacetime, cascades that reversed entropy. <words>247</words>

Within the span of a shared smile—his own reflected in the skulls' polished surfaces, multiplied infinitely in the laboratory's cracked mirrors—Mortis felt his grandmother's presence crystallize. <words>273</words> She materialized not as ghost but as possibility, her form assembled from chemical equations and the memory of jasmine tea. <words>293</words>

"You came," she said, her voice carrying notes of zinc and starlight. <words>305</words>

"To laugh last at the cosmic punchline," Mortis replied, never breaking his juggling rhythm. <words>319</words> "The one about death being permanent, tradition being sacred, and normal being necessary." <words>332</words>

Together they stood in defiant compassion against a world that demanded bodies be still, grief be solemn, and chemistry obey its textbooks. <words>354</words> The skulls spiraled higher, pulling mercury dreams from broken thermometers, coaxing dead experiments back to impossible life. <words>371</words> 

His grandmother touched the bent ruler, straightening it with a thought, then bending it into a perfect circle. <words>390</words> "The real joke," she whispered as she began to fade, leaving only the scent of rare spices and revolutionized sorrow, "is that they think strange is the opposite of sacred." <words>420</words>

Mortis caught all three skulls simultaneously, their laughter echoing through eternity, proving that death itself could learn new tricks. <words>439</words> The laboratory sighed, finally understanding its purpose: to be the stage where tradition died laughing and was reborn dancing. <words>458</words>
