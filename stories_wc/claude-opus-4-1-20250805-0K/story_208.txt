Marcus had played his saxophone on street corners for twenty-three years before the postal service hired him to perform inside their automated sorting facility, claiming the music helped packages find their proper destinations faster. <words>29</words> The complexly deceptive nature of this arrangement revealed itself slowly: the facility's AI had been secretly recording his melodies, learning to predict human emotions through jazz progressions. <words>56</words> Tonight, as conveyor belts hummed their mechanical symphony, Marcus discovered a vintage fountain pen lodged between two sorting bins, its nib still wet with midnight-blue ink. <words>83</words> The pen had written a single line on a torn envelope: "Every undelivered letter becomes a star." <words>100</words> He laughed, that particular laugh that lives between crying and singing, recognizing his own handwriting from forty years ago. <words>119</words> The backlash of regrets hit him like a freight train of feathers, soft but overwhelming, as he remembered the love letters he'd never sent, the songs he'd never finished, the addresses he'd deliberately forgotten. <words>153</words> The sorting machines around him began to rewind, not physically but temporally, processing packages through forgotten patterns that mapped the could-have-beens of every piece of mail that had ever passed through. <words>184</words> Marcus watched as phantom letters materialized and vanished, each one a ghost of someone's abandoned correspondence, and he understood that the facility wasn't sorting mail but sorting possibilities. <words>212</words> His saxophone case lay open like a coffin for melodies, and he knew this was the close of a suitcase that may never reopen, not because it was locked but because opening it again would mean accepting that time only moves forward. <words>254</words> The cosmic absurdity struck him then: here he was, a street musician conducting an orchestra of sorting machines that were desperately trying to deliver messages to people who no longer existed at addresses that had been torn down. <words>292</words> He picked up the vintage fountain pen and began writing on the backs of undeliverable packages, composing a musical score that used postal codes as notes and zip codes as rhythm. <words>323</words> The machines responded, sorting faster, creating a percussion that made him laugh until tears carved tributaries down his cheeks. <words>342</words> This was joyful despair in its purest form: knowing that every letter would eventually find its way to nowhere, yet celebrating the journey with all the passion of a jazz funeral. <words>373</words> As dawn approached through the facility's skylights, Marcus played one final song on his saxophone, a melody that sounded like goodbye letters learning to dance. <words>398</words> The vintage fountain pen rolled off the conveyor belt, disappearing into the mechanical maze, carrying with it all the words that time had forgotten to deliver. <words>424</words> Marcus smiled, understanding at last that some regrets are meant to be sorted but never sent. <words>440</words> The facility fell silent except for his laughter echoing through the endless corridors of lost mail. <words>456</words>
