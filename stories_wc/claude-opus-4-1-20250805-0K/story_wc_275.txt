The glass dome stretched above Mira like a prayer made solid, its panels catching the afternoon sun in geometric patterns across the desert rose farm. [23] She moved between the rows with practiced silence, her fingers brushing each plant as she passed, whispering the old words her mother had taught her before the tower fell. [53] "Patience," she murmured to a struggling seedling, pressing her palm against its soil. [66] "Resilience," to another that bent but refused to break. [75]

Her father's bounty hunting had taught her to read the world differently—not for targets or threats, but for the spaces between violence where life persisted. [100] She possessed what he called a senseless perception, the ability to notice what others overlooked: the way sand shifted before a storm, how plants leaned toward kindness like sunlight. [131]

In her pocket, she carried a scrap of airship ballast sandbag, weathered canvas that had once helped her father's vessel navigate the sky routes before the tower's collapse changed everything. [163] Now it served as her seed pouch, the coarse fabric somehow perfect for the delicate work of cultivation. [181]

The desert roses responded to her method of inculcating values into their very roots. [195] She didn't merely water them; she taught them. [203] Each plant learned through her touch to grow despite the harsh world beyond the dome, to bloom not in defiance but in gentle insistence. [227]

"Engraved quiet," she called it—the practice of etching stillness into living things until they carried peace in their cells. [247] The phrase had come to her three years ago, the day after the tower fell, when ash still drifted like snow and her father arrived home with blood on his coat and hollow eyes. [280]

That was when she'd begun this work in earnest, transforming his abandoned greenhouse into something more than shelter. [298] While he hunted the architects of destruction, she cultivated its antidote. [309] The contrast might have torn them apart, but instead it held them together like the metal frame supporting the dome—opposing forces creating stability. [332]

A shadow passed overhead. [336] Her father's airship descended toward the landing pad, earlier than expected. [347] Mira didn't hurry; haste would disturb the roses' meditation. [356] She finished her round, then walked to meet him at the dome's entrance. [369]

He stood there, weapon still in hand, exhaustion carved into his weathered face. [382] "The Bennett contract," he said simply. [388] "Complete." [389]

She nodded, understanding flooding through her with that peculiar perception she'd inherited from him—seeing not just what was, but what could be. [412] Without speaking, she led him into the greenhouse. [420]

At the center row, she paused. [426] "Here," she said, gesturing to a desert rose that blazed crimson despite its tranquil bearing. [441] "This one knows your story." [446]

Her father knelt slowly, and she watched him sheathe his weapon with the deliberate care of someone learning a new language. [467] His calloused fingers touched the plant's leaves, and she saw something shift in his expression—not softness exactly, but recognition. [487]

"You're teaching them," he said. [492]

"Teaching them to weave continuity through chaos," she corrected gently. [501] "The same way these roses bloom in the desert, the same way we persist after the tower, the same way you return home despite everything." [526]

The dome held them in its quiet blaze of afternoon light, parent and child and countless roses all breathing the same recycled air, all part of the same impossible garden. [556] Her father's hand remained on the plant, and she saw him trying to give it something—perhaps an apology, perhaps a promise. [577]

"The world breaks," Mira said, pulling the sandbag scrap from her pocket and shaking seeds into her palm. [595] "We grow anyway." [598]

Together they planted the new seeds, the bounty hunter learning his daughter's patient method, understanding finally that her pacifism wasn't weakness but a different kind of strength—one that created rather than destroyed, that insisted on tomorrow even when today burned. [640]

Outside the dome, the desert waited with its harsh truths. [650] Inside, the roses continued their quiet revolution, engraving peace into the world one bloom at a time. [667]

When evening came, they sat among the plants, no longer hunter and pacifist but simply family, held together by the strange grace of growing things. [692]

The tower had fallen, but here, something else rose. [701]
