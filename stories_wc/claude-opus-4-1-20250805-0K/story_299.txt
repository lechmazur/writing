The morning church bells echoed across the chalk cliffs as Margot pinned her grandmother's amber brooch to her paint-stained smock. <words>17</words> She was the colony's unsure champion of traditional fresco techniques, having won last year's preservation award almost by accident when her experimental piece accidentally revived a forgotten medieval method. <words>45</words>

"Another funeral," chirped Elena from the doorway, her smile contradicting the somber bells. <words>59</words> "Old Henrik's, I think—he was the last who knew the proper way to mix egg tempera." <words>76</words>

Margot's fingers trembled on the brooch, its ancient resin catching the gray morning light. <words>90</words> Her grandmother had worn it while painting these same cliffs, back when the colony thrived with masters who passed down centuries of knowledge through patient apprenticeships. <words>116</words> Now only she remained, rationally rebellious in her insistence that progress didn't mean abandoning every tradition, yet perpetually doubting whether her interpretations honored or betrayed the old ways. <words>144</words>

The bells continued their cheerful dirge as she walked the interconnected paths between studios, each weathered building housing another artist who'd chosen convenience over craft. <words>169</words> Digital tablets glowed through windows where grinding stones once scattered pigments. <words>180</words> She understood their logic—why spend weeks preparing materials when suppliers delivered pre-mixed paints overnight? <words>195</words> Yet something essential vanished with each shortcut, some ineffable connection between artist and art that no amount of efficiency could replace. <words>217</words>

At Henrik's studio, she found his apprentice destroying the egg tempera samples. <words>229</words> "Health regulations," the boy shrugged, dumping decades of color experiments into plastic bags. <words>243</words> "Can't keep organic materials after—" <words>248</words>

"Stop." <words>249</words> Margot surprised herself with the authority in her voice. <words>258</words> The amber brooch seemed to warm against her chest, carrying generations of imperfect love—flawed teachers passing incomplete knowledge to imperfect students, each adding their own mistakes and discoveries to the tradition. <words>289</words> This was how culture survived, not through pristine preservation but through messy, human transmission. <words>304</words>

She gathered Henrik's samples, knowing she'd spend months deciphering his cryptic notes, probably misunderstanding half his techniques. <words>321</words> But these imperfect interpretations would underpin something new, something that honored the past while acknowledging the present. <words>338</words> The other artists watched from their doorways as she carried the boxes up the chalk path, some curious, others dismissive. <words>358</words>

The bells fell silent, but their echo lingered in the salt air. <words>370</words> Tomorrow she'd begin teaching whoever would listen, sharing Henrik's methods filtered through her own uncertain understanding. <words>387</words> It wasn't perfect preservation—nothing ever was—but it was love, rationally rebellious and beautifully flawed, keeping the old ways alive through willing imperfection. <words>410</words> The amber brooch caught the emerging sun, glowing like preserved fire. <words>421</words> She smiled sadly, knowing that someday another unsure champion would stand here, trying to remember what she had almost forgotten to teach them. <words>445</words> The chalk cliffs stood eternal, indifferent witnesses to humanity's cheerful, gloomy march toward forgetting and remembering, losing and finding, over and over again. <words>469</words>
