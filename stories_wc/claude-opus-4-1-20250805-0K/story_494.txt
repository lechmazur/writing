The arrogant swordsman knelt in the calligraphy master's courtyard, his blade across his knees, studying the faded tapestry fragment clutched in his trembling hand. <words>20</words> His sister had embroidered it before the plague took her—before it took everyone who knew the traditional song sung at every family wedding. <words>39</words>

"You must authorize the ceremony," the master said, grinding ink with deliberate slowness. <words>52</words> "Only the eldest can release our bloodline from its shackled potential." <words>63</words>

Between breaths, Takeshi saw it all: his grandfather teaching him the blade, his mother humming that sacred melody, his father's calloused hands guiding his first strokes across rice paper. <words>92</words> He'd scorned their gentle arts, choosing steel over silk, conquest over creation. <words>104</words> Now, in this empty courtyard where once a hundred voices would have risen in celebration, he alone remained. <words>122</words>

"I don't remember the words," he admitted, his famous confidence fracturing into something doubtfully confident, a warrior lost in unfamiliar territory. <words>143</words>

The master's eyes held harsh tenderness—the look of someone who must break a bone to set it properly. <words>161</words> "The words live in your blood, boy. <words>168</words> You've simply buried them beneath your pride." <words>175</words>

Takeshi traced the threadbare pattern with one finger: phoenixes rising from ash, lovers joining hands, children dancing in circles. <words>194</words> His sister had been twelve, working by candlelight to finish it for their cousin's wedding that never came. <words>212</words> The fragment smelled of smoke and sickness, of endings that arrived too soon. <words>225</words>

"I was meant to deliver a spark where all lights have gone out," he whispered, understanding finally why the master had summoned him. <words>248</words> Not for his swordsmanship, but for what he'd abandoned—the keeper's role, the voice that bridges generations. <words>264</words>

He stood, letting his sword fall away, and began to hum. <words>275</words> The melody came haltingly at first, then stronger, as if his bones themselves remembered what his mind had forgotten. <words>294</words> The master's brush moved across fresh silk, capturing each note in flowing characters. <words>307</words>

When the first verse emerged from his throat, Takeshi felt his grandmother's hands on his shoulders, his father's breath in his lungs. <words>329</words> The courtyard filled with invisible witnesses—all those who had sung before, waiting for someone to remember. <words>345</words>

"I authorize this union," he sang, though no bride or groom stood before him. <words>359</words> He sang to the empty air, to the future, to children not yet born who would need these words. <words>378</words> His voice cracked, reformed, found its truth. <words>385</words>

The master nodded, setting down his brush. <words>392</words> "Now you understand. <words>395</words> The sharpest blade cannot cut through forgetting. <words>402</words> Only memory can restore what plague has stolen." <words>410</words>

Takeshi folded the fragment carefully, placing it beside the master's finished scroll. <words>422</words> Tomorrow, he would teach others. <words>427</words> Tonight, he would sing until dawn, becoming the bridge his people needed. <words>439</words>
