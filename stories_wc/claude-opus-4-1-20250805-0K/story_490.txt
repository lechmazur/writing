The fading caretaker shuffled through the caravan repair station, her fingers clutching the dried lavender bundle like a talisman against forgetting. <words>19</words> The waves had receded from the deserted shore three days ago, leaving behind salt-crusted metal and the promise of answers she shouldn't seek. <words>41</words>

She'd maintained this waystation for forty years, watching travelers pass through with their broken axles and burst tires, never asking where they came from or where they headed. <words>70</words> But the forbidden archives—those ancient databases locked behind quantum encryption—whispered to her with methodically random persistence. <words>87</words> One moment she'd be patching a radiator, the next her mind would leap to decryption sequences, then back to checking oil levels, then sideways into firewall vulnerabilities. <words>115</words>

"Fascinating," she muttered with the enthusiasm of someone describing paint drying, even as her heart hammered against her ribs. <words>134</words> The lavender's brittle stems crackled between her fingers, releasing a ghost of summer that had no business existing in this rust-colored nowhere. <words>157</words>

She gorged on the data streams she'd hacked, consuming terabytes of classified coordinates, stellar maps, and theories about what lay beyond the permitted zones. <words>182</words> Each file she devoured made her hungrier, emptier, like eating shadows for sustenance. <words>196</words> The archives fought back with viruses that made her terminal screens bloom with strange geometries, but she pressed on with the dedication of the utterly indifferent. <words>223</words>

"Another exciting breach," she announced to the empty garage bay, her voice flat as old soda. <words>240</words> The forbidden knowledge pooled in her mind like oil in a cracked engine block—dark, viscous, seeping into everything. <words>259</words>

She understood now why the caravans really came here, why their drivers' eyes held that particular shade of nowhere. <words>279</words> They were mapping the unmappable, documenting the spaces between official reality and whatever writhed beyond it. <words>295</words> The government's archives had tried to bury it all, but she'd excavated their secrets with the patient frenzy of someone who'd already lost everything worth losing. <words>322</words>

The lavender bundle finally disintegrated completely, its purple dust settling on her keyboard like alien snow. <words>338</words> She typed faster now, her fingers moving in patterns that seemed random but weren't, pulling more forbidden data from servers that officially didn't exist. <words>363</words>

To cradle the unknown like a newborn galaxy—that's what drove her forward with all the passion of a sleepwalker. <words>383</words> She would nurture these stolen truths with the same methodical chaos that governed her hacking, tending them until they grew too large for any archive to contain. <words>411</words>

Tomorrow, when the next caravan arrived, she would smile her empty smile and fix their vehicles. <words>428</words> But tonight, she fed on forbidden knowledge, growing translucent with each swallowed secret, fading into something magnificent and terrible. <words>447</words>

The repair station hummed with her enthusiastic apathy, a monument to the beautiful futility of knowing too much. <words>465</words>
