The tired swordsman sat in the floating rock monastery's breakroom, his plain cloth bag resting against calloused feet. <words>16</words> Brother Chen had just resigned, leaving behind only silence and a half-finished cup of tea. <words>31</words> 

"You're not following him down," said the Abbot, though it wasn't a question. <words>44</words>

The swordsman shrugged with fierce apathy, the kind that comes from caring too much for too long. <words>61</words> "The meteor showers begin tonight." <words>66</words>

"Ah." <words>67</words> The Abbot's eyes crinkled with knowing naivety—that peculiar wisdom of understanding everything while choosing to believe in simpler truths. <words>86</words> "Still chasing fallen stars to overcome your past?" <words>94</words>

The swordsman had made a promise to himself years ago, hidden beneath layers of exhaustion and duty: he would find where the meteors landed. <words>118</words> Not for glory or redemption, but for the spark of defiance that still flickered somewhere beneath his weathered exterior. <words>137</words> Each shower traced a path across the sky, and he'd learned their language through decades of patient observation. <words>155</words>

"Brother Chen thought the monastery was a prison," the Abbot continued, pouring fresh tea. <words>169</words> "But you know better." <words>173</words>

The swordsman did know better. <words>178</words> The floating rock monastery wasn't anchored by chains but by choice. <words>189</words> Every monk here had overcome something by staying, not leaving. <words>199</words> Yet tonight's meteor shower would point toward the Northern Wastes, where legends said the first stars had fallen. <words>217</words>

"My sword hasn't left its sheath in three years," the swordsman said, his voice rough with disuse. <words>234</words> "But the meteors..." <words>237</words> He trailed off, unable to explain how following their paths had become his only remaining rebellion against a life of perfect discipline. <words>259</words>

The Abbot lifted the plain cloth bag, surprisingly heavy, and handed it back. <words>272</words> "Rice for the journey." <words>276</words> His knowing naivety shone through again—pretending not to notice the subtle shift in the swordsman's posture, the way exhaustion transformed into purpose. <words>299</words>

"I'll return before the new moon," the swordsman lied, and they both knew it. <words>313</words> The spark of defiance had caught fire at last, fed by Brother Chen's departure and the celestial map only he could read. <words>335</words>

Standing in the quiet breakroom, surrounded by empty cushions and abandoned teacups, the tired swordsman felt the weight of his hidden promise lifting. <words>358</words> He would follow tonight's shower to its end, overcome whatever waited there, and perhaps discover why the stars kept falling in the first place. <words>382</words>

The Abbot smiled as the swordsman left, his fierce apathy finally cracking like ice before spring. <words>398</words> Some prisons, after all, were meant to be escaped by following the light of falling stars, carrying nothing but a plain cloth bag and the knowing naivety that the journey itself was the destination. <words>432</words>
