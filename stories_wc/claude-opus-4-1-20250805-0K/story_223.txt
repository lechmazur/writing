Captain Elara Voss pressed her palm against the crystal fortress wall, fighting another wave of nausea that had plagued her since childhood—even solid ground felt like a ship's deck to her cursed senses. <words>25</words> The rainbow canyon stretched behind her, its prismatic walls catching the last light of day, marking the end of her three-hundred-year journey. <words>45</words>

She'd been awkwardly charming once, stumbling through naval ceremonies with endearing apologies for her perpetual seasickness, making admirals laugh despite themselves. <words>66</words> That was before she'd traded secrets with the Lunar Merchants, exchanging fleet positions for the knowledge that would transform her from mortal officer to something else entirely. <words>93</words>

The translucent ghost orchid bulb pulsed in her pocket, its ethereal glow synchronized with her heartbeat—or what remained of it. <words>113</words> She'd tracked moon phases for centuries, waiting for the precise alignment that would allow the bulb to bloom and grant her passage into the fortress's mirror chamber. <words>140</words> Tonight, finally, the moon hung pregnant and silver above the canyon's rim. <words>152</words>

The fortress doors recognized her altered state, parting like water. <words>162</words> Inside, corridors of living crystal hummed with memories of all who'd walked them—traders, traitors, seekers like herself. <words>179</words> Her boots clicked against floors that had witnessed the rise and fall of empires while she'd wandered, neither fully alive nor dead, sustained by the orchid's promise. <words>206</words>

The mirror waited in the fortress's heart, tall as a mast and black as the ocean depths that still haunted her dreams. <words>228</words> It had lied to her once, showing her a future where her betrayal saved the fleet, where her seasickness was cured, where she died a hero. <words>254</words> Instead, her traded secrets had led to massacre, and her transformation had trapped her between worlds, forever unsteady, forever sailing an invisible sea. <words>277</words>

She withdrew the ghost orchid bulb, watching it crack and bloom in the moon-touched air. <words>292</words> Spectral petals unfurled, each one a year of her exile made manifest. <words>304</words> The mirror's surface rippled, preparing another deception, but she'd learned its patterns across the quiet longing of centuries. <words>322</words>

"Show me the truth this time," she commanded with nostalgic defiance, remembering the young officer who'd once believed in honor. <words>342</words> "Show me if my penance has been enough." <words>350</words>

The orchid's light pierced the mirror's lies, revealing not her future but her past—every moment she might have chosen differently. <words>370</words> Her seasickness hadn't been a curse but a warning, her body's rebellion against the path that would lead her here. <words>390</words> Now, with the fortress as witness and the rainbow canyon as her confessor, Captain Elara Voss finally understood: some transformations could never be undone, only embraced with whatever grace remained. <words>419</words>

The mirror cracked, honest at last, and in its fractures, she saw herself clearly—neither hero nor villain, but something more complex, more human, despite everything. <words>444</words>

She smiled, steady for the first time in three centuries. <words>454</words>
