The sapphire viaduct stretched across the dead sea like a prayer made of stone, its azure arches catching the first light of dawn. [21] Mira stood at its center, her mediocre magic flickering like a candle in wind, holding the broken ship's bell she'd salvaged from the harbor's final vessel. [47]

Three years had passed since the last fish was caught. [57] The oceans had simply... emptied. [62] Not poisoned, not overfished—the marine life had vanished as if erased, leaving behind water so pure it reflected nothing but sky. [83] The cosmic scales had tipped, and Mira, despite her lukewarm talents, believed she understood why. [98]

"The resonance is wrong," she murmured, examining the bell's cracked bronze surface. [110] Ships' bells had rung across the waters for millennia, their frequencies creating a vast harmonic network that, she theorized, had kept the boundary between realms stable. [135] When the last bell fell silent—this very bell, from the fishing vessel Aurora—the membrane between worlds had torn. [154] The fish hadn't died; they'd slipped sideways into somewhere else. [164]

Her fellow mages at the Academy had laughed. [172] Mira's magic barely warmed tea, let alone mended cosmic rifts. [183] But she'd spent months in the abandoned maritime museum, studying the acoustics of bronze, the way sound traveled through water, the precise dripping rates of condensation inside bell chambers during fog. [214] Each drop, she'd discovered, created micro-vibrations that accumulated into something greater. [226]

She'd need to rebuild the bell's voice, not its body. [237]

The viaduct was crucial—its sapphire wasn't merely decorative but a massive tuning fork, carved by ancient engineers who understood frequencies humans had forgotten. [260] At dawn, when temperature and humidity reached perfect equilibrium, dew would form inside the bell at exactly three drops per minute. [282] This rate, combined with the viaduct's resonance, should theoretically recreate the lost harmonic. [296]

Mira suspended the broken bell from a makeshift frame, its fracture facing east toward the rising sun. [313] She'd practiced this ritual hundred times in her cramped apartment, burning through her savings, alienating friends who thought grief over her fisherman father had driven her mad. [339] But madness and revelation often wore the same face. [349]

As condensation began forming inside the bell, she pressed her palms against the viaduct's stone, channeling her modest magic into its crystalline structure. [373] The first drop fell. [377] A single, pure note rang out—not from the bell, but from the bridge itself, using the broken bronze as a conductor. [399] The second drop. [402] The frequency deepened, reaching pitches that bypassed the ears and resonated in bone. [416]

The third drop never fell. [421]

Instead, it hung suspended, quivering like mercury, as reality began to blur around them. [435] The empty sea below started to shimmer, showing glimpses of another ocean layered beneath—or beside—this one. [452] Schools of translucent fish flickered in and out of existence, their forms caught between worlds. [468]

Mira's magic, weak as it was, proved perfectly calibrated for this delicate work. [481] A stronger mage would have forced the realms together, causing catastrophic collision. [493] But her gentle touch allowed them to overlap like transparent sheets, finding their natural alignment. [509]

The bell began to sing without being struck, its broken edge creating harmonics that no intact instrument could produce. [528] The fish grew more solid with each passing moment, their silver bodies catching the dawn light as they returned to their proper reality. [552]

As the sun fully rose, breaking the temperature equilibrium, the phenomenon stabilized. [563] The fish were back—not all of them, but enough. [573] The ocean lived again. [577]

Mira collapsed against the viaduct's railing, exhausted but vindicated. [585] She'd been right about the cosmic imbalance, right about the bells, right about the dripping rates and frequencies. [603] Her earnest faith in a bizarre theory had restored what greater powers had written off as lost. [620]

The broken bell continued its soft humming, a new lighthouse for the boundary between worlds. [635] And Mira, the lukewarm mage who'd rebuilt a universe with condensation and patience, watched the first fishing boat in three years motor out from the harbor, its own bell ringing bright and true across the renewed waters. [674]

Sometimes the cosmos needed not power but precision, not force but understanding. [686] Sometimes it needed someone naive enough to believe the impossible was merely improbable, and devoted enough to prove it. [705]
