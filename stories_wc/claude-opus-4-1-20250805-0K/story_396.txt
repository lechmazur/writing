Margot had forgotten the scientist's name again, though she'd met him just hours earlier at the underground science fair where she'd been selling preserved dandelions. <words>19</words> Now, throughout the final performance of Vivaldi echoing through the champagne vault beneath Paris, she clutched the fragment of medieval stained-glass window she'd foraged from a demolition site last Tuesday. <words>48</words> 

The scientist—Jean-something?—wanted it for his research on ancient glazing techniques, but the vault's owner, hosting this peculiar concert-exhibition hybrid, had already offered triple. <words>72</words> Margot watched with the practiced indifference of someone who'd learned to love beauty without possessing it, her fingers absently tracing the glass fragment's cobalt veins. <words>97</words>

"Mademoiselle," the vault owner whispered during the violin's crescendo, his tailored sleeve brushing against her thrift-store cardigan, "surely you understand its value belongs in proper hands." <words>123</words>

She'd wandered into the science fair by accident, following the scent of wild mushrooms growing in the Metro's forgotten corners, and Jean-whatever had recognized the fragment's significance immediately. <words>151</words> He'd spoken passionately about molecular structures while she'd half-listened, distracted by edible moss on the venue's nineteenth-century walls. <words>169</words>

"It's not about money," she murmured, though her tone suggested she barely cared either way. <words>184</words> This was the cultural clash she navigated daily—her rambling existence against Paris's crystallized traditions, foraging history from dumpsters while others preserved it in climate-controlled cases. <words>209</words>

The scientist appeared at her elbow, having abandoned his position near the champagne pyramid. <words>223</words> "Please," he said, "for research, not profit." <words>230</words>

Margot smiled vaguely, having already forgotten which pocket held her apartment keys but remembering perfectly how sunlight had pierced this glass fragment seven centuries ago, blessing some forgotten congregation. <words>258</words> The performance was reaching its finale, the cellist's bow trembling with intensity that matched her own peculiar devotion. <words>276</words>

"I'll loan it," she announced suddenly, surprising herself. <words>284</words> "Six months to you"—she nodded at the scientist—"for your tests. <words>295</words> Then six months here"—gesturing to the owner—"for display. <words>304</words> But it returns to the streets with me." <words>312</words>

They both protested, but she was already drifting toward the exit, her mind cataloguing tomorrow's foraging routes. <words>329</words> The fragment would remain safe in her coat's inner pocket, where she kept all fragile wonders—seed pods, baroque buttons, stories of the discarded. <words>353</words>

"What's your name again?" she asked the scientist. <words>361</words>

"Jean-Baptiste," he sighed, charmed despite himself. <words>367</words>

She wouldn't remember it tomorrow, but she'd remember the way his eyes had widened seeing the glass, recognizing something precious in the ruins. <words>391</words> That was enough—this strange negotiation beneath tons of champagne and limestone, preserving wonder through calculated carelessness, through the disinterested passion of someone who loved too much to hold on tight. <words>422</words>
