Marcus pressed his bruised knuckles against the clay pot shard, its inscription barely visible in the dusty attic light. <words>18</words> The clockwork animals surrounding him clicked and whirred, their brass gears catching moonbeams through the cracked window. <words>34</words> He had trained for years to become a fighter, mastering every wrong technique with such dedication that his incompetence had become an art form. <words>58</words> Tonight, he would finally stand for something real. <words>66</words>

The shard's inscription read: "Truth sleeps in forgotten dreams." <words>75</words> Marcus understood now why he'd been drawn here, to this attic museum of mechanical creatures that moved without living. <words>94</words> Each clockwork beast housed a stolen dream, abducted from sleepers who'd given up believing. <words>109</words> His own dreams had been taken seventeen years ago, the night he first entered the ring and lost spectacularly. <words>128</words>

He wound the brass monkey nearest him, watching its cymbals crash in perfect, empty rhythm. <words>143</words> The fighter in him recognized the pattern—strike, retreat, strike, retreat—but the dreamer remembered something else. <words>158</words> In that space between mechanical movements, between each tinny crash, lived the moment before creation. <words>173</words> Like a sculptor's chisel hovering above virgin marble, everything possible existed in that breath before contact. <words>189</words>

Marcus had perfected the art of losing fights while appearing to try. <words>201</words> His trainer called it skillful incompetence, never understanding it was deliberate. <words>212</words> Each thrown match, each pulled punch, had been his way of protecting the lie that he wasn't good enough. <words>231</words> But the inscription knew better. <words>236</words> The forgotten dreams trapped in these clockwork shells knew better. <words>246</words>

He pressed the shard against the monkey's brass heart. <words>255</words> The mechanism shuddered, gears grinding against ancient dust. <words>263</words> From its hollow chest emerged a whisper of smoke—his own dream, seventeen years captive. <words>278</words> It smelled like leather and sweat and honesty. <words>286</words>

The other clockwork animals turned their heads toward him, recognizing a kindred prisoner. <words>299</words> Marcus understood then that his bruises weren't from fighting opponents but from fighting himself. <words>313</words> The real abduction hadn't been of his dreams but of his courage to fail authentically. <words>329</words>

As the dream smoke circled him, he felt the sculptor's chisel strike. <words>341</words> Not on marble but on the calcified deception he'd carried. <words>351</words> The first chip fell away—the belief that losing on purpose protected him from losing for real. <words>368</words> The clockwork animals applauded with their mechanical limbs, celebrating the destruction of his last self-deception. <words>383</words>

Marcus stood among the brass witnesses, bruised and finally honest. <words>393</words> He would return to the ring tomorrow, not to lose skillfully but to fight truly, standing for the simple principle that trying and failing held more honor than never trying at all. <words>424</words> The clay shard crumbled in his grip, its message delivered, its purpose complete. <words>438</words> The clockwork animals wound down into silence, their stolen dreams finally free to find their way home. <words>455</words>
