The hedge maze had grown wild since Mother's death, its walls reaching toward clouds that never quite touched the earth anymore. [20] Behind its heart lay the secret garden where Thomas first learned that belief could bend like willow branches without breaking. [39]

He held the changeling's baby tooth between thumb and forefinger, studying its pearlescent surface that caught light differently depending on the angle. [61] Three years had passed since they found the substitute body in the river—a masterwork of glamour that had fooled everyone except him. [84] Even now, standing where jasmine tangled with forgotten roses, he could almost hear Elara's laughter echoing from when she was seven and still mostly human. [110]

"You kept it," a voice said from behind the fountain. [120]

Thomas didn't startle anymore; his skepticism had evolved into something more useful—a forgiving awareness that truth wore many faces. [140] "You left it under your pillow," he replied, turning to face his sister, or what his sister had become. [159] "Even changelings deserve their coin from the tooth fairy." [168]

Elara stepped into the dappled sunlight, her features shifting subtly like water finding its level. [184] She looked seventeen now, though time moved differently for her kind. [195] "The Council says you've been practicing bone setting without their approval." [206]

"The old ways needed updating," Thomas said, pocketing the tooth. [216] His hands, once clumsy with youth, now moved with shrewdly innocent precision when he worked. [232] "Healing isn't just about putting pieces back together—it's about understanding why they broke apart." [247]

She sat on the moss-covered bench where Mother used to read them stories about children who weren't quite what they seemed. [269] "You know I didn't mean for the switch to happen." [279]

"I know." [281] And he did know, finally, after years of yearning for the sister he'd lost and learning to love the one he'd found. [304] The substitute body had been meant as mercy—giving their parents closure while the real Elara learned to navigate between worlds. [325] But mercy and cruelty often shared the same garden path. [335]

"The bones remember their original shape," Thomas said, kneeling to examine a broken bird's nest. [351] "But sometimes the break teaches them a better way to bear weight." [363] His fingers worked delicately, weaving dried grass with spider silk, creating something both familiar and unprecedented. [379]

Elara watched him work, her changeling eyes—now violet, now grey—reflecting depths that shouldn't exist in human anatomy. [398] "You're different than before," she observed. [404] "Less certain but more sure." [409]

It was true. [412] The cleft in his certainty had become a doorway rather than a wound. [425] Through it, he'd discovered that healing meant more than restoration—it meant transformation. [438] "Mother knew, didn't she?" [442] He asked what he'd never dared voice before. [450] "About what you were becoming?" [455]

"She knew enough to plant this garden where both worlds could touch," Elara replied, gesturing to the impossible blooms that flowered in every season simultaneously. [480] "She said mistakes were just stars waiting to form constellations." [490]

Thomas smiled, remembering Mother's hands guiding his as he learned to set his first broken wing. [507] She'd taught him that bones were merely architecture, but the spaces between them held the real magic. [525] "Will you stay this time?" [530]

"Can't," Elara said, but her voice carried warmth now instead of the old hollowness. [544] "But I'll visit." [547] She touched the fountain's edge where their handprints remained in the stone from a decade ago, back when everything seemed solid and permanent. [571] "You've turned this place into something new—a healing ground for creatures caught between." [584]

As twilight approached, bringing colors that belonged to neither day nor night, Thomas understood that his forgiveness had become a form of innovation. [608] He pressed the changeling tooth back into Elara's palm. [617] "For luck," he said. [621] "Or for remembering." [624]

She closed her fingers around it, and for a moment, she was purely the sister he remembered—gap-toothed and giggling, chasing fireflies that weren't really there. [649] Then she stepped back through the hedge, leaving Thomas in the garden where broken things learned to grow differently, where nostalgia and innovation intertwined like vines seeking light. [676] The bones he would set tomorrow would carry this knowledge: that certainty was overrated, but understanding—shrewd, innocent, and forgiving—could heal wounds that magic alone never could. [702]

In the secret garden, jasmine bloomed out of season, and Thomas began preparing tomorrow's tools, humming Mother's old song about children who were exactly what they seemed, even when they weren't. [735]
