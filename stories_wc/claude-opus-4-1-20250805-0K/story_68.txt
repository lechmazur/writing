Marcus adjusted his neural interface, watching the quantum reconstruction of Rome's ancient Subura marketplace flicker to life around him. <words>16</words> The digital archaeology project had hired him to recover corrupted data, but he'd discovered something else entirely—someone had deliberately erased a citizen from history. <words>43</words>

His fingers traced the virtual recreation of a broken rake handle, its surface covered in tiny Latin inscriptions that most archaeologists had dismissed as tool markings. <words>69</words> But Marcus recognized code when he saw it, even carved in wood two millennia ago. <words>84</words> Each groove formed a cipher, telling the story of Gaius the Collector, a freedman whose name had been systematically purged from every record. <words>107</words>

"Three minutes until full render," his timer announced—exactly how long his green tea needed to steep in the real world. <words>127</words> Marcus smiled at the synchronicity; he always did his best thinking during this ritual pause. <words>143</words>

The marketplace materialized completely, and there it was: a crude wooden stall with hundreds of bronze bottle caps nailed to its frame. <words>166</words> Gaius had collected these caps from amphorae across the Empire, each one a story, a trade route, a life touched. <words>187</words> The inscriptions revealed why he'd been erased—he'd adopted thirty-seven abandoned children, teaching them to read using these very caps, creating a literacy movement that threatened the patrician monopoly on education. <words>217</words>

Marcus felt that familiar tension, the confident uncertainty that came with every historical hack. <words>232</words> Should he restore what was deliberately destroyed? <words>239</words> His moral code said yes—truth deserved preservation—but he knew exposing this would shake the archaeological community's understanding of Roman social structures. <words>261</words>

The bottle caps weren't just trash; they were teaching tools, each one carefully selected for its unique merchant stamp. <words>281</words> Gaius had been rarely common—an ordinary man who'd done something extraordinary, then been erased for it. <words>297</words> The rake handle's inscriptions were his students' testimony, carved in secret after his name was condemned to damnatio memoriae. <words>317</words>

Marcus began reconstructing Gaius's data signature, weaving it back into the historical matrix. <words>330</words> The marketplace simulation shifted, suddenly populated with dozens of children learning their letters from bottle caps while a scarred man with gentle eyes guided their fingers. <words>357</words> This wasn't just recovering a name; it was resurrecting a revolution in bronze and clay. <words>373</words>

His tea was ready now, perfectly steeped. <words>380</words> Marcus lifted the cup with one hand while his other executed the final restoration command. <words>396</words> Gaius the Collector would be forgotten no more—a monster to the patricians, perhaps, but undeniably human to everyone else. <words>415</words> The bottle caps clinked in the digital wind, each one singing a name that refused to stay buried. <words>433</words> Marcus sipped his tea and smiled; some hacks were worth the consequences. <words>445</words>
