The spirited lumberjack Mara pedaled harder, her calloused hands gripping handlebars as she navigated the cobblestones toward L'Ossuaire, the ancient ossuary turned gourmet restaurant where she moonlighted as a dishwasher. <words>26</words>

Each bike ride triggered the same nightmare—axes splitting not wood but bone, the screams of trees becoming human wails. <words>45</words>

She'd found the coded letter three weeks ago, wedged beneath a Douglas fir's bark: coordinates, dates, and a warning about a future war that would begin with healers being silenced. <words>75</words>

The restaurant's owner, Chef Beaumont, had promised to teach her his grandmother's healing traditions—herbs pressed between femurs, tinctures aged in skull cavities—but Mara suspected his hidden agenda ran deeper than preserving folk medicine. <words>108</words>

She was gracefully awkward in the kitchen, her logger's strength accidentally crushing delicate garnishes while somehow executing perfect knife cuts, a contradiction that amused and unnerved the staff. <words>135</words>

"You move like you're dancing with ghosts," Beaumont had observed, watching her revamp the evening's prep station with mechanical precision. <words>155</words>

The nightmares intensified during her rides—visions of forests burning, of healing knowledge lost, of Beaumont's face morphing into something ancient and desperate. <words>178</words>

Tonight, she confronted him in the wine cellar, surrounded by tibias repurposed as bottle racks. <words>193</words>

"The letter," she said, producing it from her flannel pocket. <words>203</words>

"You're from the future, aren't you?" <words>209</words>

His harsh tenderness emerged as he nodded, tears cutting channels through flour dust on his cheeks. <words>225</words>

"Not from—sent back," he corrected. <words>230</words>

"The war destroys everything, especially the old ways of mending what's broken." <words>242</words>

"I've been searching for someone strong enough to carry both traditions—the violence and the healing." <words>257</words>

Mara understood then why her nightmares felt like memories, why her hands knew both destruction and restoration. <words>274</words>

"You've been dosing me," she said, not accusingly but with recognition. <words>285</words>

"Through the staff meals." <words>289</words>

"Reawakening what you once knew," he admitted. <words>296</words>

"In that future, you were our greatest healer-warrior, but you died before teaching others." <words>310</words>

"I came back to ensure you'd live long enough to pass it on." <words>323</words>

The ossuary-restaurant suddenly made sense—death and nourishment intertwined, bones bearing witness to their conspiracy against time. <words>339</words>

Her bike rides became training sessions, each pedal stroke a meditation on the duality within her—the lumberjack who could fell a tree or set a broken bone with equal expertise. <words>369</words>

She would learn his healing traditions not out of curiosity but necessity, understanding that her gracefully awkward nature was actually two selves learning to inhabit one body. <words>396</words>

The harsh tenderness between them grew stronger, mentor and student bound by a future they were desperately trying to revamp through reawakened nightmares that were actually memories of what must never come to pass. <words>429</words>

Mara accepted her role, knowing that hidden agendas sometimes concealed the most sacred truths. <words>443</words>

Tomorrow, she would begin learning to heal with the same hands that had always known how to destroy. <words>461</words>
