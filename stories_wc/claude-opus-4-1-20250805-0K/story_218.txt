Marcus had spent seven years designing board games alone in the forgotten clock tower, its gears frozen since 1947. <words>17</words> The mechanics of human connection had become abstract to him—reducible to dice rolls, card draws, and optimal strategies. <words>35</words>

Tonight, he descended for groceries but found himself inexplicably drawn to an improv show in the abandoned theater next door. <words>55</words> The performers conjured entire worlds from nothing, and Marcus watched from the back row, mesmerized by their fearless vulnerability. <words>74</words> During intermission, a woman with paint-stained fingers sat beside him, dropping a phantom carnival ticket that seemed to shimmer between existing and not existing. <words>99</words>

"It's metaphysically physical," she explained, noticing his stare. <words>107</words> "Only appears when someone needs to escape something inside themselves." <words>117</words>

Marcus touched the ticket, and suddenly he was both in the theater and somewhere else—a carnival midway where his personal demons took form as sideshow barkers. <words>143</words> "Step right up!" called his Isolation, wearing his father's disappointed face. <words>154</words> "Test your strength against the weight of never being enough!" <words>164</words>

The woman was there too, sketching the scene in charcoal. <words>174</words> "I'm drawing you during drawing," she said cryptically. <words>182</words> "The present moment creating itself." <words>187</words>

Marcus understood then that he'd been shadowboxing with these demons for years, fighting reflections rather than facing the real fear beneath—that belonging meant risking rejection. <words>212</words> In his tower, designing games about connection without participating in it, he'd created elaborate escape routes from his own loneliness. <words>233</words>

"The carnival only exists at near distance," the woman continued, her sketch capturing both his terror and his longing. <words>252</words> "Close enough to see, far enough to deny." <words>260</words>

Back in the theater, the improvisers had returned to stage, creating a scene about a clockmaker who'd forgotten how to tell time. <words>283</words> Marcus laughed—a sound that surprised him with its authenticity. <words>292</words> The woman smiled, tucking the now-solid ticket into his pocket. <words>302</words>

"Keep it," she said. <words>306</words> "Sometimes escape means running toward something, not away." <words>314</words>

Marcus climbed back to his tower that night, but something had shifted. <words>326</words> The next evening, he brought his newest game prototype to the improv theater. <words>339</words> The performers tried it during their warm-up, and their delight was genuine. <words>351</words> The woman was there again, drawing the players as they moved pieces across his board. <words>367</words>

"You designed a game about belonging," she observed. <words>375</words>

Marcus nodded, watching strangers become friends through his creation. <words>384</words> The phantom ticket remained in his pocket, solid now—not an escape route but a reminder that some distances are meant to be crossed. <words>408</words> The clock tower's gears remained still, but Marcus had finally learned to move forward in time. <words>425</words>

He'd discovered that the gift of belonging wasn't something you received; it was something you gave by showing up, vulnerable and real. <words>448</words>
