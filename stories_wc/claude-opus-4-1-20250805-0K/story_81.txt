The whispering advisor pressed the piece of driftwood into Kira's palm, its surface worn smooth by temporal currents that flowed differently here in the zone. <words>20</words> Outside the shimmer-barrier, the orchard fence surrendered to rust in real-time, but here, centuries collapsed into heartbeats. <words>37</words> 

"Feel the indentations," the advisor murmured, her voice oddly comforting despite the strangeness of their predicament. <words>53</words> Kira traced the faint marks—identical to those on the centuries-old coin she'd discovered yesterday, though yesterday meant nothing in a time-dilated zone where past and future braided together like smoke. <words>83</words>

The advisor had appeared when Kira first entered, seeking to understand time patterns that governed this pocket of twisted physics. <words>103</words> Military scientists had abandoned the site decades ago, leaving only their instruments and the inexplicable phenomenon: a sphere where minutes stretched like taffy while the world aged beyond recognition. <words>131</words>

"Your grandmother carved these marks," the advisor whispered. <words>139</words> "She stood where you stand now, though for her it was tomorrow." <words>151</words>

Kira's fingers trembled. <words>154</words> The rising empathy she'd felt since entering—that strange connection to every soul who'd passed through this temporal eddy—suddenly crystallized. <words>173</words> She understood now why the advisor's presence felt oddly comforting: she wasn't just a guide but an echo, a temporal shadow of everyone who'd sought answers here. <words>201</words>

"The coin," Kira breathed, pulling it from her pocket. <words>210</words> Its surface bore the same pattern, etched by someone trying to honor those lost to time's cruel arithmetic. <words>228</words> Here, love letters arrived before they were written; children grew old while their parents remained frozen in youth. <words>246</words>

The advisor smiled—or perhaps it was sadness; expressions shifted like quicksilver in the zone's uncertain light. <words>262</words> "Each mark represents a moment of understanding, a person who learned to read time's hidden language." <words>278</words>

Through the shimmer-barrier, Kira watched the orchard fence complete its decades-long dissolution in minutes. <words>292</words> The future pressed against the present like breath on glass. <words>302</words> She understood now that the driftwood wasn't merely wood but compressed time itself, each ring a year that never quite happened, each grain a possibility frozen mid-becoming. <words>330</words>

"Will I become like you?" Kira asked. <words>337</words> "A whisper for the next seeker?" <words>343</words>

The advisor's form flickered, revealing glimpses of countless faces—all those who'd stood here before, all those who would stand here hence. <words>364</words> "We honor the pattern by becoming part of it," she said. <words>375</words> "Your empathy rises because you're beginning to feel all of time at once." <words>388</words>

Kira pressed the coin's indentations against the driftwood's matching marks. <words>398</words> They aligned perfectly, creating a map of temporal currents she finally understood. <words>410</words> The zone wasn't a prison but a library, and she'd just learned to read. <words>424</words>
