The mild-tempered guard pedaled his maintenance bike through the Black Hole Resort's service corridors, where gravity bent like taffy and time dripped sideways. <words>24</words> Every shift, he followed the same stray cats that somehow materialized in the alleyways between the quantum suites, their fur shimmering with event-horizon dust. <words>48</words> Today, one tabby led him deeper than usual, past the kitchens where chefs prepared meals that aged backwards, toward the forgotten maintenance bay. <words>71</words> There, impossibly, sat a blacksmith's anvil—ancient iron in this place of chrome and void-glass—humming with a frequency that made his teeth ache. <words>94</words> The unraveling thread had begun three weeks ago when management labeled him "security hero" for stopping a guest from jumping into the black hole's maw. <words>119</words> He'd simply been doing his job, refusing their false dichotomy of hero or villain, but the praise felt like chains around his poetically bland existence. <words>144</words> The cat circled the anvil three times, then vanished, leaving only the suggestion that reality here was negotiable. <words>162</words> During his bike rides between sectors, he'd started noticing how the resort's perfect facade flickered—glimpses of rust beneath platinum, screams beneath the ambient music. <words>186</words> He began his disguise work subtly, switching his uniform for maintenance coveralls, following more cats through service tunnels that shouldn't exist in a space station. <words>211</words> Each feline guide revealed another impossibility: a garden growing without sunlight, a library of books written in languages that hurt to read, this anvil. <words>235</words> The savage bliss came when he understood—the resort wasn't built near the black hole for the view. <words>252</words> It was a prison, and every guest who checked in was slowly unraveling, their atoms singing the same frequency as that ancient anvil. <words>275</words> Management knew, had always known, selling extinction as luxury while he patrolled the halls with his mild temperament and careful blindness. <words>296</words> But the cats knew better, leading him on bike rides through impossible geometries to collect evidence—photographs that developed backwards, testimony from guests who remembered their own deaths. <words>324</words> He hammered his security badge against the anvil, watching it reshape into something neither weapon nor tool, but possibility itself. <words>344</words> The thread continued unraveling as he pedaled back through the alleyways, cats multiplying in his wake like quantum shadows, each one a witness to what the resort really sold. <words>374</words> Tomorrow, he would clock in for his shift, mild-tempered as always, but underneath his disguise, he carried the savage bliss of knowing that even in a place designed to consume reality, someone unremarkable could refuse to be consumed. <words>413</words> The anvil would remain, waiting, while he followed cats through the dark, neither hero nor villain, just a guard who chose to see. <words>437</words>
