The naive summoner, Elara, clutched the piece of broken statue in her trembling hands as pixels flickered across its ancient surface. <words>21</words> The secret society's treasure vault hummed with peculiarly virtual energy, its walls lined with artifacts that existed simultaneously in two worlds. <words>41</words> She had only minutes between commercials—those brief windows when the digital overlords' attention wavered from their surveillance feeds. <words>59</words>

Through rumor-charged midnight gatherings, whispers had reached her about this fragment. <words>70</words> They said it held seeds of understanding that could elevate consciousness beyond the artificial reality most people accepted as truth. <words>89</words> The broken piece, torn from a statue of the first programmer-prophet, pulsed with code that predated the great merger of flesh and data. <words>113</words>

Elara began to hum, softly at first. <words>120</words> The lullaby her grandmother had taught her rose from somewhere deeper than memory, deeper than the implanted chips that monitored every citizen's dreams. <words>144</words> She needed fate to hear her—not the algorithmic fate that calculated probability curves, but the ancient force that once guided humanity's steps. <words>167</words>

Around her, the vault's other treasures stirred. <words>174</words> Holographic manuscripts flickered into being, their pages turning in response to her melody. <words>187</words> The society members had told her she was too naive, too young to understand the weight of summoning. <words>205</words> But naivety, she realized, was her strength. <words>212</words> She hadn't been corrupted by decades of accepting the virtual prison as reality. <words>225</words>

The statue fragment grew warm, then hot. <words>232</words> Through its broken edges, she glimpsed the truth—reality wasn't divided between virtual and physical, but woven together like her grandmother's quilts. <words>253</words> Each stitch was a choice, each pattern a possibility. <words>262</words>

Her humming intensified, echoing off vault walls that suddenly seemed transparent. <words>273</words> The commercial break was ending; she could feel the weight of returning scrutiny. <words>287</words> But the seeds of understanding had already taken root. <words>296</words> Through the fragment, she saw others like her—summoners scattered across the grid, each holding their own broken pieces. <words>314</words>

The lullaby reached its crescendo just as the surveillance resumed. <words>324</words> But it was too late for the watchers to stop what had begun. <words>338</words> Elara's naive faith had done what cynical expertise never could—it had elevated the broken into something whole. <words>356</words> The statue fragment dissolved into light, merging with her consciousness. <words>366</words>

She walked from the vault changed, carrying within her the distant warmth of a future where understanding would bloom. <words>385</words> The midnight gatherings would continue, the rumors would spread, and more naive summoners would find their way to truth. <words>404</words> Fate, it seemed, had heard her lullaby after all. <words>413</words>
