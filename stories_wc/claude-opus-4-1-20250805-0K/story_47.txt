The soundless sanctuary had never hosted auditions before, but Margaret, the cathedral's dutiful ward, understood why the dying choreographer chose this place. <words>19</words> She clutched the worn leather glove he'd left behind—his conducting hand's companion through forty years of performances—and pressed play on the first stolen phone. <words>44</words>

"Candidate seven," rasped the cryptic voice note, "moves like they're apologizing to gravity." <words>58</words>

Margaret watched the dancer pirouette between the pews, their eagerly jaded expression betraying someone who'd been rejected too many times to hope, yet couldn't stop trying. <words>85</words> The choreographer had been recording these observations on phones he'd pickpocketed from audience members during his final performances, leaving them scattered for Margaret to find and solve like breadcrumbs of brutal honesty. <words>118</words>

"The cancer makes everyone whisper around me," another recording crackled, "but these notes are my final, fearless laugh at mortality—let them dance to my ghost's critique." <words>145</words>

Throughout auditions, she'd been playing these messages to the performers, watching them reframe the familiar movements they'd practiced into something rawer. <words>166</words> The sanctuary's absolute silence amplified every breath, every squeak of ballet shoes on stone, creating an intimacy that traditional studios couldn't match. <words>189</words>

"Candidate twelve understands," the next note wheezed with what might have been approval or mockery. <words>204</words> "They dance like they're drowning upward—graceless beauty in its purest form." <words>215</words>

The current dancer, a middle-aged woman with scarred knees, moved through the space as if excavating something precious from beneath her own skin. <words>239</words> Margaret recognized the choreography from the company's classic repertoire, but here, stripped of orchestra and spotlight, it became confession rather than performance. <words>261</words>

"You'll know the right one," the choreographer's voice grew weaker in what must have been his final recording. <words>279</words> "They won't dance for the audience or the critics or even for me—they'll dance like the silence is listening." <words>298</words>

Margaret smiled, remembering how he'd always insisted that true art happened in the spaces between what people expected to see. <words>318</words> These auditions weren't about selecting a lead dancer; they were about finding someone who understood that mortality itself could be choreographed into something defiantly beautiful. <words>343</words>

The woman finished, sweat glistening on her forehead like holy water. <words>354</words> Margaret approached, extending the worn leather glove—not as a relic, but as an invitation. <words>369</words> "He wanted someone who could solve the riddle of making death dance," she said. <words>384</words> "Someone who could find grace in the stumble, beauty in the gasp." <words>396</words>

The dancer accepted the glove with trembling fingers, understanding that she'd been chosen not despite her imperfections, but because she'd transformed them into her own savage scripture of survival. <words>426</words> In the soundless sanctuary, her breathing became the only music necessary. <words>437</words>

Margaret gathered the stolen phones, knowing the choreographer's cryptic legacy was complete—his mortality reframed as one last, fearless performance. <words>455</words>
