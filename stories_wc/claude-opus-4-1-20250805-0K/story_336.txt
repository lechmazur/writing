The weary undertaker stood before the astronomical clock, its brass gears frozen mid-revolution like the moment during the hush after a car backfires in a silent street. <words>24</words>

He had come to this ancient Persian palace reimagined—now a museum of forgotten sciences—following sun paths etched into weathered stone tablets. <words>46</words>

For forty years, Kasra had buried the dead, but tonight he sought to imprison something far more elusive: the tribal knowledge his grandmother had whispered to him as she lay dying. <words>77</words>

The clock towered above him, its face depicting constellations that modern astronomers had long dismissed as rarely practical mythology. <words>96</words>

Yet Kasra knew better. <words>100</words>

His fingers traced the zodiac wheel, remembering her words: "When darkness swallows the world whole, only those who understand the old ways can hold onto hope in the absolute dark." <words>130</words>

The palace walls, adorned with turquoise tiles and mirror work, reflected his haggard face a thousand times over. <words>148</words>

Each reflection showed a man who had seen too much death, carried too many to their final rest, yet still believed in something the world had forgotten. <words>176</words>

With placid ferocity, he began the ritual. <words>183</words>

First, he aligned the clock's hands to match the shadow patterns he'd tracked for months. <words>199</words>

Then, speaking in the dead language of the Magi, he called upon the knowledge that existed before books, before writing, when wisdom lived only in memory and breath. <words>228</words>

The clock responded. <words>231</words>

Its gears groaned to life, not measuring hours but epochs, not tracking days but the rise and fall of civilizations. <words>251</words>

As the mechanism turned, Kasra felt the weight of his profession lifting. <words>264</words>

Every soul he'd prepared for burial had taught him this: death was merely a doorway, and the tribal knowledge he now imprisoned within the clock's eternal movement would survive long after the last electric light failed. <words>301</words>

The palace seemed to breathe around him, its reimagined corridors whispering secrets in languages both dead and unborn. <words>319</words>

He understood now why his grandmother had chosen him, the undertaker, as keeper of this wisdom. <words>336</words>

Who better to safeguard the knowledge of life than one who walked daily with death? <words>352</words>

As dawn approached, following the same sun paths that had guided him here, Kasra completed the binding. <words>370</words>

The clock would run forever now, its cosmic mathematics preserving what textbooks could never capture: the bone-deep understanding that some truths transcend language itself. <words>395</words>

He left the palace as the city stirred, carrying within him the quiet triumph of a man who had found light in absolute darkness. <words>420</words>

The astronomical clock ticked on behind him, each movement a heartbeat of ancient wisdom, imprisoned yet eternal, rarely practical yet essential for those who would someday need to remember. <words>450</words>
