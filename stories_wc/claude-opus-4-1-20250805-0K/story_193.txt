The exiled prince pressed his shoulder against the abandoned customs office door as the sudden snowstorm howled outside. <words>16</words> Twenty years had passed since his father's advisors had orchestrated his banishment, yet loneliness still gnawed at him like winter frost. <words>36</words> 

Inside, dust motes danced through broken window light, illuminating rows of empty inspection tables where forgotten cargo once awaited judgment. <words>57</words> His fingers traced along the weathered wood until they found something unexpected—an antique mortar and pestle, jade-green and impossibly smooth. <words>78</words> The moment he lifted it, warmth spread through his palms, and the air itself seemed to thicken with presence. <words>97</words>

"You're early," said a voice behind him. <words>104</words>

He spun to find a woman materializing from shadow, her edges flickering like candleflame. <words>118</words> "The storm wasn't supposed to drive you here for three more days." <words>131</words>

"Who are you?" <words>134</words> His hand instinctively moved to where his sword once hung, finding only empty leather. <words>149</words>

"Someone who understands exile," she replied, gesturing to the mortar. <words>159</words> "That belonged to my grandmother, the court physician who refused to poison your mother." <words>174</words> Her form solidified as she stepped closer. <words>181</words> "She was banished too, but not before she discovered something." <words>191</words>

The prince's breath caught. <words>195</words> His mother's mysterious illness had been the catalyst—her death, his father's madness, his own casting out. <words>212</words> 

"The cure?" he whispered. <words>216</words>

"Not for disease." <words>219</words> She took the pestle from his trembling hand and began grinding nothing against nothing in the bowl. <words>236</words> "For loneliness itself." <words>239</words> With each circular motion, the room filled with others—translucent figures of fellow exiles, refugees, wanderers. <words>254</words> "We've always been here, in the spaces between kingdoms, invisible to those who belong." <words>269</words>

The prince watched in wonder as the ghostly gathering grew solid, their whispered conversations becoming laughter, their shadows gaining weight. <words>289</words> "How do I improve this?" he asked, understanding dawning. <words>299</words> "How do I make us all visible?" <words>306</words>

She handed him the mortar. <words>311</words> "You already have." <words>314</words> She pulled an iron key from her pocket. <words>322</words> "Your story—the prince who walked away from power rather than compromise his conscience—became legend among the displaced." <words>340</words> Her eyes met his. <words>344</words> "You're unintentionally iconic to every soul who chose integrity over security." <words>355</words>

As she turned the key in an invisible lock, the abandoned office transformed. <words>368</words> The walls became permeable to those who needed shelter, the empty tables filled with shared meals, the dust became golden light. <words>390</words> 

"Welcome," she said, as dozens of unseen forces—the forgotten, the banished, the lonely—finally found their cure in community. <words>408</words> "Welcome home." <words>410</words>

The prince set down the mortar and pestle, no longer needing ancient tools to see what had always surrounded him. <words>430</words> In choosing exile over corruption, he hadn't lost a kingdom—he'd found his people. <words>444</words> Outside, the storm softened into snow that fell like benediction on a new kind of palace. <words>461</words>
