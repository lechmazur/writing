The cargo hold's recycled air tasted of rust and regret, but Mira had grown fond of both. <words>15</words> She pressed the ancient phone's receiver against her ear, listening as the dial tone—that last vestige of Earth's old networks—finally stuttered into silence. <words>39</words> Twenty years she'd maintained this ritual, calling a number that would never answer, until today when even the illusion died. <words>59</words>

"Still playing with antiques?" Captain Voss's voice echoed from the doorway, though his tone held more concern than mockery. <words>78</words>

Mira smiled without turning, her fingers finding the piece of chalk she always kept in her pocket—stolen from a museum ship they'd raided years ago, when chalk was already a curiosity. <words>109</words> "Time moves differently in cargo holds," she said, beginning to draw on the metal floor. <words>124</words> "You track star charts; I track cloud paths through portholes." <words>134</words>

She'd been the ship's caretaker for longer than most pirates lived, maintaining not just the engines but the crew's fragile hopes. <words>156</words> Her particular gift was keeping people at arm's length while somehow making them feel held—warmly aloof, Voss had once called it, like a sun that gives light but never lets you land. <words>189</words>

The chalk scraped in spirals, mapping the paths of nebulae they'd passed, each one a frozen moment where she'd almost asked herself what if— <words>213</words> What if she'd stayed on Mars? <words>219</words> What if she'd answered that last call before the networks collapsed? <words>230</words> What if she hadn't learned that time was just another cargo to be stolen, hoarded, or jettisoned into the void? <words>250</words>

"The new kids keep asking about Earth," Voss said, stepping closer but stopping just outside her chalk circle. <words>268</words> "They want to know if we'll ever go back." <words>277</words>

"Tell them the truth," Mira replied, her voice carrying that gentle harshness she'd perfected—kindness wrapped in steel. <words>293</words> "Tell them Earth vanished the moment we stopped looking back." <words>303</words>

She finished her spiral, and in its center drew a small phone, its cord extending into infinity. <words>320</words> The chalk crumbled between her fingers, and she let the dust drift through the artificial gravity. <words>336</words> Each mote caught the cargo hold's amber lights, floating like moments she'd never have to question again. <words>353</words>

"Time isn't about what was or what might be," she said, standing and brushing white dust from her coveralls. <words>372</words> "It's about choosing which clouds to follow and which to let pass." <words>384</words>

Voss nodded, understanding as only another refugee from certainty could. <words>394</words> Together they watched the chalk dust settle, already beginning to vanish into the ship's recycling systems, taking with it the endless chorus of what-ifs that had haunted her since that dial tone first rang. <words>427</words> Tomorrow she'd find new rituals, new ways to measure the immeasurable, but tonight the silence felt like freedom. <words>445</words>
