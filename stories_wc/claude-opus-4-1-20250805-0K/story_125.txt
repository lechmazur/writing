Kira pressed her palm against the viewport, watching Earth's last farmland shimmer below the abandoned station like a memory about to be auctioned. <words>18</words> The misdelivered packages floated around her in the zero-g control room—twelve boxes meant for the colonial museum, now accidentally orbiting with an underachieving mage who'd failed every practical exam at the Academy. <words>51</words>

She'd come here to sulk, really. <words>57</words> The station had been her grandmother's post before the agricultural satellites made it obsolete. <words>71</words> But these packages changed everything. <words>76</words>

The first box she'd opened contained farming implements from the old surface colonies. <words>90</words> The second, holographic seeds. <words>94</words> The third made her heart stop: a doll head with blinking eyes, its porcelain face painted with constellations her grandmother had shown her as a child. <words>120</words> Not just any doll—a Navigator's Witness, used by the first mage-farmers to channel growth spells across vast distances. <words>139</words>

Kira laughed, a sound both bored and electric. <words>147</words> Here she was, surrounded by her heritage literally delivered to her doorstep by a shipping error, while those fields below waited for corporate buyers. <words>172</words>

She'd always been exceptionally usual—that's what her instructors said. <words>182</words> Not bad, not good, just precisely mediocre at everything magical. <words>192</words> But holding the doll head, she felt something shift. <words>201</words> Its eyes blinked in a pattern she recognized: her grandmother's spell-morse, teaching her to grow tomatoes in zero gravity when she was seven. <words>225</words>

The other packages contained more pieces: star charts, soil samples, even her great-aunt's grimoire of agricultural enchantments. <words>243</words> Someone at the museum would notice the error soon. <words>252</words> But Kira had maybe six hours before the farmland auction finalized, before her family's last fields became another shopping complex. <words>272</words>

She positioned the doll head at the main console, its blinking eyes reflecting in the dark screens. <words>289</words> The station's alignment with the fields below was perfect—her grandmother had designed it that way. <words>305</words> Kira began weaving the spell, not from her failed Academy training but from muscle memory of childhood summers, from stories encoded in misdelivered artifacts. <words>330</words>

This was her trap, she realized—not for enemies but for her own limitations. <words>344</words> She'd believed she was ordinary because she'd been measuring herself against the wrong standard. <words>359</words> The Academy taught combat magic, transformation, illusion. <words>366</words> But her blood sang with older songs: growth, patience, the slow magic of seeds and seasons. <words>383</words>

As she unveiled the massive agricultural enchantment, the doll's eyes blazed green. <words>395</words> Below, the farmland erupted with impossible harvests, vegetables growing at time-lapse speed, protecting themselves with abundance from any developer's bulldozer. <words>416</words>

Kira smiled, finally understanding what exceptionally usual meant: she was exactly, perfectly, extraordinarily herself. <words>430</words>
