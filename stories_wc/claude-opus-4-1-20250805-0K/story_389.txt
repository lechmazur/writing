The thin-lipped warlock descended the rusted ladder, his formally casual attire—a dinner jacket over spelunking gear—catching on corroded rungs. <words>17</words> December thirty-first had arrived, and with it, his annual pilgrimage to the forgotten library buried deep within the Copperhold Mine. <words>36</words> 

He knew, with confusing certainty, that tonight would yield what previous visits hadn't. <words>49</words> The viking ship figurehead fragment in his breast pocket thrummed against his ribs, a compass of bone and ancient oak pointing toward lost artifacts that whispered from shelves no mortal librarian had dusted in centuries. <words>84</words>

The library sprawled before him, its vaulted ceilings supported by timber beams that had once braced tons of earth against miners' ambitions. <words>106</words> Books lined walls carved from living rock, their spines bearing titles in dead languages that hurt to pronounce correctly. <words>125</words> He moved with purpose through the maze of knowledge, following the fragment's pull past sections marked "Verified Falsehoods" and "Necessary Lies." <words>147</words>

His destination lay in the restricted alcove where discredited textbooks moldered—those volumes academics had declared dangerous nonsense before their authors vanished under mysterious circumstances. <words>171</words> The warlock's thin lips curved into what might have been a smile. <words>183</words> These books contained rumored cures for conditions the modern world refused to acknowledge: soul-rot, temporal displacement, the hunger that came from knowing too much truth. <words>209</words>

He selected three volumes, their covers sticky with age and something else. <words>221</words> The fragment burned cold now, confirming his choice. <words>229</words> Opening the first, he began to optimize his ritual, cross-referencing between texts that contradicted each other in ways that somehow created perfect harmony. <words>252</words> 

Warnings had been carved into the reading desk by previous visitors: "Turn back," "The fruit rots from within," "Knowledge has teeth." <words>274</words> He ignored them all. <words>278</words> His hunger for understanding overrode caution—it always had. <words>286</words> That's why he'd traded his humanity for power in the first place, why his lips had thinned from speaking spells that eroded flesh with each syllable. <words>312</words>

As midnight approached and the year prepared to die, he gorged on passages that revealed how lost artifacts weren't lost at all, but hidden by reality itself when they became too dangerous to exist openly. <words>347</words> The figurehead fragment began to regenerate, sprouting splinters that wove themselves into the ghost of a dragon's head, its wooden eyes opening to regard him with ancient judgment. <words>376</words>

He understood now, with that same confusing certainty that had guided him here. <words>389</words> Some knowledge optimizes you for purposes you never chose. <words>398</words> Some fruits, once tasted, transform the eater into seeds for trees that should never grow. <words>413</words> The warlock smiled his thin-lipped smile and continued reading as the calendar above ground flipped its final page. <words>431</words>
