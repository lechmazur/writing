Eleanor stood behind the dusty counter of the abandoned amusement park's prize booth, her binoculars resting beside a vintage pencil box that glowed faintly under the waxing moon. <words>27</words> The curse that bound her tongue to truth had taught her patience—three years of watching fate weave its intricate tapestry through the lives of those who stumbled into her domain. <words>56</words> Tonight, a cardinal perched on the broken Ferris wheel, its red feathers catching moonlight as Marcus approached, his mind as stagnant as the algae-covered pond behind the funhouse. <words>84</words>

"You're early," she said, her voice carrying that politely vindictive tone she'd perfected, smooth as silk wrapped around a blade. <words>104</words> "The moon isn't quite right yet." <words>110</words>

Marcus scoffed, reaching for the pencil box. <words>117</words> "Just give me what I came for." <words>124</words>

"You came for transformation, though you'd never admit it," Eleanor replied, unable to lie even if she'd wanted to. <words>143</words> "This box contains pencils that write futures, but only during the new moon can they sketch without consequence." <words>162</words> She tilted her head, watching a barn owl join the cardinal. <words>173</words> "Tonight's waxing crescent means whatever you write will petrify—turn to stone—before completion." <words>186</words>

"You're insane," Marcus muttered, but his hand hesitated. <words>194</words>

"I'm cursed to honesty, actually," Eleanor said, adjusting her binoculars to track a nighthawk's descent. <words>209</words> "The woman who cursed me thought cynicism was dishonesty's cousin." <words>219</words> She smiled, remembering. <words>222</words> "She was wrong, of course—cynics see truth too clearly, which is why we disappoint everyone." <words>237</words>

The vintage pencil box hummed louder as clouds parted. <words>246</words> Marcus's fingers twitched toward it, drawn by invisible threads in fate's grand design. <words>259</words>

"Every month, someone like you arrives," Eleanor continued, her calm voice layered with years of witnessing. <words>275</words> "Desperate for change but terrified of it, seeking magic in objects instead of within." <words>289</words> She pushed the box forward slightly. <words>295</words> "Take it now, and your first stroke will freeze your hand to stone." <words>308</words> She paused, watching his face pale. <words>314</words> "Return in six days, during the new moon, and the pencils will flow like water, reshaping reality with each line." <words>334</words>

Marcus stepped back, his stagnant thoughts finally churning. <words>342</words> "Why tell me this?" <words>346</words>

"Because evolution requires discomfort," Eleanor answered, lifting her binoculars as a murmuration of starlings erupted from the haunted carousel. <words>364</words> "And someone who cannot lie makes the perfect catalyst for change." <words>375</words> She watched him struggle between desire and patience, between his old self and possibility. <words>390</words> "The birds know—they migrate with the seasons, transform with necessity." <words>400</words> Her fingers traced the booth's worn wood. <words>407</words> "You could learn from them." <words>412</words>

Marcus left empty-handed that night, but Eleanor knew he'd return, his mind finally stirring from its long slumber. <words>430</words> The pencil box dimmed as clouds reclaimed the moon, and she returned to her bird watching, content in her role as fate's truthful servant. <words>455</words> Some curses, she'd learned, were actually gifts wearing bitter masks. <words>465</words>
