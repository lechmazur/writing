The pixelated corridors of the Temple of Lost Controllers stretched endlessly before Malachar, each step producing echoing footsteps that bounced off the 8-bit walls in perfect, unnerving synchronization. <words>25</words> The jumpy necromancer clutched his glowing fishhook tighter, its lunar radiance cutting through the retro darkness like a cursor through black code. <words>45</words> He'd been tracking the High Priest Zephyx for three digital weeks now, convinced that the beloved spiritual leader was hiding something far more sinister than corrupted save files. <words>72</words>

While the old gods slumbered in their suspended animation chambers, their dreams generating the endless loops and glitches that plagued this world, Zephyx had risen to power through what everyone believed was divine providence. <words>105</words> But Malachar had discovered something typically bizarre even for this fractured reality: paint drips on a hidden protest mural behind the respawn fountain. <words>128</words> The drips weren't random—they formed a pattern, a code that revealed timestamps and coordinates pointing to secret meetings between Zephyx and the Virus Lords. <words>153</words>

His fishhook pulsed brighter as moonlight streamed through a gap in the temple's ceiling, illuminating more murals along the corridor. <words>173</words> Each painting showed protesters who had mysteriously vanished, their avatars permanently deleted from the server. <words>188</words> Malachar's hands trembled as he analyzed the paint drips more carefully, noticing how they all flowed toward a single point—the Sacred Chamber where Zephyx conducted his nightly prayers. <words>217</words>

The echoing footsteps suddenly multiplied. <words>222</words> Malachar froze, his paranoid nature sending electricity through his sprite-based nervous system. <words>234</words> But the footsteps were his own, bouncing back from a hidden mirror maze that Zephyx had installed to confuse intruders. <words>254</words> Using his necromantic abilities, Malachar summoned the ghostly data of deleted NPCs, their translucent forms revealing the true path forward. <words>274</words>

As he approached the Sacred Chamber, Malachar began to falter, overwhelmed by the clear complexity of what he was about to expose. <words>297</words> Zephyx wasn't just corrupt—he was a sleeper agent for the Virus Lords, slowly rewriting the world's base code while maintaining his facade of holiness. <words>322</words> The paint on the murals contained fragments of the original protesters' consciousness, trapped and screaming in digital pigment. <words>340</words>

With his glowing fishhook serving as both weapon and truth-revealer, Malachar burst through the chamber doors. <words>356</words> Zephyx stood before him, his polygonal face shifting between benevolent smile and glitched horror. <words>370</words> The echoing footsteps crescendoed into a digital symphony as Malachar raised the fishhook high, its moonlight exposing the viral code writhing beneath Zephyx's holy robes. <words>395</words> The old gods might slumber, but one jumpy necromancer would ensure their dreams weren't hijacked by false prophets. <words>413</words> Tonight, the revered icon would fall, pixel by corrupted pixel. <words>423</words>
