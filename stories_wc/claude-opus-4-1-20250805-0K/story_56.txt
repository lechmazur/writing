Marcus shuffled through the apple trees growing wild inside the collapsed Meridian Tower, his movements energetically lethargic—a practiced performance of casual disinterest that masked predatory attention. <words>19</words> The blank price tag dangling from his worn jacket caught sunlight filtering through shattered glass forty stories up. <words>36</words> He'd been waiting here for three hours, pretending to read the same water-damaged book about urban farming. <words>54</words>

The invisible allies he'd cultivated over years—security guards who looked away, clerks who forgot faces, systems that glitched at convenient moments—had all whispered the same thing: she would come here today. <words>86</words> The woman who could expose the truth about the tower's collapse, the one everyone pretended was an accident. <words>104</words>

His fingers trembled as he sensed her approach, that strange ability to magnetize exactly the right people at exactly the wrong time. <words>126</words> The book slipped from his deliberately loosened grip, pages fluttering like dying moths as it tumbled toward her feet. <words>145</words>

"Oh!" She bent to retrieve it, her corporate suit incongruous among the reclaimed wilderness. <words>159</words> Their eyes met—hers sharp with recognition, his carefully vacant. <words>169</words>

"You're him," she said, voice carrying gentle harshness, like gravel wrapped in silk. <words>182</words> "The swindler who's been leaving evidence at every construction site." <words>192</words>

Marcus straightened slowly, abandoning his bluffing posture. <words>199</words> "And you're the engineer who signed off on the foundation that killed thirty people." <words>213</words>

She flinched but didn't retreat. <words>218</words> Around them, apple blossoms trembled in the recycled air, nature's defiant beauty amid humanity's failure. <words>233</words>

"I have the original calculations," she whispered. <words>240</words> "The ones before they made me change them." <words>248</words>

At that instant, her frozen laptop—clutched against her chest for the past hour—finally whirred to life, its startup chime echoing through the vertical orchard. <words>272</words> The screen illuminated her face, casting shadows that revealed exhaustion beneath her composure. <words>285</words>

"My invisible allies aren't really invisible," Marcus admitted, gesturing to hidden cameras he'd installed among the branches. <words>302</words> "They're the families who lost someone." <words>308</words> He touched the blank price tag. <words>314</words> "This represents what can't be bought—truth." <words>320</words>

She handed him the laptop without hesitation. <words>327</words> "I'm tired of pretending to be strong while feeling so weak." <words>338</words> Her energetically lethargic movements mirrored his own—performers exhausted by their roles. <words>349</words>

"The meet-cute with the dropped book," she said with bitter amusement. <words>360</words> "You orchestrated it all." <words>364</words>

"Everything except your courage to come," Marcus replied. <words>372</words>

Together they stood in the ruins transformed to Eden, two broken people preparing to bare a truth no one dared to handle, while overhead, actual birds nested where executives once schemed. <words>403</words> The gentle harshness of justice was about to bloom like the apple trees around them, beautiful and merciless. <words>421</words>
