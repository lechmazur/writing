Marcus pressed his last poker chip against the rustic candle mold, a family heirloom he'd wagered in desperation. <words>15</words> The tidal power monitoring station hummed around them, its screens flickering like electronic prayers in the darkness. <words>31</words>

"Your grandmother's mold," Professor Vega whispered, her midnight lectures having drawn him here weekly, teaching probability theory through games of chance. <words>52</words> "You understand what you're offering?" <words>57</words>

Marcus nodded, though naive to the unspoken bargains that governed this place where engineers gambled more than money during their candlelit dinners. <words>79</words> They wagered memories, possibilities, fragments of futures they'd never live. <words>89</words>

The professor's laughter came out wet, tears streaming as she dealt the cards with rarely predictable patterns—sometimes clockwise, sometimes scattered like seafoam. <words>111</words> "The station docks seventeen percent of your stake," she explained, her voice cracking. <words>124</words> "Not in chips, boy. <words>128</words> In time." <words>130</words>

Around them, other players ate by candlelight, their shadows dancing against monitors displaying tide levels that seemed to pulse with heartbeats. <words>151</words> Marcus had come seeking one last spark before oblivion—his diagnosis had given him three months, maybe four. <words>168</words>

"Full house," someone sobbed joyfully, collecting winnings that sparkled like stolen years. <words>180</words>

The candle mold sat between them, its brass surface reflecting the professor's unhinged smile. <words>194</words> During her rebellious midnight lectures, she'd taught him that gambling wasn't about cards or dice, but about reading the invisible contracts written in desperate glances. <words>219</words>

"Why do you laugh while crying?" Marcus asked, pushing the mold forward. <words>231</words>

"Because I won my life back here," Vega said, shuffling with trembling hands. <words>244</words> "Twenty years ago, same diagnosis as you. <words>251</words> But the house always docks its percentage, and what I gained in time, I lost in—" <words>267</words> She gestured at her tears, at her laughter, at the madness that made her lectures legendary among the station's midnight community. <words>289</words>

Marcus understood then. <words>292</words> The tidal generators outside harvested more than ocean power; they pulled at human currents too, ebbing and flowing through games where nobody truly won. <words>316</words>

His cards were garbage, but he played them anyway. <words>325</words> The mold would make new candles for future dinners, for other naive gamblers seeking their spark. <words>341</words>

When he lost, Vega's laughter-tears intensified. <words>347</words> "The house docked your pain," she whispered. <words>354</words> "You'll live, but you'll never stop laughing at the sorrow of it all." <words>367</words>

Marcus felt it beginning already—the hysteria bubbling up as his body forgot how to die properly. <words>383</words> He laughed until he cried, cried until he laughed, understanding finally that some bargains are made in silence, and some prices are paid in joy turned inside-out. <words>411</words> The station's monitors flickered, recording another transaction in the ledger of transformed souls. <words>424</words>
