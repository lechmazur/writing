Captain Vera Nightwhisper rolled the chipped die between her fingers, studying the prisoner in her brig with grave amusement. <words>16</words> The psychic genealogist sat cross-legged, eyes closed, reading the ancestral memories embedded in the cell's metal walls. <words>32</words>

"You know why I kept you alive," Vera said, her voice carrying the weight of centuries spent plundering the void. <words>52</words>

The genealogist, Dr. Kaine Temporal, opened his eyes slowly. <words>61</words> "The diaries," he replied, proudly humble in his understanding. <words>70</words> "The ones left on the abandoned bullet trains of Old Earth, now orbiting as space debris." <words>86</words>

Vera tossed both dice—one perfect, one chipped—watching them tumble across the floor. <words>99</words> "My great-grandmother wrote in those diaries about a puzzle of destiny," she continued. <words>113</words> "About how certain bloodlines could lengthen their perception of time itself, stretching moments into eternities." <words>128</words>

Kaine nodded, his psychic abilities already tracing Vera's lineage through the ship's DNA signatures. <words>142</words> "You're dying," he stated simply. <words>147</words> "When the last star fades into morning light—the prophecy your ancestors wrote about—your heart will stop." <words>164</words>

"Unless?" <words>165</words> Vera's playful tone barely masked her desperation. <words>172</words>

"Unless you understand why your bloodline carries this curse," Kaine said, standing despite his shackles. <words>187</words> "The alarm bells of heartbreak that echo through your genetic memory—they're not warnings." <words>201</words> He paused, sensing her ancestors' pain. <words>207</words> "They're a countdown." <words>210</words>

Vera picked up the dice, noting how the chipped one always landed on six. <words>224</words> "My grandmother's diary mentioned that detail," she murmured. <words>232</words> "A game of chance that wasn't chance at all." <words>242</words>

"The puzzle of destiny isn't about predetermination," Kaine explained, his gift revealing layer upon layer of her family's choices. <words>261</words> "It's about understanding that every pirate in your line chose love over longevity." <words>274</words> He gestured to the walls around them. <words>281</words> "This ship has witnessed seven generations of your family choosing dangerous lovers, knowing it would shorten their lives." <words>299</words>

"But I chose no one," Vera protested, her facade cracking. <words>309</words>

"Exactly," Kaine whispered. <words>311</words> "You chose piracy over passion, trying to hush those alarm bells." <words>322</words> He touched the cell door, reading its memories. <words>330</words> "But the curse inverts for those who refuse love—time doesn't stretch; it contracts." <words>344</words>

Outside, the universe's last star began its fade into an impossible morning light. <words>358</words> Vera unlocked his cell with shaking hands. <words>365</words> "Can you lengthen my remaining moments?" <words>371</words>

Kaine picked up the chipped die, revealing a hidden seventh face—hope. <words>382</words> "Only if you're willing to read your grandmother's last diary," he said gently. <words>395</words> "The one she hid aboard this very ship." <words>403</words>

Vera's laugh carried tears. <words>407</words> "Where?" <words>408</words>

"Where all pirates hide their hearts," Kaine smiled sadly. <words>417</words> "Behind the treasure." <words>420</words>
