Marcus Chen worked as a social media exorcist, erasing digital ghosts from the feeds of those desperate enough to pay. <words>19</words> The abandoned mess hall served as his office, its peeling walls echoing with the memory of ten thousand forgotten meals. <words>38</words> Tonight, after the final chord had faded in the abandoned music hall next door, he sat studying an old grocery receipt left by his newest client. <words>64</words> 

The receipt was quietly loud in its ordinariness—milk, bread, cigarettes—but the timestamp matched the exact moment the client's sister had posted her final Instagram story before vanishing. <words>91</words> Marcus understood familiar strangers better than most; he'd spent years making people into them, severing their digital connections until they passed each other on streets without recognition. <words>118</words> His work wasn't deletion but transformation, turning viral personalities into whispers, influencers into echoes. <words>132</words>

To find this particular ghost, he would need to infiltrate the secret clubs in the alleyways behind Chinatown, where the digitally dead gathered to trade usernames like contraband. <words>160</words> Marcus approached his task with indifferent enthusiasm, the practiced nonchalance of someone who'd seen too many tearful reunions and bitter confrontations to care which way this one would go. <words>189</words> He pocketed the receipt and left the mess hall, its fluorescent lights stuttering like dying stars. <words>205</words>

The first club rejected him immediately—his digital footprint was too clean, too professional. <words>218</words> The second one, hidden behind a noodle shop's dumpster, let him in after he showed them his collection of deleted profiles, each one a trophy of his craft. <words>247</words> Inside, faces glowed blue from burner phones, everyone scrolling through feeds they no longer belonged to. <words>263</words>

That's when he saw her—the client's sister, alive and deliberately disappeared. <words>274</words> She recognized the receipt in his hand before he could speak, her eyes widening with something between fear and relief. <words>294</words> "I hired you," she said quietly, "to erase me completely, but my sister won't let go." <words>310</words>

Marcus understood then that his job wasn't to find her but to reignite the connection she'd tried to sever. <words>329</words> The grocery receipt had been her breadcrumb, left deliberately for someone who would understand the weight of chosen invisibility. <words>348</words> He handed it back to her, watching as she crushed it in her palm. <words>362</words>

"Some ghosts," Marcus said, feeding his curiosity with life's raw edge, "refuse exorcism because they're not dead—they're just learning how to haunt differently." <words>385</words> She nodded, returning to her phone, scrolling through the life she'd abandoned with the quiet loudness of someone who'd found power in disappearing. <words>409</words> Marcus left her there among the familiar strangers, understanding that sometimes the best exorcism is letting the ghost choose its own haunting. <words>431</words>
