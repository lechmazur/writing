Marina's amber earrings caught the light from the sky reflection pool as she leaned over its mercury surface, watching cloud trails from different centuries drift across the liquid mirror. <words>24</words> The pool, installed after the invention of time travel, showed not just the present sky but fragments of every sky that had ever been. <words>47</words> As a heartbreak counselor who specialized in temporal romantic disasters, she'd seen clients lose lovers to different decades, different versions of themselves. <words>69</words> But Marina herself had become something more dangerous—a femme fatale of the chronosphere, breaking hearts across timelines to understand the gravity of desires that pulled people through time itself. <words>98</words>

She was restlessly curious about one particular phenomenon: why did people always return to their greatest heartbreak? <words>115</words> The amber earrings, inherited from her grandmother who'd died before Marina was born yet somehow visited her last Tuesday, hummed with temporal energy. <words>139</words> Marina would zip between moments, tracking cloud trails that lovers left as they searched through time for their perfect moment, that instant before everything went wrong. <words>166</words>

Today's client floated in the pool's reflection, a man trapped between 1987 and 2045, loving two versions of the same woman. <words>188</words> "You're chasing an illusion," Marina told him, her voice carrying that cautious impulsiveness she'd perfected—reckless truth delivered with surgical precision. <words>209</words> "The gravity of desires pulls you backward and forward, but never to now." <words>222</words>

She touched her amber earrings, feeling their warmth. <words>230</words> Each heartbreak she counseled, each timeline she disrupted, added another layer to her own cage of illusions. <words>247</words> Marina had fallen in love with the concept of falling in love, had broken her own heart across so many timelines that she existed everywhere and nowhere. <words>274</words>

The man in the pool asked, "How do you bear it?" <words>285</words>

Marina smiled, the kind of smile that had destroyed emperors in timelines that no longer existed. <words>301</words> "I proclaim myself free," she said, watching a cloud trail from next Thursday spiral through the reflection. <words>318</words> "Free while standing in this cage of illusions I've built from every love story I've ever touched." <words>336</words>

She helped him zip back to his anchor point, that Tuesday in 1987 when he first saw her. <words>354</words> But Marina remained at the pool, restlessly curious, tracking cloud trails of desires that would never be satisfied. <words>372</words> The amber earrings pulsed with each heartbeat across time, reminding her that even femme fatales who counsel the heartbroken must eventually confront the gravity of their own desires. <words>400</words> Tomorrow, she would help another temporal romantic disaster. <words>408</words> Tonight, she watched every sky that had ever been, proclaiming herself free in her beautiful, terrible cage. <words>425</words>
