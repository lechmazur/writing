Marcus, an edgy tradesman with calloused hands and sharper tongue, pressed the torn corner of a flyer against the bioluminescent wall of the giant mushroom house. <words>26</words> The scrap showed half a date—synchronized watches at midnight—but the rest had dissolved into his pocket's dampness weeks ago. <words>45</words> Outside, the forgotten windmill groaned through its final rotation, its shadow crawling across the mushroom's gill-windows like a dying clock hand. <words>67</words> He remembered everything wrong, and that was comfortingly pessimistic; at least distorted memories couldn't disappoint you twice. <words>84</words>

The mushroom's interior pulsed with spore-light, casting everything in that blurry vividness of dreams half-remembered. <words>99</words> Marcus had come here to vectorize the path—to transform his meandering journey into something with direction, magnitude, purpose. <words>117</words> His wristwatch ticked in perfect synchronization with five others he'd hidden throughout the fungal chambers, each marking a point where reality had bent. <words>140</words>

"The candle," he muttered, lighting the wick with practiced indifference. <words>150</words> This was his real work: carrying flame through the void that memory became when you stopped trusting it. <words>168</words> The mushroom house had grown around an absence, a hole in the world where something important had been forgotten. <words>187</words> Every tradesman knew you couldn't patch emptiness with timber or stone. <words>198</words> You needed light to define the darkness first. <words>206</words>

The synchronized watches chimed midnight in cascading sequence, each tone arriving precisely one second after the last, vectorizing time itself into a navigable stream. <words>230</words> Marcus followed their sound deeper into the mushroom's chambers, where walls breathed with ancient moisture and floor became ceiling without warning. <words>251</words> The torn flyer corner in his pocket was all that remained of his original instructions, but instructions were just another memory to distort. <words>274</words>

The windmill's final rotation ended with a wooden sigh that shook spores from the ceiling. <words>289</words> Marcus's candle flickered but held, its light revealing doorways that hadn't existed moments before—or had they always been there? <words>309</words> Memory was the ultimate unreliable narrator, editing itself with each retelling. <words>320</words>

In the mushroom's deepest chamber, where synchronized watches converged their ticking into a single heartbeat, Marcus found what he'd been hired to find: nothing. <words>345</words> A perfect void, patient and eternal. <words>351</words> His employers would be disappointed, but Marcus smiled his comfortingly pessimistic smile. <words>363</words> The absence was the answer. <words>368</words> The distortion was the truth. <words>373</words>

He held his candle high, vectorizing its light into the darkness, transforming undefined dread into measurable emptiness. <words>390</words> The mushroom house sighed around him, finally able to rest now that someone had witnessed its hollow heart without trying to fill it. <words>413</words> Marcus extinguished the candle with calloused fingers, letting darkness reclaim its sovereignty. <words>425</words> Some voids, he knew, were meant to remain endless. <words>434</words>
