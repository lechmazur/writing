The minstrel sat dismayed in the black velvet sky-lounge, his lute silent beside him as the endless city sparkled below. <words>20</words> His broken watch band dangled from his wrist—time meant nothing here anyway. <words>33</words> 

He spread the old Polaroid photographs across the obsidian table. <words>44</words> Each image showed fragments of the sky-lounge's previous locations, captured during what the management called "amid garden secrets"—that peculiar hour when the floating establishment drifted between districts, revealing the city's hidden rooftop gardens. <words>78</words> The minstrel's task seemed subjectively rational only to him: excavate patterns from these frozen moments to draw a map of an endless night. <words>101</words>

"Boundaries," he muttered, tracing the photographs' edges. <words>108</words> The city below had no end, but surely it had boundaries—drawn boundaries between neighborhoods, between classes, between the possible and impossible. <words>130</words> The sky-lounge floated above them all, yet remained trapped within invisible limits of its own. <words>146</words>

He studied a Polaroid showing the lounge hovering near the Meridian Tower. <words>158</words> Another captured it above the Smoke Districts. <words>165</words> A third revealed it suspended between the Glass Gardens and the Iron Works. <words>178</words> Each photograph held clues—shadows that shouldn't exist, reflections of stars in windows that faced away from the sky, patterns in the city lights that repeated impossibly. <words>206</words>

The minstrel began to excavate meaning from these anomalies. <words>215</words> His fingers, trained for strings, now traced routes across the photographs. <words>226</words> The broken watch band caught on a photo's edge, tearing it slightly. <words>238</words> Through the tear, he glimpsed something extraordinary. <words>245</words>

The photographs weren't just images—they were layers. <words>252</words> Peeling them apart revealed the true map beneath: the endless night wasn't endless at all. <words>267</words> It was a circle, a serpent eating its tail, with the sky-lounge as its only fixed point. <words>284</words> The city below shifted and rearranged itself each time the lounge completed its circuit. <words>298</words>

"Well then," the minstrel said with quiet triumph. <words>306</words> He picked up his lute and played three precise notes. <words>316</words> The sky-lounge shuddered, acknowledging his discovery. <words>322</words> He had found the drawn boundaries of infinity itself—not walls or edges, but patterns, repetitions, the music of urban mathematics. <words>342</words>

The management would want this knowledge suppressed. <words>349</words> The other passengers preferred their illusion of endless possibility. <words>358</words> But the minstrel, no longer dismayed, had excavated truth from mere photographs. <words>370</words> He would sing of circles masquerading as lines, of boundaries that defined freedom rather than restricting it. <words>387</words> His broken watch band swung gently, keeping time to a rhythm only he understood. <words>401</words> The map of the endless night was complete. <words>409</words> Tomorrow, he would begin drawing the map of endless day. <words>419</words>
