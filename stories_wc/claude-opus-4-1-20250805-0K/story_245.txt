The smuggler's boots hammered against the rusted flight deck as she jogged, each footfall echoing through the abandoned spaceport like accusations. <words>18</words> Twenty years running contraband through these terminals, and now Mara found herself searching for waterfalls that supposedly existed behind maintenance panels—waterfalls her dead partner swore he'd discovered before the authorities shot him down. <words>51</words>

Her heart staged its daily revolt, that abstractly physical sensation where grief became a tangible weight pressing against her ribs while simultaneously feeling hollow as vacuum. <words>77</words> She'd tried everything to quiet it: meditation, drugs, even legitimate work. <words>88</words> Nothing helped except this ritual. <words>93</words>

Mara slowed near the control tower, pulling out her thermos and the single chopstick—Kenji's last gift, snapped in half during his arrest, the other piece buried with him. <words>122</words> She poured green tea onto the deck's grimy surface, watching it pool and spread. <words>136</words> The leaves settled into patterns she'd learned to read, a skill Kenji taught her during long hauls between systems. <words>155</words>

"Show me where you hid them," she muttered, stirring the puddle with the chopstick. <words>169</words> The leaves swirled, forming what looked like a schematic—ventilation shaft, third level, behind the quarantine seals. <words>185</words>

She jogged there, her breathing ragged not from exertion but from rage that never quite subsided. <words>201</words> The authorities had called Kenji a terrorist for smuggling water to drought colonies. <words>214</words> They'd executed him publicly, made an example. <words>221</words> But he'd hidden something here first—his own form of revolt. <words>232</words>

The panel came away easily, revealing exactly what the tea leaves had shown: a cascade of recycled water falling through bio-luminescent filters, creating an impossible garden in the station's bones. <words>262</words> Kenji had built this during their last run together, knowing he'd be caught, knowing she'd need something beautiful to memorialize what they'd been. <words>286</words>

She touched the chopstick to the water, watching ripples distort her reflection. <words>298</words> "You magnificent bastard," she said with biting sincerity, the words both curse and prayer. <words>313</words> The waterfalls weren't just hidden; they were a map. <words>323</words> Each cascade pointed to another, a network threading through abandoned stations across the sector. <words>337</words> Places where water flowed free, where the authorities couldn't monetize survival. <words>348</words>

Her heart's revolt quieted, transforming into something else—purpose. <words>356</words> She'd document each one, share their locations with the drought colonies through encrypted channels only smugglers knew. <words>373</words> The chopstick went back into her pocket, a compass pointing toward revolution. <words>385</words>

Mara resumed jogging, following the tea-leaf patterns that appeared in puddles throughout the station, each one revealing another piece of Kenji's hidden legacy. <words>409</words> The abandoned spaceport wasn't dead after all; it was waiting to bloom. <words>421</words>
