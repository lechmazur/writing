Marlo hadn't slept for three nights, but her brush never trembled as she painted another grinning face onto canvas in her arboreal workshop suspended among giant mushrooms. <words>22</words> The portraits lined every wall, hundreds of beaming expressions that hid what she'd seen by scrying in puddles after midnight—visions of the academy's true nature. <words>47</words> 

Her workspace was peacefully chaotic, paint tubes sprouting like flowers from bark-covered shelves while brushes dangled from mycelium threads that glowed faintly blue. <words>71</words> She dipped her smallest brush into vermillion, adding the final touches to smile number three-hundred-twelve, each one a ward against the thing that hunted her. <words>97</words>

The tapered wizard's hat with a bullet hole hung from a mushroom cap overhead, her grandfather's last gift before the academy silenced him. <words>121</words> He'd discovered their secret too—how they would devour students' dreams during the hush of an empty classroom at first light, leaving only hollow vessels behind. <words>147</words> The hat swayed gently, and she could almost hear his laughter, that frolicsome regret in his voice when he'd taught her to paint protective smiles. <words>173</words>

"Behind the painted smiles lies salvation," he'd whispered, blood seeping through his robes. <words>186</words> "Make enough, and even nightmares starve." <words>192</words>

Through her workshop's membrane windows, she watched the academy's spires pierce the pre-dawn darkness below. <words>208</words> Soon, the thing would arrive for its morning feast, sliding through empty halls where students once learned real magic instead of illusions. <words>231</words> But Marlo had transformed her grandfather's technique, each painted smile now containing a fragment of genuine joy she'd collected from memories—first snowfalls, unexpected laughter, the taste of wild honey. <words>261</words>

A wet sound echoed from the ladder below. <words>269</words> It was climbing. <words>272</words>

She grabbed another canvas, painting faster now, her exhausted mind dancing between panic and giddiness. <words>288</words> Smile three-hundred-thirteen bloomed under her brush—a child's gap-toothed grin. <words>298</words> Three-hundred-fourteen—a grandmother's knowing smirk. <words>303</words> The workshop shuddered as something massive pulled itself through the entrance. <words>314</words>

The creature paused, surrounded by hundreds of painted smiles radiating authentic happiness it couldn't digest. <words>329</words> It writhed, trying to devour the joy but choking on sincerity it couldn't corrupt. <words>344</words> Marlo laughed—tired, triumphant, touched by grief—and kept painting as the thing began to shrivel. <words>359</words>

"Just one more smile," she murmured, adding the final stroke to portrait three-hundred-fifteen as dawn light caught the bullet hole in her grandfather's hat, casting a small, perfect circle of gold across her canvas. <words>395</words> The creature's hunger turned inward, consuming itself in the presence of so much protected happiness. <words>410</words>

She'd outlasted the final obstacle, though victory tasted bittersweet as mushroom spores drifted through her workshop like snow. <words>428</words> Setting down her brush, Marlo finally closed her eyes, surrounded by the smiles that had saved her, each one a small rebellion against the darkness that had taken so much. <words>459</words>
