The surly watchman of the sailor's graveyard stood among the weathered headstones, his serenely frantic movements betraying years of practice. <words>17</words> Between seasons, when autumn's death hadn't yet yielded to winter's sleep, the cemetery revealed its secrets. <words>33</words> Old Grimwald had taught him the traditional craft forty years ago: reading the cosmic patterns through knot-work divination, each loop and twist reflecting the universe's hidden order. <words>60</words>

He pulled a short piece of yarn from his pocket, red as sunset, worn soft from countless readings. <words>78</words> The graves around him bore the names of merchants and traders who'd died at sea, their market wisdom buried with their bones. <words>100</words> But Grimwald had shown him how their restless spirits still whispered through the wind, speaking in riddles of supply and demand, of tides both literal and economic. <words>128</words>

"When does a sailor's debt become a fortune?" <words>136</words> The watchman muttered the riddle aloud, his fingers working the yarn into intricate patterns. <words>151</words> The answer came not in words but in the configuration of knots: when death transforms loss into legend, when absence creates value. <words>173</words>

His hands moved with dignified chaos, simultaneously controlled and wild, as if conducting an invisible orchestra of the dead. <words>192</words> Each knot represented a constellation, each twist a market trend observed by those who'd navigated both seas and commerce. <words>212</words> The yarn grew shorter with each pattern, but its wisdom expanded exponentially. <words>224</words>

A crow landed on Captain Morrison's headstone, cawing three times. <words>234</words> The watchman understood: three ships would arrive before the season turned, their cargo predetermined by patterns set in motion decades ago. <words>255</words> He'd seen it in the yarn's configuration, in the way it naturally fell when released, gravity and chance conspiring to reveal truth. <words>278</words>

The cemetery's iron gates creaked in the wind, playing their own riddling song. <words>291</words> Visitors thought him mad, this gruff guardian who spoke to stones and twisted string. <words>305</words> They didn't understand that market wisdom lived here among the dead merchants, that cosmic patterns repeated endlessly through boom and bust, through life and death. <words>331</words>

As November fog rolled in from the harbor, the watchman completed his final knot. <words>345</words> The yarn now held the shape of infinity, a merchant's truth: everything that rises must fall, everything that falls must rise. <words>366</words> He tucked it back into his pocket, knowing tomorrow he'd unravel it all and begin again. <words>383</words> Between seasons, between worlds, between the living market and the dead, he stood sentinel, translating the universe's riddles into lengths of twisted fiber, maintaining his serenely frantic vigil over souls who'd sailed beyond all earthly ports. <words>421</words>
