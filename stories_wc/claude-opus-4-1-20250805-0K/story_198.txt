The fervent caretaker had tended the rustic spinning wheel for seventeen years, never questioning why its threads shimmered with impossible colors. <words>21</words> Each morning on the floating island cloud gazing platform, she would polish its ancient wood while clouds drifted beneath her feet like forgotten dreams. <words>45</words> But today, something was different—the wheel's spindle pointed not downward but sideways, casting shadows that defied the sun's position. <words>64</words>

She had been oddly faithful to her duties, even when the wheel would mangle her fingers with splinters that bled starlight instead of blood. <words>88</words> The other caretakers had fled long ago, unable to bear the platform's whispered promises of home—a home that existed in another dimension entirely. <words>111</words> She alone remained, driven by fragile ferocity, determined to understand why this wheel held her captive between worlds. <words>129</words>

By following sun trails—those golden threads the wheel spun at dawn—she had discovered the platform's secret passages. <words>146</words> Each trail led to a different staircase, spiraling down through clouds that weren't clouds at all, but membranes between realities. <words>166</words> For years, she'd descended countless steps, always returning before nightfall, afraid of what lurked in the spaces between breaths and heartbeats. <words>187</words>

This morning's trail was different, pulsing with urgency. <words>195</words> She followed it to a staircase she'd never seen, its steps worn smooth by countless feet that might have been her own in other timelines. <words>220</words> Down she went, the spinning wheel's hum growing louder with each step, until she stood at the final step down the worn flight of stairs. <words>245</words>

There, she saw it—her reflection, but wrong. <words>252</words> Another her stood below, tending an identical wheel, fingers bleeding the same starlight, eyes holding the same desperate hope. <words>270</words> The truth unmasked itself with brutal clarity: she wasn't the caretaker but the prisoner, and the wheel didn't spin thread but reality itself. <words>293</words> Every revolution had created another version of her, trapped in another parallel platform, each believing they were the original. <words>311</words>

To escape this parallel dimension meant breaking the wheel, but doing so would mangle not just wood and wire but the very fabric holding infinite versions of herself in place. <words>341</words> With fragile ferocity, she grasped the spindle, feeling every other self do the same across dimensions. <words>357</words> The sun trails converged, burning bright as truth itself. <words>366</words> She pulled, and the wheel shattered—not into pieces but into possibilities. <words>377</words> Each fragment became a door, each door a choice, and she stepped through the only one that led to a world where spinning wheels were just tools, not prisons. <words>406</words> Behind her, the floating platform dissolved into morning mist, taking with it seventeen years of oddly faithful service to a lie she'd finally unmasked. <words>430</words>
