Elara descended into the underground city of the goblins, her fountain pen with its broken nib clutched against her chest. <words>18</words> The meek necromancer had never ventured so deep beneath the earth, where playground sounds echoed through crystal caverns—goblin children shrieking with joy as they swung from stalactite to stalactite. <words>47</words> She came seeking answers to the universal riddle that haunted her dreams: why do the dead whisper of a tangled tapestry? <words>68</words>

The goblin elder waited in the phosphorescent garden, his eyes peculiarly sincere as dewdrops gathered on underground ferns. <words>86</words> "You seek to understand death's pattern," he said simply. <words>95</words> "But first, you must regain what you've lost." <words>103</words>

Elara's voice trembled. <words>106</words> "I've lost nothing." <words>109</words>

"Haven't you?" <words>111</words> He pointed to her broken pen. <words>117</words> "That belonged to your mentor before the accident." <words>125</words>

She nodded, remembering how she'd pressed too hard while transcribing the final spell, snapping the golden nib. <words>142</words> Her mentor had died that same night, taking the riddle's answer with him. <words>155</words>

The elder led her deeper, past goblin mothers pushing moss-covered swings, their children's laughter bouncing off cavern walls. <words>173</words> They reached an ancient chamber where bioluminescent threads hung like a tapestry from the ceiling, each strand connected to another, tangled beyond comprehension. <words>197</words>

"The universal riddle isn't meant to be decoded," the elder whispered. <words>208</words> "It's meant to be felt." <words>213</words>

He held a single dewdrop up to the glowing threads. <words>223</words> Through the way light reflected off the dewdrop, Elara saw it all—every thread was a life, every tangle a connection. <words>243</words> Death didn't sever these threads; it merely changed their color from silver to gold. <words>257</words>

Her broken pen began to write on its own, scratching words into the air with invisible ink that only she could see. <words>279</words> The tangled tapestry wasn't chaos—it was every soul that ever lived, playing together in an eternal playground. <words>296</words>

"To understand death," she said with newfound clarity, "I must first understand life's connections." <words>310</words>

The elder smiled. <words>313</words> "Now you've regained your purpose." <words>318</words>

As Elara climbed back toward the surface, the playground sounds followed her—not just from goblin children, but from every spirit her necromancy had ever touched. <words>343</words> They weren't trapped or tormented. <words>348</words> They were playing in death's garden, waiting for their threads to weave new patterns. <words>362</words>

Her broken pen would never write normally again, but it could now trace the connections between worlds. <words>379</words> The meek necromancer had found her answer not through power or force, but through a dewdrop's simple reflection—the mystic simplicity of seeing that death and life were merely different colors in the same infinite tapestry. <words>414</words>
