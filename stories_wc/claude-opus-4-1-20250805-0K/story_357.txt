Margot pressed the black rose deeper into her journal, its dried petals crackling like whispered secrets. <words>14</words> She'd collected it three winters ago, when she first decided that solitude wasn't a curse but a crown. <words>31</words>

"Your move," rumbled Thorgrim, the frost giant whose lair had become her unlikely sanctuary. <words>45</words> The crystalline cavern glittered around them, their weekly board game of Conquest casting dancing shadows on walls of eternal ice. <words>65</words> Margot studied the board with the same intensity she once reserved for rare specimens—beetles that sang, stones that wept, things seldom odd enough to matter. <words>90</words>

"You know," she said, moving her knight with theatrical precision, "despair tried to eat me alive last Tuesday." <words>108</words> She spoke of her old predator with the earnest flippancy of someone discussing weather. <words>122</words> "Showed up right when I was cataloging my collection of abandoned wedding rings." <words>135</words>

Thorgrim's laughter shook icicles loose. <words>140</words> "And yet here you sit, undevoured." <words>146</words>

"Here I sit," she agreed, watching him contemplate his next move. <words>157</words> Round after round, they'd played this game, and round after round, she'd learned to unravel the knots despair had tied in her chest. <words>180</words> The frost giant understood—he too had chosen isolation over the exhausting performance of belonging. <words>194</words>

"I received something peculiar yesterday," Thorgrim said, producing an envelope that looked comically small in his massive fingers. <words>212</words> "A sudden invitation to the Autumn Equinox party at the Crystal Palace." <words>224</words> He slid it across the board. <words>230</words> "Addressed to both of us." <words>235</words>

Margot's focused collector's eye caught every detail—the gold leaf, the formal script, the assumption that she'd want to attend. <words>254</words> "How wonderfully presumptuous," she said, using her queen to capture his bishop. <words>266</words> "They think we're lonely." <words>270</words>

"Aren't we?" <words>272</words> Thorgrim's question held no judgment, only curiosity. <words>278</words>

She touched the journal beside her, feeling the black rose's impression through the leather. <words>292</words> "There's a difference between alone and lonely, my friend." <words>301</words> She'd spent years collecting proof of this distinction—each treasure in her collection a small triumph over the alpha predator that had once convinced her she was prey. <words>328</words> "Despair feeds on lonely. <words>332</words> It starves on alone-by-choice." <words>336</words>

The giant moved his king into check. <words>343</words> "So we decline?" <words>346</words>

Margot studied the board, then smiled with genuine mischief. <words>355</words> "Oh no, we absolutely go." <words>360</words> She moved her rook decisively. <words>365</words> "Checkmate, by the way." <words>369</words> She stood, brushing ice crystals from her coat. <words>377</words> "We go, we bring my collection of poisonous butterflies, we leave after exactly one hour, and we return here to laugh about it over tea." <words>402</words>

Thorgrim reset the board, his smile revealing teeth like stalactites. <words>412</words> "To triumph through chosen solitude, then." <words>418</words>

"To the collectors of quiet victories," Margot agreed, already planning which seldom odd treasures would most beautifully disturb the party's perfect symmetry. <words>440</words>
