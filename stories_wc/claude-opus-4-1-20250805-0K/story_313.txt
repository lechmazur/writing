Marcus pressed the empty tape dispenser against his temple, feeling its plastic coldness against his skin. <words>14</words> The dystopian farm stretched before him—rows of synthetic corn that never grew, automated scarecrows that watched everything. <words>31</words> He'd come here to hide after his last con went sideways, selling fake water purification tablets to desperate settlers. <words>50</words>

Now, during the mandatory evening story time broadcast from the rusted speakers, he sat alone in the abandoned farmhouse. <words>69</words> The government's monotone voice droned through another tale of obedience and productivity. <words>81</words> But Marcus heard something else—whispers threading between the propaganda. <words>90</words>

"You sold them hope in a bottle," a translucent figure materialized beside him. <words>103</words> The ghost of Mrs. Chen, one of his marks who'd died from contaminated water. <words>118</words> "My children buried me with your worthless tablets." <words>126</words>

Marcus gripped the tape dispenser tighter—his last possession, empty like his promises. <words>138</words> "I know what I did," he said, his voice carrying mild fervor. <words>151</words> "But I'm still here, aren't I?" <words>158</words> To taunt the jaws of defeat and grin—that was his creed. <words>170</words>

More spirits gathered, victims of his petty schemes. <words>178</words> The farmer who'd traded his last seeds for Marcus's fake government passes. <words>190</words> The widow who'd given her ration cards for his counterfeit medicine. <words>201</words>

"Why?" they asked in unison. <words>206</words>

Marcus stood, facing them with an unusually normal calmness. <words>215</words> "Because I'm a survivor," he said. <words>222</words> "In this world, we're all ghosts anyway—you're just more honest about it." <words>235</words>

The story time broadcast crackled: "Citizens who confess their crimes receive comfort in rehabilitation." <words>249</words>

He laughed bitterly. <words>252</words> The lull of remorse had been creeping through him for weeks, a slow poison worse than any he'd sold. <words>272</words> These apparitions weren't haunting him—he was interrogating them, desperate to understand if his choices mattered when everyone was doomed anyway. <words>293</words>

"Was it worth it?" he asked Mrs. Chen's ghost. <words>303</words> "Your hope, even false—wasn't it better than despair?" <words>312</words>

She flickered, considering. <words>315</words> "My children still believe the tablets worked," she whispered. <words>324</words> "They think I died peacefully." <words>329</words>

The empty tape dispenser fell from his hands, clattering on the warped floorboards. <words>342</words> Perhaps his cons had been a twisted comfort after all, small mercies in a merciless world. <words>359</words> The ghosts began to fade as the story time ended. <words>369</words>

"Wait," Marcus called out, but they were gone. <words>377</words> He was alone again with his remorse, neither fully guilty nor innocent. <words>389</words> Tomorrow, he'd leave the farm and return to the settlements. <words>399</words> Not to con anyone, but not to confess either. <words>408</words> He'd exist in that space between, unusually normal in his abnormality, grinning at defeat while it gnawed at his heels. <words>428</words>
