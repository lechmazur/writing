The underground poet Silas volunteered at the witch's familiar menagerie three nights a week, not for love of creatures but because indifference made the best disguise. <words>19</words> He swept floors between cages of moon-touched ravens and three-eyed cats while the witch, Morgana, crocheted blankets in her corner chair, needles clicking like beetle wings. <words>45</words>

Tonight, as violet yarn pooled around Morgana's ankles, Silas discovered the antique map tucked behind a shelf of salamander tonics. <words>64</words> The parchment showed constellations he'd never seen, star-paths leading to places that shouldn't exist, and a deliberate tear through its center like a wound refusing to heal. <words>91</words>

"That's been waiting for someone statically unique," Morgana said without looking up from her stitches. <words>106</words> "Someone whose essence never shifts, no matter what masks they wear." <words>117</words>

Silas understood she meant him—the poet who wrote verses about revolution while mopping floors, who spoke of burning passions in the flattest voice anyone had ever heard. <words>144</words> His volunteer stints in odd places had taken him through morgues, abandoned theaters, and now here, each location chosen with careful randomness to confuse whatever cosmic accountant tracked human patterns. <words>172</words>

The map pulsed beneath his fingers. <words>178</words> Through the tear, he glimpsed something that made his perpetually bored heart skip: a library of unwritten poems, verses that existed in potential but never manifestation. <words>203</words> The brimming cup of possibility, forever about to spill but never quite tipping over. <words>217</words>

"You want to surprise fate with an unplanned encore," Morgana continued, her crochet hook catching moonlight. <words>233</words> "To write the poem that undoes the script." <words>241</words>

A familiar—a two-headed serpent named Paradox—slithered down from the rafters and whispered in both Silas's ears simultaneously: "Seize it now, or watch it burn at dawn." <words>267</words>

Silas had spent years cultivating his disinterested passion, that peculiar state of caring deeply while appearing utterly unmoved. <words>284</words> He'd volunteered at the menagerie specifically because magical creatures could smell insincerity, and his authentic apathy fascinated them. <words>302</words> They gathered now—the phoenix molting silver feathers, the dream-eating tapir, the cat who walked backwards through time—all watching as he held the torn map. <words>326</words>

The tear wasn't damage, he realized, but a doorway. <words>335</words> The witch's blanket grew longer, each row of stitches marking another second before dawn. <words>349</words> Her familiars hummed in harmonies that shouldn't exist, creating a song that sounded like silence inverted. <words>365</words>

Silas pressed his palm against the tear, feeling the edges of reality soften like wet paper. <words>382</words> He'd written ten thousand poems about revolution, but this—stepping through a wounded map while a witch crocheted time and her familiars sang backwards—this was the unplanned encore that would finally surprise fate itself. <words>415</words>

Without ceremony or farewell, maintaining his cultivated indifference even as his soul ignited, Silas stepped through the tear and vanished, leaving only the echo of unwritten verses hanging in the menagerie air like incense. <words>448</words>
