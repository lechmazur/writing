The streetwise orphan Kira had survived fourteen winters by reading patterns in the city's chaos, but the lost orchard temple defied everything she knew. <words>19</words> Stone archways drowned beneath fruit-laden vines that bloomed and withered in theoretically random cycles, following no season she could name. <words>39</words> She'd come seeking shelter, but found instead a cursed cameo brooch half-buried in rotting pears, its ivory face carved with features that seemed to shift when she wasn't looking directly at them. <words>72</words>

The moment her fingers touched the cold silver, she heard it—a distant echo of laughter that might have been her own, or might belong to someone she'd never become. <words>102</words> Time moved strangely here, across an unwritten calendar where yesterday's moss grew over tomorrow's footprints. <words>117</words> The temple walls showed her story through reversed patterns: murals depicting her death before her birth, her triumphs preceding her failures, each image bleeding backwards into meaning. <words>145</words>

"You're early," said a voice that was also late, belonging to a monk whose robes were simultaneously new and ancient. <words>166</words> "Or perhaps perfectly timed." <words>170</words>

Kira pocketed the brooch with practiced nonchalance, though her heart hammered with confident uncertainty. <words>184</words> "I don't steal from temples," she lied, already knowing she'd keep it. <words>197</words>

"Stealing suggests ownership," the monk replied, plucking a fruit that was both ripe and rotten. <words>213</words> "That brooch has chosen many bearers, each hearing their own distant echo calling them forward." <words>229</words> He bit into the impossible fruit, juice running silver down his chin. <words>241</words> "Some echoes are warnings. <words>245</words> Others, invitations." <words>247</words>

The temple bells rang in sharp contrast to the silence that followed them, each chime erasing its own sound. <words>267</words> Kira understood then that the brooch wasn't cursed—it was honest, showing time as it truly was: not a line but a web where every choice echoed both ways through eternity. <words>299</words>

"Why show me this?" she asked. <words>305</words>

"Because street children know hunger," the monk said, gesturing to the perpetually dying and blooming vines. <words>321</words> "And hunger teaches us to harvest hope from darkness, to find sustenance in spaces others call barren." <words>339</words>

Through the brooch's weight against her ribs, Kira felt the echo growing stronger—not distant now but immediate, a voice that was hers but wiser, calling from a future where she'd learned to read not just patterns but their reversals. <words>380</words> The temple had been waiting for someone who understood that survival meant embracing contradiction, that confidence and uncertainty were not opposites but dance partners. <words>404</words>

She left at dawn, or perhaps dusk, the cursed cameo brooch warm against her skin, carrying within it every echo of who she might become. <words>430</words> The lost orchard temple faded behind her, though she suspected she'd been walking toward it all along. <words>448</words>
