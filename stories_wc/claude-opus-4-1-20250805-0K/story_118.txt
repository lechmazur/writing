Dr. Collective always found it uniformly peculiar how individual minds resisted integration, especially here at the facility where tomorrow's spies learned to disappear into crowds. <words>20</words>

Through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery, she sat in her office, watching candle wax drip onto parchment in deliberate patterns—her method of recording sessions that no surveillance could decode. <words>53</words>

Agent Torres knocked, entered, and collapsed into the chair across from her, clutching a scuffed phone charger plug like a talisman. <words>74</words>

"I hear it again," he whispered. <words>80</words>

"The sound of hindsight?" <words>84</words> Dr. Collective asked, her thousand borrowed voices harmonizing into one therapeutic tone. <words>96</words>

He nodded, eyes hollow from weeks of training that taught him to drain himself of identity, to become anyone but himself. <words>117</words>

"It's like... static from choices I haven't made yet, echoing backward." <words>128</words>

She smiled with merry bitterness—the expression of someone who'd absorbed too many minds to remember which smile was originally hers. <words>148</words>

"That's the burden of our work, Agent. <words>155</words> We train you to anticipate every outcome, to live in probability clouds rather than linear time." <words>171</words>

The candle dripped: three dots, a dash, two curves. <words>180</words> In her code, it meant breakthrough imminent. <words>187</words>

"But the sound..." Torres squeezed the charger plug harder, its broken prongs cutting into his palm. <words>203</words>

"Tell me about the plug," she redirected, knowing that objects anchor the ephemeral in reality better than abstract fears. <words>222</words>

"Found it in the temporal training room. <words>229</words> After the accident—when Agent Chen got stuck between timelines." <words>238</words>

Dr. Collective's composite consciousness rippled. <words>243</words> Chen had been her patient too, before the integration failed and scattered him across possibilities. <words>258</words>

"You think it's his?" <words>262</words>

"I know it is. <words>266</words> And when I hold it, I hear what he must have heard—every decision's aftermath singing its regret before the choice gets made." <words>289</words>

The wax pooled, forming a perfect spiral. <words>296</words> Dr. Collective recognized the shape from a future session she hadn't conducted yet. <words>309</words>

"The facility teaches you to be anyone," she said carefully. <words>319</words> "But perhaps Chen discovered something else—how to be everyone, everywhere, all at once." <words>333</words>

Torres laughed, bitter and bright. <words>338</words> "A hive-mind of one person across time?" <words>346</words>

"Stranger things have happened here." <words>351</words> She gestured at herself, a therapist who was also her own support group. <words>364</words>

Through the window, dawn approached like a held breath. <words>373</words> Tomorrow, Torres would attempt Chen's failed experiment, trying to drain time itself of its tyranny. <words>388</words>

Dr. Collective would watch through a thousand eyes, documenting everything in wax, preparing to catch another fragmenting soul or lose another piece of her carefully assembled self. <words>415</words>

The sound of hindsight grew louder, a symphony of choices unmade and paths untaken. <words>429</words>

Torres stood, pocketed the plug, and walked toward his fate with the measured steps of someone who'd already lived through all possible endings. <words>453</words>

The candle wax formed its final shape: a question mark becoming an exclamation point, then melting back into possibility. <words>472</words>
