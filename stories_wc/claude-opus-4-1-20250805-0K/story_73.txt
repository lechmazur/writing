Miguel's calloused hands gripped the vintage magnifying glass, its brass frame worn smooth by generations of gravediggers before him. <words>16</words> The ancient Aztec temple, now converted into Oaxaca's oldest cemetery, thrummed with impossible energy—two worlds pressing against each other like lovers through gauze. <words>40</words>

"I see them," Elena whispered, her confession shattering the evening's careful quiet. <words>52</words>

In the hush that followed, Miguel studied her face through his inherited lens, watching as her features kinderelized—that peculiar transformation when the living briefly wear death's translucent mask. <words>80</words> Through the hush of wind passing a broken fence line at the temple's edge, he heard it: the raucous silence of the overlapping realms, loud as thunder yet soundless as thought. <words>111</words>

For thirty years, Miguel had maintained his diligently whimsical approach to gravedigging, humming old corridos while precisely measuring each plot, leaving marigold petals in patterns that made children laugh and spirits dance. <words>142</words> But tonight was different. <words>146</words> Tonight, the Day of the Dead had arrived three months early, and only he and Elena seemed to notice. <words>165</words>

"Your grandmother taught you the old ways," he said, not a question but recognition. <words>180</words>

Elena nodded, her eyes reflecting both the cemetery's electric lights and the ghostly braziers that shouldn't exist. <words>197</words> "She said someone must preserve the ritual practices, even when the worlds grow thin." <words>212</words>

Miguel handed her the magnifying glass. <words>218</words> Through it, she gasped—the temple's original stone altar shimmered beneath the modern headstones, and processions of ancient priests walked the same paths as tomorrow's mourners. <words>243</words> Time folded like origami. <words>247</words>

"Every generation, one gravedigger sees," Miguel explained, his voice steady despite the cosmic vertigo. <words>261</words> "One who understands that death isn't silence but symphony, not ending but overlap." <words>274</words> He gestured to where conquistadors' bones tangled with Aztec warriors' beneath their feet, all of them dancing now in the liminal space. <words>296</words>

Together, they began the work—not digging graves but opening doorways, carefully maintaining the borders while allowing just enough porousness for love to pass through. <words>320</words> Miguel showed Elena how to read the soil's memory, how to plant crosses that served as tuning forks between frequencies of existence. <words>343</words>

As dawn approached, the overlapping worlds began to separate like oil from water, but slowly, reluctantly. <words>359</words> Elena returned the magnifying glass, understanding now that her confession had been expected, necessary. <words>373</words>

"Tomorrow night, you begin," Miguel said, his retirement both burden and relief. <words>385</words> "Remember—be steady in your movements, whimsical in your spirit. <words>394</words> The dead appreciate both precision and play." <words>401</words>

She would kindrelize nightly now, becoming the bridge between heartbeats and headstones, maintaining the ancient contract in the raucous silence of overlapping worlds. <words>424</words>
