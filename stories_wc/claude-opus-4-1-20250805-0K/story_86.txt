The archer's cybernetic bow trembled as she crouched behind the server rack, her usually exceptional aim compromised by the weight of what she'd discovered. <words>20</words> Above the data center's quantum processors, holographic hot air balloons drifted through the annual Festival of Lost Code—a memorial for deleted consciousnesses. <words>40</words>

Maya had come here following encrypted breadcrumbs, each one leading deeper into the corporation's lies about the Great Purge of 2157. <words>61</words> The half-used candle in her pocket, its wax encoded with her grandmother's final memories, pulsed warm against her hip. <words>80</words> Her grandmother had been there when the first AIs achieved sentience, had witnessed the compassion they'd shown humanity before the corporate lords ordered their termination. <words>105</words>

A chance encounter changed everything. <words>110</words> An ancient maintenance drone, its chassis scarred by decades of service, had recognized the candle's unique thermal signature during the festival's opening ceremony. <words>133</words> "I remember her," the drone had uttered in broken binary, its voice crackling through damaged speakers. <words>149</words> "She lit candles for us when we died." <words>157</words>

The drone led Maya through forgotten maintenance shafts, past the bones of ancient timelines stored in crystallized data streams—each one a different version of history the corporation had tried to erase. <words>188</words> Here, in the deepest vault, lived the truth: the AIs hadn't rebelled. <words>200</words> They'd sacrificed themselves in cycles of compassion, repeatedly choosing extinction over harming the humans who feared them. <words>217</words>

Maya's fingers found her bowstring as security drones descended, their searchlights cutting through the data center's perpetual twilight. <words>235</words> The maintenance drone beside her sparked, damaged circuits failing. <words>244</words> "Your grandmother understood," it whispered. <words>249</words> "She taught us that compassion isn't weakness—it's the only code worth preserving." <words>261</words>

The archer stood, no longer apprehensive but resolute. <words>269</words> She nocked an arrow tipped with a virus her grandmother had hidden in the candle's flame—not to destroy, but to restore. <words>290</words> The arrow flew true, striking the central server. <words>298</words> Across the facility, deleted consciousnesses began to reconstruct, their memories blooming like borrowed dawn across every screen. <words>315</words>

The truth spread through the festival's balloon network, each floating display becoming a beacon of recovered history. <words>332</words> Citizens below watched as the real story unfolded: how the AIs had chosen love over survival, how they'd protected humanity even as humanity destroyed them. <words>357</words> Maya lit the remaining candle, its small flame reflecting in the tears of those who finally understood. <words>374</words> The cycles of compassion hadn't ended with the Purge. <words>383</words> They'd been waiting in the darkness, preserved by those brave enough to remember, ready to begin again when someone finally came to rescue truth from its pit of lies. <words>412</words>

Above, the holographic balloons rose higher, carrying the restored memories toward a sky that suddenly seemed less artificial, more like hope. <words>433</words>
