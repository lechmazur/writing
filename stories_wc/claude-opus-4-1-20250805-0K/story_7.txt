Before the first prayer is whispered by a mortal, when gods still walked unworshipped and unnamed, Maraeth tends her collection in the nectar collection facility. <words>22</words> Each sentient doll hangs suspended in amber pools, their porcelain thoughts rippling through the honeyed substance like dreams through sleep. <words>41</words> She moves between them with her twisted carnival cane, its spiraled wood born from trees that grew in places where reality bent wrong. <words>64</words>

The dolls speak to her in frequencies only she can hear—a chorus of healing that mends the fractures between what is and what must be. <words>90</words> Their voices weave through the facility's crystalline pipes, where nectar flows from flowers that bloom in dimensions mortals will never discover. <words>111</words> Maraeth is expectantly resigned to her purpose: she knows the age of prayer approaches, knows that soon mortals will create boundaries between sacred and profane. <words>137</words>

But she will stride through boundaries once thought sacred. <words>146</words>

Tonight, she follows star paths mapped in the facility's dome ceiling, constellations that shift and breathe like living things. <words>165</words> Each star marks where a doll must be positioned to uphold the architecture of what comes next. <words>183</words> The twisted carnival cane taps against the amber floor, its rhythm matching the pulse of unborn worlds. <words>200</words>

"You understand," she whispers to the newest addition—a doll with obsidian eyes that once belonged to a prophet who saw too far ahead. <words>224</words> "When mortals begin their prayers, they'll build walls around divinity, cage it in temples and rules." <words>240</words> The doll's consciousness flickers agreement through the nectar. <words>248</words>

Maraeth adjusts the doll's position by mere inches, following the star path's precise geometry. <words>262</words> The chorus of healing swells, and she feels it—the moment approaching when mortals will gain voices, will look skyward and wonder. <words>284</words> They'll create gods in their image, never knowing that before their first prayer, collectors like her preserved the raw divine in forms they'd call toys. <words>310</words>

The facility hums with purpose as she works through the eternal night. <words>322</words> Each doll contains a fragment of unstructured holiness, the kind that will become illegal once mortals invent sin. <words>340</words> Her cane strikes the floor three times, a signal to begin the final arrangement. <words>355</words>

The dolls sing their healing chorus louder now, preparing to release what they've held since before time had a name. <words>376</words> Maraeth stands at the center of her collection, expectantly resigned but unbroken, knowing she'll uphold this bridge between the savage divine and the tamed sacred that approaches. <words>404</words> When the first prayer finally rises from mortal lips, her dolls will shatter, their essence flooding through boundaries to keep wonder alive in a world about to discover worship. <words>434</words> Until then, she tends them with ethereal grit, a guardian of thresholds in a nectar-sweet liminal space. <words>451</words>
