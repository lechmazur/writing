Lord Aldrich Vane pressed send on another lie, then watched his artificial hummingbird drone hover above the spontaneous combustion lab's warning signs. <words>20</words> The forgotten noble had inherited this facility along with debts that consumed everything else—title, lands, dignity—leaving only this dangerous playground where objects ignited without warning. <words>45</words> Between text messages to investors who still believed his aristocratic surname meant something, he practiced what he'd never mastered: candor in small moments. <words>68</words>

"The prototype doesn't work," he typed, then deleted it. <words>77</words> The drone's ruby eyes recorded everything—his hands trembling as he fortified his workspace with old ticket stubs from opera houses, polo matches, charity galas. <words>102</words> He'd discovered that reassembling these paper fragments into geometric patterns somehow stabilized the lab's volatile energy fields, a phenomenon mysteriously obvious once observed but impossible to explain. <words>130</words> Each stub represented an evening of performed happiness, and now their honest purposelessness protected him from literal flames. <words>148</words>

His phone buzzed. <words>151</words> "Progress report?" <words>153</words> The venture capitalist wouldn't understand that progress meant admitting the hummingbird wasn't scanning for rare minerals but mapping the exact moment objects decided to burn. <words>178</words> Between this message and his response lay infinity—time enough to cut through illusions he'd spent decades constructing. <words>195</words>

The lab's sensors detected rising temperatures near the centrifuge. <words>204</words> With hollow recklessness, Aldrich moved toward it rather than away, letting the drone follow. <words>218</words> "I've been lying," he said aloud to the empty room, and the honesty felt like swallowing glass. <words>236</words> "The technology works perfectly, but not for mining." <words>244</words> The hummingbird recorded his confession as ticket stubs began curling at their edges, their protective geometry failing. <words>261</words>

He typed quickly: "The lab studies spontaneous combustion in organic matter. <words>272</words> Specifically, how lies accumulate heat until truth becomes inevitable." <words>281</words> Send. <words>282</words>

The centrifuge erupted in white flames, beautiful and terrible. <words>291</words> Through the fire's distortion, Aldrich saw his reflection—not the noble he'd pretended to remain but the bankrupt dreamer he'd become. <words>312</words> The hummingbird drone whirred upward, its footage streaming to investors who'd finally receive something real. <words>327</words> 

Another message arrived: "Are you saying people spontaneously combust from dishonesty?" <words>338</words>

Aldrich laughed, a sound like breaking champagne flutes. <words>346</words> He typed his last message while flames licked closer, his assembled ticket stubs finally surrendering to heat they'd held at bay through sheer nostalgia. <words>370</words> "No. <words>371</words> They combust from the friction between who they were and who they pretend to be." <words>387</words> 

The lab's sprinkler system activated, but Aldrich stood still, letting cold water mix with smoke, finally honest, finally obvious, finally combusting in the only way that mattered. <words>415</words>
