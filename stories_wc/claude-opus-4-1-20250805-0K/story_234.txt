The gentle swordsman Koji arrived at the dinosaur skeleton museum precisely when the orchard dog finally stopped barking at night—3:47 AM, according to the sundial's shadow he'd been tracking for weeks. <words>27</words> His blade remained sheathed; violence wasn't his purpose here. <words>37</words> The empty matchbox in his pocket had once held the coded coordinates, angles scratched inside by his late mentor before the phosphorus tips were used up lighting their final conversation. <words>67</words>

"Faithfully unfaithful," she'd called him with brusque affection, this woman who'd taught him that true loyalty meant betraying small promises to keep greater ones. <words>91</words> He'd left his dojo, abandoned his students, all for this moment beneath the Tyrannosaurus skeleton. <words>107</words>

Koji was a xenophile by nature, drawn to foreign wisdom like moths to flame. <words>121</words> His mentor had been Korean, his blade techniques Persian, his philosophy lifted from extinct Mongolian texts. <words>138</words> But he'd been a late bloomer in understanding what she'd really meant about cradling the universe in a cupped hand. <words>158</words>

The half-painted sundial stood in the museum's center court, its bronze gnomon casting shadows across incomplete Roman numerals. <words>176</words> Someone had abandoned the restoration decades ago, leaving specific angles exposed—angles that only made sense now. <words>192</words> Koji aligned his sword's reflection with the third unpainted edge, watching moonlight refract through the skylight. <words>208</words>

The dinosaur bones began to resonate. <words>214</words>

Not with sound, but with something older—the frequency of deep time itself. <words>227</words> His mentor had discovered it during her archaeological work here, this convergence point where extinction and evolution kissed. <words>245</words> The empty matchbox started to warm against his chest. <words>254</words>

"You're late," he murmured to himself, though the words carried that same brusque affection she'd always shown him. <words>272</words> Forty-three years old before he'd understood that martial arts were just dancing with entropy. <words>287</words> Forty-seven before realizing that his gentle nature wasn't weakness but the universe's own tendency toward kindness despite chaos. <words>305</words>

The sundial's coded angles revealed themselves fully now—not geographic coordinates but temporal ones. <words>319</words> The matchbox crumbled to ash, its purpose complete. <words>328</words> Through the skeletal cathedral of ancient bones, Koji felt it: that impossible moment where all existence could rest in his weathered palm. <words>350</words>

He'd been faithfully unfaithful to everything except this calling. <words>359</words> His students would forgive him eventually. <words>365</words> The universe, cradled briefly in his understanding, whispered secrets in languages that predated words. <words>379</words> The gentle swordsman sheathed his blade with practiced grace, bowing to the Tyrannosaurus as dawn approached. <words>395</words>

Some flowers bloom late but change the entire garden. <words>404</words> Koji walked out, leaving only footprints in museum dust, carrying infinity home. <words>416</words>
