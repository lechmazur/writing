The detached swordsman watched from the scaffolding as the last swipe of paint completed the mural below—a masterpiece depicting the city's founding myth, where machines first learned to dream. <words>23</words> In the futuristic city recycling center, where art and refuse merged in endless cycles, Kaine descended with the practiced grace of someone who'd long ago severed his heart from his blade. <words>54</words>

The secret weavers had sent him here, those invisible architects of fate who stitched reality from discarded moments. <words>72</words> They'd given him only one clue: a piece of sea pottery, worn smooth by waves from an ocean that hadn't existed for three centuries. <words>97</words> Its surface held a pattern—not painted, but woven into the ceramic itself, impossible threads of light that shouldn't exist in dead clay. <words>119</words>

Kaine approached the street artist's bin with what his master once called "loving detachment"—the art of caring deeply while holding nothing. <words>140</words> The artist, still admiring her finished mural, didn't notice him meddle with her discards. <words>155</words> He began reassembling collage scraps she'd thrown away: fragments of holographic paper, pieces of synthetic canvas, strips of memory-foam that retained the ghost-impressions of forgotten images. <words>182</words>

Each scrap whispered its secret. <words>187</words> The weavers had hidden their message here, knowing only someone truly detached could hear the spaces between intentions. <words>205</words> Kaine's fingers moved with playful precision, serious in their dance yet light as laughter. <words>220</words> The sea pottery guided him—when held against each fragment, it revealed which pieces belonged together. <words>236</words>

"You're making art from my garbage?" the muralist called down, amused. <words>247</words>

"Making vows from your prayers," Kaine replied, not looking up. <words>257</words> The collage was forming something impossible: a map that existed in multiple dimensions simultaneously. <words>271</words> The secret weavers' true nature revealed itself—they weren't beings but moments of perfect synchronicity, where random acts aligned into purpose. <words>291</words>

The completed collage showed him what he'd already suspected. <words>300</words> His impossible vow—to cut through time itself and prevent the ocean's death—wasn't about changing the past. <words>316</words> It was about consecrating the present moment when art, garbage, and intention wove together. <words>331</words> The sea pottery pulsed once, recognizing its purpose fulfilled. <words>340</words>

Kaine smiled, understanding finally why the weavers chose him. <words>349</words> Only someone lovingly detached could hold the paradox: to care infinitely while accepting impermanence, to wield a blade that cuts through attachment itself. <words>373</words> He placed the collage into the recycling stream, where it would become part of tomorrow's art. <words>389</words> The vow was consecrated not through completion but through offering—the eternal return of creation from destruction, meaning from chaos. <words>408</words>

The secret weavers smiled through every random moment, and Kaine walked on, carrying nothing but purpose. <words>424</words>
