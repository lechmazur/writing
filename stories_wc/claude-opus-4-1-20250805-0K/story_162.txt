Marcus let the dice tumble across the workbench, their ivory faces catching the fluorescent glare of the reverse engineering workshop. <words>17</words> The fragment of blueprint beneath his palm felt heavier than paper should—encoded titanium alloy specs, stolen from a defense contractor's vault three islands ago. <words>42</words>

"You're still rolling those things?" <words>47</words> Chen's voice drifted from behind towers of obsolete VCRs, their black plastic shells gathering dust like tombstones of analog memory. <words>66</words> The workshop hummed with abandoned technology, machines frozen mid-dissection, their copper entrails exposed. <words>80</words>

Marcus smiled, that easy grin that made border guards wave him through, made suspicious contacts trust him with state secrets. <words>100</words> "Helps me refocus," he said, scooping the dice. <words>108</words> "Besides, you're one to talk about habits." <words>115</words>

Chen emerged, holding a videotape labeled "Kauai '97" in faded marker. <words>126</words> Neither spoke of what that tape contained—footage of the prototype test that killed fourteen engineers, the accident they'd both witnessed as junior technicians. <words>149</words> That shared horror had bound them together more surely than any oath. <words>161</words>

"The buyer arrives tomorrow," Chen said, setting down the tape with deliberate care. <words>174</words> "You sure about this?" <words>178</words>

Marcus unfolded the blueprint fragment, its equations dancing like poetry written in mathematics. <words>191</words> Strange how something so precise could emerge from chaos—just like their plan. <words>203</words> They'd spent months in this workshop, surrounded by the hush of unwatched memories, reverse-engineering not just the weapon but their own escape. <words>226</words>

"Remember that beach on Maui?" <words>231</words> Marcus asked suddenly. <words>234</words> "After the incident, when we just sat there for hours?" <words>244</words>

"You said we'd find a way to make it right." <words>254</words>

"This is it." <words>256</words> Marcus folded the blueprint, tucking it inside a hollowed-out VHS case. <words>267</words> "We sell them the wrong frequency modulation, the weapon becomes useless." <words>278</words> His fingers traced the case's spine. <words>284</words> "Fourteen ghosts get their justice." <words>289</words>

Chen nodded slowly, understanding rippling between them. <words>296</words> In this graveyard of magnetic tape and broken dreams, they'd found their harmony—not in forgetting the island where everything went wrong, but in transforming that memory into purpose. <words>324</words>

Marcus rolled the dice one final time. <words>331</words> Snake eyes. <words>333</words> He laughed, that careless sound that masked careful calculation. <words>342</words> "Perfect odds for imperfect people." <words>347</words>

Tomorrow, the buyer would receive exactly what they'd paid for—a blueprint fragment, genuinely stolen, uniquely trustworthy in its authenticity. <words>366</words> They'd never know it had been altered in this workshop where past and present collided, where two gamblers had bet everything on redemption. <words>390</words>

The videotapes stood silent witness, their magnetic memories coiled tight, holding secrets that would never unspool again. <words>407</words> Marcus and Chen sat in hammered repose, exhausted but certain, their shared burden finally transformed into shared absolution. <words>425</words>
