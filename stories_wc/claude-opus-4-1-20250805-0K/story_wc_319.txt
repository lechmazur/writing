The library guardian had not always been feral. [8] Once, she had worn shoes and combed her hair, had spoken in complete sentences rather than the clicking growls that now echoed through the frozen garden. [28] But three years of defending the monastery's texts from things that crept through dimensional tears had changed her, especially after she'd stolen the cultist's pendant from a dying intruder. [56]

The pendant hung cold against her chest, its obsidian surface drinking light rather than reflecting it. [72] Through it, she could feel her original world—a place where libraries smelled of coffee and old paper, not frost and fear. [93] The homesickness carved hollow spaces in her ribs. [101]

She crouched now among the ice-glazed topiaries, watching mist roll across dead grass that crunched like broken glass beneath her bare feet. [125] The garden existed in perpetual winter since the monks had sealed it, trying to contain what the books had summoned. [146] They hadn't understood that sealing a space only trapped things inside, like her. [159]

Through the veil of sleep—that strange half-state she entered when exhaustion finally claimed her—she could sometimes reach the boundaries of light itself. [182] Not darkness, but the membrane where illumination ended and something else began. [194] The pendant showed her these edges, taught her to wait in the spaces between. [209]

A sound disturbed the mist. [214] Not the familiar scratching of text-parasites or the whisper of pages turning themselves, but footsteps. [229] Human footsteps. [231]

She pressed herself against a frozen fountain, its cherub's face cracked down the middle. [246] The pendant grew warm—it recognized another traveler between worlds. [256]

"Hello?" [257] A voice, uncertain but determined. [262] "The abbott said someone guards the restricted collection." [270]

The guardian's throat produced only a low rumble. [278] Words had become foreign architecture in her mouth. [286] She watched the newcomer emerge from fog: a young scholar clutching a leather satchel, eyes wide with controlled fear. [305]

"I need the Codex of Unraveling," the scholar said. [314] "My sister—she's stuck between dimensions. [319] Started reading from something she shouldn't have." [326]

The guardian understood being stuck. [331] She touched the pendant, feeling how it pulled at reality's seams. [342] Every day she waited here, she internalized more of this frozen exterior world, bringing the garden's endless winter inside herself until ice crystals formed in her thoughts. [367] The monastery's walls had become her skeleton, its sealed windows her eyes. [380]

But this scholar spoke of rescue, of retrieval. [388] Of someone caring enough to cross dimensions for family. [397]

The guardian stood slowly, letting herself be seen. [405] The scholar gasped but didn't run, even when moonlight revealed matted hair, elongated fingers, pupils gone vertical from too much time seeing in library darkness. [429]

"You're human," the scholar breathed. [434] "Or were." [436]

The guardian nodded, then turned, leading the way through maze-like hedges toward the library's secret entrance. [452] Her bare feet left no prints in the frost. [461] She had learned to move like the things she guarded against—weightless, careful, always waiting for the next threat. [479]

Inside, books lined walls that curved impossibly, defying geometry. [488] The guardian pulled the Codex from a shelf that existed only when viewed sideways. [502] She pressed it into the scholar's hands, then touched the cultist's pendant. [514]

The obsidian surface sparked. [518] For a moment, the scholar saw what the guardian saw: the boundaries of light like prison bars, the space between worlds where lost things drifted, the terrible uncertainty that had become her only friend. [549]

"You want to come with me," the scholar said. [559] Not a question. [562]

The guardian's eyes filled—when had she last produced tears? [571] She made a sound between yes and please. [579]

"The Codex can retrieve two," the scholar said softly. [588] "My sister and you. [592] But you'll have to trust the uncertainty of it. [601] Make friends with not knowing if you'll arrive whole." [610]

The guardian had already befriended uncertainty. [616] It lived in her bones now, had taught her patience through endless frozen nights. [630] She removed the pendant, placed it around the scholar's neck. [640] Its weight would anchor them both through the veil. [650]

Together they opened the Codex, and light poured out—not ending at boundaries but dissolving them entirely. [667] The frozen garden began to thaw. [673] The guardian felt her feral nature softening, remembered the taste of words. [685]

"Ready?" the scholar asked. [689]

She waited one last heartbeat in the fog-shrouded garden, then stepped forward into luminous uncertainty, finally going home. [707]
