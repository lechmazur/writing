The ambered observatory deck floated in the nothing-space where time had folded back upon itself, its crystallized walls preserving the last moments of expansion like insects in resin. [27] Keeper Voss ran her fingers across the collection of foreign coins mounted in the navigation panel—currencies from civilizations that would exist, had existed, or might never be at all. [56] 

She cast the coins across the divination matrix with practiced precision, watching them tumble through the non-air, their faces flickering between states of being. [79] The backwards prophecy had been clear: she would know her purpose only after fulfilling it, understanding only through the static bursts of collapsed timelines bleeding through the amber walls. [109]

"Seventh cast," she murmured, quietly enthusiastic despite the stellar doubt that gnawed at her consciousness like background radiation. [128] The coins landed in a pattern she'd seen before—or would see—the temporal grammar making her thoughts slippery. [147] 

After the universe contracts, causality runs in all directions, and Voss had learned to read the static bursts the way ancient sailors read stars. [172] Each burst contained distilled moments from the expansion era, compressed information that her modified consciousness could process only through the ritual of casting lots. [196] The coins weren't just currency; they were anchors to civilizations whose dreams and failures had been encoded in their metal at the quantum level. [221]

A burst crackled through the amber walls—violent purple-white—and Voss pressed her palms against the warm surface, letting the information distill through her nervous system. [247] She saw/would see/had seen herself standing here, making this same choice infinite times, each iteration slightly different, each one necessary. [267] The coins on the matrix began to resonate, their edges blurring as they wavelength aligned with something vast and purposeful. [287]

"The frequency," she whispered, understanding flooding backward from a future moment of clarity. [300] The observatory deck itself was a massive tuning fork, and she was both the striker and the resonance. [318] Her role wasn't to make decisions about the universe's next iteration—it was to become the decision itself, distilled down to pure intention. [342]

The foreign coins rose from the matrix, orbiting her in precise ellipses that traced the geometry of collapsed galaxies. [361] Each coin represented a choice made by civilizations at their peak moment of understanding, preserved now in this amber sanctuary outside of time. [384] Voss cast them again, not to divine the future but to remember what she had already accomplished in the timeline that ran backward from tomorrow. [409]

The static bursts intensified, and through them she could perceive the shape of her purpose: she was the universe's memory of expansion, tasked with preserving the possibility of outward motion in an existence that only knew how to contract. [450] Every cast of the coins created micro-expansions, tiny rebellions against the inward spiral, each one a seed of hope in the collapsing dark. [474]

She thought of the ancient myth of Sisyphus, but reversed—instead of pushing a boulder up a mountain for eternity, she was planting possibilities that would grow backward into the past, creating the very history she was living through. [515] The stellar doubt wasn't uncertainty about her purpose; it was the cognitive dissonance of existing in a causal loop where effect preceded cause. [538]

The coins settled into their final configuration, and Voss smiled with quiet enthusiasm as she recognized the pattern. [555] It was the same arrangement she'd seen in the first static burst, the one that had called her to this amber prison-paradise eons ago—or tomorrow, depending on one's perspective. [583] She had wavelength aligned with her purpose perfectly: to be the eternal caster of lots at the universe's end, ensuring through backward prophecy that there had been a beginning worth contracting from. [615] The foreign coins sang their metallic song through the amber walls, and Keeper Voss prepared for her first cast, having finally understood through infinite repetition what she was about to begin. [646]

In the nothing-space beyond the observatory, the universe continued its ancient breathing, and she was its memory of why it had ever bothered to expand at all. [674]
