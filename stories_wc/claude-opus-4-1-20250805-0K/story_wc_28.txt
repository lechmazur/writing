The tessera gleamed crimson in Sarai's palm, a single piece from the minaret's ruined mosaic, warm despite the frost coating the ancient plaza. [22] She pressed it against the stepping stone where its absence left a gap in the intricate pattern, and the world split open. [43]

Not physically—temporally. [45] The shattered sky above, its perpetual twilight bleeding through cosmic fractures, vanished. [56] Instead, she saw the plaza as it was: before the great fire, when the minaret stood whole and children played between market stalls. [77] She watched herself place this very tessera into fresh mortar, her younger hands steady with purpose. [93] Then the vision released her, leaving her gasping in the present ruins. [105]

This was her curse—to witness the past through objects she'd touched before, trapped in loops of memory whenever she tried to restore what was broken. [131] The Brotherhood of Ash called it divine punishment for her aberrant mercy during the uprising. [146] While others had burned the tyrant's supporters, Sarai had hidden seventeen families in the minaret's prayer rooms. [163] When the fires came anyway, she'd saved who she could, renamed them with new identities scratched into clay tablets, gave them chances to disappear. [187]

Now she returned nightly to this plaza, compelled by something deeper than guilt. [200] The stepping stones formed a spiral path to where the minaret once stood, each one bearing part of the same mosaic that had adorned the tower—geometric patterns that, when whole, spelled out the ninety-nine names of divine compassion. [239] The great fire had scattered the pieces, but the stones remained, chipped and blackened. [253]

She knelt, fitting the tessera into place. [260] Another vision seized her: the fire itself, roaring through the plaza while she shepherded refugees through smoke. [276] She saw herself stumbling over this very stone, dropping the tessera she'd pried loose as a keepsake. [293] The memory released her, and she found herself weeping—not from sorrow, but from a strange, cold warmth. [310]

"You return again," said a voice. [316] An old man emerged from shadow, one of the renamed ones she'd saved. [329] She recognized him by his limp, though his face bore scars that hadn't existed in the before-time. [347]

"The stones remember," she said simply. [353]

He nodded, understanding her burden. [358] "The Brotherhood seeks you. [362] They say you blaspheme by trying to restore sacred things with unclean hands." [375]

"My hands were never clean," Sarai replied, tracing the chipped patterns where her tessera now rested. [391] "But mercy isn't about purity." [397]

The stone beneath her fingers grew warm. [404] Not another vision this time, but something else—a sensation like embracing hot iron with bare flesh, painful and necessary. [423] The mosaic's pattern shifted subtly, the geometric lines realigning to spell out a new name among the ninety-nine: Sarai, the Gentle Radical. [447]

The old man gasped. [451] "The stones... they've accepted you." [457]

She stood slowly, understanding flooding through her. [464] Her retrocognitive curse wasn't punishment—it was invitation. [471] Each vision showed her not just what was, but what could be again. [483] Not the same, but transformed. [488] The plaza would never recover its former glory, the minaret would remain fallen, but something new could grow from these fragments. [509]

"Tell the Brotherhood," she said, her voice carrying the warm coldness of necessary change, "that I'm not restoring anything. [527] I'm creating space for what comes next." [535]

She placed her hand on another damaged stone, ready for the vision it would bring. [551] This time, she saw not the past but possibility: refugees returning, building new homes from old stones, the plaza becoming a garden where the shattered sky's strange light nurtured impossible plants. [583] 

The vision ended, leaving her with purpose sharp as winter wind. [594] She would rename this place not through words but through action, cradling empathy in arms of steel—strong enough to hold the weight of transformation, gentle enough to preserve what mattered. [624] Tomorrow, she would begin gathering the scattered, inviting them to help her arrange the broken pieces into new patterns. [643] 

Tonight, she would simply kneel among the stones, retrocognitively trapped but finally free, learning the shape of aberrant mercy one tessera at a time. [668]

The shattered sky watched, its fractures spreading starlight across the ancient plaza like a promise. [683]
