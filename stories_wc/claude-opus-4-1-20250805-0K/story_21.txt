Ambassador Chen pressed the fox tail tassel between her fingers, its coarse hair still stained with the blood of the bandit who'd worn it when he murdered her daughter. <words>28</words> The forgotten city hall echoed with drum circles from the squatters' commune below, their rhythm penetrating the shuttered children's theater where she waited. <words>51</words> 

The musty scent triggered memories—her daughter's last performance here, before the city abandoned this building, before everything changed. <words>70</words> Chen had tracked the bandit's genetic patterns through black market databases, discovering his organically synthetic modifications: lab-grown neurons woven through natural tissue, making him faster, crueler. <words>97</words>

"You jest," the informant had said when she'd revealed her plan. <words>108</words> But Chen understood revenge's arithmetic better than most diplomats. <words>117</words> She'd spent three years maintaining her measured facade while secretly learning to decode the genetic signatures that these modified criminals left behind—skin cells, hair follicles, blood drops. <words>144</words>

The drums intensified. <words>147</words> Through the theater's broken window, she watched the bandit enter the city hall's main chamber, unaware that she'd lured him here with false intelligence about a government cache. <words>175</words> His own modifications would betray him; she'd engineered a virus targeting his specific genetic sequence, hidden in the dust of these abandoned seats. <words>199</words>

He swaggered past the moth-eaten curtains, and she spoke with abrasive calm: "The fox tail you wore—did you take it before or after you killed her?" <words>226</words>

Recognition flickered across his enhanced eyes. <words>232</words> "The diplomat's brat? <words>235</words> She squealed—" <words>237</words>

Chen released the aerosol, watching his organically synthetic nervous system begin its programmed deterioration. <words>251</words> "I've learned that revenge costs exactly what you're willing to become," she said, her diplomatic training keeping her voice level despite the satisfaction burning through her chest. <words>278</words>

The bandit collapsed, neurons misfiring in cascading failure. <words>286</words> Chen pocketed the fox tail tassel—evidence and memorial both. <words>296</words> The drum circles continued below, oblivious to the justice dispensed in their forgotten sanctuary. <words>310</words> She'd spent three years transforming from peace-broker to predator, abandoning every principle she'd once defended. <words>326</words>

As his breathing stopped, the musty theater air seemed to clear, though Chen knew this was imagination. <words>344</words> She'd decoded not just his genetic patterns but her own capacity for cold violence. <words>359</words> The price of revenge, she realized, was becoming someone her daughter wouldn't recognize. <words>373</words>

Yet standing there amid the drum circles' primal rhythm, holding the bloodstained tassel, Chen felt no regret. <words>390</words> Some transformations, like the bandit's synthetic evolution, couldn't be reversed. <words>400</words> She left through the same broken door she'd entered, a diplomat no longer. <words>414</words>
