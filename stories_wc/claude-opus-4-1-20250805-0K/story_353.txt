Martha, a small-town baker with flour-dusted hands and a cynically gentle smile, pressed the last petal between wax paper as the emergency time machine garage hummed around her. <words>24</words> The pressed flowers weren't mere decorations—each bloom carried the seeds of contagion, a temporal virus that would unravel the tyrant's grip on history itself. <words>48</words> She had tracked moon patterns for seventeen years, noting how lunar phases affected the machine's calibration, learning to exceed the manufacturer's limitations through patience and sourdough starter. <words>74</words> 

"When shadows learn to speak," the manual had warned, "the timeline becomes permeable." <words>87</words> Tonight, as darkness whispered prophecies against the garage's corrugated walls, Martha knew the moment had arrived. <words>103</words> The tyrant—who had rewritten time to crown himself eternal emperor—had never suspected a baker would master chronological sabotage. <words>121</words> Her cynically gentle nature served her well; she smiled at his propaganda posters while kneading revolution into tomorrow's bread. <words>140</words>

The pressed flowers trembled in their protective sleeves, each one harvested during specific lunar eclipses when reality grew thin. <words>159</words> Martha had discovered that organic matter retained temporal memory better than any synthetic compound the tyrant's scientists produced. <words>177</words> By tracking moon patterns, she could predict when the time streams would align, creating windows where her contaminated flowers could take root in the past. <words>202</words>

The garage had been abandoned after the tyrant declared time travel illegal for civilians, but Martha had claimed it under baker's salvage rights—nobody questioned someone who fed the community. <words>231</words> She loaded the pressed flowers into the machine's bio-chamber, their seeds of contagion ready to bloom backwards through decades. <words>250</words> These weren't weapons of destruction but of restoration, designed to return free will to moments the tyrant had stolen. <words>269</words>

As shadows began their ancient dialogue, speaking truths that predated the tyrant's reign, Martha activated the sequence she'd perfected. <words>288</words> The machine roared, exceeding every safety parameter, pushing beyond what its creators thought possible. <words>303</words> She was cynically gentle even in rebellion—the contagion wouldn't kill, only restore the authentic timeline where the tyrant remained an unremarkable clerk. <words>326</words>

The pressed flowers dissolved into temporal streams, their seeds spreading through yesterday's soil. <words>339</words> Martha watched the gauge tracking moon patterns fluctuate wildly as her virus took hold. <words>354</words> In the emergency time machine garage, surrounded by the speaking shadows of what once was and what would be again, she felt the timeline shudder and correct. <words>381</words> Tomorrow, she would wake to knead bread in a free world, where her cynically gentle smile would finally match the joy in her flour-dusted hands. <words>407</words>
