Mira Chen had been a professional scapegoat for seventeen years, taking blame for corporate scandals, political missteps, and family disgraces—always for the right price. <words>24</words> In the cloud city of Stratos, where buildings floated on magnetic fields seven thousand feet above the earth, identity was currency, and she had abandoned hers completely. <words>50</words> After the last library card gets returned to the desk at closing time, when the archivists sleep and the databases dream, she begins her real work. <words>76</words>

Tonight, like every midnight for the past three months, her phone rings with its cryptic caller. <words>92</words> "The washer," the voice whispers, robustly delicate in its contradiction—strong enough to pierce her concentration yet fragile as frost. <words>111</words> She holds the metal washer between her fingers, this ordinary hardware store purchase that arrived in her mail six weeks ago, unmarked. <words>133</words> Its center hole frames nothing, yet she knows it contains everything she needs to decode the sacred symbols etched into Stratos's foundation pillars. <words>156</words>

The voice continues its nightly instructions, each call building upon the last, teaching her to refashion not the washer itself but her understanding of it. <words>181</words> "Turn it counterclockwise while looking through," the voice says with obsessive calm that mirrors her own practiced detachment. <words>199</words> "See how the city's lights blur into patterns." <words>207</words> She obeys, and suddenly the washer becomes a lens, transforming the gleaming towers into ancient script she almost recognizes. <words>226</words>

For years, she had worn other people's sins like costumes, each assignment stripping away another layer of who she'd been—prosecutor, daughter, believer. <words>249</words> But these symbols promise something different: not another mask to wear but the original face beneath all masks. <words>267</words> The caller knows this, has always known, selecting her precisely because she had already abandoned identity so thoroughly that she could see past the illusion of individual existence. <words>295</words>

"Tomorrow night is the last call," the voice says. <words>304</words> "Bring the washer to the foundation of Tower Seven." <words>313</words> She agrees without emotion, though her pulse quickens. <words>321</words> Every scapegoat assignment had been preparation for this moment—learning to carry weight that wasn't hers, to dissolve into necessity. <words>340</words> 

As dawn approaches, she holds the washer up to the first light breaking through Stratos's eternal clouds. <words>357</words> Through its perfect circle, she glimpses the truth: the sacred symbols aren't a code to break but a mirror to remember. <words>378</words> The city itself is the abandoned identity, humanity's discarded dream of transcendence made manifest in steel and glass. <words>395</words> And she, the professional bearer of others' guilt, will finally refashion herself into something unnamed and necessary, something robustly delicate as the morning itself. <words>419</words> Tomorrow at midnight, she will answer the last call and step through the washer's hole into whatever waits beyond identity itself. <words>440</words>
