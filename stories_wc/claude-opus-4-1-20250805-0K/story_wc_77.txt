The mirrors still held their light, though the carnival had been dead for seven years. [14] Mara pressed her palm against the funhouse entrance, feeling the warmth that shouldn't exist, the lingering luminance that made her stomach turn with fascination. [38] She'd died here once—technically died—before the paramedics brought her back with their violent electricity and desperate compressions. [55]

"Don't trust what you see," whispered Cornelius from behind her left shoulder, his voice like silk being pulled through broken glass. [76] Her advisor since the resuscitation, he existed only in periphery, visible solely in reflections and chrome surfaces. [93] The doctors called him a hallucination, but hallucinations didn't know things that proved true. [107]

Inside, the funhouse breathed with bioluminescent mold that had conquered every surface, transforming the attraction into something between decay and divinity. [127] The smell made her gag—sweet rot mixed with ozone—yet she couldn't stop inhaling deeply. [143] This repulsive allure had drawn her back nightly, searching. [152]

"The clasp," Cornelius hissed. [156] "Show it the clasp." [160]

Mara fingered the antique opera cloak clasp at her throat, its ruby eye pulsing in rhythm with the fungal glow. [180] She'd stolen it from her grandmother's jewelry box the night before she first died here, and it had been fused to her skin ever since she'd returned. [209] The metal was always ice-cold, always photographing her memories onto its surface—but the images showed only her fears, never her joys. [232]

The funhouse had become photographically cursed too, its mirrors capturing and projecting the terror of everyone who'd ever walked through. [252] Children's screams played on loop in frequencies only she could hear. [264] But tonight, she would unbosom the secret that fear itself was keeping. [277]

"The dream dictionary," Cornelius reminded her, his reflection fragmenting across seven warped mirrors. [291] "Page 394." [293]

She pulled out the water-damaged book she'd found in the defunct ticket booth, its pages filled with paradoxical notes that contradicted themselves with each reading. [318] *'Fear dreams of being forgotten,'* one line read. [326] Below it: *'Fear forgets what dreams of being.'* [334]

The mirrors began to pulse faster. [340] Something was coming. [343]

"Read them backwards," Cornelius urged, his form solidifying slightly in the carnival glass. [356] "Fear doesn't understand reversal." [361]

Mara spoke the paradoxical notes in reverse order, and the funhouse shuddered. [373] The photographically cursed walls began projecting her death—her real death—the moment before resuscitation. [388] But this time, she saw what she'd missed: a shadow behind her falling body, shaped like terror itself, weeping. [408]

"Fear was lonely," she breathed, understanding flooding through her like formaldehyde. [419] "It killed me because it wanted a companion who could see it truly." [433]

The opera cloak clasp grew warm for the first time, its ruby eye opening wider. [449] In its reflection, she saw Fear manifesting—not as monster but as child, ancient and afraid of its own nature. [469] It had been trapped here, feeding on screams but starving for understanding. [482]

"Now," Cornelius whispered, and she realized he'd been Fear's first victim, transformed into her guide to lead her back. [502] "Tell it what it needs to hear." [509]

Mara approached the child-thing, its form shifting between beautiful and grotesque with each heartbeat. [524] "You're afraid of being afraid," she said simply. [533] "But fear of fear is just another mirror. [542] Break it." [544]

The paradox shattered Fear's grip on the funhouse. [553] The lingering luminance exploded outward, then contracted to a single point of light in the opera clasp. [571] The mirrors went dark, finally ordinary. [577] Cornelius smiled once—genuinely—before dissolving into morning. [584]

Mara walked out of the dead funhouse, carrying Fear transformed into something smaller, manageable, almost beautiful in its containment. [603] The ruby eye closed, satisfied. [609] She'd tricked Fear into revealing its weakness: the desperate need to be understood rather than fled from. [627] The photographs on the clasp showed different scenes now—children laughing, lovers kissing, lives lived fully despite the shadow. [647] The repulsive allure remained, but now she controlled it rather than the reverse. [661] The abandoned carnival stood silent behind her, finally allowed its rest. [672]
