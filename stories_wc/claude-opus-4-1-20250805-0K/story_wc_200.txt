The crocodile's tooth hung from Mara's neck, its ivory surface worn smooth by centuries of spectral confessions whispered against it. [19] She stood at the entrance to Echo Gorge as darkness began its retreat, waiting for that precise moment when hidden sunrise would paint the canyon walls with light too new for shadows. [50] 

As a lost soul collector, she had learned that the wandering dead spoke most truthfully in those hushed minutes before dawn fully claimed the sky. [75] The tooth—pulled from an ancient beast that had once swallowed a saint whole—served as her compass, growing warm when the confused spirits drew near. [100]

A sound drifted from the gorge's depths: the distorted notes of a misaligned harp, each string bent wrong by grief. [120] Mara knew this particular music. [125] Three weeks ago, a traveling musician had fallen here, his instrument shattering against the rocks, his soul caught between the echoes of his final performance and the silence he feared most. [156]

She descended the narrow path, modestly fearless in her practiced steps. [167] The gorge amplified everything—footfalls became thunderclaps, whispers became screams, and the harp's broken melody folded into itself until it sounded like weeping made of music. [193]

"Thomas," she called softly, and her voice returned to her sevenfold. [205] "Thomas, I've come to hear your confession." [212]

The spectral musician materialized slowly, his translucent fingers still attempting to tune strings that would never align. [229] His mouth opened and closed without sound at first, the way all lost souls struggled when first attempting their confessions. [250]

"I never learned," he finally managed, his voice threading through the harp's discordant notes. [265] "Never learned to laugh at my mistakes." [272]

Mara touched the crocodile's tooth, feeling its warmth pulse with Thomas's pain. [284] This was why she had chosen to pursue him specifically among the many lost souls wandering the gorge. [302] His confession revealed not sin but sorrow, not guilt but the absence of joy. [316]

"Tell me about your last performance," she said, sitting on a ledge where the first hints of sunrise began to bronze the eastern wall. [340]

Thomas's form flickered as he remembered. [346] "A wedding feast. [349] The bride requested a waltz, but I played it in minor key by accident." [363] His ghostly fingers trembled on the phantom strings. [371] "The guests went silent. [375] The bride's mother wept. [379] I fled in shame, took the mountain path at night, and—" [390]

"And fell," Mara finished gently. [395] "But Thomas, what if the bride preferred it that way? [405] What if her tears were from beauty, not disappointment?" [414]

The harp's notes shifted slightly, still broken but reaching for something like harmony. [427]

Mara stood and began to hum, deliberately off-key, weaving her voice through his fractured music. [443] She stumbled over notes, laughed at her errors, and continued anyway. [454] "This is how we integrate laughter into healing," she said between verses. [466] "We make mistakes into music." [471]

The hidden sunrise was fully arriving now, its light catching the moisture in the air and turning the gorge into a cathedral of gold. [495] Thomas watched her, and for the first time since his death, his phantom mouth curved into something approaching a smile. [515]

"I was so afraid," he confessed, the words flowing freely now. [527] "Afraid that imperfection meant worthlessness." [533]

The crocodile's tooth grew almost hot against Mara's chest. [542] This was the moment—when confession met comprehension, when the lost soul finally understood what had kept them tethered. [560]

"Play it wrong," she urged him. [566] "Play it broken and beautiful." [571]

Thomas lifted his ghostly hands to the misaligned harp, and instead of trying to correct its distortion, he embraced it. [591] The melody that emerged was neither perfect nor purely discordant, but something achingly luminous—a song that knew its own flaws and loved them. [615]

As the last note echoed through the gorge, multiplied and magnified by stone and sunrise, Thomas's form began to dissolve into light. [637] Not disappearing but integrating, becoming part of the morning's glow. [647]

"Thank you," he whispered, and then he was gone, leaving only the faint impression of laughter in the warming air. [667]

Mara touched the crocodile's tooth, now cool again, and smiled her own imperfect smile. [681] Another soul collected, another confession heard, another healing born from the marriage of sorrow and joy. [697] She turned to climb back up the path, already sensing the next lost soul stirring somewhere in the canyon's depths, waiting for tomorrow's hidden sunrise. [723]

The gorge held their music, imperfect and eternal. [731]
