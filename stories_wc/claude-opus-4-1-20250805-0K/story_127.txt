The brass pipes of the Vermillion Lounge hissed their steam-song between acts, and Marcel's fingers trembled against the rusted knight's gauntlet he'd worn for seventeen years. <words>22</words> He sat at the mahogany bar, watching the clock tick toward his next performance, knowing Viktor would arrive between calls—between the scheduled shows that kept the lounge's patrons distracted. <words>50</words>

The gauntlet had once belonged to Viktor's grandfather, stolen during the night Marcel betrayed the Guild. <words>66</words> Now it served as both his street performer's signature prop and his penance, its oxidized joints grinding with each movement like accusations. <words>88</words> But lately, even this talisman couldn't summon his usual illusions; his creativity had dried up like oil in overworked gears. <words>107</words>

"Your usual, Monsieur?" <words>110</words> The bartender's question carried layers—everyone here spoke in codes since the Guild Wars ended. <words>124</words>

Marcel nodded, his good hand tracing the bar's surface, its texture unexpectedly rough beneath layers of lacquer. <words>141</words> The sensation triggered something: a memory of diving off the southern colonies before the world turned to steam and copper, his young fingers exploring a coral reef's intricate architecture. <words>170</words> He'd been eight, Viktor nine, brothers in all but blood, discovering hidden caves where fish darted like silver thoughts. <words>189</words>

The memory unlocked what his conscious mind had buried. <words>198</words> Viktor hadn't betrayed him first—Marcel had imagined the slight, had twisted innocent words into threats, had struck preemptively at shadows. <words>217</words> The Guild's paranoia had infected him like rust spreading through iron, making him see enemies where only friends stood. <words>236</words>

The lounge door opened. <words>240</words> Viktor entered, his mechanical eye whirring as it focused on Marcel's gauntleted hand. <words>253</words> Between them stretched seventeen years of pursued and pursuer, of coded messages left at dead drops, of almost-meetings that ended in violence. <words>276</words>

Marcel stood slowly, his performer's instincts screaming to run, to hide behind another act. <words>290</words> Instead, he began removing the gauntlet, each buckle a confession, each leather strap an admission. <words>305</words> The coral's ghost-texture still tingled on his fingertips—that rough honesty of natural things before the world became all gears and grudges. <words>327</words>

"I remember," Marcel said, his voice carrying despite the lounge's ambient noise. <words>339</words> "I remember what actually happened." <words>344</words>

Viktor's good eye—the human one—flickered with something that might have been hope. <words>356</words> Marcel extended the gauntlet, not as surrender but as return, offering the peace that only truth could forge. <words>373</words>

"Your grandfather's," Marcel whispered, the words coded but clear: I was wrong. <words>385</words> I destroyed us for nothing. <words>390</words> Can we begin again? <words>394</words>

Viktor took the gauntlet, his fingers brushing Marcel's—rough like coral, honest like memory, warm like trust preparing to rebuild itself between calls, between heartbeats, between two men who'd forgotten they were once boys who dove for wonders together. <words>434</words>
