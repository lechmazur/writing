Marcus descended through murky harbor waters by day, but tonight he stood inside the Celestial Wreck, a nightclub carved from the city's abandoned planetarium. <words>19</words> The dome's cracked projection screens flickered with nebulae while bass thrummed through steel beams he'd once welded underwater. <words>37</words> His grandmother's vintage button box weighed heavy in his jacket pocket—each mother-of-pearl disc supposedly a fragment of borrowed time. <words>57</words> 

He was patiently impatient, counting breaths between lightning-quick glances at the antique mirrors lining the club's walls. <words>74</words> The mirrors had been salvaged from Madame Corvina's Vintage Emporium before it burned, and through them, Marcus glimpsed not reflections but refracted moments. <words>98</words> A woman in 1920s pearls sipped champagne where a punk rocker now stood; a Victorian gentleman adjusted his cufflinks in the space occupied by strobing lights. <words>124</words>

The unraveling had begun three weeks ago when Marcus first opened his grandmother's box. <words>138</words> She'd whispered about the buttons on her deathbed—how they weren't meant for clothes but for fastening timelines together. <words>157</words> "Our family guards the seams," she'd said, her fingers trembling against his diving-calloused palms. <words>172</words> "Where past and future cross, someone must hold them steady." <words>182</words>

But Marcus didn't want to hold anything steady. <words>190</words> He wanted to wield the improbable power she'd hidden from him, to manipulate the crossing points where parallel histories kissed. <words>210</words> Each button could unravel a single moment, letting him splice yesterday into tomorrow, creating impossible advantages. <words>226</words> The underwater work that destroyed his lungs could be undone; the accident that took his brother could be prevented. <words>245</words>

He pressed a button against the nearest mirror. <words>253</words> The glass rippled like water, and suddenly he saw himself in diving gear, welding the very beams that now supported the nightclub's architecture—but in this timeline, the planetarium had never closed. <words>285</words> Stars still wheeled overhead while couples danced through constellations. <words>294</words> His brother stood beside him, alive, laughing at something Marcus couldn't hear. <words>306</words>

The moment began unraveling faster. <words>311</words> The nightclub's walls flickered between states—pristine planetarium, construction site, underwater ruins, dance floor. <words>324</words> Patrons phased in and out of existence, their drinks suspended mid-air between realities. <words>338</words> Marcus realized his grandmother hadn't hidden power from him; she'd protected him from this inherited mystery that demanded everything. <words>358</words>

To pamper himself with revised histories meant shredding the fabric for everyone else. <words>371</words> The vintage buttons weren't tools but patches, and his family hadn't guarded seams—they'd desperately mended tears. <words>388</words> As timelines hemorrhaged through the mirrors, Marcus understood he could either wield catastrophic power or inherit his grandmother's patient duty. <words>408</words> With trembling fingers, he began threading buttons back through reality's buttonholes, one careful stitch at a time. <words>425</words> The Celestial Wreck solidified around him, the crossing sealed, his brother still gone but the world intact. <words>442</words> Marcus returned to the harbor at dawn, descending into dark water where broken things waited for patient hands. <words>460</words>
