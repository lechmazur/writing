The abandoned spaceport hangar stretched vast and hollow, its rusted beams casting shadows like ancient cathedral bones. <words>14</words> Mira, a professional cuddler by trade, stood clutching the phantom train ticket punch she'd discovered at yesterday's farmer's market—a chance encounter with the vendor who'd pressed it into her palm, whispering, "You'll need this where you're going." <words>53</words>

The punch felt unusually usual in her grip, simultaneously foreign and familiar, as if her muscles remembered movements her mind had forgotten. <words>75</words> Around her, the hangar held that peculiar hush before an acceptance speech begins, though no crowd gathered, no podium stood waiting. <words>96</words> Only the decay of forgotten launches perfumed the air with rust and old fuel. <words>110</words>

She'd come here to overcome a deep-seated prejudice—her grandmother's warning that "those who touch strangers for comfort invite darkness." <words>129</words> For three years, she'd held bodies through grief, through loneliness, through the simple human need for warmth, yet her grandmother's words still haunted her professional embraces. <words>155</words> The vendor had seen it in her eyes, that shadow of shame she carried. <words>169</words>

"The unspoken rules govern more than we know," he'd said, pointing to this place. <words>183</words>

Now, standing where rockets once pierced heaven, Mira understood. <words>192</words> The hangar breathed with ancient novelty—old futures that never came to pass, dreams that decayed before they could launch. <words>211</words> She raised the ticket punch to the air, and it began to click and whisper on its own, punching holes in nothing, creating passages through absence itself. <words>238</words>

With each phantom perforation, memories emerged: astronauts who'd needed holding before their journeys, engineers who'd wept in relief after safe returns, all the embraces that had happened here when it was alive. <words>270</words> The punch was recording them, validating journeys of human connection that required no spacecraft. <words>284</words>

The unspoken rules revealed themselves—not her grandmother's fears, but older truths. <words>295</words> That comfort given freely travels farther than any rocket. <words>304</words> That professional distance and genuine care could coexist like binary stars. <words>314</words> That some tickets are punched not for destinations, but for permission to be human. <words>328</words>

As the punch finally stilled, Mira felt the prejudice dissolve like old metal in rain. <words>343</words> She was not inviting darkness; she was holding space for light in its absence. <words>357</words> The hangar seemed to exhale decades of waiting, and in that breath, she heard the acceptance speech it had always been preparing—not words, but the sound of connection acknowledging itself. <words>388</words>

She pocketed the punch and walked back toward her practice, where bodies waited for the unusually usual miracle of being held without judgment, their unspoken needs finally finding voice through simple, ancient touch. <words>421</words>
