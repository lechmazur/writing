The junkyard prophet knelt among the fog sculptures, their vapor forms dissolving and reforming like memories he couldn't quite hold. [19] Each morning, Ezra forgot the visions that would come to pass, remembering only after they'd already happened—a curse that left him perpetually chasing echoes of futures he'd once known. [48]

The sculpture garden stretched along the abandoned boardwalk where artists had installed machines that carved temporary forms from coastal mist. [68] Now only three still functioned, their mechanical lungs breathing shapes that lasted seconds before the ocean wind scattered them. [87] Ezra lived here among salvaged things: shopping carts filled with VHS tapes no one would watch again, their magnetic ribbons holding conversations and birthdays and first steps that had outlived their purpose. [119]

He pulled the piece of plain chalk from his coat pocket, worn smooth from years of marking. [136] Every dawn, he wrote prophecies on the driftwood he'd arranged as directional markers throughout the garden, creating a maze only he could navigate. [159] By noon, he'd forget what he'd written. [167] By evening, the words would prove true. [174] By night, he'd remember having known them all along. [184]

The chalk scraped against salt-weathered wood: "She will come seeking the frequency of age." [199] He didn't know who 'she' was, but his morning prophecies were never wrong, even when his precognitive amnesia made him their bewildered witness rather than their author. [227]

Ezra wandered deeper into his driftwood labyrinth, following yesterday's markers toward the center where he kept his most precious salvage—a wall of broken televisions playing only static. [256] The white noise contained something he desperately needed to locate: the exact sound of time passing through a human body. [276] He'd been searching for this frequency for seven years, ever since the accident at the recycling plant had scrambled his relationship with time. [300]

The fog sculptures breathed around him, and in their shifting forms he saw the woman approaching before he forgot he'd seen her. [323] She carried a recording device older than the videotapes, its analog reels spinning slowly. [338]

"You wrote that I would come," she said, pointing to his morning's chalk prophecy on the nearest driftwood marker. [357]

Ezra studied his own handwriting with surprise, then recognition, then the strange sorrow of understanding he'd known this moment would arrive but had lost it to his peculiar forgetfulness. [387] "You're looking for something in the static," he said, not quite a question. [401]

She nodded, moving toward the television wall where electromagnetic ghosts flickered in the fog. [416] "My grandmother recorded her voice every year on her birthday, just saying her age. [431] The tapes degraded, but the pattern might still be there—the way her voice changed, decade by decade." [449]

Ezra understood with the clarity that came only in these moments when prophecy and present intersected. [465] This was why he'd built the labyrinth, why he'd collected the unwatched tapes, why he'd arranged the driftwood to channel visitors toward this precise spot. [491] His forgetting was not a curse but a kindness—it kept him from interfering with what needed to happen. [509]

Together they adjusted the televisions, tuning through layers of magnetic decay while fog sculptures bloomed and died around them. [529] The ocean pulled at the shore below with its ancient rhythm, and in that tidal longing, Ezra felt the same force that pulled memories through time, degrading and preserving them simultaneously. [561]

Then they found it: a whisper between channels, numbers spoken in ascending order, a voice growing thinner and richer with each passing year. [585] The woman wept as her grandmother counted through decades, the sound of growing older preserved in deteriorating plastic, clinging to echoes that refused to disappear entirely. [613]

Ezra picked up his chalk and wrote on fresh driftwood: "Tomorrow you will remember having helped her today." [631] He wouldn't recall writing it until the prophecy had passed, but for now, in this moment between forgetting and remembering, he felt the profound weight of time moving through them both, inevitable as the tide. [668]

The fog sculptures reached toward them like solid dreams, and the unwatched videotapes continued their vigil, holding their secrets in magnetic suspension, waiting for someone else to come seeking the sounds they'd lost. [703]

When morning came, Ezra would read his own prophecy with surprise, then guide the next seeker through his driftwood maze, forever locating what had already been found, forever forgetting what he'd always known. [737]

The chalk grew smaller in his pocket, wearing away like years. [748]
