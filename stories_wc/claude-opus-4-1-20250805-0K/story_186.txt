In the suspended palace that swayed from colossal stalactites above the dying lowlands, Elara the tinkerer pressed her brass thermometer against the final automaton's copper heart. <words>26</words> The instrument had measured more than temperature for decades—it chronicled the fever of a world slowly burning, each degree marking another species vanished, another glacier retreated. <words>52</words> 

She had sculpted seventeen carnival fortune-tellers from salvaged metals, each one designed to pop up across the continent's remaining settlements with oddly truthful prophecies about environmental collapse. <words>79</words> Not mystical predictions, but practical illusions: mechanical soothsayers whose cards revealed migration patterns, water table depths, and the precise years until local extinction events. <words>103</words>

The palace groaned against its mineral anchors as another tremor rippled through the cavern ceiling. <words>118</words> Elara's hands, stained green from copper work, trembled not from the quake but from knowledge—the thermometer's final reading confirmed what she'd suspected. <words>141</words> The stalactites themselves were warming, their ancient ice cores melting. <words>151</words> Her elevated sanctuary would fall within the season. <words>159</words>

She wound the eighteenth automaton's mainspring, watching its painted eyes flutter open with mechanical life. <words>174</words> This last fortune-teller would be different. <words>180</words> While its siblings dispersed data about soil acidity and rainfall patterns, this one would speak of endings—not just ecological, but personal. <words>201</words> Elara had encoded her own remaining heartbeats into its brass gears, synchronizing its prophecies with her failing pulse. <words>219</words>

"Begin," she whispered, and the automaton's hinged mouth opened. <words>228</words>

In that singular moment—like an artist's brush first kissing canvas, pregnant with infinite possibility yet irreversibly committed—the fortune-teller spoke its first and most important truth: "The tinkerer who built us understood that confronting mortality meant accepting both endings and beginnings. <words>267</words> She knew the world below would need more than warnings. <words>277</words> They would need memory-keepers, data-prophets, mechanical witnesses to what was and what could be." <words>291</words>

The automaton's voice rang through the palace chambers as Elara activated the deployment mechanism. <words>305</words> Seventeen fortune-tellers would descend on brass cables tonight, carrying their creator's chronicle of temperature rises, species migrations, and adaptation strategies to the scorched settlements below. <words>332</words> The eighteenth would remain, preserving her methods, her measurements, her whimsical defiance against despair. <words>346</words>

Elara placed the brass thermometer in the automaton's hand—her final gift. <words>357</words> The instrument that had measured the world's fever would now teach others to read the symptoms. <words>373</words> As the palace shuddered again, she smiled at her practical magic: salvation disguised as carnival wonder, science dressed in mystic robes, truth delivered through the measured illusion of prophecy. <words>402</words> The suspended palace would fall, but her fortune-tellers would rise, carrying environmental memory into an uncertain future. <words>419</words>
