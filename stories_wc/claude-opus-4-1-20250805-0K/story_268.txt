Marcus sat in the abandoned airport waiting area, his laptop screen casting blue shadows across rows of empty seats that hadn't held passengers since the war began. <words>24</words> The virtual call connected, showing his handler's pixelated face, but Marcus barely listened, rolling the plain wooden bead between his fingers—the only remnant of his grandmother's prayer necklace, destroyed in the first bombing. <words>63</words>

"Your target frequents the old carnival district," the handler droned, unaware that Marcus had already begun his work. <words>81</words> Behind the handler, Marcus tracked subtle distortions in an antique funhouse mirror mounted on the wall, reading the warped reflections like tea leaves. <words>104</words> Each ripple revealed surveillance patterns, guard rotations, the architecture of a system built on blood. <words>119</words>

Marcus moved with artfully clumsy precision, dropping his coffee cup to mask the sound of his fingers typing secondary commands. <words>140</words> His grandmother had taught him this ancient art of misdirection before the occupation, when magicians still performed in theaters instead of smuggling medical supplies. <words>164</words> The bead clicked against his keyboard—morse code to his network of fellow vigilantes listening through compromised frequencies. <words>181</words>

"You're doing important work," his handler continued to flatter, oblivious that Marcus had already traced his location through the mirror's telltale warping of electromagnetic fields. <words>206</words> The handler was three blocks from the detention center where Marcus's sister had vanished. <words>221</words>

The screaming silence between his handler's words told Marcus everything: how many had died for this intelligence, how many more would die if he completed his assigned mission. <words>250</words> The waiting area's broken speakers hummed with phantom announcements of flights that would never arrive, destinations that no longer existed. <words>271</words>

Marcus shifted the laptop camera slightly, letting it catch the bead's surface. <words>283</words> To his handler, it appeared accidental, but his team recognized the signal. <words>296</words> Tonight, they would strike the real target—not the refugee safe house his handler had marked for elimination, but the command center hidden beneath the handler's own building. <words>324</words>

"Confirmed," Marcus finally spoke, his subdued voice betraying nothing of the rage that had transformed him from history professor to vigilante. <words>345</words> The funhouse mirror continued its ancient dance of truth and distortion, showing Marcus how his grandmother's gentle hands had become his own scarred fists. <words>369</words>

The war had taken everything sacred and made it tactical. <words>379</words> Even prayer beads became communication devices, even mirrors became intelligence assets, even clumsiness became strategy. <words>393</words> As the call ended, Marcus pocketed the bead and disappeared into the terminal's shadows, another ghost haunting the ruins of what peace used to mean. <words>418</words>

Tomorrow, his handler would understand the price of war. <words>427</words> Tonight, Marcus would ensure someone finally paid it. <words>436</words>
