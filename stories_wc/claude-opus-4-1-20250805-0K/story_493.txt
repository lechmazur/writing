Sir Aldric descended the subway stairs beneath Knossos Station, where the ancient Minoan palace had been converted into the city's central transit hub centuries ago. <words>24</words> The prudent knight clutched a manila envelope, its contents secured by nothing more than a loose binder ring that caught fluorescent light with each step. <words>49</words> Around him, evening commuters rushed past frescoed walls depicting bull-leapers and dolphins, their phones glowing where oil lamps once burned. <words>69</words>

He had discovered the letters in his late grandmother's apartment, bundled carelessly in a shoebox marked "Return to Sender." <words>88</words> Each envelope bore different handwriting but identical postmarks from this station, dated across forty years. <words>103</words> The messages themselves seemed mundane—grocery lists, weather observations, birthday wishes—yet Aldric noticed cryptic patterns in secondhand letters, where certain words appeared too frequently to be coincidence. <words>129</words>

"Blood," "throne," "labyrinth," "return." <words>133</words>

His grandmother had been mysteriously cheerful about her past, deflecting questions with laughter that never reached her eyes. <words>151</words> She claimed to be an orphan, but these letters suggested otherwise. <words>162</words> The loose binder ring had held them in deliberate order; when Aldric rearranged them chronologically, the highlighted words formed coordinates. <words>182</words>

Platform Seven, Column Twelve, Third Tile. <words>188</words>

He found it between a coffee kiosk and a newsstand, where ancient stone met modern marble. <words>204</words> Kneeling, he pressed the tile with his mailed glove. <words>213</words> It shifted, revealing a narrow compartment containing a bronze seal bearing the labrys—the double axe of Minoan royalty. <words>231</words>

"You understand," said a voice behind him. <words>238</words>

An elderly woman stood there, wearing a janitor's uniform but carrying herself like nobility. <words>252</words> Her eyes matched his grandmother's exactly. <words>258</words>

"She protected you by keeping our family's guarded secrets," the woman continued. <words>270</words> "The last descendants of King Minos have survived by hiding in plain sight, serving as guardians of this place." <words>289</words> She gestured to the bustling station. <words>295</words> "We maintained the palace by transforming it, preserving what matters while adapting to survive." <words>309</words>

Aldric examined the seal, its weight both foreign and familiar in his palm. <words>322</words> His unknown ancestry suddenly crystallized—not mere nobility, but an unbroken line of protectors. <words>335</words> His grandmother's cheerfulness hadn't been mysterious; it was the satisfaction of duty fulfilled, secrets successfully guarded. <words>351</words>

"Every evening, one of us rides these trains," his great-aunt explained, "watching over commuters who traverse our ancestors' halls without knowing." <words>373</words> She handed him a janitor's badge. <words>379</words> "Your knight's training prepared you for battles, but this guardianship requires different armor." <words>392</words>

The familiar unknown surrounded him—his heritage hidden within modernity, ancient purposes served through contemporary means. <words>407</words> Aldric pocketed the seal and badge, understanding finally that some kingdoms endure not through conquest but through careful transformation. <words>426</words> The loose binder ring had held more than letters; it had bound generations of patient watchers, and now included him. <words>446</words>
