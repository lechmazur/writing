The summoner's fingers traced lazy circles around the rustic coffee grinder, its worn brass catching the phosphorescent glow of the shared dream recording studio. <words>19</words> Mira had been enthusiastically lazy about her craft since the last breath of the dying god three months ago—that final exhalation had stolen something essential from the world's magic. <words>48</words>

"The coral won't rebuild itself," her assistant reminded her, voice echoing through the studio's crystalline walls where thousands of recorded dreams pulsed like trapped fireflies. <words>73</words>

Mira yawned, grinding coffee beans with deliberate slowness. <words>81</words> "The river told me something yesterday," she said, her apathy a practiced shield against the weight of responsibility. <words>99</words> "It said wisdom unfolds like morning—you can't rush it, only prepare for its arrival." <words>114</words>

The assistant gestured toward the deserted hall beyond the studio, where seven empty frames hung in perfect alignment, their hollow centers waiting for the summoned spirits that would channel the ocean's healing force. <words>146</words> "You've been preparing for weeks." <words>151</words>

"Enthusiastically," Mira corrected, pouring hot water over the grounds with exaggerated care. <words>163</words> The aroma mingled with the studio's perpetual scent of lavender and static electricity. <words>176</words> She had discovered that her particular brand of energetic indifference created the perfect frequency for dream recording—too much effort and the dreams scattered; too little and they never materialized. <words>205</words>

She drifted toward the frames, coffee in hand. <words>213</words> Each frame had been salvaged from the god's final temple, their wood still humming with residual divinity. <words>230</words> "The river's wisdom," she continued, pressing her palm against the first frame, "is that everything dead becomes foundation for something living." <words>251</words>

The frame flickered. <words>254</words>

One by one, with movements both languid and precise, she matched each frame to a recorded dream from the studio's archives—dreams of coral polyps building cities, of fish painting reefs with their scales, of water itself remembering how to nurture. <words>295</words> Her summoning was different now, gentler but sharper, like a blade wrapped in silk. <words>309</words>

Through the frames, spirits began to unfold—not the violent eruptions of her previous summonings, but a gradual blooming, each one carrying blueprints of coral encoded in pure intention. <words>337</words> They moved with her same enthusiastic laziness, understanding that resurrection required patience masquerading as indifference. <words>352</words>

"The god's last breath wasn't an ending," Mira murmured, watching the spirits flow toward the distant ocean through the studio's dream-channels. <words>373</words> "It was permission to stop trying so hard." <words>381</words>

The coffee grinder sat empty now, its purpose fulfilled—not to grind beans, but to remind her that some transformations require circular motions, repetitive patience, and the wisdom to appear careless while caring deeply. <words>414</words> The coral reefs would rebuild, one lazy afternoon at a time. <words>425</words>
