The solitary summoner stood at the quantum beach's edge, where probability waves collapsed into sand that existed and didn't exist simultaneously. <words>20</words> In her weathered palm lay a map drawn on a leaf—oddly authentic despite its impossible cartography, showing paths through dimensions her family had traced for generations. <words>45</words> Today was Dissolution Day, the holiday her bloodline celebrated by gathering at condemned buildings in their final moments, channeling the structure's dying energy to fuel their otherworldly craft. <words>73</words> 

She prowled the shoreline, her feet leaving impressions that flickered between presence and absence, searching for the perfect vantage point. <words>93</words> The abandoned observatory loomed behind her, its walls trembling with pre-demolition charges, counting down to obliteration in the hush that precedes all endings. <words>117</words> Her reflection shimmered in the quantum tide pools—a thousand versions of herself, each more accomplished, more powerful than she'd ever been. <words>138</words> 

To outshine your own reflection was the summoner's curse, the perpetual hunger that drove her kind to reach across realities. <words>158</words> The leaf-map pulsed with bioluminescent veins, revealing the constellation of moments where invention sparked into being—those precious instances when imagination breached the membrane between possible and real. <words>185</words> Her grandmother had drawn this map with her dying breath, inscribing quantum coordinates with sap that still smelled of autumn rot and promise. <words>209</words>

The building's final seconds approached, and she felt the corroded rapture rising—that exquisite decay of joy that came from touching something beautiful as it died. <words>234</words> Her family's tradition demanded she capture the spark of invention that escaped when human structures surrendered to entropy, that bright flash of what-could-have-been released in destruction. <words>260</words> 

She began the summoning, her voice harmonizing with the quantum beach's impossible frequencies. <words>273</words> The sand beneath her formed fractal patterns, each grain a tiny mirror reflecting not light but potential. <words>290</words> As the first explosion bloomed behind her, she pulled—not with her hands but with her will—drawing forth the building's accumulated dreams: every blueprint never drafted, every renovation never undertaken, every life never lived within its walls. <words>328</words>

The spark materialized, hovering between her palms like a newborn star, oddly authentic in its rawness. <words>344</words> Her reflections in the tide pools flickered and dimmed, finally surpassed by this singular moment of creation-through-destruction. <words>361</words> The leaf-map crumbled to dust, its purpose fulfilled, as she absorbed the spark into her chest where it would gestate until the next Dissolution Day. <words>387</words> 

Tomorrow she would prowl another quantum shore, seeking another ending to transform into beginning, forever chasing the corroded rapture of outlasting her infinite selves. <words>411</words> But tonight, she was the only version of herself that mattered, standing alone where possibility met extinction, triumphant in her solitary summoning. <words>434</words>
