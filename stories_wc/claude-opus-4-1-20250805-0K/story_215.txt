Father Marcus clutched the vintage postcard between trembling fingers, its faded image of the old psychiatric hospital mocking him through the observation glass of the psychic research facility. <words>24</words> The entity he'd failed to banish last week had somehow synthesized itself into the facility's quantum consciousness experiment, and now Dr. Chen wanted answers he couldn't give. <words>50</words>

"Your bio-readings spike whenever you look at it," she noted, her tone dripping with coy aggression as she circled him like a predator. <words>73</words> "For someone who claims to bridge faith and empiricism, you're remarkably... guarded." <words>85</words>

The waltz music from the adjacent recreation room filtered through the walls—Tuesday's mandatory dance lessons for the research subjects, a peculiar protocol designed to synchronize brain waves. <words>112</words> Marcus forced himself to appear relaxed, though inwardly his social instincts screamed to confess everything, to warn them about what he'd accidentally unleashed. <words>135</words>

"The postcard arrived three days after your last visit," Dr. Chen continued, tapping her tablet. <words>151</words> "No postmark, no fingerprints, just this image and a sequence of numbers on the back." <words>167</words>

Marcus knew those numbers. <words>171</words> They were biblical verses he'd recited during the failed exorcism, now rearranged into coordinates pointing deeper into the facility. <words>191</words> The entity was playing with them, leading them somewhere specific. <words>201</words>

"I need access to your restricted basement," he said finally, each word a calculated disclosure. <words>217</words> "The entity isn't just haunting your equipment—it's trying to show us something about the intersection of consciousness and the divine." <words>238</words>

Dr. Chen's eyes glittered with dangerous curiosity. <words>245</words> "The basement requires solving our security puzzles, Father." <words>253</words> "Seven logic problems based on Jung's collective unconscious theories." <words>262</words> "Even our own researchers rarely pass." <words>268</words>

"Then test me," Marcus challenged, knowing the entity had already whispered the solutions during his nightmares. <words>284</words> "Unless you prefer to continue this dance of half-truths while that thing grows stronger." <words>299</words>

Two hours later, as the waltz lessons reached their crescendo upstairs, Marcus input the final solution. <words>316</words> The hidden room unsealed with a pneumatic hiss, revealing walls covered in equations that perfectly synthesized quantum mechanics with medieval demonology. <words>338</words> At the center sat a journal—Dr. Chen's predecessor had been conducting the same experiments, trying to entwine science with wonder, before vanishing without explanation. <words>363</words>

"He summoned it first," Marcus whispered, understanding flooding through him. <words>373</words> "Your entire facility was built to contain what he accidentally discovered." <words>384</words>

Dr. Chen's façade finally cracked, revealing genuine fear. <words>392</words> "Can you stop it?" <words>396</words>

Marcus pocketed the postcard, feeling its edges burn with otherworldly heat. <words>407</words> "Not stop," he admitted, his rattled confidence slowly rebuilding. <words>416</words> "But perhaps we can finally finish what your predecessor started—together." <words>426</words>

The lights flickered as the entity agreed, ready to reveal its true purpose. <words>439</words>

Above them, the dance lessons ended in perfect, unsettling synchronization. <words>449</words>
