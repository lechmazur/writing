Marina's fingers traced the simple drawer knob she'd stolen thirty years ago, its brass surface worn smooth by guilt. <words>17</words> The prismatic lake behind the half-built amphitheater shifted from emerald to sapphire as clouds passed overhead, but the joyless performer saw only gray. <words>40</words>

She'd come here to organize her confession, to finally tell someone about the child she'd accidentally pushed from the playground seesaw that autumn morning. <words>64</words> The girl had survived, but Marina had run, and the lie had calcified inside her chest, turning every subsequent performance into a hollow pantomime. <words>88</words>

The construction site was deserted this Sunday, steel beams reaching skyward like accusatory fingers. <words>102</words> Marina had chosen this place deliberately—the new venue where she'd been invited to perform next season, an honor she knew she didn't deserve. <words>126</words>

She walked past cement mixers and scaffolding to the overlooking hill where remnants of the old playground remained. <words>144</words> The seesaw was still there, rust-eaten but functional, and when the wind caught it, the squeak echoed across the water exactly as it had that day. <words>171</words>

Marina sat on one end, the drawer knob heavy in her pocket. <words>183</words> She'd taken it from the girl's music box while visiting the hospital, a stupid, panicked theft that made no sense except as self-punishment. <words>207</words> Her life since had been modestly extravagant—comfortable success without joy, applause without warmth, beauty without meaning. <words>224</words>

The seesaw's rhythm hypnotized her, and she found herself speaking aloud to the lake. <words>238</words> "I pushed her because she was better than me." <words>247</words> The truth felt both liberating and inadequate. <words>254</words> "No—I pushed her because I was afraid she was better." <words>264</words> Still not right. <words>267</words> "I pushed her by accident while trying to show off, and then I let everyone think she just fell." <words>286</words>

Each version was true, but none was complete. <words>294</words>

She stood with cautious abandon, pulled out her phone, and found the woman's social media profile—Sarah Chen, now a successful violinist. <words>316</words> Marina had checked it obsessively for years, watching her thrive despite the childhood injury that ended her dance dreams. <words>335</words>

The message she typed was simple: "I was the girl on the other side of the seesaw. <words>352</words> I have something of yours to return. <words>359</words> And an apology thirty years overdue." <words>365</words>

She attached a photo of the drawer knob against the prismatic lake, then sent it before her courage dissolved. <words>384</words>

The construction site would become a place for performances, but Marina had already given hers—an audience of one, herself, finally organizing the chaos of her guilt into something she could live with. <words>417</words> The seesaw continued its lonely song as she walked back toward her car, lighter but not yet free. <words>435</words>
