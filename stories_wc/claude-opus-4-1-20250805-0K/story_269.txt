The nostalgic tailor pressed his weathered palm against the dusty mirror mounted on the steampunk observation deck's brass wall, watching lightning fracture the sky beyond the porthole windows. <words>28</words> After the last code is broken, they'd told him, the barriers between parallel lives dissolve like thread in acid. <words>47</words> He'd spent forty years stitching garments for the elite who frequented this airship station, but only yesterday had he deciphered the final sequence etched into the mirror's tarnished frame. <words>76</words>

"I've seen myself die seventeen times," he confessed to his reflection, his voice barely audible above the storm's percussion. <words>95</words> The confession felt improbable even to him, yet storms had always loosened truths from his lips like buttons from worn fabric. <words>116</words> In the mirror, his other selves moved independently now: one younger, still apprenticing; another crowned in strange metals; a third dissolving into geometric patterns that hurt to perceive. <words>144</words>

"Don't be afraid," he whispered, trying to reassure the version of himself that looked most terrified. <words>160</words> That one wore the same thimble-scarred fingers but had never learned the craft, had chosen differently at every crucial seam. <words>180</words> The tailor's breath fogged the glass as another confession escaped: "I killed a man once, in the life where I became a surgeon instead." <words>204</words>

The observation deck shuddered as the storm intensified, and through the mirror's surface, something subtly menacing began to emerge. <words>223</words> Not quite shadow, not quite flesh, it was the amalgamation of all his parallel selves reaching through, their fingers interlacing with his. <words>246</words> Each touch brought memories that weren't his: victories unearned, loves unknown, deaths uncounted. <words>259</words>

"This is how we ascend beyond mortal limits," he said, his voice now a chorus. <words>275</words> The other passengers had long since fled the deck, leaving him alone with his infinite reflections and the terrible promise they offered. <words>298</words> To become all versions of oneself simultaneously was to transcend death itself, but the price was everything that made him singular. <words>320</words>

His fingers found the brass needle he'd hidden in his vest pocket, the one he'd used to stitch the final symbol that broke the code. <words>345</words> "I was meant to mend things," he confessed to the storm, to himself, to the void between worlds. <words>364</words> With hopeful desperation burning in his chest, he pressed forward into the mirror's surface, feeling it yield like silk. <words>383</words> The glass parted, accepting him into the space between parallel lives where tailors became gods, stitching reality with threads of possibility. <words>405</words> Behind him, the dusty mirror cracked, sealing the passage forever. <words>415</words>
