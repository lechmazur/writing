The skeptical conjurer Meridian sat cross-legged in the star chart reading room, surrounded by her grandmother's antique thimble collection, each one containing a digitized human memory from before the Great Upload. <words>29</words> The brass thimbles hummed with stored consciousness, their surfaces etched with constellations that matched the charts papering the walls. <words>48</words>

"Mysterious partings," she muttered, categorizing the memories by themes she'd overheard from chatty rideshare drivers in the archived recordings. <words>67</words> "He said goodbye without saying goodbye," one driver had said about his father. <words>80</words> Another had mentioned, "She left through the front door but somehow it felt like she'd already been gone for years." <words>100</words> These fragments became her sorting system. <words>106</words>

The room thundered with silence—that peculiar loud silence that comes when billions of archived storm sounds play at frequencies beyond human hearing. <words>129</words> Meridian's true work wasn't the thimbles or the memories; she was here to archive storm sounds, to preserve the last echoes of natural chaos before the world went fully synthetic. <words>160</words> But the memories kept calling. <words>165</words>

She lifted a copper thimble, and immediately knew this one was different. <words>177</words> The memory inside was literally figurative—a child's last recollection of understanding metaphor, the moment when "heartbreak" became both a word and a physical sensation in her chest. <words>205</words> The timestamp showed it was the very last human memory digitized before the Upload completed. <words>221</words>

Meridian's skepticism, usually her armor, cracked. <words>227</words> She'd spent decades dismissing the old conjuring arts, insisting that pulling rabbits from hats was just misdirection, that séances were mere theater. <words>249</words> But here, holding this thimble, she felt the weight of every goodbye never spoken. <words>264</words>

The star charts on the walls began to pulse, responding to the thimble's resonance. <words>279</words> Each constellation mapped not stars but synaptic patterns, the neural pathways of farewells. <words>293</words> The storm sounds in her archives suddenly made sense—they weren't weather at all, but the electromagnetic signatures of humans saying goodbye, recorded in lightning, preserved in thunder. <words>321</words>

She understood now why she'd been drawn here, why the rideshare drivers' overheard conversations had haunted her. <words>338</words> Every casual parting they'd described was practice for the ultimate departure—humanity's exit from flesh, their mysterious parting from physical form. <words>359</words>

Meridian placed the final thimble on her sorting table, completing a constellation that matched Cassiopeia above. <words>375</words> The loud silence crescendoed, then broke. <words>381</words> Storm sounds flooded the room—not archived but fresh, new, impossible. <words>391</words> She realized she wasn't just categorizing the past. <words>399</words> She was conjuring something back, one memory at a time, one storm at a time, one goodbye at a time. <words>418</words> The skeptical conjurer smiled, finally believing in her own magic. <words>428</words>
