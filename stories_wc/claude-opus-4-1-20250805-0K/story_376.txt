The rogue fortune teller Astrid bent over her amber inkwell, its honeyed depths catching firelight from the whale-oil lamps adorning the reimagined longhouse walls. <words>20</words> Through the hush of an overlooked era—when Vikings had ceased their raids but before Christianity fully claimed the North—she practiced her peculiar art. <words>41</words> Unlike her grandmother's dramatic prophesies, Astrid wore modestly flashy robes: deep burgundy wool trimmed with just enough silver thread to command respect without spectacle. <words>65</words>

She had broken from the völva tradition years ago, choosing instead to archive emotional patterns in her precious amber ink. <words>85</words> Each client's reading became a permanent record, their hearts' zigzag paths between love and loss captured in golden script. <words>104</words> The longhouse, once built for war councils, now housed shelves of her leather-bound chronicles, each spine marked with runic dates. <words>125</words>

Tonight, Jarl Magnus entered without announcement. <words>131</words> His presence filled the space with unspoken offer—she could smell it like iron before rain. <words>147</words> He carried two horn cups and a wineskin, knowing her weakness. <words>158</words>

"I've brought that Frankish vintage you mentioned," he said, pouring carefully. <words>169</words> Their shared love for wine tasting had begun innocently enough, comparing notes on Saxon ales versus Mediterranean grapes during his trading voyages. <words>191</words> But Astrid understood the currency of silence; some transactions required no words. <words>203</words>

She sipped slowly, maintaining fierce repose despite recognizing the wine's value—worth more than three horses. <words>218</words> "You want me to stop recording your wife's visits," she stated. <words>229</words>

Magnus's jaw tightened. <words>232</words> "She comes seeking prophecies about my death." <words>239</words>

"She comes seeking patterns in her own grief," Astrid corrected, dipping her bone stylus into the amber inkwell. <words>256</words> "Your marriage died long before you will." <words>263</words>

The truth hung between them like suspended honey. <words>271</words> Astrid had documented three years of the Jarl's wife's sessions, each revealing another layer of abandonment, another emotional scar from Magnus's increasing absences. <words>294</words>

"What would you have me do?" <words>300</words> Astrid asked, her stylus poised. <words>305</words> "Burn her records? <words>308</words> Pretend her pain doesn't deserve witnessing?" <words>314</words>

Magnus poured more wine, his hand trembling slightly. <words>322</words> "I would have you understand that some patterns shouldn't be preserved." <words>333</words>

Astrid set down her stylus and reached for her cup instead. <words>344</words> In this moment, she realized her true purpose wasn't just archiving emotions but teaching the powerful to witness them. <words>363</words> She raised her wine toward the Jarl. <words>370</words>

"Your offer is declined," she said with quiet authority. <words>379</words> "But stay. <words>381</words> Drink. <words>382</words> Let me show you what your wife actually seeks." <words>391</words>

She opened a leather volume, its amber-inked pages glowing in the lamplight. <words>403</words> Magnus leaned forward, finally ready to read the emotional archaeology of his own failed love, preserved forever in golden script. <words>423</words>

Outside, snow began to fall on the forgotten settlement, blanketing their choices in temporary silence. <words>438</words>

The amber inkwell sat between them, patient as time itself. <words>449</words>
