Before the first creature developed sentience, when the universe still dreamed in patterns rather than thoughts, there existed a listless noble named Aurelius who wandered the endless corn maze stretching across a haunted plain. <words>30</words> He wore a faded scarf that had once belonged to his mother, its threads containing memories from when time itself was young. <words>50</words> 

Aurelius possessed a naively sophisticated understanding of existence—he could recite the mathematical poetry of stellar formations yet believed butterflies were merely flowers learning to fly. <words>75</words> His days dissolved into one another like watercolors in rain, each indistinguishable from the last, until an unexpected invitation materialized in the morning dew. <words>99</words>

"Rendezvous at the maze's heart," the droplets spelled, "where intention births reality." <words>111</words>

How delightfully absurd, he mused, that water should summon him to discover the power of intention in a world where nothing yet intended anything. <words>135</words> The corn stalks, taller than mountains, whispered secrets in languages that wouldn't exist for eons. <words>150</words> Their rustling formed a symphony of pre-consciousness, a melody that made Aurelius simultaneously want to weep and laugh. <words>168</words>

At the maze's center, he found not a person but a phenomenon—a swirling vortex of possibility where the laws of physics played dice with themselves. <words>193</words> The vortex spoke without words, communicated without meaning, and somehow Aurelius understood perfectly. <words>206</words>

"You seek intention in a universe of accidents," it hummed. <words>216</words> "How wonderfully backwards." <words>219</words>

Aurelius wrapped his faded scarf tighter, its worn fabric the only solid thing in this liquid reality. <words>236</words> "Perhaps," he replied, "intention is simply accident wearing formal clothes." <words>246</words>

The vortex rippled with what could only be described as shared laughter—not the sound but the essence of mirth itself, raw and unformed. <words>270</words> It was the first laugh that would echo through time, inspiring joy in creatures not yet imagined. <words>287</words> Aurelius found himself laughing too, his listlessness evaporating like morning fog. <words>297</words>

Together, they discovered that intention wasn't about purpose or planning—it was about the cosmic joke of existence choosing to exist at all. <words>320</words> The haunted plain trembled with their revelation, corn stalks bowing in ironic reverence to this profound absurdity. <words>337</words>

As dawn approached (though suns hadn't learned to rise yet), Aurelius understood his wandering had always been intentional—a search for meaning in meaninglessness, sophistication in simplicity. <words>363</words> His mother's scarf fluttered like a flag of surrender to the beautiful chaos. <words>376</words>

The vortex gifted him one final wisdom: "When sentience arrives, it will think itself special. <words>391</words> But you and I know better—we've shared the universe's first inside joke." <words>403</words>

Aurelius smiled, no longer listless but purposefully purposeless, walking back through the endless maze with the confidence of someone who finally understood the punchline. <words>427</words>
