Marwen had tended the particle acceleration garden for three centuries, long enough to watch the Council paint over history with their sanitized versions of truth. <words>24</words> She laughed bitterly, remembering when this place grew actual fruit instead of breeding quantum orchards that fed nothing but corporate profits. <words>44</words> Her fingers, rigidly flexible from decades of pruning both matter and antimatter branches, clutched the single earbud cover she'd found yesterday. <words>65</words> It belonged to the last true botanist who'd worked here before the Great Conversion, when they'd destroyed Earth's last natural ecosystem. <words>87</words>

During her morning sketching session, Marwen knocked over her ink pot deliberately. <words>99</words> The spill spread across her diagram of the garden's particle streams, forming ephemeral patterns that only her borderline immortal eyes could interpret. <words>121</words> "Show me," she whispered to the dancing molecules, and they did—revealing the hidden seed vault buried beneath sublayer seven. <words>141</words> Another bitter laugh escaped her lips as she realized the Council's greatest oversight: they'd painted over history so thoroughly, they'd forgotten what they'd buried. <words>166</words>

The earbud cover wasn't just debris; it was a key, its polymer shell encoded with the botanist's final research. <words>186</words> Marwen pressed it against the garden's central accelerator, watching as its molecular structure began to resonate. <words>202</words> The ink patterns had shown her the truth—this wasn't just a garden, but a launcher, designed to scatter seeds across dimensional barriers. <words>226</words> "You beautiful, paranoid bastard," she chuckled darkly at the botanist's memory. <words>237</words> He'd known the Council would destroy everything, so he'd hidden Earth's entire genetic library in quantum states, waiting for someone rigidly flexible enough to bend the rules without breaking them. <words>268</words>

Her sketching continued as she recalibrated the accelerator, each line pulling more truth from the painted-over past. <words>284</words> The particles began their dance, faster and faster, while Marwen's bitter laughter echoed through the sterile chamber. <words>301</words> She'd lived too long to believe in justice, but revenge tasted sweet enough. <words>315</words> The launch sequence initiated as the final ink pattern revealed itself—a map of virgin worlds where these seeds would take root. <words>337</words>

The Council would wake tomorrow to find their prized garden empty, its particles scattered across a thousand timelines. <words>355</words> Each seed carried within it the memory of what Earth had been before the painting over began. <words>373</words> Marwen dropped the earbud cover into the accelerator's heart, watching it dissolve into probability waves. <words>388</words> Her work here was done; the broken ecosystem would restore itself, one quantum leap at a time. <words>406</words> She sketched one last pattern in the remaining ink: a tree bearing impossible fruit, roots reaching through dimensions. <words>424</words> "Let them try to paint over this," she said, her laughter finally free of bitterness as the garden began to bloom backwards through time. <words>449</words>
