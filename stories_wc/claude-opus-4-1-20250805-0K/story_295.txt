The sellsword Grimwald burst through the witch's herb garden gate, his laughter echoing off moonflowers that glowed like fallen stars. <words>16</words> "Madam Thessaly!" he bellowed, trampling past rows of whispering mandrake. <words>26</words> "I've come to break the withering vow!" <words>33</words>

The witch emerged from between towering stalks of thornmallow, her silver hair writhing like smoke. <words>48</words> "Boldly reluctant as always," she mused, noting how his hand trembled even as his voice boomed. <words>64</words> "You doubt yourself still." <words>68</words>

"Doubt sits on my mind's throne like a tyrant," Grimwald admitted, his jovial mask cracking. <words>83</words> "But my family's tradition demands I treasure what matters most." <words>93</words> He produced an ornate astronomical telescope, its brass surface etched with constellations. <words>105</words> "Every generation, we bury a time capsule containing our greatest treasure beneath the new moon." <words>120</words> 

"And you chose that?" <words>124</words> Thessaly's eyes glittered dangerously. <words>128</words>

"My grandfather used it to map the heavens before the withering vow stole his sight." <words>143</words> Grimwald's fingers traced the delicate engravings. <words>149</words> "The vow passes through bloodlines—each descendant loses what they love most unless they surrender their treasure to earth and flame." <words>169</words>

Throughout the transformation that followed, the garden erupted in elegant mayhem. <words>179</words> Thessaly's herbs twisted skyward, their roots bursting from soil in spirals of emerald light. <words>193</words> The telescope began to sing—a crystalline note that shattered nearby windows into rainbow dust. <words>207</words> Grimwald stood at the epicenter, laughing through his terror as the vow's magic clawed at his bones. <words>224</words>

"You must choose!" <words>227</words> Thessaly shouted over the supernatural tempest. <words>233</words> "Bury it and keep your sight, or keep it and go blind!" <words>245</words>

But Grimwald, magnificent in his contradiction, split the telescope's lens with his sword. <words>257</words> "I choose neither!" <words>260</words> Half he buried deep beneath the screaming sage; half he held aloft like a beacon. <words>275</words> The garden convulsed—flowers bloomed and died in seconds, seasons cycling madly through the witch's domain. <words>290</words>

The vow, finding no complete surrender nor complete defiance, began unraveling like a poorly-woven spell. <words>305</words> Magic pooled around Grimwald's boots, thick as honey, sweet as revenge. <words>316</words> His grandfather's curse lifted not through submission but through audacious innovation. <words>327</words>

When dawn broke, the garden lay in gorgeous ruins—herbs rearranged in impossible patterns, spelling out astronomical equations in living green. <words>347</words> Grimwald sat among the devastation, polishing the remaining half of the telescope, his eyes clear and bright. <words>364</words>

"Doubt dethroned at last?" <words>368</words> Thessaly asked, offering him tea brewed from comet-tail herbs. <words>377</words>

"Replaced with glorious uncertainty," he grinned, raising the cup in a toast. <words>389</words> "My descendants will inherit half a telescope and a better tradition—the courage to break the rules we're given." <words>407</words>

The witch smiled, watching him stride away through her ruined garden, whistling. <words>419</words> Some treasures, she knew, were meant to be broken. <words>428</words>
