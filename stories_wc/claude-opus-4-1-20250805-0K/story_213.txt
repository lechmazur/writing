The photosynthesis research lab had been converted into a wedding venue, its gleaming equipment pushed against walls now draped with fairy lights. <words>18</words> Dr. Marina Chen stood at her assigned post near the oxygen monitors, a dutiful sentinel even amid the celebration, watching the experimental plants that couldn't be moved. <words>44</words> She twisted the basic plastic hair clip holding back her laboratory-regulation ponytail, a nervous habit that had worn the cheap blue plastic smooth. <words>67</words>

The bride was her sister, marrying into a family of restaurateurs who had transformed the sterile space into something delightfully strange—a shared table stretched between centrifuges and microscopes, laden with fusion cuisine that somehow worked. <words>102</words> The wedding toasts had begun, each speaker telling stories about love, about transformation, about new beginnings. <words>118</words>

Marina knew what was coming. <words>123</words> In twelve minutes, the modified chloroplasts in Tank Seven would reach critical mass. <words>136</words> The stories being told now—about ordinary love, ordinary futures—would seem quaint after tonight. <words>150</words> She had tried to warn them, tried to explain that her work on artificial photosynthesis had achieved something unprecedented, but they thought she was jealous, delusional, desperate for attention at her sister's wedding. <words>183</words>

"To Sarah and Marcus!" someone shouted, raising champagne. <words>191</words>

Marina checked her watch. <words>195</words> Ten minutes. <words>197</words> The enzyme cascade would begin soon, and with it, the production of oxygen at rates that would make Earth's atmosphere irrelevant. <words>218</words> Humanity could live anywhere, breathe anywhere, if they could just understand. <words>229</words> But they preferred their small stories, their comfortable myths about what was possible. <words>243</words>

She moved toward Tank Seven, past the dessert table where her grandmother was telling the story of how she'd fled across borders with nothing but hope. <words>269</words> That story had shaped their family, made them believe in impossible dawns. <words>281</words> Marina understood now why she had to destroy the tank. <words>291</words>

Not to prevent the transformation—that was inevitable—but to control its narrative. <words>302</words> If it happened during a wedding toast, during a moment of pure storytelling, the two would be forever linked in human memory. <words>324</words> The story of humanity's next evolution would begin not in a laboratory accident or corporate boardroom, but at a celebration of union. <words>346</words>

She gripped the hair clip tighter, its sharp edge cutting into her palm. <words>359</words> Five minutes. <words>361</words> Her uncle was standing now, telling a story about sunrise over the Mediterranean, about believing in tomorrow. <words>378</words>

Marina smiled, something primal and sophisticated in her expression. <words>387</words> She opened the tank's release valve. <words>393</words> The room filled with shimmering green light, with air so pure it made everyone gasp, then laugh, then understand. <words>412</words> The stories would change now. <words>417</words> The sunrise she'd ushered in was finally here, witnessed by those who'd never believed, transformed into myth before their eyes. <words>437</words> Her sister caught her eye across the glowing room and raised her glass. <words>450</words> To new beginnings. <words>453</words> To impossible dawns. <words>456</words> To stories that reshape the world. <words>462</words>
