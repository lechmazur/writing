The falcon circled twice before landing on Margot's outstretched arm, its message tube empty. [14] She studied the bird's ruffled feathers through the outpost window, noting how frost had formed asymmetric patterns on its wings. [31] "So much for aerial reconnaissance," she muttered, setting the bird on its perch. [44]

Outside, the frozen lake stretched like a cataract eye, its surface scarred by pressure ridges that converged toward a single point near the horizon. [68] Margot returned to her makeshift desk where topographical charts covered every inch of rusted metal surface. [84] For three months she'd been stationed here, editing the Commonwealth's new atlas while secretly pursuing her own obsession: finding the source rivers that fed this ancient lake before the Great Freeze. [114]

The outpost groaned against the wind, a sound she'd grown to find oddly comforting. [129] Everything here possessed that same worrying tranquility—the kind that preceded avalanches or the breaking of ice shelves. [147] She picked up the phrasebook she'd discovered in the supply cache, its pages dog-eared at seemingly random intervals. [166] The previous occupant had been a polyglot, according to the station log, who'd disappeared while following what he called "the singular convergence." [189]

Margot traced her finger along the dog-eared pages, finding words in seven languages for "source," "beginning," "genesis." [207] The pattern wasn't random at all. [213] She held the book up to the window where her breath had created condensation on the glass. [230] The moisture formed rivulets that ran downward, branching and merging in a dendritic pattern that perfectly matched the theoretical watershed she'd been mapping. [254]

"Well, that's almost too convenient," she said to the falcon, her dry wit a shield against the revelation's implications. [274] But her hands moved with subtly confident precision as she overlaid the condensation pattern onto her charts. [291] The convergence point aligned exactly with the pressure ridges on the lake. [303]

She'd been looking at it backwards. [310] The rivers didn't feed the lake—they began beneath it, trapped under miles of ice, flowing outward through subterranean channels. [330] The polyglot's marginalia suddenly made sense: each dog-eared page marked a location where local dialects had preserved ancient words for "upwelling" or "emergence." [355]

The falcon ruffled its feathers, a herald's gesture she'd learned to interpret. [368] Company was coming. [371] Through the frosted window, she spotted a figure approaching across the lake, following the exact path her condensation map had revealed. [392] The person moved with purpose, carrying what looked like drilling equipment. [403]

Margot quickly rolled up her charts, tucking the phrasebook into her parka. [415] The Commonwealth had sent her here to map what was, but she'd discovered what had been—and what might be again. [435] The figure was close enough now that she could see the official insignia on their thermal suit. [452] An inspector, probably, come to check on her progress with the atlas. [464]

She opened the door before they could knock, greeting them with practiced nonchalance. [478] "Terrible weather for a social call," she said. [486] "Coffee?" [487]

The inspector removed their mask, revealing weathered features and knowing eyes. [498] "I'm looking for the previous resident's research," they said. [507] "A polyglot named Marcus. [511] He was my brother." [515]

Margot's hand instinctively moved to the phrasebook in her pocket. [525] "He left very little behind," she said carefully. [533] "Just standard equipment and some old language texts." [541]

The inspector studied her face, then looked at the condensation patterns on the window. [555] "He believed the rivers would return," they said quietly. [564] "That underneath all this ice, they're still flowing, waiting for their chance to herald spring again." [581]

The falcon cried once, sharp and clear. [589] Margot made a decision that would change everything—or nothing, depending on one's perspective about convergence points and the patience of buried water. [612] She pulled out the phrasebook, opening it to the page marked with the word for "trust" in a dialect that hadn't been spoken for fifty years. [638]

"Your brother found something," she said, her voice carrying the subtly confident tone of someone who'd solved an impossible equation. [658] "And if you're willing to risk everything on the word of a dry-witted atlas editor, I can show you where the rivers begin." [682]

The inspector smiled, and the worrying tranquility of the outpost suddenly felt like the held breath before a first spring thaw. [704] Together, they spread the charts across the rusted desk, the polyglot's phrasebook between them like a rosetta stone for reading the language of ice and time and patient water. [736] Outside, the frozen lake waited, keeping its secrets just a little while longer. [750]
