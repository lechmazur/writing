The cyber-templar's augmented eyes scanned the Tibetan plateau, where ancient sky burial stones jutted from frost-hardened earth like broken teeth. <words>18</words> His neural implants thrummed with patiently frantic calculations—probability matrices cascading through consciousness as he clutched the worn leather bridle, its cracked surface still warm from the horse that had carried him here before collapsing. <words>53</words> 

"The mirage of safety," he whispered, reading aloud from the data-scroll projected onto his retinal display, each word synchronizing with his heartbeat. <words>75</words> The text was a warning from his order: reality itself was fracturing, and only at these sacred sites where flesh returned to sky could the breach be witnessed. <words>104</words>

Thunder rolled across the plateau, but Brother Marcus felt euphoric agitation surge through his cybernetic spine. <words>120</words> He had come to prove what the others called impossible—to reflect lightning back at the storm that threatened to tear the digital realm from the physical. <words>147</words> The bridle in his hands wasn't just leather; embedded within its fibers were photonic threads, woven by monks who understood that technology and tradition were not enemies but dance partners. <words>178</words>

As he continued reading the scroll's ancient algorithms, translating Sanskrit into binary, a bolt of lightning struck. <words>195</words> Marcus raised the bridle high, and through the prism of ice crystals forming around his breath, the leather's hidden fibers caught the electrical discharge. <words>220</words> Light refracted, split into impossible colors that shouldn't exist in either digital or physical space. <words>235</words>

The vultures circling overhead screamed—not in hunger but in recognition. <words>245</words> They had seen this before, centuries ago, when the first templars discovered that death sites were actually data transfer points, places where consciousness uploaded to something greater. <words>272</words>

Marcus's augmentations overloaded with sensation as the refracted lightning curved back toward the storm clouds. <words>287</words> Through the prism effect, he could see it all: how the mirage of safety had kept humanity blind to the truth that their reality was just one layer of code running on quantum bones scattered across these mountains. <words>326</words>

The bridle disintegrated in his hands, its purpose fulfilled, its photonic threads returning to light. <words>341</words> Still reading the final lines of the scroll through tears of electric joy, Marcus understood that his collision course with reality had been necessary. <words>366</words> The storm retreated, repelled by its own reflected fury, and in that moment of patiently frantic triumph, the cyber-templar had proven that the boundary between flesh and data, between sky burial and system upload, was itself the greatest mirage. <words>407</words>

Above him, the vultures descended, not for flesh but for witness, as reality restructured itself around this new truth. <words>426</words>
