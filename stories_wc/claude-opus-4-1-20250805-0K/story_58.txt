The moth observation tower stood against the darkening sky like a prayer candle, its windows glowing faintly as the city's lights flickered below. <words>19</words>

Marcus, the colony's most fiercely loyal scout, pressed his palm against the engraved bullet journal cover—a gift from his grandmother before the world changed. <words>44</words>

"Balance the storms inside," she'd written on the first page, her handwriting shaky but determined. <words>59</words>

Now, as the unexpected outage rippled through the grid, he understood why the elders had sent him here. <words>77</words>

The moths gathered in impossible patterns against the glass, drawn by the tower's emergency lighting—individually common creatures forming something extraordinary. <words>97</words>

Below, in the observation deck's amphitheater, the Keeper performed her nightly routine. <words>109</words>

"Why did the moth go to therapy?" she asked the empty seats, her voice carrying that peculiar weight of sanctified dread. <words>130</words>

"Because it was drawn to the light but afraid of getting burned!" <words>142</words>

Marcus scribbled in his journal, recognizing the pattern. <words>150</words>

Each joke contained fragments—coordinates, frequencies, meditation mantras hidden in the punchlines. <words>161</words>

The Keeper's comedy wasn't entertainment; it was instruction, designed to radicalize those who could decode the nonsense. <words>178</words>

"The moths know," she continued, gesturing at the swirling cloud outside. <words>189</words>

"They understand that darkness isn't the opposite of illumination—it's the canvas." <words>200</words>

Another flicker. <words>202</words>

The city's heartbeat stuttered, and Marcus felt his own internal storms rising—the anxiety, the doubt, the weight of his loyalty to people who might already be gone. <words>230</words>

He forced himself to breathe, to write, to decode. <words>239</words>

"Knock knock," the Keeper said. <words>244</words>

"Who's there?" Marcus whispered, playing along though she couldn't hear him. <words>255</words>

"Inner." <words>256</words>

"Inner who?" <words>258</words>

"Inner peace requires outer chaos to define its borders." <words>267</words>

The meditation technique crystallized in his mind—not despite the comedy, but through it. <words>280</words>

The moths suddenly scattered, forming a mandala against the tower's glass dome. <words>292</words>

Marcus understood: the outage wasn't accidental. <words>298</words>

Someone had orchestrated this moment, this gathering, this lesson. <words>307</words>

His journal filled with notes—breathing patterns hidden in setup-punchline rhythms, visualization exercises coded in moth flight descriptions, mantras buried in the Keeper's theatrical sighs. <words>331</words>

The lights stuttered back, weaker than before. <words>338</words>

Time was running out. <words>342</words>

The colony needed scouts who could navigate both external dangers and internal chaos. <words>355</words>

The Keeper looked up, directly at Marcus's hidden position, and winked. <words>366</words>

"Final joke of the night," she announced. <words>373</words>

"How do you meditate during an apocalypse?" <words>380</words>

She paused, letting the sanctified dread fill the space. <words>389</words>

"One breath at a time, one heartbeat at a time, one bad joke at a time." <words>405</words>

Marcus closed his journal, understanding complete. <words>411</words>

Tomorrow, he would return to the colony, transformed. <words>419</words>

Tonight, he would sit with the moths and practice what he'd learned, balancing his inside storms while the city's lights danced their uncertain dance below. <words>444</words>
