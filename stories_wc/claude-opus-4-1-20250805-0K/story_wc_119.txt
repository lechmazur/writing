The lighthouse keeper's tavern closed at midnight, but Chen Li remained at his corner table, arranging fortune slips like sheet music across the scarred wood. [23] Through salt-stained windows, the lighthouse beam swept across black waters, illuminating nothing and everything. [37] 

For twenty years, Chen had written fortunes for the Golden Dragon restaurant chain, each message precisely calibrated to sound profound while meaning nothing. [59] But here on Skeleton Rock, where mainland smugglers and intelligence officers pretended not to recognize each other over watered whiskey, his fortunes had developed an uncomfortable habit of coming true. [91]

"You write things before they happen," the bartender had observed last week, sliding Chen another glass of plum wine. [110] "That's dangerous in a place where everyone's hiding something everyone already knows." [123]

Chen understood the paradox perfectly. [128] The island thrived on open secrets—every visitor knew the lighthouse contained more than navigational equipment, every fisherman could identify which boats carried contraband instead of cod, every fortune cookie from the single Chinese restaurant doubled as a dead drop for messages no one officially sent. [171]

Tonight, Chen orchestrated something different. [176]

He withdrew the microdot reader from his jacket, a device that looked like vintage reading glasses but could magnify film specs down to molecular level. [201] The CIA had given it to him years ago, back when they thought he was their asset rather than everyone's and no one's simultaneously. [225] Through the lenses, his fortune slips revealed their true purpose: musical notation, each character a note, each message a measure in a composition only he could hear. [253]

The lighthouse beam swept past again. [259] Three seconds, darkness, three seconds, light—a rhythm he'd been unconsciously matching in his writing for months. [276]

Earlier that evening, before last orders, the Bulgarian chess master had opened his fortune: "Your next move already echoes in tomorrow's memory." [299] The man had laughed, but Chen watched him pale when he realized his planned defection—the one he'd discussed with no one—was somehow already known. [326] Not through surveillance or betrayal, but through Chen's peculiar gift for writing futures that insisted on becoming present. [345]

Chen arranged another slip, directing the flow of information like water through carefully placed stones. [360] Each fortune would reach its intended reader tomorrow, carried by the island's elaborate pantomime of coincidence. [377] The harbormaster's wife would find hers in a cookie meant for the customs officer. [391] The customs officer would accidentally receive the Soviet botanist's message. [402] The botanist would discover words intended for the lighthouse keeper himself. [413]

But tonight, Chen wrote his own fortune: "The composer becomes his own music." [427]

He'd been transposing lives for others long enough, shifting their melodies from major to minor, allegro to andante. [445] His fortunes had orchestrated defections, prevented assassinations, sparked love affairs between enemies—all while maintaining the fiction that fortune cookies contained nothing more than vague pleasantries. [473]

The lighthouse beam caught him standing. [479] Through the microdot specs, he could see the real message embedded in the light itself—morse code so slow it took hours to complete a single word. [507] Tonight's word: "TRANSCEND." [510]

Chen smiled at the familiar enigma of his situation. [519] He'd spent years hiding truth in plain sight, writing prophecies that created their own fulfillment, conducting an orchestra where every musician pretended they couldn't hear the music. [546] The island's open secrets had become his symphony, each resident a note he'd learned to play. [563]

He left his fortunes on the table for the morning staff to distribute, each one accidentally prophetic, deliberately vague, perfectly precise. [584] The Bulgarian would defect successfully. [589] The harbormaster's wife would discover her husband's smuggling. [597] The customs officer would finally understand why no one ever left Skeleton Rock unchanged. [611]

As Chen walked toward the lighthouse, the beam swept over him one last time. [625] Tomorrow, they'd find his reading glasses on the rocks, the microdot specs that saw too much. [641] They'd find fortune slips scattered by wind, each one blank except for musical notation. [656] They'd realize their cryptic fortune cookie writer had been orchestrating more than their futures—he'd been composing his own disappearance, one prophetic message at a time. [683]

The lighthouse door stood open, as it always had for those ready to transpose their lives into new keys. [703] Chen stepped through, finally understanding that the greatest open secret was that everyone on Skeleton Rock was writing their own fortune. [726] He'd simply been the only one honest enough to admit it. [738]
