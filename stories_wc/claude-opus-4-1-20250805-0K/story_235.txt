The ancient castle had been transformed into an art academy, its stone walls now hosting weekly classes where students learned traditional techniques. <words>19</words> Yuki, the remote herbalist who lived in the mountain's shadow, attended only to teach pressed flower preservation every Tuesday evening. <words>38</words> She carried the same weathered book each time, its pages holding specimens collected across decades, each flower marking a moment when her path had crossed with another's. <words>65</words>

Among her students sat Kenji, a meteorologist who spent his nights tracking ephemeral meteor showers from the castle's highest tower. <words>85</words> Neither acknowledged that forty years ago, they had been lovers who parted without explanation, their fates seemingly severed by silence. <words>105</words>

Throughout the art classes, Yuki would reposition her pressed flower book with calculated precision, opening to specific pages that only Kenji would recognize. <words>129</words> The purple iris from Mount Fuji's base where they first kissed. <words>141</words> The cherry blossom from the tree under which he had proposed. <words>153</words> The chrysanthemum from her grandmother's funeral, where he hadn't appeared. <words>163</words>

What the other students perceived as random teaching examples were dramatically subtle messages, a language written in petals and time. <words>183</words> Kenji understood this unspoken conversation she was provoking, responding in his own way by sharing his meteor observations during break times. <words>205</words>

"The Perseids peaked last night," he would mention casually, though Yuki knew he was decoding patterns in those celestial moments, finding meaning in their trajectories. <words>230</words> Each shower carried messages about timing, about cycles, about things that appear to burn away but leave invisible traces. <words>250</words>

Week after week, this distant intimacy continued, two people occupying the same room yet separated by decades of chosen solitude. <words>270</words> The pressed flowers told stories of paths taken and untaken; the meteor data spoke of cosmic timing and missed alignments. <words>290</words>

One evening, Yuki deliberately dropped her book, its pages falling open to reveal a blank space, dated but empty. <words>310</words> Kenji recognized the date immediately: tomorrow would mark forty years since their separation. <words>323</words> After class, he left a note on her desk with coordinates and a time: the pre-dawn hour when tomorrow's meteor shower would peak. <words>347</words>

She arrived at the castle tower to find him waiting with two telescopes positioned side by side. <words>364</words> Without words, they watched the sky together, understanding that some fates remain intertwined even across silence, distance, and time. <words>384</words> As meteors traced their brief paths overhead, Yuki pulled a fresh flower from her pocket, pressing it between empty pages while Kenji recorded the shower's pattern, their parallel gestures finally converging into shared meaning. <words>418</words> The castle walls, ancient witnesses to countless stories, held their reconnection with the same patient stones that had held their separation. <words>440</words>
