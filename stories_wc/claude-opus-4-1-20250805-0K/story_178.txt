Marcus, an overburdened clerk at the Mariana Research Station's undersea greenhouse, sorted through supply manifests while coral polyps swayed beyond the reinforced glass. <words>24</words> The greenhouse sat on a coral plateau three hundred meters down, where genetically modified plants grew in pressurized chambers, their roots searching for cures to surface plagues. <words>50</words> His wife lay dying above, her lungs crystallizing from the new pandemic, while he catalogued seeds and pH levels with methodical precision. <words>72</words> 

Last Tuesday's trivia night at the station's cramped recreation pod had changed everything. <words>85</words> Dr. Chen, the quantum physicist, had mentioned her grandmother's vintage stamp collection—specifically, the misprinted 1957 series depicting impossible botanical specimens. <words>105</words> "The plants exist," she'd whispered over synthetic beer, "but not in our dimensional frequency." <words>120</words>

Marcus had laughed then, but desperation makes believers of skeptics. <words>130</words> Now he held those stamps, borrowed from Chen's quarters, their perforated edges trembling in his gloved hands. <words>147</words> Each stamp showed flora that shouldn't exist: roses with crystalline thorns, algae that spiraled through mathematical impossibilities. <words>164</words> Chen's equations covered his workstation—formulas to quantize reality itself, to lock consciousness into discrete dimensional states like tuning a radio between stations. <words>187</words>

The greenhouse hummed with recycled air as Marcus pressed the first stamp against the observation portal. <words>203</words> Time became absolutely relative; what lasted an eternity occupied only the ephemeral pause of a breath. <words>219</words> The stamp's image flickered, and suddenly Marcus was weaving between worlds, his consciousness threading through parallel greenhouses where different evolutionary paths had spawned different cures. <words>244</words>

In one reality, the coral plateau hosted fungal colonies that secreted antibodies. <words>256</words> In another, the modified plants had already solved the crystallization plague through symbiosis with deep-sea bacteria. <words>272</words> Marcus reached through dimensional membranes, his clerk's mind cataloguing each cure's molecular structure with the same precision he'd once applied to inventory sheets. <words>295</words>

The dissonant calm of existing in multiple states simultaneously should have driven him mad. <words>309</words> Instead, he felt oddly peaceful, even as his body remained frozen in that single breath while his consciousness gathered healing knowledge from infinite greenhouses. <words>333</words> Each stamp in the collection opened another door, another possibility, another world where his wife might live. <words>350</words>

When he finally exhaled, releasing the quantum state, Marcus held the formula in his mind like a perfectly organized filing system. <words>371</words> The cure existed not in one world but in the spaces between them, assembled from fragments across realities. <words>389</words> He began mixing compounds with steady hands, the overburdened clerk who had learned to carry the weight of infinite worlds in the pause between breaths. <words>414</words> Outside, the coral plateau glowed with bioluminescent promise, unaware it had just hosted humanity's salvation. <words>429</words>
