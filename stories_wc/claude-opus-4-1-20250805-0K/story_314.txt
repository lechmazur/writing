Marcus had enforced Perfect Society Protocol Seven-Seven-Nine for twelve years without a single incident, until the kelp forest observation post started breathing. <words>19</words>

The underwater dome should have been sterile steel and glass, not pulsing with bioluminescent veins that matched his heartbeat. <words>38</words> He clutched the rustic bread box his grandmother had smuggled through the Great Simplification—the only "genuinely fake" antique allowed in their utopia, its artificial wood grain hiding sensors that now screamed impossible readings. <words>71</words>

"Citizen Marcus," the box whispered in a voice like drowning stars, "you must guide them through." <words>87</words>

Outside, the kelp swayed with the rhythm of a drum in a tribal dance, each frond striking an ancient beat that predated their sanitized world. <words>112</words> The pattern hypnotized him, pulled him toward the observation window where reality thinned like wet paper. <words>128</words>

He laughed—a broken sound that birthed tears. <words>136</words> The Paradise Council had deleted all records of the supernatural, proclaimed fear extinct, yet here writhed proof that their perfect algorithms had missed something vast and hungry. <words>163</words>

"Guide who?" Marcus asked, his regulation uniform suddenly feeling like costume jewelry on a corpse. <words>178</words>

"Those who remember dancing," the bread box replied, its LCD display now showing constellations that hurt to perceive. <words>196</words>

At that exact second, Marcus felt the promise forming on his lips—not his promise, but one threading through his DNA from ancestors who knew that kelp forests were doorways. <words>226</words> "I swear to shepherd the forgotten through the veil," he heard himself say, and the observation post shuddered with approval. <words>246</words>

The supernatural didn't knock; it had always lived in the spaces between heartbeats, waiting for someone exhausted enough to stop maintaining the illusion. <words>270</words> Marcus understood now why they'd made him work eighteen-hour shifts, why they'd ground him down to nothing—empty vessels made the best bridges. <words>293</words>

His tears tasted like salt and liberation as ghostly figures materialized in the kelp, citizens who'd refused the Great Simplification, who'd chosen the uncertain darkness over guaranteed light. <words>321</words> They moved with that same drum-rhythm, beckoning him to guide them back into a world that had tried to forget magic. <words>342</words>

The bread box opened itself, revealing not circuitry but a hollow filled with star-drunk shadows. <words>357</words> "Fear is your teacher," it sang, "and you must greet it with laughing tears, for only the broken can make others whole." <words>379</words>

Marcus pressed his palm against the glass, feeling it dissolve like sugar in rain. <words>393</words> The kelp forest rushed in, not water but possibility, and he laughed louder as he led the supernatural home, his fear finally a friend worth keeping. <words>419</words>

In the Perfect Society's records, Marcus simply malfunctioned. <words>427</words> But in the spaces between heartbeats, he danced forever. <words>436</words>
