The obsidian skyscraper housed the city's most peculiar hospital, where Dr. Marina Chen worked the quiet shift before sunrise, her pleasant meddling disguised as routine rounds. <words>24</words> She carried a pair of rusted ice skates—her grandmother's—believing they held the key to decoding ancient symbols etched into their blades. <words>44</words> Marina was openly manipulative about her true purpose here; she'd convinced the board that studying sleep patterns would revolutionize medicine, when really she needed access to comatose patients' dreams. <words>73</words>

The symbols on the skates matched those appearing in her patients' EEG readings during deep REM sleep. <words>90</words> Each night, she scattered seeds of suggestion into their unconscious minds through carefully calibrated sound frequencies, hoping to harvest meaning from their responses. <words>114</words> The process would weaken their dream barriers temporarily, allowing ancient memories—collective unconscious patterns—to surface like receding footprints of a nighttime beach wanderer, visible only until the next wave. <words>142</words>

"Pleasant dreams, Mr. Torres," she whispered, adjusting his IV drip with practiced fingers while her other hand traced the corroded symbols on the skate blade. <words>167</words> The monitors flickered, displaying patterns that shouldn't exist in modern neuroscience. <words>178</words> She recognized them immediately: the same spiraling forms her grandmother had obsessively sketched before disappearing forty years ago, leaving only these skates behind. <words>201</words>

Marina's lucid confusion grew as the symbols began translating themselves through her patients' neural responses. <words>217</words> Each mind processed them differently—Mr. Torres saw mathematical equations, while Mrs. Liu in the next room experienced them as musical notes. <words>239</words> The scattered seeds of her experiment were growing into something unexpected: not individual interpretations, but pieces of a larger message that required multiple consciousness to decode. <words>266</words>

She moved between rooms in the pre-dawn darkness, the obsidian walls reflecting nothing, absorbing everything. <words>282</words> Her manipulation felt justified now—these people were unknowing translators of something ancient and vital. <words>297</words> The ice skates grew warm in her hands as more symbols illuminated on the monitors, each patient's contribution weakening the veil between past and present. <words>323</words>

By 5:47 AM, the message cohered: coordinates, not to a place but to a moment—the exact time her grandmother had vanished. <words>345</words> Marina understood with crystalline clarity that the skates weren't just artifacts; they were receivers, and the hospital's obsidian structure was an amplifier. <words>369</words> The scattered seeds weren't her suggestions at all, but memories trying to take root, searching for the right minds to remember what had been deliberately forgotten. <words>397</words>

As sunrise approached, Marina made her choice, sliding her feet into the rusted skates, knowing they would carry her wherever—whenever—her grandmother had gone. <words>421</words> The pleasant meddler had become the meddled with, her patients' dreams the true architects of her destiny. <words>439</words> The footprints on that distant beach had always been walking toward her. <words>451</words>
