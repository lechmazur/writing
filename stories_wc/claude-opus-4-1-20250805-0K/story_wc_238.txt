The sheet music archive beneath St. Marguerite's Cathedral held more than compositions—it housed the whispers of unfinished symphonies and the ghosts who hummed them. [23] Vera Blackwood descended the stone steps, her column deadline forgotten, drawn by an email from someone she'd exorcised badly five years ago. [43]

"Think of possession like water finding cracks," she'd written in last week's society pages, between updates on the Mayor's haunted gala. [64] "Sometimes the vessel needs to stay broken to let the light through." [76] Her readers loved her metaphors, never knowing she meant them literally. [87]

The archive smelled of yellowed paper and something sweeter—bergamot and old roses. [99] Marcus stood between towering shelves of bound scores, holding an antique perfume bottle that glowed faintly green. [116] Above them, she could hear the chainsaws warming up; the cathedral's historic orchard would be gone by noon, making way for parking. [139]

"You came," Marcus said, his voice carrying the slight echo that marked the possessed. [154] But this wasn't the violent thrashing she'd banished from him before. [165] This was different—controlled, almost harmonious. [170]

"Your message said you'd found a way to reconnect without losing yourself," Vera said, approaching carefully. [187] The perfume bottle pulsed brighter. [192] "That's impossible. [194] I've been doing this for fifteen years—" [201]

"You've been ripping spirits out like weeds," Marcus interrupted, and she heard both his voice and another's, a woman's, threading through his words. [225] "Never considering that some roots run deeper than damage." [234]

He uncorked the bottle, and the scent intensified—not just perfume but memory itself, distilled. [248] The ghost sharing Marcus's body materialized partially, a translucent woman in a 1920s evening dress. [264] "My grandmother," Marcus explained. [268] "The composer Elisabetta Romano. [272] She died before finishing her masterwork." [278]

Vera's throat tightened. [281] Five years ago, she'd torn Elisabetta from Marcus like removing a tumor, brutal and complete. [296] She'd written about it triumphantly: "Local Man Freed from Parasitic Spirit." [307] She hadn't known they were family. [313] Hadn't asked. [315]

"The perfume was hers," Marcus continued, holding it toward the musical scores. [327] "She wore it while composing. [333] The scent creates a current between her world and ours—not possession but collaboration." [346] Sheet music began fluttering without wind, notes rearranging themselves on the pages. [357]

"I'm sorry," Vera said, the words scraping her throat raw. [368] "I saw an invasion where there was an invitation. [377] I should have listened—" [381]

"Apologies are just words floating in air," Elisabetta's voice came through Marcus, but gently. [395] "Like notes without rhythm. [399] What matters is the next movement." [405]

Above them, the first tree fell with a crack that shook dust from the archive ceiling. [421] The hush before destruction was over. [427] Vera understood suddenly why they'd chosen this moment—the orchard's death would scatter the old energies that kept spirits tethered to this place. [449] After today, Elisabetta couldn't return. [454]

"Help us finish it," Marcus said, gesturing to the scattered compositions. [465] "Her requiem for the trees. [470] She always meant to complete it before they were cut." [479]

Vera had destroyed their first collaboration with her exorcism, her need to categorize everything as either possession or freedom. [499] Now she saw the third option—imperfect miracles, the kind where ghosts and grandsons shared breath and memory, where damage became a door. [522]

She took the perfume bottle, dabbing it on her wrists. [532] The scent carried her into the current between worlds, where Elisabetta's memories flowed like music. [547] Together, they began gathering the scattered pages, Marcus humming his grandmother's melodies while Vera transcribed the notes that appeared in the perfumed air. [570]

"Think of it like a dance," Vera murmured, finding her metaphor at last. [583] "Sometimes leading means learning to follow." [589]

The requiem took shape as the orchard died above them, each fallen tree adding urgency to their work. [607] When the last note was written, Elisabetta's form solidified just enough to kiss her grandson's forehead before dissolving into the scent of roses and bergamot. [633]

Marcus corked the empty bottle, no longer glowing. [641] "She's gone," he said, but without grief. [648] "The music remains." [651]

Vera would write about this in tomorrow's column, between gossip about the Archbishop's tea scandal. [666] She'd tell the story slant, in metaphors her readers might finally understand: Sometimes the most profound exorcisms invite the ghosts to finish their work before they leave. [694] Sometimes reconnection requires breaking apart first. [700] Sometimes apologies arrive as sheet music, written in a dead woman's perfume. [712]
