Marcus polished the same glass for the third hour, his movements droning on in mechanical rhythm while twilight customers flickered between the abandoned carnival ticket booth's warped windows. <words>27</words> The gloomy barkeep had converted the booth into a makeshift bar where transient realities overlapped, serving drinks to travelers who existed only partially in any single world. <words>53</words> His abrasively charming manner—equal parts insult and invitation—kept the desperate and curious returning, though none stayed longer than their reality permitted. <words>75</words>

"Your wallet's showing again," Marcus growled at the translucent figure nursing whiskey, pointing at the worn leather bleeding through dimensions. <words>95</words> The patron tucked it away with embarrassment that transcended worlds. <words>105</words>

Outside, the broken payphone booth crackled with static confessions from other timelines—lovers' promises, murderers' guilt, children's wishes—all bleeding through the damaged receiver that dangled like a hanged man. <words>133</words> Marcus had learned to decode these fragments, understanding that each confession marked another reality's attempt to reclaim the light stolen by midnight. <words>155</words> Every night at twelve, darkness consumed something precious from each world: memories, colors, hopes. <words>170</words>

The booth existed in perpetual dusk, that precious hush when a truce forms without words between day and night, between what was and what might be. <words>197</words> Here, enemies shared drinks without recognition, and lovers passed without knowing they'd searched lifetimes for each other. <words>215</words>

Marcus understood his role as keeper of this threshold. <words>224</words> His worn wallet, inherited from the previous barkeep, contained not money but tickets—carnival tickets that could transport bearers between realities for exactly one drink's duration. <words>249</words> He dispensed them sparingly, only to those whose overheard confessions at the payphone revealed genuine need. <words>265</words>

Tonight felt different. <words>268</words> The droning wasn't just his repetitive polishing but something deeper—reality itself groaning under accumulated midnight thefts. <words>284</words> A woman materialized, solid unlike the others, her eyes holding the enigmatic familiarity of someone who'd existed in every reality simultaneously. <words>305</words>

"You know why I'm here," she said, placing an identical worn wallet on the bar. <words>321</words>

Marcus nodded, understanding flooding through him like whiskey burn. <words>330</words> She was the first barkeep, the one who'd discovered how to reclaim what midnight stole. <words>346</words> The price was becoming guardian of the threshold, serving drinks to reality's refugees until another came to take your place. <words>367</words>

He slid his wallet across the bar, accepting the cosmic transaction. <words>378</words> The booth shuddered, reality reshuffling like dealt cards. <words>386</words> Marcus felt himself solidifying, becoming real again, while she began to fade into the role he'd inhabited. <words>403</words>

"The confessions will teach you everything," she whispered, already beginning her eternal polishing as Marcus walked toward dawn's reclaimed light. <words>423</words> Behind him, the carnival booth hummed with its strange hospitality, waiting for the next lost soul seeking what midnight had taken. <words>445</words> The payphone crackled once—a child's laughter from tomorrow—and Marcus didn't look back. <words>458</words>
