The orchard island drifted through the maelstrom with unnatural grace, its apple trees blooming despite the chaos of swirling waters below. <words>18</words> Midwife Elara stood at the stone fireplace, her fingers blackened from sifting through ash and char. <words>34</words> The half-burned diaries she'd discovered there whispered truths that everyone on the island pretended not to know. <words>52</words> 

She was openly secretive about her work—displaying her pressed herbs in glass frames along the cottage walls while never explaining their true purpose. <words>76</words> Each specimen held a memory someone had surrendered during childbirth, when pain made the mind pliable. <words>92</words> The island's elders had taught her this practice, though they claimed to have forgotten it themselves. <words>108</words>

Under the waxing moon's glow, Elara spread the salvaged diary pages across her table. <words>122</words> The entries belonged to previous midwives, each one critical of their predecessors yet blind to their own transgressions. <words>140</words> "We harvest what they cannot hold," one had written. <words>149</words> "The memories of transition, of becoming, of first breaths—these feed the trees." <words>161</words>

The apple orchard was no accident. <words>167</words> Each tree grew from seeds nourished by stolen memories, their fruit sweet with forgotten joys and bitter with lost sorrows. <words>187</words> The island itself fed on these offerings, maintaining its impossible existence in the eye of perpetual storm. <words>204</words>

Elara crushed vervain between her palms, its sharp scent cutting through the smoke-thick air. <words>218</words> She had delivered forty-seven babies on this island, and with each birth, she had grown more critical of the practice. <words>238</words> Growing wisdom meant understanding that some traditions deserved destruction. <words>247</words>

The diaries revealed the method: pressed herbs mixed with ash, consumed under moonlight, could return what was taken. <words>265</words> But transcending the island's hold required more than recipes. <words>274</words> It demanded she acknowledge her own complicity while maintaining the dissonant calm necessary to continue her work. <words>291</words>

She prepared the mixture methodically, adding lavender she'd pressed the day she arrived, rosemary from her first delivery, sage from the night she'd understood. <words>315</words> The other midwives would call her critical, ungrateful, dangerous. <words>324</words> They were right. <words>327</words>

As she drank the bitter tea, memories flooded back—not just her own, but fragments of every mother she'd attended. <words>347</words> The orchard began to wither, its stolen sustenance returning to its sources. <words>359</words> The maelstrom's eye widened, offering passage. <words>365</words>

Elara packed her remaining pressed herbs carefully. <words>372</words> Tomorrow, she would deliver the island's last baby, and with that final birth, she would ensure no memories were stolen. <words>392</words> The growing wisdom of generations would transcend this parasitic tradition. <words>401</words> She would be the critical midwife who ended what should never have begun. <words>414</words>

The waxing moon watched as she burned the remaining diary pages, their smoke carrying the last secrets away. <words>432</words>
