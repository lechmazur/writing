The terra-cotta grotto glowed amber beneath the energy beings' pulsing light, their arrival three nights ago having changed everything about how shadows worked. [22] Marcus, who'd been composing verses along Highway 61 for seven years, pressed his palm against the ancient clay walls, feeling vibrations that shouldn't exist. [44] In his other hand, he clutched the frayed rope he'd found that morning—hemp still bearing the oils from desperate hands, its fibers telling their own violent poem of escape. [73]

"Show me another layer," he whispered to the luminous presence hovering near the grotto's mouth. [88] The being rippled, and suddenly Marcus could see through the wall to where previous visitors had carved their names across centuries, each signature existing simultaneously. [111] Time had texture here, rough like the rope's weave, smooth like worn clay, sharp like the moral edges he'd been dancing along since finding the escaped convict's tool. [140]

He'd already patterned out the truth: the rope belonged to Samuel Reeves, wrongly imprisoned for his brother's crime, who'd fled through this very grotto seventy-three years ago. [168] The energy beings had shown him this first layer yesterday, playing their ethically complex game of revelation. [185] But Marcus suspected deeper truths waited beneath, and his poet's hunger for complete understanding wouldn't let him sleep. [204]

The rope trembled in his grip as another layer peeled back. [215] Now he saw Samuel's brother, Thomas, standing in this same spot in 1955, weeping as he buried evidence of his guilt in the terra-cotta floor. [241] The energy being pulsed brighter, amused by Marcus's sharp intake of breath. [254] They fed on moral complexity, these creatures, savoring impossible choices like wine. [266]

"Pattern it forward," Marcus commanded, his voice passionate but controlled. [276] The being complied, showing him Samuel's daughter discovering the truth in 1987, holding this same rope, deciding whether to expose her uncle or preserve her father's hard-won freedom. [306] She'd chosen silence, but the choice had carved hollows in her soul that Marcus could somehow taste in the grotto's recycled air. [329]

Each revelation stripped away another veil from time's substance. [338] Marcus ran his fingers along the rope's fraying edge, understanding now why the energy beings had led him here. [357] They needed someone who could hold all these contradictory truths simultaneously, someone whose roadside poetry had already taught him that justice and mercy were often impossible to reconcile. [385]

The final layer revealed itself without prompting. [392] Thomas Reeves had become a judge, had spent forty years releasing the wrongly accused, trying to balance cosmic scales that could never be balanced. [416] His last act before death was leaving this rope in a place where someday, someone would find it and understand. [437]

Marcus began to laugh, soft and wondering. [444] The energy being spiraled closer, drinking in his recognition of the eternal joke. [457] Every choice created ripples that became other impossible choices, texture upon texture, until time itself was nothing but the interweaving of consequences. [481]

He set the rope down gently in its original position, knowing someone else would need to find it someday. [501] The grotto's terra-cotta walls began to sing—or perhaps they'd always been singing and he only now could hear it. [522] The energy beings had come to Earth seeking poets who could perceive time's true nature, its terrible beautiful complexity. [542]

Walking back toward the highway, Marcus composed verses in his head about the weight of secrets, the inheritance of choices, the way starlight looked different now that he understood it had witnessed every layer of every story simultaneously. [579] Behind him, the rope waited in its patient coil, ready to teach its next student about the impossible mathematics of human morality. [601] The energy beings followed at a distance, their satisfaction humming through dimensions that yesterday he couldn't have imagined. [619] Tomorrow he would write it all down, but tonight he simply walked, carrying time's texture in his bones, finally understanding why the universe needed its drifting poets. [646] They were the only ones foolish enough to look at impossible choices and find them beautiful. [662] Under the ancient starlight, Marcus smiled, knowing he'd discovered exactly what he'd been seeking all those years on the road. [683] The texture of time was nothing more, and nothing less, than the accumulated weight of every heart that had ever broken itself trying to choose correctly. [710]
