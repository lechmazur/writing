Sir Aldric crossed the ruined aqueduct, its broken arches casting shadows across the desert sand between the mountain passes. <words>17</words> The earnest knight carried an astronomical map rolled beneath his arm, parchment worn from years of searching. <words>33</words> His homeland lay frozen beyond the northern peaks, waiting for the ancient fires that once warmed its valleys. <words>51</words> 

The greenhouse appeared like a mirage where the aqueduct ended, glass panels shattered and frame tilting against time. <words>69</words> Something unknowingly familiar pulled him forward—perhaps the way sunlight fractured through the broken roof, or how sand had claimed the foundation. <words>90</words> Inside, desert winds had sculpted dunes around rusted planters where nothing had grown for decades. <words>105</words>

Aldric unrolled his map beneath the torn ceiling, comparing constellations to the pattern of holes above. <words>121</words> His grandmother had spoken of this place in bedtime stories, though he'd never realized until now. <words>137</words> The greenhouse of the Star-Tender, she'd called it, where life's canvas stretched between earth and sky. <words>153</words>

By mapping tears in the roof of a rundown greenhouse, aligning each gap with stars on his chart, Aldric discovered what generations had missed. <words>177</words> The holes weren't random destruction but deliberate apertures, each positioned to capture specific celestial light. <words>192</words> When noon approached, beams converged on a sand-covered medallion embedded in the floor's center. <words>206</words>

He brushed away the grit with trembling fingers, revealing an inscription: "From ice comes yearning, from stars comes remembering." <words>225</words> The words triggered something deep—his grandmother's voice, her weathered hands tracing these same symbols in flour dust while baking. <words>244</words> She'd been here, learned this truth, passed it down in fragments he was only now assembling. <words>260</words>

The medallion turned with surprising ease, and beneath lay seeds preserved in crystal chambers. <words>274</words> Not ordinary seeds, but ember-blooms his people thought extinct—flowers that generated warmth through their roots, enough to thaw frozen soil. <words>294</words> The Star-Tender had saved them here, in this intersection of desert and mountain, preserving hope. <words>309</words>

Aldric carefully gathered the seeds, understanding flooding through him like dawn breaking. <words>320</words> The canvas of life wasn't meant to be blank or complete, but constantly painted by those who dared to search. <words>340</words> His grandmother had planted the stories; he would plant the seeds. <words>351</words>

As he departed through the greenhouse door, the aqueduct's shadows stretched longer, pointing toward home. <words>366</words> The astronomical map had led him here, but memory would guide him back. <words>379</words> Behind him, the greenhouse stood sentinel in the desert, keeping its vigil between the mountain passes. <words>395</words> Soon, flames would dance again in the land of ice, sparked by seeds that had waited lifetimes for an earnest knight to remember what was never truly forgotten. <words>423</words>
