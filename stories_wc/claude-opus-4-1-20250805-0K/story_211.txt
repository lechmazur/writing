Marcus "Lucky" Chen had won everything except what mattered, so he clutched his grandmother's botanical diary as he entered the abandoned schoolhouse where reality bent like old floorboards. <words>23</words>

In the hush of the unremembered future—that strange epoch where memories dissolved before forming—the ghost town of Prosperity had become a sanctuary for those who typically never surrendered to fate. <words>53</words>

The diary's pressed flowers whispered of a time when power grew naturally from soil, not from the synthetic victories that now corrupted every lucky streak Marcus touched. <words>81</words>

Inside the schoolhouse, seven chairs circled an ancient bottle that spun eternally on its axis, waiting for players brave enough to confess their way to redemption. <words>108</words>

"Welcome, Lucky," laughed the Keeper, her voice bright with cheerful despair—that peculiar emotion of those who danced while drowning. <words>127</words>

"You've come to duplicate yourself?" <words>132</words>

Marcus nodded, understanding the game's cruel elegance: through spin-the-bottle confessions, players could create copies of themselves from moments before power's corruption took hold. <words>155</words>

The first spin landed on him immediately—luck's curse following him even here. <words>168</words>

"I confess," Marcus began, his voice cracking like drought-touched earth, "that I cheated time itself at the Crystal Casino, winning decades from other players' lives." <words>194</words>

The bottle glowed, and across from him materialized a younger Marcus, eyes still innocent of victory's weight. <words>211</words>

Six more spins, six more confessions: the mayor he'd ruined with a perfect hand, the fortune teller whose gifts he'd stolen with loaded dice, the children whose futures he'd gambled away for eternal luck. <words>245</words>

Each confession birthed another duplicate, earlier versions of himself sitting in judgment. <words>257</words>

The botanical diary fell open, revealing his grandmother's final entry: "Power grows like kudzu, beautiful until it strangles everything it was meant to protect." <words>281</words>

His youngest duplicate, barely eighteen, picked up the diary with reverent hands. <words>293</words>

"We could all go back," the boy suggested, hope cutting through the cheerful despair like sunlight through dusty windows. <words>312</words>

"We could tend gardens instead of odds." <words>319</words>

But Marcus knew the truth—in this unremembered future, only one version could exist. <words>333</words>

The others would fade like pressed flowers, beautiful ghosts of possibility. <words>344</words>

Yet seeing himself uncorrupted, Marcus felt the gravity of hopelessness finally loosen its grip. <words>358</words>

He pushed the diary toward his youngest self. <words>366</words>

"Plant something real," Marcus whispered, already feeling himself dissolve. <words>375</words>

The abandoned schoolhouse sighed as Lucky Chen disappeared, leaving only a boy with dirty hands and seeds in his pockets, ready to defy fate not through cards or dice, but through patient cultivation of something incorruptible. <words>411</words>

The bottle stopped spinning. <words>415</words>

Outside, in the ghost town's first miracle, a garden began to grow. <words>428</words>
