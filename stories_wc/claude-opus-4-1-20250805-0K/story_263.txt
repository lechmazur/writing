Brother Tidewhisper, zealot assassin of the Reef Orthodox, clutched his faded carnival prize plush—a decrepit octopus won decades ago at the surface world's last fair before the Great Submergence. <words>26</words> During his daily nature walks through the coral boulevards of New Atlantica, he'd stroke the threadbare tentacles with calculatedly playful gestures, rehearsing his sermon. <words>50</words> Today's topic: retelling the epic of the Flood from Neptune's perspective. <words>62</words>

"You see," he murmured to a passing school of angelfish with humorous solemnity, "history calls Neptune the villain, but consider his position." <words>84</words> The fish scattered, their movements creating reversed echoes in the water—ripples that somehow flowed backward toward their source, a phenomenon unique to this depth. <words>109</words> Brother Tidewhisper had discovered that these reversed echoes could consolidate memories, pulling fragments of the past into singular, crystalline truths. <words>130</words>

He paused at the Cathedral of Calcium, where bleached coral spires twisted toward the filtered sunlight above. <words>147</words> "Neptune didn't flood the world," he continued his practice sermon, twirling the plush octopus like a puppeteer. <words>165</words> "He saved it from burning." <words>170</words> The toy's button eyes, one missing, seemed to wink knowingly. <words>181</words>

As the reef city's premier eliminator of heretics, Tidewhisper had ended seventeen lives with the same calculated playfulness he now applied to philosophy. <words>205</words> Each kill had been a nature walk of sorts—stalking prey through kelp forests, timing strikes with tidal shifts. <words>224</words> But the reversed echoes had recently shown him something disturbing: in each victim's final moment, he'd seen his own face reflected in their eyes, not as hero but as monster. <words>255</words>

"Morality," he told a moray eel emerging from its cave, "is merely perspective viewed through water." <words>272</words> The eel, unimpressed, retreated. <words>276</words>

He reached the Amphitheater of Anemones, where tomorrow he would deliver his radical sermon. <words>290</words> Would the congregation accept Neptune as misunderstood savior rather than aquatic terrorist? <words>302</words> Would they understand that Brother Tidewhisper himself, like Neptune, had killed only to preserve their underwater paradise? <words>319</words>

The plush octopus seemed heavier now, waterlogged with decades of doubt. <words>330</words> Through the reversed echoes, he could hear tomorrow's congregation already laughing—or were they screaming? <words>345</words> Time flowed strangely here, where cause followed effect and villains might be heroes. <words>359</words>

He pressed the toy to his chest, feeling its soggy cotton heart against his own. <words>375</words> "Tomorrow," he whispered, "I'll consolidate all the fractured stories into one truth: every villain believes they're the hero of their own epic." <words>399</words> The reversed echoes carried his words backward through time, reaching the moment before his first kill, when he too had been innocent. <words>422</words> The faded carnival prize plush smiled its stitched smile, the last witness to a world before water claimed everything. <words>441</words>
