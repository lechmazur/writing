Professor Elara Voss adjusted her spectacles, watching flour dust spiral through the flooded opera house's dim lantern light. <words>15</words> The water, ankle-deep and still rising, reflected the flickering flames while she continued mixing her improbable cake batter on the orchestra pit's elevated platform. <words>41</words> 

She had discovered the sketches quite by accident—delicate drawings hidden in the binding of her grandmother's Latin dictionary, depicting this very opera house before its abandonment. <words>67</words> Each sketch showed figures gathered here during floods, performing what appeared to be elaborate rituals involving baked goods and ancient texts. <words>88</words> The drawings had led her to the clay tablet, buried beneath the stage's rotting floorboards, its runes promising something extraordinary: a gathering of echoes, where past voices could speak through present actions. <words>120</words>

Elara knocked three times on the mixing bowl—a technically mischievous interpretation of the tablet's instructions, which called for "striking thrice upon the vessel of transformation." <words>144</words> The sound reverberated through the waterlogged hall with unnatural clarity, and suddenly she wasn't alone. <words>160</words> 

Translucent figures materialized in the orchestra seats, their forms wavering like heat mirages, each one a scholar from a different era who had stood exactly where she stood now. <words>190</words> They watched her with knowing smiles as she folded cardamom and rose water into the batter—ingredients mentioned in both the tablet's runes and her grandmother's marginal notes. <words>218</words>

"You understand," whispered a Victorian gentleman, his voice barely distinguishable from the water's lapping. <words>233</words> "Each generation thinks itself the pinnacle of knowledge, grows complacent in its certainties." <words>246</words>

Elara nodded, her reticent nature transformed by purpose. <words>254</words> She had spent years in dusty archives, watching colleagues publish safe theories while revolutionary ideas moldered in forgotten texts. <words>274</words> Tonight's ritual—part performance, part culinary alchemy, part academic rebellion—would change that. <words>285</words>

As the cake rose in her portable oven (battery-powered, naturally—she was mischievous, not impractical), the echoes grew stronger. <words>304</words> Each scholar shared a fragment of lost knowledge, theories that had threatened the comfortable assumptions of their times. <words>323</words> The opera house became a symposium across centuries, its flooded floor a river of time itself. <words>340</words>

When she pulled the finished cake from the oven, its surface bore the tablet's runes, perfectly reproduced in golden crust. <words>361</words> She laughed—a sound both thoughtful and delighted—as she understood the final truth. <words>374</words> The gathering of echoes wasn't about recovering the past but about ensuring the future would never stop questioning. <words>393</words> 

The water continued rising, but Elara felt only pensive mirth as she shared slices with ghosts, each bite a promise to dethrone complacency wherever it took root. <words>421</words> Tomorrow, her colleagues would find her research notes, illustrated with her grandmother's sketches, proposing theories that would shake their comfortable foundations. <words>443</words> Tonight, she baked with the dead and learned that revolution sometimes begins with flour, eggs, and the courage to knock. <words>464</words>
