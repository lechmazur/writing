Magnus's massive hands trembled as he pieced together the shredded treasure map he'd discovered beneath the greenhouse's rotting floorboards, each fragment revealing another path through the labyrinth of carnivorous flora. <words>26</words> The docile bruiser had spent three nights assembling the pieces while distant drum solos echoed from the conservatory's abandoned concert hall, their rhythm matching his careful work. <words>53</words> The map promised the location of the conductor's baton—the one rumored to raise the dead—hidden somewhere in this verdant maze of teeth and thorns. <words>78</words>

He entered the greenhouse with disturbingly calm precision, his bulk moving delicately between Venus flytraps the size of armchairs. <words>97</words> The plants whispered in their ancient language, one Magnus couldn't understand despite months of study. <words>112</words> This language barrier had always frustrated him—a gentle giant who spoke seven human tongues but couldn't grasp the dialect of deadly botanicals. <words>134</words>

"Shhh, beautiful," he murmured with brash tenderness to a snapping sundew, twisting his torso to avoid its acidic tendrils. <words>153</words> The drum solos intensified from the hall, and Magnus recognized the pattern—someone was playing Morse code through percussion. <words>171</words> "DANGER... AHEAD... TRUST... PLANTS..." <words>175</words>

He paused, considering this message. <words>180</words> The map had led him past pitcher plants gurgling with dissolved mice, through corridors of cobra lilies swaying hypnotically. <words>199</words> Now, at the labyrinth's heart, he found it: the ivory baton, clutched in the roots of a massive corpse flower. <words>219</words>

Magnus approached with reverent slowness. <words>224</words> His mother had been the conservatory's conductor before the plants consumed her during a performance. <words>239</words> The locals whispered that she'd tried to control the greenhouse with music, to mold a myth from the mud of reality—transforming killer plants into a harmonious garden. <words>267</words> She'd failed. <words>269</words>

The corpse flower opened its petals, releasing a stench that made Magnus's eyes water. <words>283</words> Inside, impossibly, stood his mother, half-plant, half-human, conducting invisible music with her fingers. <words>297</words> She spoke in the plant language now, her words unintelligible but her meaning clear through her sorrowful eyes. <words>315</words>

Magnus understood. <words>317</words> The baton hadn't been hidden—it had been bait. <words>326</words> His mother had become the bridge between worlds, neither fully dead nor alive. <words>339</words> With disturbing calm, he reached for the baton, knowing that taking it meant accepting her role. <words>355</words> As his fingers closed around the ivory, he felt the twist in his spine, bark spreading across his skin. <words>374</words> The drum solos crescendoed as Magnus began his transformation, finally understanding the plants' whispers. <words>388</words> They weren't speaking a different language—they were speaking in pure emotion, in hunger and loneliness and love. <words>405</words> Magnus conducted his first silent symphony, tears streaming down his increasingly green face, embracing the myth his mother had died trying to create. <words>429</words>
