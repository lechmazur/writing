The mist rolled across Zephyr Bluff like a living thing, swallowing sound and sight in its silver hush. [17] Margot pressed her back against the frozen rock face, feeling the weight of the engraved pillbox in her coat pocket. [37] Three years since Moscow had burned her, left her name and face on every intelligence network's kill list. [55] Three years of running, hiding, surviving. [61] But tonight, at the tilt of the earth toward spring, when the last winter storms gave way to something softer, she had come to fix what was broken. [90]

The pillbox had arrived two weeks ago through channels she'd thought dead. [102] Inside, a single morphine tablet—unused, unnecessary—and coordinates etched into the silver: this place, this time. [118] She knew the handwriting in those tiny scratches. [126] Viktor, her handler, the one who'd vouchsafed her extraction papers before the operation went sideways. [141] The one who'd promised to pull her out. [149] The one who'd vanished when everything burned. [156]

She moved along the cliff edge, prudently daring in her approach. [167] The accumulated snow from winter's last gasp had melted and refrozen in patterns across the rock face. [184] There—she saw it now. [188] Not random ice formations but careful work: Cyrillic letters formed by packed snow in the crevices, invisible unless you knew to look. [211] Old GRU field code, the kind they'd taught in the basement rooms of the Aquarium. [227]

"Your courage waits where you left it." [234]

The message made her chest tighten. [240] She followed the trail of snow-codes down the bluff's eastern face, each cluster of white revealing another piece: "The break was intentional." [263] "The fire, necessary." [266] "Trust what remains." [269]

A figure emerged from the mist below, climbing steadily upward. [279] Viktor looked older, his face carved by wind and worry, but his eyes held the same steady intelligence she remembered. [299] He stopped ten feet away, hands visible, movements careful. [308]

"Margot." [309] His voice carried on the thin mountain air. [317] "I'm sorry for Moscow." [321]

"You let me burn." [325] The words came out steady, controlled. [331] Three years of anger compressed into four syllables. [339]

"I made you disappear." [343] He reached into his jacket slowly, pulled out a folder. [353] "The operation didn't fail. [357] We needed someone completely outside, someone every agency would believe was burned." [369] He set the folder on a flat rock between them. [379] "Someone with unused courage, waiting for the moment when it mattered most." [391]

She didn't move toward the folder. [397] "And that moment is now?" [402]

"There's a mole in the highest levels—not ours, theirs. [411] Someone selling nuclear protocols to non-state actors." [418] The mist swirled between them like a curtain. [426] "We've known for three years but couldn't move without proof." [436] Viktor gestured to the folder. [441] "That contains everything: accounts, dead drops, recordings." [448] "But it needs someone with no allegiance, no handlers, no home to deliver it." [462]

Margot understood now. [465] The burning hadn't broken her; it had freed her. [474] She was the ghost in the machine, the agent without a country who could walk into any embassy, any newsroom, any intelligence service and be believed precisely because she belonged to none of them. [508]

She picked up the folder, feeling its weight—lighter than three years of running, heavier than any mission she'd carried before. [529] "After this?" [531]

"After this, you choose." [535] Viktor pulled out a second pillbox, identical to the first but newly engraved. [548] "Swiss account numbers. [551] New papers if you want them. [557] Or come home." [560] He paused. [562] "The real home, not the one that burned you." [570]

The spring wind picked up, dispersing the mist for a moment. [581] Below them, the world spread out in the silver-hushed dawn: cities waking, borders meaning nothing from this height, the whole broken machinery of nations and secrets looking small and fixable. [613]

Margot pocketed both pillboxes and the folder. [620] Her unused courage had been waiting here all along, not in hiding but in choosing when to emerge. [638] "I'll deliver it," she said. [643] "Then we'll see what needs fixing next." [650]

Viktor nodded and turned back down the bluff. [658] She watched him disappear into the mist, then began her own descent. [670] The snow-codes were already melting in the morning sun, their message delivered, their purpose complete. [686] At the tilt of the earth toward spring, everything broken could be mended—or at least transformed into something useful. [705] She moved through the silver hush of dawn, no longer burned but forged. [718]
