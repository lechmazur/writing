The blank-faced performer sat beneath the giant ferns, her fingers moving across invisible keys as waterfalls thundered overhead. <words>16</words> She wore a plain plastic ring on her thumb—the mark of those who guard rumors in the Whispering Orchard. <words>34</words> Every evening during her piano practice, she came here where the fern fronds grew tall as redwoods and the cascading water sang in frequencies only she could parse. <words>63</words>

Her name was Vera, and she was uniquely typical among her kind—a guardian who collected the dreams that leaked from sleeping minds and crystallized into rumors. <words>89</words> The other guardians worked in libraries or subway stations, but Vera had discovered that the intersection of water, vegetation, and music created the perfect acoustic chamber for dream-catching. <words>118</words> Her blank expression wasn't emptiness but concentration; behind those still features, she processed thousands of whispered possibilities. <words>135</words>

Tonight, she tracked moon paths through the gaps in the fern canopy, calculating when the lunar alignment would approve her request. <words>157</words> She needed permission to learn the language of dreams directly, not just collect their echoes as rumors. <words>175</words> The Council of Guardians had denied her three times before, claiming she was too young, too ambitious, too human. <words>195</words>

But Vera had discovered something they hadn't—the plain plastic ring wasn't just a symbol. <words>210</words> When moonlight struck it at the precise angle, filtered through waterfall mist and fern shadows, it became a translator. <words>230</words> She'd been practicing her silent piano concertos here for months, each note calibrating her consciousness to match the frequency of sleeping thoughts. <words>253</words>

The moon emerged fully now, its path crossing the third waterfall's apex. <words>265</words> Vera's fingers stilled on her phantom keyboard as the ring began to warm. <words>279</words> Around her, the rumors she'd been guarding started to speak in their original tongue—not words but pure meaning, raw emotion, unfiltered possibility. <words>303</words>

A dream about flying tasted purple. <words>309</words> A nightmare of falling smelled like copper pennies. <words>318</words> A recurring vision of lost love felt like velvet against her thoughts. <words>330</words>

This was it—the precise madness she'd been seeking. <words>339</words> Not the careful cataloging of secondhand whispers, but direct communion with the unconscious river that fed all human stories. <words>359</words> The Council would have to approve her now; she'd proven that their uniquely typical guardian had discovered an extraordinary method. <words>380</words>

As her piano practice ended and the moon continued its path beyond the orchard, Vera stood. <words>397</words> Her face remained blank, but inside, she carried a symphony of dreams, each one perfectly translated, perfectly understood. <words>416</words> Tomorrow, she would return to continue her lessons in this ancient language, one moonlit practice at a time. <words>435</words> The waterfalls sang approval, and the giant ferns bent their fronds in acknowledgment of their newest dream-speaker. <words>452</words>
