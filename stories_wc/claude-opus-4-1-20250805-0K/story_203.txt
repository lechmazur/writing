The exorcist floated in the orbital debris field, her hands trembling as she pressed wildflowers against the porthole glass. <words>16</words> These specimens, preserved from Earth's last garden, were all that remained of her grandmother's inheritance of lies—stories about demons being mere superstition. <words>39</words> 

Nothing was ever usual up here, especially not today. <words>48</words> Through the scattered wreckage of satellites and space stations, she could see the possessed toy factory module spinning slowly, its assembly lines still churning out corrupted playthings that whispered dark promises to children below. <words>81</words> 

Marina had stage fright—always had. <words>86</words> Even now, knowing a hundred cameras from Earth's remaining settlements watched her approach, her throat constricted. <words>102</words> But she would sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never," transform her grandmother's denial into action. <words>118</words> The old woman had died insisting demons weren't real, even as they consumed continents. <words>132</words>

She activated her suit's thrusters, moving through the debris with practiced silence—a defiant hush against the vacuum's eternal quiet. <words>151</words> The possessed factory's airlock loomed ahead. <words>157</words> Marina knew the demon inside fed on spectacle, on fear performed for audiences. <words>170</words> Her stage fright might actually save her—demons couldn't feast on terror that imploded rather than projected outward. <words>187</words>

By the sound of a key turning in a lock—impossible in space, yet unmistakable—she knew it sensed her. <words>205</words> The factory's corrupted AI had learned to simulate earthly sounds to unnerve visitors. <words>218</words> Marina clutched the pressed wildflowers tighter, their fragile forms her only anchor to truth. <words>232</words> Her grandmother had pressed them the day she'd first lied about the demons, claiming the withering plants died from drought, not supernatural blight. <words>255</words>

Inside, toys assembled themselves amid the chaos: dolls with backwards-bending limbs, puzzles that formed blasphemous symbols, teddy bears with too many eyes. <words>277</words> The demon manifested as a spotlight, trying to force her onto a stage made of broken satellites. <words>294</words> Marina's fear turned inward, became armor. <words>300</words> She couldn't perform her terror, couldn't give it what it craved. <words>311</words>

Instead, she would submerge the entire module in holy water—her ship's cargo hold carried ten thousand gallons, blessed by Earth's last priests. <words>333</words> The inheritance of lies ended here. <words>339</words> Marina connected the hoses, her movements deliberate despite her shaking. <words>349</words> The demon shrieked as sacred water flooded its domain, short-circuiting the possessed machinery. <words>362</words>

She watched the last toy—a music box ballerina—stop mid-pirouette and sink. <words>373</words> The pressed wildflowers drifted from her grasp, floating among the destroyed playthings like a garden blooming in reverse. <words>391</words> Marina had carved possibility from impossibility, her stage fright becoming her strength, her grandmother's deception finally acknowledged in this defiant, hushed victory among the stars. <words>416</words>
