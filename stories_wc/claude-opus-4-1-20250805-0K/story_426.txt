Mira ran the same route every morning: three loops around the abandoned Wonderland Park, past the rusted ghost train that hadn't moved since 1987. <words>22</words> She was training for November's marathon, but really she was listening—decoding the bizarre playlists she'd hacked into the park's still-functioning speaker system, each track containing encrypted coordinates in its metadata. <words>54</words> Once, she'd been Silicon Valley's youngest cryptography prodigy at fourteen, until she'd vanished into obscurity after exposing pharmaceutical giants for suppressing traditional remedies. <words>78</words> Now, at thirty-two, she worked as a secretive pathfinder, using her skills to map hidden groves where endangered medicinal plants still grew wild. <words>101</words>

The ghost train's tunnel exhaled cold air even in summer. <words>111</words> She'd discovered that its maintenance booth contained a perfect dead-drop: a cracked porcelain teapot left by the park's last groundskeeper, who'd shared her mission before cancer took him. <words>140</words> Inside, she'd leave USB drives containing botanical GPS data for her network of herbalists and indigenous healers. <words>157</words> The playlists were her innovation—Swedish death metal alternating with Mongolian throat singing, frequencies that only she monitored, each song title spelling out locations when decoded. <words>182</words>

Week six of training, something changed. <words>188</words> The teapot contained a note: "Stop running." <words>195</words> Her jaw clenched—that angrily peaceful state she'd perfected, fury crystallized into focused calm. <words>209</words> Someone had found her system. <words>214</words> The next morning's playlist was different: children's lullabies mixed with industrial noise, but the metadata led nowhere. <words>231</words> A trap or a test? <words>236</words>

Week eight, she found a girl, maybe fifteen, sitting in the ghost train car, laptop open, wearing a faded Botany Club hoodie. <words>258</words> "Your encryption's beautiful," the girl said, not looking up. <words>267</words> "But you missed the Appalachian ginseng habitat in sector seven." <words>277</words> Mira recognized the focused detachment in her voice—another forgotten prodigy, discarded by a system that consumed brilliance and discarded humanity. <words>297</words>

"Who sent you?" <words>300</words> Mira's hand moved toward her phone. <words>306</words>

"My grandmother. <words>308</words> She needs the elderberry locations before the developers clear-cut next month." <words>319</words> The girl finally looked up, eyes fierce but exhausted. <words>328</words> "She said you'd understand about preserving what pharmaceutical companies want extinct." <words>339</words>

Mira saw herself reflected—the same aloof passion, the same burden of knowledge that isolation brings. <words>354</words> Week ten of training, she adjusted her route, and the girl matched her pace, sharing what she'd learned about mycorrhizal networks and digital dead-drops. <words>379</words> When Mira finally crossed the marathon finish line, the girl was waiting with the cracked teapot, now repaired with gold lacquer, filled with wild chamomile tea. <words>405</words> They didn't speak, but Mira pulled her into a brief, firm hug—passing the torch to another keeper of forgotten wisdom, another guardian of what must not be lost. <words>434</words>

The ghost train still exhales its cold breath, and the playlists still play their bizarre symphonies, but now two shadows run the morning loops, mapping the sacred places that remain. <words>464</words>
