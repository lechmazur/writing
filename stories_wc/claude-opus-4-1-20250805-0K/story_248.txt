The unsteady sentinel Kora swayed at her post, watching the abandoned space freighter docking bay through bleary eyes that had witnessed too many shifts between colliding worlds. <words>24</words> Her fingers trembled as she held the strange automaton bird, its brass wings clicking with each mechanical breath—the only sound in the vast emptiness. <words>47</words>

Three cycles ago, the prophecy had arrived in shredded letters, scattered across the bay's corroded floor like confetti from a funeral. <words>69</words> Kora had spent sleepless rotations reassembling them, piece by agonizing piece, until the message emerged: "When worlds kiss, the sentinel falls, and fate springs its trap." <words>96</words>

She laughed—a sound devoid of warmth yet brimming with desperate energy, the cheerless ecstasy of someone who'd discovered their doom written in someone else's handwriting. <words>121</words> The automaton bird tilted its head, recording everything with crystalline eyes that had seen the rise and fall of civilizations. <words>141</words>

"I recommend evacuation," it chirped suddenly, its voice cutting through the silence. <words>153</words> "The collision event approaches." <words>157</words>

Kora's smile twisted, coyly furious at the machine's presumption. <words>166</words> "You don't understand," she whispered, gripping its metal body tighter. <words>176</words> "The prophecy isn't about my death—it's been misinterpreted for generations." <words>186</words>

Through the bay's transparent aluminum walls, she could see them: two rogue planets drifting toward each other in a cosmic dance that would end in obliteration. <words>212</words> The gravitational waves were already warping the freighter's structure, making her stance even more precarious. <words>227</words>

But Kora had discovered the truth by reassembling those letters in a different order, finding hidden patterns that previous sentinels had missed. <words>248</words> The prophecy wasn't warning of doom—it was instructions for survival, deliberately obscured to prevent the unworthy from understanding. <words>266</words>

The automaton bird suddenly spread its wings, projecting holographic fragments of ancient texts into the air. <words>282</words> "You solved it," it said, its mechanical voice tinged with something almost like pride. <words>297</words>

"The ambush of fate," Kora breathed, watching the planets draw closer, "isn't death surprising us—it's life, hiding in plain sight." <words>317</words> She activated the bay's forgotten systems with codes hidden in the prophecy's true arrangement. <words>331</words>

Ancient engines hummed to life beneath her feet, and the abandoned freighter—actually an ark in disguise—began its long-dormant evacuation protocol. <words>350</words> The sentinel's duty wasn't to die with the worlds but to shepherd the survivors through the catastrophe, using the collision's energy to catapult them toward salvation. <words>377</words>

Kora stood steadier now, her purpose clear as the fog lifted from centuries of misguided interpretation. <words>393</words> The automaton bird settled on her shoulder, and together they watched fate spring its trap—not on them, but on death itself. <words>415</words> In the cheerless ecstasy of their escape, she finally understood: sometimes prophecies lie to protect their truths. <words>432</words>
