The last druid stood at the edge of her glacial orchard, watching frost-covered apple trees sway impossibly over the yawning crevasse of blue ice below. <words>20</words> Three centuries had passed since the final human footstep echoed on Earth, and she'd kept her vow of silence ever since. <words>40</words> 

Today was different. <words>43</words> Today was her thousandth birthday. <words>48</words>

She fingered the dull safety pin fastened to her bark-woven cloak—a relic from the vanished world, oxidized beyond function yet fiercely ambivalent in its symbolism: connection and separation, holding together and piercing through. <words>80</words> The other druids would gather soon, materializing from their scattered sanctuaries like morning mist. <words>94</words> They'd expect the traditional birthday feast, the one her grandmother had taught her: honeyed locusts, fermented root paste, and crystallized sap served on leaves that sang when touched. <words>122</words>

The thought made her stomach clench. <words>128</words> Not the meal itself—she'd already prepared everything with mechanical precision—but the inevitable moment when they'd wait for her to speak the blessing. <words>150</words> Three hundred years of self-imposed muteness had transformed her voice into her greatest fear. <words>164</words> What if only dust emerged? <words>169</words> What if the words came out wrong, twisted into curses instead of gratitude? <words>182</words>

A crack echoed from the ice crevasse, making her flinch. <words>192</words> She almost laughed—how absurd to fear words more than falling into infinite blue death. <words>206</words> The irony wasn't lost on her: Earth's last guardian of natural speech, terrified of her own tongue. <words>223</words>

The first druid arrived, then another, their faces simultaneously ancient and childlike. <words>235</words> They arranged themselves around her suspended grove's centerpiece—a table carved from a single glacier, perpetually frozen yet somehow warm to touch. <words>256</words> The feast appeared as she'd planned, each dish a perfect replica of birthdays past. <words>270</words> 

They waited. <words>272</words>

She opened her mouth, and the safety pin seemed to pulse against her chest, a tiny heartbeat of corroded metal. <words>292</words> The silence stretched like ice before breaking, becoming almost funny in its weight. <words>305</words> Here stood Earth's inheritors, patient as trees, waiting for words from someone who'd forgotten how to give them. <words>323</words>

"Thank you," she finally croaked, her voice like branches scraping together. <words>334</words> The sound was horrible, beautiful, and absolutely ridiculous. <words>342</words> "Thank you for gathering." <words>346</words>

The druids smiled—not with joy, but with the dour amusement of those who understood that some fears, once conquered, reveal themselves as cosmic jokes. <words>370</words> They raised their cups of fermented sap, toasting the broken silence with their own creaking voices, a chorus of ancients laughing at their own mortality. <words>395</words>

The safety pin fell from her cloak, tumbling toward the crevasse, and she let it go. <words>411</words> Some connections were meant to rust away. <words>418</words> She was learning new ones now, word by careful word. <words>428</words>
