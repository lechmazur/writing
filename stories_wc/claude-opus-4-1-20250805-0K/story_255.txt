The seer looked unremarkable in every way—average height, forgettable face, clothes that seemed to blur into any background—which made people wonder how someone so nondescript had predicted the location of the encrypted USB drive. <words>29</words> The abandoned control tower still held streamers from the surprise retirement party three hours ago, when Agent Morrison had finally been honored for the case that destroyed him. <words>56</words> Now, in the hush that follows forced celebration, only the seer remained among the paper plates and wilting balloons. <words>75</words>

"Funny how they throw parties for broken people," the seer murmured, voice carrying that peculiar mix of innocence and cynicism that made listeners uncomfortable. <words>99</words> The USB drive sat heavy in their pocket—Morrison's final gift, wrapped in tissue paper and bitter laughter. <words>116</words> "Twenty years too late for the victims, but hey, at least there was cake." <words>130</words>

The seer's gift wasn't seeing the future, exactly—it was seeing connections others missed, patterns that revealed themselves through sensory triggers. <words>150</words> Tonight's trigger came unexpectedly: the scent of first rain after drought, petrichor seeping through the tower's broken windows. <words>168</words> That smell—earth awakening, secrets rising—had always sharpened their analytically innovative mind into something transcendent. <words>182</words>

As rain drummed against glass, the seer's fingers moved across the laptop keyboard, not typing but feeling the encrypted data's rhythm. <words>203</words> Each failed password attempt taught them something new about Morrison's psychology, about the case that had haunted him. <words>221</words> The man had hidden evidence of corruption so deep it had taken two decades to surface—delayed justice wrapped in digital chains. <words>242</words>

"The Prometheus files," Morrison had whispered at his party, drunk on vindication and morphine. <words>256</words> "The mythic relic every whistleblower dreams of finding." <words>264</words> He'd pressed the USB into the seer's unremarkable hands, choosing obscurity over glory. <words>277</words> "You'll know how to untangle it when the time comes." <words>287</words>

The petrichor grew stronger, and suddenly the seer understood—the password wasn't words but dates, coordinates, the locations where bodies had been found years ago. <words>311</words> Their fingers flew across keys, each number a small rebellion against time's cruelty. <words>324</words> The encryption cracked like thunder. <words>329</words>

Files cascaded open: names, transactions, evidence that would topple dynasties. <words>338</words> The seer smiled, a child's wonder at justice finally arriving mixed with an adult's awareness of its cost. <words>356</words> Morrison would die before seeing the headlines, but his ghost would rest easier. <words>369</words>

Outside, the drought-broken rain washed the world clean, carrying the scent of earth's patience into the abandoned tower. <words>387</words> The seer uploaded everything to thirteen different news outlets, then destroyed the USB drive with innocent efficiency. <words>404</words> Some relics were meant to be unearthed only to be scattered like seeds. <words>417</words> Tomorrow, the powerful would fall. <words>422</words> Tonight, in this tower where careers had lived and died, delayed justice smelled like rain. <words>438</words>
