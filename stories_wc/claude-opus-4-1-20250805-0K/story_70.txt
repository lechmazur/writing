The uptight scribe Marcus pressed his nose against the greenhouse glass, watching the witch Elara tend her midnight blooms among the gravestones below. <words>18</words> He clutched Tesla's prototype light bulb—stolen from the workshop archives—its copper filaments dark and dormant in his sweating palm. <words>36</words>

For months, he'd transcribed Elara's correspondence, each letter sealed with lavender wax and addressed to families of the buried. <words>55</words> She never sent them. <words>59</words> Instead, she burned them in her greenhouse hearth, releasing whispers of smoke through vents that faced the cemetery. <words>77</words> Marcus had labeled her certainly uncertain—a woman of precise rituals with unknowable purposes. <words>90</words>

Tonight, he'd discovered why. <words>94</words>

By analyzing the leftover adhesive from a once-sealed envelope he'd secretly preserved, Marcus had detected traces of memory-moss, a plant that absorbed grief and transformed it into something else entirely. <words>124</words> The realization struck him in the moment when a puzzle piece finally fits—sudden, complete, irreversible. <words>140</words>

He pushed through the greenhouse door. <words>146</words> "You're healing them," he said, his usual rigid posture softening. <words>156</words>

Elara didn't turn from her work. <words>162</words> "The living or the dead?" <words>167</words>

"Both." <words>168</words>

She smiled at a pot of silver thornweed. <words>176</words> "And you've come to stop me, scribe?" <words>183</words>

Marcus held out the bulb. <words>188</words> "To help." <words>190</words>

The witch finally faced him, her eyes reflecting centuries of sorrow transformed into purpose. <words>204</words> "That won't work here—electricity fails among so much death." <words>213</words>

"Not this one." <words>216</words> Marcus connected the bulb to a peculiar battery he'd crafted from cemetery copper and memory-moss extract. <words>233</words> The filament glowed softly, casting shadows that danced like mourners finding peace. <words>245</words>

Elara's weathered hands trembled. <words>249</words> "You understand." <words>251</words>

"I understand that you cradle empathy in arms of steel," Marcus said, his voice breaking from its usual monotone. <words>270</words> "Every letter absorbs a family's grief, every burning releases it transformed." <words>281</words> He set the glowing bulb among her plants. <words>289</words> "Let me illuminate what you do." <words>295</words>

For the first time in decades, Elara allowed herself to bellow—not in anger but in release, a sound that shook the greenhouse walls and sent roots deeper into hallowed ground. <words>326</words> The light bulb pulsed in response, its glow spreading through the glass panes like dawn breaking over headstones. <words>344</words>

Marcus pulled a fresh envelope from his satchel, addressing it to himself. <words>356</words> Inside, he wrote of his own transformation—from rigid recorder to willing participant in quiet magic. <words>371</words> He sealed it with lavender wax, understanding finally that some changes happen not in grand gestures but in the gentle shift from observer to participant. <words>396</words>

Together, they watched his letter burn, its smoke spiraling toward stars that seemed, for once, almost within reach. <words>414</words>

The greenhouse hummed with buried optimism, roots and copper wire intertwining beneath soil that held both endings and beginnings. <words>433</words>

Marcus adjusted his spectacles and picked up his quill, ready to document miracles instead of merely filing them away. <words>452</words>
