Brother Kael gripped the visually unappealing package, its creased shipping label barely readable after decades in the monastery archives. <words>18</words> The aerial gondola swayed through mountain mist as he unwrapped what he'd spent years seeking—an antique bone flute, yellowed and grotesque. <words>39</words> In the heartbeat after a dream returns, that disorienting moment between sleep and waking, he'd first glimpsed this instrument clutched in bloodied hands. <words>62</words> Not just any hands—his own, though belonging to another version of himself, one who'd chosen vengeance over virtue centuries ago. <words>82</words>

The stubborn monk had dismissed it as nightmare until he discovered the monastery's hidden records of parallel incarnations, souls split across timelines. <words>103</words> His dark reflection had murdered their master in another reality, and now that shadow-self was harvesting the past, reaching through dreams to corrupt this world. <words>128</words> The flute was the key—both weapon and evidence. <words>137</words>

Kael examined the instrument with trembling fingers, noting deep tooth marks along its length. <words>151</words> Each indentation told a story; he'd learned to read them like scripture during his years studying forensic spiritualism. <words>169</words> The pattern revealed rage, desperation, and most importantly, the exact ritual his shadow-self had performed. <words>184</words> To avenge his master's death in this reality—a death that hadn't happened yet—he needed to understand how his dark twin had committed the original murder. <words>209</words>

The gondola lurched, and through its foggy windows, Kael glimpsed another gondola running parallel through the clouds. <words>226</words> Inside sat a figure in identical robes, holding an identical flute, teeth bared in a knowing smile. <words>243</words> His shadow-self had been harvesting the past too, learning Kael's moves before he made them. <words>258</words>

But Kael's stubborn nature, once considered his greatest flaw, became his salvation. <words>270</words> While his shadow-self expected him to follow the tooth marks' revealed ritual exactly, Kael deliberately reversed every step. <words>288</words> The creased shipping label, he realized, contained not an address but a prayer in microscopic text—a ward his master had hidden there. <words>310</words> He pressed it against the flute and spoke the words backward. <words>321</words>

The parallel gondola flickered like a candle flame. <words>329</words> His shadow-self's expression shifted from confidence to confusion as the carefully harvested past began unraveling. <words>344</words> The tooth marks on the flute glowed and reshaped themselves into a different pattern—one of redemption rather than revenge. <words>363</words> 

In that moment of cautious enchantment, watching his dark reflection fade into mountain mist, Kael understood. <words>379</words> To outsmart your own darkness, you must embrace the very flaws it expects you to overcome. <words>396</words> The gondola continued its journey through the peaks, carrying a stubborn monk who'd learned that sometimes the past is best harvested with forgiveness. <words>420</words>
