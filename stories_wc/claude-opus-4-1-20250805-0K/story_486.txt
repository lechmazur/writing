The sound engineer's fingers trembled as she adjusted frequencies that bent reality itself, each twist of her mixing board warping the witch's cauldron room around her. <words>23</words> Above the bubbling vessel, a stained glass fragment hung suspended, its colors bleeding into the air like watercolor wounds. <words>41</words> She had stolen it from the cathedral where the mob had gathered, their roar still echoing in dimensions she could no longer reach. <words>64</words>

Her revenge would be silent. <words>69</words>

The cauldron room existed between heartbeats, in that perfect hush after a chalkboard is erased but before new words are written. <words>90</words> Here, time moved differently, allowing her to craft her retribution with the patience of centuries compressed into moments. <words>108</words> She was clumsily dexterous with her equipment, knocking over vials of liquid sound while simultaneously weaving acoustic spells that would remake the world. <words>132</words>

Through her monitors, she watched the public squares where her pantomime confessions would soon play out. <words>148</words> The mob that had driven her here, that had burned her mentor as a witch, would witness their own sins performed in absolute silence by their own bodies. <words>177</words> They would become unwilling actors in her critique of their violence, their limbs moving against their will to enact the cruelties they had inflicted. <words>201</words>

The stained glass fragment pulsed with each adjustment she made, a conductor for the practical illusion she was orchestrating. <words>220</words> It had witnessed their rage from the cathedral window, and now it would channel their confession. <words>237</words> She modulated another frequency, and somewhere in the real world, a leader of the mob began to move his hands, signing his guilt to the crowd that could no longer speak. <words>268</words>

One by one, she would steal their voices, transforming their roar into the very silence they had tried to impose on her. <words>290</words> The cauldron's steam carried her adjustments upward, through dimensions, infiltrating larynxes and vocal cords with precision. <words>306</words> She knocked over another beaker with her elbow while perfectly calibrating the resonance that would lock their tongues. <words>324</words>

In the squares, the pantomime confessions began in earnest. <words>333</words> Bodies moved like marionettes, acting out scenes of persecution while their owners watched helplessly from behind their own eyes. <words>353</words> The crowd's roar died to whispers, then to nothing, as her sonic manipulation spread like a benevolent plague. <words>371</words>

She smiled, adjusting one final dial that would cement the illusion into reality. <words>385</words> The witch's cauldron room would fade, but the silence would remain, a practical lesson in the weight of words never spoken. <words>406</words> The stained glass fragment shattered, its purpose complete, each shard carrying the hush to corners of the world where mobs might gather. <words>429</words> Her critique was completeâ€”not through words or violence, but through the terrible poetry of enforced mime, the most honest confession of all. <words>453</words>

Reality bent one last time, and she disappeared into the frequency between silence and sound. <words>468</words>
