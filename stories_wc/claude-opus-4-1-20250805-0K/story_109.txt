Sir Marcus stood at the deserted intersection, his breath forming crystals in the midnight air as he clutched the tiny mitten. <words>16</words> The child's lost garment—powder blue with embroidered snowflakes—had been his signal to enter the converted warehouse that served as the agency's covert operations center. <words>42</words> Inside, fluorescent lights hummed over rows of incomplete family altars, each missing a crucial photograph or heirloom, deliberately unfinished to maintain operational security. <words>66</words> These partial shrines weren't mere decorations; they were the agency's method of supporting deep-cover operatives by preserving fragments of their abandoned lives. <words>89</words>

Marcus had never understood art until tonight. <words>96</words> The cold that had always defined him—that emotional permafrost that made him the agency's most effective interrogator—began to crack as he studied the altar assigned to him. <words>124</words> Someone had arranged dried herbs around his mother's portrait: feverfew for headaches, elderflower for grief, willow bark for the pain of remembering. <words>146</words> Folk remedies she'd taught him before the agency recruited him at fourteen. <words>158</words>

"You're late," Director Chen said, emerging from shadows. <words>166</words> "The mitten belongs to the daughter of our Prague asset." <words>176</words> She gestured to an unfinished altar where a child's drawing lay beside incense. <words>189</words> "She doesn't know her father exists." <words>195</words>

Marcus touched the dried lavender on his own altar, and suddenly understood. <words>207</words> These incomplete memorials weren't just operational necessity—they were art installations, each one a meditation on sacrifice and absence. <words>226</words> The agency had discovered that agents performed better when they could channel their losses into something tangible, even if fragmentary. <words>246</words> It was lawfully rebellious, this sanctioned expression of grief within the rigid structure of intelligence work. <words>262</words>

"I've been collecting them," Marcus admitted, pulling a leather journal from his coat. <words>275</words> "The folk remedies. Every mission, every country." <words>282</words> He opened it to reveal pressed herbs, annotated with uses in dozens of languages. <words>296</words> "My mother's knowledge, expanded across the world." <words>303</words>

Chen studied him carefully. <words>307</words> "The cold-natured knight discovers he has a heart after all." <words>317</words>

Marcus placed the mitten on the Prague asset's altar, completing a circle of objects around the child's drawing. <words>335</words> "Not a heart," he corrected. <words>340</words> "An artistic awakening." <words>343</words> He understood now that his emotional distance had been another kind of art—a performance sustained for so long he'd forgotten it was a choice. <words>368</words> The folk remedies weren't just medical knowledge; they were poems of healing, stories of survival passed between generations like this mitten would one day be passed from parent to child. <words>399</words>

Outside, the intersection remained empty, but Marcus no longer felt alone. <words>410</words> The incomplete altars had shown him that supporting others didn't require wholeness—sometimes the missing pieces spoke loudest. <words>427</words> He tucked his journal away and walked back into the cold night, carrying his mother's wisdom and his newfound understanding that even ice could be sculpted into something beautiful. <words>457</words>
