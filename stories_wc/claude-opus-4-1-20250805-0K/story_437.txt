Brother Thorne's fingers trembled as he arranged the ceramic owl figurine among the orchids, its painted eyes reflecting the greenish light filtering through the greenhouse city's vast glass ceiling. <words>24</words> Outside, toxic clouds rolled across the sky, their poison held at bay by the transparent barriers that had protected New Eden for three generations. <words>47</words>

"The flowers speak," he announced to his gathered followers, though his voice wavered like a child reciting lines he didn't understand. <words>68</words> The cult members swayed in their semicircle, their faces wearing that peculiar expression of doleful cheer—smiling through tears that had long since become habit. <words>93</words>

Rain began pattering against the glass above, each droplet carrying traces of the old world's mistakes. <words>110</words> Thorne lifted a faded photograph from the altar, its surface shimmering with the ghost-marks of tears shed by its previous owner, now dead. <words>134</words> "See how the salt crystals form patterns?" he whispered, tilting the image so they could observe the delicate tracery. <words>153</words> "Like veins in a petal, like roots seeking water—this is how the flowers taught the first gardeners to survive." <words>173</words>

He was lying, of course. <words>178</words> Thorne had no more understanding of the botanical language than anyone else in this verdant prison, but his followers needed to believe someone did. <words>203</words> The ceramic owl had belonged to his grandmother, who claimed flowers whispered secrets about which combinations of growing things could purify the air fastest. <words>227</words> She'd died clutching it, babbling about tulips that could translate human sorrow into oxygen. <words>242</words>

The greenhouse city sprawled endlessly in every direction, its sectors divided by species—roses, ferns, food crops—each tended by different cults, all claiming botanical communion. <words>266</words> The boundaries between sacred and scientific, between survival and worship, had blurred beyond recognition. <words>281</words> Everyone moved through their days in patterns both rigid and flowing—statically dynamic, like plants following the sun while rooted in place. <words>303</words>

"Brother Thorne," ventured Sister Marie, her eyes bright with desperate hope, "the marigolds in Sector Seven have begun flowering out of season." <words>325</words>

He nodded sagely, though his stomach churned. <words>332</words> Another sign to interpret, another moment to influence through careful vagueness and borrowed authority. <words>347</words> The rain intensified, drumming urgent rhythms that almost sounded like words. <words>358</words> Perhaps the flowers really were speaking, he thought, but only to say what everyone already knew—that they were all trapped together, human and plant alike, breathing each other's air, dependent on mysteries nobody truly comprehended. <words>396</words>

The ceramic owl stared blindly at them all, wise and hollow, a perfect symbol for his leadership. <words>413</words> Thorne touched the photograph's tear-stained surface once more, feeling the faint shimmer of dried salt beneath his fingertips, and began inventing another revelation about roots and redemption. <words>440</words> His followers leaned in, eager to believe, their faces glowing with that terrible, necessary hope that kept them tending the gardens through each poisonous dawn. <words>465</words>
