The letter arrived at Himeji Castle during seed planting season, addressed to a samurai dead for three centuries. <words>17</words> Marcus Kane, former sheriff of Tombstone, adjusted his vintage spectacles as the confused courier bowed and retreated. <words>33</words> He'd fled Arizona's bloodlands to Japan seeking peace, yet here was correspondence from his past, probably improbable in its timing. <words>53</words> 

The envelope contained fragments of a photograph—his deputy's badge, a woman's hand, blood on adobe walls. <words>69</words> Kane's fingers trembled as he began gathering broken pieces of the image on the tatami mat. <words>85</words> Each fragment stirred memories he'd buried beneath ten thousand miles of ocean. <words>97</words> The woman was Maria, shot dead because she'd loved a lawman who'd chosen justice over the cartel. <words>114</words>

"You cannot plant rice with clenched fists," the castle's elderly groundskeeper had taught him. <words>128</words> But Kane's hands still knew only triggers and vengeance, even as he pretended to learn agriculture's patient rhythms. <words>146</words> The letter's sender—his former partner—had written: "They found you. Run." <words>156</words>

Outside, farmers sang while pressing seeds into flooded fields, their voices carrying a corroded rapture. <words>171</words> They celebrated growth while remembering famine, joy forever tainted by generational trauma. <words>183</words> Kane understood their haunted happiness; he felt it whenever morning sun caught the castle's ancient stones. <words>199</words> Beauty existed, but shadows lived inside it. <words>206</words>

He reassembled the photograph completely. <words>211</words> Maria smiled beside him at the courthouse, before everything turned to bullets and blood. <words>225</words> The cartel had sent this—not to threaten, but to stir him toward inevitable violence. <words>239</words> They knew him better than he knew himself. <words>247</words>

Through his spectacles, blurred by unexpected tears, Kane watched the farmers work. <words>259</words> Their movements held centuries of wisdom about breaking cycles—how warriors became cultivators, swords became plowshares. <words>274</words> The castle had witnessed both siege and harvest, understanding that destruction and creation were seasons, not destinies. <words>291</words>

He burned the photograph in the brazier, watching Maria's face curl into smoke. <words>304</words> The letter had found the wrong address but the right person—someone finally ready to stay buried. <words>320</words> Tomorrow, he would plant seeds with the others, his gunfighter's hands learning gentleness through repetition. <words>335</words> The cartel could come; they would find only a ghost tending gardens in a fortress that had outlasted greater violence than theirs. <words>357</words>

Kane removed his spectacles, polishing lenses that had seen too much blood. <words>369</words> The farmers' song rose higher, triumphant despite its undertone of sorrow. <words>380</words> He would join them at dawn, gathering broken pieces of himself into something that could grow. <words>396</words> Even probable death felt improbable compared to this: a killer learning to create life. <words>410</words>
