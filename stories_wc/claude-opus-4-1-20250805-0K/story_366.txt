Marcus pressed the vintage button hook against his temple, its cold brass triggering another cascade of customer thoughts flooding through the transmission repair dock's makeshift café. <words>20</words> He'd abandoned his promising corporate telepathy career to serve coffee here, where mechanics nursed their drinks between shifts, and he could practice reading the weather patterns locked in their memories. <words>50</words>

"Another latte?" he asked Jenkins, already knowing the answer. <words>59</words> The old mechanic's mind hummed with decades of observing frost patterns on windshields, oil viscosity changes, the way transmissions seized differently in each microclimate. <words>83</words> Marcus was efficiently inefficient in his service—taking forever to steam milk while mining each customer's weather observations, using the button hook as an amplifier for weaker signals. <words>111</words>

Autumn pressed against winter outside, that dangerous cusp when black ice formed unexpectedly. <words>124</words> Marcus had been decoding weather journals all wrong until he'd discovered this place. <words>138</words> Traditional meteorologists studied instruments and satellites, but the real patterns lived in working people's accumulated experience. <words>154</words> He'd found more truth in a mechanic's memory of how brake fluid thickened than in a hundred academic papers. <words>173</words>

"You're that psychic guy who quit Syntech," Jenkins said, watching Marcus work. <words>185</words> "Threw away a fortune to pour coffee." <words>192</words>

Marcus smiled, cloaking his true purpose behind the steam wand's hiss. <words>203</words> Success wasn't the corner office he'd left behind—it was understanding the ice crystal patterns forming in the glacier forty miles north, patterns that would determine this valley's weather for the next decade. <words>237</words> The transmission dock sat at the exact confluence of three weather systems, and every mechanic who worked here carried pieces of the puzzle in their minds. <words>263</words>

He touched the button hook again, this time catching Sarah's thoughts as she waited for her espresso. <words>280</words> She was remembering last spring's unusual transmission failures, all clustering around the same atmospheric pressure readings. <words>296</words> Another piece clicked into place in Marcus's mental map. <words>305</words>

"Noble foolishness," his former boss had called it when Marcus resigned. <words>316</words> But Marcus had discovered something profound: the most accurate weather model wasn't built in supercomputers but lived distributed across thousands of ordinary minds. <words>339</words> Each mechanic who noticed how humidity affected gear oil, each driver who felt the barometric pressure in their joints—they were all unknowing meteorologists. <words>362</words>

As he handed Sarah her cup, their fingers brushed, and he caught one final image: ice crystals spreading across a transmission casing in a pattern that perfectly matched the glacier's deep structure. <words>395</words> The connection he'd been seeking for months blazed clear. <words>404</words> Marcus's redefined success tasted better than any corporate triumph—he'd found the algorithm of weather written in grease and memory, decoded through the noble foolishness of serving coffee to prophets who never knew their gift. <words>439</words>
