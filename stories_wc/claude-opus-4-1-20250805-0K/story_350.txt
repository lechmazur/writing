The back-alley puppeteer waited until the last riddle was whispered at the puzzle event, watching scholars drift from the ancient Greek temple like smoke. <words>20</words> Now alone, Dimitri approached the marble altar where moonlight pooled through collapsed ceiling stones. <words>34</words> His weathered fingers, trained to make marionettes dance in Athens' forgotten corners, trembled as they found the trunk hidden beneath centuries of dust. <words>57</words>

Inside lay an irritatingly perfect wedding gown, its silk untouched by time. <words>69</words> But Dimitri knew better than to trust perfection. <words>77</words> His mother had worn this dress, married in this very temple before it crumbled, before she vanished into myth. <words>96</words> He lifted the fabric, searching, and discovered tears in the folds—deliberate cuts forming a pattern. <words>111</words>

Through these openings, he could see something pressed flat: a vintage stamp album. <words>124</words> Each page revealed not stamps but tiny photographs of puppet shows, performances his mother had given across Greece, documenting stories she'd told through wooden figures. <words>149</words> The images were arranged like musical notes, creating what she'd called her "symphonies of truth"—puppet shows that exposed the lies of powerful men who'd destroyed this temple, who'd silenced artists. <words>180</words>

Dimitri understood now why she'd hidden this evidence here, why she'd chosen to remodel her wedding gown into a secret keeper. <words>201</words> The dress had been her disguise at society gatherings where she'd gathered these truths, playing the perfect bride while her puppets whispered revolution in back alleys. <words>227</words>

He held the album against his chest, feeling the weight of inherited purpose. <words>240</words> The puzzle event had been his cover to enter this sacred space, just as she'd planned decades ago in her final letter. <words>262</words> Each riddle tonight had been a test, ensuring only someone who understood her puppet-craft's secret language could decode the dress's message. <words>283</words>

In this moment of alone intimacy with his mother's ghost, Dimitri saw how she'd orchestrated everything. <words>299</words> The photographs formed a map to hidden puppet theaters across Athens where her followers still waited. <words>315</words> He would remodel himself now, transform from street performer to keeper of her symphonies of truth. <words>331</words>

As dawn approached, he carefully folded the dress back into the trunk, the album secure in his satchel. <words>349</words> His fingers moved with new purpose, already imagining the strings he'd pull to resurrect her revolution. <words>365</words> The temple's broken columns cast shadows like giant marionettes, and Dimitri smiled, knowing his mother's truth would dance again through Athens' back alleys, one puppet show at a time. <words>395</words> The hidden truth was uncovered: revolution never died, it simply waited for the next puppeteer. <words>410</words>
