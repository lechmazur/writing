The wandering orchardist descended through the murky waters, her collection of dried leaves sealed in wax against her chest. <words>17</words> Each leaf bore the memory of a tree from a different universe—apple orchards that bloomed underwater, pear trees that grew in vacuum, cherries that ripened in reversed time. <words>46</words> 

The forgotten underwater city hall loomed before her, its marble columns wrapped in bioluminescent algae that pulsed like dying stars. <words>66</words> She'd spent lifetimes mapping trade routes through the multiverse, but this place held the key to understanding why certain paths between worlds had collapsed. <words>90</words> The locals had called it kitchen table wisdom—the simple truth that the best negotiations happened where people broke bread together, even if those people existed in different dimensional planes. <words>119</words>

Inside the flooded chamber, she found what she'd come to reclaim: the Concordance Table, where interdimensional merchants once gathered. <words>137</words> Its surface was scarred by cups from a thousand different worlds, each ring a portal's echo. <words>154</words> She spread her leaves across the table, each one a map fragment showing orchards that existed as waypoints between realities. <words>174</words>

The phantom hand touched her shoulder—her business partner from three universes ago, dead now but still trustworthy in his unique way. <words>195</words> His spectral fingers traced the connections between leaves, showing her what living eyes couldn't see: the roots that connected every orchard across every possible timeline. <words>220</words> 

"The trees remember," his voice whispered through the water, though no bubbles rose. <words>233</words> "Even when the paths are forgotten, the seeds carry the memory of every trade route their fruit ever traveled." <words>252</words>

She understood then why she'd been drawn to tend orchards in every reality she visited. <words>267</words> Each tree was a beacon, a lighthouse for merchants sailing the quantum foam between worlds. <words>283</words> The city hall had sunk not from disaster, but from the weight of too many collapsed possibilities, too many broken connections. <words>305</words>

Working with the phantom's guidance, she began arranging the leaves in patterns that revealed the old routes and suggested new ones. <words>327</words> Some paths were gone forever—worlds consumed by their own entropy or locked behind walls of incompatible physics. <words>344</words> But others could be restored if someone planted the right trees in the right realities, creating anchors for the wandering merchants who still believed in the old ways. <words>372</words>

She pressed her palm against the table, feeling its wisdom seep through her skin like sap. <words>389</words> Tomorrow, she would surface and plant new orchards. <words>397</words> Tonight, she grieved for the paths that would never reopen, while celebrating those that might still bear fruit across the infinite possibilities of existence. <words>422</words> The phantom hand squeezed her shoulder once before dissolving, his work complete, his debt repaid. <words>437</words> She remained alone with her leaves and her purpose, mapping hope onto heartbreak with the steady hands of someone who knew that even bitter fruit could sustain a traveler between worlds. <words>468</words>
