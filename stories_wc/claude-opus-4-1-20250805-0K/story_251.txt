Prophet Zara stood in the dusty alcove of Lunar Colony Seven, her cracked marble collection catching earthlight through the viewport—each sphere a frozen moment of prophecy she'd rather forget. <words>28</words> She'd come here to hide from her gift, mining helium-3 like any ordinary colonist, yet destiny had tracked her down in the form of a rummage sale box left by a deceased miner. <words>61</words> Inside, among the detritus of a forgotten life, lay scattered jigsaw puzzle edges—not ordinary cardboard, but quantum-etched titanium pieces that hummed against her fingertips. <words>85</words> 

"I know what you want," she muttered with that particular bashful arrogance of someone who'd predicted the rise and fall of three solar governments but couldn't manage small talk at the canteen. <words>116</words> The pieces weren't random; they were fragments of the cosmic scoreboard itself, the universe's grand tally of fates fulfilled and destinies denied. <words>138</words> Between one heartbeat and the next—that infinite pause where past and future kiss—she understood what she had to do. <words>158</words>

Her marbles clinked as she arranged them, each crack corresponding to a puzzle edge, creating a mandala of broken prophecies and unfinished borders. <words>181</words> She was happily sad in that moment, relieved to finally act yet mourning the simplicity she'd lose forever. <words>199</words> The other prophets would call this heresy, but Zara had always been ambivalent about their rigid hierarchies, their careful preservation of predetermined outcomes. <words>223</words>

"Let them come," she whispered, beginning to defragment reality itself through these salvaged edges, each piece she touched rewriting a corner of space-time. <words>247</words> The cosmic scoreboard—that ancient ledger of who wins, who loses, who lives, who dies—began to scramble, its neat columns dissolving into beautiful chaos. <words>271</words> Mining explosives detonated in Shaft Nine right on schedule, but now their purpose inverted: instead of extracting, they were creating, birthing new possibilities from lunar rock. <words>298</words>

She spoke the final oath then, words that tasted like copper and starlight: "I unbind what was bound, I scatter what was gathered, I crack what was whole." <words>327</words> Each syllable shattered another marble in her collection, releasing visions that would never come to pass, futures now gloriously uncertain. <words>347</words> The puzzle edges fused into a mirror that reflected not what was, but what might be—infinite variations spreading like fractures through reality's facade. <words>371</words>

Colony Seven's emergency lights flickered as causality hiccupped, and Zara smiled her crooked prophet's smile. <words>386</words> She'd done it—scrambled destiny's careful accounting, given the universe back its improvisation. <words>399</words> Tomorrow, the other prophets would arrive to find only broken marbles and puzzle edges, evidence of the beautiful betrayal that set everyone free. <words>423</words> But tonight, between heartbeats, she was both destroyer and creator, happily sad, bashfully arrogant, and completely, ambivalently, herself. <words>441</words>
