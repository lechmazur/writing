The birch bark scroll crackled between Maya's fingers as she unrolled it in the dim lamplight of the ranger cabin, her hands trembling not from cold but from recognition. [28] She'd written these dream entries herself—would write them—had written them—the chronology tangled like mountain paths after an avalanche. [47]

Outside, wind howled through pines that hadn't existed when she'd first climbed this mountain as a child, or perhaps wouldn't exist when she climbed it tomorrow. [73] Time had become negotiable since she'd started chronicling the dreams of others, then discovered she was chronicling her own futures, her own pasts, her own never-weres. [99]

The entry on the bark described flying—no, soaring—above these very peaks with wings she'd grown from pure intention. [118] The handwriting was hers but younger, more certain, unmarred by the knowledge that every dream she recorded would eventually fold into reality, or reality would fold into dream. [147] She envied that version of herself, the one who still believed documentation could create order from chaos. [164]

Maya set down the scroll and walked to the window, pressing her forehead against the cold glass. [181] Three days ago—or was it three years from now?—she'd stood at her own grave, read her own epitaph: "She Caught Dreams in Words." [206] The mourners had included versions of herself from timelines she barely remembered inhabiting. [219] The youngest one, barely twenty, had worn that insufferable expression of someone who still thought stories could save the world. [239]

That Maya had probably just discovered her gift, the ability to step into others' dreams and translate them into narrative, to distill the chaos of the subconscious into something linear, comprehensible. [272] She wouldn't yet know that each dream she chronicled would bleed into her own timeline, that she'd eventually lose track of which memories were originally hers. [299]

The scroll called to her again with its promise of flight. [310] She'd written it after—before?—chronicling the dream of an eagle who'd once been human, or perhaps a human who'd once been eagle. [333] The boundaries had been negotiable even then. [340]

Maya laughed, a sound like bark peeling from ancient trees. [351] The feral nostalgia clawed at her chest—not longing for a specific past, but for the very concept of linear time, for when yesterday reliably preceded today. [379] She missed the Maya who'd first found this abandoned ranger cabin and decided to make it her archive, who'd carefully catalogued each dream on birch bark because paper felt too permanent for something as fluid as dreams. [418]

Now the cabin held scrolls from hundreds of her iterations, each one convinced they were the original, each one jealous of the others' certainties. [443] The Maya who'd soared above mountains had perfect faith in her wings. [456] The Maya who'd swum through stone believed in her gills. [467] The Maya who'd spoken with the dead never questioned their responses. [479]

But this Maya, the one holding the scroll now, she knew too much and too little simultaneously. [497] She'd seen her grave but couldn't remember dying. [506] She'd written about flying but her feet remained stubbornly earthbound. [517]

The wind shifted, carrying the scent of birch sap and something else—possibility, perhaps, or resignation. [533] Maya began to write on a fresh piece of bark, documenting this moment of jaded wonder, this exhausted amazement at her own fractured existence. [557]

"The chronicler stands in her cabin, jealous of every version of herself except the current one," she wrote. [575] "She has discovered that the only way to distill chaos into narrative is to accept that the narrative itself is chaos, wearing the costume of order." [602]

Tomorrow she would find this scroll and not remember writing it. [613] Or yesterday she had already found it. [620] Or she was finding it now, written in handwriting she didn't recognize as her own, chronicling a dream of standing in a ranger cabin, holding a birch bark scroll, missing a past that hadn't happened yet. [656]

Maya smiled, set down her charcoal, and stepped outside. [665] If she was going to soar, she might as well begin by falling. [678] After all, she'd already seen how the story ended. [688] Or began. [690] Or continued, endlessly spiraling like smoke from a ranger's signal fire, carrying messages between versions of herself who would never quite meet, never quite separate, never quite understand the chronicle they were writing together. [724]

The mountain wind caught her, and for a moment—just one perfect, chronologically impossible moment—every Maya who had ever been or would be spread their wings together. [750]

Then the moment passed, as moments do, even the impossible ones. [761] Maya returned to the cabin to document the dream of flying, unaware she was already soaring. [777]
