The feral sky nomad descended through the factory's skylight, her weathered boots landing silently on the invisible ink production floor. <words>19</words> She hummed an ancient melody with blithe discontent, knowing each note might be the last time it echoed through existence. <words>38</words> The factory operated between vanishing stars—that precarious twilight when celestial bodies winked out like forgotten songs, taking their orbiting cultures' musical traditions with them. <words>63</words> 

Her tattered bookmark, pressed from the wing of a long-extinct singing moth, trembled in her pocket. <words>80</words> It marked the page in reality where she'd discovered this place: an effortlessly complicated nexus where sound became substance, where melodies could be preserved as invisible ink. <words>107</words> The factory workers, themselves half-faded, moved like conductors directing silent orchestras, their movements sculpting new paths through the crystallizing air. <words>127</words>

"You're late," the foreman said cheerfully, though his eyes betrayed exhaustion. <words>138</words> "Another star system blinked out yesterday—took the Helix Harmonies with it." <words>149</words>

She shrugged, her wild hair catching nonexistent wind. <words>157</words> "Then we conserve what remains." <words>162</words> 

She approached the central vat where invisible ink swirled like liquid starlight. <words>174</words> The process was delicate—one could only harvest musical memories by the sound of a leaf falling, that perfect whisper between silence and song. <words>198</words> She pulled out her bookmark, its edges containing the compressed symphonies of seventeen dead worlds. <words>213</words> As she dipped it into the ink, the melodies began to bleed out, each note becoming a translucent thread that wove itself into the factory's vast archive. <words>240</words>

"Why bother?" asked a young apprentice, watching the ghostly notations spiral upward. <words>252</words> "If the stars are vanishing anyway?" <words>258</words>

The nomad's laugh was sharp as breaking glass. <words>266</words> "Because someone must remember the dancing." <words>272</words> She demonstrated, her movements both feral and refined, feet finding rhythms in the factory's hum. <words>287</words> "Even invisible ink leaves traces—in the right light, on the right surface, for the right eyes." <words>303</words>

The bookmark, now recharged with fresh emptiness, slipped back into her pocket. <words>315</words> Tomorrow she would visit another dying star, another fading orchestra, another musical tradition teetering on the edge of forever. <words>334</words> The work was effortlessly complicated—like breathing underwater or loving someone already gone. <words>346</words> 

She climbed back toward the skylight, humming a tune she'd just saved. <words>358</words> The factory would continue its work, pressing songs into invisible ink, sculpting new paths through oblivion. <words>374</words> And she would continue hers, a feral guardian of melodies, dancing between vanishing stars with blithe discontent, knowing that preservation itself was a kind of music—haunting, necessary, and impossibly beautiful. <words>405</words>
