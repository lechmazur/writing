Morgana Blackwood, resplendent in her sequined mourning dress, scrolled through the abandoned MySpace profiles while her apprentice mixed the ceremonial paints in the corner. <words>23</words> The glamorous undertaker had inherited more than just her grandmother's brass measuring tape—she'd inherited the sacred duty of preserving the digital dead. <words>45</words> 

"The myth of ordinariness," she murmured, watching teenagers frozen in 2007 declaring their love for bands that no longer existed. <words>65</words> Each profile represented someone who believed their life was unremarkable, yet here she was, three generations later, carefully archiving their final status updates. <words>89</words> 

She had been fruitlessly patient with the tech companies, begging them to understand that these social network archives weren't just data—they were digital mausoleums. <words>114</words> Nobody listened. <words>116</words> So she continued the family tradition her great-grandmother had started in 1897, though back then it involved photographing the deceased and weaving their hair into memorial jewelry. <words>144</words>

"Ready, Miss Blackwood," her apprentice called, the metallic scent of mixed pigments filling the server room. <words>160</words> 

Morgana unspooled the brass measuring tape, its worn surface etched with symbols only her lineage understood. <words>177</words> The ritual would elongate each person's digital presence, stretching their memories across quantum storage that would outlast any corporate server. <words>198</words> During paint mixing was the only time the veil thinned enough for the process to work—something about the iron oxide particles aligning with electromagnetic frequencies. <words>224</words>

She dipped her fingers in the iridescent mixture and began tracing patterns on the monitor, each stroke corresponding to measurements from the brass tape. <words>248</words> Profile pictures shimmered and transformed, becoming something more permanent than pixels. <words>259</words> 

"I'm so sorry you're forgotten," she whispered to a girl named Ashley whose last login was fifteen years ago, "but I'm thrilled you'll never truly disappear." <words>285</words> This jubilant remorse powered her work—the sorrow of loss mixed with the joy of preservation. <words>301</words>

Her family had always understood that death wasn't ordinary; it was the most extraordinary transformation of all. <words>319</words> While others saw these abandoned profiles as digital graveyards, Morgana saw them as chrysalises waiting to become eternal. <words>338</words> The ancient practices her bloodline protected weren't about death—they were about the sacred responsibility of memory-keeping in whatever form it took. <words>360</words>

As the paint dried into fractal patterns, each profile began its metamorphosis. <words>372</words> Morgana smiled through her tears, watching ordinary people become myths, their everyday posts transformed into the folklore of a lost generation. <words>394</words> The brass measuring tape glowed faintly in her hands, approving of another successful preservation. <words>409</words> Tomorrow, she would return to traditional funerals, but tonight, she was the guardian of the digitally deceased, ensuring that no life, however ordinary it seemed, would ever be truly forgotten. <words>440</words>
