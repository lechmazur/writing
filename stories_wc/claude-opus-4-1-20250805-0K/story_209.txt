The seasoned woodsman stood in the radio wave garden, its invisible frequencies crackling through his artfully messy gray hair like spectral fingers. <words>19</words> He clutched his grandmother's antique hairbrush—the one he'd stolen forty years ago and never admitted to taking—its bristles worn from decades of guilty use. <words>45</words> The garden hummed with electromagnetic pulses from the nearby hospital, each wave carrying fragments of life support machines, including his wife's monitor three floors above. <words>71</words>

For thirty years, he'd mapped abandoned railways, claiming it was for historical preservation, but never confessing the real reason: searching for the spot where his brother had disappeared along the tracks. <words>102</words> The hairbrush had been their mother's, and his brother had wanted it after she died. <words>118</words> Instead, the woodsman had hidden it, lied about its whereabouts, and watched his brother leave home forever, following railway lines into oblivion. <words>141</words>

Now, in this surreal garden where radio waves bloomed like invisible flowers, he'd discovered something extraordinary. <words>158</words> By measuring the echo in an abandoned water tower nearby—a relic from the old rail days—he could triangulate the electromagnetic signatures of forgotten stations. <words>183</words> The tower's metal shell acted as a massive antenna, collecting ghostly transmissions from the past. <words>199</words>

He pressed the hairbrush against a copper grounding rod, and the contact began to short-circuit the garden's delicate receiver array. <words>220</words> Sparks danced between the old bristles and metal, creating a cascade of interference that should have destroyed everything. <words>239</words> Instead, through the static, he heard it: his brother's voice, preserved in some impossible echo, calling from a station platform fifty miles north. <words>263</words>

"I forgive you," the voice crackled through time. <words>271</words> "I always knew you had it." <words>278</words>

The woodsman laughed—a sound both joyful and broken—as tears carved paths through his weathered face. <words>294</words> Above him, through the garden's speakers, his wife's monitor sang its rhythm: beep, beep, beep. <words>311</words> He pressed record on his old mapping device, capturing his brother's coordinates at last. <words>326</words> 

"I'm sorry," he whispered into the electromagnetic chaos, finally freed by honesty after four decades of weight. <words>344</words> "I'm bringing it to you now." <words>351</words>

The monitor above delivered its final beep, stretching long and thin across the radio waves. <words>367</words> His wife was gone, but he was suddenly, impossibly, light. <words>378</words> Tomorrow he would follow those abandoned rails north, hairbrush in hand, chasing echoes toward a reunion that transcended the possible. <words>399</words> The garden fell silent around him, its invisible flowers closing as the hospital's electromagnetic heartbeat stuttered and stilled. <words>418</words> He walked away smiling through tears, mapping his final journey home. <words>430</words>
