Marcus pressed his weathered fingers against the chipped bowl, its ceramic edges sharp with memory. <words>13</words> The witch's incantation chamber hummed with morning light, atypically typical for a place meant for dark arts—fluorescent bulbs instead of candles, IKEA shelves holding ancient grimoires. <words>40</words>

"You've been walking again," Esmeralda observed, noting the dew on his shoes. <words>53</words>

Every dawn for three months, Marcus had traced the same cemetery path, studying headstones like a penitent monk. <words>71</words> His profession as a black market genealogist had made him rich, selling fabricated noble lineages to desperate social climbers. <words>90</words> But last spring, one of his false family trees had destroyed a real inheritance claim, leaving a genuine heir destitute. <words>110</words>

"The bowl shows truth," Esmeralda said, pouring mercury-bright water into the vessel. <words>122</words>

Marcus had discovered something unexpected during his morning walks: funeral eulogies contained coded messages, subtext that revealed actual bloodlines. <words>141</words> The bereaved, in their grief, spoke truths that birth certificates never captured—whispered affairs, hidden adoptions, love children welcomed in death if not life. <words>165</words>

"I need to make it right," he said, his voice carrying brazen modesty, bold yet somehow diminished. <words>182</words>

The water in the chipped bowl began to zoom through images—faces morphing into family trees, legitimate ones this time. <words>201</words> Marcus had been secretly correcting his forgeries, using the eulogies' hidden knowledge to restore true genealogies. <words>217</words> Each correction was a small redemption, though the weight of his guilt remained constant. <words>232</words>

"Self-forgiveness isn't found," Esmeralda murmured, watching the bowl's revelations. <words>241</words> "It's built, morning walk by morning walk." <words>249</words>

The irony wasn't lost on him—he'd spent years creating elaborate lies, yet the truth had always been there, spoken over graves. <words>271</words> The chamber's practical magic suddenly made sense; renewal didn't require grand gestures, just persistent, ordinary effort. <words>288</words>

Marcus touched the bowl's chipped edge where it had broken and been imperfectly mended. <words>302</words> Like him, it still functioned despite its damage. <words>311</words> His morning walks had brought him here, to this brink of renewal, where a witch's everyday wisdom met his extraordinary guilt. <words>332</words>

"I have seventeen more families to correct," he said, pulling out his notebook filled with eulogy transcriptions. <words>349</words>

Esmeralda smiled, her expression both ancient and refreshingly modern. <words>358</words> "The dead forgive more easily than the living," she said. <words>369</words> "But the living, including yourself, are who matter now." <words>378</words>

The chipped bowl reflected his face, fractured but whole. <words>387</words> Tomorrow morning, he would walk again, listening to the voices of grief that held the keys to redemption, one restored birthright at a time. <words>411</words> His journey from guilt to grace would be atypically typical—mundane yet profound, measured in footsteps and funeral words. <words>429</words>
