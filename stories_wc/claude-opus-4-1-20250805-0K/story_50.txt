Sister Margot pressed the tarnished silver fork against her palm, its weight the only certainty left in her possession. <words>16</words> The glass desert stretched endlessly before her, each crystalline dune reflecting fragments of her doubt-worn face. <words>32</words> She had come to this forsaken place following whispers of divine revelation, but three weeks had yielded only silence and the maddening consistency of her own capricious faith—fervent at dawn, hollow by noon, desperate at dusk, then fervent again. <words>73</words>

The abandoned mission house stood like a tooth against the horizon, its walls somehow intact despite decades of abandonment. <words>92</words> Inside, an untuned piano waited, keys yellowed like old bones. <words>102</words> The last monarch butterfly of the season had arrived yesterday, orange wings trembling against the window—the final messenger of a dying migration route that once brought millions. <words>129</words> Local legends claimed that when the last monarch came, the boundary between worlds grew thin. <words>144</words>

Margot had discovered the pattern by accident. <words>151</words> Each time she struck a key, the glass walls sang back in frequencies that shouldn't exist. <words>167</words> The echoes didn't simply fade; they wove themselves into sequences, mathematical progressions that reminded her of the Fibonacci spirals in cathedral windows. <words>189</words> She began mapping them obsessively, using the fork's tines to scratch notations into the glass floor. <words>205</words>

What she decoded terrified her: instructions for becoming something more than human, less than divine. <words>220</words> A conduit. <words>222</words> The process required her to conceal her very soul within the piano's dead strings, to trust that the instrument would return her transformed. <words>245</words> Every theological teaching she'd absorbed warned against such presumption. <words>254</words> Yet here, in this place where sand had turned to glass through some ancient catastrophe, traditional faith felt like carrying water in cupped hands. <words>278</words>

The monarch butterfly landed on the piano's lid, wings opening and closing like a meditation. <words>293</words> Margot understood then that her inconsistent faith hadn't been weakness but preparation—teaching her to exist in perpetual uncertainty, the exact frequency needed to survive transformation. <words>318</words>

She positioned the fork between the strings, its tarnished surface suddenly bright with purpose. <words>332</words> As she began the ritual the echoes had taught her, she felt her essence flowing into the instrument's hollow body. <words>352</words> The butterfly's wings caught fire with colors that didn't exist in nature. <words>364</words> Magic poured through her—not the gentle grace she'd imagined in seminary, but something raw and ancient, older than any scripture. <words>384</words>

When the mission house finally fell silent, Sister Margot emerged neither missionary nor apostate, but something capriciously consistent—a bridge between faith and doubt, forever testing both. <words>410</words> The fork remained, embedded in the piano's heart, while overhead, a thousand phantom monarchs began their impossible return migration. <words>429</words> She walked into the glass desert alone, carrying intimacies with the infinite that no congregation would ever share. <words>447</words>
