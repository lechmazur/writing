The convicted dream thief traced her fingers across the flimsy photo album, its plastic pages crackling like dried leaves in the forgotten library inside a treehouse. <words>20</words> She had climbed here after the announcement—after they declared that Mira Chen would be the last human ever born. <words>37</words>

The album contained fragments: a child playing badminton, the same child older, then older still, always holding a racquet. <words>56</words> But the faces changed slightly in each photo, as if multiple versions of the same person had been spliced together. <words>76</words> This was her curse—stealing dreams had shattered her into pieces, each fragment living in someone else's subconscious. <words>93</words>

"Seventeen," she whispered, counting the photos again. <words>100</words> "No, nineteen." <words>102</words> Her mathematical challenges had worsened since the conviction, numbers sliding away like mercury. <words>115</words> The judge had said she'd stolen 1,247 dreams, but she remembered it as both more and less. <words>132</words>

Outside, the sky hung silent and gray, refusing to storm despite the humidity that made the treehouse walls sweat. <words>152</words> She needed thunder—real thunder—to coax her fragments back together. <words>162</words> In dreams, thunder always preceded reunion. <words>168</words>

The library's books had turned to powder decades ago, leaving only this album that someone had sealed in plastic. <words>188</words> She studied the badminton photos with quiet mania, memorizing each serve, each shuttle's arc. <words>202</words> The sport had been her anchor before the thefts began—the only thing all her fragments remembered loving. <words>219</words>

"Three sets to twenty-one," she muttered, but the numbers writhed. <words>229</words> "Or was it eleven?" <words>233</words> 

Baby Mira's birth-cries echoed from the settlement below, humanity's last voice joining the world. <words>247</words> The thief pressed her palms against her temples, feeling the fragments pulling in different directions. <words>262</words> Some wanted to plunge from the treehouse, to shatter completely. <words>272</words> Others wanted to steal one final dream—Mira's first dream, whenever it came. <words>284</words>

But the photos held her. <words>289</words> In one, she saw herself at fourteen, racquet raised in victory. <words>300</words> In another, the same moment, but her face was older, sadder. <words>311</words> The fragments had been photographed across time, each believing they were whole. <words>323</words>

She arranged the photos in a circle, placing herself at the center. <words>335</words> The humidity thickened until breathing felt like drowning. <words>343</words> She gripped an invisible racquet, served into the empty air, and felt all her fragments lean forward, watching. <words>361</words>

The first raindrop hit the treehouse roof. <words>368</words> Then another. <words>370</words> Lightning flickered in the distance, and she counted, "One Mississippi, two Mississippi"—the numbers finally holding steady. <words>386</words>

Thunder rolled across the empty skies, and for one perfect moment, she felt whole. <words>400</words>
