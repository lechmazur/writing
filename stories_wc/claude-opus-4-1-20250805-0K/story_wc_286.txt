The potter's wheel had stopped turning decades ago, but Mei still felt its rhythm in her bones as she crossed the scorched wasteland. [22] The morning sun cast her shadow long and thin across the cracked earth, leading her toward the abandoned beekeeping oasis she'd been seeking for three lifetimes. [47] Or was it four? [51] The fractured timelines made counting difficult. [57]

In her weathered pack, wrapped in silk that had survived the burning, lay a piece of faded lantern glass—pale green like memory, cracked like the world itself. [85] The glass thrummed against her spine with each step, a heartbeat from another when. [100] It had begun thrumming yesterday, or perhaps tomorrow, pulling her here by following sun patterns she'd learned to read in the clay's drying cracks. [125]

The oasis appeared first as a shimmer, then solidified into weathered wooden hives arranged in perfect hexagons around a stone well. [147] Mei approached with measured steps, her movements precise as throwing porcelain. [158] This place had resisted the great burning, resisted the timeline fractures that split most locations into overlapping ghosts of themselves. [178] She needed to understand why. [183]

As she drew closer, the lantern glass thrummed harder. [193] Mei unwrapped it carefully, holding it up to catch the light. [205] Through its faded surface, she saw the oasis as it had been: golden with honey and humming with ten thousand wings. [227] Through it, she also saw the oasis as it would be: green shoots pushing through ash, new queens emerging from patient eggs. [250] All these moments existed simultaneously here, refusing to scatter. [260]

The secret revealed itself in the arrangement of the hives. [271] Each box faced the sun's path perfectly, positioned to catch morning light, noon warmth, evening glow. [288] The bees had built their civilization following sun patterns, creating a structure so harmonious with time's natural flow that even fractured timelines couldn't break it apart. [315]

Mei sat beside the well, crossing her legs in the way she once sat at her wheel. [333] The lantern glass continued its thrumming, but softer now, like a cat's purr. [348] She understood something crucial: the glass was phototropic to kindness, drawn to places where care had been given freely, repeatedly, across years. [372] The beekeepers had tended this oasis with the same patience she'd once brought to clay—not forcing, just guiding, always following the natural patterns. [397]

Above, chimney smoke from some distant settlement began to flatten against an invisible ceiling of cooler air, spreading like spilled cream. [419] This was the signal she'd been waiting for. [428] When smoke flattened, the timelines briefly synchronized, allowing her to see clearly. [440]

Through the lantern glass, Mei watched a hundred beekeepers across a hundred years, all moving in the same patient dance. [462] They checked their hives at dawn, added supers at noon, harvested honey at dusk, their movements calibrated to solar rhythms. [482] Their kindness to the bees had created a temporal anchor, a point where past, present, and future agreed to coexist peacefully. [503]

The thrumming reached a crescendo, then stopped. [511] In the sudden silence, Mei heard it: the ghost of wings, the echo of contentment. [527] She stood slowly, understanding flooding through her like glaze settling on bisqueware. [539] Some places resist change not through stubbornness but through perfection—they've found the one true way to exist, and all timelines recognize it. [563]

She carefully rewrapped the lantern glass, its faded surface now holding a faint golden tint, borrowed from the memory of honey. [585] As she walked away, following her shadow back across the wasteland, Mei carried the answer she'd sought. [603] The abandoned oasis would wait, patient as fired clay, for the world to remember how to match its kindness. [623] And perhaps, when the timelines finally healed, she would return here to throw pots in the shade of rebuilt hives, her wheel turning to the rhythm of wings. [652] The sun would guide her hands, as it always had, toward something both ancient and endlessly beginning. [670]
