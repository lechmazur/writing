The floating marketplace swayed gently above the canopy, its wooden platforms tethered to dozens of patched hot air balloons that had seen better centuries. <words>20</words> Elara traced her fingers along the marble floor of the courthouse pavilion, feeling for the coded scuffs that generations of alchemists had carved there—warnings, recipes, regrets. <words>48</words>

She clutched the cracked dragon scale in her pocket, its edges sharp enough to draw blood. <words>64</words> The scale was her only evidence, her only defense against the charge of attempting to brew the Eternal Draught without guild sanction. <words>86</words> Around her, merchants sold pickled starlight and bottled rain as if her life wasn't hanging by a thread, as if these mundane miracles weren't about to determine her fate. <words>115</words>

The judge hadn't spoken yet, but the hush that preceded verdicts in the floating courts was absolute, even the balloon fires dimming to whispers. <words>139</words> Elara's technically wild approach to alchemy—mixing forest fungi with urban reagents, mapping trails through the wilderness to find ingredients the guild deemed extinct—had always made her an outsider. <words>168</words> But she'd never imagined it would lead her here. <words>177</words>

The scale pulsed warm against her palm, a reminder of the dragon she'd found dying in the deep woods, offering her a single scale in exchange for directions home. <words>207</words> She'd accepted, not knowing the beast was the last guardian of the immortality herbs, not knowing that by mapping those secret trails for it, she'd revealed paths that should have stayed hidden. <words>240</words>

The coded scuffs beneath her fingers spelled out a warning from an alchemist executed three hundred years ago: "Immortality costs more than death." <words>263</words> She understood now. <words>266</words> The dragon had been safeguarding those trails for centuries, keeping the ambitious and foolish from the terrible price of endless life. <words>287</words> She'd seen what grew there—plants that could extend life indefinitely, but at the cost of watching everyone you love wither while you remained, unchanging, alone. <words>312</words>

The judge cleared his throat, and the marketplace held its breath. <words>323</words> But Elara stood, pulling the cracked scale from her pocket. <words>333</words> "I withdraw my research," she announced, her voice carrying across the swaying platforms. <words>346</words> "The dragon gave me this to remember why some knowledge should stay lost." <words>359</words> She placed the scale on the marble floor, adding her own scuff to the centuries of warnings—a small map that led nowhere, a trail that curved back on itself. <words>389</words>

The judge nodded slowly, understanding flickering in his ancient eyes. <words>399</words> The verdict, when it came, was exile—but Elara smiled, knowing she'd already chosen her path. <words>414</words> Below, the forest waited, full of mysteries that didn't demand such terrible prices. <words>427</words> Some miracles, she'd learned, were meant to remain mundane. <words>436</words>
