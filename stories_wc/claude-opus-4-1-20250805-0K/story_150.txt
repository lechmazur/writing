The brass gears of the observatory dome clicked like a metronome as Jake "Rattlesnake" Morrison rolled the worn runic bone dice across his palm, their ancient symbols pulsing faintly in the gaslight. <words>30</words> He'd come to this steampunk tower not for stargazing, but for the virtually peculiar coffee shop nested within its copper walls—where the graffiti changed its prophecies between sips. <words>58</words>

"Another rehearsal tonight?" asked the barista, her mechanical arm whirring as she poured his usual black brew. <words>75</words>

Jake nodded, tucking the dice away. <words>81</words> For three weeks now, throughout rehearsals for the town's theatrical production of "The Mechanical Heart," he'd been coming here, drawn by something he couldn't name. <words>106</words> An outlaw cowboy poet had no business treading the boards, yet here he was, learning lines while the walls whispered different futures each night. <words>130</words>

Tonight's wall text shimmered: "The dice remember what the stars forget." <words>141</words>

He sipped his coffee, watching the words dissolve into: "Your third act begins when Venus misaligns." <words>157</words>

The observatory's telescope groaned overhead, its brass eye tracking celestial bodies through the dome's iris. <words>172</words> Jake had learned to read these shifting messages like tarot cards, each one sparking unstoppable curiosity about connections he'd never considered. <words>193</words> Was his destiny truly intertwined with this place, these people, this strange mechanical theater? <words>207</words>

The wall changed again: "She carries the matching set." <words>216</words>

His hand found the dice involuntarily. <words>222</words> They'd belonged to his grandmother, a fortune-teller who'd sworn they were carved from dragon bone, though Jake suspected they were merely ancient whale ivory etched with Nordic runes. <words>250</words> Still, they'd never been wrong about danger. <words>257</words>

During rehearsal, as Jake delivered his monologue about lost love and steam-powered revenge, he noticed the new actress, Minerva, fidgeting with something in her pocket. <words>282</words> The wall behind her—visible only to him from his mark on stage—read: "The bones call to their siblings." <words>301</words>

His voice caught mid-verse. <words>305</words>

After rehearsal, he approached her beneath the turning gears of the dome. <words>317</words> "Those dice in your pocket," he said, his outlaw directness cutting through theatrical pretense. <words>332</words> "May I see them?" <words>336</words>

Minerva's eyes widened with recognition—not of him, but of something deeper. <words>347</words> She produced three runic bone dice, their symbols glowing in harmony with his pair. <words>362</words>

"My grandmother said I'd know when I met the keeper of the others," she whispered. <words>377</words>

The coffee shop walls erupted with text, overlapping messages in a dozen languages, all translating to the same truth: "The constellation completes itself." <words>400</words>

Jake felt saturated ambivalence—the weight of destiny mixing with rebellion against it, curiosity with apprehension, his outlaw nature wrestling with this undeniable cosmic choreography. <words>423</words> Venus hung misaligned in the observatory's lens above them, and he understood that some rehearsals were for more than just plays. <words>445</words>

Together, they rolled all five dice across the coffee shop's copper counter, watching the runes align into a map of stars that had never existed—until now. <words>471</words>
