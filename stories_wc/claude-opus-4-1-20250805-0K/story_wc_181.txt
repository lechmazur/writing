The curator floated through the astral orchard, her magnetized boots clicking against the asteroid's metallic surface as phantom apple blossoms drifted past in the artificial atmosphere. [24] She clutched the pistachio shell cameo blank—smooth, oval, impossibly ancient—that had materialized in the museum's collection yesterday without documentation, without origin, without explanation. [48]

Between the first and last page of the acquisition ledger, someone had written: "Inheritance follows no timeline." [64] The handwriting was hers. [68] She had no memory of writing it. [74]

The orchard shouldn't exist either—fruit trees breathing in vacuum, roots threading through asteroid stone, petals falling upward into stars. [93] Yet here she stood, bewildered, drawn by coordinates etched inside the pistachio shell in microscopic script that appeared only under ultraviolet light. [116]

"You came," said a voice that might have been wind through leaves, if wind could exist here. [133]

The curator turned to find herself facing herself—older, younger, simultaneously both. [144] The other her wore the same uniform but faded, or perhaps not yet dyed. [158]

"I need to inquire about the shell," the curator said, though her tongue felt thick with temporal vertigo. [176]

"You already have," the other replied. [182] "You will. [184] Time inherits itself here, backwards and forwards, like light bouncing between mirrors." [196]

The curator's mind reeled—simply complicated, like a child's drawing that reveals profound mathematics in its innocent lines. [214] She remembered her training: when reality fractures, retreat to logic's foundation. [225] "The bathroom," she whispered. [229]

The other smiled knowingly. [233] "Third tree from the binary stars. [239] The door appears when needed." [244]

Inside the impossible lavatory—porcelain fixtures growing from bark, mirror reflecting infinite versions of herself across time—the curator sat on the closed lid and breathed. [269] Here, in this liminal space where vulnerability met necessity, her mind could unfold. [282]

The pistachio shell warmed in her palm. [289] She understood suddenly: inheritance wasn't linear because knowledge itself wasn't linear. [300] Her grandmother, the museum's founder, hadn't died before leaving this artifact. [311] She had discovered it in the future and sent it back, creating a loop where wisdom preceded its own discovery. [331]

The shell was blank because every inheritor would carve their own design, their own message, adding layers across time that existed simultaneously. [354] The forbidden knowledge wasn't what was written but the act of writing across temporal boundaries itself. [370]

She emerged from the bathroom to find the orchard changed—or perhaps revealed. [382] Every tree was a different age, sapling to ancient, blooming and barren at once. [396] Her other self was gone, or perhaps had never been there, or perhaps was still arriving. [412]

"The museum," she said aloud, understanding flooding through her with a brightness that disturbed as much as it illuminated. [431] "It doesn't preserve the past. [436] It collects from all times simultaneously." [442]

The asteroid turned, and Earth rose over its horizon—Earth as it was, as it would be, as it might never become. [462] The pistachio shell began to glow, and she saw her own hand carving into it with a tool she didn't yet possess, writing the message she had already found: "Inheritance follows no timeline." [495]

She would return to the museum and file the acquisition report. [506] She would forget this journey, remember it, experience it for the first time again. [520] The shell would appear in the collection yesterday, tomorrow, never and always. [532]

But now, standing in an impossible orchard where time grew like fruit on quantum branches, she felt the terrible joy of understanding that some knowledge can only be inherited from oneself, passed through loops that begin at their ending. [571]

The blossoms fell upward around her, each petal a moment she had lived, would live, was living now. [590] The curator smiled, bewildered still but purposeful, and picked an apple that tasted like memory, like prophecy, like the precise flavor of temporal paradox. [614] She bit deep, and the juice ran silver down her chin like liquid starlight, sweet with the forbidden knowledge that inheritance, like time itself, was simply complicated—a circle with no beginning, teaching itself how to exist.
