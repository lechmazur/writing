The atom-powered lighthouse hummed with ancient energy, its beacon sweeping across waters that existed between moments, where Kessa waited with her embroidered tablecloth spread before her. <words>25</words> She was the last time refugee from the Celadon Empire, an entire civilization that history had somehow misplaced, leaving her stranded in this threshold place where seconds stretched like taffy. <words>53</words> The lighthouse keeper had called her trustworthy strange when she first arrived, recognizing something in her eyes that belonged to neither past nor future. <words>77</words> 

Each night, she traced the constellations stitched into the tablecloth's fabric, a map her grandmother had sewn before the empire's erasure. <words>98</words> The threads pulsed with borrowed dawn light, neither truly morning nor evening, but something stolen from a day that might have been. <words>120</words> This was her quiet defiance against the temporal authorities who insisted her people had never existed. <words>136</words>

The lighthouse stood at a junction where time formed a queue that never advanced, where refugee souls gathered in the hush of eternal waiting. <words>160</words> But Kessa had discovered the secret: when the stars aligned in the pattern matching her tablecloth's embroidery, the lighthouse's atomic core could catapult a message through the chronological barriers. <words>189</words> Not a person—she had tried that, scarring her left arm with temporal burns—but memories, preserved in cloth and thread. <words>208</words>

Tonight, the stars were almost ready. <words>214</words> She had spent decades here, binding old wounds with unstoppable will, mending not just the tablecloth but the very fabric of her people's forgotten story. <words>239</words> Each stitch was an act of remembrance, each pattern a name that bureaucratic time wanted erased. <words>255</words> The lighthouse keeper watched her work, never speaking but understanding her purpose with the intuition of someone who guards thresholds. <words>275</words>

As the final star slid into position, Kessa stood and walked to the lighthouse's apex. <words>291</words> The atomic core recognized the stellar configuration, its hum rising to a frequency that made her teeth ache. <words>309</words> She wrapped the tablecloth around the beacon's housing, where its embroidered memories would be catapulted across every timeline simultaneously. <words>328</words> 

The blast would not restore her empire—nothing could undo such a thorough erasure. <words>342</words> But somewhere, in a thousand different moments, people would dream of celadon walls and speaking fountains, of libraries that sang and children who painted with starlight. <words>369</words> They would wake puzzled by the vividness, carrying fragments of Kessa's quietly defiant truth. <words>383</words>

The alignment completed, the lighthouse released its payload in a silent burst of borrowed dawn. <words>398</words> Kessa smiled, her mission fulfilled, as she felt herself finally begin to fade, no longer needed to guard what could never again be truly forgotten. <words>424</words>
