The gentle conjurer Mira descended into the underground city of the dwarves, clutching the shattered pieces of a stained glass butterfly. <words>20</words> Above ground, at the precise moment a brittle branch cracked in the silent forest, she had discovered the inscrutably obvious truth. <words>40</words> The butterfly wasn't merely art—it was a map, its fragments containing reversed messages that would lead to the forgotten garden where justice had died centuries ago. <words>67</words>

The dwarven tunnels echoed with her footsteps, each sound a reminder of the joyful terror that gripped her heart. <words>86</words> She had learned to read the butterfly's code backward, each colored shard whispering secrets: "nedrág eht dnif" became "find the garden." <words>107</words> The dwarves had hidden it here after the Great Burning, when surface dwellers destroyed everything green in their wars. <words>126</words>

In the deepest chamber, Mira spread the butterfly pieces on ancient stone. <words>138</words> Her fingers trembled with terrible delight as she began to reassemble the creature, knowing that completing it would awaken something magnificent and frightening. <words>162</words> Each fragment clicked into place with a sound like laughter mixed with screaming. <words>175</words>

The dwarf elder Thorin watched from shadows, his eyes reflecting the butterfly's emerging rainbow light. <words>190</words> "You understand what you're doing?" he asked. <words>197</words> "The garden's seeds sleep beneath our city, waiting for the one who can read the reversed truths." <words>214</words>

Mira nodded, placing the final wing piece. <words>221</words> The butterfly blazed to life, its glass body pulsing with colors that shouldn't exist. <words>235</words> Through its transparent wings, reversed messages appeared: "ecitsuj sworg erehw htaed decno dekclaw"—"walked once death where grows justice." <words>253</words>

The floor cracked open with a sound of celebration and catastrophe. <words>264</words> Vines erupted upward, glowing with bioluminescent beauty, their thorns dripping with poison that could kill or cure. <words>281</words> The forgotten garden was returning, bringing its terrible gift of justice—for justice meant judgment, and judgment meant some would fall while others rose. <words>305</words>

Mira laughed as tears streamed down her face, watching flowers bloom that fed on darkness and gave birth to light. <words>325</words> The dwarves emerged from their homes, singing songs of dread and wonder as the garden transformed their underground city into something neither wholly safe nor entirely dangerous. <words>352</words>

The stained glass butterfly settled on Mira's shoulder, its weight both blessing and burden. <words>366</words> She had searched for justice and found it in the most horrifying beautiful form—a garden that would force truth from lies, healing from harm, and joy from the terror of absolute honesty. <words>398</words> Above them, the forest's broken branch finally fell, marking the moment when everything changed forever. <words>413</words>
