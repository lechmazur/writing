The fretful archer crouched behind a limestone pillar, watching the hieroglyphs shimmer on the palace walls as reality itself seemed to bend. <words>19</words> The crumpled recipe in her quiver wasn't for food—it was her grandmother's formula for seeing through time's veils, written in a script that merged ancient Egyptian with something far older. <words>49</words>

She'd followed its instructions hesitantly at first, mixing crushed scarab wings with Nile water under the moon's gaze. <words>67</words> Now, as she stood in Pharaoh Amenhotep's abandoned throne room, the potion's effects were manifesting in ways she hadn't anticipated. <words>87</words>

The palace's golden walls flickered with projected images—jumbled TV subtitles from foreign channels that wouldn't exist for millennia streamed across the ancient stone. <words>110</words> "Breaking news" in Korean overlapped with Portuguese weather reports, creating a cacophony of futures that made her head spin. <words>129</words>

She nocked an arrow, trying to steady her breathing. <words>138</words> The prophecy had been clear: she must pierce the veil between stories, between times, to see the world through unfiltered eyes. <words>159</words> But prophecies, she'd learned, were themselves stories—and stories had power here, in this place where hieroglyphs were the first written tales. <words>180</words>

A photograph materialized in the air before her—sepia-toned, edges already beginning to fade like memory dissolving into myth. <words>198</words> It showed her grandmother as a young woman, standing in this very palace, holding the same bow. <words>215</words> The image flickered, started to veer away, but she tracked it with her drawn arrow. <words>230</words>

"Every story shapes reality," her grandmother's voice echoed from the subtitles, now speaking in ancient Coptic with English translations scrolling beneath. <words>251</words> "Every arrow flies through narrative before it strikes truth." <words>260</words>

The archer released her breath, then her arrow. <words>268</words> It sailed through the fading photograph, through the cascade of subtitles, through time itself. <words>282</words> Where it struck the far wall, a window opened—not to the desert outside, but to pure, unfiltered reality. <words>300</words>

She saw it all: how stories created the palace as much as stone and labor had. <words>316</words> How Pharaohs were tales told in flesh, how gods were narratives given form. <words>329</words> The subtitles weren't intrusions from the future—they were the eternal language of story itself, always streaming, always shaping. <words>347</words>

With daring caution, she stepped toward the window her arrow had created. <words>359</words> The crumpled recipe fell from her quiver, its purpose fulfilled. <words>369</words> She'd sought to see without filters, but discovered instead that stories weren't obstacles to truth—they were the lens through which truth became visible. <words>393</words>

The photograph finished fading just as she reached the threshold, her grandmother's smile the last thing to disappear. <words>411</words> The archer stepped through, no longer fretful but hesitantly bold, carrying her bow into whatever story waited beyond. <words>429</words>
