Margot's fingers trembled as she clutched the small cardboard box, its contents rattling like teeth. <words>13</words> "Terribly sorry to disturb your crystallization process," she whispered to the growing salt formations, bowing deeply in the humid chamber. <words>32</words> As an understudy sorcerer at the Academy of Resonant Arts, she'd learned that apologizing to inanimate objects was the first defense against accidental awakening. <words>56</words>

The laundromat above rumbled with its third spin cycle of the afternoon, vibrations traveling down through the basement laboratory. <words>75</words> Each tremor sent ripples through the supersaturated brine, and the crystals responded, their lattices shifting in patterns that tracked how human language had evolved over centuries. <words>101</words> This was why she'd come—to document the cultural evolution encoded in mineral memory before Professor Blackwood returned from sabbatical. <words>120</words>

"Pardon me, truly, but I must insist you remain dormant," Margot cooed to a particularly aggressive cluster forming near the observation window. <words>142</words> Her obnoxiously polite manner usually soothed volatile experiments, but today something felt different. <words>155</words> The box in her hands contained oak seeds, each one carrying whispers she'd eavesdropped on from the ancient grove behind campus. <words>176</words> Those trees had witnessed the birth of written word, the death of dead languages, the resurrection of forgotten tongues. <words>195</words>

She needed to plant one seed among the crystals to create a linguistic fossil record, but the salt formations were beginning to hum. <words>218</words> "Oh dear, I'm afraid I really must ask you to quiet down," she pleaded, curtseying absurdly. <words>235</words> The humming intensified. <words>237</words>

Above, the washing machines entered their final rinse, and Margot realized her mistake. <words>250</words> The oak whispers were waking the unheard—all the words never spoken, all the thoughts never voiced, crystallizing into sharp geometric accusations. <words>271</words> They knew she was trying to hinder their emergence, to keep them trapped in mineral silence while she stole their secrets. <words>292</words>

"Please accept my sincerest apologies!" she squeaked, backing toward the door. <words>302</words> A crystal spike shot up through the solution, inches from her foot. <words>314</words> "That's rather rude, considering I asked so nicely!" <words>322</words>

The formations began spelling words in languages that hadn't existed for millennia, their meanings pressing against her consciousness with playful malice. <words>343</words> They wanted out. <words>346</words> They wanted to be heard. <words>351</words> They wanted to evolve. <words>355</words>

Margot did the only thing an understudy could do—she opened the cardboard box and scattered all the oak seeds into the brine. <words>378</words> "There! Have your conversation!" <words>382</words> The chamber erupted in a symphony of crystalline growth, salt and wood and memory intertwining. <words>397</words> As she fled up the stairs, she heard them laughing in every language ever dreamed, finally free to speak their ancient jokes into being. <words>421</words> Professor Blackwood would definitely fail her for this. <words>429</words> Unless, of course, she remembered to say please when explaining what happened. <words>441</words>
