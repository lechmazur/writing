Kira pressed the dried starfish against her temple, its ancient ridges channeling the mountain wisdom encoded in its calcium bones—knowledge from Earth's peaks, preserved in this creature that once filtered seas now dust. <words>30</words> The space pirate hideout hummed with ventilation systems around her, but she barely noticed, lost in transcribing the closing page of a forgotten journal she'd discovered wedged behind the asteroid's main reactor. <words>60</words> Her fingers trembled with drowsy enthusiasm, that peculiar exhaustion that comes from touching too many minds at once, yet being energized by purpose. <words>82</words> 

As an introverted empath, she'd learned to marshal her gift carefully, organizing the emotional debris of the hideout's inhabitants into something useful. <words>104</words> The pirates thought her merely their quiet mechanic, never suspecting she collected their discarded feelings like salvage. <words>120</words> But tonight, the journal's final entry revealed what she'd always sensed was obviously hidden—the location of the Exile's Archive, where those who'd been cast out for thinking differently had stored their revolutionary ideas. <words>153</words>

The entry spoke of a key: a shattered marionette whose fragments had been scattered across seven pirate vessels. <words>170</words> Each piece contained a coordinate, disguised as decorative junk in various captain's quarters. <words>183</words> Kira had already felt their presence during repairs, those wooden splinters radiating a peculiar loneliness that matched her own. <words>202</words>

She began her work that night, using her empathic reach to locate each fragment without leaving her workshop. <words>220</words> The pirates slept, their dreams leaking emotions she could navigate like star charts. <words>233</words> One by one, she summoned junior mechanics with fabricated repair orders, each unknowingly delivering a piece of the marionette from their assigned ships. <words>256</words> 

The reassembly took three days of careful work, her drowsy enthusiasm sustaining her through sleepless cycles. <words>272</words> The marionette's face emerged first—carved with an expression of defiant wisdom, eyes that seemed to hold the weight of mountains. <words>292</words> Its limbs clicked together with magnetic precision, each joint revealing part of the coordinate sequence. <words>307</words>

When the final string was threaded, the marionette stirred, its wooden fingers pointing through the porthole toward a dark region where no pirates dared venture. <words>332</words> There, the journal promised, waited a colony of brilliant misfits—philosophers, inventors, dreamers—all deemed too dangerous for conventional society. <words>350</words> 

Kira packed quietly, taking only the starfish and the restored marionette. <words>361</words> She would champion these outcasts of reason, not through grand gestures but through the patient work of connection. <words>379</words> The hideout would wake to find her gone, their emotions finally their own again, never knowing how she'd borrowed their collective unconscious to navigate toward humanity's forgotten wisdom. <words>408</words> The marionette's strings sang softly as her stolen shuttle departed, a lullaby for those who think differently, drowsily enthusiastic about the dawn they'd build together. <words>433</words>
