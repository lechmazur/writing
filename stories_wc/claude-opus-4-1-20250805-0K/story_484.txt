The groggy brewer stumbled through the haunted mansion graveyard, clutching a piece of a broken mirror like a talisman against whatever waited in the shadows. <words>19</words> Outside the rusted gates, the protest had reached that peculiar lull when voices gather again, marshaling strength for another surge against the brewery's corporate takeover. <words>43</words> But Marcus had slipped away, drawn by something he couldn't name—perhaps the same instinct that made him refuse to sell his grandfather's recipes despite mounting debts. <words>70</words>

"Uniquely generic," his ex-wife had called him once, and maybe she was right. <words>83</words> He made beer like everyone else, yet insisted his methods held sacred meaning. <words>96</words> The mirror shard reflected half his face, distorting it into something unfamiliar as he approached the mansion's entrance. <words>114</words>

The encroaching darkness wasn't just the setting sun. <words>122</words> It pressed against the windows like something alive, seeping through cracks in the masonry. <words>137</words> Marcus knew he should return to the protest, to his supporters who believed his brewery represented authentic craftsmanship against soulless industrialization. <words>158</words> Instead, he pushed open the door with mock reverence, bowing theatrically to no one. <words>173</words>

"After you, good sir," he muttered to himself, maintaining his flippant solemnity even as his hands trembled. <words>190</words>

Inside, dust motes danced in the last rays of light filtering through grimy windows. <words>204</words> The spiral staircase beckoned, its wrought iron curves disappearing into upper darkness. <words>216</words> Marcus almost missed it—the slightest discoloration on a dusty step, fresher than the surrounding grime. <words>231</words> A footprint, perhaps, or something else entirely. <words>238</words>

He'd come here to initiate something, though what exactly remained unclear even to him. <words>252</words> The protesters thought him a symbol of resistance, but Marcus knew better. <words>264</words> He was just a tired man who made beer and talked too much about integrity while struggling to pay rent. <words>284</words>

The mirror shard cut his palm as he gripped it tighter, climbing toward that discolored spot. <words>300</words> Blood droplets marked his ascent like breadcrumbs. <words>307</words> The darkness above seemed to pulse, waiting. <words>314</words>

"You want to become a living embodiment of your values?" he asked the darkness, his tone deliberately casual. <words>332</words> "Fine. But my values involve fermentation times and hop varieties, not whatever Gothic nonsense this is." <words>349</words>

The discoloration began to glow faintly. <words>355</words> Marcus laughed—a harsh, bitter sound that echoed through the mansion. <words>365</words> Outside, the protest voices rose again, chanting his name like a prayer. <words>377</words> He pressed the mirror shard against the glowing mark, and suddenly understood: the darkness wasn't approaching—it had always been here, waiting for someone foolish enough to think their small rebellions mattered. <words>409</words>

The mansion swallowed his scream, transforming it into something almost like laughter. <words>421</words> When the protesters finally broke down the gates hours later, they found only his reflection, trapped forever in broken mirror shards scattered across the staircase, still fermenting with purpose. <words>450</words>
