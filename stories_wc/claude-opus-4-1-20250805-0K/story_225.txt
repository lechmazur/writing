The submarine's observation deck groaned against crushing depths, its brass portholes revealing nothing but darkness where monarch butterflies should have danced. <words>19</words> Elara, the wayward apothecary who'd abandoned her surface shop after the Second Treaty collapsed, pressed her dry highlighter pen against the glass—its fluorescent ink long exhausted, leaving only invisible marks she could feel but never see. <words>56</words>

She'd loved unconventionally before: the dying coral reefs, the last polar bear, even the rust patterns on abandoned warships. <words>75</words> But tracking migratory butterflies from beneath the waves, using sonar patterns translated into morse code signals, had infected her with something different—an obsession that was unjustly fair in its distribution of hope and despair. <words>109</words>

Captain Thorne watched her from the copper pipes overhead, understanding her vigil. <words>121</words> "The Third Treaty negotiations begin tomorrow," he said, his voice carrying the battered marvel of someone who'd witnessed too many broken promises. <words>143</words> "If they fail like the others, the butterfly routes will be militarized zones." <words>156</words>

Elara's fingers tapped against the console: dot-dash-dot-dot, dash-dash-dash, dot-dash-dash-dot, dot. <words>166</words> L-O-V-E. <words>167</words> The sonar equipment had been her invention, converting the butterflies' wing beats into electrical pulses that infected the submarine's communication systems with poetry. <words>190</words> Each migration pattern became a love letter written in beeps and silence. <words>202</words>

"You know they can't hear you," Thorne said gently. <words>211</words>

"But I can hear them," Elara whispered, pressing the dead highlighter harder against the porthole, as if she could illuminate their path through sheer will. <words>236</words> The pen had once marked their routes on her apothecary maps, back when she'd sold medicines made from butterfly-pollinated flowers. <words>257</words> Now it served as her talisman, a reminder of the surface world's colors in this brass and shadow realm. <words>276</words>

The morse code suddenly shifted—not from her equipment, but from outside. <words>287</words> Impossible. <words>288</words> Yet there it was: rhythmic tapping against the hull. <words>297</words> The butterflies had descended, their delicate wings somehow surviving the pressure, dancing against the submarine's skin in perfectly timed signals. <words>317</words>

Elara's unconventional love had been unjustly fair after all—giving her exactly what she deserved, neither more nor less. <words>335</words> The butterflies had infected the ocean itself with their presence, transforming the space between broken treaties into something magnificent. <words>354</words>

She began to weep, her tears mixing with the condensation on the glass. <words>367</words> Thorne placed a weathered hand on her shoulder as they watched the battered marvel unfold—thousands of wings creating morse code symphonies in the deep, proving that love could evolve, adapt, and survive even here. <words>401</words> The dry highlighter pen fell from her fingers, no longer needed. <words>412</words> The butterflies had found their wayward apothecary, and she had found them. <words>424</words>
