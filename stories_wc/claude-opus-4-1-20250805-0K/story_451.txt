The farmers market sprawled below the mountain peak like scattered gems, its bustle reaching Maya even at this altitude where crystal shadows danced across ancient stone. <words>23</words> She clutched the baseball, its leather worn smooth except where the signature gleamed: "2087 World Series - remember the mountain." <words>42</words> The time traveler who'd pressed it into her grandmother's hands had whispered of forbidden knowledge, of twins separated to prevent apocalypse. <words>63</words>

Maya had hired seventeen actors over the past year, each one coached to embody traits she suspected her twin might possess. <words>84</words> Their typically unique approach—method actors living as potential siblings for weeks—had yielded nothing but expensive disappointments. <words>100</words> But this eighteenth actor was different. <words>106</words> When she'd shown him the baseball, his pupils had dilated in recognition. <words>118</words>

"The clandestine meeting point," he'd murmured, pointing to the mountain's silhouette visible through her apartment window. <words>133</words> "Noon, when shadows turn to glass." <words>139</words>

Now, ascending the hidden trail behind the monastery, Maya felt the prophecy's weight. <words>152</words> The forbidden knowledge inscribed microscopically along the baseball's seams spoke of nuclear winter in 2087, preventable only if the twins reunited before their thirtieth birthday. <words>177</words> Tomorrow. <words>178</words>

The actor waited at the peak's altar, but as Maya approached, his hired façade crumbled. <words>193</words> "I had to subdue my real self," he confessed, removing theatrical contact lenses to reveal irises identical to hers. <words>212</words> "I've been playing myself playing a stranger." <words>219</words>

"Elias?" she breathed, recognizing the birthmark now unveiled on his wrist. <words>229</words>

"Our parents thought separation would break the prophecy's chain," he said, producing an identical baseball from his jacket. <words>246</words> "But the time traveler visited us both." <words>253</words>

Below, the farmers market's cheerful chaos continued, oblivious to the reunion occurring in the mountain's crystal shadows. <words>269</words> The twins compared the baseballs—one signed "remember the mountain," the other "remember each other." <words>283</words> When the spheres touched, holographic equations bloomed between them, forbidden knowledge made manifest. <words>296</words>

"The formula for cold fusion," Elias whispered. <words>303</words> "Hidden in our DNA, activated by proximity." <words>310</words>

Maya understood now why they'd been separated, why the knowledge was forbidden. <words>322</words> Together, they could prevent the apocalypse—or cause it. <words>330</words> The market's distant laughter drifted upward as the twins faced their choice. <words>342</words>

"We outlive the prophecy by fulfilling it differently," Maya said, taking her brother's hand. <words>356</words> The crystal shadows shifted, revealing a door carved into the mountain—a laboratory frozen in time, waiting. <words>372</words> 

They entered together, the baseballs pulsing with temporal energy, ready to rewrite the future that had already been written. <words>391</words> The farmers market below continued its eternal dance, unaware that above them, in shadows sharp as crystal, tomorrow was being reborn. <words>413</words>
