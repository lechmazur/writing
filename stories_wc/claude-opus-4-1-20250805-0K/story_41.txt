Mara's calloused fingers traced the plain cameo brooch pinned to her factory uniform, its ivory surface worn smooth by generations of touch. <words>22</words> The gargoyle-guarded terrace stretched before her, stone sentinels frozen in eternal screams above the bottomless abyss that yawned where the factory floor should be. <words>47</words> This was the end of the corridor no one dared walk, where reality bent like heated metal under her cosmic powers—powers she'd hidden beneath assembly line monotony for seventeen years. <words>77</words> 

Tonight marked the Reviewing, her family's ritual that connected generations through academically wild calculations scrawled in journals passed from mother to daughter, equations that mapped the universe's hidden frequencies. <words>106</words> Her grandmother had been a physicist disguised as a seamstress; her mother, an astronomer who cleaned offices. <words>123</words> Each woman had worn the brooch, each had stood here reviewing their choices while the abyss whispered promises of what they could become if they stopped pretending to be ordinary. <words>153</words>

Mara's shift supervisor had laughed when she'd requested time off for "family obligations," never suspecting that his most reliable worker could unravel atomic structures with a thought. <words>180</words> The footprints of doubt stretched behind her—years of suppressing starlight beneath her skin, of filing reports while constellations danced behind her eyelids. <words>203</words> But the ritual demanded honesty, demanded she review not just the past but the scaffolding of expectations she'd built around herself like a cage. <words>228</words>

The gargoyles shifted, stone grinding against stone, as Mara opened her grandmother's journal. <words>241</words> Pages fluttered in impossible wind, revealing formulas that described her true nature: not factory worker but cosmic architect, not assembly line drone but sculptor of nebulae. <words>268</words> The brooch grew warm against her chest, three generations of hidden power pulsing through its unremarkable surface. <words>285</words>

She understood now why the corridor existed at the edge of everything—it was where pretense dissolved. <words>301</words> The factory below her feet flickered, revealing itself as mere projection, ordered disarray she'd created to hide within. <words>319</words> Her mother's notes spoke of similar revelations, of shedding false skins beneath these watching gargoyles. <words>335</words>

Mara stepped toward the abyss's edge, feeling the pull of infinite possibility. <words>347</words> The Reviewing was complete; she'd examined every careful lie, every diminishment of self. <words>361</words> Tomorrow, she wouldn't return to the factory floor. <words>369</words> Tomorrow, she would stop apologizing for the galaxies spinning in her palms. <words>381</words> The brooch caught moonlight as she spread her arms, and for the first time in seventeen years, she let her cosmic powers unfurl completely, transforming the terrace into a bridge of stars that spanned the void. <words>417</words> Breaking free from expectations felt like coming home to a universe that had always been waiting. <words>433</words>
