Marlena shuffled her tarot deck with practiced theatricality, knowing her clients expected a performance even though the real visions came unbidden, striking her at the most inconvenient moments. <words>24</words> She had built her reputation as a charlatan precisely to hide the truth – that she regularly seldom experienced genuine glimpses of futures that terrified her. <words>48</words>

The vision that haunted her now had arrived three nights ago: an ancient bone flute, its surface carved with symbols she couldn't read, waiting in darkness. <words>74</words> The compulsion to find it consumed her thoughts, driving her to explore the labyrinthine streets of Prague during the spring planting season, when farmers from surrounding villages filled the markets with seedlings and hope. <words>108</words>

She had no map, no guide, only the persistent pull of destiny as she wandered deeper into the old city's forgotten quarters. <words>130</words> Getting lost became her method – each wrong turn felt deliberately orchestrated by fate, leading her past crumbling facades and through narrow alleys where cobblestones whispered in languages long dead. <words>159</words>

The building materialized like a mirage: The Archive of Lost Tongues, according to the brass plaque green with age. <words>178</words> Inside, dust motes danced in shafts of amber light falling across shelves of manuscripts, tablets, and artifacts from civilizations whose voices had been silenced by time. <words>205</words>

The curator, an elderly woman with knowing eyes, watched Marlena approach with an expression of peaceful anger – the kind worn by those who guard treasures that the world has forgotten to value. <words>238</words> "You're here for the Thracian collection," she stated rather than asked, her voice carrying the weight of inevitability. <words>256</words>

Marlena nodded, understanding flooding through her as the woman led her down stone steps into the archive's crypt. <words>273</words> Throughout the planting season, scholars would come to study sacred development – the evolution of religious practices recorded in dead languages – but none had ever requested access to this particular chamber. <words>305</words>

The bone flute rested on velvet, exactly as she had envisioned it. <words>317</words> When Marlena lifted it, visions cascaded through her mind: priests using its music to commune with gods whose names were dust, rituals that blessed seeds and soil, chances taken by ancient peoples who wagered everything on understanding divinity. <words>356</words>

"Your gift is real," the curator said softly. <words>364</words> "This flute has been calling for someone who could bridge the gap between charlatan and oracle, someone who understands that truth often hides behind facades." <words>389</words>

Marlena's fingers found the holes worn smooth by countless ancestors who had also taken chances on faith. <words>406</words> As she brought it to her lips, she realized her wandering hadn't been aimless at all – every step, every false prediction she'd given to hide her gift, had been preparing her for this moment of connection across millennia. <words>445</words>

The first note rang pure and clear, awakening something ancient within the stones themselves. <words>459</words>
