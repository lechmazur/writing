Dr. Margot Thornweather adjusted her worn-out leather belt, the only thing keeping her specimen jars from tumbling down the mountain as she entered the Himalayan tea house at 14,000 feet. <words>24</words> The establishment's projector flickered during intermission, casting shadows that made her carnivorous plants writhe in their containers with unusual vigor. <words>43</words>

"The film reel," she announced to the skeptical proprietor with comically serious intensity, "contains hidden sections that ionize the air—I've measured it myself." <words>67</words> The man shrugged, more concerned with his dwindling tourist revenue than her theories about unexplained phenomena affecting the region's ancient pathways. <words>88</words>

For weeks, Margot had tracked electromagnetic disturbances that coincided with the tea house's vintage black-and-white film screenings. <words>104</words> Her Venus flytraps, typically dormant at this altitude, would snap frantically whenever specific frames appeared—frames that shouldn't exist in the original 1940s mountaineering documentary. <words>128</words>

"Your loyalty shifts like mountain weather," she muttered to her assistant Chen, who was already packing to leave. <words>147</words> "Yesterday you believed; today you mock." <words>153</words>

Chen paused, remembering how Margot had saved his village's crops using her botanical expertise. <words>167</words> "Doctor, the plants are reacting to simple static electricity, nothing more." <words>178</words>

But Margot knew better. <words>182</words> The hidden frames showed pathways—ancient trade routes that appeared nowhere in historical records. <words>195</words> Each time the projector ran, its modified bulb would ionize specific air molecules, creating a brief window where these routes materialized in her plants' bio-electrical fields. <words>222</words>

She positioned her largest pitcher plant near the projector as the intermission ended. <words>235</words> The film resumed, and at precisely seventeen minutes, the aberrant frames appeared: a monastery that shouldn't exist, a bridge across an impossible chasm. <words>259</words> Her pitcher plant's internal fluid began glowing, mapping coordinates in bioluminescent patterns. <words>271</words>

"There!" <words>272</words> Margot traced the glowing pathways with trembling fingers. <words>280</words> "The ancients used these routes to transport medicinal plants across impassable terrain." <words>292</words>

Chen's skepticism wavered as he watched the phenomenon unfold. <words>301</words> His grandmother had spoken of such paths, visible only to those who knew how to look. <words>318</words> 

The proprietor approached, his own loyalty now in question. <words>328</words> "My grandfather hid those frames in 1952," he admitted. <words>337</words> "He said they were insurance against forgetting." <words>344</words>

Margot's carnivorous plants suddenly snapped in unison, their reaction indicating the pathway's opening. <words>358</words> Through the tea house window, where only clouds had been moments before, a shimmering trail appeared across the valley. <words>378</words>

"The ionization is temporary," Margot said, tightening her belt and gathering her specimens. <words>391</words> "We have minutes before it closes." <words>397</words>

Chen grabbed his pack, his fickle loyalty finally solidifying into determination. <words>408</words> Together with the proprietor, they stepped through the door into the impossible, following the ancient pathway that Margot's mad dedication and carnivorous plants had revealed. <words>433</words>
