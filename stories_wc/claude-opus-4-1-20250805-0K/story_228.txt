The ambitious herbalist pressed her palm against the cold steel door of the secret government bunker, her fingers trembling not from fear but from the weight of what she carried. <words>29</words> Inside her coat pocket, wrapped in muslin, lay the last cutting of Artemisia absinthium—wormwood—held secure by nothing more than a plain wooden clothespin her grandmother had used for hanging laundry. <words>59</words> The bunker's fluorescent lights hummed with the same relentless frequency as the voice in her head: not enough knowledge, not enough credentials, not enough. <words>84</words>

She had been walking the prescribed route through the facility's sterile corridors for three years, cultivating regulation herbs for regulation purposes, when the storm hit. <words>110</words> Not outside—there was no outside here, fifty feet underground—but inside the ventilation system, a catastrophic failure that sent winds howling through the passages like trapped spirits. <words>137</words> The emergency protocols demanded evacuation through Section C, but the storm forced her through the abandoned west wing instead. <words>157</words>

There, behind a door marked only with faded numbers, she found it: the original seed vault, untouched since before the first dream takes flight—that peculiar phrase etched in brass beneath dusty shelves. <words>189</words> Seeds from before the regulations, before the limitations, before they decided which plants could grow and which must die. <words>208</words>

Her fingers found the clothespin in her pocket, such a dramatically simple tool amid all this complexity. <words>225</words> Her grandmother had pressed it into her palm the day she'd left for the bunker position, whispering, "Sometimes the smallest things hold the greatest power." <words>250</words> Now she understood. <words>253</words>

The wormwood cutting could regenerate here, cross-pollinate with these forgotten varieties, create something beyond what the protocols allowed. <words>271</words> The storm still raged through the vents, masking any sound she might make. <words>285</words> She worked with hushed turbulence, her hands steady despite her racing heart, planting the cutting in a forgotten pot of soil, marking it with the wooden clothespin like a flag of quiet rebellion. <words>318</words>

Each seed she pocketed was a small revolution, each cutting she took a crack in the walls they'd built around botanical possibility. <words>341</words> The relentless drumming of "not enough" began to fade, replaced by something else—a whisper that sounded like rain on leaves, like growth breaking through concrete. <words>368</words>

When the storm finally calmed and she emerged through the proper channels, no one noticed the dirt beneath her fingernails or the way her coat pockets bulged slightly. <words>398</words> She had broken free from their limitations not through grand gestures but through the simple act of remembering what could grow when no one was watching. <words>425</words> The wooden clothespin remained in the vault, marking the spot where the first new dream would take root. <words>444</words> Tomorrow, she would return. <words>448</words> Tomorrow, everything would regenerate. <words>452</words>
