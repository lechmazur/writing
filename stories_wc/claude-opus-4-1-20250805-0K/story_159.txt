Marcus lived in the sandstone labyrinth's forgotten corners, where floating lanterns cast shadows that danced like memories. <words>15</words> Once a celebrated scholar, he now carried his kingdom in a weather-beaten kaleidoscope, its fractured mirrors reflecting infinite versions of truth. <words>35</words>

The labyrinth had consumed him after his transformative betrayal—when his closest friend stole his theorem proving the maze's solution, then declared it unsolvable. <words>59</words> That theft hadn't just taken credit; it had rewritten reality, making the world forget Marcus had ever existed as anything but a vagrant. <words>82</words>

Yet Marcus remained earnestly frivolous in his mission. <words>90</words> During readings—those sacred hours when the lanterns dimmed and visitors gathered in the labyrinth's amphitheaters for poetry—he would appear at random weddings held within the maze's walls. <words>118</words> These ceremonies, performed between the ancient stones, drew couples seeking the labyrinth's blessing. <words>131</words>

His method was peculiar: confetti-coded proposals. <words>137</words> Each colored paper fragment bore a symbol, and when thrown together during the celebration, they formed mathematical proofs. <words>155</words> Red triangles for angles, blue circles for constants, gold stars marking pivotal turns. <words>168</words> The newlyweds thought him merely a colorful beggar adding whimsy to their day, tossing him coins as he danced through their festivities. <words>190</words>

But Marcus was extending something far greater—an invitation to see. <words>200</words> His kaleidoscope, when held to the light of the floating lanterns, transformed the scattered confetti into three-dimensional maps. <words>218</words> Most dismissed him as mad, but occasionally, a curious soul would peer through his strange instrument. <words>235</words>

One evening, during the reading of ancient love poems, a bride named Sera noticed the patterns in his thrown papers. <words>255</words> She gathered the confetti from her dress, arranging them as Marcus hummed. <words>267</words> "You're him," she whispered, recognizing the elegance of his equations. <words>277</words> "The mathematician who disappeared." <words>281</words>

Marcus smiled, extending his kaleidoscope to her. <words>288</words> Through its weathered brass tube, she saw it: the labyrinth's solution, encoded in celebration and joy rather than cold logic. <words>308</words> The path required not solving but becoming—transforming through each betrayal, each loss, into something simpler yet more complex. <words>326</words>

"Why hide it in weddings?" <words>331</words> Sera asked. <words>333</words>

"Because love, like labyrinths, seems unsolvable until you realize you're not meant to escape," Marcus replied. <words>349</words> "You're meant to understand that the center and the entrance are the same place, seen from different angles." <words>367</words>

As the reading concluded and lanterns brightened, Sera scattered his confetti one final time. <words>381</words> The colored papers hung suspended in the air, forming a perfect spiral—the labyrinth's true shape, visible only to those who knew that wisdom could wear rags and truth could dance at strangers' celebrations. <words>415</words>

Marcus vanished into the sandstone shadows, his kingdom of infinite reflections intact, leaving Sera with the proof that would restore his name. <words>438</words> The labyrinth, finally puzzled out, revealed its deepest secret: it had never been about finding the way out, but about discovering who you become while searching. <words>465</words>
