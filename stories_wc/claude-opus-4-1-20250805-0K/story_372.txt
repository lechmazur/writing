Marcus pressed the unused sticky label against the grimy window, marking another surveillance point in the sprawling slums of Neo-Singapore. <words>18</words> The adhesive had lost its stick years ago, much like his ability to feel anything beyond the ache for Vera, who'd vanished into these same maze-like undercities after their last mission together. <words>50</words>

He caught his reflection in a puddle of chemical runoff—unfamiliar, warped by the iridescent liquid into something he didn't recognize anymore. <words>71</words> The face staring back seemed curiously indifferent to his pain, as if the slums had already digested his former self and spat out this hollow operative. <words>97</words> 

Three blocks away, in a corrugated steel shack that served as both noodle shop and dead drop, Vera lifted chopsticks to her mouth. <words>121</words> At the instant the new recipe touched her tongue—fermented protein strands laced with memory-suppressant compounds—she felt it: the avalanche beginning. <words>142</words> Not of snow, but of data, cascading through her neural implants, threatening to bury every encrypted secret she'd stolen from the agency. <words>165</words>

She had to run. <words>169</words>

Marcus tracked her heat signature through the labyrinth, their old shared interest in urban exploration serving him well as he navigated forgotten maintenance tunnels and vertical favelas. <words>196</words> They'd once spent nights mapping these places together, before the agency, before the betrayals, before love became another form of intelligence gathering. <words>219</words>

The avalanche of data pursued Vera through synaptic pathways, each byte adding weight to her consciousness, slowing her down. <words>238</words> She stumbled into an abandoned parking structure where they'd once shared their first kiss, the concrete pillars now covered in bioluminescent graffiti that pulsed like a dying heart. <words>267</words>

Marcus cornered her there, and for a moment, allowed himself to gloat—not over catching her, but over the cosmic joke of it all. <words>291</words> "Destiny's just the agency's rambling dressed up as fate," he said, his voice echoing off rust-eaten walls. <words>308</words> "We keep running in circles, marking our territory with meaningless labels, pretending we're mapping something that matters." <words>325</words>

Vera's eyes flickered with recognition, then static, as the data avalanche reached critical mass. <words>339</words> "The recipe," she gasped, "it's not suppressing memories—it's revealing them." <words>350</words> "Every reflection we avoided, every feeling we labeled as intel, it's all cascading back." <words>365</words>

In that rambling structure where their paths had first intertwined, Marcus understood that the avalanche wasn't meant to be outrun. <words>385</words> He reached for her hand as the weight of their unprocessed past crashed down, two spies finally drowning in the intelligence of their own hearts. <words>411</words> The unused label fluttered from his pocket, landing between them—a blank possibility in a city built on forgotten names. <words>430</words>
