Marcus had spent forty years picking locks in the colonial quarter, but tonight he climbed toward the labyrinth orchard that crowned the old townhouses, his calloused fingers clutching embroidered gloves he'd never worn. <words>30</words>

The gloves had arrived that morning with a note: "The pottery class awaits." <words>43</words>

He'd laughed bitterly—pottery classes were for retirees seeking purpose, not locksmiths who'd opened every door except the ones that mattered. <words>63</words>

Yet here he stood among the rooftop's twisted apple trees, their branches forming corridors that led to a kiln glowing like a heart. <words>86</words>

Inside, a woman shaped clay with movements that were delightfully menacing, each gesture precise enough to snap necks or craft perfection. <words>107</words>

"You're late," she said without looking up. <words>114</words>

"I don't do pottery." <words>118</words>

"You do now." <words>121</words>

She gestured to a wheel where wet clay waited. <words>130</words>

"The unclaimed throne isn't just a legend," she continued, her voice carrying the demure audacity of someone discussing murder over tea. <words>151</words>

Marcus froze. <words>153</words>

Every locksmith knew the story—a throne hidden somewhere in the colonial quarter, its location encoded in objects scattered through generations. <words>173</words>

"Put on the gloves." <words>177</words>

The embroidered patterns came alive under the kiln's light, revealing maps stitched in hunting scenes—hawks diving, hounds cornering prey. <words>196</words>

"My grandmother embroidered these using techniques from the old hunting guilds," she explained. <words>209</words>

"Each stitch preserves methods that would otherwise vanish—tracking, trapping, patience." <words>219</words>

Marcus pulled them on, feeling the threads' texture through his weathered skin. <words>231</words>

"Now paint." <words>233</words>

She handed him a brush and indicated the pottery piece he'd somehow shaped—a crown. <words>247</words>

As he painted, the orchard's apple-scent began to permeate everything, seeping through walls, through skin, through the careful boundaries he'd built around his heart. <words>271</words>

"The throne chooses its keeper," she said, watching his strokes become confident, almost violent in their precision. <words>288</words>

"Someone who understands locks aren't about keeping people out, but about knowing when to let them in." <words>305</words>

The painted crown revealed coordinates hidden in its glazed surface, visible only during the painting's wet phase. <words>322</words>

Marcus memorized them instantly—a locksmith's habit. <words>329</words>

"Why me?" <words>331</words>

"Because you're jaded enough to resist its corruption, skilled enough to find it, and empty enough to need it." <words>350</words>

Her brutal honesty should have stung, but Marcus found himself smiling. <words>361</words>

"And you?" <words>363</words>

"I preserve the old ways—hunting methods, forgotten crafts, patient stalking of truth through generations." <words>377</words>

She removed her own gloves, revealing scarred hands. <words>385</words>

"The throne isn't power—it's responsibility." <words>390</words>

Outside, the labyrinth orchard whispered secrets through apple leaves while the colonial town slept below, unaware that its next king was learning to shape clay with embroidered gloves, painting his way toward a destiny he'd spent forty years avoiding. <words>431</words>

Marcus understood now—some locks weren't meant to be picked, but painted open with delicate, menacing strokes. <words>447</words>

The throne would wait no longer. <words>453</words>
