High above the Amazon floor, where rope bridges swayed between mahogany giants, Lucia adjusted her exorcist badges with the pride of someone who'd earned every scratch on them. <words>23</words> The treehouse city of Curupira had seen better days, but then again, so had she. <words>38</words> At forty-three, her endearingly feisty demeanor still made demons think twice, though lately her knees complained louder than the spirits she banished. <words>60</words>

The wizard's battered grimoire landed on her doorstep at precisely 11:59, when the clock dared to skip a beat and time hiccupped like a drunk hummingbird. <words>87</words> "Of course," she muttered, recognizing her predecessor's handwriting bleeding through water-stained pages. <words>99</words> Master Eduardo's shadow still loomed over every exorcism she performed, every spirit she failed to save as elegantly as he would have. <words>121</words>

Inside, between coffee stains and what looked suspiciously like demon blood, she found it: a spell to youthify. <words>139</words> "Because nothing says 'responsible guardian of reality' like turning back time on your wrinkles," she snorted, but her fingers traced the incantation anyway. <words>162</words>

The weight of responsibility pressed harder when the main bridge to the outer platforms collapsed that morning, cutting off her usual path to the possessed district. <words>188</words> Seventeen families trapped with a poltergeist, and her only route now required swinging across vines like some budget action hero. <words>208</words> Her joints screamed in protest. <words>213</words>

"Fine," she told the grimoire, as if it cared about her dignity. <words>225</words> "But if I end up as a teenager with acne and existential dread, I'm haunting Eduardo myself." <words>242</words>

The spell tasted like regret and coconut water. <words>250</words> Her bones crackled, skin tightened, and suddenly she stood twenty years younger, muscle memory intact but with abs that actually responded to commands. <words>273</words> "Well, this is annoyingly convenient," she admitted, grabbing her exorcism kit. <words>284</words>

She swung across the vine highway with embarrassing ease, landing among the possessed platforms where terrified families huddled in corners. <words>303</words> The poltergeist took one look at her youthful frame and laughed. <words>314</words> "They send children now?" <words>318</words>

"Honey," Lucia cracked her rejuvenated knuckles, "I was banishing spirits before you learned to rattle chains." <words>333</words> The exorcism took twelve minutes, a personal record that would've made Eduardo proud. <words>346</words> Or jealous. <words>348</words> Preferably jealous. <words>350</words>

Later, examining her reflection in rainwater pooled on platforms, she saw the burden hadn't lifted with the years. <words>368</words> Responsibility, it turned out, aged the soul regardless of the body's protests. <words>380</words> "At least now I can reach the high shelves," she mused, tucking the grimoire under her arm. <words>397</words> Tomorrow she'd reverse the spell, probably, but tonight Curupira's proud exorcist would enjoy outrunning Eduardo's shadow, even if just by a few stolen decades. <words>422</words> After all, saving souls was serious business, but who said she couldn't look fabulous doing it? <words>438</words> The grimoire hummed agreement, or maybe that was just the termites in the floorboards. <words>452</words> In this city, you never really knew. <words>459</words>
