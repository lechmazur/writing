The soothsayer's fingers trembled as she traced the water rings on the bar top, each circle a prophecy the desert had tried to erase. <words>20</words> "Oh fantastic," she muttered, squinting at the warped wood, "the future of Earth's last aquifer is written in beer stains." <words>38</words> 

Outside, the maze of billboards flickered their neon promises—PARADISE COMING SOON, WATER TOMORROW, GREEN DREAMS NOW—lies stacked against the crimson sky like playing cards waiting to fall. <words>65</words> The bar, abandoned between what locals called the lost years (after the wells dried, before hope did), served as her divination chamber. <words>87</words>

She pulled out the pocket puzzle box, its thirteen locks catching the pulsing light. <words>101</words> Each lock, she'd learned, corresponded to a water ring on this particular bar—probably unlikely anyone else would make that connection, but then again, destiny rarely advertised its methods in neon. <words>131</words> 

"Environmental stewardship," she snorted, magnifying the smallest ring with her cracked lens. <words>143</words> "That's what they called it when they planted these billboards instead of trees." <words>156</words> The ring revealed numbers: coordinates to the last pure spring, hidden beneath layers of corporate lies and sand. <words>174</words>

Her mild panic intensified as she worked the first lock. <words>184</words> The Council of Tomorrow would arrive at dawn, ready to drain whatever remained for their floating city schemes. <words>202</words> "Shape destiny with bare hands," her grandmother had said, passing her this box. <words>216</words> "Even if those hands shake." <words>221</words>

Click. <words>222</words> The first lock opened. <words>226</words> 

She read the next ring, larger, angrier—a year when someone had slammed down glass after glass, trying to forget the salmon runs that never came. <words>251</words> The corresponding lock required three turns left, two right, like a dance with extinction. <words>266</words>

"Absolutely stellar planning," she hissed at the billboards through the window. <words>277</words> "Let's put up more advertisements for water parks in the desert while the actual water commits suicide underground." <words>295</words>

Twelve locks down. <words>298</words> Her fingers ached. <words>301</words> The maze outside hummed with electric prophecy, each billboard a false prophet promising salvation through consumption. <words>317</words> The final ring, barely visible, held the worst truth—it wasn't from a glass at all, but from tears. <words>335</words>

The last lock recognized grief as its key. <words>343</words>

The box opened, revealing not a map but seeds—ancient, patient things that knew how to drink morning dew and nothing more. <words>365</words> "Of course," she laughed bitterly. <words>370</words> "The answer to saving the world is probably unlikely to involve anything as dramatic as I imagined." <words>387</words>

She pocketed the seeds and walked into the neon maze, ready to plant tomorrow between the billboards' lies, one mildly panicked handful at a time. <words>412</words>
