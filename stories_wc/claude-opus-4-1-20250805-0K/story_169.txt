Marcus Veil adjusted his obsidian tie, preparing to showcase the floating tea platform to his latest client—though "client" was perhaps too mundane a term for someone trading their essence for real estate. <words>24</words>

The platform hovered three feet above the recycling center's sorting floor, its jade surface impossibly pristine despite the chaos below. <words>44</words>

"As you can observe," Marcus began, his voice carrying the practiced cadence of someone who'd sold infinity itself, "this property remains weirdly static while the world churns beneath it." <words>73</words>

His client, a composer whose fingers had forgotten their purpose, gazed at the dusty wine bottle centered on the platform's ceremonial table. <words>95</words>

"The previous owner left that," Marcus explained, recognizing the hunger in the composer's eyes. <words>109</words>

Throughout recycling shifts below, workers sorted glass and plastic while the platform maintained its eternal teatime, never acknowledging the industrial symphony. <words>130</words>

Marcus had mastered the art of persuasion not through aggressive tactics, but through choreographed restraint—each gesture calculated to seem effortless. <words>150</words>

"May I?" the composer asked, reaching for the bottle. <words>159</words>

"Please," Marcus replied, knowing what would come next. <words>167</words>

The composer began reading the reversed labels visible through the dusty glass bottles that lined the platform's edges—not wine storage, but something far more precious. <words>192</words>

"These are... musical notations," the composer whispered. <words>199</words>

"Indeed," Marcus confirmed with rehearsed surprise, though he'd choreographed this revelation countless times before. <words>213</words>

Each bottle contained forgotten songs, their melodies imprisoned in fermented silence, readable only when viewed through another bottle's curved glass. <words>233</words>

"The platform records everything," Marcus continued, allowing just enough wonder to color his professional tone. <words>248</words>

"Every conversation during tea, every hummed tune, every accidental rhythm created by the recycling machinery below—all captured, reversed, bottled." <words>267</words>

The composer's hands trembled as understanding dawned. <words>274</words>

"To learn these forgotten songs, one must remain here, reading through glass, throughout recycling's endless cycles." <words>290</words>

Marcus produced the contract with fluid grace, his movements suggesting both infinite patience and urgent opportunity. <words>306</words>

"The price, as discussed, is thirty percent of your soul's resonance—enough to feel the loss, not enough to silence you completely." <words>328</words>

The composer signed without hesitation, trading ethereal currency for the chance to decrypt melodies from dust and glass. <words>346</words>

As Marcus departed, descending through the recycling center's cacophony, he permitted himself a moment of satisfaction. <words>362</words>

He'd matched another soul to their perfect property, maintaining his reputation as the broker who understood that sometimes the smallest spaces contained the grandest symphonies. <words>386</words>

Above him, the platform remained weirdly static, its new owner already lost in the reversed refrains of forgotten songs, reading eternity through dusty glass while the world recycled itself below. <words>417</words>
