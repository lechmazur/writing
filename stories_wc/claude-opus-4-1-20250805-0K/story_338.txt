The artificer's workshop sprawled through three abandoned subway platforms, littered with thousands of cracked phone cases—each one a fossil of someone's dropped moment. <words>19</words> Zephyr collected them obsessively, though she never bothered learning the names of those who'd owned them. <words>34</words>

She wasn't unfriendly, just personally detached in the way artists become when their work consumes them whole. <words>51</words> While others saw garbage, she saw galaxies in spider-webbed glass, constellations in shattered plastic corners. <words>66</words> The underground labyrinth of tunnels had become her sanctuary from a world that expected artificers to craft weapons or wealth, not beauty from broken things. <words>91</words>

Today, something shifted. <words>94</words>

The rotary phone—her only connection to the surface—rang with its mechanical wheeze. <words>107</words> She'd modified it to receive calls through temporal loops, catching conversations that hadn't happened yet or had already occurred centuries ago. <words>128</words> The incomplete call logs painted fractured stories: "—mother's surgery went—" click. <words>138</words> "—love you too, but—" dial tone. <words>144</words> "—earthquake in sector—" static. <words>148</words>

Zephyr rarely answered, preferring to let the messages accumulate like her phone cases, but this call persisted across timelines. <words>167</words> The same voice, folding through temporal layers: "Please inform the Council—the stereotype protocols have failed—beauty exists in—" <words>185</words>

She lifted the receiver. <words>189</words>

"You're receiving this because time folds in on itself tonight," the voice said, somehow both urgent and resigned. <words>207</words> "The Council believes artificers must serve function over form. <words>216</words> They're coming to clear the tunnels." <words>222</words>

Zephyr surveyed her domain—empty abundance everywhere. <words>228</words> Miles of mosaics made from phone case fragments, each catching ghost-light from dead subway bulbs she'd rewired to pulse with bioluminescent bacteria. <words>250</words> Sculptures of everyday disasters frozen in polymer and glass. <words>259</words> A cathedral to the overlooked. <words>264</words>

"When?" she asked, though time meant little here. <words>272</words>

"They've already arrived. <words>275</words> They left yesterday. <words>278</words> They come tomorrow." <words>281</words> The voice crackled. <words>284</words> "I'm calling from a timeline where your work survived. <words>293</words> Where it changed everything. <words>297</words> Where people finally understood that artificers could be more than their stereotypes suggested." <words>310</words>

Through the tunnels, Zephyr heard footsteps echoing from all temporal directions—past, future, and the impossible present. <words>326</words> She grabbed her favorite piece: a phone case so thoroughly destroyed it had become lace, holding light like captured stars. <words>346</words>

"Tell them," she said into the receiver, her detachment finally cracking like her collected cases, "that I found it. <words>365</words> Beauty in the mundane. <words>369</words> Tell them an artificer can break things to make them whole." <words>380</words>

The line went dead, but the message had already been delivered, would be delivered, was being delivered across every timeline where someone needed to hear that stereotypes were just another mundane thing waiting to be shattered into something beautiful. <words>419</words>

She sat among her empty abundance, finally understanding that her detachment had been its own kind of connection all along. <words>439</words>

The footsteps grew closer, arriving from every direction of time. <words>449</words>

Zephyr smiled and began to work. <words>455</words>
