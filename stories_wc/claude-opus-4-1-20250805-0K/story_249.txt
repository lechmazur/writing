Marcus Weatherby had been a masked vigilante for exactly three years before deciding that anonymity was overrated. <words>17</words> Now, unmasked and unemployed, he spent his afternoons in the City of Forgotten Fountains, where dry basins collected memories instead of water. <words>38</words>

His latest obsession involved collecting traditional games—not the boards or pieces themselves, but the moments when people played them. <words>58</words> He'd developed a lazily ambitious system: minimal effort, maximum nostalgia harvesting. <words>69</words> The antique dentist's drill he'd inherited from his grandfather served as his primary tool, though not for teeth. <words>87</words> When pressed against the limestone of abandoned fountains, it hummed at frequencies that made people remember their childhoods. <words>105</words>

The city's barbershop quartet, The Copper Pennies, rehearsed every Tuesday in the old Meridian Fountain's amphitheater. <words>121</words> Marcus had discovered that analyzing their between-song gossip revealed exactly who in the neighborhood still played marbles, jacks, or stickball with their grandchildren. <words>145</words> "Mrs. Chen's grandson visits Sundays," the tenor would mention. <words>154</words> "They play Chinese checkers until dark," the bass would add. <words>164</words>

Today, Marcus waited at the pause between raindrops—that magical moment when the air held its breath and even cynics believed in possibility. <words>187</words> He needed to lure the quartet's baritone, Samuel, to the Neptune Fountain three blocks away. <words>202</words> Samuel supposedly knew where the last complete set of pickup sticks in the city was hidden. <words>219</words>

Marcus pressed the drill against the fountain's base, creating a subtle vibration that sounded like distant laughter. <words>236</words> The art of resilience, he'd learned, wasn't about being unbreakable. <words>246</words> It was about bending with purpose, finding joy in peculiar missions after your serious ones ended. <words>263</words>

Samuel arrived within minutes, drawn by the phantom sound of his daughter's giggle from thirty years past. <words>280</words> "She loved this fountain," Samuel whispered, touching the cracked marble. <words>290</words>

"The games we played here mattered," Marcus said, appearing from behind a pillar. <words>303</words> "I'm collecting them—the memories, the rules, the reasons we played." <words>313</words>

Samuel studied Marcus's unmasked face, recognizing the former vigilante who'd once saved his shop from arsonists. <words>329</words> "The pickup sticks are in my attic," he admitted. <words>338</words> "But they're worthless without the story." <words>344</words>

"Then tell me," Marcus said, his drill humming against stone. <words>354</words>

As Samuel spoke of summer evenings and patient fathers teaching impatient children, the forgotten fountain began to weep—not water, but something sweeter. <words>377</words> The city had always been magic; Marcus had simply been too busy fighting crime to notice. <words>394</words> Now, unmasked and unhurried, he collected what truly mattered: the games that taught humans how to lose gracefully and win together. <words>416</words> His hidden whimsy had become his greatest strength. <words>424</words> The art of resilience bloomed in unexpected gardens. <words>432</words>
