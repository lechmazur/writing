Dr. Marina Voss pressed the crumpled invitation against her chest, feeling its edges cut into her palm like forgotten dreams. <words>17</words> The vapor collection facility hummed with its quiet pulse—that occasionally frequent rhythm that only trained ears could detect, like a heartbeat between worlds. <words>40</words>

She had come here during baking hours, when the industrial ovens below transformed moisture into clouds that rose through specialized chambers, creating the perfect cover for her work. <words>68</words> As a professional dream interpreter, Marina understood that steam carried more than water; it carried the residue of human consciousness, fragments of thoughts that calcified in the collection tanks above. <words>98</words>

The invitation had arrived three weeks after Elias Crowe vanished. <words>108</words> He'd been the facility's chief engineer, the only person who truly understood how vapor could be harvested to reveal the dreams trapped within. <words>132</words> Now Marina stood in his office, wearing his spare uniform, having memorized his gait, his peculiar habit of tapping doorframes twice before entering. <words>156</words>

Security believed she was him—returned from whatever crisis had pulled him away. <words>169</words> They didn't question the slight difference in height, the way her voice caught on certain consonants. <words>186</words> Faith worked that way in this place, peculiar and unexamined, built on the assumption that missing people always returned to their obsessions. <words>209</words>

The invitation's message was simple: "The laws are wrong. Help me prove it." <words>222</words> Marina knew what Elias meant. <words>227</words> The ancient regulations governing dream interpretation—literally carved into stone tablets at the Ministry—declared that dreams were individual property, unable to be shared or transferred. <words>252</words> But here, in the rising steam, dreams merged and separated like clouds forming and reforming. <words>268</words>

She found his hidden laboratory behind a false panel, where crystallized dream-vapor lined the walls like frozen waterfalls. <words>286</words> Each formation contained thousands of overlapping dreams, proving that consciousness wasn't singular but collective, flowing between minds like water through a shared aquifer. <words>310</words>

The quiet pulse grew stronger as Marina activated Elias's equipment. <words>320</words> The machines began their work, documenting what the Ministry refused to acknowledge: dreams weren't isolated islands but an ocean, and the laws needed rewriting. <words>344</words>

As vapor swirled around her, carrying the hopes and fears of the workers below, Marina understood why Elias had chosen her. <words>365</words> She could interpret what others couldn't see—the truth calcifying in these chambers, waiting to shatter old beliefs. <words>382</words>

Tomorrow, she would present this evidence to the Ministry, still wearing Elias's face. <words>395</words> They would have to listen, have to accept that their stone tablets were wrong. <words>409</words> The quiet pulse would become a roar, and the world would finally understand that dreams, like vapor, belonged to everyone and no one at once. <words>435</words>
