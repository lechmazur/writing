The bronze statue of Lady Meridian had stood in Cogwheel Square for ninety-three years, watching steam carriages rattle past through eyes that everyone assumed were blind. <words>20</words> But beneath her verdigris skin pulsed a consciousness that could slip into minds like water through cracks, searching for one thing: truth. <words>39</words>

Throughout the planning of the city's Centennial Festival, she'd listened to the committee's thoughts—their promises were ink on water, pretty but meaningless. <words>61</words> Mayor Blackwood's mind bloomed with corruption while his mouth spoke of civic pride, and Lady Meridian felt that tragically joyful sensation of being right about humanity's capacity for deception. <words>90</words>

A child approached her pedestal, clutching a threadbare hair tie that had once been scarlet. <words>105</words> The girl's thoughts rang clear as bells: *My sister wore this before she disappeared, before the factory explosion they said never happened.* <words>127</words>

Lady Meridian's telepathy surged, and for the first time in decades, she moved. <words>140</words> Just a finger at first, bronze joints screaming protest against years of weather. <words>153</words> The committee had tried to weatherize her with special sealants, but they'd never imagined she'd need flexibility. <words>170</words>

The child gasped, dropping the hair tie, but Lady Meridian's mind touched hers gently: *I know where the truth is buried.* <words>191</words>

Through autumn rain and winter frost, throughout the planning meetings she couldn't attend but could psychically observe, Lady Meridian had watched them forge documents. <words>215</words> She'd seen them practice their signatures with the flow of ink in calligraphy lessons, perfecting lies that would become history. <words>235</words> The factory explosion had killed forty-seven workers, including the child's sister, but the records would show it never existed. <words>254</words>

Steam hissed from the square's ornamental pipes as Lady Meridian took her first full step down. <words>270</words> Her bronze feet rang against cobblestones like funeral bells played in major key—that gloomy cheerfulness of vindication. <words>287</words> The child stood frozen, but not with fear. <words>295</words> In her young eyes blazed the light of recognition: someone else knew the truth. <words>309</words>

"The documents," Lady Meridian's voice creaked like a door unopened for centuries, "are hidden in the mayor's music box." <words>328</words> She bent, her metal fingers closing around the threadbare hair tie with impossible tenderness. <words>342</words> "Your sister Maria wore this the day she saved twelve children from the blast." <words>356</words>

The child's tears fell on bronze hands that had finally found purpose in movement. <words>370</words> By evening, the forged documents would surface, the truth spreading through the steam-powered city like fire through coal. <words>388</words> Lady Meridian smiled her fixed smile, but now it meant something different—the tragically joyful knowledge that sometimes, just sometimes, truth wins simply by refusing to stay buried. <words>416</words>

She returned to her pedestal as sirens began to wail, clutching the hair tie like a battle standard, a monument no longer to lies but to the eternal possibility of revelation. <words>447</words>
