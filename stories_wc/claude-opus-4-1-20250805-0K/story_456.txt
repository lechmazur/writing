The morbid florist arrived at the floating rock dojo as the sun bled crimson across the horizon. <words>14</words> She clutched a plain white candle, her fingers trembling with what others mistook for fear but was actually restrained eagerness. <words>33</words> Master Koji had promised answers about cosmic cycles—why flowers bloomed only to decay, why death fed life eternal. <words>51</words>

"You came," he observed, his voice neither welcoming nor dismissive. <words>61</words> The dojo hovered three hundred feet above the valley, tethered by ancient chains that groaned like dying things. <words>79</words>

"I had to oblige your invitation," she replied, her neutrally passionate tone betraying neither hope nor despair. <words>96</words> "My shop is full of endings that pretend to be beautiful." <words>107</words>

He led her inside where a guttering lantern cast wild shadows. <words>118</words> "Beauty and decay are lovers," he said, opening an old trunk. <words>129</words> "A writer left this decades ago—pages upon pages of tempered beliefs about existence." <words>143</words>

She knelt beside him, inhaling dust and old paper. <words>152</words> The backlog of typed pages spoke of cycles: stellar deaths birthing nebulae, corpses nourishing soil, endings becoming beginnings. <words>170</words> Each page challenged what she thought she knew, yet confirmed what she'd always suspected while arranging funeral wreaths. <words>189</words>

"Your candle," Master Koji commanded gently. <words>195</words>

She lit it from the dying lantern's flame. <words>203</words> In the last flicker of the guttering lantern, she saw him clearly—not a martial arts master but a gardener of souls. <words>224</words> His dojo wasn't for fighting; it was for understanding the fight between existence and void. <words>239</words>

"Read," he instructed, and she did, page after page. <words>248</words> The writer had been like her—someone who arranged death professionally, seeking meaning in the endless wheel. <words>264</words> A mortician who'd documented every pattern: how grief recycled into acceptance, how endings sparked new searches for meaning. <words>282</words>

Hours passed. <words>284</words> The candle burned steady while she absorbed lifetimes of observations. <words>294</words> Her tempered beliefs—neither fully cynical nor naively optimistic—found validation in these yellowed pages. <words>308</words> The universe wasn't cruel or kind; it simply was, endlessly consuming and creating itself. <words>323</words>

"Do you understand now?" Koji asked as dawn approached. <words>332</words>

She stood, legs stiff, mind expanded. <words>338</words> "Every bouquet I've arranged for caskets—I was documenting the same truth this writer found." <words>353</words> Her voice carried a boldly timid quality, brave enough to speak but humble before the magnitude. <words>370</words> "Death isn't the opposite of life. They're dance partners in cosmic cycles I can finally see clearly." <words>387</words>

The plain white candle had burned to nothing, but its light had revealed everything. <words>401</words> She descended from the floating rock dojo transformed—still a morbid florist, but now one who understood her role in the universe's endless, beautiful recycling. <words>426</words>
