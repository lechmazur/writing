<story>
The heartbroken reaper descended into the cave's mouth, her scythe dragging against limestone as she ventured deeper into darkness. <words>17</words> Three centuries had passed since she'd last collected a soul with genuine care, and the weight of endless partings had finally cracked something vital within her ethereal chest. <words>45</words>

The forgotten library revealed itself through phosphorescent moss, its shelves carved directly from living rock. <words>60</words> She'd come to map hidden springs—those secret wells where mortal memories pooled before evaporating into the void—but found instead something unexpected. <words>82</words> There, balanced on a stone lectern, lay the first draft of what would become humanity's most beloved novel, its pages yellowed but intact. <words>106</words>

The manuscript's margins bloomed with corrections in different hands, evolving relationships between author and editors visible in every crossed word and gentle suggestion. <words>130</words> As she touched the paper, seeds scattered from the binding—dropped long ago by a migrating bird that had nested in these pages during some forgotten summer. <words>157</words>

The seeds fell onto damp stone and immediately sprouted, their growth softly thunderous in the cave's silence. <words>174</words> Vines twisted upward, flowering with words she'd harvested from dying lips: "wait for me," "I'm sorry," "one more day." <words>194</words> Each bloom pulsed with the fearful joy she recognized from mortals standing at life's precipice, terrified and exhilarated by what lay beyond. <words>217</words>

She read the manuscript by flower-light, discovering it told of a gardener who fell in love with autumn itself. <words>237</words> The story mapped the hidden springs of the human heart with such precision that she wept for the first time since becoming what she was. <words>263</words> Her tears fell onto the seeds, and where they landed, new plants grew—hybrids of sorrow and hope she'd never seen before. <words>285</words>

The author's notes revealed they'd written this while dying, each chapter a negotiation with the very reaper now holding their work. <words>307</words> "You were kind," the margin read, "kinder than I deserved at my end." <words>321</words> She remembered him now—the young man who'd asked her to wait while he finished one last sentence. <words>339</words>

The vines reached the ceiling, breaking through to sunlight above, transforming the forgotten library into something alive and breathing. <words>358</words> She understood then that her venture here existed at the quiet intersection of heartbreak and healing, where endings became beginnings. <words>379</words> The springs she'd meant to map weren't hidden in the cave but in the evolving relationships between loss and growth, death and story. <words>403</words>

Carefully, she lifted the manuscript, knowing it must reach the world above. <words>416</words> As she climbed toward light, seeds fell from her robes, promising gardens in the darkness below. <words>433</words> The softly thunderous sound of her healing heart echoed through stone, a fearful joy that would forever change how she reaped. <words>455</words> Some souls, she realized, never truly died—they just learned to grow in different soil. <words>470</words>
