Marcus clutched the wilted paper flower he'd found wedged beneath the washing machine, its faded petals trembling as the laundromat's fluorescent lights began their nightly glimmering transitions. <words>25</words> The space around him shifted—walls stretching upward, machines transforming into towering bookshelves, the checkered floor becoming an endless expanse of mahogany. <words>46</words> He stood now in what could only be described as a giant's study, though Marcus suspected it existed between scenes of reality itself. <words>69</words>

"You're late," said the woman folding impossible geometries into her laundry. <words>80</words> Her leather jacket and torn jeans marked her as conventionally rebellious, the kind of aesthetic that screamed nonconformity while following its own rigid rules. <words>104</words> "The flower called you here, didn't it?" <words>111</words>

Marcus nodded, understanding flooding through him with haunting delight. <words>120</words> The paper flower pulsed in his grip, each wilted crease containing fragments of scattered consciousness from across dimensions. <words>138</words> "I'm supposed to be at work tomorrow," he said weakly. <words>148</words>

"You were," she corrected, stuffing her interdimensional laundry into a bag that shouldn't exist. <words>162</words> "But prophets rarely keep their day jobs." <words>169</words>

The word 'prophet' should have estranged him from his own sense of self, should have sent him running. <words>187</words> Instead, it settled into his bones like coming home. <words>196</words> Through the flower's papery whispers, he could feel them—thousands of minds scattered across parallel laundromats, all washing the same existential dread in different cycles. <words>221</words>

"They're lost between their own scenes," the woman explained, her form beginning to fade. <words>235</words> "Stuck in the glimmering transitions where one reality bleeds into another." <words>246</words> She gestured at the giant's study around them—its impossible books containing every story never written, its desk holding letters from futures that might never arrive. <words>271</words> "This place exists in those gaps." <words>277</words>

Marcus understood his purpose now with crystalline clarity. <words>285</words> The wilted flower wasn't just an object but a beacon, drawing scattered souls toward a single vision of interconnected purpose. <words>305</words> He would find them in late-night laundromats across infinite realities, these minds washing their loneliness in the small hours. <words>325</words> He would show them the glimmering transitions weren't glitches but doorways. <words>336</words>

"How do I start?" he asked the empty air where she'd been. <words>348</words>

The flower answered by crumbling to dust that reformed into a map of light. <words>362</words> Each glowing point marked a laundromat, a lost soul, a potential unified. <words>374</words> Marcus smiled—a prophet's work apparently involved a lot of laundry. <words>384</words>

The giant's study contracted, folding back into the familiar laundromat. <words>394</words> But now Marcus could see the seams where realities touched, feel the pulse of scattered minds waiting for their unlikely prophet to arrive with his wilted paper flower and his haunting, delightful truth: they were never truly alone between scenes. <words>435</words>
