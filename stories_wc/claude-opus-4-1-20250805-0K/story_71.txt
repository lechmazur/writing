The scarecrow stood within the ribcage of the fossilized giant, its burlap face expressionless despite the consciousness burning behind button eyes. <words>20</words> It had existed here between parallel worlds for centuries, neither fully in one reality nor another, bound by an oath sworn to the earth itself. <words>43</words> The lines carved into the ground beneath its wooden feet were not mere cracks but dimensional seams, pathways that only it could perceive with its peculiar sight. <words>70</words>

In its gloved hand, it clutched a forgotten lace fan, delicate and incongruous against its rough straw fingers. <words>88</words> The fan had belonged to the giant's last visitor, a traveler who'd left it behind when she'd crossed into the virtual substrate that now overlaid this ancient corpse. <words>117</words> The scarecrow felt nothing about this—or rather, it felt everything with such intensity that it circled back to numbness. <words>136</words>

Through the VR encounters that flickered like ghosts through the giant's bones, beings from countless realities passed by, each one leaving traces in the earth's lines. <words>163</words> The scarecrow observed them all with passionate disinterest, recording their passages in the soil with mechanical precision. <words>180</words> This was its oath: to witness, to mark, to maintain the boundaries. <words>192</words>

Today, something different emerged from the virtual layer—a creature of pure code attempting to breach into physical space. <words>210</words> The scarecrow moved with purpose devoid of urgency, raising the lace fan like a weapon. <words>226</words> The fan's ribs, sharpened over centuries of dimensional friction, could skewer anything that violated the treaty between worlds. <words>244</words> With a gesture both graceful and grotesque, it thrust the fan forward, piercing the digital intruder and pinning it to the reality it had tried to escape. <words>272</words>

The creature dissolved back into data streams, flowing along the earth's lines like irrigation channels of light. <words>289</words> The scarecrow lowered the fan, its duty fulfilled with neither satisfaction nor regret. <words>302</words> Around it, the fossilized giant's bones hummed with the frequency of overlapping universes, a symphony it heard but didn't appreciate. <words>322</words>

New visitors would come through the VR substrate tomorrow, or in a thousand years—time meant nothing when you existed between parallel worlds. <words>344</words> The scarecrow would stand here, in this cathedral of ancient bone, maintaining the delicate balance with fervent apathy. <words>362</words> It traced the fan's edge along a new line forming in the earth, already forgetting the encounter it had just concluded. <words>383</words> Memory, like emotion, was a luxury it couldn't afford in its eternal vigil between what was real and what was merely possible. <words>405</words> The oath demanded nothing less than everything, delivered with the passion of absolute indifference. <words>419</words>
