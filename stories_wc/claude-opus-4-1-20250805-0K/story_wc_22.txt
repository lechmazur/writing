The coachman of Gloom-hill arrived at the jetty as purple twilight bled across the harbor, where wild roses had overtaken the rotting planks. [21] Three years had passed since the reef died, taking with it the fish, the divers, and finally the war itself. [41] 

He carried his collection of dried seed pods in a leather satchel, each one labeled in Akkadian, a language as dead as the coral beneath the waves. [68] The pods rattled like old bones when he walked. [77] Once, armies had clashed here, turning the shore crimson until the reef's death poisoned their drinking water and forced both sides to abandon their claims. [103]

Now he came to fertilize what remained. [110]

The jetty stretched into water so still it mirrored the darkening sky perfectly, creating a narrow vastness that seemed to extend both up and down into infinity. [138] Gulls called overhead in patterns he had learned to read during his years driving the death-carts through Gloom-hill's plague seasons. [159] Their cries spoke of currents below, of nutrients gathering where the dead reef met the living shore. [176]

He knelt among the roses and spoke a Sumerian prayer of binding. [188] The birds answered in their ancient tongue, older than any human language, telling him where the earth hungered most. [207] This was the submerged concord between species: what died below would feed what grew above, and the garden would eat the battlefield whole. [231]

From his satchel, he withdrew pods of heart-vine, memorial grass, and forget-me-spite. [245] Each plant had been chosen for its aggressive nature, its ability to break apart stone fortifications and digest metal implements of war. [267] He pressed them into soil that still held shrapnel, whispering Etruscan growth-songs his grandmother had taught him before that language, too, joined the choir of the extinct. [296]

The gulls circled lower, their calls shifting pitch. [304] They spoke of phosphorus rising from the reef's skeleton, of nitrogen released from countless small deaths. [320] He understood their meaning: the water here had become a kind of liquid fertilizer, transformed by decomposition into something viciously fertile. [342]

He had driven his coach past these ruins for months before understanding what the place wanted. [357] The dead soldiers haunted Gloom-hill's cemetery, but their true ghosts were the weapons they'd left behind, the earthworks they'd carved, the scars they'd branded into the landscape. [384] The garden he planted would not honor them but consume them, digest their violence into beauty that would recognize no human purpose. [406]

As darkness gathered, he scattered the remaining pods across the jetty's broken planks. [419] Tomorrow, when the tide brought in more of the reef's dissolved minerals, the seeds would begin their work. [438] Within a season, vines would strangle the gun emplacements. [447] Within a year, flowers would crack open the ammunition dumps. [458] Within a decade, no one would remember why anyone had thought this shore worth killing for. [474]

The coachman stood and listened as the gulls' calls faded into night-hunting sounds: bats clicking their locations, owls announcing territories. [494] Each species sang its needs, and he translated them all into the placement of seeds, the promise of green chaos. [514]

This was his true work, learned in the narrow vastness between life and death he'd witnessed from his driver's seat. [534] The dying had taught him their languages as they expired, and now he used those tongues to speak new life into being. [556]

He turned from the blooming jetty and walked back toward Gloom-hill, where his horses waited. [571] Behind him, the first seeds were already splitting in the salt-sweet air, roots reaching down toward the reef's calcium embrace, shoots reaching up toward stars that had watched a thousand battles fade into flowers. [606] The submerged concord held: what humanity had broken apart in fury, nature would unite in hunger, until even the memory of war became nothing but especially fertile soil. [634]

His work here was done. [639] The garden would grow without him now, wild and unwitnessed, reclaiming the battlefield one bloom at a time. [656] By morning, his coach would carry new passengers up Gloom-hill, but tonight, he had given the dead reef one last gift: the promise that from its bones would rise something beautiful enough to make forgetting a mercy. [695]

The gulls, settling for the night, agreed. [702]
