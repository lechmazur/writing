Marcus had guarded the enchanted orchard for three centuries, his pressed penny collection the only proof that time still moved forward in this suspended realm. <words>20</words> Each copper disc bore the imprint of a different decade's lies—the Grand Deception of 1847, the Silent Betrayal of 1923, the Luminous Fraud of 2001—all cosmic tricks he'd witnessed but never prevented. <words>53</words> The living statues that policed the perimeter regarded him with limestone eyes, forever frozen at the threshold of an apology they'd never speak, their mouths half-open in perpetual almost-confession. <words>82</words>

As a vivid dreamer, Marcus experienced each night's visions with crystalline clarity, seeing the truth behind reality's elaborate stage production. <words>102</words> Tonight, he oscillated between the silver moon paths that crisscrossed the orchard, following their ethereal trails with the precision of someone who'd mapped every celestial deception. <words>128</words> His rationally mischievous nature compelled him to leave small pranks for the statues—repositioning their stone fingers into rude gestures, knowing they'd reset by dawn, trapped in their eternal pre-apology stance. <words>158</words>

The newest penny in his collection gleamed differently, its surface showing not a past lie but a future one: tomorrow's scheduled eclipse that wasn't an eclipse at all. <words>187</words> Marcus chuckled darkly, the sound echoing off apple trees that bore fruit in impossible colors—ultraviolet oranges, infrared greens—each one containing a seed of universal falsehood. <words>213</words> He'd been patient for so long, watching the cosmos spin its elaborate deceptions while humanity below mistook shadows for substance, gravity for love, time for truth. <words>240</words>

The moon paths pulsed brighter, and Marcus felt the familiar pull to oscillate faster between them, his form blurring as he traced their luminous geometry. <words>265</words> Each path revealed another layer of the grand cosmic joke—stars that were merely pinholes in heaven's cheap curtain, planets that were nothing but marbles in a deity's abandoned game. <words>295</words> The statues trembled slightly, sensing his growing understanding, their stone lips quivering with the weight of their unspoken sorry. <words>314</words>

But Marcus knew their apology would never come, just as he knew his guardianship would never end. <words>331</words> He pressed another penny, this one blank, waiting for tomorrow's revelation. <words>342</words> The orchard hummed with dark anticipation, its enchanted branches swaying to music only the thoroughly disillusioned could hear. <words>359</words> Perhaps tomorrow he'd finally unravel it all—the ultimate cosmic deception that kept him here, oscillating between moon paths, collecting pressed proof of lies, rationally plotting mischief against stone sentinels who couldn't speak their shame. <words>394</words> Until then, he'd continue his patient vigil, finding dour amusement in the absurdity of guarding truth in a universe built entirely on beautiful, terrible fiction. <words>419</words> The stars winked mockingly above, and Marcus winked back, knowing exactly what they really were. <words>434</words>
