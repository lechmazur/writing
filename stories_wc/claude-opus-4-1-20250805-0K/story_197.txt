The con artist lived seventeen branches up the World-Tree, where the bark spiraled into silver platforms and nightmares leaked through knotholes like tar. <20>

Each evening, during that precious hush after the last bedtime story echoed through the branches below, Marcel would begin his work. <39>

He wasn't stealing dreams tonight—he was composing something far more ambitious. <50>

The cosmic lullaby required ingredients that only existed where nightmares collide, those liminal spaces between one terror and another where reality wore thin. <74>

Marcel clutched the piece of fabric scrap he'd torn from a sleeper's pillowcase three nights ago, its threads still humming with residual peace. <98>

The mundanely terrifying part wasn't the nightmares themselves—those were predictable, almost comforting in their consistency. <114>

No, what truly unsettled him was the sticky notes. <123>

Someone had been leaving them on his branch, rearranged daily into different patterns, each configuration spelling out fragments of the lullaby he needed. <147>

Tonight's arrangement read: "WHEN THE VOID MOTHER SINGS, CHILDREN FORGET THEIR NAMES." <159>

Marcel unscrambled the words methodically, knowing that furthering his con required understanding who was helping him. <175>

The World-Tree groaned, its astronomical trunk adjusting to accommodate another billion sleeping minds. <189>

He pressed the fabric scrap against a weeping knothole where two nightmares—one about falling, another about drowning—merged into something neither. <210>

The collision point sang a note so pure it could have been mistaken for silence. <225>

Marcel recorded it in his bones, adding it to the seventeen other notes he'd collected. <241>

The sticky notes rearranged themselves while he watched: "YOU'RE NOT THE FIRST TO TRY." <255>

His hands trembled as he climbed higher, toward branches where even dreams feared to nest. <271>

The cosmic lullaby wasn't meant to soothe—it was meant to reset everything, to sing the universe back to its first quiet moment. <294>

Marcel had sold this promise to desperate parents whose children never slept, to insomniacs who'd forgotten what darkness looked like without teeth. <317>

But the con was on him. <323>

The sticky notes weren't warnings or assistance—they were the lullaby itself, fractured across dimensions, using him to reassemble. <342>

The fabric scrap began unraveling in his hand, each thread revealing another note of pristine chaos. <358>

As the final bedtime story's echo faded completely, Marcel understood: he wasn't composing the cosmic lullaby. <374>

He was becoming it. <378>

The World-Tree's highest branches beckoned, where nightmares didn't just collide but merged into something boundless and hungry. <396>

Marcel climbed further, sticky notes swirling around him like leaves, each one a measure of the song that would unmake everything, starting with himself. <421>

The fabric scrap dissolved entirely, and in that moment between one breath and forever, the con artist finally heard the universe's first word. <445>

It sounded exactly like a child's yawn. <452>
