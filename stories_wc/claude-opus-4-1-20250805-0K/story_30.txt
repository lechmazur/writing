Captain Zara's telekinetic dice floated between her fingers as she studied the navigation room's chaos—star charts overlapping ancient agricultural diagrams, both sacred and scattered. <words>19</words> The space pirates whispered secrets behind her, their voices mixing with the hum of quantum engines and the crackle of the ceremonial flame burning in its containment field. <words>47</words> 

She'd won the tapestry fragment three systems ago, its medieval dragons woven with threads that somehow preserved extinct Earth farming techniques in a lost language only she could read. <words>76</words> Her grandmother had been philosophically practical about such things: "Knowledge feeds more than bodies," she'd say, planting another tree in their family's orbital greenhouse for each grandchild born. <words>104</words> That tradition had saved seventeen colony worlds from starvation, each tree's genetic code carrying agricultural wisdom from before the Diaspora. <words>124</words>

"The Consortium's offering thirty million credits," her quartermaster murmured, eyeing the tapestry piece. <words>137</words> Zara's dice spun faster, responding to her agitation. <words>145</words> The dragons seemed to writhe in the firelight, their scales forming letters in dead Mesopotamian that described crop rotation patterns lost for millennia. <words>168</words>

"They want to lock it in a vault," she replied, her voice cutting through the navigation room's whispered negotiations. <words>188</words> "These methods could transform the frontier colonies." <words>195</words> Her crew shifted nervously; they were pirates, not philanthropists. <words>204</words> But Zara had learned from three generations of women who understood that true wealth grew from soil, not safes. <words>222</words>

The dice suddenly stopped spinning, hanging impossibly still in the air. <words>233</words> She'd made her decision with the same certainty her ancestors had chosen which seeds to save during Earth's final harvest. <words>253</words> "Plot a course for the agricultural stations," she commanded. <words>262</words> "We're going to translate this entire tapestry and broadcast it on open channels." <words>275</words>

Her first mate protested—it would mark them as targets, destroy their reputation among thieves. <words>289</words> But Zara touched the flame's containment field, letting its heat remind her of the ancient forges where humanity first learned to shape tools for tilling. <words>314</words> The navigation room fell silent except for the whispered prayers of her engineer, who remembered his own grandmother's stories of Earth's last gardens. <words>337</words>

"Some things are worth more than profit," Zara said, her telekinetic gift guiding the dice to trace the dragon's outline on the tapestry. <words>360</words> "My family planted trees for the future. <words>367</words> This knowledge is our seed." <words>372</words> She turned to her crew, these pirates who'd followed her through void and violence. <words>386</words> "We preserve what matters, even in chaos." <words>393</words> The sacred disorder of their existence suddenly had purpose. <words>402</words> 

The dice settled, showing all sixes—the gambler's blessing. <words>410</words> Tomorrow, forgotten wisdom would bloom across the stars. <words>418</words>
