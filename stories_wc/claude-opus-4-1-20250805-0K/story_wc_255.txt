The glassblower's courtyard shimmered with morning dew as Mira arranged chrysanthemums in precise spirals around the workshop entrance. [17] Each placement carried meaning in the old language of flowers that her grandmother had taught her—protection, warning, welcome. [32] As a colorblind painter, she had learned to see the world through texture and tone, through the subtle gradations that others overlooked. [53]

"Another trade?" asked Enzo, the glassblower, studying her latest canvas propped against his kiln. [67] The painting showed the city's destruction from three months ago, when the phoenix had risen from the municipal building's ashes, leaving half the district in ruins. [92] Where others saw tragedy, Mira had captured something else—the way broken glass caught light, how collapsed walls created new shadows. [112]

"I need more time in your courtyard," Mira said, her voice carrying an innocently cunning undertone. [128] "The light here awakens something in my work." [136]

Enzo laughed, but his eyes remained calculating. [143] Since the phoenix's awakening, everyone bartered for survival—money had lost meaning when banks burned. [157] "What else can you offer?" [162]

From her satchel, Mira produced a small metal piece—a concertina reed tongue she'd found in the rubble of the music hall. [184] "This still sings," she said, blowing across it gently. [194] The note hung in the air, pure despite its damaged housing. [206]

"Useless to me," Enzo said, though his fingers twitched toward it. [218]

Mira knew better. [221] She had seen him working late, trying to incorporate sound into his glass sculptures, failing each time. [239] She placed the reed tongue on his workbench and began rearranging the potted herbs along his window—rosemary shifted left, sage pulled forward, thyme tucked behind. [264] In the flower language, she was telling him about his daughter, who had left after the phoenix incident, whose letters he burned unopened. [288]

His face changed. [291] "How did you—" [294]

"I paint what I see," Mira said simply. [303] "Gray comes in infinite shades. [308] Your hands shake with one particular gray when you pass the music hall ruins." [323] She touched the reed tongue. [328] "She played concertina there, didn't she?" [335]

Enzo's shoulders sagged. [338] "Before everything changed." [342]

"The phoenix didn't just destroy," Mira said, adjusting a final sprig of lavender—forgiveness, in the old language. [359] "It revealed what was already broken." [366]

This was how she'd survived since the awakening—reading people through their movements, their possessions, the spaces they created. [384] Being colorblind had taught her to find beauty where others saw only damage, imperfection where others demanded wholeness. [403]

"Three months in my courtyard," Enzo said suddenly. [412] "Paint here whenever you like. [417] But I want you to teach me your flower language." [428]

Mira smiled, beginning to awaken to new possibilities. [436] "Why?" [437]

"My daughter—she was colorblind too," he admitted. [445] "I never understood how she saw the world. [454] After the phoenix, after she left, I started making only clear glass. [467] No more colors I couldn't explain to her." [476]

Over the following weeks, Mira painted in his courtyard while Enzo learned to speak through plant arrangements. [493] She showed him how morning glory meant affection, how baby's breath whispered of everlasting love. [509] He incorporated the concertina reed tongue into a glass sculpture that sang when the wind passed through it—a beckoning call. [530]

One day, Mira found him arranging peonies and jasmine by the courtyard gate—shame and separation, but also hope for reunion. [552] That evening, a young woman appeared, drawn by the familiar sound of the reed tongue singing through glass. [571]

"Papa?" she said, and Mira saw her eyes move across the flowers, reading their message. [587]

As father and daughter embraced, Mira painted the scene in her grays—the imperfect beauty of shattered things finding wholeness, the way awakening could be bartered not with objects but with understanding. [619] The phoenix had risen and burned their old world away, but in this glassblower's courtyard, surrounded by messages written in petals and leaves, something new and more honest had grown from the ashes. [652]

She added a final brushstroke—the concertina reed tongue, gleaming silver in the glass, proof that broken instruments could still make music. [674]
