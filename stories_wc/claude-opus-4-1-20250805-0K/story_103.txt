The weatherbeaten knight stood before the lighthouse prison's highest chamber, where waves crashed against the jagged reef below. <words>18</words> His gauntleted hand trembled over the brass door knocker, worn smooth by centuries of impossible choices made by those who'd stood here before. <words>41</words> Within the knocker's polished surface, he saw not his scarred face but a mirrored reflection where time moved differently—where his daughter still lived. <words>65</words>

Inside that brass mirror, she was arranging shells, dried flowers, and colored stones on their cottage table. <words>82</words> The knight's throat tightened as he began to appreciate what he'd missed: a set of seemingly random items that formed a pattern only she understood. <words>107</words> A blue shell for each day he'd been away at war. <words>118</words> A withered rose for every promise broken. <words>125</words> A white stone for each birthday celebrated alone. <words>133</words>

The pattern spelled out three words: "Papa, come home." <words>142</words>

He knocked once. <words>145</words>

The reflection rippled, and suddenly he was there, in that warm cottage, his armor dissolving like mist. <words>162</words> His daughter, forever eight years old in this prison of memory, looked up with eyes that held no reproach—only a grudgingly sweet forgiveness that burned worse than any wound. <words>191</words> "You're late," she said simply, pushing a chair toward him with one small foot. <words>205</words>

This was his torment, his joyful agony: the lighthouse prison offered one final mercy to its inmates. <words>222</words> Step through the reflection, and live in that perfect moment forever, but know it's false. <words>237</words> Or turn away, keeping the truth of her death intact, preserving the honor of real grief. <words>253</words>

Every knight who'd worn this brass knocker smooth had faced this impossible choice. <words>266</words> Most chose the lie. <words>270</words>

His daughter began humming their song—the one about brave knights and patient princesses. <words>283</words> Each note was perfectly placed to hush the final cry of regret that had echoed in his chest since the plague took her. <words>305</words> She offered him a white stone. <words>311</words> "For today," she said. <words>315</words> "For coming home." <words>318</words>

The knight's weathered fingers closed around the stone. <words>326</words> It felt real, warm, alive with possibility. <words>333</words> Outside the reflection, his body would waste away, another skeleton in the lighthouse's collection. <words>347</words> But here, in this eternal moment between heartbeats, between breaths, between the knock and the answer, he could be the father he'd failed to be. <words>372</words>

He sat down, armor clanking one last time before it faded completely. <words>384</words> "Tell me about your pattern, little one," he said, his voice breaking beautifully. <words>397</words>

She smiled, and began. <words>401</words>
