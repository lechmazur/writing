Marcus adjusted his denim jacket and stepped into the abandoned carnival prize booth, his telekinetic gift barely rippling the dust motes as he moved with strictly casual indifference. <words>27</words> The booth smelled of decades-old popcorn and broken dreams, but he'd tracked the artifact here—a single chopstick wrapper that supposedly held memories spanning across the tapestry of lost legends. <words>56</words> 

He floated it toward himself without touching it, knowing well that the price of knowledge often came disguised as innocuous trash. <words>77</words> The wrapper crinkled, and that tiny sound bite triggered the first flashback—a Japanese calligrapher in 1423, binding a book of forbidden transformations with threads soaked in phoenix tears. <words>106</words> Marcus stumbled but kept his composure, hands in pockets, as centuries of memory crashed through him. <words>122</words>

Another crinkle, another sound bite: a Roman scribe sealing papyrus with wax that contained ground philosopher's stone. <words>139</words> The flashbacks weren't just showing him history; they were trying to revive something dormant in his bloodline. <words>156</words> Each bookbinder before him had discovered pieces of the power of transformation, hiding their findings in the most mundane objects. <words>176</words>

The carnival booth's stuffed animals watched with button eyes as Marcus experienced a medieval monk illuminating manuscripts with ink that could alter reality itself. <words>200</words> The wrapper trembled in his telekinetic grip, its faded red characters pulsing like a heartbeat. <words>216</words> He saw his grandmother—also a bookbinder, also gifted—pressing this very wrapper into a cookbook in 1962, whispering that someday her descendant would understand. <words>240</words>

"Just a piece of paper," Marcus murmured, but his casual tone couldn't mask the weight of revelation. <words>257</words> The price of knowledge wasn't pain or sacrifice—it was the burden of understanding that every bookbinder through history had been preparing for this moment. <words>282</words> They'd hidden the secret of true transformation not in grimoires or temples, but in the overlooked detritus of everyday life. <words>302</words>

The final flashback hit: himself as a child, eating Chinese takeout at this very carnival, casually tossing this wrapper aside. <words>322</words> His grandmother had brought him here deliberately, planting the seed that would bloom decades later. <words>337</words> The power of transformation wasn't about changing matter or bending reality—it was about recognizing that the most profound magic had always lived in the ordinary. <words>363</words>

Marcus pocketed the wrapper with the same nonchalance he'd entered with, though now he understood why his ancestors had chosen such humble vessels for their legacy. <words>390</words> Walking out of the booth, he left the carnival's ruins behind, carrying within him the revived knowledge of a thousand bookbinders who'd paid the price before him. <words>418</words> The wrapper crinkled once more in his pocket, a quiet promise of transformations yet to come. <words>434</words>
