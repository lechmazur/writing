The feral ranger stood motionless in the dandelion field, her weathered hands gripping the brass balance scale that had arrived yesterday through code words in receipts from the village market. <words>29</words> "Three pounds of hope, two ounces of sorrow," the butcher's slip had read, while the baker's note whispered, "One loaf of tomorrow, paid in yesterday's coins." <words>56</words> She understood now—they were calling her to witness. <words>65</words>

In the distance, from the birthing hut at the field's edge, a newborn's first cry pierced the dawn. <words>83</words> Then came the pause. <words>87</words> That sacred, precisely random moment when the universe held its breath, deciding whether this soul would see the world through society's careful filters or with the raw, unfiltered perception that marked her own cursed gift. <words>124</words>

The ranger's fingers began to quiver against the scale's cold metal. <words>135</words> She had lived wild for seventeen years, cast out when her ability to see through all pretense—every lie, every social mask, every comfortable delusion—made her presence unbearable to civilized folk. <words>165</words> They called her feral, but she knew better; she was simply too honest for their constructed world. <words>183</words>

The scale's pans swayed without wind, measuring something invisible. <words>192</words> On one side materialized a golden seed of dandelion fluff, representing the child's potential for ordinary blindness, for fitting in, for happiness within boundaries. <words>216</words> On the other, a single drop of morning dew appeared—clear, reflecting everything, distorting nothing. <words>231</words>

She thought of her own childhood, before the awakening, when she could still pretend her father's tears were allergies, her mother's bruises were clumsiness. <words>255</words> The gift of seeing truth had been no gift at all, yet here she stood, ready to embrace the unknown with open arms, knowing this child might share her burden. <words>285</words>

The scale trembled, balanced perfectly. <words>290</words> The choice wasn't hers—it never was—but she could offer what no one had offered her: understanding. <words>306</words> If this child emerged with eyes that saw too much, the ranger would teach them to find beauty in unvarnished reality, to discover hope within truth's harsh edges. <words>335</words>

The pause stretched, eternal and instant. <words>341</words> Around her, thousands of dandelion seeds hung suspended, waiting to carry wishes that might never come true but were precious for the wishing nonetheless. <words>366</words> The scale tipped toward the dew. <words>372</words> Her heart sank and soared simultaneously—another soul would join her in the beautiful, terrible space between what is and what others pretend to be. <words>397</words>

The baby's second cry came, different from the first, carrying a note of ancient knowing. <words>412</words> The ranger smiled through tears, already walking toward the hut, ready to be the guide she never had. <words>430</words>
