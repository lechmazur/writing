Marina pressed the amber pendant against her chest, feeling the ancient mosquito trapped inside pulse with warmth against her diving-scarred fingers. <words>17</words> Every Halloween, her family gathered at the abandoned Pier 47 carnival, a tradition born from her grandmother's belief that the veil thinned where joy once lived. <words>43</words> This year, Marina came alone, stepping out of her late sister's shadow for the first time. <words>59</words>

The shooting gallery stood frozen in decay, its painted ducks forever mid-swim, rifles rusted in their chains. <words>76</words> Marina's gift—hearing the dead speak through water damage and salt corrosion—had always been secondary to Elena's ability to see them fully formed. <words>99</words> But Elena was gone now, lost to the very waters Marina dove. <words>111</words>

"You came," whispered a voice through the warped wooden counter. <words>121</words>

Marina recognized him immediately: Tommy Castellano, the carnival operator who'd drowned himself here in 1982, leaving behind a half-written suicide note she'd found tucked beneath the gallery's cash register. <words>149</words> Between those unfinished lines, she'd read his true story—not despair, but a fleeting rebellion against a life scripted by others. <words>169</words>

"I need to know something," Marina said, her voice carrying that joyfully melancholic tone of someone dancing with grief. <words>188</words> "Did you ever finish it?" <words>193</words>

Tommy's presence stirred the stale air, arousing memories embedded in the peeling paint: children's laughter, rigged games, stolen kisses behind the funhouse. <words>215</words> "The letter wasn't for reading," he said. <words>222</words> "It was for becoming." <words>226</words>

Marina understood then why the amber grew warm—it wasn't just an insect preserved, but a moment of defiant life frozen before surrender. <words>248</words> Like Tommy, who'd chosen his exit rather than accept the slow suffocation of expectations. <words>262</words> Like herself, always the practical diver while Elena communed with spirits, always the one who retrieved bodies while Elena retrieved souls. <words>283</words>

"Your sister knew," Tommy continued, his voice rippling like disturbed water. <words>294</words> "That's why she dove that day without you." <words>302</words> "She wanted you to have this—your own haunting, your own ghosts." <words>313</words>

Marina's heart, frozen since Elena's death, began its slow, painful thaw. <words>324</words> The amber mosquito had tried to escape the resin, wings spread in a final act of resistance. <words>341</words> Elena had tried to give Marina freedom through absence. <words>350</words> Tommy had written half a letter to leave room for others to finish their own stories. <words>366</words>

"The tradition continues," Marina whispered, setting the amber on the gallery counter where it caught the moonlight through broken roof slats. <words>387</words> "But differently now." <words>390</words>

She turned away from the gallery, feeling Tommy's grateful fade, knowing next Halloween she'd return—not to honor Elena's shadow, but to cast her own. <words>414</words> The half-written letter rustled in the wind, its blank spaces finally making sense. <words>428</words> Some stories gain power not from their endings, but from the courage to stop mid-sentence and let others write themselves free. <words>450</words>
