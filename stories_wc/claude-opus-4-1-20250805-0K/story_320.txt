The shy diviner Mara descended into the forgotten underwater city market, her waterproof satchel clutching vintage photographs that shouldn't exist. <words>18</words> Each image was confusingly clear—crystal sharp yet depicting events from timelines that had never intersected until now. <words>34</words> She moved through the algae-draped stalls with passionate disinterest, her heart racing while her face remained studiedly blank. <words>52</words> 

The echo of regret rippled through the parallel timelines like stones thrown into infinite ponds. <words>67</words> In one photograph, she saw herself laughing at this very market when it still breathed air, before the Great Submersion. <words>87</words> In another, she was drowning here while the market thrived above water, vendors hawking dimensional herbs she'd never learned to divine. <words>109</words>

Her phone, sealed in bio-membrane, buzzed with notifications. <words>117</words> The trail of social media posts had started three days ago—someone posting her photos across timelines, each tagged #TheMarketRemembers. <words>136</words> Every post precipitated another fracture in reality, another timeline bleeding into this one. <words>149</words> She'd traced them here, to the source of the cosmic imbalance that threatened to collapse all versions of herself into one impossible being. <words>173</words>

"You came," whispered the vendor at the pearl stall, though his lips didn't move in this timeline. <words>190</words> He existed in seven parallel markets simultaneously, selling regrets crystallized into luminous spheres. <words>203</words> Mara approached, her divination rods trembling. <words>209</words> She recognized him from the photographs—in one timeline, he'd been her mentor; in another, her destroyer. <words>226</words>

"The posts," she said quietly, "they're yours." <words>233</words>

He nodded, holding up a pearl that contained her own regret—the moment she'd chosen divination over love, replicated across infinite possibilities. <words>255</words> "Every timeline where you chose differently is collapsing. <words>263</words> The market remembers what you've forgotten." <words>269</words>

Mara understood then. <words>272</words> The photographs weren't just images but anchors, holding the timelines apart. <words>283</words> By posting them, he'd made the hidden truth visible: she existed in too many places, had divided herself too thin across realities in her desperate attempt to avoid choosing. <words>313</words> The cosmic imbalance wasn't external—she was the anomaly. <words>321</words>

With trembling hands, she spread the vintage photographs on his counter like tarot cards. <words>335</words> Each one dissolved as she touched it, releasing that version of herself back to its proper timeline. <words>352</words> The market shimmered, walls solidifying as realities untangled. <words>360</words> 

"Choose," the vendor said, offering the pearl of regret. <words>369</words>

She took it, feeling all her parallel selves collapse into one—shy, powerful, and finally whole in the underwater market where she'd always belonged. <words>393</words> The echo of regret transformed into acceptance, rippling outward through properly separated timelines. <words>406</words> Her phone went dark, the posts vanishing as the truth no longer needed revealing. <words>421</words> She was just Mara now, one diviner in one drowned market, balancing the cosmos by finally choosing to be herself. <words>441</words>
