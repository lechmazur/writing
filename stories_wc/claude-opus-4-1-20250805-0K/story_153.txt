Marcus had attended the University of New Erebus for twelve billion years, long enough to watch the last star burn out through the periscope feeds that connected the mole people's underground city to the dying surface. <words>30</words> His dissertation on immortality remained unfinished, a mundanely glorious pursuit that had outlasted civilizations, galaxies, and light itself. <words>48</words> 

The coal miner's headlamp sat on his desk, salvaged from the collapsed mine that had birthed this subterranean refuge eons ago. <words>69</words> It was his inheritance, his gifted burden—passed from the first refugees who'd fled underground when the sun began its death rattle. <words>91</words> Each bearer of the lamp became curator of memories, tasked with preserving what remained of human experience. <words>108</words>

Marcus worked with clinical precision, digitizing the travel journals that arrived weekly through the pneumatic tubes. <words>124</words> The mole people had developed this system of swapped journals centuries ago, each citizen recording their tunneling expeditions before trading notebooks with strangers. <words>148</words> Through this exchange, they built a collective map of their expanding darkness, a shared consciousness of stone and silence. <words>168</words>

He photographed each page under the headlamp's amber glow, the only light source that still functioned in the entropy-drunk universe. <words>189</words> The lamp ran on something beyond physics—hope, perhaps, or the stubborn refusal to accept endings. <words>205</words> Marcus uploaded the digitized journals to the University's quantum servers, where they formed constellations of data, new stars in the electronic void. <words>229</words>

His advisor, Professor Chen, had been dead for three million years, but Marcus continued submitting progress reports to her empty office. <words>251</words> "To master one's own reality," she'd written in her final note, "one must first catalog all possible realities." <words>270</words> So Marcus cataloged, with the detached devotion of a monk transcribing scripture in a monastery at the world's edge. <words>290</words>

The journals spoke of tunnel systems that defied geometry, of underground lakes that remembered rain, of citizens who'd forgotten their own names but recalled every poem they'd ever read. <words>320</words> Each entry was a fragment of the human story, preserved in the headlamp's circle of light. <words>337</words>

Marcus understood now why immortality remained elusive in his research. <words>347</words> It wasn't about living forever—the mole people had achieved that through sheer stubbornness. <words>361</words> It was about remembering forever, about carrying the weight of every gifted burden without breaking. <words>377</words> The headlamp flickered, as it did sometimes, reminding him that even inherited obligations could fail. <words>393</words>

He opened another journal, this one water-stained and written in a child's careful script. <words>408</words> "Today I saw a drawing of the sun," it began. <words>419</words> Marcus digitized it with the same steady hands that had photographed millions before, adding another thread to the tapestry of their buried eternity. <words>444</words> In the underground city of the mole people, this was his reality to master—one journal, one memory, one dying light at a time. <words>469</words>
