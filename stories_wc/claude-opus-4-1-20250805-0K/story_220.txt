The aloof page wandered through the towering labyrinth of shipping containers, their rust-eaten surfaces singing forgotten songs in the salt wind. <words>21</words> October had wounded the port city with storms, leaving crane operators idle and manifests scattered like autumn leaves. <words>38</words> She carried the deep-sea diver's logbook pressed against her ribs, its waterlogged pages holding more than coordinates—they held her grandfather's last attempt at reclaiming power from the consortium that had stolen his salvage patents. <words>72</words>

The page, known for being predictably odd in her methods, had spent weeks learning to reconstruct his faded entries using ultraviolet light and chemistry borrowed from restoration labs. <words>100</words> Today's ship had been delayed by fog, granting her unexpected hours among the containers where her grandfather once stored his diving equipment before everything was seized. <words>126</words>

She turned a corner and collided with an elderly woman carrying copper pipes. <words>139</words> "You have his eyes," the woman said, studying the page's face with recognition that sparked like flint. <words>156</words> This was Chen, her grandfather's former diving partner, who had vanished after testifying against him in court twenty years ago. <words>176</words>

"His logbook mentions you," the page said coldly, though her unstoppable curiosity burned through her practiced aloofness. <words>193</words> Chen's weathered hands trembled as she touched the book's spine. <words>204</words> "I was forced to lie," Chen whispered. <words>211</words> "They held my daughter's immigration papers hostage." <words>219</words> She pulled out a matching logbook from her satchel, its pages intact where the grandfather's were destroyed. <words>237</words>

Together they sat between containers painted with destinations neither would see—Mumbai, Rotterdam, Santos—and began reconstructing the truth. <words>254</words> Chen's entries revealed the location of the prototype breathing apparatus that would prove the patents were stolen. <words>271</words> The page's fingers traced coordinates with newfound purpose, her motivation to pierce illusions transforming into something sharper. <words>289</words>

As November approached with its promise of clearer skies, they planned their dive. <words>302</words> The consortium believed the prototype had been destroyed, but the logbooks, when overlapped like transparencies, revealed it waited forty fathoms down in a smuggler's cave her grandfather had marked with an anchor. <words>335</words>

The page stood among the containers, no longer aloof but allied, understanding that reclaiming power meant reconstructing not just evidence but trust itself. <words>359</words> Chen taught her the old diving signals while seagulls wheeled overhead, their cries mixing with the distant sound of ships' horns announcing arrivals that would change nothing and everything. <words>389</words> The wounded season was healing, and with it, the truth would surface like treasure brought up from the deep, authenticated by the very logbooks meant to be forgotten. <words>417</words>

Their innovative nostalgia—mixing modern forensics with traditional diving wisdom—would restore what was stolen. <words>431</words> The labyrinth of containers stood witness to their pact, shadows stretching long across the dock like the patient reach of justice delayed but not denied. <words>456</words>
