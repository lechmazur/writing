The wandering monk Kashin shuffled into the Dimension Door Repair Shop, his robes smelling of ozone and regret. <words>16</words> The proprietor, a three-armed entity named Vex, barely glanced up from welding a portal frame that sang funeral dirges. <words>34</words>

"Another broken door?" <words>37</words> Vex's voice carried the cynical warmth of someone who'd seen too many travelers chase impossible dreams. <words>53</words> "Let me guess—you tried forcing it open during the Convergence." <words>64</words>

Kashin produced a rusty skeleton key, its teeth worn from opening doors between worlds that should have stayed locked. <words>83</words> "The cosmic alignment happens once every thousand years," he said, his tone lightly unbearable with hope and exhaustion. <words>101</words> "I need to capture it before—" <words>107</words>

"Before it passes, yes." <words>111</words> Vex examined the key, which hummed with collected haunted melodies from dimensions where music had died. <words>127</words> "You've been using this to gather resonances, haven't you?" <words>136</words> "Each ghost song weakens the barriers." <words>142</words>

The shop trembled as another reality reformation swept through—the period of radical change was crushing old certainties daily. <words>160</words> Vex's extra arm steadied a shelf of bottled possibilities while continuing the repair work. <words>175</words> "You know what you're risking?" <words>180</words>

"The ties of forged trust," Kashin admitted. <words>187</words> "Every door I've opened, every person who helped me reach them—I've betrayed them all by stealing their dimensional frequencies." <words>207</words>

Vex's welding torch paused. <words>211</words> "And yet you continue." <words>215</words>

"The Convergence will reveal the universe's true name," Kashin said. <words>225</words> "With that knowledge, I could heal the fractures, stop the changes from crushing everything we know." <words>241</words>

"Or you could make it infinitely worse." <words>248</words> Vex resumed working, sparks reflecting off ancient scars. <words>256</words> "I've repaired doors for prophets, madmen, and everything between." <words>265</words> "The ones who succeed are rarely the ones who deserve to." <words>276</words>

Kashin watched the portal frame slowly mend, its funeral songs shifting to lullabies. <words>289</words> "Perhaps that's why monks wander—we're looking for doors we're meant to fail at opening." <words>304</words>

"Philosophy won't pay for repairs." <words>309</words> Vex's three hands moved in practiced synchronization. <words>316</words> "But that key will." <words>320</words> "It's collected enough haunted melodies to power my shop through the changes." <words>332</words>

The monk hesitated, then placed the key on the workbench. <words>342</words> "Take it." <words>344</words> "Maybe some doors should remain mysteries." <words>350</words>

Vex's expression softened with that particular brand of cynical warmth reserved for those who finally understand. <words>366</words> "The Convergence isn't going anywhere, monk." <words>372</words> "It's already here, in every choice to stop chasing." <words>381</words> "Your door's ready." <words>384</words>

Kashin stepped through the repaired portal, no longer pursuing the cosmic event but finally capturing something more elusive—peace with incompleteness. <words>404</words> Behind him, Vex crushed the skeleton key, releasing its stolen songs back into the universe where they belonged. <words>422</words>
