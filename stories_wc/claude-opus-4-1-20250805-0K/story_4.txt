The greenhouse pulsed with borrowed starlight, its glass panels collecting cosmic radiation from dimensions where suns still burned. <words>18</words> DJ Thalia pressed her vintage pencil case against the turntables, feeling the leather warm as Thoth whispered through her fingertips. <words>37</words> During filing season, when reality's paperwork overwhelmed the universe's clerks, the boundaries thinned enough for her to channel properly. <words>56</words> 

She'd inherited the pencil case from her grandmother, a cartographer of sacred spaces who'd mapped temples that existed only in dreams. <words>78</words> Inside, ancient graphite sticks hummed with traditionally playful energy—tools that drew lines between worlds with the mischief of trickster gods. <words>98</words> Tonight, she needed to map the alchemical orchard greenhouse, this impossible garden thriving in endless night where golden apples grew from silver branches. <words>121</words>

Her flickering vision began as she mixed the first track, overlaying Mesopotamian chants with synthesized starwhale songs. <words>138</words> The vision stuttered like a film reel catching fire: glimpses of root systems spelling divine names, fruit that contained entire galaxies. <words>160</words> Through her headphones, Hermes laughed, and she felt her movements become liquid mercury. <words>174</words>

The sweater she wore—knitted from threads of recorded prayers—began unraveling at the hem. <words>188</words> She didn't stop it; instead, she watched the thread trace a route across the greenhouse floor, weaving between phosphorescent mushroom circles and pools of liquid moonlight. <words>215</words> The thread knew what she sought: the spots where divine presence pooled like honey in a cosmic comb. <words>233</words>

As her hands worked the crossfader, exalting each beat into a prayer, the pencil case opened itself. <words>250</words> A single pencil rolled out, its wood carved from the first tree that ever laughed. <words>266</words> The unraveling thread wrapped around it, and suddenly Thalia understood—she wasn't just the DJ, she was the stylus on reality's record. <words>288</words>

The flickering vision stabilized as she scratched a backwards beat, reversing time in four-bar loops. <words>303</words> Each rewind revealed another layer of the greenhouse's sacred geometry: spiral paths that mimicked nautilus shells, corners where angels had signed their names in condensation. <words>328</words>

Her grandmother's pencil began drawing without her hand, following the thread's route, sketching maps that would only make sense to those who danced. <words>351</words> The alchemical trees responded, their branches rearranging into musical staves where notes grew like fruit. <words>367</words>

By dawn—though dawn never came to this place—she'd mapped seventeen sacred spaces, each one a remix of heaven. <words>386</words> The gods withdrew as filing season ended, but they left her a gift: in her vintage pencil case, a new tool appeared. <words>408</words> It was a stylus made from crystallized laughter, perfect for scratching records that would make even deities dance. <words>426</words> She smiled, traditionally playful herself now, and cued up the next track. <words>438</words>
