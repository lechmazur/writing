Marcus stood at the greenhouse entrance, fingers tracing the faded photograph tucked beneath his uniform's chest plate. <words>16</words> Twenty years protecting the Ambassador's daughter had calcified him into something barely human—until this lunar assignment cracked him open. <words>34</words>

The greenhouse perched on Shackleton Crater's edge, its transparent dome revealing Earth's distant blue marble. <words>49</words> Inside, genetically modified oaks and maples created an impossible autumn park, their leaves eternally golden beneath artificial suns. <words>67</words> The Ambassador insisted Lucia visit daily, claiming the trees helped her breathe easier in the recycled atmosphere. <words>84</words> Marcus knew better—control masqueraded as care. <words>90</words>

During these mandatory park visits, Marcus began collecting fragments of overheard stories from the botanists. <words>105</words> "The trees remember Earth," one whispered. <words>111</words> "Their DNA carries memories of real seasons," said another. <words>120</words> Each snippet revealed how life persisted despite artificial constraints, how nature remained serendipitously stubborn against human design. <words>137</words>

The photograph showed his daughter—dead these fifteen years, or so the Ambassador claimed. <words>151</words> But yesterday, a maintenance worker mentioned a girl in Sector Seven who sang old Earth lullabies, the same ones Marcus once hummed. <words>173</words> His rage crystallized into something pure and cold, like lunar ice. <words>184</words>

"She needs air," Lucia said suddenly, touching an oak's trunk. <words>194</words> At nineteen, she'd inherited her mother's ability to see through facades. <words>205</words> "Not this recycled nothing—real air." <words>210</words>

Marcus understood she meant freedom. <words>215</words> The Ambassador's latest decree required them to ratify Lucia's engagement contract tomorrow, binding her to Mars Colony's governor. <words>232</words> Another cage, another calculation. <words>236</words>

"The botanists say these trees are dying," Marcus said carefully, his voice steady as vacuum. <words>251</words> "But underground, their roots intertwine, sharing nutrients, waiting." <words>259</words> He pulled out the photograph, showing her the child's face. <words>269</words> "Sometimes what seems dead is merely sleeping." <words>276</words>

Lucia's eyes widened—she recognized something in those features. <words>284</words> The same stubborn chin, the same defiant eyes that met hers in mirrors. <words>297</words>

"The transport shuttle launches in three hours," Marcus continued. <words>306</words> "Security codes change during the ceremony tomorrow." <words>313</words> His decades of protection had taught him every weakness in the Ambassador's system. <words>326</words>

She nodded, understanding blooming like Earth flowers in lunar soil. <words>336</words> "And Sector Seven?" <words>339</words>

"Has answers," he confirmed. <words>343</words> The stories he'd gathered painted a picture: a hidden community of supposedly dead relatives, kept as leverage. <words>360</words> His daughter lived—he felt it with the same certainty that brought spring after winter. <words>375</words>

They stood together in the artificial autumn, planning their timely rebirth. <words>386</words> The serenity of Marcus's anger had transformed into something else—purpose. <words>396</words> Tomorrow, while the Ambassador waited for signatures, they would vanish like morning frost, leaving only empty contracts and the eternal golden leaves as witnesses to their escape. <words>424</words>

The greenhouse hummed with recycled life, but beyond the crater's edge, real freedom beckoned. <words>438</words> Marcus tucked the photograph away, feeling lighter than he had in twenty years. <words>451</words> Some chains, once recognized, simply dissolved. <words>457</words>
