The abandoned medical bay of Station Epsilon-7 drifted through the cosmos, its walls still echoing with memories of healing and hope. <words>18</words> Inside, Marcus Chen arranged his wares with practiced care—a forthright peddler who'd chosen this forgotten place as his unlikely sanctuary. <words>36</words>

His most precious possession sat centered on the rusted examination table: a dried flower bouquet, each brittle petal holding fragments of his past life as a healer. <words>63</words> Once, he'd sworn a blood oath to the Medical Collective, promising never to practice medicine outside their monopolistic grip. <words>82</words> Breaking that oath meant death, but staying meant watching them divide healthcare between those who could pay and those who couldn't. <words>103</words>

While the universe hummed its secret song—that eternal vibration only the lonely truly hear—Marcus worked by the glow of emergency lighting. <words>125</words> He'd become meekly assertive in his rebellion, selling medical supplies to desperate colonists at fair prices, never pushing, always retreating when Collective enforcers appeared. <words>149</words> His redemption's path wound through these small acts of defiance, each transaction a tiny victory against the system that had corrupted his calling. <words>173</words>

The dried flowers had belonged to his mentor, Dr. Sarah Vale, who'd died refusing treatment she couldn't afford under the very system she'd helped create. <words>198</words> Marcus kept them as a reminder, their faded beauty somehow more honest than the fresh blooms that once adorned Collective hospitals. <words>219</words>

His days began by sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns transmitted from nearby stations, searching for mentions of medical emergencies the Collective had ignored. <words>241</words> "Miner's daughter, lung infection, Sector Nine," he'd read, and within hours, antibiotics would mysteriously appear at their doorstep, payment optional. <words>261</words>

The joyful loneliness suited him—a contradiction he'd learned to embrace. <words>271</words> Joy in knowing each medicine he distributed was a life potentially saved; loneliness in understanding he could never return to legitimate practice. <words>294</words> The medical bay's ghosts were his only colleagues now, and they judged him far less harshly than the living ever had. <words>316</words>

Tonight, as starlight filtered through cracked viewports, a young couple arrived seeking prenatal vitamins the Collective deemed "non-essential" for their income bracket. <words>338</words> Marcus divided his remaining supply, giving them most while keeping just enough for the next desperate soul. <words>355</words> They tried to pay, but he waved them off with that meekly assertive gesture he'd perfected—firm enough to refuse, gentle enough not to wound their pride. <words>381</words>

As they departed, gratitude shining in their eyes, Marcus touched the dried bouquet and smiled. <words>396</words> His oath might be broken, but his purpose had never been clearer. <words>408</words> The universe continued humming its secret song, and Marcus Chen, forthright peddler of hope, hummed along. <words>424</words>
