The clandestine watchman pressed his fingers against the braille-like bumps on the battered briefcase, reading secrets that theater audiences would never know. <words>18</words> After the cast takes their final bow on stage each night, Marcus slips through shadows to the abandoned repair bay beneath the opera house, where broken set pieces wait among rusted airship parts. <words>50</words> 

His grandfather's airship captain's goggles hang around his neck, their brass frames tarnished but lenses still sharp enough to pierce illusions. <words>72</words> The briefcase's raised patterns tell him everything: which performances truly ended, which merely pretended to conclude. <words>88</words> Marcus learned long ago that finality is theater's greatest lie. <words>98</words>

Tonight's bumps form a different message entirely. <words>105</words> His fingers trace the warning three times, analytically free from the panic that might cloud lesser minds. <words>122</words> The lead actress hasn't returned to her dressing room. <words>131</words> She's discovered what Marcus protects—the portal hidden behind the repair bay's oil-stained curtains, where departed performances live on eternally. <words>151</words>

He finds her standing before the shimmering threshold, still wearing her death scene costume, mascara streaking her cheeks like war paint. <words>172</words> "You can't stop me," she whispers, voice crackling with prickly wonder at the impossibility before her. <words>188</words> Through the portal, she sees herself taking infinite bows, receiving endless roses, dying beautifully forever. <words>203</words>

"That's not wilderness wisdom," Marcus says quietly, adjusting his grandfather's goggles to see what she cannot. <words>219</words> Beyond the eternal applause writhe the hollow shells of actors who chose never-ending encores over life's necessary exits. <words>237</words> "The wild teaches us that endings feed beginnings." <words>245</words>

She turns, studying his scarred hands, the briefcase with its mysterious topography of truth. <words>259</words> "You're the one who removes props before actors can steal them back." <words>271</words>

Marcus acknowledges this with the slightest nod. <words>278</words> For decades, he's prevented performers from defying the laws of finality, protecting them from fates worse than forgotten lines. <words>297</words> The repair bay holds more than broken scenery—it guards the boundary between preservation and putrefaction. <words>313</words>

"My grandfather flew airships between worlds," he explains, touching the goggles reverently. <words>325</words> "He taught me that navigation requires accepting destinations, even when they're endings." <words>337</words> The briefcase hums against his palm, its bumps reshaping to record her choice. <words>351</words>

She steps back from the portal, something wild and wise flickering in her eyes. <words>365</words> "Tomorrow night, I'll take my final bow differently." <words>373</words>

Marcus watches her leave, knowing she'll return to the stage transformed, carrying wilderness wisdom in her performance. <words>390</words> The portal dims as he locks the repair bay, his vigil complete until tomorrow's curtain falls. <words>407</words> Some endings, he's learned, are worth protecting precisely because they end. <words>418</words>
