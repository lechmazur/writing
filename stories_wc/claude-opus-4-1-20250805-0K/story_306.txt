Delilah Starweather, once Hollywood's most bankable twelve-year-old, pressed her crumpled treasure map against the cathedral window of the vibration analysis chamber. <words>19</words> The map—drawn in eyeliner on a cocktail napkin during her third stint in rehab—promised something better than sobriety or comeback tours: raw, unfiltered madness. <words>42</words>

The chamber hummed with frequencies that made her fillings ache, but Delilah had paid the university's night janitor two grand to look the other way. <words>68</words> After twenty years of chasing normal, of therapy and yoga and artisanal kombucha, she'd finally accepted what made her authentically odd: she could see things others couldn't when sound waves hit just right. <words>101</words>

"The price of ambition," her mother had called it when seven-year-old Delilah first mentioned the colors bleeding from people's mouths when they lied on set. <words>126</words> Now, at thirty-two, she understood it wasn't the ambition that cost her—it was suppressing the gift that came with it. <words>147</words>

She cranked the frequency generator higher, watching the stained glass window—stolen from a demolished psychiatric hospital—begin to vibrate. <words>166</words> Light started to trickle through the hidden layers of etched glass, revealing patterns the original artist had carved between the colored panes. <words>189</words> Medieval monks, she'd learned, had hidden their visions in cathedral windows, encoding madness as holiness. <words>204</words>

The patterns writhed like living things, and Delilah laughed—a sound somewhere between worship and vandalism. <words>220</words> This was it: the wild magic of madness her treasure map had promised, not in some mystical location but in the intersection of sound, light, and a mind willing to crack open. <words>253</words>

As the vibrations peaked, the window revealed its final secret—not words or images, but a frequency, a specific resonance that made her skull sing. <words>278</words> She recognized it immediately: the same pitch that had haunted her dreams since childhood, the one she'd heard between takes when the studio lights buzzed too bright. <words>306</words>

After the last secret is revealed, there's supposed to be silence. <words>317</words> But Delilah found something else: a roaring quietude that contained every role she'd never played, every normal moment she'd failed to achieve, transformed into something magnificent. <words>344</words> The treasure wasn't sanity or insanity—it was the liminal space between them where former child stars and medieval mystics and midnight trespassers all converged. <words>368</words>

She folded the map carefully, reverently, irreverently. <words>375</words> Tomorrow, the tabloids would probably run another "Where Are They Now?" piece about her. <words>390</words> Let them. <words>392</words> She'd found what she'd been looking for in the space between sound waves and stained glass, between ambition and madness, between who she was supposed to be and who she authentically was. <words>425</words> The window continued its ancient song, and Delilah Starweather, formerly famous, finally free, sang back. <words>440</words>
