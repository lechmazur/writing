Marcus stood at his post in the magnetic field observatory, watching the monitors with the practiced ease of someone who'd never failed—not once. <words>19</words> The spinning top on his desk whirled endlessly, a gift from his grandmother who'd warned him about pride before falls. <words>38</words> Tonight, the electromagnetic readings flickered between impossible values, each surge opening hairline fractures in reality itself. <words>54</words>

Through these tears, Marcus caught glimpses—other observatories, other versions of himself. <words>65</words> In one, he wore a general's uniform; in another, prison stripes. <words>76</words> Each Marcus guarded the same secret: the magnetic anomaly wasn't natural but artificially authentic, manufactured by the Council to seem organic while hiding something far more sinister. <words>103</words>

The Council had stationed him here, their most decorated sentinel, believing his arrogance would blind him to the truth. <words>122</words> They were wrong. <words>125</words> For months, he'd documented their deception, preparing to expose them—to steal thunder from the gods of mediocrity who ruled through comfortable lies. <words>148</words>

A sudden surge made him yelp as electricity arced across his console. <words>160</words> The parallel glimpses intensified, showing him standing in this exact spot across infinite realities. <words>174</words> In half of them, he'd already pressed the emergency broadcast button, alerting the world. <words>189</words> In the other half, he remained silent, loyal to the Council. <words>200</words>

The spinning top wobbled but didn't fall. <words>207</words> Marcus understood now—his grandmother had been a sentinel too, had faced this same choice. <words>222</words> The top was her way of warning him about this moment, before the first tear is shed, when everything still felt reversible. <words>244</words>

Through the fractured realities, he saw the consequences branching outward. <words>254</words> Expose the Council, and humanity would panic, societies would crumble, but truth would reign. <words>269</words> Stay silent, and the comfortable lie would persist, keeping billions safely ignorant while the Council's power grew absolute. <words>287</words>

The monitors showed another surge building—this one would be visible worldwide, impossible to hide. <words>302</words> The Council was counting on him to activate the dampening field, to maintain their artificial authenticity one more time. <words>321</words> His finger hovered over two buttons: one would expose everything, the other would preserve the illusion. <words>338</words>

The parallel glimpses showed him both futures simultaneously, each equally real until he chose. <words>352</words> The spinning top finally slowed, teetering between standing and falling, just like his loyalty—caught between duty to truth and duty to stability. <words>375</words>

Marcus smiled, recognizing the mysterious familiarity of this moment—every sentinel before him had stood here, torn between conflicting loyalties. <words>393</words> The overconfident guardian had become the uncertain human, and perhaps that was the real test all along. <words>410</words> He pressed the button, knowing that some truths are worth the chaos they bring. <words>425</words> The magnetic field erupted with genuine anomalies, washing away the Council's careful artifice forever. <words>439</words> The top fell, rolled, and went still. <words>446</words>
