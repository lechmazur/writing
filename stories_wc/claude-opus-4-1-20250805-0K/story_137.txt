The temple floated among clouds so dense that morning never quite arrived, only shifted from grey to pearl. <words>15</words> Mei worked as the gift shop's cashier, though few pilgrims climbed this high anymore. <words>28</words> She was a subtle illusionist—not the flashy kind who made tigers disappear, but one who could make you remember conversations that never happened, or forget the color of your mother's eyes. <words>60</words>

Each evening, at the hush after she closed out the register, counting coins with casually intense precision, she would unfold the antique lace her grandmother had left her. <words>88</words> The pattern wasn't just decorative; instructions were woven into its knots and loops, written in a script that hurt to read directly. <words>110</words> "To learn the language of the heart," the lace whispered when held to candlelight, "one must first understand what grows beneath." <words>131</words>

The understory grows—this was the first lesson. <words>139</words> Not the mighty trees that everyone noticed, but the ferns and mosses, the fungi threading through soil, the small persistent life that actually held the forest together. <words>167</words> Mei understood this meant the unspoken words between people, the glances that carried more weight than speeches, the silence that said everything. <words>189</words>

She kept the lace pressed flat with an unmarked binder clip she'd found in the temple's lost-and-found years ago. <words>209</words> The clip had belonged to someone important—she could feel it in the way it hummed against her fingers—but their identity remained hidden, another lesson in subtlety. <words>237</words>

Tonight, she needed to rekindle something that had gone cold between her and her sister, who served tea in the temple's upper chambers. <words>261</words> They hadn't fought, exactly; they'd simply stopped seeing each other, even when passing in the narrow corridors. <words>279</words> The lace pattern showed her how: she would weave an illusion so gentle it wouldn't feel like magic at all. <words>300</words>

Following the instructions, she created not false memories but highlighted real ones—the time they'd shared persimmons in the rain, their mother braiding both their hair with one ribbon, the made-up language they'd spoken as children. <words>337</words> These moments would shimmer just slightly in her sister's peripheral vision tomorrow, like dust motes catching unexpected sun. <words>355</words>

The work exhausted her, this careful cultivation of the understory of love. <words>367</words> She maintained her doleful cheer, the particular mood of the temple where joy and sorrow mixed like incense smoke. <words>387</words> By dawn, she'd planted enough small recognitions to grow into something larger. <words>399</words> When her sister brought her tea the next morning, they would remember how to speak without words, heart to heart, in the language that grows beneath everything else. <words>428</words> The unmarked binder clip held the lace pattern closed, keeping its secrets safe until the next evening's hush. <words>446</words>
