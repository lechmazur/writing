Before time unfurled its first thread, when existence was merely potential waiting to become, there stood a swamp fortress accessible only by gondola across the primordial waters. <words>24</words> Lady Marwen, an aristocrat who had shed her titles to live incognito among the common folk, poled her weathered craft through the mist. <words>46</words> At her feet lay a basket of vintage wine bottles, each containing a message that would chronicle the stories of villages that had yet to exist. <words>72</words>

The fortress loomed ahead, where the Authority dwelt—that ancient force that sought to predetermine every tale that would ever be told once the universe began. <words>97</words> Marwen had discovered something peculiar about herself in this pre-existence: she was strangely honest, unable to craft fiction even in this realm where truth had no meaning yet. <words>125</words> This curse-gift meant that every village story she collected and bottled was somehow real, would become real, despite existing before reality itself. <words>147</words>

Inside the fortress, the Authority's servants worked tirelessly to subjugate all potential narratives, weaving them on cosmic looms into predetermined patterns. <words>168</words> But Marwen had smuggled in her rustic yarn swift, a simple wooden device that looked primitive compared to their grand machines. <words>190</words> When she set it spinning in the great hall, the servants stopped, mesmerized by its honest simplicity. <words>207</words>

"You cannot control what hasn't begun," she said, her voice carrying humble defiance as she unwound their perfect threads onto her swift. <words>229</words> "These stories belong to the villages that will birth them, not to your grand design." <words>244</words>

The Authority materialized, formless yet overwhelming. <words>250</words> "You dare challenge the order we're establishing for all time to come?" <words>262</words>

Marwen continued working, transferring their rigid narratives to her swift, where they loosened and breathed. <words>277</words> "I'm merely an observer," she replied with that strange honesty that made even her humility ring true. <words>294</words> "I chronicle what will be, not what you wish to be." <words>305</words>

She released the bottles into the swamp waters, each one carrying a village's authentic future story. <words>321</words> The messages would drift through the void, waiting for the universe to begin, ready to find their destined settlements. <words>340</words> The Authority's servants found themselves unable to stop her—her rustic tool had unraveled their certainty. <words>355</words>

As she poled away in her gondola, Marwen knew she had won a small victory. <words>370</words> The villages would have their own stories, unscripted and true, recorded by an aristocrat who chose obscurity over power. <words>389</words> In challenging authority before authority even existed, she had ensured that some threads of fate would remain forever free, spinning on the swift of possibility. <words>414</words>
