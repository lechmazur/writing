Marcus had smuggled everything from rare minerals to banned literature, but never a pressed butterfly that sang. <words>15</words> The drought prediction center's sterile walls hummed with computers calculating rainfall probabilities, an ironic backdrop for his most peculiar delivery. <words>34</words> He moved with meticulously impulsive precision—every spontaneous gesture actually calculated, every casual lean against the wall deliberately positioned near exits. <words>55</words>

"The painter's coming out of surgery," Dr. Chen announced, her voice cutting through the center's perpetual buzz of meteorological data streams. <words>76</words> Marcus followed her to the medical wing, where the center's artist-in-residence lay recovering from an emergency appendectomy. <words>93</words> The man had been commissioned to create murals depicting historical drought patterns, but now he babbled under anesthesia's loosening grip. <words>113</words>

"The butterflies remember every song," the painter slurred, eyes unfocused. <words>123</words> "Pressed them myself... between glass... each wing holds a melody from the rain ceremonies." <words>137</words>

Marcus felt his cautious nature wrestle with sudden interest—this was why his client wanted the butterfly. <words>154</words> The delirious confessions continued: "My grandmother... she could predict droughts by listening to their music... taught me before the government took over with their machines." <words>180</words>

Dr. Chen checked monitors with practiced indifference, embodying the center's culture of enthusiastic apathy—passionately devoted to data while emotionally detached from its human implications. <words>204</words> "He's been saying this for twenty minutes," she shrugged. <words>213</words> "Something about encoding atmospheric pressure changes into butterfly wings through sound waves during preservation." <words>227</words>

Marcus touched the hidden pocket containing the pressed butterfly, feeling its peculiar warmth. <words>240</words> His fingers detected subtle vibrations—musical memories trapped in chitin and scale. <words>251</words> The painter's confession revealed what Marcus had been transporting: not mere contraband, but a forgotten technology of prediction through empathy with nature. <words>274</words>

"They sing of coming rain," the painter whispered, tears sliding down his cheeks. <words>288</words> "Or silence for the droughts... you have to feel what they felt, become the storm they danced in." <words>306</words>

This was Marcus's unexpected crossroads. <words>311</words> He could complete the delivery for his usual fee, or he could listen—truly listen—to what the butterfly remembered. <words>329</words> His meticulously impulsive nature chose for him; he withdrew the specimen and held it to his ear. <words>346</words>

The melody was fragmentary but unmistakable: three days of rain, starting tomorrow. <words>358</words> The computers hadn't predicted it, but the butterfly's musical memory was certain. <words>371</words> Marcus realized his client wasn't collecting art but seeking masters of an older empathy, those who could predict through feeling rather than calculation. <words>395</words>

He left the pressed butterfly on the painter's bedside table. <words>405</words> Some smuggling jobs paid in currency; this one paid in understanding. <words>416</words> Walking past the center's drought maps, Marcus smiled—tomorrow's rain would surprise everyone except him, the painter, and a butterfly that remembered. <words>439</words>
