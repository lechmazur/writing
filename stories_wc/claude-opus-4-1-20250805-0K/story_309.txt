Detective Marcus Chen stood in the Vanishing Point Gallery, that pretentious morgue of modern art, during the hush that follows the final siren—when the fire trucks had already given up and gone home. <words>31</words> Oh, how delightful that the city's cultural crown jewel had nearly burned down, leaving him to investigate insurance fraud at three in the morning while normal people dreamed of better lives. <words>60</words> He was confidently unsure about everything these days: certain the case stank of arson, uncertain why he still cared after twenty years of watching criminals waltz away on technicalities. <words>88</words> The half-damaged kaleidoscope installation in the corner still functioned, its melted edges courtesy of tonight's excitement, throwing fractured images across the smoke-stained walls like memories refusing to die properly. <words>117</words> Marcus began to rummage through the debris near the installation, his latex gloves turning gray with ash, searching for evidence that would help him outdance a looming inevitability—his forced retirement in six weeks. <words>149</words> The department had made it crystal clear: old dogs don't learn new tricks, they get put down humanely with a pension and a gold watch nobody wanted. <words>176</words> His fingers found something unexpected beneath a fallen frame—a single playing card, the Queen of Hearts, pristine despite the chaos, mocking him with her serene smile. <words>203</words> He held it up to the kaleidoscope's broken lens, and through its fleeting images, he saw her face multiplied and fractured: Sarah, his partner, who'd died in this exact gallery five years ago during another "accidental" fire. <words>240</words> The impact of memories hit him like a sucker punch wrapped in silk—how she'd laughed at this very installation, calling it "overpriced broken glass for people with more money than sense." <words>271</words> The Queen of Hearts had been her calling card, left at every crime scene she'd solved, a theatrical flourish he'd found insufferable until the day they stopped appearing forever. <words>300</words> Now here it was, untouched by flames, placed deliberately where only he would think to look, because whoever killed her knew he'd come back, knew he'd never let it go. <words>330</words> The kaleidoscope kept spinning its damaged dance, fragmenting reality into possibilities: Sarah alive, Sarah dead, Sarah warning him, Sarah mocking him from beyond. <words>353</words> Marcus pocketed the card with the kind of exhausted resignation that comes from recognizing destiny's sick sense of humor—he'd been investigating the wrong fire all along. <words>380</words> The real arsonist hadn't come for the gallery tonight; they'd come for him, using his memories as kindling, knowing that an overworked detective burns brightest just before he burns out completely. <words>411</words> He walked toward the exit, each footstep echoing in the emptiness, understanding finally that some inevitabilities weren't meant to be outdanced—they were meant to be embraced with whatever molten sarcasm one could muster against the dying light. <words>449</words>
