Lord Pemberton trimmed the hedges outside the abandoned greenhouse, his aristocratic hands fumbling with the shears as befitted someone utterly submissive to his handlers' cover story. <words>20</words> The secret agent workshop hidden beneath the estate's garden shed thrummed with activity, its echo chambers amplifying every whispered briefing through the ventilation grates. <words>43</words> 

"Shame about the cat," he heard Agent Morris say. <words>52</words> "Protocol says we liquify all biological evidence before the extraction tonight." <words>63</words>

Pemberton's unusually perceptive nature caught the tremor in Morris's voice—the man despised this part. <words>78</words> Through silent empathy, Pemberton understood what others missed: even hardened operatives mourned small sacrifices. <words>92</words> 

The stray tabby had wandered into the workshop three days ago, likely through the same ventilation shaft now betraying secrets. <words>112</words> Pemberton had seen her yesterday, curled beneath the chemical tanks. <words>122</words> 

"Well, orders are orders," he muttered to his roses with earnest flippancy, knowing the surveillance team would expect his usual vapid commentary. <words>145</words> "Though one does wonder if headquarters considers how dreadfully boring proper gardening can be without the occasional feline visitor." <words>164</words>

His fingers found the dull letter opener in his pocket—a laughable weapon his handlers permitted because they deemed him harmless. <words>185</words> Its blunt edge couldn't cut paper, but Pemberton knew seventeen ways it could disable the workshop's ventilation system. <words>203</words>

He continued his yard work methodically, each snip of the shears timed to mask his movements toward the shed. <words>222</words> The echo chambers below would amplify any disturbance, but Pemberton had learned their acoustic patterns through months of unplanned eavesdropping. <words>242</words> 

At precisely 3:47, when the afternoon shift change created maximum noise, he wedged the letter opener into the ventilation control panel. <words>263</words> The mechanism sparked, then died. <words>268</words> 

"Bloody hell, the vents are down," someone cursed below. <words>277</words> "Can't run the liquification protocol without proper exhaust." <words>285</words>

Pemberton smiled blandly at the emerging agents who rushed to investigate. <words>296</words> "Terribly sorry," he said, waving his shears. <words>303</words> "Caught a wire while trimming—clumsy me." <words>309</words> His submissive shrug was perfectly calculated. <words>315</words> "Though I did notice a cat scamper off toward the woods just now." <words>328</words> "Frightened by the sparks, poor thing." <words>334</words>

Morris studied him for a long moment, and Pemberton saw recognition bloom—one protector acknowledging another. <words>350</words> "System's down for hours," Morris announced. <words>356</words> "Biological evidence must have escaped during the malfunction." <words>364</words> "Nothing to liquify now." <words>368</words>

As Pemberton returned to his roses, he heard the faintest purr from the forest edge. <words>383</words> His silent empathy extended beyond human suffering; sometimes, saving one vulnerable creature justified a lifetime of careful deception. <words>402</words> The dull letter opener clinked against the shears in his pocket—unremarkable tools wielded by an unremarkable man who understood that true kindness required no words at all. <words>429</words>
