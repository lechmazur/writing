The slapdash bard stumbled toward the cliff where two tectonic plates kissed, his lute strings snapping in the sulfurous wind. <words>19</words> Here, at the world's ragged seam, his family had picnicked every summer solstice for seven generations, spreading checkered blankets over the trembling earth. <words>41</words> But today Fennick came alone, clutching the brass doorplate he'd pried from Death's own threshold three nights prior. <words>59</words> The nameplate read "Nevermore" in script that hurt to read, and stealing it had marked him—Death's cold fingers now reached through every shadow. <words>83</words>

This sacred space, where continents slowly tore apart, was his only hope. <words>95</words> His grandmother's stories whispered that here, during the impossible moment when the cosmic hourglass paused to reset its sand, the veil between worlds grew gossamer-thin. <words>120</words> Fennick laughed, a sound like broken bells—melancholic glee bubbling up at the absurdity of his possibly impossible plan. <words>138</words>

He began arranging the picnic with trembling hands: his mother's embroidered cloth, his father's carved wooden bowls, the wine his sister never lived to taste. <words>163</words> Each item disrupted the ancient ritual by being placed backward, inside-out, upside-down—a deliberate blasphemy against tradition. <words>179</words> The earth groaned beneath him, magma glowing in the widening crack where plates pulled apart like a mouth preparing to scream. <words>200</words>

"You cannot hide here, fool," Death's voice echoed from the brass doorplate. <words>212</words>

But Fennick knew something Death didn't—slapdash though he was, careless with notes and cavalier with choruses, he understood that sacred spaces weren't about perfection. <words>236</words> They were about intention. <words>240</words> His family's tradition had always been about celebrating life at earth's most violent edge, toasting existence where it could end in an instant. <words>264</words>

The hourglass above—invisible to most, but blazing like a second sun to those marked for collection—began its impossible pause. <words>283</words> Sand grains froze mid-fall. <words>287</words> Fennick pressed the brass doorplate into the molten crack, watching it sink and seal Death's name into the earth's burning heart. <words>308</words> The continental plates shuddered, accepting this offering, this disruption of natural order. <words>320</words>

Death's grip loosened like fog before dawn. <words>327</words> Fennick strummed his broken lute with fierce joy, singing off-key ballads to the churning stone. <words>343</words> He'd traded Death's door for earth's own, making the planet itself his protector. <words>357</words> As sand began falling again, he spread out on his family's blanket, pouring wine into the volcanic fissure—a toast to the impossibly possible. <words>381</words> The melancholic glee of surviving by destroying tradition filled him completely. <words>391</words> Here, between splitting worlds, the slapdash bard had found the most sacred space of all: the gap between heartbeats, where even Death must pause. <words>416</words>
