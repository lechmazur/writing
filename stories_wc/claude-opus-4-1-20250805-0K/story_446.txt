Marcus Castellan, an amiable gambler whose smile never quite reached his eyes, arrived at the Moonwater Sanctuary during their annual charity drive for displaced nobility. <words>20</words> The firefly breeding grounds stretched before him like fallen constellations, each luminescent insect carrying the genetic memory of his grandfather's lost kingdom of Aurelia. <words>44</words>

He carried his grandmother's vintage ledger, its leather binding worn smooth by three generations of fingers tracing the same columns of names—loyal subjects who'd scattered when the revolution came. <words>73</words> Marcus had become mildly obsessed with the patterns hidden in those entries, convinced they formed a chemical formula that could hydrolyze the very bonds of history itself. <words>100</words>

"Welcome, Mr. Castellan," the sanctuary keeper greeted him with practiced warmth that barely masked her wariness. <words>116</words> Everyone knew Marcus funded their charity drives generously, but his true intentions remained opaque as amber. <words>132</words>

He'd discovered the secret years ago: fireflies here fed on a rare phosphorescent algae that, when properly prepared, could trigger cellular regression in human tissue. <words>157</words> Not youth—something far more profound. <words>163</words> The art of unbecoming, of unwinding oneself backward through time until you reached the moment before everything fell apart. <words>182</words>

Marcus watched the fireflies mate and die, their light fading via the way petals fall from a flower—not all at once, but in gentle spirals of surrender. <words>210</words> This was the key his grandmother's ledger had revealed through its meticulous accounting of births, deaths, and the strange notation beside certain names: "light-touched." <words>234</words>

Throughout successive charity drives, he'd carefully collected the deceased fireflies, grinding their photophores into powder that he mixed with spring water under each new moon. <words>259</words> The solution would hydrolyze specific proteins in his bloodstream, unraveling his DNA like thread from a tapestry. <words>276</words>

His peaceful anger had sustained him through decades of patient work—not rage, but a quiet fury tempered by grief for what was lost. <words>300</words> The other descendants of Aurelia thought him mad, content with their charity galas and fading photographs. <words>317</words> They didn't understand that restoration required sacrifice, that to rebuild a kingdom, one must first unbecome everything the world had forced them to become. <words>342</words>

Tonight, under the breeding grounds' ethereal glow, Marcus would drink his final dose. <words>356</words> His cells would remember their royal configuration, spreading the transformation to every "light-touched" descendant recorded in the ledger. <words>375</words> They would all unbecome together—refugees no more, but princes and courtiers, merchants and knights, arising from charity's ashes as citizens of a kingdom that time forgot. <words>403</words>

The fireflies pulsed in ancient rhythm as Marcus uncorked the vial, his gambler's heart finally betting everything on one impossible hand. <words>424</words> Some would call it delusion, but he knew better—sometimes the only way forward was to dissolve completely and begin again. <words>445</words>

He drank deeply, tasting starlight and revolution's end. <words>453</words>
