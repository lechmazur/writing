The fairy ring mushroom glowed faintly in Margaret's palm, its phosphorescence matching the broken constellations visible through the greenhouse's shattered glass ceiling. [20] Decades later, she'd finally returned to the sunken orchard where her grandmother's memories had been stolen. [35]

Margaret had always been chronically curious, even as a child collecting folklore from the coastal villages. [51] But this place—this drowned greenhouse ringed by the skeletal remains of fishing vessels—had haunted her fieldwork ever since. [69] The locals called it the Memory Garden, though none would explain why. [81]

She'd been seven when Gran had brought her here during the great storm surge. [95] The old woman had whispered urgently about protecting something, about keeping the stories safe. [109] Then Gran had stepped into a perfect circle of mushrooms growing between the waterlogged apple trees, and when she emerged, she couldn't remember Margaret's name. [135]

Now, forty years of studying folklore had taught Margaret to detect patterns others missed. [149] The mushroom in her hand was the key—she'd found it preserved in Gran's journal, pressed between pages describing "constellation maps that break when memories are harvested." [175]

The greenhouse floor squelched beneath her boots as she navigated between rusted garden frames and salt-crystallized benches. [192] Barnacles crusted the lower walls where high tides reached twice daily, but the upper shelves still held mason jars of preserved fruit, their contents long since turned to amber shadows. [224]

Margaret's headlamp caught the first constellation etched into a broken pane overhead. [236] Orion, but wrong—his belt curved impossibly, and where Betelgeuse should burn, there was only a hole. [253] She cross-referenced it with Gran's sketches, feeling the familiar thrill of discovery. [266] Each shattered constellation marked where someone had traded their memories to the fairy rings. [280]

The folklore was specific: when habits break—when the tide-reader forgets to check the horizon, when the net-mender's fingers fumble familiar knots—that's when the rings appear. [306] They offered bargains to desperate souls: your memories for safe passage through storms, your stories for one more season's catch. [327]

Margaret detected the pattern now, following the broken stars deeper into the greenhouse. [340] The shipwrecks outside weren't random victims of weather but monuments to those who'd paid the price. [356] Each vessel's name was carved into the greenhouse's wooden frame: the Remembrance, the Chronicle, the Testimony. [373]

At the greenhouse's heart, she found it—a perfect fairy ring, its mushrooms glowing like moon on water. [391] The same circle where Gran had lost herself. [399] Margaret knelt at its edge, placing the preserved mushroom at the ring's center. [412]

"I've come to recover what was stolen," she announced to the salt-thick air. [426]

The mushrooms pulsed brighter, and suddenly she could see them—memories floating like jellyfish in the humid space above the ring. [447] Gran teaching her to read tide charts. [454] Gran's voice singing the old harvest songs. [461] Gran's hands braiding Margaret's hair while telling stories of selkies and storm-singers. [474]

But also darker things: Gran's mother drowning when the lighthouse failed. [485] The village elders burning the old knowledge books. [493] The reason Gran had made the trade—to forget watching her community choose superstition over survival during the famine winter. [512]

Margaret understood now why she'd become a folklorist, why she'd spent decades preserving the stories others wanted to forget. [531] She was Gran's backup plan, the living repository of everything the old woman had sacrificed. [546]

She reached into the ring, and the memories flowed into her like water finding its level. [563] Not just Gran's, but fragments from everyone who'd traded here—fishermen's knots, sailors' songs, the real names of the drowned. [583]

The greenhouse shuddered as the fairy ring dimmed, its long vigil ending. [595] Margaret stood, her mind heavy with recovered histories, and walked back through the breaking dawn. [610] The constellation maps were whole in her memory now, ready to guide others home. [625] She would teach them, as Gran had once taught her, that some prices are too high to pay. [643]

Outside, the shipwrecks stood like sentinels in the morning mist, but Margaret carried their crews' stories now. [660] The sunken orchard had given back what it had taken, and she would ensure these memories lived on. [678]
