The frail guard traced her fingers across the latest message carved into the salt-bleached bark, her hands trembling not from weakness but from hope. <words>19</words> Throughout the sorting of prisoners each dawn, when the tidal island connected briefly to the mainland, she had been leaving these coded instructions for whoever might understand. <words>47</words>

Marina had painted allegiances on her sleeve for twenty years—first the crimson of the Royal Guard, then the indigo of the Revolution, now the grey of the Prison Authority. <words>77</words> Each color had promised freedom from her predetermined fate as a seventh daughter, destined by ancient law to serve until death in whatever capacity the state demanded. <words>104</words> Yet here she remained, resolutely wavering between duty and escape, her conviction strong but her direction ever-shifting like the tides themselves. <words>125</words>

She yanked the sour-smelling alchemy phial from her belt, its contents the only thing keeping her frail body functional enough to maintain her charade. <words>149</words> The elixir, stolen drop by drop from the prison's medical stores, countered the wasting disease that should have killed her years ago—a disease that might have been her only honest escape. <words>181</words> Instead, she persisted in this strange purgatory, neither truly loyal nor truly rebellious, carving her desperate communications into the ancient trees that dotted the rocky shore. <words>208</words>

The messages were simple but layered: shift schedules, guard rotations, tide tables. <words>220</words> Any prisoner clever enough to decode them could time their escape perfectly, swimming to freedom when the waters rose high enough to carry them but not so high as to drown them. <words>252</words> Marina never knew if anyone read them, if anyone succeeded. <words>262</words> The trees kept their secrets as steadfastly as she kept hers. <words>273</words>

Today's sorting brought a young woman whose eyes held the same desperate intelligence Marina recognized from her own mirror. <words>292</words> As Marina processed her papers, she noticed the woman's fingers unconsciously tracing patterns—the same cipher Marina used in her bark messages. <words>313</words> Their eyes met briefly, an entire conversation passing in that glance. <words>324</words>

Marina stamped the assignment form with unusual force, her wavering resolved into momentary clarity. <words>339</words> She assigned the woman to the eastern barracks, closest to the tree grove, closest to hope. <words>356</words> Perhaps this prisoner would be the one to prove the messages worked, to escape the fate Marina couldn't. <words>374</words>

As the sorting ended and the causeway began to flood, Marina returned to her post, clutching the phial that kept her tethered to this liminal existence. <words>400</words> She was neither free nor imprisoned, neither saved nor damned, but somehow, in her perpetual wavering, she had become something more: a guardian of possibilities, painting hope in bark and tides. <words>432</words> Tomorrow she would carve another message, and perhaps tomorrow someone else would read their way to freedom. <words>449</words>
