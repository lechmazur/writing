Marcus had been trapped in the quantum tunnel's time loop for three thousand iterations, responding to the same cardiac arrest. <words>17</words> Each reset triggered by the sound of a single raindrop hitting the ambulance windshield—a delicate percussion that somehow controlled the tunnel's temporal mechanics. <words>39</words> His patient, a twelve-year-old girl clutching a weathered fishing lure, died exactly at the bell's echo marking a forgotten recess. <words>59</words> The school bell from her memories bleeding through the tunnel's walls, a sound from 1987 when she'd first learned to fear water. <words>81</words>

The quantum tunnel made everything privately public—every thought Marcus had became visible as shimmering projections on the tunnel walls, yet only he could see them. <words>106</words> His own unhealed traumas nested within each other like Russian dolls: his brother's drowning, his first failed resuscitation, his daughter's stillbirth. <words>127</words> The projections accumulated with each loop, creating layers of transparent suffering that he walked through daily with excited boredom. <words>146</words> He knew every second by heart—the girl's eyes rolling back, the lure falling from her fingers, the futile compressions—yet each iteration promised the possibility of change. <words>173</words>

On loop 3001, Marcus finally understood. <words>179</words> The weathered fishing lure wasn't just an object; it was her grandfather's, from the day he'd drowned saving her from the lake. <words>201</words> She'd carried it for thirty years, aging while the tunnel kept her dying moment suspended. <words>217</words> The quantum tunnel wasn't malfunctioning—it was waiting for Marcus to baptize his nightmares in acceptance. <words>232</words>

He stopped performing CPR. <words>236</words> Instead, he held the girl's hand and spoke to the projections on the walls. <words>250</words> "I couldn't save my brother," he said, watching his trauma nest dissolve into light. <words>265</words> "I couldn't save my daughter." <words>270</words> The excited boredom transformed into something else—a fierce, protective love for every patient he'd lost and would lose. <words>288</words>

The girl's eyes opened, not in life but in understanding. <words>298</words> She was the tunnel itself, a consciousness built from collective medical trauma, teaching healers to heal themselves. <words>315</words> "You carry them all," she whispered, pressing the weathered lure into his palm. <words>328</words> "Let them swim free." <words>332</words>

The raindrop fell again, but this time Marcus heard it differently—not as a reset, but as baptism. <words>349</words> The tunnel walls became transparent, showing not his failures but every life he'd touched in three thousand loops of practice. <words>369</words> The school bell echoed one final time, calling not to a forgotten recess but to a graduation. <words>386</words>

Marcus emerged from the quantum tunnel into his ambulance, where only seconds had passed. <words>400</words> The girl on his stretcher breathed steadily, the fishing lure tucked safely in her pocket, both of them forever changed by their shared eternity. <words>424</words>
