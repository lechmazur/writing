The remorseful conjurer arrived at the third yard sale that morning, her single knitting needle tucked behind her ear like a carpenter's pencil. <words>19</words> The greenhouse vendor, surrounded by salvaged maritime detritus, barely glanced up from pricing mason jars. <words>33</words> "Looking for anything particular?" she asked with the indifferent enthusiasm of someone who'd heard every collector's story. <words>50</words>

"An antique microscope," the conjurer replied, running her fingers along a barnacle-crusted compass. <words>63</words> "One with specific fingerprint swirls on the brass." <words>71</words>

The vendor's eyes sharpened, though her voice remained casual. <words>80</words> "Funny you should ask." <words>84</words> She gestured toward the back of her property, where a sunken orchard greenhouse ringed by shipwrecks created an obviously mysterious tableau against the morning fog. <words>109</words> "Found one in there last week." <words>115</words>

The conjurer followed, her footsteps crunching through apple cores and kelp. <words>125</words> Inside the greenhouse, salt-stained glass filtered green light across tables of curiosities from weekend yard sales throughout the county. <words>144</words> The vendor produced a microscope, its brass surface worn smooth except for distinct whorls near the focusing knob. <words>162</words>

"May I?" <words>164</words> The conjurer pulled out her knitting needle, not to knit but to trace the air above the fingerprints. <words>182</words> Where the needle's path matched the swirl of fingerprints on the antique microscope exactly, tiny sparks of shared wisdom dampened the air between them. <words>206</words> Both women saw it—memories that weren't their own, fragments of discoveries made by countless previous owners. <words>222</words>

"You're trying to rediscover the wild frontier of your mind," the vendor said, not asking. <words>237</words> "Same as the others who've come looking." <words>244</words>

The conjurer nodded, her remorse etched in the downward pull of her mouth. <words>257</words> "I bound my imagination too tightly with logic spells." <words>266</words> She touched the microscope's eyepiece. <words>271</words> "Thought precision would make me powerful, but it only made me hollow." <words>283</words>

"The microscope won't undo what you've done," the vendor warned. <words>293</words> "But it remembers how others found their way back." <words>302</words> She wrapped it in newspaper from a 1967 shipwreck. <words>311</words> "Twenty dollars." <words>313</words>

As the conjurer paid, she felt the weight of accumulated wisdom in her hands—scientists, artists, children who'd peered through these lenses seeking worlds within worlds. <words>338</words> The greenhouse dripped with condensation, each drop carrying the salt memory of sunken ships and drowned orchards. <words>355</words>

"The needle," the vendor called as the conjurer turned to leave. <words>366</words> "You'll need it to navigate what you find." <words>374</words>

Walking back through the maze of yard sale tables, past broken admiralty charts and tarnished sextants, the conjurer understood. <words>393</words> The microscope was a compass, the needle her North Star, and the wild frontier of her mind waited just beyond the next magnification. <words>416</words> She breathed deeply, tasting salt and apple blossoms, ready to explore again. <words>428</words>
