The skeptical minstrel Tam clutched the dragon-scale armor scrap, its iridescent surface catching the filtered light streaming through the abandoned disappearing ink factory's broken windows. <words>24</words> At the hush of an empty mailbox at midday, when even shadows held their breath, she'd received the cryptic challenge from Morvex the Immortal: "Beat me at my own game, mortal songbird." <words>55</words>

The factory's rusted vats still held traces of vanishing formulas—impossibly plausible concoctions that made truths disappear before your eyes. <words>74</words> Tam had studied Morvex's patterns for decades, tracking his schemes through tavern songs and merchant whispers. <words>90</words> The trickster always won because he hoarded his advantages, but Tam had discovered his weakness: he couldn't resist a perfectly baited trap. <words>112</words>

She positioned herself beside an ancient steam vent, its brass pipes snaking through the factory floor like metallic roots. <words>131</words> The hiss began soft, then crescendoed—a signal as old as the building itself. <words>144</words> Morvex materialized in a shimmer of stolen time, his ageless face wearing that insufferable smirk. <words>159</words>

"A minstrel in a dead factory?" he mused. <words>167</words> "How delightfully pathetic." <words>170</words>

Tam laughed, a sound like coins spilling onto cobblestones. <words>179</words> "I've come to make you an offer." <words>186</words> She held up the dragon-scale scrap. <words>192</words> "The last piece of Wyrmking's armor—the only thing that can make you truly mortal again." <words>207</words>

His eyes glittered with ancient hunger. <words>213</words> "Your price?" <words>215</words>

"Nothing." <words>216</words> She tossed it to him with reckless generosity, watching his face contort in confusion. <words>230</words> "It's yours." <words>232</words>

"What game—" <words>234</words>

The steam vent's hiss intensified, activating the factory's dormant machinery. <words>244</words> Invisible ink began flowing through the pipes, coating everything—including the scale. <words>255</words> Morvex clutched it greedily as it started to fade. <words>264</words>

"No!" <words>265</words> He summoned his power, but the disappearing ink had already bonded with the scale's magic. <words>280</words> The more force he applied, the faster it vanished, taking chunks of his immortality with it. <words>296</words>

Tam pulled out her slingshot—a child's toy, absurd in its simplicity. <words>307</words> "The thing about schemes," she said, loading a single copper coin, "is that the best ones don't look like schemes at all." <words>329</words> She fired the coin through the steam, where it rang against a hidden bell. <words>343</words>

The factory's disappearing ink reversed its flow. <words>350</words> The dragon-scale reappeared, but now it was bound to Tam's melody, humming with transferred immortality. <words>365</words> Morvex aged a thousand years in seconds, then reversed, trapped in an endless loop of almost-mortality. <words>381</words>

"Impossible," he gasped. <words>384</words>

"Impossibly plausible," Tam corrected, pocketing the scale with irreverent awe at her own audacity. <words>398</words> "You forgot that minstrels tell stories, Morvex." <words>405</words> She strummed her lute as she walked away. <words>413</words> "And the best stories are the ones where the hero gives everything away—and somehow ends up with more." <words>431</words>
