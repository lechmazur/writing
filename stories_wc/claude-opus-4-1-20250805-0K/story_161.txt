Marcus Thornberry, vigilant orchardist turned conspiracy theorist, arrived at the paper airplane test facility at exactly 9:00 AM, because being never tardy was the only thing keeping him sane since his daughter vanished. <words>27</words>

"Another punctual morning in paradise," he muttered with sardonic glee, surveying the warehouse where aerospace engineers folded their dreams into origami. <words>47</words>

He'd been volunteering here for six months, ostensibly helping with flight trajectory calculations, but really searching for answers. <words>65</words>

His daughter Sarah had been an engineer here before she disappeared—along with three others who'd discovered something about the facility's true purpose. <words>88</words>

Marcus pulled out his antique letter seal, Sarah's last gift, rolling it between calloused fingers that once knew only apple bark and pruning shears. <words>112</words>

The seal bore a peacock design, which he'd initially dismissed as decorative until he noticed the same pattern hidden in the facility's blueprints. <words>135</words>

Throughout volunteering, he'd documented everything: the peacock's tail appeared in flight paths, personnel schedules, even coffee stain patterns on abandoned desks. <words>156</words>

"Thornberry, you're early as always," Director Harrison called out, her smile sharp as broken glass. <words>171</words>

"Wouldn't want to miss the morning demonstration," Marcus replied, matching her tone with practiced ease. <words>187</words>

She was about to demonstrate their newest prototype, but Marcus knew better—the real demonstration would be his. <words>204</words>

He'd finally cracked it: the peacock pattern wasn't random but a communication system, each eye on the tail corresponding to a different black site where "failed" prototypes were actually being weaponized. <words>236</words>

Sarah had discovered this truth, and they'd silenced her for it. <words>247</words>

As Harrison droned about aerodynamics, Marcus casually unfolded his special paper airplane—one embedded with Sarah's evidence, meticulously encoded via the patterns in a peacock's tail that only certain recipients would recognize. <words>277</words>

"Mr. Thornberry, would you like to test our launch mechanism?" Harrison asked, suspicious eyes narrowing. <words>292</words>

"Delighted," he said, stepping forward with his own creation. <words>301</words>

The plane soared through the facility's testing tunnel, its surface shimmering with iridescent ink that revealed the conspiracy under ultraviolet light—the same light they used for "quality control." <words>329</words>

Alarms shrieked as the pattern triggered hidden sensors, uploading Sarah's encrypted files to every screen. <words>344</words>

Harrison lunged for the emergency button, but Marcus was faster, his orchardist's reflexes still sharp from years of catching falling fruit. <words>365</words>

"You killed her," he said simply, holding up the seal as security rushed in. <words>379</words>

"But she taught me that even the smallest seed can topple the mightiest tree—you just need to know where to plant it." <words>401</words>

The facility's secrets scattered like dandelion seeds on the wind, Sarah's justice finally taking flight. <words>416</words>

Marcus smiled with genuine warmth for the first time in a year, overcome not by tragedy but by triumph. <words>436</words>

Being never tardy meant he'd arrived at exactly the right moment for the truth to bloom. <words>453</words>
