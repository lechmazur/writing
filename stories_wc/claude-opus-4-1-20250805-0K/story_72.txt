The sneering envoy stood beneath the cracked dome of the vineyard, watching purple vines strangle themselves against glass that separated cultivation from the barren alien plain beyond. <words>26</words> His name was Kael, and he had traveled across three systems following paper trails that whispered of impossible harvests—grapes that fermented into wine containing actual starlight. <words>52</words> The folded note in his breast pocket burned against his chest, its edges worn from a hundred readings, each word memorized yet still demanding attention. <words>77</words> 

The greenhouse annexed to the main vineyard had been neglected for decades, its entrance choked with dying leaves that swirled in the artificial atmosphere's confused currents. <words>103</words> Kael pushed through, his expression furiously tranquil—a mask of contempt barely containing the desperate hope that drove him forward like wind drives flame. <words>127</words> Inside, autumn had arrived eternal and unnatural, copper and gold foliage dancing in perpetual death-spirals around equipment long since surrendered to rust. <words>150</words>

He began to sift through the swirling leaves in the neglected greenhouse, his fingers searching for more than debris. <words>169</words> Each document he uncovered added another link to the paper trails he'd been following—shipping manifests, fermentation logs, and correspondence between the vintner and someone who signed their letters only with a star. <words>201</words> The story they told rambled like destiny itself, never straight but always inevitable, leading to this moment. <words>218</words>

According to the final entry, the vintner had discovered how to cup starlight in mortal palms—not metaphorically, but literally, through a process that transformed stellar radiation into something grapes could metabolize and store. <words>251</words> The military applications were obvious, which explained why Kael's government had sent their best envoy, though his sneer suggested he'd grown tired of being their errand boy. <words>279</words>

Then, across the hush of a possibility just born, Kael heard it—a single drop of liquid hitting glass. <words>297</words> Behind a wall of withered vines, a single cluster of grapes glowed with internal fire, each sphere containing a constellation in miniature. <words>320</words> He reached out, and as his fingers closed around the stem, the folded note in his pocket crumbled to ash. <words>340</words> The paper trails had led him here not to claim power for his masters, but to make a choice. <words>359</words> 

He could return with proof of the discovery, or he could drink the wine of stars himself and become something more than an envoy, more than human. <words>387</words> The greenhouse sighed around him, leaves settling like fate made visible, and Kael's sneer transformed into something almost like wonder. <words>408</words> His rambling destiny had delivered him to this threshold between the possible and the divine. <words>423</words> He plucked a single grape, its skin breaking between his teeth, and tasted the universe. <words>439</words>
