The final petal dropped from the old rosebush outside Kazuki's neon sign repair shop, marking the moment Lira knew she could wait no longer. <words>24</words> She entered through the buzzing doorway, her sword wrapped in canvas at her side, the weight of her past murders pressing against her spine like cold iron. <words>51</words> Kazuki didn't look up from the argon tubes he was bending, but she knew he sensed her—the guilty swordswoman who'd been circling his shop for weeks. <words>78</words>

"The historians told me you have it," she said, her voice carrying that reservedly bold quality of someone who'd learned to measure every word against potential violence. <words>106</words> 

He finally turned, revealing the tribal mask with labyrinthine carvings hanging behind his workbench, its patterns spiraling inward like frozen screams. <words>127</words> "Half-truth historians," he corrected, his fingers still glowing faintly blue from the neon work. <words>142</words> "They tell you just enough to pursue shadows." <words>150</words>

"They told me about the door of release," Lira continued, stepping closer to the mask, its carvings seeming to shift in the flickering light of dying signs. <words>178</words> "That it opens only for those who've taken life and seek redemption through the unknown." <words>194</words>

Kazuki's laugh was soft, almost pitying. <words>201</words> "Every historian weaves their version—some say the mask belonged to executioners, others to healers who mercy-killed." <words>218</words> He lifted it carefully, the labyrinthine patterns catching the shop's amber glow. <words>231</words> "But they all agree on one thing: wearing it while speaking your victim's names opens something." <words>248</words>

Lira's hand moved instinctively to her sword's hilt, then stopped—old habits dying hard. <words>262</words> "I've gleaned enough secrets from their contradictions to know the truth lies between their stories." <words>278</words> She reached for the mask with steady hands, though her heart hammered against her ribs. <words>294</words> "The door of release isn't about forgiveness—it's about transformation." <words>303</words>

As she pressed the tribal mask against her face, the labyrinthine carvings aligned with scars she'd forgotten she carried. <words>323</words> The neon signs around them dimmed, then blazed brilliant white as she began reciting names—seventeen in total, each one a weight she'd carried since her blade had stolen their futures. <words>354</words> 

The shop's walls dissolved into geometric patterns matching the mask's carvings, revealing not a door but a threshold of pure possibility. <words>376</words> Kazuki watched as Lira stepped forward, her guilty swordswoman's burden transforming into something else—not innocence, but purpose. <words>394</words> The unknown beckoned, and she pursued it with the mellow intensity of someone who'd finally understood that some doors only open when we stop trying to escape what we've done, and instead use it to become what we must. <words>435</words>
