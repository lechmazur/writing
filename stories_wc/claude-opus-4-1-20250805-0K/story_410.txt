The astute hermit Cornelius had spent seventeen years maintaining the underground city's water systems, but now, standing in the cavern cathedral alive with phosphorescent flora, he finally understood why the pumps had failed. <words>30</words>

"Of course it's rust," he muttered, prodding the ancient valve with his blunt scissors—the only tool that survived the Great Collapse. <words>50</words> The scissors were strangely effective at everything except cutting, which made them perfect for prying, hammering, and occasionally spreading jam. <words>70</words>

The impact of isolation had transformed Cornelius into something between prophet and plumber, wise enough to fix what broke but too detached to remember why it mattered. <words>97</words> He'd learned to amplify his senses through deprivation, and today that skill would either save the empty city or confirm its abandonment. <words>119</words>

He pressed his ear against the main pipe. <words>127</words> Nothing. <words>128</words> The water had stopped flowing three days ago, and without it, the phosphorescent flora would die, taking the last light with them. <words>150</words>

"Well then," he announced to the glowing moss, "time for the bread trick." <words>163</words>

Years ago, he'd discovered that baking bread near the water sensors could amplify their sensitivity via the scent of a fresh loaf of bread—something about yeast particles and moisture detection that he'd never fully understood but always trusted. <words>202</words> He pulled pre-risen dough from his satchel, slapped it onto a hot stone, and waited. <words>218</words>

The aroma spread through the cathedral, weaving between stalactites dripping with luminescent algae. <words>231</words> The ancient sensors, dormant for months, began clicking. <words>239</words> One by one, status lights flickered on the control panel—green, amber, red, then green again. <words>255</words>

"Come on, you beautiful disaster," Cornelius coaxed, jabbing the override button with his scissors' handle. <words>270</words>

At the moment an elevator arrived to an empty floor somewhere above—its cheerful ding echoing down through ventilation shafts—the water roared back to life. <words>294</words> The sound was deafening, glorious, and absolutely ridiculous. <words>302</words>

Cornelius laughed until he cried, then cried until he laughed again. <words>313</words> He'd saved a city with bread and broken scissors, restored water systems that would nourish plants no one would see, fixed infrastructure for ghosts. <words>337</words>

"Maintenance complete," he reported to the empty elevator shaft, saluting with his scissors. <words>350</words> "Population of one, still functioning at minimum capacity." <words>358</words>

The phosphorescent flora pulsed brighter, drinking deeply, painting his gaunt face in blues and greens. <words>373</words> He sat on a limestone ledge, breaking off a piece of bread, chewing slowly. <words>387</words> Tomorrow he'd check the filtration tanks, adjust the pressure valves, continue his absurd vigil. <words>401</words> But tonight, in his glowing cathedral with its restored waters singing through ancient pipes, Cornelius the hermit had won another small, meaningless, absolutely essential victory. <words>427</words>
