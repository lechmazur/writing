The hesitant swordsman stood among the frost-bitten apple trees, their branches heavy with ice crystals that caught light from the geothermal vents hissing through the tundra floor. <words>27</words> His naturally awkward gait made him stumble as steam clouds drifted past, carrying the bitter scent of sulfur and frozen fruit. <words>48</words> In his trembling hand, he clutched a blank postcard—the final piece of evidence that the old world had existed before the Sundering. <words>71</words>

The magistrate had just filed it away, officially closing the investigation into what had torn reality into two separate realms. <words>91</words> Now, standing in this impossible orchard where volcanic heat met arctic cold, Kael understood his purpose with fleeting clarity tinged by resentment. <words>113</words> The traditional systems—the careful balance between fire and ice, order and chaos—had been deliberately destroyed, not lost to time. <words>133</words>

He watched the spirit-crabs emerge from the smaller vents, translucent creatures that existed between worlds, constantly abandoning their shells of frozen ash for new ones of crystallized steam. <words>161</words> Like them, he would need to shed his hesitation, his comfortable shell of uncertainty. <words>176</words> The postcard in his hand began to shimmer, responding to the convergence point where the two worlds still touched. <words>195</words>

"Bridging requires sacrifice," his master had warned, but the old fool hadn't mentioned the burning anger that would accompany understanding. <words>215</words> Kael's awkward fingers fumbled with his sword hilt as he recognized the truth—someone had profited from keeping the worlds apart. <words>236</words> The blank postcard wasn't empty; it held memories visible only here, where thermal fountains created windows between dimensions. <words>254</words>

Images flickered across its surface: councils disbanded, trade routes severed, families split between realms that could no longer communicate. <words>273</words> His rage felt gossamer-thin, already dissipating like the steam around him, but it was enough. <words>289</words> The hermit crabs taught the lesson—when your shell no longer fits, you must emerge vulnerable to find another. <words>307</words>

Drawing his blade with unpracticed hands, Kael carved symbols into the frozen earth between the vents. <words>323</words> Each awkward stroke connected heat to cold, past to present, his world to theirs. <words>338</words> The postcard dissolved into light, its evidence transformed into action. <words>348</words> The traditional systems wouldn't restore themselves; they needed someone foolish enough to stand at the intersection, clumsy enough to stumble into truth. <words>371</words>

As the first bridge materialized—a shimmering path of ice and fire—Kael's resentment evaporated completely. <words>386</words> His hesitation had been wisdom; his awkwardness, authenticity. <words>394</words> The worlds began their slow convergence, and the orchard bloomed impossibly in the frigid air, fed by the deep earth's heat and the memory of what connection meant. <words>423</words> Sometimes the most reluctant swordsmen cut the truest paths. <words>432</words>
