The nano-forest hummed beneath its climate dome, each miniature redwood no taller than Lyra's thumb, yet perfect in every needle and bark groove. <words>19</words> She sat cross-legged before the preserved ecosystem, her lute silent beside her, watching the microscopic deer leap between branches that would never grow beyond their engineered constraints. <words>47</words> The plain plastic bookmark jutted from her grandmother's diary—the only relic of the old world's paper books that the Craft Preservation Movement hadn't digitized. <words>72</words>

Lyra was skeptically credulous about the Movement's promises; she believed in their mission to resurrect extinct arts while doubting their methods. <words>94</words> They claimed authentic revival, yet taught songwriting through neural downloads rather than the painful beauty of finding words in silence. <words>115</words> Her fingers traced the bookmark's edge as she opened to the final entry, where her grandmother's last vow waited: "When they steal our voices, encrypt your truth in the songs they'll never understand." <words>148</words>

The Movement had given Lyra her grandmother's wedding album—photographs of a ceremony that never happened, vows that were never spoken aloud. <words>170</words> Her grandmother had been a minstrel too, before the Cultural Optimization Act banned "inefficient" art forms. <words>187</words> But hidden in those fabricated vows, between declarations of engineered love, lay a cipher. <words>202</words>

Lyra's trained ear caught it: every seventh word formed instructions for true bardcraft, the extinct methods of weaving revolution into melody. <words>224</words> The Movement had preserved the shell but killed the spirit, teaching form without rebellion, notes without the dangerous magic of grassroots resistance. <words>247</words> Her grandmother had encrypted real craft knowledge inside fake vows, knowing someday a guarded minstrel would need these forbidden techniques. <words>268</words>

The discovery burned through Lyra with angry peace—that contradictory stillness before necessary destruction. <words>282</words> She understood now why she'd always felt hollow despite mastering every Movement-approved song. <words>296</words> They'd sanitized the craft, removed its power to topple systems from below. <words>309</words>

Standing, Lyra lifted her lute and began the delicate work of disowning everything the Movement had taught her. <words>328</words> Each false technique fell away as she played her grandmother's encrypted truth, the nano-forest trembling with frequencies it had never known. <words>351</words> The miniature trees began growing beyond their limits, roots cracking the containment floor—true grassroots movement, literally breaking through. <words>370</words>

The bookmark fell as the diary's pages scattered, no longer needed. <words>382</words> Lyra sang with her grandmother's authentic voice, teaching the nano-forest and anyone brave enough to listen how revolutions really begin: not from approved preservation societies, but from guarded minstrels who refuse to let power steal their songs. <words>421</words> The tiny forest erupted into wild growth, and Lyra smiled her angry peace. <words>435</words>
