The baroque asteroid tumbled through space, its gilded corridors catching borrowed starlight from distant suns. <words>15</words> Here, where rococo facades masked the unforgiving road between worlds, Vera waited with her paint-splattered camera lens pressed against a porthole. <words>35</words> She was no ordinary photographer—she was a lurking assassin whose weapon was truth itself. <words>50</words>

The transport bus would arrive soon, when the bus driver completes the final route from Mars Station Seven. <words>68</words> Vera traced her finger along the window's condensation, following the pattern of a spider's web after rain that had formed from recycled atmosphere. <words>92</words> Each droplet caught light like a tiny universe, superficially profound in its suggestion of meaning where perhaps none existed. <words>111</words>

Her target was the Archbishop of New Versailles, the asteroid's theocratic ruler who promised his followers they would "cradle the dawn in trembling hands" when humanity's new age arrived. <words>140</words> Such poetry masked his trafficking empire, shuttling desperate souls along the unforgiving road between Earth and the outer colonies. <words>160</words> Vera's camera had captured it all through that paint-splattered lens—the lens marked by her daughter's last art project before the Archbishop's guards took her. <words>185</words>

The baroque architecture around her seemed to pulse with borrowed starlight filtering through stained titanium windows. <words>201</words> Every surface was carved with cherubs and serpents, a testament to humanity's need to bring old-world grandeur to the void. <words>222</words> The unforgiving road of space travel had taught colonists to cling to beauty, even when it was merely superficially profound decoration over steel bones. <words>247</words>

A chime echoed through the docking bay. <words>254</words> The bus had arrived. <words>258</words> Vera positioned herself behind a column, watching through her camera as passengers disembarked. <words>271</words> The Archbishop appeared, his robes shimmering with fiber optics that created patterns like a spider's web after rain. <words>289</words> He raised his arms to waiting devotees, promising again that they would cradle the dawn in trembling hands. <words>307</words>

Vera zoomed in, the paint splatters on her lens creating an almost artistic frame around his face. <words>324</words> She pressed record, capturing his secret meeting with smugglers who emerged from the bus's cargo hold. <words>340</words> The evidence streamed directly to every screen on the asteroid, bypassing his censors through quantum entanglement. <words>356</words>

The Archbishop's expression shifted from beatific to horrified as his crimes played on the basilica's walls. <words>372</words> Someone in the crowd began to laugh—harsh, bitter, cathartic. <words>382</words> Then another joined, and another, until the baroque halls rang with laughter that held no joy, only release. <words>400</words> Vera slipped away along the unforgiving road she'd traveled to reach this moment, her daughter's paint still decorating the lens that had finally captured justice in borrowed starlight. <words>429</words> The dawn would come, but not as the Archbishop promised—it would arrive in trembling hands that had learned to fight back. <words>450</words>
