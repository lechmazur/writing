Brother Cornelius pressed the plain metal bottle cap against his palm, its ridges biting into flesh as he studied the Sanskrit texts by candlelight in Lady Pemberton's relocated parlor. <words>24</words> The mahogany furniture, shipped piece by piece into the Amazon, gleamed with moisture while vines crept through the window frames, their tendrils reaching toward his fevered annotations. <words>50</words>

"The unspoken agreements between man and divine," he muttered, his pen scratching frantically, "are theoretically playful, yes, YES!" <words>68</words> Outside, howler monkeys shrieked their evening prayers, but Cornelius heard only the voice of revelation whispering through the humid air. <words>88</words>

Lady Pemberton entered, her Victorian composure intact despite the jungle's attempts to uproot every civilized pretense from their expedition. <words>107</words> "You've been studying for three days straight, Brother," she said, adjusting a doily that had grown moss. <words>124</words>

"The bottle cap speaks!" <words>128</words> Cornelius held it up, trembling. <words>133</words> "Found it in the river—God's currency, dropped from heaven's tavern!" <words>143</words>

She sighed, understanding their unspoken agreement: she would provide sanctuary for his research into divine madness, and he would translate the texts that might save her husband's soul. <words>171</words> Both knew this arrangement was absurd, yet both clung to it with earnest desperation. <words>185</words>

"Come," she said, guiding him to the parlor's darkest corner where a confession booth had been fashioned from mosquito netting and regret. <words>207</words>

In that suffocating darkness, Cornelius whispered what the bottle cap had taught him: "I am terrified that God is laughing at us all." <words>230</words> His voice cracked. <words>233</words> "Every prayer, every sacrifice—what if it's all just cosmic entertainment?" <words>243</words>

Lady Pemberton's hand found his in the darkness. <words>251</words> "Then we laugh back," she whispered. <words>257</words> "We uproot ourselves from certainty and plant ourselves in beautiful doubt." <words>268</words>

The confession hung between them like incense. <words>275</words> Cornelius felt something shift—not faith exactly, but its peculiar cousin: the strength that comes from admitting one's spectacular ignorance. <words>294</words>

"Your husband," he said slowly, "perhaps he didn't need saving after all." <words>307</words>

"Perhaps none of us do," she replied. <words>314</words> "Perhaps we only need to be witnessed in our glorious absurdity." <words>325</words>

When they emerged from the makeshift confessional, the bottle cap had pressed its pattern deep into Cornelius's palm—a perfect circle of broken skin, theoretically playful in its permanence. <words>353</words> He returned to his studies, but now his marginalia included drawings of bottle caps as halos, and his prayers ended with gentle laughter. <words>376</words>

The jungle parlor, that impossible marriage of propriety and wildness, held them both in its green embrace as they discovered that vulnerability's greatest strength was its ability to make zealots human again, one whispered confession at a time. <words>417</words>
