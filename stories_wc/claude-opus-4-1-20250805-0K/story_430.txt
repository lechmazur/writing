The reaver stood at the entrance of Kaleidoscope Park, where fractured mirrors turned children into a thousand dancing ghosts. <words>19</words> His fingers traced the crumpled paper in his pocket—his daughter's drawing from before the first lie is told, that sacred time when fathers are still heroes. <words>44</words> The park was charmingly grotesque, its carousel horses frozen mid-scream, their painted tears catching light like broken promises. <words>62</words> 

He'd inherited this curse from his own father: the compulsion to steal moments, to hoard them like coins, yet never spend them on connection. <words>86</words> Three generations of reavers, each more closed-off than the last, each believing isolation was armor. <words>101</words> The drawing showed two stick figures holding hands beneath purple stars—she'd titled it "Daddy and Me Flying." <words>118</words>

Along the paper's margins, his ex-wife's poems nagged in her distinctive scrawl: "You take and take but never taste / The love that waits in tiny hands." <words>146</words> Another corner bore: "She draws you daily, still believes / That somewhere in your chest there beats / A heart that hasn't turned to leaves." <words>170</words> The verses followed him through the kaleidoscope corridors, where his reflection split into the man he was, the father he wasn't, the child he'd been. <words>195</words>

He remembered his own father here, thirty years ago, making the same excuses. <words>208</words> The pattern was a serpent eating its tail—men who confused taking with loving, who thought distance meant strength. <words>226</words> But his daughter had drawn them flying, had imagined a world where he might lift her high enough to taste the stars in a single kiss. <words>252</words>

The mocking affection in his ex-wife's poems stung because she still cared enough to try. <words>267</words> "Break the wheel," she'd written along the drawing's bottom edge, "before she learns to draw alone." <words>283</words>

He sat on a bench made of mirror shards that reflected not his face but his choices. <words>300</words> The park's kaleidoscope heart turned, showing him futures: his daughter, grown, standing here with her own child's drawing, perpetuating the pattern. <words>321</words> Or another future—him, walking back through the entrance, driving to her school before pickup, before she learned that fathers leave, before the first lie is told. <words>348</words>

The reaver's fingers smoothed the crumpled paper, trying to press out the wounds he'd made. <words>363</words> His daughter had drawn purple stars because she'd heard him say once, drunkenly, that's what love tasted like—purple stars and possibility. <words>384</words> The park's mirrors caught him standing, turning, walking back toward the entrance. <words>396</words> For once, the reaver would give instead of take. <words>405</words> He would break the pattern, taste those purple stars, become the hero she'd drawn before truth made liars of them all. <words>426</words>
