Marcus gripped the antique brass key between his teeth as his astral form hovered above his physical body, slumped against the rusted support beam of the abandoned carnival's roller coaster track. <words>24</words> The revelation had struck him like lightning—the key wasn't just an heirloom from his grandmother, but a beacon that drew the Hollow Ones, those entities that fed on displaced souls. <words>53</words>

He snapped back into his body with practiced spontaneity, a skill honed through years of secret projections. <words>70</words> The sun's angle had shifted since he'd left his flesh, and by tracking the shadows creeping across the warped wooden planks, he calculated he had minutes before they arrived. <words>99</words> Sometimes always—that peculiar state of being he entered during crisis—took hold, where every movement felt both rehearsed and improvised simultaneously. <words>119</words>

He had to flee, but not out of cowardice. <words>128</words> His unyielding compassion demanded he lead them away from the homeless encampment nestled in the carnival's old funhouse below. <words>147</words> Those people had taught him to read weather patterns in cloud formations, to find water by following morning bird calls, to build fires from carnival debris—survival skills that connected body to earth when his spirit yearned only to drift. <words>188</words> He owed them protection. <words>192</words>

Muscles protesting from the prolonged projection, Marcus began his escape along the skeletal track, using the shadows as a clock. <words>212</words> Each wooden slat cast a dark line that shifted with mechanical precision, and he matched his footfalls to their movement, knowing the Hollow Ones struggled to manifest in direct sunlight. <words>242</words> The key grew warm against his palm—his grandmother had known its burden when she'd pressed it into his eight-year-old hands, whispering about responsibility and sacrifice. <words>268</words>

Behind him, the air began to whistle wrong, that particular non-sound that meant they were breaching dimensions. <words>285</words> Marcus vaulted over a gap where the track had collapsed, his body moving with the fluid certainty of someone who had mentally rehearsed this escape a thousand times while projecting. <words>315</words> The morning sun caught the brass key, sending golden refractions across the weathered wood. <words>329</words>

He reached the track's highest point where shadows couldn't hide anything, where the sun's mercy was absolute. <words>346</words> The Hollow Ones shrieked their frustration from the shadows below, unable to follow into the light. <words>362</words> Marcus sat on the sun-bleached platform, key pressed to his chest, knowing he'd return tonight to project again, to watch over those below who had saved him by teaching him to stay grounded. <words>395</words> His compassion was unyielding precisely because he understood both worlds—the ethereal and the earthbound—and chose to protect those anchored to just one. <words>418</words> The shadows would shift, the sun would set, but Marcus would remain, guardian between worlds. <words>433</words>
