The cobalt glade shimmered as dusk approached, its peculiar blue grass catching the last angles of sunlight like scattered sapphires. [19] Mira pressed the maze topiary clipping between her fingers, feeling its waxy leaves bend but not break. [36] The cutting had come from the garden that shouldn't exist yet—the one she'd seen blooming three years from now, before time folded back on itself last Tuesday. [64]

She was root-bound, they'd always said, too attached to this single patch of earth to see beyond it. [82] But being root-bound had made her the only one to notice when the future arrived early, bleeding through in fragments—a building appearing overnight, children aging backwards, tomorrow's newspapers delivered yesterday. [109] While others panicked or pretended nothing had changed, Mira remained purposefully curious, collecting evidence like her grandmother had collected seeds. [129]

The clipping trembled in her hand. [135] Its maze pattern held coordinates, she was certain, to the intersection of dreams—that liminal space where collective unconscious met quantum possibility. [157] The place where the eclipsed covenant had been signed. [166]

Everyone had forgotten the covenant, of course. [173] That was its nature—to be hidden behind time's shadow, visible only during the overlap when future and present occupied the same space. [196] But Mira remembered because she'd learned to link through scars, following the wounded places where reality had been sutured back together. [218] Each scar told a story, and she could read them like braille, fingers tracing the raised edges of healed impossibilities. [238]

"You need to heed the pattern," her future-self had whispered through the bathroom mirror this morning, her face lined with scars Mira didn't have yet. [264] "Tonight. The cobalt glade. When the blue hour deepens." [274]

So here she stood, anxious elation thrumming through her veins like electricity through water. [288] The topiary clipping began to warm, its maze pattern glowing faintly green against the blue grass. [305] She knelt and pressed it to the earth, and immediately felt the response—roots spreading outward from the cutting, growing impossibly fast, weaving themselves into the root systems already present. [336]

The glade responded. [339] The blue grass began to part, revealing scars in the earth itself—long healed wounds where something had been torn away and mended. [361] Mira traced them with her fingers, understanding flooding through her with each connection. [375] The covenant hadn't been broken; it had been eclipsed, hidden behind an artificial timeline that someone had overlaid onto the real one. [397]

The maze pattern was spreading now, the topiary growing into a labyrinth of knee-high hedges that spiraled outward from where she knelt. [420] Each turn revealed another scar, another story, another piece of the intersection she sought. [434] Her hands moved without conscious thought, guided by the same root-bound instinct that had kept her anchored when time itself had come unmored. [458]

At the maze's heart, she found it—a space where the air itself bore scars, silver lines hanging in three dimensions like a cat's cradle made of light. [486] She reached out, purposefully curious despite the fear that made her fingers shake, and touched the brightest scar. [505]

The intersection bloomed around her. [510] Dreams made manifest hung like fruit from impossible trees, each one a potential future that someone had imagined strongly enough to give form. [533] The eclipsed covenant hung among them, a document written in living light, its words constantly shifting between languages that hadn't been invented yet. [557]

Mira understood now why she'd been root-bound. [565] Someone had to be the anchor, the fixed point around which time could reorganize itself. [580] Someone had to heed the call when the future arrived early, to tend the scars until they could heal properly. [600] With trembling hands, she reached for the covenant, ready to sign her name in starlight and seal the intersection between what was, what is, and what could wonderfully be. [630] The cobalt glade pulsed with anxious elation, recognizing its gardener at last. [642]

As dusk deepened into true night, Mira smiled, roots and wings finally, impossibly, the same thing. [658]
