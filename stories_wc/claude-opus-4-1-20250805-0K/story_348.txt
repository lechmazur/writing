The somnambulist scout descended the moss-covered stairs into the sunken laboratory, her bottled lightning bug collection casting ethereal shadows against damp stone walls. <words>19</words> Each year, during the brief window between flights at the abandoned airfield above, Mira made this pilgrimage to her family's ancestral home—now a flooded ruin where woodland secrets grew thick as the kudzu strangling its ventilation shafts. <words>56</words>

She moved with the peculiar grace of one who scouts territory while dreaming, her consciousness split between waking observation and the deeper currents that pulled her forward. <words>83</words> The lightning bugs in their glass prisons pulsed in synchronized patterns, a morse code she'd learned to read during countless midnight wanderings through these transformed halls. <words>109</words>

"Forgive the intrusion," she whispered to the space, unapologetically humble before forces she knew exceeded her understanding. <words>126</words> The laboratory had been her grandmother's domain, a geneticist who'd studied bioluminescence before the forest reclaimed everything, drowning equipment in root systems that now functioned as natural circuits. <words>153</words>

Mira's unique condition—sleepwalking with perfect recall—made her the ideal cartographer for this threshold between worlds. <words>169</words> She could map spiritual wisdom the way others mapped topography, tracing the invisible ley lines where her ancestors' research had accidentally torn holes in reality's fabric. <words>196</words>

The lightning bugs intensified their glow near a particular wall where equations still ghosted through the verdant overgrowth. <words>213</words> Her fingers traced formulae while her sleeping mind decoded patterns her waking self couldn't fully grasp. <words>229</words> This was why she returned annually, in those precious hours when commercial flights ceased and the electromagnetic interference cleared—she could hear the forest thinking through her grandmother's abandoned machines. <words>258</words>

A drawer opened at her unconscious touch, revealing journals wrapped in oilcloth. <words>270</words> Inside, her grandmother's notes described capturing "neural lightning"—the moment consciousness jumps synapses—and bottling it like fireflies. <words>286</words> The old woman had been mapping the same spiritual wisdom, just through different methods. <words>300</words>

Mira's collection began to resonate with something deeper in the laboratory's bowels, where flooded chambers gurgled with bioluminescent algae. <words>318</words> She descended further, her somnambulant state deepening as oxygen thinned, until she reached the heart of her grandmother's work: a greenhouse dome cracked but intact, where transgenic trees grew in perfect darkness, their bark inscribed with glowing neural patterns. <words>358</words>

Here was the ultimate woodland secret—consciousness itself could be cultivated, harvested, preserved. <words>370</words> The trees were her family's true ancestral home, each ring recording a generation's accumulated wisdom in living light. <words>388</words>

Mira added her bottled specimens to the constellation already suspended from the branches, completing another link in the chain. <words>407</words> Tomorrow she would wake at the departure gate, carrying only fragmentary memories and strange dreams. <words>423</words> But the map would be drawn, another year's wisdom encoded in living light, waiting for the next scout to decipher. <words>444</words> The forest kept its secrets by sharing them with those humble enough to receive them unconsciously. <words>460</words> Between flights, between sleeping and waking, between human and forest, the work continued. <words>473</words>
