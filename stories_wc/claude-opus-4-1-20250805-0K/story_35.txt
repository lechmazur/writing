The quiet gardener at the Universal Translation Center had spent seven years tending the rooftop garden where diplomats whispered secrets between the tomatoes. <words>23</words> Her mornings began amid bird calls that arrived with regularly random patterns—starlings on Tuesdays, mourning doves whenever it rained, ravens only when someone was about to remember something important. <words>51</words> Today the ravens circled. <words>55</words>

She found the embroidered purse half-buried beneath the sage, its golden threads depicting constellations she'd never seen yet somehow recognized. <words>75</words> The moment her fingers touched the worn silk, memories flickered through her mind like candlelight through water—recovered memories of a life before silence. <words>99</words> She remembered the silent retreat where she'd first learned to garden, where participants communicated only through the arrangement of stones and petals, creating a shared experience that transcended words. <words>128</words>

That was where she'd met him. <words>134</words> Another participant whose hands spoke volumes as they worked the soil together, whose eyes held entire conversations she'd never quite decoded. <words>155</words> He'd carried this purse, she remembered now, filled with seeds from a homeland whose language the Center had never catalogued. <words>175</words> They'd planted those seeds together during the retreat's final dawn, their fingers intertwining in the earth as bird calls announced the morning. <words>198</words>

The purse contained a single remaining seed and a note in his handwriting: "For when you're ready to understand the language of emotions." <words>222</words> She'd forgotten—no, she'd made herself forget—how he'd disappeared into the Center's vast archives, searching for a way to translate what hearts say when words fail. <words>248</words>

The Center's databases held ten thousand languages, but none for the particular dialect of longing that bloomed between two people who'd learned to speak in silence. <words>275</words> She planted the seed in a pot she could carry, knowing with improbable longing that somewhere in the building's infinite corridors, he was still searching. <words>300</words> The ravens called overhead, their cries regularly random yet perfectly timed, as if they too remembered the pattern of two souls learning each other's emotional vocabulary. <words>327</words>

Each morning she worked, the embroidered purse at her side, waiting for the seedling to reveal what species it was. <words>347</words> She understood now why she'd chosen this job, this place where every gesture required translation. <words>362</words> Her recovered memories flickered stronger each day, teaching her that some languages exist only in the space between two people who've shared absolute quiet. <words>387</words> When the plant finally bloomed—if it bloomed—she would know he'd found the answer, and the impossible distance between them would collapse into a single word that meant everything. <words>416</words>

The bird calls continued, regularly random, marking time in a language older than words. <words>430</words> She gardened and waited, her improbable longing taking root alongside the mysterious seed, both reaching toward a translation that might never come but was worth the patient tending. <words>458</words>
