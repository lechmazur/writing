Maya had lived with seventeen different families before the gravitational anomaly swallowed her neighborhood, leaving only the Hendersons' garage untouched—a pocket of normalcy where physics still obeyed old rules. <words>24</words>

She'd been cleaning it for three days now, sorting through boxes that floated at odd angles just beyond the doorway, their contents drifting in impossible spirals. <words>50</words>

The collection of smooth stones in her pocket clicked together, softly audible as she moved—each one stolen from a different foster home's garden, her private archaeology of abandonment. <words>79</words>

When the anomaly first appeared, everyone fled except Maya, who understood the fundamental truth she'd learned through years of displacement: adapt or perish. <words>102</words>

The garage had become her universe, its oil-stained floor the only solid ground left, and she'd begun to loosen her grip on the world beyond its threshold. <words>130</words>

On the third morning, she found it—a lottery ticket wedged beneath an old toolbox, someone's forgotten hope covered in dust. <words>150</words>

But across its faded numbers, written in what looked like Mr. Henderson's shaky hand, was a message: "The stones remember what gravity forgets." <words>173</words>

Maya pulled out her collection, watching them hover slightly when she released them, not falling but not quite floating either. <words>193</words>

She'd always thought she kept them out of spite, these smooth witnesses to her impermanence, but now she understood they were anchors. <words>215</words>

Each stone pulsed with a different weight—not physical, but emotional—and as she arranged them in a circle on the garage floor, the space within began to stabilize. <words>243</words>

The anomaly pressed against the garage walls, warping the metal with a sound like breathing, but inside her circle, physics remembered itself. <words>265</words>

Maya had spent her whole life afraid of being forgotten, of disappearing into another family's background, but here in this transformed world, her fear became something else. <words>293</words>

She opened the garage door fully for the first time since the event, watching neighbors' abandoned belongings orbit in slow, mournful paths. <words>315</words>

One by one, she threw her stones into the anomaly, each one creating a small sphere of normal gravity that expanded outward like ripples in reverse. <words>342</words>

The lottery ticket in her hand felt warm now, its cryptic message having unlocked something she'd carried all along—not just stones, but moments of connection she'd refused to acknowledge. <words>372</words>

As the last stone left her fingers, Maya felt the peculiar sensation of becoming lighter and heavier simultaneously, understanding finally that survival meant more than endurance. <words>398</words>

The anomaly began to recede, reality knitting itself back together around her makeshift anchor points, and Maya stood in the empty garage, transformed by her own willingness to let go. <words>428</words>

She kept only the lottery ticket, tucking it carefully into her pocket where the stones used to rest, a reminder that sometimes the universe speaks in whispers meant only for orphans who've learned to listen. <words>464</words>
