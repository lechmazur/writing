The water clock repair shop on Meridian Street concealed more than broken timepieces. <words>12</words> Behind its dusty windows, Violet Chen arranged copper tubes with the precision of a hidden assassin—which, between chapters of her mundane life, she was. <words>36</words> Her quietly flamboyant touches appeared everywhere: the purple silk lining of her tool case, the single peacock feather marking each completed contract, the way she hummed Vivaldi while dissolving bodies in acid. <words>68</words>

She'd grown to adore the domestic mysteries she created—husbands who slipped on mysteriously wet stairs, wives who choked on perfectly sized olive pits, elderly aunts whose medications somehow doubled in strength. <words>98</words> Each death appeared accidental, mundane, almost boring. <words>105</words> The real art lay in what came after. <words>113</words>

Violet attended every funeral, delivering bleak eulogies that mentioned hidden truths only the guilty would recognize. <words>129</words> "Margaret loved her husband's coffee so much, she never noticed when it tasted different," she'd said yesterday, watching the widower's face drain of color. <words>153</words> "Such devotion, drinking every drop even when it burned." <words>162</words>

The moss-covered lantern in her shop window had witnessed forty-three such performances. <words>175</words> Found in her grandmother's effects, it had inspired her unusual career—Grandmother had been a poisoner too, though less artistic, less devoted to transmuting pain into a masterpiece. <words>203</words> Where Grandmother had killed for money, Violet killed for symmetry, for the terrible beauty of justice served at breakfast tables and bathtubs. <words>225</words>

Today's client sobbed prettily in the consultation chair, mascara creating abstract art on her cheeks. <words>240</words> "He beats me where bruises won't show," she whispered. <words>249</words> "The police say without proof—" <words>254</words>

"Water clocks are delicate instruments," Violet interrupted, adjusting a bronze gear with theatrical melancholy. <words>268</words> "One mineral deposit in the wrong pipe, and time stops forever." <words>279</words> She smiled, that desperate humor that kept her sane. <words>288</words> "Does your husband take long baths?" <words>294</words>

The woman nodded, hope and horror mingling in her eyes. <words>304</words>

"Wonderful. Bath salts make such thoughtful anniversary gifts." <words>312</words> Violet wrapped a small package in silver paper, each fold precise as origami. <words>325</words> "Use the whole bag. For aromatherapy." <words>331</words>

Three weeks later, Violet stood at another funeral, her voice carrying across the mourners with practiced sorrow. <words>348</words> "Thomas loved his evening soaks, that sacred hour of solitude where a man could truly relax, truly let go, truly... stop breathing." <words>371</words> His widow sat in the front row, her bruises finally fading, her tears genuine but relieved. <words>388</words>

The moss-covered lantern glowed green in the shop window that night, keeping watch over Violet's terrible sanctuary where time stopped for the deserving, one domestic mystery at a time. <words>418</words>
