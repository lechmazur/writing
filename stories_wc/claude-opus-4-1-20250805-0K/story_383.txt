General Markov crumbled dried seaweed between his fingers, watching the flakes drift onto his coffee like ashes of dead stars. <words>18</words> The Dark Matter Diner existed between dimensions, a rest stop for travelers sliding through reality's cracks between rides on the cosmic rails. <words>39</words>

"You look tired," said the waitress, her smile crooked with mischievous wisdom. <words>51</words>

"Tired?" <words>52</words> Markov laughed, a sound like grinding gears. <words>59</words> "I've commanded armies against nightmares that eat logic for breakfast." <words>69</words> He gestured at the black-and-white photographs lining the diner's walls, each showing the same scene from different angles—a battlefield where soldiers fought their own shadows. <words>95</words>

"Those aren't decorations," she whispered. <words>100</words> "They're arcs. <words>102</words> Trajectories of shared anxieties frozen in silver halide." <words>110</words>

Markov studied them closer. <words>114</words> In each photograph, the shadows grew larger, more defined, until in the final frame, they sat at a negotiation table with their owners. <words>137</words> Rationally absurd, yet undeniably true—fear had crowned itself king while reason cowered in corners. <words>152</words>

"Every burnt-out general finds this place eventually," the waitress continued, refilling his cup with liquid that sparkled like nebulae. <words>171</words> "Between rides, between wars, between the person you were and whoever you're becoming." <words>185</words>

The seaweed in Markov's hand had once filtered oceans on a planet where water flowed upward. <words>201</words> Now it filtered something else—the weight of command, the burden of sending others to die for abstractions. <words>219</words> He'd won every battle except the one against his own gnawing dread. <words>231</words>

"The photographs," he said slowly, "they show renewal through surrender?" <words>241</words>

"Through recognition," she corrected. <words>245</words> "Watch." <words>246</words>

She pointed to a new photograph materializing on the wall. <words>256</words> In it, Markov saw himself—not as the decorated general, but as a man sharing coffee with his own terror, both of them laughing at the cosmic joke of existence. <words>285</words> The image shifted through gradients of gray, each shade revealing how his anxieties weren't enemies but messengers bearing uncomfortable truths. <words>305</words>

"Fear thrives on the throne because we put it there," she said. <words>317</words> "But reason and terror can share power, like dance partners who've learned each other's steps." <words>333</words>

Markov crushed the remaining seaweed, letting it fall like snow. <words>343</words> Each flake caught light differently, creating tiny arcs through space—trajectories of possibility. <words>355</words> He understood now why this diner existed in dark matter, in the universe's invisible scaffolding. <words>370</words> Some transformations required stepping outside normal space-time, outside rational thought, into places where absurdity made perfect sense. <words>387</words>

"Next ride arrives in three minutes," the waitress announced. <words>396</words>

Markov stood, renewed not through victory but through armistice with his own shadows. <words>409</words> The photographs on the walls shifted, showing his future—not commanding armies, but teaching others to negotiate with their fears. <words>428</words>

He left the seaweed on the counter, a tribute to transformation. <words>439</words> Outside, between the space between spaces, his next ride waited to carry him toward a different kind of courage. <words>458</words>
