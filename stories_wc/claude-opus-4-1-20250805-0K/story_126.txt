The shipwrecked merchant drifted past the observation deck's window, his cargo vessel nothing but debris spiraling through the void. <words>19</words> He'd been hauling Earth relics to the outer colonies when pirates struck, leaving him stranded on this forgotten station. <words>37</words> 

In the corner sat his most prized salvage: a rustic butter churn from humanity's pastoral past, honestly strange among the chrome and steel. <words>61</words> He approached it with aloof passion, running weathered fingers along its wooden staves while Earth hung dead below, visible through the massive viewport. <words>85</words> The last tree had fallen three cycles ago, broadcast live to every colony, yet the Council maintained their lie. <words>104</words>

"Earth thrives," they insisted, projecting holograms of green forests across every station. <words>116</words> 

The merchant knew better. <words>120</words> He'd seen the truth through telescope arrays, watched the final oxygen readings flatline. <words>133</words> His motivation crystallized: to shatter the grand illusion that kept humanity docile, prevented exodus, maintained the Council's power. <words>150</words>

Behind the butter churn, a travel poster clung to the wall—"Visit Historic Earth!"—its edges flaking like dead skin. <words>169</words> As he peeled it away, rebellious sparks danced from hidden circuitry beneath. <words>181</words> The poster wasn't decoration but camouflage for an emergency broadcast terminal, dormant since the station's abandonment. <words>197</words>

He began to ascend the maintenance ladder beside it, tools in hand, remembering his engineering training from before he'd turned to trade. <words>219</words> Each rung brought him closer to the transmission array, where he could override the Council's signal with truth. <words>237</words> The butter churn below held more than nostalgia—its false bottom concealed data drives with uncensored footage of Earth's death throes. <words>257</words>

His fingers worked with practiced precision, splicing cables while the observation deck's emergency lights cast long shadows. <words>274</words> The honestly strange juxtaposition struck him: here, surrounded by humanity's greatest technological achievement, he wielded truth like his ancestors wielded fire. <words>295</words> 

The first successful transmission sent rebellious sparks cascading through the station's dormant systems, lights flickering to life after decades of darkness. <words>317</words> Across the colonies, screens interrupted their false paradise broadcasts with raw footage of barren continents and empty oceans. <words>335</words>

The merchant descended slowly, knowing enforcement ships would arrive within hours. <words>346</words> He sat beside his butter churn, churning nothing but memories of green Earth while waiting. <words>361</words> Through the observation deck's vast window, stars watched with cold indifference as humanity's comfortable lie crumbled. <words>377</words> 

His aloof passion had served its purpose—not to save Earth, but to free humanity from false hope. <words>394</words> Sometimes, he mused, running his hand along the churn's smooth handle, the greatest mercy was bitter truth. <words>411</words> The ghost station hummed with new purpose as his broadcast repeated, each transmission another crack in the grand illusion. <words>430</words> Revolution, he'd learned from his shipwreck, often began with simply refusing to drown in comfortable lies. <words>446</words>
