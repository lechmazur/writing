Marcus shuffled through the dusty aisles of the Culinary Archives, a forgotten recipe library where cookbooks went to die, their spines cracking like arthritic knuckles. <words>20</words> He'd been the goldfish caretaker here for three months now—his second life, as he liked to joke, after his spectacular failure as a Michelin-starred chef had drowned him in debt and shame. <words>52</words> The irony wasn't lost on him that he, who once commanded kitchens, now fed flakes to creatures with seven-second memories. <words>71</words>

The aquarium bubbled in the corner, its inhabitants blissfully unaware of the guilt that rippled through Marcus every time he passed the seafood section. <words>95</words> That haunting echo of his past—the food poisoning incident that killed his career—still whispered accusations whenever he handled anything edible. <words>115</words>

He was tentatively fierce about maintaining this purgatory, attacking dust bunnies with the passion he once reserved for soufflés, when the weather turned. <words>138</words> The sudden April snowstorm knocked out the power, and within minutes, a woman burst through the door, shaking ice from her coat. <words>160</words>

"The fish!" she gasped, pointing at the darkened tank. <words>169</words>

Marcus recognized her immediately—Dr. Chen, the physician who'd signed his food safety certificate years ago, before everything went wrong. <words>187</words> Before her chart would confirm the turning point that destroyed seventeen diners' digestive systems and his reputation. <words>203</words>

"They're fine," he said, his voice carrying that playful cynicism he'd perfected. <words>215</words> "Unlike my customers, goldfish are surprisingly resilient." <words>222</words>

She squinted at him through the dim light, recognition dawning. <words>232</words> "Marcus? What are you—" <words>236</words>

"Serving a different kind of dish these days." <words>244</words> He pulled out his phone's flashlight, illuminating a shelf where someone had inexplicably left a toy soldier with a missing arm among the cookbooks. <words>268</words> "Even our decorations are damaged goods here." <words>275</words>

Dr. Chen picked up the soldier, turning it thoughtfully. <words>284</words> "You know, I never filed that report." <words>291</words>

Marcus froze. <words>293</words> "What?" <words>294</words>

"The tradition of destroying careers over one mistake—I wanted to disrupt it." <words>306</words> She set the soldier upright, facing forward despite its missing limb. <words>317</words> "Your food was extraordinary, Marcus. One bad batch of oysters shouldn't define you." <words>330</words>

The power flickered back on, the aquarium's filter humming to life. <words>341</words> Marcus watched the goldfish resume their endless circles, suddenly understanding their contentment. <words>353</words> "I've been hiding here, feeding fish recipes they'll never taste." <words>363</words>

"So stop hiding," she said simply. <words>369</words> "I run a hospice kitchen now. We need someone who understands that food can alleviate more than hunger." <words>387</words>

Marcus looked at the toy soldier, standing guard over forgotten flavors, and felt his guilt's echo finally quiet to a whisper. <words>408</words> Perhaps reincarnation wasn't about becoming something entirely new, but about finding where your broken pieces still fit. <words>425</words>

He turned to Dr. Chen with tentatively fierce hope. <words>434</words> "When do I start?" <words>438</words>
