Mei had wandered through seventeen countries designing fireworks that painted temporary galaxies across night skies, but she'd never returned home to the hidden library behind Jade Falls. <words>24</words> The waterfall's roar masked the entrance she'd discovered as a child, where her grandmother had taught her to read frost patterns on winter mornings before the sun erased them. <words>53</words> 

Now, clutching her collection of pressed leaves—one from each place she'd performed—Mei stood before the cascade's veil. <words>71</words> Each leaf held a memory: the maple from Kyoto where she'd first learned to augment traditional designs with her theoretically creative color combinations, the oak from Prague where she'd woven stories into smoke trails. <words>106</words> But none held the weight of the ginkgo leaf from this valley, pressed the day she'd left her grandmother without saying goodbye. <words>128</words>

The library remained unchanged, its books breathing with moisture and age. <words>139</words> Mei found her grandmother's journal on the same carved shelf, opened to a page dated three days before her death. <words>159</words> The entry described frost patterns on the library's single window—a car window salvaged from an old truck, incongruous yet perfect for catching morning ice. <words>184</words> Her grandmother had sketched the crystals' formation, noting how they revealed "subtle paths unfolding, like fireworks in reverse, gathering light instead of scattering it." <words>208</words>

Mei pressed her forehead against the cold glass, watching her breath create new frost. <words>223</words> The patterns emerged slowly: branching dendrites that mirrored the veins in her pressed leaves, each crystal a decision point in time's ephemeral nature. <words>247</words> She understood now what her grandmother had been teaching her—not just to read the frost, but to recognize how every fleeting moment contained infinite pathways. <words>273</words>

Opening her satchel, Mei arranged the pressed leaves across the journal's pages, each one marking a year she'd spent running from this regret. <words>297</words> The familiar puzzle revealed itself: her grandmother hadn't needed words of farewell. <words>309</words> She'd known Mei would return when ready, would find this message written in ice and preserved in ink. <words>327</words> The old woman had understood that some artists needed to scatter their light across the world before learning to gather it home. <words>349</words>

Mei began sketching her next firework design in the journal's margins, augmenting her grandmother's frost patterns with bursts of color that would bloom and fade like breath on glass. <words>379</words> Tomorrow night, she would launch it from the cliff above the falls—a conversation between earth and sky, ice and fire, the paths taken and those that waited still. <words>408</words> The waterfall would reflect the light, creating doubles of each spark, as if time itself had folded to let grandmother and granddaughter share one last sunrise. <words>435</words>
