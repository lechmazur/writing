Margot's fingers traced the ancient petroglyphs while her other hand clutched the scuffed plastic comb she'd found wedged between the stones. <words>18</words> The tour group behind her hummed with anticipation as their guide paused between verses of an old Celtic song, letting the stone circle's silence wash over them. <words>46</words>

"Excuse me," she interrupted with practiced politeness, "but you're misreading the symbols entirely." <words>59</words>

The guide's smile faltered. <words>63</words> Margot had built her reputation as Tokyo's most ruthless flower arranger by seeing patterns others missed—the way a wilting petal could transform an entire composition, how negative space could scream louder than color. <words>95</words> Now, standing in this Scottish stone circle, her intellectually spontaneous mind connected dots the archaeologists had overlooked for centuries. <words>114</words>

"The spiral here," she pointed with the comb, "it's not about seasons." <words>126</words> She'd driven here on impulse after a chance conversation with a hitchhiker who'd mentioned how the stones seemed to watch visitors, burdening them with unspoken knowledge. <words>152</words> During their three-hour journey, discussing everything from Brexit to Buddhist philosophy, she'd realized something crucial: the watcher's burden wasn't metaphorical. <words>173</words>

"These marks distinguish between those who observe and those who act," Margot continued, her voice carrying the same authority she used when rejecting substandard orchids from suppliers. <words>200</words> The comb's teeth caught sunlight, casting tiny shadows that perfectly aligned with the rock art's grooves. <words>216</words> "Someone stood here, holding something just like this, using it as a key." <words>229</words>

The guide opened his mouth to protest, but Margot was already moving, positioning the comb against different stones, her movements precise yet anarchically dismissive of the velvet rope barriers. <words>257</words> Each placement revealed new patterns—not primitive attempts at recording astronomical events, but a sophisticated system for encoding the burden of witnessing history unfold. <words>280</words>

"My God," whispered an elderly tourist, "the shadows form letters." <words>290</words>

Indeed, as Margot worked, modern words emerged: WATCH, REMEMBER, CHOOSE. <words>299</words> Her flower-arranging instincts had taught her that beauty often emerged from chaos, that the most profound statements required breaking conventional rules while maintaining surface civility. <words>323</words> This stone circle operated on the same principle—ancient rebels encoding dissent within accepted religious architecture. <words>338</words>

The guide resumed his song, but now everyone heard it differently. <words>349</words> Between his verses, in those pregnant pauses, the stones seemed to whisper their true purpose: not worship sites but libraries of resistance, where knowledge was hidden in plain sight for those brave enough to distinguish pattern from coincidence. <words>388</words>

Margot pocketed the comb, already planning her next arrangement—birds of paradise bent at impossible angles, baby's breath scattered like static, roses stripped of thorns but not their danger. <words>416</words> She would encode this discovery in petals and stems, continuing the stone circle's legacy of polite anarchy, bearing the watcher's burden with the same ruthless grace she brought to everything she touched. <words>448</words>
