The hologram repair shop hummed with broken light, its flickering displays casting rainbow shadows across Moss's weathered face. <words>17</words> She clutched the dented lunch tin—her grandmother's last gift—containing seeds that might no longer exist anywhere else in the city. <words>37</words> The tin was uniquely common, the kind every factory worker once carried, yet irreplaceable now that the factories had become vertical farms. <words>60</words>

"Another audition?" asked Chen, the shop owner, not looking up from a malfunctioning projection of Shakespeare's ghost. <words>77</words> 

Moss nodded, though uncertainty gnawed at her druidic training. <words>86</words> The city's back-alley theater auditions had become her pilgrimage, each cramped stage hidden behind hologram repair shops, virtual reality cafes, and synthetic meat vendors. <words>111</words> She wandered between them throughout library hours—nine to five, when the streets emptied and only the desperate remained. <words>130</words>

Her obligation wasn't to the Council of Druids who'd trained her, nor to the dying parks they protected. <words>148</words> It was to something deeper: the need to forge beauty from anarchy, to make wildness bloom in concrete cracks. <words>168</words> The theater directors wanted spectacle, illusion, control. <words>175</words> She offered them real vines that responded to actors' emotions, moss that grew in patterns matching the script's rhythm. <words>194</words>

"They'll reject you again," Chen said, adjusting a holographic fern that kept glitching into a palm tree. <words>211</words> "Directors want predictable magic, not actual nature." <words>218</words>

But Moss felt it—that lethargic excitement, like sap rising in spring, slow but unstoppable. <words>233</words> Each rejection taught her something. <words>238</words> The tin's dented surface reflected the shop's chaotic light shows: advertisements for plays that might never open, repairs that might never complete. <words>261</words>

She'd already auditioned at seven venues this week. <words>269</words> The Undermount Theatre wanted her to make plastic trees dance. <words>279</words> The Violet Stage asked if she could make holographic flowers smell real. <words>291</words> They didn't understand that her gift was imperfection—the way real leaves never matched, how genuine growth meant accepting chaos. <words>311</words>

At four-thirty, library hours nearly over, she stood. <words>319</words> The last audition waited three blocks away, behind a shop specializing in repairing holograms of extinct animals. <words>336</words> Chen finally looked up. <words>340</words>

"Why keep trying?" he asked. <words>345</words>

She opened the tin, revealing seeds that sparkled with their own light—not holographic, but alive. <words>361</words> "Because someone needs to remember that beauty isn't programmed," she said. <words>372</words> "It's cultivated from disorder, tended through uncertainty." <words>379</words>

The shop's broken holograms suddenly seemed intentional, their glitches forming patterns like wind through leaves. <words>394</words> Moss smiled, understanding finally that her obligation wasn't to succeed at these auditions. <words>407</words> It was to keep planting seeds of possibility in places that had forgotten what unscripted growth looked like. <words>425</words> She walked toward her final audition, carrying her dented tin like a promise that chaos and beauty were never really opposites—just different stages of the same wild performance. <words>454</words>
