The orbital debris tracking station hosted monthly picnics on its observation deck, where Earth hung like a marble against the void. <words>20</words> Marcus arrived as humanity's uneasy emissary, clutching a thin coathanger he'd found floating in the airlock—evidence of the station's makeshift repairs. <words>42</words> He'd come to learn universal patterns from the crew who tracked ten thousand fragments of human failure spinning through space. <words>62</words>

"Every piece tells a story," Dr. Chen said, pointing at her screens while balancing a sandwich. <words>78</words> Behind her, the break room fridge door held postcards from Earth, each one pinned with recycled wire from old satellites. <words>98</words> Marcus lurched forward when artificial gravity hiccupped, his coathanger catching the postcards and setting them rustling like autumn leaves. <words>117</words>

Through the rustle of postcards pinned to a fridge door, he heard it—a rhythm matching the orbital periods Chen tracked. <words>138</words> "You're listening," she observed, consistently surprising him with her ability to read people while monitoring space junk. <words>155</words> "Most diplomats just talk." <words>159</words>

During their third picnic together, Marcus twisted the coathanger into the shape of intersecting orbits. <words>174</words> "Redemption has branches," Chen said suddenly, watching him work. <words>184</words> "That defunct satellite we're tracking? <words>189</words> It failed its mission but now helps us predict collision patterns." <words>200</words> She pointed to a postcard from Mumbai. <words>207</words> "Sent by the engineer who designed it." <words>214</words> "He thanks us weekly for finding purpose in his mistake." <words>224</words>

Marcus studied the wall of postcards throughout picnics that followed, each sender seeking forgiveness for contributions to the orbital graveyard. <words>244</words> The coathanger became his teaching tool, bent into different shapes to show visiting officials how debris could be repurposed, retrieved, redeemed. <words>265</words> Chen's screens revealed the universal patterns he'd sought: entropy and renewal, destruction and creation, spinning together in predictable chaos. <words>284</words>

"Your unease is showing," Chen mentioned during their seventh picnic, as Earth's terminator line crawled across continents below. <words>302</words> Marcus nodded, finally understanding his role. <words>308</words> He wasn't meant to bring answers but questions, not solutions but possibilities. <words>320</words> The branches of redemption grew from admitting failure, tracking consequences, and finding unexpected purpose in the wreckage. <words>337</words>

On his final visit, Marcus left the coathanger twisted into a peace symbol, hanging among the postcards. <words>354</words> "Accidental wisdom," Chen called it, smiling as she logged another piece of debris—a derelict weather satellite beginning its decades-long spiral home. <words>376</words> The station continued its vigil, hosting picnics where humanity's messengers learned that watching our mistakes orbit back toward us was perhaps the most universal pattern of all. <words>405</words>
