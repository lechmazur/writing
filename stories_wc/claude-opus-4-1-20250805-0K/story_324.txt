The secret agent headquarters had been evacuated for three years, but Advisor Chen still heard the echo of footsteps in the abandoned corridors—always his own, always alone. <words>25</words> In the hush of a simmering future where dreams bled into surveillance protocols, he clutched his clearance badge with trembling fingers, knowing he shouldn't be here. <words>50</words> The rumor had consumed him: somewhere in Lab Seven waited proof that the dreamer's calling wasn't just neural static but humanity's next evolutionary leap. <words>74</words> He'd chased this whisper beyond all reason, past career suicide, past his wife's ultimatum, past the agency's dissolution order. <words>93</words>

The fluorescent lights still hummed in Lab Seven, casting everything in a clearly ambiguous glow—neither fully operational nor completely dead. <words>113</words> There, on the steel examination table, sat a brain suspended in preservative fluid, its jar labeled "DUPLICATE" in fading red marker. <words>134</words> Chen's reflection warped across the glass surface as he approached, his insecurity manifesting in each hesitant step. <words>151</words> This was supposed to be paradise, the agency's crown achievement: consciousness preservation, the promise of immortal expertise. <words>168</words> Instead, the fractured idyll had collapsed when the first preserved agents began receiving the dreams—vivid, prophetic, maddening. <words>185</words>

He reached out to touch the jar, then pulled back with a nervous jab of his hand through empty air. <words>205</words> The brain wasn't just any duplicate; the neural patterns matched his own perfectly, down to the synaptic scarring from his childhood accident. <words>227</words> How long had they been growing his replacement, preparing for the day his doubts would overwhelm his usefulness? <words>245</words> The echo of his footsteps suddenly doubled, tripled, though he stood perfectly still. <words>258</words> Through the abandoned place, the sound multiplied into a symphony of phantom movement, each reverberation carrying whispers of dreams he'd never had. <words>280</words>

The brain pulsed once with bioluminescent activity, and Chen understood with terrible clarity. <words>293</words> The dreamer's calling wasn't coming from outside—it had always been here, waiting in these suspended minds. <words>309</words> Every preserved consciousness had become a receiver, picking up transmissions from a future that needed guides who could navigate between sleeping and waking worlds. <words>333</words> His duplicate had been dreaming for him, experiencing visions he was too frightened to accept directly. <words>349</words>

Chen pressed his palm against the cold glass, feeling the vibration of thoughts not quite his own. <words>366</words> The agency had built their perfect advisory system: original minds to doubt and question, duplicates to dream and know. <words>385</words> In this fractured paradise of abandoned ambitions, he finally understood his role. <words>397</words> The insecure advisor and the dreaming brain were two halves of evolution's next equation, forever separated by glass and fear, forever connected by purpose. <words>421</words> The footsteps echoed again, but now Chen recognized them—they belonged to the person he would become, walking through futures his duplicate had already dreamed. <words>445</words> He lifted the jar carefully, cradling his other self, and began the long walk toward whatever transformation awaited them both. <words>465</words>
