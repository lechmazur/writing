The marketplace sprawled inside the colossal hourglass, where sand trickled eternally past vendor stalls selling memories and broken promises. <words>17</words> Mira's nimble fingers danced through pockets with practiced grace, but her heart wasn't in the theft anymore—she was searching for something else entirely. <words>40</words>

The broken pencil sharpener in her coat pocket pressed against her ribs, a reminder of her father's last gift before he'd vanished into the sand-streams above. <words>66</words> He'd whispered something that night, a secret that had burned through her soul ever since: the hourglass wasn't a prison, but a sanctuary hiding from something worse. <words>93</words>

She hummed nervously, that peculiar mix of cheer and dissatisfaction that defined everyone trapped here—blithe discontent, they called it, like singing at a funeral. <words>117</words> The vendors hawked their wares with tastefully offensive jokes about time's cruelty, making light of their eternal predicament while tears threatened behind painted smiles. <words>141</words>

"Looking for something specific, light-fingers?" <words>146</words> Old Magnus called from his stall of forgotten songs. <words>155</words>

Mira approached, her hope flickering like candlelight. <words>162</words> "I need to find someone who remembers the chalk lines." <words>172</words>

Magnus froze. <words>174</words> In this place, chalk lines on sidewalks were myth—marks that appeared when someone was ready to leave, then faded as quickly as courage. <words>198</words> "That knowledge costs more than coins, girl." <words>205</words>

"I'll pay with truth," she said, pulling out the sharpener. <words>215</words> "My father's secret—it's about why we're really here." <words>223</words>

The old man's eyes widened. <words>228</words> Without warning, he began to sing, his voice cracking on an ancient melody about devotion's depths, about those who chose imprisonment to protect the world beyond. <words>254</words>

Mira found herself harmonizing, the spontaneous karaoke duet drawing a crowd. <words>265</words> Their voices wove together, and as they sang, something impossible happened—her father materialized from the gathering listeners, translucent but real, tears streaming down his ghostly face. <words>291</words>

"The secret burns because it's love," he whispered between verses. <words>301</words> "We're not prisoners—we're guardians. <words>305</words> The hourglass doesn't trap us; we trap something else, something that would devour reality if released." <words>321</words>

The song crescendoed, and Mira understood. <words>327</words> Every pickpocket's theft, every vendor's sale, every moment of their blithe discontent—it all generated the energy that kept the seal intact. <words>348</words> Her father had discovered this truth and chosen to fade into the sand rather than risk breaking their sacred, secret duty. <words>369</words>

As the duet ended, chalk lines bloomed beneath her feet, glowing faintly. <words>381</words> But Mira stepped back, pocketing the sharpener again. <words>389</words> She finally understood the depths of devotion—sometimes love meant staying, not leaving. <words>401</words> The lines faded away, and she smiled her first genuine smile, ready to steal with purpose. <words>417</words>
