The minstrel had lingered too long in the giant's dining room, watching the rush hour chaos of enormous servants preparing the evening feast. <words>19</words> His fingers traced the witch's gnarled wooden ladle hidden in his coat, its surface rough as the meteorite fragment he'd once touched in a distant marketplace. <words>45</words> That cosmic texture had awakened something in him then, a promise of rejuvenation beyond his mundane existence of singing for copper coins in taverns. <words>69</words>

He was openly private, this contradiction his shield—performing ballads that revealed nothing while his eyes betrayed everything. <words>86</words> The giant's household staff thundered past, their footsteps shaking crystal goblets the size of bathtubs, yet none noticed the small human pressed against the mahogany table leg. <words>114</words> Rush hour in a giant's castle meant survival through stillness, through becoming furniture yourself. <words>128</words>

The ladle pulsed warm against his ribs. <words>135</words> Three nights ago, the dying witch had pressed it into his hands without words, her silence affirming what his songs had always sought—transformation, escape, purpose beyond entertainment. <words>162</words> "When you find the place where titans dine," she'd whispered, "stir the air itself." <words>176</words>

Now, amid the controlled pandemonium of dinner preparation, he understood. <words>186</words> The gentle turmoil of his heart matched the kitchen's rhythm—urgent yet careful, desperate yet patient. <words>202</words> He drew out the ladle, its gnarled surface catching the chandelier light that blazed forty feet above. <words>219</words>

As he stirred the empty air, reality rippled. <words>227</words> The meteorite's memory lived in the wood's grain, that alien roughness conducting energies no earthly tree should know. <words>245</words> The massive spoons and forks hanging on the walls began to hum his unsung melodies, the ones he'd never dared perform, the ones that lived in the silence between notes. <words>275</words>

The servants slowed, then stopped, caught in the ladle's expanding influence. <words>286</words> Time thickened like honey in the giant's dining room, and the minstrel felt his mundane self peeling away like old paint. <words>307</words> Each circular motion rejuvenated not his body but his purpose, transforming him from entertainer to something more primal—a keeper of thresholds, a stirrer of possibilities. <words>332</words>

The giant's footsteps approached, earthquake-heavy, but the minstrel continued stirring. <words>342</words> Silence affirmed his choice more than any applause ever had. <words>352</words> The rush hour chaos had become a frozen tableau, and in that stillness, he finally understood why he'd always lingered in doorways, on bridges, at crossroads. <words>378</words> He wasn't meant to stay anywhere; he was meant to stir the spaces between, to rejuvenate the forgotten passages that connected all worlds. <words>401</words>

The ladle completed its final circle, and reality exhaled. <words>410</words> The minstrel vanished into the shimmer he'd created, leaving only a faint melody hanging in the giant's dining room, a song that would play every rush hour thereafter, gentle turmoil transformed into purposeful magic. <words>444</words>
