Father Marcus clutched the ancient abacus, its wooden frame smooth from centuries of calculation, though half its beads had fallen away like lost prayers. <words>18</words> The labyrinth orchard stretched before him, giant bean stalks spiraling upward into pearl-gray clouds, their leaves casting shadows that formed intricate patterns in the morning snow. <words>45</words> He had been unapologetically confused since abandoning his parish three winters ago, but here, in this place where mathematics met mythology, his bewilderment felt almost holy. <words>71</words>

The snow patterns between the towering stalks formed a map only he could read—a gift from his seminary days studying sacred geometry. <words>93</words> Each footprint left by previous travelers created vectors and angles, probability paths that the remaining beads on his abacus could still calculate, though imperfectly. <words>117</words> This was the price of complacency: years of routine sermons had dulled his ability to see divine mathematics in chaos, yet fate had led him here anyway. <words>144</words>

He began to jog, following the crystalline trails that wound deeper into the vegetative maze. <words>159</words> The bean stalks hummed with a dull radiance, neither fully alive nor dead, suspended in perpetual growth toward heavens that might not exist. <words>183</words> Marcus had once preached about Jacob's ladder, but these stalks were different—they demanded climbing without promise of angels, only the certainty of clouds. <words>207</words>

Through the hush of fate unraveling, he heard it: the subtle click of cosmic tumblers falling into place. <words>225</words> Each missing bead on his abacus represented a choice he hadn't made, a congregant he'd failed to comfort, a doubt he'd refused to acknowledge. <words>249</words> The snow patterns shifted with his movement, creating new geometries that defied the predetermined paths his broken calculator suggested. <words>268</words>

He jogged faster now, breath misting in the thin air, following neither the snow's guidance nor the abacus's incomplete equations. <words>288</words> To step beyond fate's design meant abandoning both the certainty of mathematics and the comfort of confusion. <words>305</words> The stalks began to thin, revealing a clearing where snow fell upward, defying gravity's sermon. <words>320</words>

Marcus stopped, understanding finally that his complacency hadn't been in losing faith, but in believing faith operated on binary calculations—saved or damned, believer or doubter. <words>344</words> The missing beads weren't flaws; they were spaces for uncertainty, for the divine arithmetic that transcends human comprehension. <words>362</words> He set the abacus in the snow, watching it sink slowly, a fossil of his former certainty. <words>379</words> The labyrinth had no exit because it was never meant to be solved, only experienced. <words>394</words> In the dull radiance of endless bean stalks, Marcus finally found what he'd lost in the pulpit: the courage to be lost, beautifully and completely. <words>419</words>
