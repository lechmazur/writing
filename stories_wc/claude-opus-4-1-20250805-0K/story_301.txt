Professor Thaddeus Crane discovered the time capsule beneath his grandmother's jazz-age speakeasy, its brass hinges groaning as he lifted the lid. <words>18</words> Inside, among yellowed sheet music and tarnished instruments, lay an oversized pewter mug covered in cryptic codes that seemed to shift when viewed peripherally. <words>43</words> His fingers, protected by worn gardening gloves he'd inherited from her estate, traced the etchings with the detached curiosity of a philosopher encountering proof of his most radical theories. <words>72</words>

The codes weren't merely decorative—they were instructions, he realized, for accessing what his grandmother's diary called "the cosmic frequencies." <words>91</words> She had been more than a bootlegger; she had been seeking something beyond prohibition's petty restrictions, something that broke every expectation of what the roaring twenties could contain. <words>119</words>

Thaddeus began knitting, just as the codes instructed, using copper wire instead of yarn. <words>133</words> The repetitive motion activated something in the mug's etchings, causing them to glow with a sickly phosphorescence that made his vision blur. <words>156</words> Each stitch seemed to impair his connection to conventional reality, replacing it with something vast and terrible. <words>173</words>

Through the haze, he understood his grandmother's true legacy: she had discovered how to harvest wonder itself, distilling cosmic awe into something tangible, tradeable. <words>197</words> The jazz age hadn't ended naturally—she had sold its exuberance, one mystical transaction at a time, leaving the world grayer in her wake. <words>221</words>

The ethical implications should have horrified him, but Thaddeus felt only numb fascination as the knitting continued, his hands moving automatically now. <words>243</words> The copper wire formed patterns that matched the mug's codes perfectly, creating a resonance that opened channels his philosopher's training had never prepared him for. <words>268</words>

He saw it all: how his grandmother had used her speakeasy as a front, serving drinks from this very mug to unsuspecting patrons. <words>291</words> Each sip had stolen a fragment of their capacity for wonder, which she then wove into something else—something she sold to those who had lost their own ability to dream. <words>322</words>

The gardening gloves, he realized, weren't for gardening at all. <words>332</words> They were insulation against the raw cosmic energy that flowed through the wire, protection his grandmother had learned to use after her first attempts had left her fingers permanently numb. <words>362</words>

As Thaddeus completed the final stitch, the mug revealed its last secret: the process was irreversible. <words>378</words> He had inherited not just her tools but her burden—to continue harvesting wonder from a world already running dry, breaking every expectation of what a philosopher should do with forbidden knowledge. <words>409</words>

He set down the needles, understanding finally why his grandmother had hidden everything in a time capsule. <words>426</words> Some legacies were too heavy for immediate inheritance; they required the numb fascination that only decades of separation could provide. <words>446</words>

The jazz age was over, but its most ethically questionable innovation lived on, pulsing in his copper-wrapped hands. <words>464</words>
