The flash-paper alchemist knelt among frozen apple cores, arranging them in spirals across the crater floor. [16] Each placement took minutes—her fingers moving with the deliberate care of someone threading memories through needle eyes. [32] Above the withered orchard, aurora lights flickered green against stars that seemed too close, too eager to fall. [50]

She had been here three months now, in this subarctic crater where apple trees grew wrong and died beautiful. [69] Their branches reached downward instead of up, roots grasping at sky, as if the world had inverted here long ago. [90] The alchemist understood such reversals. [95] Flash-paper was her medium—substances that burned instantly, leaving only afterimages—but here she worked with permanence. [111]

From her satchel, she withdrew the storybook illustration plate, its brass surface etched with constellations that had never existed. [131] Or rather, constellations that existed only in the heartbeats between seconds, when blood paused in veins and the world held its breath. [155] She traced the engravings with one finger while her other hand continued placing apple cores, bottle caps, and fragments of old satellites in precise formations. [181]

The pattern was nearly complete. [186] Six weeks to gather the materials. [192] Eight weeks to understand their weight, their willingness to hold light. [203] Two more weeks to hear what the withered trees whispered about the stars they'd swallowed during their inverted growth. [222]

This was why she'd come—to translate heartbeats into maps. [232] Not the heartbeats of humans, but of places where physics stuttered and geography dreamed. [246] The crater itself had a pulse, slow and deep, one beat every seventeen hours. [261] She'd counted thirty-four beats so far. [268] Each one shifted her pattern slightly, and she adjusted with the patience of tides eroding stone. [285]

The safekept starlight was the crucial element. [292] Not metaphorical starlight, but actual photons she'd captured in crystallized flash-paper, preserved in that instant before combustion. [310] She'd been collecting it for years in small vials, each one containing the light from stars that had already died, their messages still traveling, still hoping to arrive. [339]

She uncorked the first vial. [344]

The light didn't pour—it remembered. [350] It remembered the furnace of its birth, the long journey through vacuum, the moment of capture. [367] She guided it into the pattern's center, where it pooled like mercury made of dawn. [384] The apple cores began to shimmer. [390] The bottle caps sang frequencies only the withered trees could hear. [401]

This was the delicate moment. [406] The world truly held its breath now—wind stopped, even the aurora above froze mid-undulation. [421] The alchemist moved with the slowness of growing crystals, placing the illustration plate at the pattern's heart. [439] The etched constellations aligned with the arranged debris, creating a second sky on the crater floor. [456]

She pulled out her flash-paper, the special batch she'd prepared with sap from the inverted trees. [474] One sheet placed here, another there, each one a bridge between the pattern and something larger. [491] When she struck the ignition spark, the paper didn't burn—it transformed into doorways the size of postcards, each one opening onto the same moment from different angles. [520]

Through them, she could see it: the crater's heartbeat made visible. [532] Lines of force radiating from deep below, pulsing with colors that had no names because they existed between wavelengths. [552] She began to trace these lines onto the illustration plate with a stylus of compressed starlight, each stroke sealing the map permanently into the brass. [578]

The withered orchard shivered. [582] Its inverted trees straightened slightly, as if remembering which way was supposed to be up. [597] The alchemist continued her work, patient as stone, precise as the space between heartbeats, creating from discarded things a map of how the world breathes when no one is watching. [630]

When the final line was sealed, the pattern collapsed inward, leaving only the plate—now warm with captured cartography, pulsing with the quiet rhythm of impossible places. [656]

She stood slowly, joints stiff from hours of kneeling, and held the plate up to the subarctic stars. [675] Through its surface, she could see the connections—every withered orchard, every inverted place, every crater where the world's heartbeat could be heard. [699]

The flash-paper alchemist smiled and began her long walk home, carrying directions to everywhere that shouldn't exist. [717]
