Marcus had walked dogs for Manhattan's elite for seven years, but the Blackwood estate was different. <words>16</words> The mansion squatted on the Hudson like a gargoyle, its dining room windows glowing amber as color bled from day into night. <words>37</words> He entered through the servants' door with his carefully careless stride—the practiced gait of someone who belonged nowhere and everywhere simultaneously. <words>58</words>

The dining room stretched before him, its mahogany table supporting Mrs. Blackwood's prized botanical collection: pressed flowers sealed between glass plates, each specimen harvested from graveyards across five continents. <words>86</words> The mastiffs waited by the French doors, their silence louder than any bark. <words>99</words> This was their arrangement—unspoken, unwritten, understood. <words>105</words>

Marcus had met Mrs. Blackwood three months ago at a blood drive, where she'd sat beside him, needles in both their arms, watching their life drain into plastic bags. <words>134</words> "You have steady hands," she'd observed, noting how he didn't flinch. <words>145</words> "I need someone who can stand where fear dares not tread." <words>156</words> She'd handed him a business card stained with a single drop of blood—hers or his, he never knew. <words>174</words>

Now, every evening at this liminal hour, he came to walk her dogs through the mansion's halls while she dined alone among her dead flowers. <words>199</words> The mastiffs knew which rooms to avoid, which shadows held more than darkness. <words>212</words> Marcus had learned to justify the inexplicable: doors that opened inward when pushed out, portraits whose eyes weren't paint, the botanical specimens that occasionally bloomed behind their glass prisons. <words>241</words>

Tonight, Mrs. Blackwood sat at the table's head, her fingers tracing the outline of a black dahlia. <words>258</words> "Do you know why I chose you, Marcus?" <words>266</words> Her voice barely disturbed the crystalline silence. <words>273</words>

He could have lied, could have mentioned his references, his experience. <words>284</words> Instead, he spoke the truth that lived in their silent agreement. <words>295</words> "Because I've already given my blood." <words>301</words> He gestured to the botanical collection. <words>307</words> "And I understand that some things feed differently." <words>315</words>

She smiled, a carefully careless expression that never reached her eyes. <words>326</words> "The dogs are hungry." <words>330</words>

Marcus clipped the leashes to the mastiffs' collars, feeling the familiar weight of their expectation. <words>345</words> As he led them from the dining room into the mansion's breathing darkness, he heard Mrs. Blackwood whisper to her pressed flowers, and for just a moment—in that loud silence where the mundane and monstrous shook hands—he could have sworn they whispered back. <words>389</words>

He walked on, steady and unflinching, earning his blood money one twilight at a time. <words>405</words>
