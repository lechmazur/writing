The lunar base's observation deck held its breath as Celeste pressed her palm against the worn doormat corner she'd torn from Earth's last sanctuary. <words>20</words> Lukewarm mage by classification—neither powerful enough to matter nor weak enough to dismiss—she'd smuggled this fragment past security, clinging to echoes of home. <words>45</words>

Through the viewport, Earth hung like a burnt pearl against velvet darkness. <words>58</words> The colony's artificial atmosphere generator hummed its loyally peculiar rhythm, matching the pulse she remembered from her grandmother's workshop where stage fog once swirled during puppet shows. <words>85</words> Those ephemeral silhouettes had taught her that shadows could speak truths solid forms concealed. <words>100</words>

In the hush before someone opens a private journal, that sacred pause where possibility crystallizes, Celeste unfurled her fingers. <words>119</words> The doormat corner released microscopic spores—engineered, patient, waiting. <words>128</words> They rose like ghost dancers, forming shapes in the recycled air that only her mediocre magic could perceive. <words>146</words>

"Stop." <words>147</words> Commander Reeves materialized from the corridor, his military augmentations crackling with barely contained force. <words>162</words> "The Council knows what you're attempting." <words>169</words>

Celeste didn't turn. <words>172</words> "They know I'm trying to paint a future free from fear?" <words>184</words> Her voice carried the charred serenity of someone who'd already lost everything worth protecting. <words>199</words> "These spores will terraform the dead zones, Commander. <words>208</words> Give Earth's children somewhere to return." <words>214</words>

"Unauthorized biological experiments threaten the colony's stability." <words>221</words> His hand moved to his weapon. <words>228</words>

The spores responded to her emotional frequency, her loyally peculiar gift that the Council had overlooked when classifying her as merely lukewarm. <words>250</words> They expanded into a living canvas between them, projecting ephemeral silhouettes of Earth's former forests, phantom meadows dancing in impossible wind. <words>272</words>

The clash came not as violence but as vision—Reeves's augmented perception colliding with her organic magic. <words>289</words> Through the swirling fog of memory and possibility, he saw what she saw: children playing beneath real trees, breathing unfiltered air, their feet finding purchase on soil instead of steel. <words>320</words>

His weapon lowered. <words>323</words> The doormat corner in her hand pulsed with ancestral warmth. <words>334</words>

"The Council monitors everything," he whispered, but his tone had shifted, infected by her charred serenity. <words>350</words>

"Not everything," Celeste replied, watching her spores settle into the base's ventilation system like seeds of revolution. <words>368</words> "They never monitor the lukewarm ones who cling to echoes." <words>379</words>

In the observation deck's recycled twilight, two unlikely conspirators stood amid swirling possibilities, while Earth waited below for its children to remember how to heal rather than flee. <words>407</words> The torn doormat corner had carried more than memory—it had smuggled hope past fear's checkpoint, one peculiar, loyal spore at a time. <words>430</words>
