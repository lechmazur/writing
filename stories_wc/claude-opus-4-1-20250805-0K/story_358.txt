The arctic research greenhouse gleamed under perpetual twilight, its glass walls reflecting endless ice while tropical ferns pressed against the panes like trapped souls. <words>22</words> Mordecai, an old-fashioned mage in wool robes incongruous among the scientists' parkas, wandered the humid rows with purposefully aimless steps, following a pattern only he perceived. <words>49</words> The fragment of pharaoh's coffin lay on the specimen table, hieroglyphs pulsing faintly whenever he passed—an artifact discovered beneath permafrost that shouldn't exist. <words>73</words>

The unfolding riddle had begun three days ago when mirror reflections in the greenhouse's monitoring screens showed him scenes that weren't there: ancient priests, frozen tombs, pathways between worlds. <words>102</words> Each ephemeral encounter lasted seconds, but revealed another piece of the puzzle connecting Egypt's death-magic to this arctic frontier. <words>122</words> The other researchers dismissed his observations as cabin fever, but during playground time—that mandated hour when staff socialized to combat isolation madness—Mordecai discovered the truth. <words>148</words>

Children's laughter echoed from the recreation dome as he pressed his palm against the coffin fragment. <words>164</words> The greenhouse mirrors shimmered, and suddenly she stood before him: the pharaoh's daughter, preserved in reflection, neither alive nor dead. <words>184</words> "You seek the uncharted frontier between death and forever," she whispered, her voice carrying sanctified dread that made the tropical plants wilt. <words>207</words> "But the passage demands a price of warmth in this frozen place." <words>219</words>

Mordecai understood with terrible clarity. <words>224</words> The riddle wasn't about finding something—it was about giving. <words>234</words> He reached through the mirror's surface, feeling reality tear like wet paper, and pulled the spectral child into his arms. <words>254</words> She was cold as permafrost, real as sorrow, and he held her close in a desperate cuddle, sharing his living warmth while frost spread across his robes. <words>282</words> The greenhouse temperature plummeted; ice crystals formed on orchid petals. <words>292</words>

"The frontier opens," she gasped against his shoulder, and Mordecai saw it in every reflection: a vast necropolis suspended between dimensions, where Egyptian mysteries merged with polar eternities. <words>320</words> This was why the coffin fragment existed here—the ancients had discovered that extreme cold could preserve more than bodies; it could preserve the doorways between worlds. <words>347</words>

As his warmth drained away and the child-spirit solidified in his embrace, Mordecai realized his purposefully aimless wandering had been following her ethereal footsteps all along. <words>372</words> The greenhouse shattered in silence, its tropical sanctuary surrendering to arctic truth, while he crossed through mirror-silver fragments into the uncharted frontier he'd sought. <words>397</words> Behind him, only the coffin fragment remained, waiting amid ice-claimed ferns for the next seeker to unravel its riddle. <words>416</words>
