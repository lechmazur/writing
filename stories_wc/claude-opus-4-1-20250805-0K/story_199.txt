Ranger Mika's badge gleamed against her pressed uniform as she patrolled the Skybridge Orchard, where apple trees grew from the bones of Interstate 405. <words>20</words> Three years after the last human dream flickered out—when humanity's collective unconscious finally went dark—she still enforced park regulations with religious fervor. <words>42</words>

The plain notebook in her breast pocket contained her grandmother's entries, written in a script that looked familiarly unknown, like reading your own handwriting underwater. <words>67</words> Each morning, the words would fluctuate between languages she'd never learned, revealing fragments: "The goddess walks when no one dreams to see her." <words>90</words>

Mika's rounds followed precise chaos—seventeen steps north, pause at the persimmon grove, thirty-two steps west, document the morning glories strangling the old exit signs. <words>114</words> This chaotic organization wasn't madness but method, a pattern her grandmother had hidden in shopping lists and birthday cards, only visible now in the dreamless world. <words>140</words>

Through chance encounters with other visitors, she'd learned she wasn't alone in her search. <words>154</words> The vendor selling honey mentioned hearing whispers in the abandoned HOV lanes below. <words>167</words> The jogger who ran backwards claimed the goddess left footprints in the morning dew. <words>182</words> Each testimony added another coordinate to Mika's mental map. <words>191</words>

"You're too rigid," her supervisor had warned, watching Mika measure the distance between apple trees with military precision. <words>209</words> But Mika understood what he didn't—in a world without dreams, only obsessive documentation could catch divinity's echo. <words>227</words>

The notebook's latest transformation revealed her grandmother's true purpose. <words>236</words> She'd been the last Keeper, tasked with preparing a vessel for the goddess when humanity's dreaming ended. <words>254</words> The orchard itself was the trap, each tree planted according to sacred geometry, the highway's concrete blessed with rituals disguised as construction work. <words>278</words>

Today, Mika noticed the anomaly during her third circuit. <words>287</words> Seven apples had fallen in a perfect circle, their stems pointing inward like clock hands. <words>303</words> The air inside the circle shimmered with something that wasn't quite heat. <words>316</words> She approached with her citation pad raised, ready to document the supernatural like a parking violation. <words>333</words>

The goddess materialized not as light or shadow, but as an absence that had presence, a familiar unknown that made Mika's eyes water. <words>357</words> "Your grandmother sent you," the voice came from everywhere and nowhere. <words>368</words> "She knew that when dreams died, only the overzealous would stay awake enough to notice." <words>384</words>

Mika opened the plain notebook, its pages now blank and waiting. <words>395</words> The goddess began to speak her true name, and Mika wrote, each letter a small rebellion against the dreamless dark, her pen catching echoes that would seed tomorrow's first new dream. <words>427</words>

She was, after all, her grandmother's granddaughter—obsessively devoted to preserving what others had forgotten to look for. <words>444</words>

In the urban orchard above the dead highway, divinity found its keeper. <words>456</words>
