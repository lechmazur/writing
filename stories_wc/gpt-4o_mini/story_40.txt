<story>In a forgotten recipe library, where dust motes danced in the shafts of light, a tentatively fierce goldfish caretaker named Clara rummaged through the shelves. <words>22</words> She had been reincarnated from a life of mundane office work, and now, her days were filled with the vibrant colors of aquatic life. <words>45</words> Yet, guilt’s haunting echo from her past lingered, a reminder of the goldfish she had neglected in her previous life. <words>70</words>
