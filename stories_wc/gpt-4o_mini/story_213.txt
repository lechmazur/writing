He raised the hair clip high, a symbol of the mundane transformed into something extraordinary. <words>373</words> “Let us destroy the doubts that bind us, and embrace the delightfully strange possibilities that lie ahead.” <words>396</words> With that, he let the hair clip fly, watching it arc through the air, a comet of hope. <words>419</words> It landed on the table with a soft thud, and laughter erupted, a wave of relief washing over the guests. <words>444</words>
