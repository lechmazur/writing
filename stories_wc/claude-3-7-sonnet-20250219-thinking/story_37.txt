Maya fidgeted in the doctor's waiting room, perched in a bamboo chair that swayed gently with the rainforest canopy village around it. <words>20</words> The crumpled sheet music in her pocket—a yodeling melody she'd stolen then legitimately purchased—felt like it was burning a hole through the fabric. <words>42</words> She'd arrived thirty minutes early, forced to take a lengthy detour around a construction zone where workers were reinforcing the suspension bridges between treehouses. <words>64</words>

"The Guardian Selection Committee will see you now," said the nurse, unaware she was addressing a woman who had once swindled half of Rio de Janeiro. <words>87</words>

Maya's reformation had been gradual, like the slow unfurling of a rainforest flower, each petal a revelation about who she could be beyond her clever schemes. <words>113</words> She stepped into the examination room where three elders sat behind a table laden with botanical instruments and the ceremonial lantern that would house tomorrow's flame—the rare phosphorescent orchid that bloomed once a century and required a dedicated guardian. <words>149</words>

"I understand you have credentials," said the eldest, a woman with eyes like amber pools. <words>164</words>

"I was the botanical curator at São Paulo University," Maya replied with her signature dishonestly honest smile—the facts true but the implications curated. <words>189</words> She had indeed been their curator, though only after forging enough paperwork to get hired. <words>205</words>

The second elder unrolled a scroll. <words>210</words> "And you can perform the Awakening Song?" <words>217</words>

Maya patted her pocket. <words>221</words> "I learned from Alpine shepherds during my... sabbatical." <words>230</words> She neglected to mention that her "sabbatical" had been a necessary escape after a diamond scheme went sideways. <words>248</words>

As questions continued, silent minutes stretched like vines between responses, each answer revealing more about the woman who had come to genuinely love the forest's mysteries. <words>273</words> When asked to demonstrate the song that would coax the orchid to bloom, Maya stood, unfolded her wrinkled sheet music, and began to yodel—the sound bouncing off the wooden walls and into the misty canopy beyond. <words>306</words>

The elders exchanged glances as her voice transformed, climbing and falling like the very mountains where she'd learned this art while hiding from former associates. <words>330</words>

"Why do you wish to be the guardian?" asked the third elder after the last note faded. <words>346</words>

Maya looked at the empty lantern. <words>352</words> "Because some things deserve protection, not exploitation," she said, thinking of all she had once taken without appreciation. <words>371</words> "And because I understand what it means to be misjudged, to bloom in unexpected circumstances." <words>386</words>

The eldest smiled knowingly. <words>390</words> "Sometimes the best guardians are those who once would have been thieves." <words>403</words>

Maya felt a weight lift as she realized they had known all along—her past, her detours, her earnest transformation—and still, they were considering her for this sacred trust. <words>436</words>
