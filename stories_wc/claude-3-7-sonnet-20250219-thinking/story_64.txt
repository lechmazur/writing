Elias pressed the cracked scale against his palm as the floating marketplace's courthouse swayed gently, its tethers to dozens of hot air balloons creaking in the morning breeze. <words>27</words> The uncertain alchemist had spent centuries developing formulas that were technically wild, defying conventional wisdom while producing results that the scientific community dismissed as impossible. <words>50</words> Yet here he stood trial, not for his unorthodox methods, but for the most precious secret he'd sworn to safeguard—the price of immortality. <words>71</words>

The courtroom fell silent, that peculiar hush before the judge reads the verdict spreading like fog across the ancient marble floor. <words>90</words> Only Elias could see what others couldn't: the seemingly random scuffs and scratches across the centuries-old marble formed a pattern, a code left by other immortals who had stood trial here before. <words>120</words> To untrained eyes, they appeared as mere wear from countless floating journeys, but to him, they revealed escape routes, safe passages, warnings. <words>141</words>

His crime was simple: using his unending life to map the treacherous forest trails below, documenting paths that kingdoms preferred to keep mysterious and dangerous. <words>165</words> Knowledge meant freedom, and freedom threatened power. <words>172</words> The scale from the long-extinct Chronos Dragon had granted him eternity but taken his peace. <words>187</words>

Elias observed the mundane miracles surrounding him—the bailiff whose arthritic hands nonetheless perfectly balanced stacks of documents, the defense attorney whose whispered calculations predicted wind patterns that kept the marketplace aloft, the small birds that had evolved specifically to nest in floating societies. <words>224</words> How could they not see that immortality wasn't the gift they imagined but a sentence of watching every wonder become ordinary? <words>244</words>

He traced one particular scuff with his toe—three short, one long, two short—a message from another immortal from two centuries past. <words>266</words> Freedom lies in surrender, it suggested. <words>272</words>

The judge cleared his throat, drawing Elias back to the present moment. <words>283</words> "For the crime of mapping protected territories and distributing forbidden knowledge, this court finds the defendant..." <words>299</words>

Elias closed his fingers around the scale, feeling its familiar warmth. <words>310</words> Five hundred years of carrying this burden, and now he understood what the coded floor truly revealed—not an escape route, but a choice. <words>332</words>

He could slip away through the pattern of coordinates scratched into the marble, or he could finally let go. <words>351</words> The judge's words faded as Elias made his decision, carefully placing the cracked scale on the floor where it belonged, completing a constellation of scuffs that had waited centuries for this final piece. <words>384</words>

Perhaps mortality was the most mundane miracle of all, he thought, as the scale began to dissolve into the marble, taking with it the burden of endless tomorrows. <words>412</words> The floating marketplace would continue its journey without him, and below, the forest trails he'd mapped would guide others to discover their own wonders, their own stories bound beautifully by beginnings and ends. <words>443</words>
