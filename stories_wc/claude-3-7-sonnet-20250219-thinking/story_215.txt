Father Thomas Reeves clutched the vintage postcard in his trembling hands, his years of exorcising demons suddenly insufficient preparation for what awaited him at the Blackwood Institute for Paranormal Studies. <words>27</words>

The rattled exorcist had received the mysterious postal relic three days prior, its faded image of the Victorian-era facility overlaid with peculiar markings that he'd spent sleepless nights decoding. <words>53</words>

"Your timing is impeccable, Father," Dr. Eleanor Wells remarked with a smile that didn't reach her eyes, her voice a silken blend of invitation and warning as she led him through the research facility's west wing. <words>81</words>

"Our Tuesday afternoon dance lessons provide excellent cover for your... investigation," she added, gesturing toward a large hall where researchers awkwardly waltzed in pairs, electrodes subtly attached to their temples. <words>111</words>

Though Thomas presented a solitary figure in his clerical attire, he was inwardly social, analyzing each interaction and cataloging potential allies among the scientific staff with whom he exchanged knowing glances. <words>139</words>

"The phenomena manifested exactly as your letter described," he said, matching Dr. Wells' coy aggression with his own carefully measured revelations, "but I believe what you've captured is not supernatural but rather a synthesis of quantum entanglement and residual psychic imprinting." <words>176</words>

Dr. Wells' eyebrow arched delicately as she guided him past swaying couples toward a locked door. <words>190</words>

"The first puzzle is there," she whispered, nodding toward a seemingly ordinary thermostat whose temperature settings corresponded to symbols on his postcard. <words>210</words>

Over the next hour, amid the rhythmic counting of dance instructors and the shuffling of feet, Thomas moved through the facility solving increasingly complex puzzles – a bookshelf sequence, a pattern of light switches, a specific arrangement of laboratory beakers – each solution revealed through guarded disclosures between himself and selected researchers. <words>255</words>

His clerical training had taught him patience, but his hands still shook when the final puzzle – a perfect reproduction of the dance pattern illustrated microscopically on his postcard – caused a hidden panel to slide open in the observation room. <words>290</words>

Inside, holographic displays showed what Thomas had theorized but never proven: the measurable energy patterns of human consciousness surviving bodily death, scientifically documented and repeatable. <words>315</words>

"This is why I contacted you specifically," Dr. Wells admitted, her aggressive facade softening slightly. <words>328</words>

"Your unique background allows you to synthesize theological understanding with our empirical findings." <words>341</words>

Thomas moved reverently among the equipment, his life's mission to entwine science with wonder finally materializing before him. <words>359</words>

"We've been able to measure it, Father Reeves," Dr. Wells said, "but we need someone who can speak to it." <words>378</words>

The exorcist smiled, placing the vintage postcard on the central console where it belonged, completing a circuit that illuminated the chamber with spectral light. <words>400</words>

"Then let us dance with your ghosts, Doctor," he replied, finally stilling his trembling hands as the barrier between worlds thinned around them, "and may they be willing to share their secrets." <words>432</words>
