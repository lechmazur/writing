The unsteady sentinel, Kariv, swayed at his post in the abandoned space freighter docking bay, his gaze fixed on the strange automaton bird that had appeared the moment the dimensional rifts began opening. <words>27</words> Its brass wings caught the dying light of twin suns as cosmic debris from the colliding worlds scattered across the void beyond the bay's atmospheric shield. <words>50</words> The bird tilted its mechanical head, eyes glowing with an intelligence that seemed to pierce through the sentinel's dwindling resolve. <words>69</words> Kariv had been stationed here for decades, forgotten by the fleet, his only purpose to guard the bay against intruders who never came—until now, when the very fabric of reality was tearing at the seams. <words>102</words> The automaton bird chirped a sequence of metallic notes before dropping a scrap of paper at his feet, then fluttered to a nearby console where dozens more scraps lay scattered. <words>129</words> With trembling hands, Kariv began to gather the fragments, recognizing them as pieces of the letters he'd written to himself over the years—letters he'd later destroyed in fits of coyly furious despair when no rescue ever came. <words>167</words> As the walls of the docking bay groaned under the strain of converging gravitational forces, he meticulously reassembled the shredded letters on the floor, forming a message that he had unwittingly written to himself across time. <words>201</words> The bird watched with its unblinking gaze as Kariv's face transformed from confusion to a strange, cheerless ecstasy as the prophecy—the one that had condemned him to this solitary post—revealed itself to be not a mandate from his superiors but a desperate plea from his future self. <words>249</words> The prophecy had foretold that only the sentinel's vigil could prevent catastrophe when the worlds collided, but the reassembled text revealed a different truth: his presence here was meant to ensure the collision, a necessary reset for a dying multiverse. <words>292</words> The automaton bird, a messenger constructed by his own hands in a future that was now becoming past, spread its wings and recommended in a voice eerily similar to Kariv's own, "Let the worlds merge as they must; your duty is not to prevent but to witness." <words>335</words> The fog of the misguided prophecy began to clear as Kariv realized he had never been abandoned here by accident; he had been positioned at the exact coordinates where the dimensional breach would first occur, a calculated placement by a version of himself that had already lived through this moment. <words>384</words> Outside, stars collapsed and galaxies folded into each other with impossible beauty, the ambush of fate unfolding in cosmic scale as Kariv opened the bay doors, no longer resisting what he now understood to be inevitable and necessary. <words>421</words> The sentinel stood steadier now, his purpose clarified, as the automaton bird perched on his shoulder and together they faced the brilliant chaos of rebirth, their silhouettes sharp against the kaleidoscope of destruction and creation. <words>454</words> In that moment, as the old universe died and a new one formed, Kariv found peace knowing his vigilance had not been in vain—he had fulfilled his true duty, not as a guardian against change, but as its shepherd. <words>491</words>
