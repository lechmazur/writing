Thom wiped down the tavern counter, flicking amber droplets from his calloused hands with practiced indifference. <words>14</words>

His life had been predictably unpredictable—fired from twelve taverns in as many months, yet always landing on his feet with that roguish charm that patrons found either endearing or insufferable. <words>43</words>

The broken collection of seashells jingled in his pocket, fragments he'd gathered since childhood, each carrying whispers he'd spent decades pretending not to hear. <words>66</words>

"Time's running short," muttered Old Maevis as she slid her empty mug forward, her eyes reflecting knowledge of things Thom desperately wanted to ignore. <words>88</words>

"It always is," he replied with flippant solemnity, though the tremor in his fingers betrayed his façade. <words>104</words>

That night, the shells pulled him from his pallet bed behind the tavern, their broken edges glowing with impossible light as the moon dimmed and stars rewound their paths across the sky. <words>135</words>

He followed their call to the dried-up riverbed where ancient creatures had once tread, their fossilized footprints now forming a pattern only visible when the sands of time flowed backward. <words>163</words>

Each footprint filled momentarily with spectral water as Thom stepped into them, creating ripples that spread contrary to natural law. <words>180</words>

The final footprint opened beneath him, dropping him into the vacuum chamber garden—that impossible place where physics bent reluctantly to imagination's will. <words>200</words>

Plants of glass and light grew in geometric precision, each one containing universes in miniature, all sustained in vacuum-sealed domes that should have been scientifically impossible. <words>222</words>

"You're late," said the Gardener, neither young nor old, their form shifting between states of matter as they pruned a constellation shrub. <words>242</words>

"I was busy," Thom said, though they both recognized the lie in his voice. <words>254</words>

The Gardener handed him the Randomizer—a device like an astrolabe made from the same material as his broken shells—and gestured toward the withering sections of the garden. <words>279</words>

"The patterns grow too static," they explained. <words>285</words>

Thom sighed, accepting his inescapable calling with the reluctant grace of one who has run too long. <words>301</words>

He moved through the garden, adjusting the Randomizer at each junction where realities overlapped, introducing chaos where order had calcified, following instincts he'd inherited but never understood. <words>327</words>

Worlds within the vacuum domes blossomed with new possibilities as he worked, civilizations evolving along fresh trajectories, imagination catapulted beyond known realms. <words>347</words>

"You could have told me sooner," Thom muttered to his shells as he worked, "instead of letting me play tavern-hand for thirty years." <words>370</words>

The shells only chimed in response, their broken edges perfectly aligned with the fractures between dimensions. <words>385</words>

When the work was done, Thom stood at the garden's center, watching time's sands reversing in the hourglasses that hung like fruit from crystalline trees. <words>407</words>

He realized then that his scrappy existence—his ability to adapt, to survive, to find order in chaos—had been preparation all along. <words>428</words>

With a newfound respect for his peculiar destiny, Thom pocketed his shells and prepared for the next cycle, knowing he would return to the tavern with renewed purpose until the garden called again. <words>457</words>

After all, someone had to keep the multiverse properly unpredictable, and who better than a tavern-hand who knew exactly how much randomness each reality could handle before it spilled over? <words>486</words>
