Mortimer had spent decades tending to the forgotten dead, his weathered hands and permanent scowl as much a fixture of the cemetery as the moss-covered angels. <words>19</words>

The unmarked cardboard tube he clutched had arrived mysteriously that morning, containing the ashes of his twin brother—the source of his most profound trauma and the reason he had chosen a life among the silent dead. <words>33</words>

His nightmares had grown worse, memories multiply singular in their repetition yet uniquely painful each time they surfaced in his consciousness. <words>19</words>

The witch Elara had sent word that tonight, during the annual celestial alignment, she could help him find peace if he was brave enough to seek it. <words>24</words>

Mortimer entered Elara's crystal scrying room as twilight deepened into night, the ceiling enchanted to reveal the cosmos above while dozens of crystals caught and amplified the starlight. <words>27</words>

"Your pain has created an uprising within you," Elara whispered, her fingers tracing the rim of a large crystal bowl as she gestured for him to sit before an intricate sand mandala that took up most of the floor. <words>34</words>

She instructed him to place the tube at the mandala's center and to jiggle it gently until the ashes began to spill in a thin stream onto the colored sands. <words>28</words>

As Mortimer watched, the ashes seemed to dance through the patterns in the sand mandala, tracing channels and pooling in symbolic hollows that somehow corresponded to moments in his life. <words>29</words>

Throughout their stargazing, as constellations slowly wheeled overhead, Elara guided him to see how his brother's death—though tragic—had shaped him into the person he had become. <words>25</words>

"The importance of trauma lies not in its power to destroy, but in its potential to transform," she said, her voice neither dramatic nor plain, carrying a grandiose subtlety that reached into Mortimer's very bones. <words>36</words>

Tears fell from the caretaker's eyes, each droplet disturbing the sand patterns, creating new configurations that seemed to release rather than erase the past. <words>22</words>

The mandala began to glow softly under the starlight, and Mortimer felt the decades of anger subsiding, like a tide going out, leaving behind a shore renewed. <words>27</words>

By dawn, the uprising within had been quelled, not through forgetting but through understanding the singular events that had multiplied into a lifetime of bitterness. <words>24</words>

Mortimer left the witch's chamber with empty hands—the tube and ashes now one with the mandala—but with a heart unexpectedly full. <words>21</words>

He returned to his crypt, still a caretaker, still somewhat grumpy by nature, but no longer haunted by what he couldn't change. <words>21</words>

For the first time in memory, he welcomed the morning light filtering through the cemetery's ancient oaks, casting patterns reminiscent of the mandala upon the gravestones he had tended so meticulously. <words>28</words>

Perhaps now he could be more than a keeper of others' remains; perhaps he too could live fully in the present moment rather than being buried in his past. <words>26</words>
