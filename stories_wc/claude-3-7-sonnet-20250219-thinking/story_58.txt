Marcus stood at his post in the moth observation tower, binoculars trained on the massive Atlas moths that fluttered against the twilight sky. <words>19</words>

The city below him convulsed in darkness as the lights flickered and died, an unexpected outage that sent ripples of shadow across the urban landscape. <words>41</words>

His fingers traced the intricate engravings on his bullet journal cover—constellations and lunar phases etched into leather—a gift from his commander and a reminder of his mission to document not just moth migration patterns but his progress in meditation techniques. <words>74</words>

The training manuals claimed meditation would help scouts like him balance the inside storms that came with isolation duty, the whirlwinds of loneliness and paranoia that had consumed his predecessors. <words>101</words>

When the stranger arrived, climbing the tower's spiral staircase with a duffel bag and a smile too wide for comfort, Marcus's loyalty wavered between protocol and curiosity. <words>126</words>

"I perform for the research team on Thursdays," the visitor explained, setting up a small microphone stand, his movements precise yet individually common—nothing remarkable until you noticed the pattern. <words>152</words>

The comedy routine began benignly enough, jokes about moth mating habits and scientist stereotypes, but Marcus's trained ear caught the nonsense phrases repeated at measured intervals. <words>176</words>

"When the dusty wings meet moonlight," the comedian said between punchlines, "even the silent observers must choose their allegiance." <words>193</words>

A sanctified dread crept up Marcus's spine as he recognized the coded activation phrases—the same ones mentioned in security briefings, designed to radicalize isolated outpost personnel. <words>219</words>

The moths outside beat harder against the glass, their wings creating a percussion that seemed to sync with the comedian's cadence. <words>239</words>

Each joke landed like the tolling of a distant bell, calling the faithful to worship, calling Marcus to betray everything he'd sworn to protect. <words>261</words>

He opened his bullet journal, pretending to take notes while actually reviewing the centering mantras his meditation instructor had insisted would anchor him during moments of moral crisis. <words>288</words>

The city's lights sputtered back momentarily, illuminating the comedian's eyes—reflective, inhuman—before darkness reclaimed the skyline. <words>306</words>

"You feel it, don't you?" the stranger whispered, no longer performing, "The pull toward something greater than yourself, greater than your tedious loyalty?" <words>328</words>

Marcus closed his journal, stood up, and in the practiced calm voice of someone who had finally balanced his inside storms, said, "I've been expecting your kind for months—that's why they stationed me here." <words>362</words>

The moth observation tower had never been about lepidoptera research at all, but rather about watching for those who would spread their ideology like spores in the dark, radicalize the gatekeepers, and Marcus—the fiercely loyal scout—had just completed his real mission by identifying another infiltrator. <words>413</words>
