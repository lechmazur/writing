Fern clutched her dented lunch tin to her chest as she locked up the hologram repair shop, the weight of her grandfather's last gift a constant reminder of her obligations to continue the family's druidic traditions. <words>32</words> The irony wasn't lost on her that she spent her days fixing artificial nature while her own abilities to commune with real plants remained frustratingly uncertain. <words>56</words> Her magic was uniquely common—she could coax ferns and houseplants into flourishing but nothing exotic or impressive like the elder druids in her circle. <words>78</words>

Every day throughout library hours—her arbitrary window of freedom before the evening rush of repair orders—Fern would wander the city's forgotten corners. <words>98</words> Today, she pushed through a rusted door marked only by a faded theatrical mask, joining the shuffling line of hopefuls at another back-alley theater audition. <words>121</words> She had no intention of performing; these gatherings were merely her research. <words>132</words>

"Next," called the director with the mechanical enthusiasm of someone who had seen too much mediocrity. <words>145</words> Fern observed from the shadows, studying how emotions moved through bodies, how light caught on gestures—details she would later incorporate into her holograms. <words>167</words>

Her fingers traced the lunch tin's dents, each one a memory of her grandfather who had taught her that true druidic power came not from grand displays but from patient observation. <words>194</words> Inside the tin nestled seeds and small crystals—materials she'd infuse with both technology and her modest magic. <words>210</words>

Back at the shop, surrounded by broken projectors and fragmented light displays, Fern felt a lethargic excitement bubbling beneath her exhaustion. <words>228</words> Each hologram she repaired received something extra—a flutter of leaf movement no programming could replicate, a subtle pattern of growth that seemed to respond to viewers' presence. <words>252</words> Customers never noticed consciously, but they returned again and again, drawn to something they couldn't name. <words>268</words>

Her supervisor approved of her high customer satisfaction ratings without understanding why her repairs outperformed others. <words>283</words> What looked like technical precision was actually Fern's quiet rebellion, her way of forging beauty from the anarchy of broken machinery and discarded fantasies. <words>304</words>

That evening, as the library across the street switched off its lights, Fern completed her masterpiece—a holographic forest installation commissioned for the city center. <words>327</words> Her magic, uncertain as it was, had woven itself into the projection, ensuring that no two viewings would ever be identical. <words>346</words> Tomorrow, thousands would walk through her creation, experiencing a wild natural space that had never actually existed. <words>363</words>

Fern placed her grandfather's tin on the workbench and whispered her gratitude to him, to the theater performers who'd never know they'd been her teachers, to the broken machines that surrendered their chaos to her vision. <words>393</words> In a world where nature had become precious and rare, her uniquely common gift had found its purpose—merging technology and ancient druidic ways to create something neither wholly artificial nor entirely natural, but undeniably alive. <words>426</words>
