Mason fled inland, away from the life that had hollowed him, each mile distancing him from coastal disappointments and drawing him deeper into unfamiliar terrain. <words>21</words>

The abandoned carnival emerged from the twilight mist like a memory he'd never owned, its weathered structures promising the anonymity he craved after three years of small-town suffocation. <words>43</words>

He approached the house of mirrors, its faded façade oddly welcoming, unlike the pitying glances that had followed him through streets where everyone knew his heartbreak. <words>64</words>

Inside, warped reflections greeted him—dozens of distorted Masons with eyes that had forgotten how to hope. <words>77</words>

A stained glass panel hung incongruously near the center of the labyrinth, its colors muted beneath years of dust and cobwebs. <words>96</words>

Mason had chosen this place intentionally, though he would tell himself later it was accidental—this calculated stumbling into abandoned places where his thoughts might finally quiet. <words>119</words>

Outside, a metal sign swung in the persistent coastal wind, tapping rhythmically against the wooden structure in a Morse code without meaning. <words>138</words>

That tapping—gentle, then insistent—vibrated through the floor and walls, dislodging ancient dust that danced in the thin shafts of dying sunlight. <words>158</words>

The dust particles swirled around the stained glass, catching light and transforming into what Mason could only describe as a cradle of sparks—tiny constellations suspended in the stale carnival air. <words>184</words>

He stood mesmerized as the sparks multiplied with each tap of the sign, as if the sound waves themselves could fertilize light. <words>203</words>

His reflection—no longer distorted but multiplied infinitely in the surrounding mirrors—watched the phenomenon with an expression Mason hadn't worn in years: wonder. <words>224</words>

In this moment of hammered repose, beaten down by life yet finding unexpected peace, Mason recognized something awakening within him. <words>242</words>

The cradle of sparks expanded, illuminating corners of his mind that had been dark for too long—corners where possibilities still lived, waiting. <words>265</words>

He thought of Eliza then, how she'd tried to reach these same corners before he'd shut down completely. <words>282</words>

The phone in his pocket seemed suddenly heavy with her unanswered messages, each one an attempt to navigate the maze he'd become. <words>303</words>

As darkness settled outside, the sparks grew brighter, casting prism-patterns across his upturned face like tears he'd refused to shed. <words>323</words>

He pulled out his phone, the screen's glow joining the constellation around him. <words>336</words>

She answered on the first ring, as if she'd been waiting by the phone, waiting for him to emerge from his mental labyrinth. <words>357</words>

"I found this place," he said, voice cracking from disuse, "where light does impossible things." <words>371</words>

"Tell me," she whispered, and he could hear in those two words that she was offering him another chance. <words>387</words>

Mason described the carnival, the mirrors, the stained glass birthing light from nothing—metaphors tumbling out for everything he'd been unable to express. <words>407</words>

In the pause that followed, the metal sign tapped once more against the building, a final punctuation. <words>423</words>

The line between them hummed with possibility in the hush before Eliza finally said, "I love you, still," words that fertilized the dormant soil of his heart. <words>447</words>

"I'm coming home," Mason replied, watching his countless reflections nod in agreement as the cradle of sparks began to fade, having served its purpose in lighting his way back. <words>474</words>
