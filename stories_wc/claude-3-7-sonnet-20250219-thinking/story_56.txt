Maxwell Thorne moved with energetically lethargic purpose through the rows of apple trees sprouting from the fifty-third floor of what was once the Meridian Tower. <words>21</words> The bluffing swindler had perfected his exhausted-yet-enthusiastic persona, finding it disarmed potential marks who mistook his contradiction for authenticity. <words>38</words> Afternoon light filtered through the shattered windows, illuminating the peculiar ecosystem where fallen concrete met fertile soil, nature reclaiming what humanity had abandoned. <words>57</words> His fingers traced the blank price tag dangling from a particularly robust tree—his calling card, his silent promise that everything valuable eventually becomes worthless, or priceless, depending on who was buying. <words>81</words>

"The harvest looks promising," he announced to the seemingly empty orchard, knowing his invisible allies—the displaced spirits of the tower's former occupants—were listening, as they always did. <words>106</words> They couldn't materialize, but they could magnetize objects, a peculiar afterlife ability that had proven remarkably useful in Maxwell's elaborate schemes. <words>125</words> He removed his ancient laptop from his bag, the one that froze more often than it functioned, and placed it on a makeshift desk of stacked debris. <words>148</words>

The computer had crashed mid-transaction, leaving his latest mark in limbo, waiting for confirmation of funds that would never truly exist. <words>168</words> As Maxwell watched the loading symbol spin, something within him spun too—a growing weariness with the person he had become. <words>187</words>

The exact moment the computer screen flickered back to life, his trembling hands dropped the leather-bound book of accounts he'd been nervously thumbing. <words>209</words> It slid across the uneven floor, coming to rest at the feet of a woman he hadn't noticed enter—Dr. Eleanor Voss, botanical researcher, whose quiet footsteps had been masked by the orchard's ambient sounds. <words>240</words>

"Interesting reading material for a supposed agricultural consultant," she said, picking up the book of fraudulent identities and fabricated credentials, her tone carrying gentle harshness like a velvet-wrapped stone. <words>263</words>

Maxwell felt the familiar rush to fabricate, to charm, to bluff—but found himself paralyzed by her unwavering gaze. <words>280</words> Instead of lies, something altogether foreign emerged: "I've been cataloging the ghosts," he said softly. <words>293</words>

"Ghosts don't exist," she replied, even as a blank price tag nearby swayed against the stillness of the air. <words>310</words>

"They do," Maxwell insisted, "and they're trying to tell us something about what really happened here, about the tower's collapse." <words>330</words> The truth he'd discovered through his spectral companions—corporate negligence hidden behind falsified inspection reports—was one no developer, no city official, no survivor wanted exposed. <words>354</words>

Eleanor's skeptical expression softened as loose soil around them began to arrange itself into unmistakable words. <words>370</words> The spirits were tired of being invisible, of being deniable. <words>380</words>

"I came here to study resilient ecosystems," Eleanor whispered, "not to exhume buried truths." <words>394</words>

"Yet here we are," Maxwell replied, watching as his computer screen filled with long-deleted documents the ghosts had somehow preserved, "standing exactly where truth and nature intersect." <words>419</words>
