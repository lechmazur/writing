General Martinez slumped into the corner booth of the Dark Matter Diner, his medals weighing heavy on his chest. <words>16</words>

The peculiar establishment sat suspended in the void between shuttle rides to Mars, a waypoint for travelers seeking sustenance and strange company. <words>37</words>

He'd been fighting wars across three planets for fifteen years, and now his soul felt as depleted as the coffee in his chipped mug. <words>59</words>

"You look like you've seen the end of the universe," came a voice from across the table, belonging to an elderly woman with twinkling eyes who slid a package of dried seaweed toward him. <words>86</words>

"Soldiers need their minerals," she explained with a wink, "and their perspective." <words>97</words>

The general eyed the dark green strips suspiciously, then the woman, wondering how she knew his profession when he'd removed his uniform jacket. <words>118</words>

With a flourish that seemed almost practiced, she pointed to the wall lined with black-and-white photographs. <words>132</words>

"See those arcs of light? They're not just decoration—they're portals showing everyone who sits in that booth what they're most afraid of losing." <words>152</words>

Martinez squinted at the nearest photograph: a blurry image of himself, younger, laughing with fellow officers who now existed only in memory. <words>172</words>

"That's rationally absurd," he muttered, but couldn't explain why tears stung his eyes. <words>185</words>

The old woman chuckled. "The most absurd things are often the most rational, General—like how we all pretend we're not terrified of the same things." <words>210</words>

Other diners—a young cadet, a weather technician, a cargo pilot—glanced over with knowing looks that confirmed her words. <words>228</words>

"We come here between rides to remember what we're riding for," said the cadet, raising a glass of luminescent liquid. <words>247</words>

The general felt something shift inside him as he realized these strangers shared his anxieties about purpose, mortality, and the vast emptiness between stars. <words>271</words>

"Fear has been running your war room for too long," the old woman said, tapping her temple. "Time to stage a coup." <words>291</words>

Martinez took a bite of the dried seaweed—it tasted of ocean and earth and things he'd forgotten to value. <words>309</words>

The photographs on the wall seemed to pulse, the arcs within them bending toward him like beckoning fingers. <words>326</words>

As he stared, the images began to change, showing not what was lost but what could yet be: hands clasped in forgiveness, gardens grown in craters, laughter echoing in places once silent. <words>356</words>

"Those pictures develop what you bring to them," explained the woman with mischievous wisdom. "They renew what's been burnt out." <words>375</words>

The general stood, feeling lighter than he had in years, and placed one of his medals on the table. <words>393</words>

"For my booth," he said, "so the next burnt soul can see there's a way forward." <words>409</words>

Later, as his shuttle prepared for departure, Martinez looked out at the stars with clear eyes, having dethroned fear from its long reign over his reason. <words>434</words>

And in the Dark Matter Diner, among the black-and-white photographs, a new image appeared—a general with a straight back, walking toward tomorrow instead of away from yesterday. <words>463</words>

He would return someday, between rides, to share seaweed and anxieties with fellow travelers navigating the rationally absurd journey of being human amid the cosmos. <words>490</words>
