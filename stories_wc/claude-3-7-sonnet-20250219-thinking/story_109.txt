Sir Aldric, a cold-natured knight serving in the clandestine division of National Security, stood motionless in the shadows at a deserted intersection. <words>20</words> His reputation for emotional distance had earned him the code name "Frost," yet beneath his armored exterior stirred an unacknowledged sensitivity to beauty and meaning. <words>41</words> The secret agent center had dispatched him to this location based on peculiar patterns of nocturnal gatherings, but at half-past midnight, only silence accompanied him. <words>64</words> Then, a small splash of red caught his eye—a child's lost mitten abandoned on the asphalt, its wool fibers catching moonlight like bloodied snow. <words>86</words>

Aldric retrieved the mitten, turning it over in his gloved hands, strangely moved by its tiny thumb and the embroidered initials. <words>105</words> As he studied it, headlights approached, then disappeared down an alley where a door opened briefly, illuminating a curious assemblage of people entering a basement. <words>128</words> Following his training while heeding his instincts, Aldric approached lawfully but rebelliously—obeying protocol while pursuing his own curiosity about this gathering. <words>146</words>

Inside, the basement had been transformed into a makeshift gallery where incomplete family altars stood—each missing essential pieces, deliberately left unfinished. <words>166</words> These weren't the terrorist cells his agency suspected, but civilians who had lost loved ones to incurable diseases, gathering to support each other through art and shared grief. <words>191</words> Around each altar, handwritten cards detailed folk remedies passed through generations—tinctures, poultices, and rituals meant to heal both body and spirit. <words>212</words>

"We collect them," explained an elderly woman who noticed his fascination, "not just for curing ailments, but to preserve what corporate medicine dismisses." <words>233</words> Aldric's fingers traced the pattern on the child's mitten, suddenly understanding his presence here wasn't coincidental but necessary. <words>250</words> The missing elements in each altar invited viewers to complete the narrative, to participate in healing through creative contribution. <words>269</words>

Something awakened in Aldric that night—an artistic sensibility long suppressed by years of tactical training and emotional armor. <words>286</words> Over subsequent weeks, he returned as himself, not as an agent, bringing the mitten and helping to establish a legitimate foundation that documented folk remedies while supporting grieving families. <words>315</words> His superiors, initially suspicious, eventually recognized the intelligence value of a community network built on trust rather than surveillance. <words>333</words>

Aldric's first altar remained deliberately incomplete—featuring only the red mitten on a small pedestal with space beside it—waiting. <words>352</words> Six months later, a small boy approached during an exhibition, wide-eyed with recognition. <words>366</words> "That's my sister's," he whispered, placing its matching pair beside it, completing what Aldric had begun. <words>383</words>

In the hush of his apartment that night, Aldric realized how the rigid boundaries between duty and compassion had dissolved. <words>401</words> The knight who once embodied cold calculation now understood that his most valuable service came not from perfect protocol but from the messy, incomplete work of human connection. <words>428</words> His reports, once clinical, now captured the close distance between observer and observed—the intimate space where healing truly happens. <words>448</words>
