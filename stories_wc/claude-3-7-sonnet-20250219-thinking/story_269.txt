Elliot Pierce polished brass buttons on a waistcoat while gazing through the curved glass windows of New London's highest observation deck, remembering simpler days before everything changed. <words>25</words> The ancient tailor's fingers, nimble despite their age, traced patterns he'd stitched thousands of times across fifty years of service to the airship elite. <words>45</words> Since the Cryptographers' Guild had broken the final atmospheric cipher three months ago, revealing the terrible truth that parallel worlds existed just beyond our perception, Elliot had scarcely slept. <words>69</words>

He moved toward the dusty mirror he'd discovered behind maintenance panels, its ornate frame seemingly growing more intricate each time he looked at it. <words>91</words> "Show me again," he whispered, his reflection wavering like heat distortion before revealing another Elliot—happier, younger—commanding respect in grand halls rather than quietly hemming trousers in shadows. <words>116</words> Something subtly menacing lingered in the other Elliot's smile, a hunger that both frightened and enticed him. <words>132</words>

Thunder rattled the copper-riveted deck as another storm approached, the massive lightning rods extending automatically from the platform's edge. <words>149</words> When the tempests came, the boundaries between worlds thinned, and confessions poured from Elliot like thread from a spool. <words>167</words>

"I see them all through this glass—versions of myself who made different choices," he told the young mechanic who'd come to check the pressure gauges, her eyes widening as lightning illuminated the deck. <words>195</words> "In one, I'm a celebrated inventor; in another, I rule nations with terrible machines of my design." <words>212</words>

"Sir, perhaps you should rest," she said, backing away slightly. <words>222</words>

"No, you must understand—these storms are keys!" Elliot insisted, his voice rising with the wind. <words>237</words> "When all possible worlds touch during electromagnetic convergence, one might slip between them." <words>249</words>

He pressed his weathered hand against the mirror, reassuring the frightened girl with surprising gentleness. <words>263</words> "Don't fear for me—I've calculated everything since the code revealed the multiverse's architecture." <words>277</words>

Lightning struck directly overhead, and Elliot's improbable confession tumbled forth: "I've sewn dimensional coordinates into every garment I've made for twenty years, preparing for this moment." <words>301</words>

The mechanic watched, transfixed, as Elliot faced his reflection with hopeful desperation etched across his lined face. <words>317</words> "Tonight, I ascend beyond flesh and stitch," he proclaimed as electricity danced across the observation deck's brass railings. <words>334</words>

When the storm reached its crescendo, the mirror's surface rippled like quicksilver, and Elliot—smiling with terrible certainty—stepped forward into it. <words>354</words> The glass flashed blindingly before settling back to normal, now showing only the mechanic's astonished reflection. <words>370</words>

On the floor lay Elliot's thimble beside a handwritten note: "We all wear different garments in different lives—I've simply decided to try on another." <words>394</words> Outside, the storm clouds parted, revealing stars that seemed, somehow, to be arranged in patterns resembling intricate stitches across the cosmos. <words>414</words>
