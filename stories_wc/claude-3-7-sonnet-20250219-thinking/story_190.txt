Felix had always considered himself a cautious smuggler, never taking unnecessary risks with his cargo of rare artifacts across borders. <words>17</words> The pressed butterfly in his pocket, trapped between thin glass sheets, had been his good luck charm for seven years of successful runs. <words>38</words> He tapped his fingers against his thigh in rhythm to the Chopin nocturne playing in his head, one of many musical memories that kept him company during long stakeouts. <words>64</words> Felix's approach to life was meticulously impulsive—he'd spend weeks planning every detail of a job, then completely reorganize his strategy minutes before execution based on intuition. <words>90</words>

Today's job at the Nevada Drought Prediction Center was unlike any other—he wasn't smuggling anything in, but rather information out. <words>110</words> He needed to predict the exact location of a forgotten masterpiece, information locked in the mind of renowned painter Anton Mercer, who was currently undergoing dental surgery in the building's medical wing. <words>139</words> Felix had learned that Mercer, through delirious confessions under anesthesia, had previously revealed coordinates to other hidden artworks. <words>156</words>

Dressed as a climate researcher, Felix monitored screens displaying rainfall patterns while keeping one eye on the hallway leading to the medical suite. <words>177</words> During the painter's confession, which the nurse had informed him would likely begin around 2:15 PM, Felix would need to be positioned in the adjacent supply closet. <words>203</words> He felt that familiar duality—meticulous in his planning while impulsively deciding to pick the lock now rather than during lunch hour as originally intended. <words>229</words>

His quest to become a master of empathy was what truly drove him; understanding how to read people had started as a survival skill but evolved into an obsession. <words>255</words> The butterfly in his pocket—once belonging to Mercer's deceased daughter—would serve as his connection to the painter's psyche. <words>273</words>

"Fascinating drought patterns we're seeing in the southwestern region," Felix commented to a passing researcher with enthusiastic apathy, his voice animated while his eyes remained coldly calculating. <words>295</words> The center's computers hummed around him as they processed climate data, providing perfect background noise for his scheme. <words>312</words>

When the time came, Felix slipped into the supply closet, pressed his ear against the thin wall, and heard Mercer's mumblings begin. <words>332</words> "The butterfly leads home... follow the music to the third measure... when rain falls on desert mountains..." the painter slurred while the dentist worked. <words>354</words> Felix transcribed every word, recognizing the musical reference to Bach's Goldberg Variations—the very piece Mercer had been composing variations of when his daughter died. <words>379</words>

As Felix departed, butterfly pressing against his chest pocket, he felt a rare genuine smile form—he had predicted Mercer's confession perfectly and now possessed both the artwork's location and something far more valuable: a true understanding of another's pain. <words>421</words>
