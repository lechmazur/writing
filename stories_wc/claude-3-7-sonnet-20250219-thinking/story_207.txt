Taro, a forthright peddler known across three galaxies for never hiding the flaws in his wares, hunched over ancient datapads in the abandoned space station's medical bay. <words>23</words> His fingers traced the edges of a dried flower bouquet—twelve desert lilies from his home planet, preserved in the vacuum of space for twenty-three years. <words>45</words> While most traders sought forgotten medicines or valuable equipment from the derelict station, Taro had come to sift through the rumor-laden gossip columns of the station's old crew newsletters, searching for mentions of Doctor Lienne Voss. <words>75</words> Outside, the universe hummed its secret song, cosmic radiation pinging against the hull in rhythms only the truly solitary could appreciate. <words>93</words> The doctor had saved Taro's life when he was a boy, extracting payment not in credits but in a blood oath—sworn on these very flowers—that he would never reveal her location to the Planetary Consortium. <words>125</words>

With a meekly assertive cough, Taro addressed the empty room, "I must break my promise to keep a greater one." <words>143</words> His voice, unused for weeks during his solitary journey, echoed against sterile walls that had witnessed countless healings and heartbreaks. <words>162</words> Methodically, he began to divide the information before him—sorting fact from fiction, official records from hearsay. <words>178</words> Articles mentioning Voss's revolutionary treatment protocols went into one stack, while those discussing her personal life formed another. <words>195</words> The third pile, smallest but most precious, contained hints about why she had fled—accusations of illegal genetic experimentation that Taro now knew had actually been attempts to save a doomed species. <words>225</words>

"The oath protected you when protection was needed," he murmured to the flowers, a smile forming despite his solitude. <words>243</words> There was joy in this loneliness, in being the only person in the vast emptiness of space who carried this truth. <words>263</words> As he worked, memories surfaced of the plague that had nearly taken his life, of Voss's gentle hands and determined eyes as she administered the unauthorized cure. <words>288</words>

Three station days later, Taro found what he sought—coordinates encrypted within a seemingly mundane gossip column about staff romances. <words>306</words> The doctor had left breadcrumbs, knowing someday someone might need to find her again. <words>321</words> With careful hands, he gathered his evidence and pressed the dried bouquet between the pages of his journal, his burden lighter despite the gravity of his decision. <words>346</words>

Redemption's path wasn't about keeping every promise, but knowing which ones needed breaking for the greater good. <words>363</words> The medical bay, once cold and forbidding, now seemed to glow with approval as Taro packed his findings. <words>381</words> Soon, he would return to the trade routes with his usual assortment of oddities and necessities, but first, he would find Doctor Voss and warn her that the Consortium had discovered her work—not as the betrayer his oath would make him, but as the ally she had always hoped he would become. <words>430</words>
