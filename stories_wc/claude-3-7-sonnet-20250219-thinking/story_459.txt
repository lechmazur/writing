Marcus fixed elevators by day and chased spirits by night, his tools clinking softly against his belt as he walked the halls of the Atlantic Science Center. <words>21</words>

The sand castle preservation lab on the third floor was where he found the most peace, surrounded by delicate structures protected behind climate-controlled glass. <words>42</words>

During his lunch breaks, he would sit among them, eating his sandwich amid perfect miniature turrets and moats preserved for posterity. <words>61</words>

It was here that the ghosts appeared most clearly—translucent figures wandering through walls, their movements leaving no impression upon the carefully maintained sand. <words>83</words>

In his left pocket, Marcus carried a dried flower crown, fashioned from lavender and daisies that his daughter had made before passing away last spring. <words>105</words>

The crown connected him to her, but also to the other side, allowing him to see those caught between worlds. <words>125</words>

Marcus was elegantly clumsy in his pursuit of understanding; he would trip over cords while gracefully catching falling tools, apologize profusely while somehow charming everyone around him. <words>149</words>

He had begun staking out local ghost tours, following guides who theatrically recounted manufactured hauntings while actual spirits hovered nearby, amused or offended by the inaccuracies. <words>173</words>

"The dissonance of silence," he wrote in his journal, "is how loudly absence speaks when you've known presence." <words>191</words>

Marcus had started to dissect his experiences methodically, recording each ghostly encounter with scientific precision while acknowledging the emotional weight they carried. <words>211</words>

The tour guides noticed the quiet man with tool-laden pockets who attended every session but never asked questions. <words>228</words>

Today, as sunlight filtered through the lab's windows, casting rainbow prisms across meticulously preserved sand battlements, a small ghost girl appeared beside the medieval castle exhibit. <words>250</words>

She wore no flower crown like the one in his pocket, but her smile was unmistakable. <words>265</words>

"Daddy," she whispered, the sound somehow both there and not there, "you don't need to understand everything to let me go." <words>284</words>

His breath caught as he unwrapped his sandwich, colleagues chatting at nearby tables unaware of the visitation occurring amid their lunch break conversations. <words>305</words>

Tears threatened, but for once, Marcus didn't reach for his notebook to document the encounter. <words>320</words>

Instead, he gently removed the dried flower crown from his pocket and placed it atop the display case. <words>337</words>

"I know, sweetheart," he replied, ignoring the curious glances from his coworkers who heard only half a conversation. <words>354</words>

His daughter's ghost smiled once more before dissolving into the air conditioning currents that preserved the fragile sand structures. <words>372</words>

In the resonant silence that followed, Marcus felt something release within him—not the scientific curiosity that had driven him to follow ghost tours and catalog spectral appearances, but the desperate grip of grief. <words>403</words>

That evening, when a phantom appeared beside him in the elevator shaft he was repairing, Marcus simply nodded acknowledgment and continued his work, finally understanding that liberation came not from holding on to what he knew, but from accepting what he couldn't know. <words>441</words>

Like the sand castles in their protective cases, some things weren't meant to be preserved forever but appreciated for the brief, beautiful moments they existed. <words>465</words>
