Dr. Moira Reed clutched the seashell to her chest, her fingers tracing the unusual symbol etched into its surface as she stood in the hush of a half-lit corridor. <words>29</words>

The outcast scholar had spent years tracking rumors of this place, following breadcrumbs of information pieced together via diaries hidden behind a tile in a public restroom near the university library. <words>58</words>

Though colleagues had shunned her theories on spiritual liminality, something about Moira's earnest dedication made her strangely trustworthy to those who guarded ancient secrets. <words>82</words>

She'd come to the witch's flying carpet garage—a massive, impossible space hidden beneath the ordinary facade of an abandoned warehouse—to prove that midnight only lasts so long. <words>113</words>

The diaries had spoken of a ritual that could break the eternal darkness spell cast upon her sister, who had been frozen in midnight's embrace for seven years. <words>142</words>

"You're right on time," came a voice from the shadows, causing Moira to jolt and nearly drop the precious shell. <words>161</words>

Madam Vesper, the garage's proprietor, emerged from between hovering carpets of various designs, their edges glimmering with enchantments that kept them aloft. <words>184</words>

"The seashell is the key," Madam Vesper said, gesturing toward an ornate rug suspended in the center of the garage, its patterns eerily similar to the symbol on the shell. <words>214</words>

Moira approached with deliberate steps, maintaining a frantic peace within herself—urgent purpose contained within practiced calm. <words>231</words>

"The ritual requires mirroring the soul," Vesper explained, positioning Moira on the carpet. <words>244</words>

"Your connection to your sister, the love you've maintained despite the curse—it will serve as the bridge between temporal realities." <words>266</words>

Moira placed the shell in the carpet's center, watching as it began to glow, creating a pool of light that reflected not her physical form but the essence of her being—her fears, hopes, and unwavering determination. <words>308</words>

The carpet rose slowly from the floor as Moira closed her eyes, feeling the boundaries between midnight and dawn begin to blur. <words>330</words>

Around them, the garage's vast collection of enchanted rugs shimmered in sympathetic resonance, creating a tapestry of light that pushed back against the darkness. <words>357</words>

When the clock somewhere in the distance struck twelve, the seashell pulsed with brilliant light, its strange symbol projecting outward in all directions. <words>381</words>

Time seemed to pause as the shell's power expanded, the witch's flying carpets circling them like constellations around a newborn star. <words>402</words>

Moira held her breath as the midnight hour stretched and thinned, becoming permeable, vulnerable to change. <words>419</words>

"Now," whispered Vesper, her eyes reflecting the shell's light. <words>428</words>

With trembling hands, Moira completed the ritual, watching as the shell cracked open to reveal not emptiness but a small flame that danced with the same rhythm as her heartbeat. <words>457</words>

As the flame leaped from the broken shell to merge with her reflected soul, Moira knew her sister would be waking now, freed from midnight's grasp—proof that even the darkest hour eventually surrenders to light. <words>496</words>
