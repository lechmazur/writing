Alistair Chen followed the map sketched on frost-covered car windows, his weathered hands tracing the familiar puzzle of crystalline patterns. <words>17</words> As a wandering fireworks designer, he had learned to see meaning in ephemeral beauty, in the brief explosions that illuminated night skies before fading to memory. <words>39</words> The patterns had appeared three consecutive mornings on his windshield, too precise to be coincidental, forming what he recognized as topographical lines of the nearby mountains. <words>61</words>

The coordinates led him to a thundering waterfall, where spray misted his collection of pressed leaves—specimens gathered from every place his nomadic career had taken him. <words>86</words> "Theoretically creative," his university professors had always called him, dismissing his unconventional ideas with academic disdain that eventually drove him from academia to pyrotechnics. <words>110</words>

Standing before the roaring curtain of water, Alistair aligned a particular maple leaf against the cascading sheet, watching how the veins seemed to augment the flow, revealing subtle undulations in the water's pattern. <words>141</words> He stepped forward, bracing for cold immersion, but instead found himself in a cavernous space, dry and warm, lined with ancient wooden shelves sagging under the weight of countless volumes. <words>170</words>

Within this hidden library, time felt negotiable, the ephemeral nature of moments stretched like taffy in the amber light filtering through the water walls. <words>193</words> An elderly librarian approached, her eyes reflecting recognition though they'd never met. <words>204</words> "You've finally arrived to correct your life's regret," she said, handing him a book bound in leather the color of autumn. <words>223</words>

Inside were pressed leaves—copies of his own collection—but arranged differently, forming equations, formulas, designs. <words>238</words> Alistair recognized these configurations as firework schematics, augmented versions of the display he had refused to design for his brother's wedding fifteen years ago—the last request before their estrangement and his brother's unexpected death. <words>273</words>

"Time flows like water," the librarian explained, "and occasionally forms eddies where adjustments can be made." <words>288</words> Alistair worked feverishly, translating frost patterns into explosive formulations, understanding now why he'd been collecting leaves all these years—each one represented a moment, preserved between pages while subtle paths unfolded around him. <words>322</words>

He emerged from the waterfall library three days later by the world's reckoning, though it felt like months to him. <words>341</words> That night, he launched a special display above his brother's grave—explosions forming frost-like crystalline patterns that briefly illuminated quantum pathways across the sky. <words>364</words>

Somewhere across time's membrane, at a wedding reception fifteen years past, identical fireworks bloomed above a joyful gathering—a gift now simultaneously given and received. <words>387</words> And when Alistair returned to his car the next morning, the frost had formed one final pattern: two brothers embracing, preserved for a moment before melting away. <words>414</words>
