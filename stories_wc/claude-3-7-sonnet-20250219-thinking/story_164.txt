Oren hunched over his workbench in the back room of the Neon Nexus Arcade, his calloused fingers—remnants of his blacksmithing days—tracing the edges of faded botanical drawings. <words>24</words>

The pages were ancient treasures, depicting plants that no longer existed in the concrete sprawl of Neo Shanghai. <words>41</words>

Between the hourly virtual reality shows, when the arcade emptied and the holograms reset, Oren had exactly seventeen minutes to pursue his obsession. <words>61</words>

His colleagues found his interest in extinct flora obviously subtle—they noticed his collection but dismissed it as harmless nostalgia, failing to see the revolution blooming beneath their noses. <words>84</words>

Nobody questioned why he'd positioned his workbench directly under the arcade's single skylight, the only connection to the natural world above. <words>103</words>

Each day, Oren meticulously mapped the swirl of dust motes dancing in the shaft of sunlight, recording their patterns with drifting arrogance that came from knowing what others didn't. <words>129</words>

The dust trajectories revealed something the corporations had tried to erase from human knowledge: the invisible currents of wild energies that once flowed through the earth. <words>152</words>

"Nature's blueprint," he whispered, comparing the dust patterns to a drawing of a spiral-seeded dandelion. <words>167</words>

When the ten-minute warning chimed, signaling the end of the break between acts, Oren slipped the drawings into his thermal sleeve and returned to fixing broken VR headsets. <words>193</words>

That night, he smuggled himself onto the roof, carrying a small pouch of seeds he'd cultivated from DNA sequences extracted from his botanical archives. <words>217</words>

The rooftop was his forge now, and information was his metal—he'd spent three years mapping dust patterns, correlating them with ancient growth cycles, and encoding the data into seeds that could survive the city's toxic atmosphere. <words>250</words>

He knelt on the gravel and began to kindle life in the most literal sense, planting his engineered seeds in precise locations where the building's energy fields—mapped through dust patterns—would nourish rather than destroy them. <words>282</words>

"To reclaim the wild," Oren murmured, his weathered face illuminated by the neon advertisements reflecting off neighboring skyscrapers, "one must first remember it exists." <words>305</words>

By dawn, microscopic roots would be spreading beneath the synthetic city, connecting to others he'd planted across Neo Shanghai, creating a hidden network of actual, living plants. <words>332</words>

His motivation had never been simple nostalgia—it was to weave fantasy into reality's cracks, to prove that nature wasn't just something in children's storybooks. <words>355</words>

The wistful blacksmith had found a new material to shape: the collective imagination of a generation who had never seen a real flower bloom. <words>378</words>

As Oren descended back to his quarters, the first sprout pushed through the gravel behind him, its green glow indistinguishable from the city's artificial lights to any casual observer. <words>408</words>

By next week, when patrons looked up from their VR headsets during breaks, they might notice something unusual growing along the skylight—something not programmed, not manufactured, but wild. <words>435</words>

And Oren would watch their confused faces with that same drifting arrogance, the quiet pride of a craftsman who had successfully forged the impossible. <words>458</words>

Soon they would all understand what the dust had been telling him for years: that beneath the chrome and code, reality remained fertile ground for revolution. <words>485</words>
