The stoic wanderer paused at the edge of the witch's familiar training ground, worn boots silently pressing into soil that hummed with ancient power. <words>21</words>

His eyes fixed on the schoolhouse where a teacher was wiping away the final formula from a curved slate board, erasing knowledge he had traveled so far to preserve. <words>43</words>

The meadow around him appeared mesmerizingly bland to untrained eyes—just tall grass and scattered stones—the perfect camouflage for a place where familiars learned to channel magic through their beings. <words>69</words>

Clutched in his weather-worn hands was a simple floorboard from an abandoned cabin, its unremarkable grain hiding ritual inscriptions that had called to him through dreams. <words>92</words>

He had tracked this place by following a trail of nightmares that had infected the villages surrounding this hidden sanctuary, each terror-filled vision guiding him closer to this moment. <words>118</words>

"You're late, Thorne," the teacher called without turning, her voice carrying both steel and softness. <words>131</words>

"The Council doesn't know I'm here," he replied, the necessary lie settling between them like an old friend. <words>147</words>

The teacher finally faced him, chalk dust coating her fingers as recognition flickered across her face. <words>162</words>

"Those who seek to archive ritual practices are rarely welcomed these days," she said, gesturing for him to enter the empty schoolhouse. <words>181</words>

Thorne stepped inside, the floorboard held against his chest like something precious rather than the ordinary piece of lumber it appeared to be. <words>202</words>

"I need to impose upon your expertise," he said, placing the wood onto her desk with unexpected gentleness. <words>219</words>

The teacher's fingers hovered over the floorboard's surface, her eyes widening as she sensed what lay dormant within its fibers. <words>238</words>

"This contains the Binding Ritual of Maevan," she whispered, voice trembling with reverence and fear. <words>252</words>

"Yes, and three others that will be lost forever if we don't extract and preserve them tonight," Thorne said, his gruff demeanor softening as he watched her trace invisible patterns on the wood. <words>282</words>

Outside, the training dummies used to teach familiars stood like silent sentinels in the gathering dusk, witnesses to this forbidden exchange. <words>303</words>

"The High Witch declared these rituals dangerous," she murmured, yet her hands were already reaching for tools hidden beneath floorboards of her own. <words>326</words>

"Some dangers are worth preserving," Thorne countered, producing a journal filled with meticulously documented spells rescued from destruction. <words>342</words>

The teacher nodded once, decision made, and together they bent over the unassuming floorboard as she coaxed ancient symbols to the surface with a mixture of salt water and her own blood. <words>371</words>

"I've spent my life teaching what they permit me to teach," she said, her brash confidence returning as forbidden glyphs began to glow, "but tonight we save what they tried to erase." <words>403</words>

Thorne's hand found hers briefly—a moment of tenderness from a man who had forgotten how to be anything but stoic—before they turned back to their work, extracting centuries of wisdom from aged wood as familiars gathered curiously at the windows, drawn to magic older than their training could explain. <words>446</words>

In the ghostly light of revealed rituals, the wanderer and the teacher became unlikely allies in preservation, their shared deception a small price for the knowledge that would live to see another generation. <words>478</words>
