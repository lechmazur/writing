Father Kell tightened the final screw on the miniature space station, his fingers trembling not from the delicate work but from what awaited him after. <words>21</words> The toy assembly line stretched before him in the recycling hub of Orbital Station Epsilon, where humanity's refuse became children's wonders amid the floating graveyard of satellites and rocket casings. <words>44</words> As an exorcist among the stars, Kell found his calling never usual, especially with the paralyzing stage fright that seized his throat whenever eyes turned expectantly toward him. <words>68</words>

He reached into his pocket, fingers brushing against the book of pressed wildflowers—violets and asters from an Earth he'd never known—bequeathed by his grandmother alongside the burden of truth. <words>94</words> "These blooms outlived the lies," she had whispered on her deathbed, revealing that their family's revered exorcism rituals were theatrical fabrications designed centuries ago to provide comfort to the desperate. <words>122</words>

The inheritance of lies weighed heavily as Kell's communication device chimed: another "haunting" in the executive quarters. <words>136</words> Commander Rey believed her private module was possessed by her dead husband's spirit, though Kell suspected grief spoke louder than any ghost. <words>155</words>

Kell gathered his ceremonial tools—incense burning in zero gravity created mesmerizing spirals, perfect for misdirection—and tried to submerge his anxiety beneath practiced breathing. <words>178</words> His ritual began not with ancient words but by the sound of a key turning in a lock—his grandmother's antique brass key that opened nothing physical but served as his psychological trigger to assume the confident persona his audience needed. <words>216</words>

Floating through Epsilon's corridors, past viewing ports that revealed the glittering belt of orbital debris that humanity now called home, Kell rehearsed his performance. <words>237</words> He wasn't removing spirits; he was easing pain, creating closure, spinning possibility from cosmic ashes. <words>251</words>

Commander Rey waited, eyes hollow with loss. <words>257</words> "He's here," she whispered, pointing to shadows cast by Earth's distant light filtering through the debris field. <words>272</words>

In a defiant hush that challenged his own limitations, Kell began. <words>282</words> The key turned in his pocket; his stage fright dissolved as he moved through the familiar motions. <words>297</words> He spoke of transitions, of energy transformed rather than lost, crafting comforting fabrications while weaving fragments of honest wisdom. <words>315</words>

As Rey sobbed with release, something unexpected happened: the module's lights flickered in perfect rhythm with Kell's chants. <words>331</words> A coincidence of solar flares and power fluctuations, surely, yet doubt whispered in his mind. <words>345</words>

Returning to his quarters, Kell opened the book of wildflowers and questioned everything he thought he knew. <words>360</words> Perhaps the greatest inheritance of lies was the certainty that he understood the universe's boundaries. <words>374</words> In this realm of human castoffs and endless stars, who could definitively claim what was impossible? <words>389</words>

Kell turned his grandmother's key between his fingers and decided: tomorrow he would begin sculpting new possibilities from the ashes of "never," starting with the truth—whatever it might be. <words>421</words>
