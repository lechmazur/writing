Vex adjusted her tattered neo-Victorian coat in the reflective surface of a deactivated drone, the once-elegant garment now a patchwork of synthetic fabrics and reclaimed circuitry that made her fashionably unfashionable among the night market denizens. <words>36</words>

The broke swashbuckler fingered the vintage hatpin—her last family heirloom—as neon advertisements painted her face in harsh blues and pinks, the market coming alive after the storm used up its last rumble over Neo-Shanghai. <words>67</words>

"Seeking fortune tonight, captain?" asked a vendor whose face was more metal than flesh, his tone suggesting he already knew the answer to his question. <words>88</words>

Vex shrugged with practiced indifference, though her heart raced with purpose beneath her deliberately casual demeanor. <words>103</words>

"Just passing through," she replied, a perfect performance of fervent apathy that had become her armor in a world that punished visible caring. <words>123</words>

The pawnbroker had been clear: bring him the location of Madame Oculus's hidden data cache by midnight, and he'd cancel the debt that threatened the children's shelter Vex secretly maintained in the undercity. <words>153</words>

The shelter—a haven for kindness in a world quite literally on fire since the climate wars—was worth more than her pride or safety. <words>176</words>

Rain-slicked streets reflected holographic dragons as she slipped beneath a dilapidated hotel, climbing fifteen floors of emergency stairs to reach the abandoned luxury suite where Madame Oculus had spent her final days. <words>206</words>

The room stank of synthetic incense and decay, but Vex immediately spotted what others had missed—antique glass marbles scattered beneath the massive bed frame, their swirling patterns too deliberate to be accidental. <words>236</words>

Using her hatpin to sketch their positions in the dust, Vex began charting the swirl of antique marbles, recognizing the old-world code her grandmother had taught her during the blackouts. <words>263</words>

Hours passed as she mapped each marble's position relative to the others, her fingers tracing connections that began to emit a faint holographic map when activated by the copper in her hatpin. <words>294</words>

"Clever old witch," Vex muttered with the ghost of a smile as the coordinates materialized before her. <words>309</words>

By dawn, she stood before the pawnbroker, her expression carefully neutral despite the victory burning in her chest. <words>326</words>

"Your debt is cleared," the pawnbroker growled, clearly disappointed as he reluctantly stamped her contract with finality. <words>342</words>

Three days later, as children played in the newly-secured shelter, a small girl with augmented eyes tugged at Vex's coat. <words>361</words>

"Why do you help us when nobody else will?" she asked, her synthetic voice tinged with static. <words>377</words>

Vex knelt, carefully pinning a loose strand of the child's hair with her grandmother's hatpin—a temporary gift. <words>394</words>

"Because someone once sheltered me," she answered, allowing herself the luxury of sincerity for just a moment before returning to her carefully constructed mask of disinterest as she stepped back into the chaos of a city that had forgotten how to care. <words>434</words>
