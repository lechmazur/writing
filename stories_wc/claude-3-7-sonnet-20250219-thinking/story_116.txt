Lyre strummed a melancholy tune on his harp as patrons of the Black Velvet sky-lounge gazed out at the sparkling metropolis that stretched infinitely below them. <words>23</words>

The dismayed minstrel's fingers paused over the strings when he spotted a familiar face among the photographs scattered across his table—a reminder of his impossible quest. <words>46</words>

His broken watch band lay beside them, its leather cracked precisely where the timepiece had fallen away during his frantic climb to the rooftop gardens last week. <words>69</words>

In his mind, it was subjectively rational to believe that time itself had boundaries that could be mapped, just as space did. <words>87</words>

"The endless night holds patterns," Lyre whispered to himself with laconic exuberance, eyes bright despite his frustration. <words>102</words>

Each evening, he would excavate meaning from the polaroids taken during his nightly wanderings through the floating garden that crowned the lounge. <words>121</words>

The photographs captured more than just exotic flowers and sculpted hedges; they revealed shadows that shouldn't exist, pathways that changed, and stars that moved according to rules he almost understood. <words>147</words>

Amid the garden secrets lay the truth of this impossible place—how a sky-lounge could hover perpetually over a city with no edges. <words>167</words>

Lyre had been hired to entertain, but his true purpose had become to draw a map of an endless night, to understand the boundaries between reality and whatever lay beyond the velvet darkness. <words>197</words>

He arranged the polaroids in a spiral pattern, noticing how the broken watch band appeared in the corner of one image, though he hadn't been wearing it then. <words>223</words>

By studying old polaroid photographs, he could trace the invisible lines where dimensions folded into one another, where time looped back on itself like an ouroboros. <words>246</words>

"Boundaries aren't walls," he murmured, fingers tracing the edge of a photograph showing a garden trellis that couldn't possibly exist. <words>264</words>

The lounge manager approached, concerned by the minstrel's distraction. <words>273</words>

"Your audience awaits, Lyre," she said, gesturing to the patrons who had come to hear him play beneath the black velvet ceiling that mimicked the night sky. <words>297</words>

He nodded, sweeping the photographs into his case except for one which he slipped into his pocket. <words>313</words>

As he played that night, his music drew invisible boundaries around the listeners, creating a space where his quest made perfect sense. <words>332</words>

Later, he returned to the gardens, where moonflowers bloomed impossibly bright against the backdrop of endless city lights. <words>348</words>

His fingers, calloused from both harp strings and digging through soil, carefully excavated a small metal box he'd discovered in the polaroids but had never seen with his naked eye. <words>376</words>

Inside lay a complete watch band, identical to his broken one, along with a hand-drawn map on parchment so old it threatened to crumble at his touch. <words>400</words>

Lyre laughed softly—someone had completed the map of endless night before him, had drawn the boundaries between worlds, had understood the garden's secrets. <words>422</words>

Now, with laconic exuberance burning in his chest, he realized he wasn't mapping the night—he was finding his way home. <words>441</words>
