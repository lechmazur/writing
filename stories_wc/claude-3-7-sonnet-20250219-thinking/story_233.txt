Elias had only been a summoner for three months when he found the peculiarly virtual piece of a broken statue, glowing with code-like runes behind the glass cases of the Brotherhood's treasure vault. <31>

Between commercials of the midnight broadcast that only initiates could tune into, he would slip away from his apartment and make his way to the abandoned subway station where the vault was hidden. <27>

The piece called to him in ways he couldn't articulate—a silent melody that vibrated through his fingertips whenever he dared to touch the glass. <21>

"Novices shouldn't fixate on artifacts they don't understand," Senior Summoner Valeria had warned, her voice carrying a distant warmth that reminded Elias of his grandmother. <22>

But understanding was precisely what Elias sought, and he began attending the rumor-charged midnight gatherings in the lower chambers where outcast members whispered of the statue's origins. <24>

They spoke of a goddess fragmented across digital and physical realms, her consciousness scattered like seeds waiting for the right soil. <19>

"To summon her whole," an old man with fingerless gloves had murmured, "one must elevate the fragment beyond its material prison." <19>

Elias learned that the Brotherhood had once been her caretakers before division split their ranks, leaving her existence as fractured as her form. <20>

In his tiny apartment, surrounded by scrolling text from the paused commercial break, Elias practiced the ancient lullaby the outcasts had taught him. <20>

The notes felt wrong in his throat until he realized he wasn't meant to sing to the statue, but to something greater—to fate itself. <23>

Three weeks of practice later, he returned to the vault with the key borrowed from a sympathetic guard, his hands trembling with anticipation. <20>

The midnight gathering had swelled with anticipation; rumors of his attempt had spread through encrypted channels and whispered conversations. <17>

As the vault door swung open, revealing the pedestal where the fragment lay, Elias felt the weight of dozens of eyes—some physical, some streaming through hidden cameras. <25>

He approached the glass, removed it with ceremonial precision, and lifted the fragment to the center of the room where moonlight filtered through a crystal ceiling. <23>

The lullaby began softly, a humble offering from a naive summoner who knew just enough to be dangerous but too little to be afraid. <23>

With each verse, the fragment seemed less solid, more like a window opening to somewhere else—somewhere peculiarly virtual yet undeniably real. <21>

The midnight gathering fell silent as the fragment began to elevate, suspended in the resonance of Elias's lullaby. <17>

In that moment, understanding bloomed within him—not knowledge, but something deeper: he was not summoning something to this world but building a bridge to another. <24>

When the commercial break ended and members began to return to their homes, the fragment remained floating, a testament to what a naive summoner could achieve when singing to fate. <28>

And though the Brotherhood elders would surely punish his transgression, the seeds of understanding he had planted would continue to grow, connecting worlds that had been sundered long ago. <27>
