Eira was the last convicted dream thief in a world where stealing dreams had become pointless after the last human child was born sixty years ago. <words>23</words>

She climbed the spiraling staircase to her sanctuary—a forgotten library inside a massive oak treehouse that overlooked the barren landscape humanity would leave behind. <words>45</words>

The shelves weren't filled with books but with dreams, each carefully extracted and preserved in small glowing vials that hummed with the dying energy of human imagination. <words>70</words>

In her trembling hands, she held a flimsy photo album, its binding coming apart like her own fragmented self—bits and pieces of other people's dreams had corroded her identity until she wasn't sure which memories were truly hers. <words>106</words>

"If only I could calculate how much time we have left," Eira whispered to the empty room, her fingers tracing incomprehensible patterns in the dust—being mathematically challenged had never bothered her until now, when humanity's remaining years might be countable on her fingers. <words>146</words>

The photo album contained the only evidence that she had once been whole: fading images of herself on a basketball court, before the dream-stealing, before the fragmentation of her consciousness. <words>175</words>

Basketball had been her salvation once, the shared love for the sport connecting her to others without needing to steal parts of their subconsciousness. <words>195</words>

That connection was what she needed now, to fulfill her impossible mission: to coax thunder from empty skies, to awaken the sleeping gods who might restart the cycle of human birth. <words>225</words>

With quiet mania, Eira arranged the dream vials in patterns across the wooden floor, her movements deliberate yet tinged with an edge of desperation. <words>247</words>

The ritual required dreams arranged in precise mathematical sequences—her greatest weakness—but basketball had taught her about trajectories, angles, and the perfect moment to take the shot. <words>274</words>

She opened the photo album to its center page, where a pressed flower marked the memory of the championship game when thousands had chanted her name, their collective energy almost tangible in the air. <words>306</words>

That energy was what she needed to recreate, to amplify, to direct upward into the silent heavens. <words>322</words>

"The final play," she murmured, positioning the last vial, a dream about rebirth that she'd saved for decades, taken from a mother who'd dreamed of her unborn child. <words>349</words>

Outside, the sky darkened as if in anticipation, the air growing dense with potential. <words>362</words>

Eira stood at the treehouse window, the height dizzying as she looked down at the pattern of dreams glowing below, now complete despite her mathematical shortcomings. <words>387</words>

She took a deep breath, clutching the photo album to her chest, and remembered the feeling of soaring toward a basket, of knowing exactly when to release the ball. <words>414</words>

With that muscle memory guiding her, Eira stepped onto the windowsill and, with perfect form, executed her final play—a plunge from the treehouse that would either end her fragmented existence or complete the circuit needed to awaken the skies. <words>449</words>

As she fell, the dreams below erupted in light, and for the first time in thirty years, thunder rolled across the empty sky, promising rain, promising renewal, promising that the last human born would not be the last after all. <words>483</words>
