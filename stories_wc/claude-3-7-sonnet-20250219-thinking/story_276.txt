Xenix served as the uneasy emissary from the Proxima Centauri Council, assigned to Earth's orbital debris tracking station to monitor humanity's growing space pollution problem. <words>23</words>

The station staff found Xenix consistently surprising, especially the alien's fascination with Earth's seasonal rituals. <words>39</words>

Every Saturday, when the station rotated toward Earth's daylight, Xenix would organize picnics in the observation dome, meticulously arranging Earth foods they'd never eat but enjoyed watching humans consume. <words>69</words>

Throughout picnics spanning months, Xenix studied the crew with quiet intensity, searching for universal patterns in human behavior that might explain why Earth's inhabitants seemed so careless with their orbital environment. <words>96</words>

"Your species discards things so easily," Xenix said one day, using a thin coathanger to gesture toward the debris field visible through the dome's reinforced glass. <words>120</words>

Station Commander Chen lurched forward, nearly spilling her synthetic coffee, when Xenix added, "Yet you keep remnants of places you've visited," pointing through the rustle of postcards pinned to a fridge door in the common area. <words>153</words>

"Those are memories, connections to places and people," Chen explained, not realizing she was providing the accidental wisdom Xenix had been seeking. <words>174</words>

For three Earth years, Xenix collected these insights, each one a small branch of redemption for a species the Council had deemed unworthy of diplomatic relations. <words>198</words>

On the final picnic before Xenix's assignment ended, the emissary removed the postcards one by one, scanning each with a device no larger than a thumbnail. <words>222</words>

"Your garbage tells one story," Xenix said, "but these tell another—how you value experiences, connections, memories." <words>239</words>

Chen smiled as understanding dawned. "You weren't just tracking our space junk, were you?" <words>253</words>

"I was assigned to assess if humans deserved inclusion in the Galactic Accord," Xenix admitted, antenna quivering with what the crew had learned was embarrassment. <words>276</words>

"And do we?" Chen asked, watching as Xenix carefully reattached each postcard to the fridge. <words>291</words>

"Your species creates waste thoughtlessly, but you also create beauty and meaning just as naturally—this contradiction is uniquely human," Xenix said, extending three appendages in the formal greeting they had never before offered. <words>323</words>

As the station passed into Earth's shadow, Xenix added, "The Council will be consistently surprised by humans, just as I have been—perhaps that's exactly what our ordered universe needs." <words>349</words>

Later that night, Chen found a small metallic object where Xenix had sat—a thin coathanger twisted into an elegant model of Earth's orbital paths, with tiny lights marking where human satellites peacefully coexisted with natural space. <words>384</words>

Attached was a note in Xenix's geometric script: "To understand the universe, look not at what species discard, but at what they choose to keep." <words>406</words>

Years later, when the first human delegation visited Proxima Centauri, they brought picnic baskets and postcards—carrying forward the accidental diplomacy that began with an uneasy emissary's curiosity about refrigerator decorations. <words>435</words>
