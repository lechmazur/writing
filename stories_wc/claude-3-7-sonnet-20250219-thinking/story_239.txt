The power outage hit just as Margo finished her final illusion of the night, her frenetic movements freezing mid-flourish when darkness swallowed the theater. <words>21</words>

Clutching her battered metal lunchbox—the one containing her most treasured secrets—she stepped into the street where neighbors emerged from darkened buildings like cautious nocturnal creatures. <words>41</words>

"The university's tree ring reading room has backup generators," someone called out, voice carrying on the sudden zephyr that swept through the abandoned street. <words>61</words>

Margo followed the growing crowd toward the campus, her fingers tracing the dents in her lunchbox where she'd encoded her life's story in formally imperfect Braille that only she could read. <words>87</words>

The reading room was unlike anything she'd expected—circular walls lined with cross-sections of ancient trees, their rings illuminated by amber emergency lights that cast radiant shifts of shadow and glow across the gathered strangers. <words>119</words>

"Welcome," said the curator, an elderly woman with knowing eyes, "tonight, the past speaks directly to us through these wooden chronicles." <words>138</words>

Margo positioned herself against the wall, observing how the curator guided people to touch specific rings while narrating how drought, fire, and abundance had shaped each tree's existence. <words>163</words>

When the curator approached Margo, she whispered, "I know what you really are," and Margo's heart stuttered with secretive defiance. <words>181</words>

"Your illusions aren't merely entertainment—they're memories, aren't they?" the curator continued, gesturing toward the oldest tree cross-section. <words>198</words>

Margo's fingers tightened around her lunchbox as the curator pointed to a specific ring: "1922, the year your grandmother was born—the year the Verdant Theater hired its first female illusionist." <words>228</words>

Something uncoiled within Margo as ancient echoes seemed to converge on this precise moment, this darkness, this revelation. <words>246</words>

"How could you possibly know?" Margo whispered, her practiced stage confidence wavering. <words>257</words>

The curator smiled, tapping the tree rings. "These tell stories—as does your lunchbox, your performances, the way you move your hands... I recognize the pattern of someone threading a labyrinth with their own story." <words>287</words>

Around them, strangers began sharing histories in the amber light—secrets emerging in this unexpected sanctuary created by darkness. <words>304</words>

"You're not the only one preserving something precious," the curator said, sliding open a hidden panel in the wall to reveal hundreds of metal boxes like Margo's. <words>328</words>

"We're collectors of what others would erase," she explained, "guardians of formally imperfect histories that don't fit authorized narratives." <words>347</words>

The room hummed with connections forming as Margo, for the first time, unlatched her lunchbox before witnesses. <words>364</words>

Inside lay her grandmother's original illusions—women's magic disguised as mere entertainment—manuscripts of impossible feats performed when females were forbidden from true power. <words>387</words>

"I've been searching for the rest of her collection," Margo admitted. <words>397</words>

The curator's smile deepened as the emergency lights flickered, creating radiant shifts across ancient wood. <words>412</words>

"The power outage is no accident," she said, "it's how we find each other, generation after generation." <words>429</words>

As if summoned by her words, the zephyr returned, whispering through imperceptible cracks in the sealed room—ancient breath merging with modern air. <words>449</words>

The curator reached for Margo's hand. "Tell us your story, illusionist, and complete another ring in our hidden history." <words>468</words>
