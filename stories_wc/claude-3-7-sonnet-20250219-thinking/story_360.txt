Elwin clutched his fountain pen with a broken nib, the last gift from his departed mentor, as he wandered the dim passages of the underground city of the goblins. <words>24</words>

The faint echoes of children's laughter filtered down from the world above, playground sounds that seemed bizarrely cheerful in this realm of perpetual twilight. <words>45</words>

Being the only human necromancer among goblins made Elwin particularly conscious of his meek nature, his shoulders perpetually hunched as if apologizing for his existence. <words>68</words>

"The tangled tapestry reveals its patterns only to those who understand that death is merely another thread," his mentor had told him before passing into the very realm Elwin could glimpse but never fully comprehend. <words>101</words>

The ancient tapestry hung in the central cavern of the goblin city, its intricate weaving depicting symbols and scenes that supposedly contained the universal riddle that had obsessed scholars for centuries. <words>129</words>

Goblin children scurried around him, their rough play a stark contrast to his careful movements as he settled beneath the tapestry, spreading his notes with peculiarly sincere devotion. <words>154</words>

"You won't decode it with that broken tool," cackled Nyx, the ancient goblin librarian, pointing at Elwin's damaged pen. <words>172</words>

Elwin had once written spells of magnificent power with that pen, but since its nib had broken, so too had his confidence in summoning the dead for guidance. <words>199</words>

Above, the playground fell silent as afternoon rain began to fall, water seeping through hairline cracks in the cavern ceiling. <words>218</words>

A single drop formed on a stalactite directly above the tapestry, hanging precariously before falling through a shaft of phosphorescent fungal light. <words>240</words>

Elwin watched, transfixed, as the dew drop descended, briefly refracting light across the ancient threads of the tapestry in a pattern he'd never noticed before. <words>263</words>

In that moment of mystic simplicity, the scattered images on the tapestry aligned in his mind – not as a picture, but as a language, a cosmic grammar expressed through the interplay of shadow and illumination. <words>294</words>

His hands trembling, Elwin raised his broken pen and suddenly understood – the pen wasn't meant for writing, but for directing, for conducting the symphony of light and darkness that connected life and death. <words>326</words>

The playground sounds resumed above as the rain ceased, and Elwin stood with newfound purpose, using the pen to trace patterns in the air that mimicked the light's dance through the water droplet. <words>358</words>

Whispers filled the chamber as spirits responded to his call, no longer summoned through force but invited through understanding. <words>376</words>

"He has regained the true art," murmured Nyx, watching with respect as Elwin, still meek in posture but confident in purpose, conducted a conversation between worlds. <words>400</words>

The tangled tapestry had never been about deciphering death, but about recognizing how life and death reflect each other, just as the dew drop had reflected both light and the woven threads in a single, perfect moment of clarity. <words>437</words>

As night fell in the world above, silencing the playground at last, Elwin smiled at the harmony he now perceived – the universal riddle answered not in words, but in the pattern of existence itself, revealed to one humble enough to truly see. <words>476</words>
