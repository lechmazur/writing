Lord Elias Verne glanced at his phone, watching for a reply that refused to come. <words>12</words>

In this lull between text messages, he returned to the task at hand in the shadowy corners of the spontaneous combustion lab. <words>29</words>

His family name, once revered in scientific circles, had faded into obscurity after the scandal, leaving him a forgotten noble in a world that had moved on without him. <words>54</words>

The artificial hummingbird drone hovered near his shoulder, its ruby-glass eyes recording everything as he spread the old ticket stubs across the metal workbench. <words>78</words>

"These are all that remain of the demonstrations," he muttered, the drone's wings creating a soft metallic hum that masked his words from potential listeners. <words>100</words>

Each stub was mysteriously obvious in its significance – date, seat number, event title – innocent details that, when assembled correctly, revealed the pattern behind the supposedly random combustion incidents. <words>129</words>

He needed to fortify his case before confronting the Institute's directors. <words>140</words>

Through the reassembly of old ticket stubs, Elias methodically constructed a timeline that no rational person could dismiss as coincidence. <words>159</words>

His phone buzzed – just the electricity company, not the reply he awaited from his former colleague. <words>175</words>

The lab felt especially oppressive tonight, designed to contain explosions but somehow amplifying the hollow silence of his solitary work. <words>195</words>

"The public deserves candor," he whispered to the drone as it darted between the hanging heat sensors. <words>210</words>

That had always been his downfall – believing that truth mattered more than reputation, more than position, more than safety. <words>228</words>

With hollow recklessness, he arranged the final ticket stub – the one from his own attendance at Demonstration #37 – completing the pattern that would expose decades of manufactured "spontaneous" events. <words>256</words>

His motivation had never wavered: to cut through illusions that the Institute had carefully crafted around their weaponized combustion technology. <words>275</words>

The small, honest moments had accumulated – a technician's hesitation, a director's slip of the tongue, an assistant's tearful confession – each one a crack in the perfect narrative. <words>302</words>

His phone illuminated with another message: "Stop now. Final warning." <words>311</words>

Elias allowed himself a grim smile as he commanded the hummingbird drone to upload its footage to seventeen different secure servers. <words>330</words>

In the small moment between pressing "send" on his comprehensive report and the inevitable consequences, Elias felt the burden of deception lift from his shoulders. <words>356</words>

The laboratory door slid open silently behind him. <words>364</words>

He didn't turn, knowing what would come, feeling a strange peace in the candor of this final moment. <words>381</words>

The air around him began to heat unnaturally, molecules exciting toward their combustion point, but the truth was already free, impossible to contain. <words>404</words>

As his phone chimed one last time – a single word reply: "Done" – Elias closed his eyes, his noble purpose finally fulfilled in the laboratory designed to study the very phenomenon about to consume him. <words>438</words>
