Morgan entered the abandoned spaceport hangar, the phantom train ticket punch heavy in her pocket. <words>14</words> As a professional cuddler, she'd grown accustomed to people's uncomfortable glances when she mentioned her occupation, but tonight was different. <words>32</words> The cavernous dome, now strung with twinkling lights for the Compassionate Services Award ceremony, retained an air of ancient novelty, like a relic that had found unexpected new purpose. <words>56</words> She'd never expected to be nominated, let alone stand on the precipice of receiving recognition for work most dismissed as frivolous or inappropriate. <words>78</words>

The once gleaming metal walls showed signs of decay, their patina somehow enhancing rather than diminishing the space's grandeur. <words>97</words> Morgan ran her fingers along the ticket punch, a Victorian oddity that had belonged to her grandfather, a conductor who'd taught her that touch was the most unusually usual form of human connection. <words>126</words> She remembered his words: "Everyone craves it, needs it, yet we've built unspoken rules to deny ourselves this simplest comfort." <words>144</words>

Three weeks ago, at the farmer's market that popped up in this same hangar every Sunday, she'd had the chance encounter that changed everything. <words>165</words> The elderly man had approached her stall with suspicion etched in the lines of his face—Commissioner Blackwood, whose vocal opposition to "professional touching services" had nearly succeeded in banning her practice. <words>195</words> He'd stood awkwardly before finally admitting his wife had passed, and he hadn't been touched by another human in four years. <words>215</words>

Now, the crowd hushed as the commissioner himself approached the podium. <words>226</words> Morgan felt the weight of every second in that pregnant pause, that sacred hush before an acceptance speech begins. <words>244</words> She saw him scan the audience until their eyes met, and he gave an almost imperceptible nod. <words>260</words>

"I've come to understand," he began, his voice echoing against the curved ceiling, "that my prejudice against professional cuddlers stemmed from my own fear of vulnerability." <words>284</words> The ticket punch warmed in her palm as if absorbing the significance of this moment. <words>298</words> "Morgan Jensen showed me that human touch isn't something to legislate or fear, but rather a basic need we've forgotten to honor." <words>318</words>

Everyone applauded as if this revelation were perfectly natural, though Morgan knew how extraordinary this shift truly was. <words>334</words> The transformed spaceport—once a launching point for distant journeys, now a haven for human connection—seemed to embody her own journey. <words>353</words> When the commissioner finally called her name, Morgan walked forward through what felt like the threshold between two worlds. <words>371</words> The unspoken rules that had governed her profession—the sideways glances, the whispered judgments—seemed to dissolve like morning fog. <words>389</words> In this moment of triumph, she understood how the most meaningful transformations often came disguised as unusually usual moments, like a simple touch or a chance conversation over heirloom tomatoes. <words>418</words>
