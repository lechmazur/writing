Leonard Thornton never imagined becoming mayor; a ballot typo and an amused town council too entertained to correct it had sealed his fate. <24>

Each morning, he'd trudge through town with a perpetual scowl that locals found oddly endearing, his gruff honesty a refreshing change from the honeyed lies of politicians past. <40>

The tiny clockwork beetle he constantly fiddled with—a gift from his late father—clicked softly in his pocket as Leonard hunched over his coffee in the crowded corner café. <64>

"It's the carnival waste that's killing the monks' swamp orchard," whispered a voice from the table behind him. <81>

"Those recluses with all their ancient water wisdom still can't purify toxins that potent," came the worried reply. <98>

Leonard's weathered hands tightened around his mug; those monk-tended fruit trees had sustained their town for generations. <115>

"Blasted carnival," he muttered, abandoning his half-finished coffee and stomping toward the outskirts where colorful tents were being dismantled under the first pale rays of dawn. <142>

The carnival workers averted their eyes as Leonard confronted the ringmaster about the chemical runoff poisoning the stream that fed the orchard. <163>

"Just business, Mayor," shrugged the ringmaster, but a hunched old engineer approached Leonard afterward, pressing something into his palm—a tiny golden key. <184>

"For your beetle," the engineer whispered cryptically, "when the water calls to it, fate will answer." <200>

Grumbling about "dramatic carnival folk and their riddles," Leonard nevertheless found himself wading through the murky swamp water toward the monastery as the last carnival truck rumbled away. <229>

The hooded monks emerged silently from their simple wooden structures, watching as Leonard reluctantly inserted the key into his clockwork beetle's intricate shell. <251>

To his astonishment, the mechanical insect began to metamorphose, its brass segments unfolding and rearranging until it hovered above the polluted water, emitting a soft blue glow. <278>

"What in blazes—" Leonard started, but his complaint died as the transformed beetle began drawing the pollution from the water in spiraling, luminous threads. <305>

The eldest monk approached, unrolling an ancient scroll depicting the very mechanism now floating above Leonard's outstretched hand—a legendary purifier meant to arrive when the waters were most threatened. <335>

"So I'm meant to believe I've been carrying around some magical water-cleaning contraption in my pocket for years?" Leonard groused, even as reluctant awe crept into his voice. <368>

The monk simply pointed to a moss-covered mural showing a scowling figure who looked uncomfortably like Leonard, standing at a crossroads of the community's destiny. <394>

As the rising sun strengthened, revealing pollution-free waters already beginning to clear, Leonard watched fruit buds unfurling on trees that had been dying only hours before. <425>

"Fine," he sighed to the quietly nodding monks, pocketing the now-ordinary beetle, "but don't expect me to smile about changing fate before breakfast." <452>
