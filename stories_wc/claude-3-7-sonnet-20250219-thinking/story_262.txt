Professor Mira Kelvin taught ancient civilizations with such passionate precision that none of her students suspected she wasn't human. <words>18</words> Her righteously flawed mission—to recover the knowledge her people had gifted to Earth millennia ago—often left her conflicted about the deception necessary to complete it. <words>43</words> The newly restored Roman bathhouse, with its gleaming marble and echoing chambers, had been transformed into the city's most sought-after concert venue, where ancient acoustics embraced modern melodies. <words>72</words> It was here, throughout the concert season, that Mira believed she would find the final fragments of her people's legacy. <words>93</words>

One evening, as the solitary organist practiced in the central chamber, Mira slipped behind a column and pressed her hand against the warm stone. <words>118</words> The reverberation of the lonely church organ penetrated the walls, causing microscopic vibrations that revealed what human eyes could never detect—a loose tile behind an ornate sconce. <words>144</words> Her fingers trembled as she extracted a single puzzle tile, small and hexagonal, its surface etched with symbols that matched the tattoo hidden beneath her collarbone. <words>171</words>

Mira compared the tile's markings to the images in her memory, confirming it was indeed a key to the star maps her ancestors had left behind. <words>197</words> The knowledge contained within could prevent catastrophic climate collapse, if only she could complete the sequence. <words>212</words> Yet fear gripped her—fear of failure, fear of discovery, fear that humans weren't ready for such powerful wisdom. <words>229</words>

The organist struck a resonant chord that filled the bathhouse, washing over Mira like a wave of clarity. <words>247</words> She thought of her students, their eager minds and hopeful futures, and felt a fierce tenderness that surprised her. <words>266</words> These weren't the primitive beings her superiors had described but complex creatures worthy of salvation. <words>281</words>

The next day, instead of her planned lecture on aqueducts, Mira spoke about courage. <words>295</words> "The ancients believed that knowledge was sacred," she said, holding the puzzle tile hidden in her palm. <words>311</words> "They built these baths not just for cleansing bodies but for purifying minds through communion and conversation." <words>328</words>

After class, as another concert prepared to begin, she approached her brightest student and, with deliberate care, placed the tile in his hand. <words>350</words> "Sometimes we must break free from what constrains us to discover what connects us," she whispered, her alien heart racing. <words>369</words> The student's eyes widened as the tile began to glow faintly against his skin. <words>384</words>

That evening, as the organ's notes soared through the ancient halls, Mira watched her student solve a puzzle meant for civilizations beyond his own. <words>409</words> In breaking free from her fear, she had found a greater purpose: not merely to rescue lost knowledge, but to entrust it to those who would honor its power. <words>437</words>
