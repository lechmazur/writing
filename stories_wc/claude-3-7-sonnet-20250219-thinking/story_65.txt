The slapdash bard Loren stumbled toward the precipice, his lute bumping awkwardly against his back as loose stones skittered beneath his feet. <words>21</words>

Family members were already gathering at the edge of the tectonic plate, where two worlds ground against each other with geological patience, creating a place where the veil between life and death grew gossamer thin. <words>51</words>

Grandmother Elise, keeper of traditions, spread the ancient picnic blanket with reverent precision, her weathered hands smoothing wrinkles as if preparing an altar cloth. <words>71</words>

"You're late again," she scolded, but her eyes held the peculiar brightness that only appeared during these sacred gatherings—a melancholic glee that acknowledged both the joy of reunion and the sorrow of its brevity. <words>101</words>

Above them, suspended between jagged rock formations, the massive hourglass began its final trickle, counting down the moments until the rare phenomenon when time would pause and the sands would reset themselves. <words>130</words>

Loren fingered the brass doorplate in his pocket, its engraved symbols warm against his skin, the artifact his mother had pressed into his hands before death claimed her last winter. <words>157</words>

"When the sands reset," she had whispered through blue-tinged lips, "place this at the gathering and sing the song that comes to your heart—it's possibly impossible, but you might disrupt the pattern enough to free me." <words>192</words>

Now, watching his relatives arrange themselves in their traditional formation, Loren felt doubt claw at his throat—this ritual had sustained his family for generations, allowing them glimpses of departed loved ones while the hourglass reset its sand. <words>227</words>

His uncle passed ethereal sandwiches to cousins who pretended to eat, maintaining the charade of normalcy that made their brush with the afterlife bearable. <words>248</words>

When the final grain of sand hovered, suspended before its fall, the air crystallized around them and familiar translucent figures shimmered into existence—including his mother, bound in death's clutches but smiling with spectral joy at seeing her family. <words>283</words>

Loren's hands trembled as he withdrew the brass doorplate, its surface now glowing with inner light. <words>298</words>

"What are you doing?" hissed Grandmother Elise, her face contorting with alarm. <words>310</words>

"Changing things," Loren replied, placing the doorplate on the ground before drawing his lute forward and beginning to play a melody that seemed to rise from the grinding plates beneath them. <words>337</words>

His voice, normally uneven and unrehearsed, rang clear across the liminal space as he sang of doors standing open between worlds and the arbitrary nature of boundaries. <words>363</words>

The doorplate expanded, its brass frame stretching upward to form an actual doorway through which his mother stepped, no longer transparent but solid and warm and alive. <words>391</words>

"You've done it," she whispered, embracing him as the other spirits looked on with expressions ranging from wonder to horror. <words>410</words>

But beneath their feet, the tectonic plate shuddered violently, and cracks spiderwebbed outward from the doorplate. <words>426</words>

"What you've done isn't freedom," Grandmother Elise cried above the growing rumble, "it's destruction—death isn't meant to release its hold!" <words>447</words>

Loren's mother pressed her forehead against his and murmured, "Sometimes love must accept separation," before gently pushing him toward his living relatives as she retreated through the door. <words>473</words>

The doorplate contracted into nothingness as the hourglass resumed its cycle, leaving the family clutching each other on their picnic blanket—alive, together, and understanding finally that their tradition wasn't about escaping death but celebrating life while acknowledging its precious impermanence. <words>509</words>
