Dr. Ellis Morgan knelt beside a fallen oak, pretending to rake leaves while actually scanning the perimeter of Blackwood Research Facility for security cameras. <words>21</words>

The autumn air carried whispers of the strange creatures allegedly born within those walls before the place was abandoned twenty years ago. <words>40</words>

Ellis had spent years tracking cryptid sightings around Blackwood, finally gaining enough evidence to warrant this undercover groundskeeping position that allowed direct access to the facility. <words>65</words>

"Nothing interesting in these leaves except earthworms and acorns," Ellis muttered into a hidden microphone, knowing the academic board funding this research would be listening, while pocketing a peculiar metallic scale no earthly reptile could have shed. <words>97</words>

The service entrance yielded to Ellis's counterfeit keycard, revealing corridors where shattered mirrors lined the walls like frozen waterfalls of broken light. <words>119</words>

Ellis navigated the labyrinthine passages, each fractured reflection multiplying the lone figure into an army of researchers creeping through darkness with only a flashlight and stubborn curiosity as weapons. <words>147</words>

A battered plastic tray lay overturned on the floor of what appeared to be the main laboratory, its faded label reading "Specimen 47: Luminous Adaptation Trial." <words>173</words>

Ellis collected the tray, noticing blackened candle stubs scattered nearby—emergency lighting from the facility's final days. <words>189</words>

"Someone's been here recently," Ellis whispered, detecting fresh wax drippings among the dust. <words>202</words>

With practiced precision, Ellis extracted tools from a hidden pocket and began to trace the burn patterns in the blackened wicks, a technique that had helped excel at tracking creature movements where conventional methods failed. <words>234</words>

"These burns indicate non-human respiration patterns... something was breathing on these flames while they burned." <words>249</words>

A soft chittering sound emerged from behind a toppled cabinet, and Ellis turned to find glowing eyes peering through the darkness. <words>269</words>

Most researchers would have retreated, but Ellis—perhaps suspiciously trusting or foolishly brave—extended a hand toward the creature. <words>286</words>

"I know what they did to you here," Ellis said softly. <words>295</words>

The creature emerged—part fox, part something unclassifiable—and sniffed Ellis's fingertips before placing a luminous scale onto the outstretched palm. <words>317</words>

It matched perfectly with the one found outside. <words>325</words>

"The world isn't ready for you," Ellis said with a smile that held mischievous wisdom, "but I can help you stay hidden until it is." <words>348</words>

Ellis's true mission had never been to capture or expose—it had always been to protect these improbable beings, to sow seeds of a better tomorrow where science respected the mysteries it uncovered. <words>380</words>

The creature chirped and led Ellis deeper into the mirror maze, where reflections revealed more glowing eyes—an entire family of impossible biology awaiting their unlikely champion. <words>408</words>

"Your secrets are safe with me," Ellis promised, understanding that this fateful encounter in an abandoned lab would change everything about the research moving forward. <words>431</words>

As darkness fell outside and leaf-raking equipment lay forgotten by the facility entrance, Ellis began documenting the creatures' behaviors, recording notes on the back of the battered specimen tray—the first page in a new chapter of cryptozoology that would never see publication. <words>473</words>

Sometimes, Ellis knew, the greatest scientific achievements were the discoveries kept secret until the world was worthy of them. <words>491</words>
