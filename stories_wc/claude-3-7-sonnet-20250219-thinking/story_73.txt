Tomás had been the temple's gravedigger for forty-three years, his calloused hands as steady as his resolve. <words>16</words> The reimagined Aztec temple of Tenochtitlan served both as historical monument and sacred burial ground, its stone steps and carved serpents watching over the modern graves with ancient eyes. <words>43</words> Each evening, Tomás would polish his prized possession—a vintage magnifying glass inherited from his grandfather, who had discovered the temple ruins while fleeing revolution. <words>66</words> Through its brass-rimmed lens, he examined inscriptions others couldn't see, diligently recording them in journals bound with leather as weathered as his face. <words>87</words>

Tonight was different, the air heavy with unspoken words after Father Domingo's confession: the church planned to modernize the grounds, removing the traditional burial markers that had preserved ancient Aztec funeral rites for centuries. <words>120</words> Tomás stood alone among the tombstones, his spirit both grieved and determined as the whimsical illustrations in his journals seemed to dance with urgency in the twilight. <words>145</words>

He moved to the eastern corner where a broken fence line separated the consecrated grounds from the unexcavated ruins beyond. <words>165</words> There, through the hush of wind passing the splintered wood, came a sound like distant drums and whispered prayers. <words>183</words> Tomás raised his magnifying glass to his eye, and gasped—through the lens, transparent figures in feathered headdresses and jade jewelry performed rituals around spectral fires where the modern graves now stood. <words>216</words>

"The worlds are overlapping," he whispered, understanding dawning like the sun over the temple's highest point. <words>231</words> The ancient practitioners were trying to kindrelize the boundary between past and present, softening the edges where their world touched his with gentle persistence. <words>254</words>

In the raucous silence that followed his realization—a quiet so intense it screamed with possibilities—Tomás knew what he must do. <words>275</words> With movements both methodical and touched with whimsy, he began to dig not a grave but a channel, a pathway between realms. <words>297</words>

By dawn, he had created a spiral pattern connecting seven graves, mirroring the constellation map carved into the temple wall. <words>318</words> He placed his magnifying glass at the center, where the first ray of sunlight would strike it. <words>335</words> When light touched glass, a prism of colors illuminated the pattern, and for one breathtaking moment, past and present stood revealed to all eyes—modern mourners and ancient priests sharing the sacred space. <words>368</words>

Father Domingo found him there, surrounded by bewildered visitors who had witnessed the phenomenon. <words>382</words> "This is why we preserve the old ways," Tomás said simply, his lifetime of steady service culminating in this bridge between worlds. <words>402</words> The church never modernized the grounds, and Tomás continued his work, diligently whimsical in his devotion, a guardian of the place where yesterday and today embraced through the kindness of remembrance. <words>436</words>
