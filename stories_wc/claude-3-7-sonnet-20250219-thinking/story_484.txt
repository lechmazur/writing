Malcolm, the groggy brewer, stumbled through the gates of the forgotten mansion graveyard, his weathered fingers still stained with hops and barley. <words>19</words>

He had left his protest sign leaning against the rusty fence, another uniquely generic slogan that somehow still spoke truth to power. <words>39</words>

"Stand for something or fall for anything," it read, a mantra he had lived by since his youth, brewing both beer and dissent with equal dedication. <words>63</words>

The encroaching darkness followed Malcolm like an old friend as he navigated between the crooked headstones, the sunset casting long shadows that seemed to reach for his ankles. <words>90</words>

"I'll just wait here until they start chanting again," he muttered with characteristic flippant solemnity, finding odd comfort in the eerie silence between waves of distant protest cries. <words>117</words>

His boot crunched on something reflective—a piece of a broken mirror that caught the last crimson rays of daylight. <words>134</words>

Malcolm picked it up, watching his fractured reflection distort as clouds passed overhead, his face multiplied and warped across the jagged edges. <words>154</words>

"Fitting," he snorted, pocketing the shard as he approached the mansion's servants' entrance, its door hanging open like a slack jaw. <words>175</words>

Inside, dust motes danced in what little light penetrated the grimy windows, and Malcolm's brewing-honed senses detected the faint scent of old yeast and something less identifiable. <words>204</words>

A spiral staircase wound upward from the kitchen, and as Malcolm squinted through the dimness, he spotted the slightest discoloration on the third step—a rusty brown splotch that didn't match the patina of age covering everything else. <words>242</words>

Something compelled him to place his foot precisely on that spot, to initiate whatever might follow. <words>257</words>

The step sank with a mechanical groan, and somewhere above, clockwork began to turn. <words>270</words>

Malcolm climbed steadily, each step a decision to continue despite the darkness pooling at the bottom of the staircase like spilled ink. <words>290</words>

He reached a small landing just as the lull in the protest broke, a swell of renewed chanting vibrating through the mansion's bones. <words>312</words>

"Now or never," Malcolm whispered, withdrawing the mirror shard and using it to reflect a beam of fading light onto an ancient door lock. <words>333</words>

The mechanism clicked, revealing a hidden laboratory filled with dusty brewing equipment far older than anything Malcolm had ever used. <words>351</words>

Journals lined the walls—recipes for potions that promised to transform the drinker into the purest version of themselves, to become a living embodiment of one's values. <words>375</words>

Malcolm laughed, a sound caught between reverence and disbelief, as he lifted a centuries-old brewing manual. <words>390</words>

"So this is how one man can truly change the world," he mused, already mentally cataloging the ingredients he would need as the encroaching darkness finally filled the room completely. <words>419</words>

Outside, the protest grew louder again, but Malcolm had found his own revolution—one he would brew bottle by bottle, value by crystallized value, until the world finally tasted truth. <words>447</words>
