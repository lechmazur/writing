Darlene had been the Alleyway Angel for seven years before she decided masks were too much trouble. <words>14</words>

In the city of forgotten fountains, where moss-covered monuments trickled memories of bygone prosperity, her reputation preceded her unmasked face. <words>32</words>

She was, by all accounts, lazily ambitious – determined to maintain order in her five-block radius, but unwilling to patrol past midnight or wake before noon. <words>56</words>

The antique dentist's drill hung from her belt, not as a weapon but as a warning – a family heirloom that had once tortured her great-grandfather's patients and now served as her signature threat. <words>86</words>

Darlene's true passion was collecting traditional games from around the world – mancala boards, intricate chess sets, hand-carved tops, and dice made from knucklebones. <words>110</words>

Each game represented the art of resilience to her – how cultures preserved their identity through play, even in times of hardship. <words>130</words>

She funded her collection through a protection racket so gentle most shop owners considered it a neighborhood improvement tax. <words>148</words>

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Darlene would slouch in the back row of The Harmonic Handlebar, where four mustachioed men rehearsed their quartet, their songs punctuated by gossip about every notable person within twenty blocks. <words>184</words>

She would analyze their chatter with surprising precision, extracting patterns and predictions while appearing to doze behind her newspaper. <words>202</words>

Tonight, she positioned herself at the corner of Eighth and Meridian, where a rare operational fountain occasionally sputtered to life. <words>222</words>

The forecast had promised rain, and as the first drops began to fall, she waited for that mystical moment – the pause between raindrops when time seemed to stretch and possibilities multiplied. <words>253</words>

In that suspended instant, she would lure old Mr. Finkelstein into conversation about his rumored collection of Korean yut sticks, the last traditional game missing from her Eastern Asia display. <words>284</words>

The quartet's bass had mentioned that Finkelstein bragged about them at his weekly dialysis appointment, claiming they were carved from the wood of a royal palace. <words>310</words>

Darlene tapped the dentist's drill thoughtfully, its ancient gears catching the streetlight with a gleam that belied her ultimately harmless intentions. <words>329</words>

A raindrop splashed on the pavement, then another – and between them, that perfect pause where she stepped forward with practiced nonchalance. <words>351</words>

"Terrible weather for checkers," she commented as she sidled next to the old man sheltering under the awning, launching into her carefully crafted conversation. <words>373</words>

The city's forgotten fountains gurgled around them, witnesses to this strange dance of acquisition that kept her neighborhood safe and her display cases full. <words>396</words>

Some vigilantes fought for justice or vengeance, but Darlene operated on the principle that anyone willing to preserve the traditions of play couldn't be all bad. <words>421</words>

As the rain fell steadily now, washing the grime from stone cherubs frozen mid-spout, she smiled at her own peculiar place in the ecosystem of the streets – not quite a hero, not quite a villain, but something uniquely, whimsically her own. <words>461</words>
