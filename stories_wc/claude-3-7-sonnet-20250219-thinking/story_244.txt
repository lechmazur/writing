The final petal drifted from the old rosebush outside the neon sign repair shop, landing silently on Mira's weathered boots. <words>19</words>

Mira adjusted the sword strapped to her back, its weight a constant reminder of the blood she'd spilled as the Emperor's executioner. <words>41</words>

Inside the shop, colors pulsed and flickered—red, blue, green—casting spectral shadows across the tribal mask she'd acquired three days prior. <words>61</words>

Its labyrinthine carvings seemed to shift under different angles of light, revealing fragments of a map she was learning to decode. <words>82</words>

"The door of release isn't just myth," Xavier said, his hands steady as he twisted copper wires inside a broken hotel sign. <words>102</words>

"Those who find it can walk away from their past—completely." <words>113</words>

Mira nodded, reservedly bold in her response: "I've killed too many to deserve such mercy." <words>128</words>

But still, she would pursue it. <words>134</words>

For three months, she had worked here, repairing broken lights while gleaning secrets from half-truth historians who frequented the shop's back room. <words>155</words>

Professor Tallen claimed the door appeared only to those carrying genuine remorse; Curator Wei insisted it required a sacrifice; the wandering merchant Dorio swore it was hidden in plain sight, visible only through an artifact of ancient significance. <words>193</words>

Each account contradicted the others, yet contained slivers of consistency Mira carefully collected. <words>206</words>

Tonight, with the rosebush now barren—marking the winter solstice as the texts had foretold—she traced the mask's carvings with hesitant fingers. <words>228</words>

"You're actually going through with this," Xavier said, not a question but a statement tinged with concern. <words>244</words>

Mira's eyes remained fixed on the mask. <words>251</words>

"I've spent seven years carrying the weight of their faces, their pleas," she replied, her voice carrying a mellow intensity that filled the humming space between buzzing signs. <words>279</words>

Xavier switched off the main lights, leaving only the neon glow. <words>290</words>

The mask's carvings suddenly illuminated, projecting a luminous pattern across the shop's back wall—revealing what appeared to be a doorway where there had only been solid brick before. <words>321</words>

"How did you know?" Xavier whispered. <words>327</words>

"I didn't," Mira admitted. <words>331</words>

"I just followed the fragments until they aligned." <words>339</words>

Standing before the ghostly outline, Mira removed her sword and leaned it against the workbench—a gesture of surrender, of readiness to face judgment without defense. <words>365</words>

The door of release shimmered, neither fully material nor entirely spectral, waiting for her decision. <words>380</words>

Beyond lay the unknown—perhaps absolution, perhaps punishment, perhaps simply truth. <words>392</words>

Mira stepped forward, her shadow merging with the doorway's light. <words>402</words>

"Forgiveness isn't what I seek," she said, her final words in this realm carrying the weight of her resolve, "but I will face whatever waits on the other side." <words>430</words>

As she crossed the threshold, the mask's carvings stopped glowing, and Xavier found himself alone in the shop, surrounded by broken neon signs and the lingering presence of a swordswoman who had finally found her path. <words>465</words>
