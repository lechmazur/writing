Edwin Mercer, Royal Scribe to His Majesty's Court, clutched the prototype light bulb from Tesla's workshop as he approached the witch's greenhouse that clung precariously to the hillside cemetery. <words>25</words>

The glass structure gleamed like an emerald crown atop the headstones, its windowpanes fogged with the breath of exotic plants that had no business surviving in this harsh northern climate. <words>50</words>

Edwin was certainly uncertain about this visit—his starched collar and meticulous ledgers offered no guidance in such mystical matters, yet desperation had driven him to seek unorthodox solutions. <words>74</words>

"You've brought the item as requested," croaked Madame Thornwood, her gnarled fingers reaching for Tesla's creation, not a question but a statement that hung in the humid air alongside ferns that dripped with possibility. <words>101</words>

The scribe nodded stiffly, his spine as rigid as the quills he typically wielded, and watched as the witch placed the bulb onto a copper stand surrounded by crushed herbs and bone fragments. <words>130</words>

"And the letter?" she asked, extending her palm expectantly. <words>139</words>

Edwin withdrew the envelope from his waistcoat, the same envelope that had delivered the news of his sister's inexplicable condition—a malady that the finest physicians in London had declared hopeless. <words>165</words>

Madame Thornwood didn't open it but instead began analyzing the leftover adhesive from the once-sealed envelope, scraping it carefully into a mortar, adding drops of iridescent liquid, and murmuring words that made the greenhouse plants shudder. <words>195</words>

"Your sister isn't ill from natural causes," the witch said finally, her eyes reflecting the curious glow now emanating from Tesla's bulb. <words>214</words>

"She's been touched by something ancient, something that feeds on rigid thinking and closed hearts—much like yours, Master Scribe." <words>232</words>

Edwin wanted to bellow his objections, to defend his orderly world of facts and figures, but the light from the bulb suddenly pulsed in rhythm with his heartbeat, stealing his voice. <words>260</words>

In that greenhouse, surrounded by life that thrived among death, Edwin felt something shift within him—the moment when a puzzle piece finally fits—as Madame Thornwood pressed a seed into his palm and closed his fingers around it. <words>294</words>

"To save her, you must first save yourself," she whispered. "Nurture this as you would nurture compassion in that steel trap you call a heart." <words>317</words>

The quiet transformation began with a tear that escaped Edwin's eye, rolling down his cheek to land on the seed, which immediately sprouted between his fingers. <words>341</words>

As vines gently wrapped around his wrists, images flooded his mind: his sister's laughter, his parents' embraces, moments of connection he had dismissed in favor of precision and protocol. <words>367</words>

"I understand now," Edwin said softly, his voice steadier than his trembling hands. <words>379</words>

Madame Thornwood nodded, a smile creasing her ancient face. "To cradle empathy in arms of steel is the most powerful magic of all." <words>400</words>

Weeks later, when his sister opened her eyes, color returning to her cheeks, Edwin placed Tesla's bulb on her windowsill, now glowing with a warm light that needed no electricity—only the power of a heart once closed, now gloriously open. <words>438</words>

The uptight scribe had become something else entirely—still precise, still methodical—but now these qualities served to protect and nurture rather than to isolate and judge. <words>464</words>

In his study, a small greenhouse now stood beside his immaculate bookshelves, and sometimes, when he thought no one could hear, Edwin would bellow with laughter at the wonder of it all—the buried optimism finally unearthed and blooming in magnificent abundance. <words>500</words>
