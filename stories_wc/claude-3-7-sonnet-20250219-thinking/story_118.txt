Dr. Eliza Huxley adjusted her neural interface crown, the uniformly peculiar lights blinking in sequence along its rim. <words>16</words>

Tonight's session with the Nexus Unit—six agents neurally linked as a single hive-mind—would be different, she thought, plugging her equipment into the scuffed phone charger that had become her lucky talisman. <words>42</words>

Through the reinforced windows of the secret agent training facility, the night air seemed charged with possibility on the eve of what her subjects called their "bold discovery"—the first autonomous mission undertaken by a fully merged consciousness. <words>72</words>

"Welcome, collective," she announced, lighting thirteen black candles arranged in a specific pattern on the floor around the reclined agents. <words>90</words>

Dr. Huxley moved methodically, her face reflecting a merry bitterness—the expression of someone who'd found joy in a fundamentally flawed system. <words>110</words>

"Tonight we're going to drain the individual anxieties that still separate you," she explained, positioning metal receptacles beneath strategic points where the candle wax would eventually drip. <words>133</words>

The agents' synchronous breathing faltered momentarily, a ripple of uncertainty passing through their shared consciousness. <words>146</words>

"Your scattered thoughts become patterns through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes," she explained, gesturing toward the first droplet hitting a copper plate with a distinct chime. <words>172</words>

That crystalline sound—what Dr. Huxley called "the sound of hindsight"—made visible the moments when the agents' minds diverged from their collective purpose. <words>194</words>

"Listen closely," she instructed as another drop fell, creating an overlapping circle in the cooled wax. <words>210</words>

The six bodies twitched simultaneously as memories flowed between them—fragments of childhoods, training accidents, first kills—each memory translated through wax into symbols only Dr. Huxley could interpret. <words>236</words>

"I'm helping you anchor the ephemeral in reality," she said, studying a particularly complex formation that revealed their shared fear of losing individual identity. <words>257</words>

Agent Martinez, the most resistant to complete neural integration, whispered, "I can feel them all inside me now—not just their thoughts, but their regrets." <words>280</words>

"Precisely," Dr. Huxley replied, watching as the candles burned lower, their wax creating increasingly intricate patterns that mapped the collective's psychological landscape. <words>300</words>

Three hours into the night, the process reached its critical phase as the final barriers between the agents began to dissolve, their separate minds truly becoming one. <words>325</words>

"The wax doesn't lie," Dr. Huxley murmured, pointing to a perfect hexagon that had formed—the sign of complete neural harmony she'd been working toward for years. <words>350</words>

Director Chambers would have terminated the program months ago had he known her real objective: creating not just linked agents but a true hive-mind that could outlast its individual components. <words>378</words>

As dawn approached, Dr. Huxley carefully collected the wax formations, each one a physical record of the transition from six to one. <words>399</words>

"Tomorrow you deploy as something new," she told the now-perfectly-synchronized bodies, unplugging her equipment and smiling at the worn charger that had witnessed every milestone of her impossible work. <words>427</words>

Years from now, when the program's true nature was finally understood, these wax patterns would be her vindication—proof that she'd heard the sound of hindsight before anyone else and had acted accordingly. <words>458</words>
