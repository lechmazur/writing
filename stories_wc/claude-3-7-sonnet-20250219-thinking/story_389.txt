Mordeth ran his thin lips along the edge of the parchment, tasting centuries of dust and secrets. <words>15</words> The forgotten library deep within the abandoned Norsk Mine had finally yielded its greatest treasure—a discredited tome entitled "Optimizations of Ancient Power." <words>34</words> He adjusted his faded jeans beneath his ceremonial robes, his formally casual attire a reflection of his contradictory nature. <words>53</words>

"December thirty-first," he murmured with confusing certainty, knowing yet questioning if tonight—when the final calendar page of the year would be flipped—truly held the convergence of energies he sought. <words>81</words> The warnings from the Arcane Council meant nothing; they always feared those who reached beyond established boundaries. <words>97</words>

Mordeth's fingers traced the crude illustration of the viking ship figurehead fragment, its serpentine wooden curves unmistakable even in the flickering lamplight. <words>119</words> According to the rumored cures in these discredited textbooks, the fragment—when properly activated—could optimize one's connection to the primordial forces. <words>140</words>

"Three lost artifacts reunited under the dying year's breath," he read aloud, his voice echoing through the timber-supported chambers of literary relics that had been sealed away for centuries. <words>167</words> The other two pieces—a bronze astrolabe and an obsidian thought-catcher—already lay on his workbench, awaiting their serpentine companion. <words>189</words>

He had spent decades tracking these artifacts, ignoring repeated cautions from those who claimed such knowledge was buried for humanity's protection. <words>210</words> But to gorge on the fruit of knowledge was Mordeth's only true desire; he would consume these secrets regardless of consequence. <words>231</words>

The mine groaned around him as if in disapproval, ancient support beams shifting under the weight of mountain and judgment alike. <words>251</words> Mordeth simply straightened his ceremonial collar while keeping his lucky sneakers firmly planted on the stone floor. <words>269</words>

His ritual site was prepared—chalk sigils spiraling outward, candles placed at precise intervals, the mathematical perfection of it all satisfying his need to optimize even the smallest details. <words>299</words> The fragile pages of the textbook detailed the precise intonations and gestures required, methodologies dismissed by modern practitioners as dangerous superstition. <words>321</words>

As midnight approached, Mordeth felt the convergence beginning, the three artifacts humming in sympathetic resonance. <words>336</words> "They said these were merely legends," he whispered with absolute conviction despite the uncertainty of his venture. <words>353</words>

The calendar on the wall trembled as if caught in an unfelt breeze, its final page ready to turn by supernatural forces when the year's last second expired. <words>381</words> Mordeth's thin lips stretched into a rare smile as he prepared to receive what no warlock had tasted for millennia—pure, unfiltered knowledge from beyond the veil. <words>409</words>

The figurehead fragment began to glow with internal light, its wooden surface rippling like water, promising everything to the man who dared to drink from forbidden wells despite all warnings. <words>438</words> As the calendar page flipped of its own accord, Mordeth opened himself to the torrent of ancient wisdom, never once considering that some libraries remain forgotten for very good reasons. <words>470</words>
