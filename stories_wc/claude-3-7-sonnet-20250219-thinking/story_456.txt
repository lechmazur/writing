Mei cultivated funeral arrangements with meticulous precision, finding poetry in the dialogue between life and death. <words>17</words> As a morbid florist, she approached her craft with neutrally passionate dedication, neither celebrating nor mourning, but observing the inevitable transition. <words>38</words> Her reputation for understanding the symbolism of endings had spread beyond Earth, which was why she now found herself obliged to accept an invitation to the legendary floating rock dojo. <words>66</words>

The massive stone island hung suspended in twilight skies, defying gravity and conventional wisdom. <words>81</words> Ancient cherry trees clung to its edges, their petals drifting into the endless void below. <words>96</words> Master Kwan, a withered man with eyes like distant galaxies, greeted her at the entrance carved from luminescent stone. <words>114</words>

"You seek to understand the cosmic cycles," he stated, guiding her through corridors where starlight played between shadows. <words>130</words> Mei nodded, her response boldly timid—a whispered "yes" that somehow filled the cavernous hall. <words>145</words>

The inner sanctum contained only two objects: an ornate trunk and a plain white candle burning with inexplicable steadiness. <words>163</words> "Many seekers have contemplated the same questions," Master Kwan explained, lifting the trunk's heavy lid. <words>178</words> Inside lay hundreds of typed pages—journals, treatises, and poems from those who had sat where she now knelt. <words>196</words>

"Tonight, as this lantern gives its final light, you will find what you seek through the backlog of typed pages in this writer's trunk." <words>221</words> The master gestured to an ancient oil lantern Mei hadn't noticed, its flame guttering dangerously low. <words>237</words>

For hours, she immersed herself in the writings, her fingers tracing the thoughts of astronomers, philosophers, and mystics who had mapped the patterns of existence. <words>262</words> The lantern flickered precariously as she absorbed theories of universal breathing—expansion and contraction, bloom and wither, birth and death. <words>282</words>

With each page, Mei's understanding shifted. <words>288</words> Her clinical approach to mortality, once firmly rooted in detached observation, became tempered by a recognition of beauty in the patterns. <words>309</words> She saw how her funeral arrangements mirrored the supernova deaths of stars—endings that seeded new beginnings. <words>327</words>

The lantern sputtered, casting wild shadows across the chamber walls. <words>337</words> In that last flicker before darkness, illuminated only by the steady white candle, Mei finally grasped what she had come to learn. <words>359</words>

When dawn painted the floating dojo in gentle light, Master Kwan returned to find her surrounded by careful stacks of read pages. <words>380</words> "You have found what you sought," he observed, noting her transformed expression. <words>392</words>

Mei returned to Earth carrying no physical souvenirs, only a perspective that would forever change her work. <words>409</words> In her shop, she arranged lilies and chrysanthemums with new purpose, understanding that each petal's decay was part of a magnificent pattern. <words>432</words>

She remained a morbid florist, but one whose tempered beliefs now recognized death not as finality, but as one necessary movement in the cosmic dance—as essential as a white candle's steady flame against the coming dark. <words>475</words>
