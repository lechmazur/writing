Ranger Tomas patrolled the urban orchard with meticulous precision, checking each apple tree that stretched across the old highway overpass as if the fate of this post-dream world depended on it. <words>27</words> His grandmother had been the last Dream Keeper before humans lost the ability to dream, a fact that he mentioned to every visitor who crossed his path. <words>52</words> The trees whispered secrets in the wind, their branches swaying against a sky that hadn't been illuminated by human imagination in over thirty years. <words>73</words>

"The goddess Oneira still walks among us," Tomas would insist, consulting his plain notebook where he documented every unexplained occurrence in his orchard. <words>94</words> The notebook had belonged to his grandmother, filled with scribbled observations and diagrams that felt familiarly unknown to him—like forgotten memories or déjà vu captured in fading ink. <words>122</words>

Visitors to the orchard fluctuated with the seasons; more came during harvest, fewer during the barren months, but Tomas recorded them all with equal fervor. <words>145</words> "Each person might carry an echo of the goddess," his grandmother had written on page seventeen, "fragments of the last human dream ever dreamt." <words>167</words>

Through chance encounters, patterns emerged in Tomas's chaotic organization of notes: a woman who hummed melodies no one remembered teaching her; a child who described colors that didn't exist; an old man who spoke words from no known language. <words>203</words>

The orchard itself existed in perfect tension between wildness and structure—apple trees in rows, but wildflowers erupting between them; birds nesting according to invisible hierarchies; visitors following paths that seemed to shift daily. <words>235</words>

"The goddess's echo manifests in these contradictions," his grandmother's notebook explained, though Tomas had read this passage a hundred times before understanding it. <words>257</words>

One misty morning, Tomas encountered an elderly woman touching the bark of his oldest tree, her fingers tracing patterns that made his heart race with recognition. <words>281</words> "I knew your grandmother," she said without turning. <words>288</words> "We were the last to share the same dream." <words>296</words>

The air between them seemed charged, and Tomas felt the notebook grow warm in his pocket. <words>312</words> "She told me you'd be overzealous about this place," the woman continued, finally facing him with eyes that reflected impossible landscapes. <words>332</words>

"My grandmother's secrets," Tomas whispered, "they're actually memories of the goddess, aren't they?" <words>344</words>

The woman smiled as light shifted through the orchard canopy in rhythms that defied the sun's trajectory. <words>361</words> "Not memories of her—fragments of her." <words>367</words> "Your grandmother didn't document the goddess—she collected her, piece by piece, visitor by visitor." <words>383</words>

Tomas opened his notebook to a blank page that suddenly didn't seem blank at all. <words>397</words> As he watched, words appeared and disappeared on the page, instructions and maps and songs, the echo of the goddess fluctuating between existence and memory, waiting for someone zealous enough to piece her together again. <words>432</words>
