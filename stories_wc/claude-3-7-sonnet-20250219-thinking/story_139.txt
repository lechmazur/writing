Brother Tao awoke in the swaying aerial gondola, the ancient flute clutched in his weathered hands, his recurring dream still vivid behind his eyes. <words>21</words>

In the heartbeat after the dream returned, that vision of his twin brother attacking their monastery, Tao felt a renewed certainty in his mission. <words>42</words>

The stubborn monk had refused to believe the others when they insisted his brother was beyond redemption, choosing instead this solitary path across the snow-capped mountains. <words>66</words>

He unwrapped the visually unappealing flute from its cloth, its once-smooth surface now discolored and worn, bearing the marks of decades of use. <words>88</words>

From his pocket, Tao withdrew a creased shipping label that had led him here—a package his brother had sent containing only ashes and this flute. <words>113</words>

The gondola creaked as it climbed higher through the morning mist, a journey that felt suspended between worlds, much like Tao himself felt suspended between vengeance and forgiveness. <words>138</words>

Carefully, with the precision taught by his order, he began analyzing the tooth marks on the antique flute, harvesting the past through indentations left by his brother's playing. <words>164</words>

Each tiny groove told a story: here was anger, here was sorrow, and here—most revealing—was regret. <words>180</words>

His master had taught him this rare technique, insisting that the way one's teeth marked an instrument revealed truths even the player might not recognize about themselves. <words>206</words>

The monastery's scholars had perfected this method over centuries, a way of reading the soul through physical impressions left behind. <words>224</words>

Tao's intention had evolved from a simple wish to avenge his fallen brothers to something more complex—a desire to understand what had transformed his twin into something unrecognizable. <words>251</words>

A cautious enchantment filled the gondola cabin as sunlight broke through the clouds, illuminating the flute's scars in ways that revealed new patterns. <words>273</words>

His brother had always been the clever one, the shadow to Tao's light, but in this moment, the monk realized the path to victory lay in outsmarting his own dark reflection. <words>302</words>

The tooth marks revealed a pattern of hesitation before certain notes—a musical confession that suggested his brother's crimes were committed under duress, not malice. <words>327</words>

As the gondola approached the mountain station, Tao could see the remote temple where his brother now lived in exile, a place chosen not for hiding but for penance. <words>355</words>

The thin air carried sounds clearly: a familiar melody floating across the chasm, played on another flute with the same distinctive style. <words>378</words>

Tao gathered his resolve as the gondola doors opened to the windswept platform, knowing that confronting his twin meant confronting himself. <words>399</words>

He stepped out into the biting mountain air, flute and label in hand, no longer seeking to avenge but to heal—to harvest not just the pain of the past but its wisdom. <words>432</words>

In the distance, his brother waited, unaware that Tao had deciphered the truth hidden in the tooth-marked flute: a cry for help from a soul that had lost its way but yearned to return home. <words>467</words>

The monk moved forward with cautious steps, feeling not the weight of retribution but the lightness of possible redemption, like the gondola that had carried him across an impossible divide. <words>498</words>
