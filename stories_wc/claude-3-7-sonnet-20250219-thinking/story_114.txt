Loren was an apathetic summoner with a peculiar talent for conjuring entities while barely lifting a finger. <words>15</words> He approached his mystical capabilities with enthusiastic laziness, perfecting techniques that required minimal exertion but yielded maximum results. <words>32</words> His apartment overlooked the churning sea, now discolored and sickly since the last breath of the dying ocean god Thalassos had bubbled to the surface three months ago. <words>57</words> 

Each night, Loren carried his grandfather's rustic coffee grinder to the shared dream recording studio hidden beneath the city lighthouse. <words>75</words> The ancient device, worn smooth by generations of hands, was the only object that could properly grind the phosphorescent dream-stones collected from riverbeds. <words>97</words> "River wisdom doesn't surrender its secrets to modern machinery," his mentor had told him with gentle sharpness, a truth that stung precisely because it couldn't be denied. <words>123</words>

Inside the studio, dreamers lay in reclined chairs, their consciousness flowing into a collective pool while technicians captured and cataloged the shared visions. <words>145</words> Loren had never cared much about the ecological collapse until dream fragments of dying coral began interrupting his favorite summoning shortcuts. <words>165</words> The images haunted him—polyps closing like tiny farewell gestures, vibrant colors fading to skeletal white—stirring an unexpected purpose within his typically unmotivated heart. <words>190</words>

"Even the most magnificent laziness requires a habitable planet," he muttered to himself as he ground the stones into fine powder. <words>209</words> The dust released whispers of ancient rivers that had witnessed millennia of wisdom, their knowledge preserved in mineral memory. <words>227</words>

The final step of the ritual required Loren to unfold the compressed wisdom through matching empty frames hanging in a deserted hall adjacent to the studio. <words>250</words> As he sprinkled the ground powder into the air, it swirled unnaturally before settling into the empty frames, each suddenly filling with complementary images: coral and current, polyp and predator, symbiosis and salvation. <words>279</words> The frames vibrated, then aligned perfectly despite remaining on separate hooks, creating a dimensional blueprint that only a summoner could interpret. <words>299</words>

That night, Loren drifted with fifty other dreamers into the shared consciousness, his summoning spells weaving marine entities that hadn't existed since Thalassos's reign—tiny guardian spirits that could regenerate coral structures and purify surrounding waters. <words>329</words> The entities multiplied within the dream, then transmigrated through the dreamers into reality, scattering across ocean floors worldwide. <words>348</words> 

Months later, satellite images confirmed the first regrowth of devastated reefs. <words>359</words> Loren acknowledged the news with a dismissive wave, already reclined in his favorite chair, perfecting a technique to summon creatures that would require even less effort. <words>384</words> He remained as apathetic as ever, yet somehow managed to channel his distinctive indolence toward preserving what remained of the world's beauty. <words>405</words> The rustic grinder sat on his windowsill, awaiting the next crisis that would require his enthusiastically lazy intervention. <words>423</words>
