Sir Galen stood beneath the crumbling arch of the ancient aqueduct, his armor catching the last copper rays of the desert sun. <words>18</words>

The earnest knight traced weathered stone with calloused fingers, finding paths unknowingly familiar to his touch, like memories from another life. <words>37</words>

Between the distant mountain passes that had guided his journey, time seemed suspended in the shimmering heat of the arid wasteland. <words>55</words>

His quest — to spark flames in the frozen kingdoms beyond the desert's edge — felt impossibly distant as sweat trickled down his back. <words>75</words>

The parchment he carried, an astronomical map inherited from his grandfather, had directed him to this forgotten place where water once flowed toward green lands. <words>97</words>

"Even the driest paths lead somewhere," his grandfather would say, words that echoed with crisp nostalgia in Galen's mind. <words>115</words>

Seeking shelter from the approaching night, he discovered a structure nestled against the aqueduct's curve: a rundown greenhouse, its glass walls still standing though its purpose was long abandoned. <words>142</words>

Moonlight streamed through tears in the glass roof, casting prismatic patterns across the dusty floor. <words>156</words>

Something stirred in Galen's memory as he watched the light shift and dance. <words>168</words>

He removed his gauntlets and retrieved the astronomical map, holding it up to compare with the pattern of broken glass above. <words>188</words>

The constellations matched perfectly, as if the greenhouse had been deliberately damaged to reflect the heavens. <words>203</words>

With trembling hands, he began to trace the connections, mapping tears that mirrored stars, using charcoal on scraps of parchment. <words>221</words>

As he completed the final line, something began to trigger within the structure — a mechanism older than the aqueduct itself. <words>239</words>

Water, impossibly fresh and clear, began to seep from hidden channels in the walls, collecting in ancient basins. <words>256</words>

The greenhouse floor illuminated with buried crystals that caught each droplet, projecting a glowing map across the walls: not of stars, but of underground rivers spanning the desert. <words>281</words>

"The true canvas of life," Galen whispered, recalling his grandfather's words about the hidden waters that waited beneath barren lands. <words>299</words>

He understood now why the frozen kingdoms had sent him here — not to bring fire, but to rediscover the desert's secret heart. <words>319</words>

The knowledge of water would warm the ice-bound lands more truly than any flame. <words>333</words>

Dawn found the knight carefully copying the water map onto his parchment, the original star patterns now overlaid with rivers like veins on an ancient hand. <words>356</words>

Before departing, Galen knelt in the greenhouse and allowed himself one moment of grief — for his grandfather who had known this place, for the civilizations that had built it, for the knowledge almost lost to time. <words>389</words>

His tears fell onto the dusty floor, merging with the revealed waters, completing a circle begun generations before. <words>406</words>

Armored once more, map secured against his heart, the earnest knight stepped back into the desert sun, continuing his journey between mountain passes, carrying an answer unknowingly sought by lands he had yet to see. <words>438</words>
