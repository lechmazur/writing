Jensen fingered the plain wooden bead in his pocket as he settled into the abandoned train station waiting area, his makeshift sanctuary between the shadows of his past and his quest for justice. <words>30</words>

The antique funhouse mirror propped against the wall was his most valuable possession, not for its monetary worth but for what it revealed to those who knew how to look. <words>55</words>

War had taught Jensen that perception was everything; what others saw as his artfully clumsy movements were actually precise calculations, each stumble and fumble purposeful in its execution. <words>80</words>

"Good morning, team," he said with practiced enthusiasm as his laptop screen filled with the faces of coworkers, his day job as a marketing analyst the perfect cover for a subdued vigilante. <words>107</words>

While nodding along to budget projections, Jensen's eyes darted to the warped reflection in the funhouse mirror, where he could track the subtle distortions that indicated movement outside the abandoned building. <words>135</words>

The ancient art of Mirror Walking was dying, but Jensen was determined to master it, to honor the mentor who had saved him when he returned broken from the battlefield. <words>164</words>

"I'm impressed by how you've increased engagement this quarter," he said, taking care to flatter his supervisor while simultaneously counting the ripples in the mirror's surface—three distinct signatures moving northeast. <words>193</words>

The wooden bead had belonged to a child in a village his unit had been ordered to "secure"—a euphemism whose true meaning had cost Jensen his peace, his marriage, and nearly his sanity. <words>226</words>

In the screaming silence of the waiting area, where announcements of arrivals and departures had long ceased, Jensen could focus on the distorted images that others would dismiss as mere tricks of light. <words>255</words>

His fingers danced over the keyboard, responding to work messages while his peripheral vision cataloged the mirror's revelations about the arms dealers who had set up shop three blocks away. <words>282</words>

"I think your strategy is exactly what we need," he continued smoothly, watching his supervisor preen at the flattery while Jensen mentally mapped the movements of those he hunted. <words>309</words>

The price of war wasn't just counted in lives lost but in souls fragmented, in quiet battles fought long after the official conflicts ended. <words>332</words>

As the virtual meeting dragged on, Jensen felt the bead warm in his palm—a reminder, a promise, a talisman that kept him connected to his purpose. <words>359</words>

The mirror suddenly revealed a fourth distortion, larger than the others, moving with purpose toward the known location of a weapons cache. <words>382</words>

Jensen maintained his pleasant expression for his colleagues while his mind raced through calculations and contingencies—tonight would be the night to move. <words>404</words>

In this abandoned place of transitions, surrounded by dust and memories, Jensen practiced an art that bridged worlds: the visible and invisible, the past and future, the man he pretended to be and the vigilante he had become. <words>441</words>

The war had taken everything from him, but in its place had left this—a purpose etched in silence, a justice sought without fanfare, and the weight of a single wooden bead that reminded him why the fight was worth the cost. <words>482</words>
