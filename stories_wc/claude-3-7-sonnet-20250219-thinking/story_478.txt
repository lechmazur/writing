Elara, the critical midwife of Pomona, moved through the orchard island's twisted fruit trees as they drifted endlessly within the swirling maelstrom that had claimed them decades ago. <words>24</words> The island's inhabitants valued her sharp tongue as much as her skilled hands, knowing her critiques came from a place of care rather than cruelty. <words>47</words> She kept her book of pressed herbs openly displayed in her cottage window—an invitation and a warning both, in her openly secretive way. <words>69</words>

Under the waxing moon's glow, Elara felt the familiar headache return, the one that signaled another missing piece of herself. <words>89</words> Three months prior, something had stolen fragments of her memory, leaving her with troubling gaps she couldn't explain. <words>105</words> The villagers noticed nothing different, but Elara sensed the absence like phantom limbs. <words>118</words>

That night, as sea spray kissed her windows and the maelstrom howled its lullaby, the fire in her hearth suddenly died, leaving behind peculiar ash patterns. <words>142</words> Kneeling before the fireplace, Elara discovered half-burned diaries wedged behind loose stones—journals she had no memory of writing. <words>159</words> "Strange," she whispered, fingers trembling as she extracted the scorched pages, "someone tried to burn away my own thoughts." <words>176</words>

Within these charred remnants lay pressed herbs she recognized—moonflower, memory root, storm thistle—alongside birth records written in her hand for children who didn't exist. <words>197</words> The dissonant calm that had settled over her life cracked; outwardly she remained the composed midwife while inwardly chaos reigned. <words>216</words>

Elara worked methodically through the night, arranging fragments of burned pages beneath the strengthening moonlight. <words>230</words> "Thirteen births," she muttered, "thirteen children born during eclipse tides, thirteen families who paid in memories rather than coin." <words>248</words>

She brewed an infusion from the pressed herbs preserved between diary pages, inhaling the familiar yet forgotten scent. <words>264</words> The island rocked gently as the maelstrom intensified, fruit trees bending but never breaking against the perpetual storm. <words>280</words>

To recover what was stolen, she would need to transcend the boundaries between known and unknown, between midwife and memory keeper. <words>299</words> She had been more than a birth attendant—she had been the island's protector, extracting painful memories from families as payment, absorbing their trauma so they could begin anew. <words>326</words>

Drinking the bitter infusion, Elara closed her eyes as the waxing moon reached its zenith. <words>340</words> Knowledge flooded back—how she had volunteered to carry the island's collective pain, how eventually the burden grew too heavy, how she had tried to destroy the evidence of her sacrifice. <words>368</words>

The orchard island shuddered as Elara reclaimed her purpose. <words>377</words> Her growing wisdom had come at terrible cost, but as the moon illuminated her tear-streaked face, she understood the necessity of her openly secretive role. <words>399</words>

She would continue to deliver babies and collect sorrows, to critique and to heal, to remember what others could not—adrift in the maelstrom, yet somehow always home. <words>429</words>
