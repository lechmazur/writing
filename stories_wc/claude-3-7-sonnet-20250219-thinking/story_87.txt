Meriwether Price adjusted her brass-rimmed spectacles as the gears of the dining hall ceiling whirred above, casting dancing shadows across her meticulously organized cataloguing desk. <words>22</words>

She had chosen this corner of the vast steampunk dining hall specifically for its isolation, away from the chatter of mechanically enhanced conversations and the hiss of steam-powered serving carts. <words>44</words>

The wrinkled sticker sheet lay before her, discovered between pages 394 and 395 of "Theoretical Applications of Steam Resonance," its once-vibrant colors faded like memories left too long in the sun. <words>70</words>

As her fingers traced the outline of a smiling robot sticker, something began to throb behind her temples—not pain, but recognition. <words>89</words>

In the hush of a memory reclaimed, Meriwether recalled Viktor Chambers, her former colleague whose brilliant mind had once captivated her before ambition consumed him and he stole her research on sonic archival systems. <words>118</words>

The dining hall's brass fixtures seemed to pulse in rhythm with her quickening heartbeat as she carefully peeled a sticker from the sheet, revealing the small microgroove impression beneath—a miniature mixtape, disguised and preserved through Viktor's clever deception. <words>151</words>

Twenty years of patient librarianship had taught Meriwether to wait, to listen, to catalog not just books but the spaces between words where truth often hid. <words>176</words>

With hyperactively serene movements, she transferred the hidden mixtape to her pocket phonograph, her outward stillness belying the frantic calculations occurring behind her composed expression. <words>200</words>

The forgotten mixtape crackled to life, Viktor's voice emerging through decades of silence: "I concede, Meri—the Harmonic Classification System was always yours." <words>223</words>

Her fingers stilled on the phonograph's crank as the confession continued, establishing beyond doubt her ownership of the system now used in libraries throughout the steam-powered empire. <words>249</words>

To bury an old hatred was why she had spent years searching, but as his voice trembled through the recording, Meriwether recognized the hollow victory that awaited her. <words>275</words>

Vindication had come too late—Viktor had died last winter, his legacy secured, while hers remained a footnote in academic journals. <words>294</words>

The copper and brass patrons of the dining hall continued their elaborate social ballet, unaware of the small war concluding in their midst as Meriwether placed the sticker precisely back over the mixtape. <words>324</words>

With savage grace, she closed the book on what might have been, understanding that some victories arrive empty, like beautifully wrapped gifts containing only air. <words>348</words>

She would return the book to its shelf with the wrinkled sticker sheet inside—a time capsule for some future librarian to discover. <words>370</words>

The steam pipes overhead sighed as if in sympathy while Meriwether returned to her cataloguing with the same patience that had defined her career, her revenge neither sweet nor bitter but simply complete. <words>401</words>

Through forgotten mixtapes, she had found not the satisfaction she had anticipated but something more valuable: the freedom to finally assign Viktor Chambers his proper place—not as the thief of her life's work, but merely as an outdated reference in her personal archives. <words>440</words>

The phonograph's needle lifted with a soft click as Meriwether smiled, knowing that tomorrow she would begin writing her own classification system anew, without the shadow of what had been stolen. <words>469</words>

She was, after all, a patient librarian, and time had always been her most loyal companion. <words>485</words>
