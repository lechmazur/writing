Markus, the edgy tradesman with tattoos climbing his forearms like ivy, hunched over his workbench in the domed ceiling of his giant mushroom house. <words>20</words> The spongey walls absorbed the steady rhythm of rain outside, creating a comfortingly pessimistic atmosphere that matched his perpetual scowl. <words>36</words> Between calloused fingers, he rotated a torn corner of a flyer—the only remnant of a life he sometimes questioned had existed at all. <words>56</words> The fragment showed part of a date, half an address, and the edge of what might have been a face he once knew. <words>76</words>

Outside, the ancient windmill—forgotten by the village but never by Markus—creaked through what he calculated to be its final rotation before collapse. <words>95</words> Time was running thin, distorting his memories like heat waves over summer pavement. <words>107</words> "We're all just walking toward our own dissolution," he muttered to the glowing mushroom lamps that lined his curved walls, their soft blue bioluminescence making everything feel slightly unreal. <words>131</words>

On his left wrist, Markus wore three watches, synchronized to different planes of existence according to calculations only he understood. <words>147</words> His right wrist remained bare, scarred from an accident he mostly remembered, sometimes invented. <words>159</words> The watches would help him vectorize his path through the threshold—mapping coordinates across dimensions that operated on principles of emotion rather than physics. <words>178</words>

He packed minimally: the torn flyer fragment, a leather-bound journal filled with impossible geometries, and a single candle that sputtered and danced with ancient light. <words>200</words> The candle was his purpose, had always been his purpose—to carry this flickering flame through the endless void between realities, preserving something warm and fragile against the cold indifference of infinity. <words>230</words>

The mushroom house groaned as its mycelia sensed the windmill's impending stillness. <words>241</words> Markus checked his watches one final time, noting with grim satisfaction that they aligned exactly as the ancient texts had foretold. <words>259</words>

"Memory lies," he said to no one, his voice absorbed by the fungal walls. <words>271</words> "But that doesn't mean it isn't true in its own distorted way." <words>283</words>

He struck a match against rough fingertips and lit the candle, its light bleeding at the edges with an impossible blurry vividness that suggested it existed in multiple dimensions simultaneously. <words>311</words> The flyer fragment seemed to pulse in his pocket, each beat resurrecting fragments of faces, places, and conversations that shifted like sand between his fingers. <words>334</words>

As the final groan of the windmill's rotation echoed across the valley, Markus pressed his palm against the softest part of his mushroom wall, which dilated open like a pupil adjusting to darkness. <words>363</words> Beyond lay not the forest he knew existed outside, but the void—vast, demanding, and patient. <words>377</words>

"Right on schedule," he nodded to the darkness with the comforting certainty of a man who expected nothing but the inevitable. <words>395</words> The candle flickered but held steady as he stepped through the threshold, a solitary light moving with precise coordinates through the nothingness, guided by synchronized watches and the distorted memory of something worth preserving. <words>426</words>
