Lin Mae adjusted her small wire coil transmitter as the hushed atmosphere of the capsule hotel settled around her. <words>17</words> Tomorrow's temporal alignment test would determine if she could continue her dutiful scholarly work across the centuries, but tonight, her mind buzzed with dangerous intention. <words>43</words> She studied her reflection in the capsule's mirror—an uncommonly typical face that would never draw attention from the Time Authority monitors patrolling the corridors. <words>69</words>

The transmitter had captured something unprecedented three days ago when she'd lowered it into that ancient well in 1623: the whispered confession of a woman whose testimony had been systematically erased from history. <words>105</words> Those echoes, preserved in the coil's memory, verified what Lin had always suspected about the Great Divergence—that the official chronology had been sanitized. <words>131</words>

Lin's capsule, like all others in the Chronos Hotel, was designed for brief stays between temporal jumps: utilitarian, sterile, and constantly monitored. <words>156</words> The calm before an academic evaluation always brought a stillness to the place as travelers retreated into their pods to review research or sleep off era-lag. <words>186</words>

She removed the standard-issue temporal stabilizer from her wrist and connected it to the coil. <words>202</words> The unspoken heart of her research—what she'd never dared document officially—was that history itself had been contaminated, not by divergent timelines as her colleagues believed, but by deliberate institutional censorship. <words>238</words>

"Forgive me," she whispered, activating the transmitter that would broadcast the well's echoes to every capsule in the hotel. <words>257</words> Each innocent-looking coil would become a seed, carrying the forbidden tale through time as travelers returned to their respective eras. <words>282</words>

Lin felt the strange paradox of earthbound flight—the simultaneous heaviness of responsibility and lightness of liberation. <words>298</words> She understood that by morning, when supervisors discovered what she'd done, her academic career would end. <words>316</words> But some truths demanded to be freed, even at great cost. <words>327</words>

The voice from the well began to play, filling the capsule with words that had waited four centuries to be heard again. <words>352</words> Lin closed her eyes as the message spread from pod to pod, contaminating the carefully maintained historical narrative with something far more precious: truth. <words>381</words>

In the stillness of that night, as travelers slept before their tests and evaluations, an erased woman's testimony traveled across centuries, freed from the darkness of the well. <words>415</words> Lin knew that by morning, the Time Authority would trace it all back to her, but for now, she simply listened as the unspoken finally found voice. <words>447</words> Her dutiful scholarly heart had finally fulfilled its truest obligation. <words>458</words>
