Margot adjusted the leashes of her four-legged clients with practiced ease, a carefully careless gesture that belied the attention she paid to each temperamental poodle and prissy Pomeranian. <words>27</words>

The paycheck from walking dogs for Manhattan's elite afforded her a life of modest luxury, but it was the silent agreements—the unspoken exchanges of secrets overheard and confidences kept—that truly sustained her curious nature. <words>57</words>

As dusk approached, when color bled from day into night, she delivered her final furry charge to the Harrington estate, a Victorian monstrosity that neighborhood children swore devoured souls under the full moon. <words>88</words>

"Mrs. Harrington is at her botanical society meeting," the stone-faced butler informed her, sliding the dog's leash from Margot's fingers. <words>107</words>

"She requested you wait in the dining room." <words>115</words>

Margot nodded, her footsteps echoing across marble as she entered the infamous dining room where, rumor had it, old man Harrington had poisoned three business rivals during a single dinner party in 1962. <words>145</words>

The room housed Mrs. Harrington's prized botanical collection—rare orchids and carnivorous plants that thrived in glass terrariums along walls papered with faded crimson damask. <words>169</words>

It was there, among whispers of leaves and the soft tick of an ancient grandfather clock, that Margot first felt the weight of eyes upon her—eyes she couldn't see but sensed with primal certainty. <words>201</words>

She recalled meeting Mrs. Harrington at the hospital blood drive last month, how the elegant widow had studied Margot's unflinching reaction to needles before inviting her to walk little Archibald. <words>229</words>

"You don't scare easily," Mrs. Harrington had observed, her papery lips barely moving. <words>241</words>

"Some might call that an asset." <words>247</words>

Now, as shadows stretched like grasping fingers across antique silverware, Margot understood why Mrs. Harrington had chosen her—why she'd been tested. <words>269</words>

A chair scraped across the floor though no one sat in it. <words>281</words>

The chandelier swayed without breeze. <words>286</words>

Margot swallowed hard, justifying her decision to remain: the bonus Mrs. Harrington promised would cover three months' rent. <words>304</words>

The loud silence of the room pressed against her eardrums—the absence of sound somehow more deafening than noise could ever be. <words>326</words>

She watched, unflinching, as a silver serving spoon levitated from the table and tapped gently against a crystal water glass. <words>345</words>

Mrs. Harrington had not hired her to walk dogs, Margot realized—at least, not primarily. <words>360</words>

She was here to witness, to acknowledge, to stand where fear dared not tread. <words>374</words>

A napkin unfolded itself next to the elaborate place setting at the head of the table. <words>389</words>

"Good evening," Margot said to the empty chair, understanding blooming like the night-blooming cereus in the corner terrarium. <words>405</words>

"Mr. Harrington, I presume?" <words>410</words>

Sometimes the ultra-rich needed someone to walk their dogs, and sometimes—Margot settled into a chair as the ghostly dinner service began—they needed someone brave enough to dine with their dead. <words>437</words>
