Ellis Whiteclaw rolled the single dice across the chrome countertop of Stardust Diner, watching it settle on an ancient symbol instead of a number. <words>18</words> The worn bone cube had been passed down through seven generations of his family, the last keepers of Anishinaabe mechanical wisdom in this corner of the world. <words>39</words> Around him, the retro-futuristic diner hummed with synthetic coffee machines and holographic menus that flickered between images of traditional stew and lab-grown protein cubes. <words>60</words> As the settlement's most respected trapper, Ellis maintained a quiet dignity that belied his growing concern for what the coming Corporate Expansion would mean for his people's knowledge. <words>83</words>

"The hearth won't tend itself," his grandmother had told him before she passed, placing the dice in his calloused palm and binding him to his role as knowledge guardian. <words>111</words> Ellis pocketed the dice and nodded politely to Mei, the diner's owner, before stepping out into the street where the massive terraforming machines loomed on the horizon like mechanical thunderheads. <words>137</words>

His destination was the abandoned schoolhouse at the edge of town where indigenous lessons had once been taught before the Education Standardization Act. <words>158</words> The boarded windows couldn't keep him out – he'd long ago fashioned a hidden entrance using the same engineering principles his ancestors had employed to create sustainable hunting mechanisms. <words>183</words>

Inside, the walls and floor were covered with Ellis's chalk equations – seemingly chaotic scrawls that actually represented precise translations of oral traditions into mathematical formulas the new world could understand. <words>211</words> Ellis knelt in the center of the room, rolling the dice again and again, using the resulting patterns to emulate the cyclical systems his ancestors had discovered centuries before modern science caught up. <words>242</words>

The corporations thought they were innovating, but Ellis knew they were merely rediscovering. <words>254</words> Each equation he transcribed preserved another fragment – hunting cycles, weather prediction methods, sustainable harvesting techniques – all encoded in forms that could survive the coming purge of "inefficient traditional practices." <words>283</words>

Ellis worked through the night, his mechanically intuitive mind bridging ancient wisdom and futuristic application. <words>296</words> By morning, chalk dust covered his normally pristine trapping clothes, but three more knowledge systems had been preserved in the seeming disorder of his equations. <words>321</words>

Back at the Stardust, Ellis sipped synthetic coffee as news of the Corporate Expansion's final approval scrolled across the ceiling display. <words>340</words> "You look like you've been wrestling with ghosts," Mei observed, sliding a plate of real eggs toward him – a rare commodity and her way of showing respect. <words>366</words>

"Just keeping the home fires burning," Ellis replied, turning the dice over in his hand. <words>380</words> Tomorrow, the bulldozers would come for the schoolhouse, but they wouldn't find it empty – research teams from the resistance would have already documented every equation and uploaded them to the secure indigenous knowledge database. <words>417</words> Ellis smiled slightly as the dice landed on the symbol for transformation. <words>429</words> Even at the brink of change, some things could be saved, preserved in new forms but carrying the unbroken wisdom of those who had understood this land long before the first neon sign illuminated the darkness. <words>466</words>
