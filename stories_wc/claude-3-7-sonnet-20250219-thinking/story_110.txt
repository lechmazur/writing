Maeve polished the brass gears of a water clock, her fingers working with a precision that served her in more clandestine occupations after hours. <words>20</words> In the dim corner of her repair shop, a moss-covered lantern sat untouched, the only remnant of her last target who had, rather inconsiderately, recognized her before she completed the job. <words>47</words> Between assignments—these morbid chapters of her double life—she retreated to the rhythmic comfort of timepieces, where each tick aligned with her heartbeat and reminded her she was, despite everything, still alive. <words>75</words>

Her quietly flamboyant attire—subtle purple waistcoats and emerald cufflinks that caught the light just so—contrasted with her methodical demeanor, a calculated risk she took to express the self she kept submerged beneath her professional facade. <words>110</words> "Horatio adored the midnight walks with his collie," she whispered to the empty shop, penning another bleak eulogy in her leather-bound journal for the banker whose throat she had slit three nights prior. <words>140</words> "He never suspected his wife's jealousy would manifest in an envelope of cash and a stranger's blade—how domestic mysteries often end in the most predictable tragedy." <words>165</words>

The water clocks surrounding her measured moments in liquid precision, droplets falling like the tears she hadn't shed since childhood. <words>184</words> Maeve's eulogies—tucked between repair receipts and hidden in the hollowed backs of timepieces—contained coded confessions, truths about her victims that police statements would never include. <words>214</words> She had begun writing them as alibis, but they evolved into something more essential: her art. <words>230</words>

"Isn't it ridiculous," she chuckled humorlessly to a grandfather clock awaiting repair, "that I've found my literary voice through obituaries?" <words>249</words> Each meticulously crafted sentence allowed her to transmute the leaden weight of her actions into something approaching beauty—a masterpiece of regret and justification woven together. <words>275</words>

A customer's bell jingled, and Maeve slid her journal beneath a workbench, transitioning seamlessly into her shopkeeper persona. <words>293</words> "Just fixing the escapement," she explained with a smile that never reached her eyes as she handed over a repaired pocket watch to a woman whose husband's name was, coincidentally, next in her commission book. <words>324</words>

Later, alone again, she retrieved the moss-covered lantern, wiping away verdant growth to reveal inscriptions—names of those who'd commissioned her services and those she'd taken. <words>350</words> "We're all just marking time between beginnings and endings," she murmured, admiring how the rust patterns resembled bloodstains in the fading light. <words>371</words> The irony wasn't lost on her—a timekeeper who stole time from others, creating meaning from the meaningless through darkly poetic remembrances. <words>393</words> Tomorrow she would accept another assignment, start another chapter, but tonight she would complete another eulogy, finding perverse comfort in chronicling the lives she abbreviated with such professional efficiency. <words>421</words>
