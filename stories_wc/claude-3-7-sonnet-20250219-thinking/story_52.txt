Felix's fingers danced through the crowd, a ballet of theft in the time-worn marketplace nestled inside the giant hourglass. <words>20</words> The sand trickled endlessly from above, collecting into delicate dunes that reshaped the stalls and alleyways with each passing hour. <words>39</words> This was the time when chalk outlines on the ancient pathways began to blur and fade, when the merchants grew careless and the pickings were easiest. <words>62</words>

In his pocket, Felix clutched a broken pencil sharpener—the first thing he'd ever stolen, now his peculiar lucky charm. <words>80</words> Every day, he hoped this would be the one when he'd finally gather enough courage to approach her. <words>97</words>

Nadia materialized from the swirling sand veil, just as she did every evening to sell paper flowers at the north corner. <words>117</words> Her voice carried across the marketplace like a forgotten melody, rich with the tastefully offensive lyrics of old dock songs that would make sailors blush but somehow sounded like poetry when she sang them. <words>145</words>

Felix's devotion ran as deep as the hourglass was tall. <words>155</words> For three years, he had watched her, stolen for her, leaving anonymous gifts of food and coins when her stall sold poorly. <words>176</words>

"Today," he whispered to himself, turning the jagged sharpener over in his palm. <words>188</words>

The marketplace PA system crackled with the evening announcement: "Karaoke night begins in five minutes!" <words>202</words> It was the universe providing him opportunity, as rare and fleeting as the chalk lines that disappeared beneath merchants' feet. <words>220</words>

Heart thundering, Felix approached Nadia's stall. <words>226</words> "I've wanted to tell you something," he managed, offering the broken sharpener as though it were a precious gem. <words>243</words>

She looked at it curiously, then up at him with amused recognition. <words>254</words> "The boy who watches," she said with a half-smile of blithe discontent. <words>266</words>

Before he could retreat, the karaoke music began, and Nadia grabbed his wrist, pulling him toward the central square. <words>284</words> "Let's sing," she said, not a request but a command. <words>294</words>

Under the glow of paper lanterns, they stood together, microphones in hand, and as the music swelled, Felix's secret emerged through lyrics and melody. <words>317</words> He sang of the fire that had claimed her family's home three years ago, how he'd witnessed it, failed to save them, but managed to rescue just one thing—her childhood pencil sharpener. <words>347</words>

Their voices intertwined in a spontaneous duet of confession and absolution. <words>358</words> The crowd cheered, oblivious to the weight of what transpired between them. <words>371</words>

When the song ended, Nadia looked at him with eyes that held no forgiveness yet, but perhaps understanding. <words>388</words>

"I've been picking pockets to put money in yours," he admitted, as the last notes faded like chalk in rain. <words>406</words>

She laughed—a sound both beautiful and sharp. <words>413</words> "I know," she said, pocketing the broken sharpener. <words>422</words> "Keep your secrets and your stolen coins. <words>429</words> Just don't disappear like everything else in this damned hourglass." <words>440</words>

Felix nodded, his soul lighter though his future remained as uncertain as the shifting sands beneath their feet. <words>457</words>
