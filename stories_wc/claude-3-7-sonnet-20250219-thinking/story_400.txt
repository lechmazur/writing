Vaelra, the guarded druid, stood at the edge of the glacial orchard, her gnarled fingers clutching a dull safety pin—the last gift from the last human. <words>22</words>

It had been three centuries since humanity abandoned Earth for the stars, leaving behind their faithful caretakers to tend what remained. <words>43</words>

The ancient trees of the orchard hung impossibly over the yawning blue crevasse, their roots entangled with enchanted ice that never melted, bearing fruits that should not exist in such cold. <words>70</words>

Vaelra felt fiercely ambivalent about her solitude—sometimes treasuring the quiet, other times cursing the burden of memory. <words>87</words>

Today marked her seven-hundredth birthday, the day when tradition demanded she prepare the special family meal that no one would eat but her. <words>109</words>

She began to gather the frost-apples and ice-berries, careful not to look down into the endless blue depths that had swallowed her sister millennia ago. <words>133</words>

The crevasse called to her, as it always did, its siren song of vertigo that fed her crippling fear. <words>150</words>

"Not today," she whispered, breaking the silence that had reigned for decades, her voice crackling like thawing ice. <words>166</words>

With dour amusement, she noticed how the orchard seemed to shiver at the sound of her voice, as if scandalized by its presence. <words>187</words>

In her dwelling carved from a hollowed glacial boulder, Vaelra arranged the table for seven—herself and the six spirits she could never quite let go. <words>211</words>

She pinned the ancient family recipe to her sleeve with the safety pin, though she had memorized the instructions centuries ago. <words>231</words>

The preparation was elaborate: ice-berry compote simmered with ethereal fire, frost-apple pastries sculpted to resemble faces long forgotten, and fermented glacier wine that captured memories in each sip. <words>257</words>

As twilight painted the ice in lavender hues, Vaelra completed the ritual by placing a portion at each setting before sitting at the head of the table. <words>283</words>

"I miss you," she said, her words unfamiliar in her mouth after so long, "but today I must do what I have feared." <words>305</words>

After the meal, which she consumed in methodical bites while conversing with empty chairs, Vaelra approached the edge of the orchard once more. <words>327</words>

The safety pin now secured a small pouch of memorial seeds to her robe—one for each absent loved one. <words>346</words>

With deliberate movements, she lowered herself onto the crystalline ladder that spiraled down into the crevasse, each rung taking her deeper into her fear. <words>369</words>

Halfway down, when the panic threatened to overwhelm her, she allowed herself a bitter laugh that echoed against the ice walls. <words>389</words>

At the bottom, where no druid had tread since before humans walked the Earth, Vaelra planted the memorial seeds in impossibly fertile pockets of ancient soil. <words>414</words>

As she climbed back up, she felt neither triumph nor terror, but a complex peace—a new emotion to add to her fiercely ambivalent heart. <words>438</words>

The orchard would grow downward now, she thought with a hint of dour amusement, finally reclaiming what the crevasse had taken. <words>458</words>
