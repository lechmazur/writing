Cass stood atop the abandoned observatory, her drone controller useless in this medieval realm where physics seemed more suggestion than law. <words>17</words>

The dried herb bundle in her pocket—rosemary and sage bound with twine—was all she had managed to trade for with her wristwatch before the locals realized it wouldn't keep working. <words>42</words>

Below, the ancient orchard lay in dawn silence, marked with red ribbons by the baron's men who would fell it tomorrow for a new watchtower. <words>63</words>

"Quite the view to watch something die," she muttered, the cynicism that had kept her sane these three months fighting against the stubborn hope that she might actually change things here. <words>89</words>

The idea had come to her while recounting tales of her former life to amused tavernfolk—the concept of speed dating, where connections formed quickly, had fascinated them more than stories of flying cameras. <words>119</words>

So she'd claimed the crumbling observatory, perched on the cliff like a forgotten sentinel, and sent messengers to disseminate invitations throughout the valley: "Come share brief words with strangers under the stars." <words>149</words>

They came at dusk—merchants, farmers, and even the baron's daughter, slipped away in commoner's clothes—all drawn by curiosity to this strange ritual from another world. <words>173</words>

"Three minutes with each person," Cass announced, burning the herb bundle in a small brazier, its calming smoke threading through the observatory's open dome. <words>195</words>

"Speak of what matters most to you," she instructed, watching faces illuminated by candlelight, the stone walls still bearing the charred marks of the fire that had claimed this place decades ago. <words>223</words>

As villagers rotated between conversations like meticulous clockwork, something happened that Cass had gambled on—the baron's daughter sat across from the orchard keeper's son. <words>247</words>

Words passed between them like precious cargo, their expressions shifting from guarded to animated as they discovered shared love for the ancient trees and their fruit. <words>271</words>

By midnight, alliances had formed in whispered promises, plans exchanged between unlikely pairs who might never have spoken without this strange gathering. <words>291</words>

The baron's daughter stood before departing, her voice carrying across the hush: "My father will hear that these trees bear more value standing than as timber." <words>316</words>

Morning brought the baron himself to the cliff path, his daughter at his side, proclamation in hand sparing the orchard. <words>335</words>

Cass watched from the observatory's highest window, a smile forming at the corners of her mouth as workers removed red ribbons instead of trees. <words>358</words>

"Horizons of mercy," she whispered, remembering her flight instructor's words when describing how the curve of Earth always promised new possibilities beyond what you could see. <words>382</words>

Perhaps she would never return to piloting drones over deserts and mountains, but here, in this place of stone and superstition, she had learned to pilot something else—the tender, treacherous currents between despair and possibility. <words>422</words>

As sunlight filtered through the observatory's broken ceiling, casting golden geometry across the floor's constellations, Cass crushed the remaining herbs between her fingers, releasing their essence to the air. <words>450</words>

She had come to appreciate this charred serenity—this calm born from ruin, this peace built upon ashes—as she lured new futures from the brink of collective resignation. <words>478</words>

Tomorrow, she would try to explain electricity again, but today, watching villagers gather in celebration beneath the saved trees, she allowed herself to believe that some technologies—like hope—transcended worlds. <words>506</words>
