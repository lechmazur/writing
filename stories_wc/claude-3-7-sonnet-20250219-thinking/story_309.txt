Detective Reeves lingered at the Vanishing Point Gallery, his weary eyes scanning the emptiness where the stolen masterpiece once hung. <words>18</words>

The echo of police sirens had faded minutes ago, leaving behind a hush that clung to the sterile walls like stubborn guilt. <words>38</words>

"Of course they left me with this mess," he muttered, the molten sarcasm dripping from his voice as familiar as his perpetual five o'clock shadow. <words>59</words>

On the floor beneath the vacant space lay a single playing card—the Queen of Spades—its glossy surface reflecting the gallery's dim emergency lights. <words>81</words>

Reeves picked it up, confidently declaring, "This is obviously our culprit's signature," while simultaneously questioning every assumption he'd just made. <words>101</words>

He was always like this—confidently unsure—a contradiction that had both solved and prolonged cases throughout his fifteen-year career. <words>121</words>

The memory of his last failed case, another art heist where he'd arrived too late, bubbled up like acid reflux. <words>140</words>

"Not this time," he promised the empty gallery, knowing he needed to outdance the looming inevitability of the thief's next strike. <words>159</words>

Reeves began to rummage through the curator's office, pulling open drawers and rifling through files with the desperate energy of a man running out of chances. <words>184</words>

His hand closed around something unexpected—a half-damaged kaleidoscope, its brass casing dented and one end cracked. <words>202</words>

"What gallery keeps a broken toy?" he snorted, but lifted it to his eye anyway. <words>216</words>

Through the kaleidoscope's fractured lens, fleeting images danced and multiplied—fragments of paintings, security camera angles, and strangely, a recurring pattern that matched the back design of the playing card. <words>247</words>

The impact of this connection crashed into his consciousness like a freight train, unlocking memories of a case file he'd reviewed months ago. <words>270</words>

"The Kaleidoscope Killer," he whispered, memories crystallizing of a thief who left playing cards and only struck galleries with mathematical names like 'Vanishing Point'—places where perspective collapsed into singularity. <words>300</words>

The card wasn't a taunt; it was a promise of return. <words>310</words>

Through the kaleidoscope, Reeves noticed something he'd missed—a tiny alteration to the security panel, almost invisible to the naked eye. <words>331</words>

"Magnificently predictable," he said to nobody, the empty gallery absorbing his words as he realized the thief had never actually left. <words>352</words>

The stolen painting wasn't gone; it was hidden within the gallery itself, waiting for retrieval once the investigation concluded. <words>372</words>

Reeves smiled grimly, memories of all his unsolved cases flashing before him like the kaleidoscope's fragments, each failure driving him toward this moment of clarity. <words>396</words>

He pulled out his phone, called his captain, and waited in the silence that followed the final siren, knowing that for once, he wasn't too late. <words>423</words>

The Queen of Spades watched from between his fingers, a royal witness to a detective who had finally managed to see beyond the vanishing point of his own doubt. <words>450</words>
