Viola adjusted her amber earrings as the client across from her dissolved into tears, another casualty of time-crossed love. <words>18</words>

The sky reflection pool outside her office mirrored the clouds perfectly, a technological marvel designed to blur the boundary between above and below. <words>38</words>

"The gravity of desires pulls us across timelines," she explained, her voice carrying the practiced warmth that had made her the most sought-after heartbreak counselor in New Shanghai, 2187. <words>62</words>

Her restlessly curious gaze studied the man before her, cataloging his grief with clinical precision while her own secrets remained locked behind ruby-painted lips. <words>85</words>

"She simply... zipped away," he whispered, describing how his lover had purchased illegal time travel coordinates and vanished into the past. <words>105</words>

Viola nodded sympathetically, though her thoughts had already begun calculating trajectories, probabilities, solutions. <words>118</words>

"I can find her by tracking cloud trails," she offered, referring to the quantum disturbances all time travelers left behind—visible only to those with specialized training and her particular set of enhanced retinal implants. <words>148</words>

The amber earrings caught the light as she leaned forward, artifacts from her own past that she wore as both warning and trophy. <words>169</words>

What her client didn't know was that Viola had once been on the other side of this conversation—the one who abandoned, not the abandoned—before she reinvented herself as the woman who mended chronologically fractured hearts. <words>204</words>

She built this practice to proclaim herself free in a cage of illusions, convincing herself daily that helping others navigate temporal heartbreak somehow absolved her of her own transgressions. <words>233</words>

With cautious impulsiveness, she reached a decision while watching a bird dive through both the real sky and its perfect reflection. <words>251</words>

"Return tomorrow," she told her client, already planning to break every professional code she claimed to uphold. <words>267</words>

That evening, Viola remained alone beside the sky reflection pool, its engineered surface duplicating the sunset in flawless symmetry. <words>286</words>

The invention of time travel had promised humanity infinite possibilities but had instead revealed the infinite ways we could lose one another. <words>307</words>

She removed her amber earrings—relics from the lover she'd abandoned by jumping timelines—and placed them on the pool's edge. <words>327</words>

The quantum navigation device in her palm displayed the coordinates she'd extracted from her client's memories. <words>343</words>

Viola had built her reputation on never crossing the temporal lines she drew for clients, on maintaining the boundaries between past and present. <words>365</words>

But tonight, she would follow the cloud trails herself, inserting herself into this love story to satisfy her own complex design. <words>386</words>

She stepped onto the surface of the sky reflection pool, the specialized platform supporting her weight while creating the illusion she was walking on mirrored heaven. <words>410</words>

The coordinates activated, and the familiar sensation of timeline displacement began to prickle across her skin. <words>425</words>

As molecular disintegration commenced, Viola smiled, knowing this cautious plunge was neither about the client nor his lost love, but her own need to revisit the gravity of desires that kept pulling her back to her greatest mistake. <words>462</words>

The amber earrings remained behind, catching the last light of day as their owner dissolved into quantum particles, becoming as insubstantial as the reflected clouds she'd spent years learning to track. <words>495</words>
