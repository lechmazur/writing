The sentinel stood in the lighthouse keeper's bedroom, chalk in hand, as he crossed the final name off the list etched on the wall. <words>19</words>

"And that makes twenty-three," he muttered with his characteristic dry wit, feeling no triumph in completing the grim catalog of those who had perished under his watch. <words>42</words>

The frayed piece of rope that had belonged to Captain Merrill, the original keeper, still hung from the bedpost—a macabre souvenir the sentinel couldn't bring himself to discard. <words>66</words>

He had promised the Department of Coastal Affairs that he would maintain the lighthouse according to regulations, but those promises had eroded with each passing month as the peculiarities of the place demanded their own protocols. <words>100</words>

It was certainly possible that they would replace him once they discovered his unorthodox methods, but he couldn't concern himself with bureaucracy when there were ghosts to manage. <words>127</words>

The temperature dropped, and the sentinel turned to face the familiar shimmer that preceded Captain Merrill's nightly manifestation. <words>145</words>

"I've confiscated your logbook," the sentinel announced to the materializing apparition, holding up the water-damaged journal he'd found hidden beneath a floorboard. <words>169</words>

Merrill's ghost scowled, its translucent features twisting into an expression the sentinel had come to recognize over the past six months. <words>190</words>

"You won't learn the traditional methods without my cooperation," the ghost said, its voice like waves scraping against the rocky shore. <words>209</words>

The sentinel shrugged and moved toward the phonograph, placing the needle on a record that both he and the ghost knew well. <words>230</words>

"One waltz," he proposed, with the reckless precision that characterized all his negotiations with the dead, "and then you show me how to properly calibrate the lens during a storm." <words>258</words>

The ghost's form solidified at the mention of the Viennese waltz they both adored, the one passion that bridged the divide between the living and the dead in this isolated tower. <words>289</words>

As the music crackled to life, the sentinel held out his hand, and Captain Merrill's ghost obliged, cold fingers interlacing with warm ones as they moved across the creaking floorboards. <words>321</words>

The sentinel counted steps with meticulous attention while the ghost led with supernatural abandon, the names on the wall witnessing their dance—sailors lost to treacherous rocks, previous keepers driven to madness, all crossed off now. <words>357</words>

When the music stopped, the ghost honored their arrangement, beginning a detailed explanation of lens mechanics that no manual had ever documented. <words>378</words>

The sentinel listened intently, knowing these lessons—passed down through death rather than life—were his only chance of surviving the winter storms. <words>400</words>

His pencil moved with precise strokes, capturing spectral knowledge while outside, the lighthouse beam cut through fog with methodical rotation, a testament to their unlikely alliance. <words>427</words>

"Tomorrow," the sentinel said as the ghost began to fade with dawn, "we'll discuss why that piece of rope is so important to you, and why it refuses to decay despite its age." <words>457</words>

Captain Merrill's ghost smiled enigmatically before dissipating, leaving the sentinel alone with the crossed-off names, the frayed rope, and the promise of another dance when darkness fell again. <words>487</words>
