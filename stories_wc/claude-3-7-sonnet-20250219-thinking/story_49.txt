Elias had always been what the lunar colonists called a "lukewarm mage"—someone with magical abilities that never quite ignited into full potential. <words>20</words>

His spells fizzled more often than they sparked, but there was something loyally peculiar about how he kept trying, day after day, in the sterile corridors of Lunar Base Artemis. <words>43</words>

The worn metal floors beneath his feet had become familiar over the five years since Earth became uninhabitable, though he still kept a torn doormat corner from his childhood home tucked inside his pocket as a talisman. <words>76</words>

He clutched it now, feeling its frayed edges as he stood outside Commander Valencia's quarters, knowing she was moments from discovering his journal. <words>96</words>

In the hush before the revelation, time seemed suspended like the dust particles in the artificial gravity. <words>112</words>

The journal contained his greatest secret: detailed spells that could potentially terraform Earth again, magic more powerful than the colonists believed possible from someone like him. <words>135</words>

Elias closed his eyes, clinging to echoes of Earth—birdsong, ocean waves, rain against windows—sounds that the younger colonists had never known. <words>155</words>

The memory strengthened his resolve to paint a future free from fear, where humanity wasn't trapped in this metal cage suspended in the void. <words>177</words>

As the commander's hand reached for the leather-bound book, Elias pressed the doormat fragment between his palms and whispered an incantation that released a swirling stage fog throughout the corridor. <words>204</words>

"I can't let you take this from me," he said, his voice carrying a charred serenity that surprised even himself. <words>222</words>

Through the mist came Valencia and her security team, their forms reduced to ephemeral silhouettes moving like specters through the clouded air. <words>241</words>

The clash was inevitable—his minor magic against their weapons and authority—but Elias had planned for this moment since discovering the formulas. <words>262</words>

"Your spells have never worked reliably, Elias," Valencia's voice cut through the fog. <words>274</words>

"Because I never had something worth fighting for," he replied, channeling energy through the fragment of home. <words>290</words>

The silhouettes lunged toward him, but with each step, the fog reshaped their forms, turning aggression into hesitation as his spell took hold. <words>313</words>

One by one, they witnessed visions of Earth reborn—personal memories extracted and amplified through his unexpected power. <words>330</words>

Elias watched as weapons lowered and heads bowed, the fog carrying whispers of a shared homeworld across the recycled air. <words>349</words>

"We've been surviving," Elias said, stepping forward as the fog thinned. <words>360</words>

"But with these formulas, we can live again." <words>368</words>

Valencia's eyes, when they met his, held the same fire that had consumed Earth—destructive yet purifying. <words>385</words>

"You were never lukewarm," she whispered, carefully lifting the journal from her desk. <words>398</words>

Instead of opening it, she handed it back to him, a silent acknowledgment that some echoes were worth clinging to, some futures worth building together. <words>423</words>

Elias took the journal, feeling the weight of two worlds in his hands—the dead one they remembered and the living one they would create. <words>446</words>

The torn doormat corner warmed in his pocket as if it too understood: sometimes the most ordinary fragments of the past hold the most extraordinary keys to the future. <words>476</words>
