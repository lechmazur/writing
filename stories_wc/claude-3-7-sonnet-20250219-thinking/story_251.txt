Merina clutched her collection of cracked marbles, gazing at their fractured surfaces with a mixture of reverence and disdain. <words>17</words>

The lunar colony called her Prophet, though she'd never asked for the visions that came between heartbeats, glimpses of futures both terrible and sublime. <words>38</words>

Her predictions had kept the mining operation profitable, but lately, the marbles—her conduits to tomorrow—had begun to splinter, leaving her prophecies fragmented and unreliable. <words>61</words>

"Perhaps it's time," she whispered to herself, the words hanging in the recycled air of her cramped quarters carved into the moon's pale regolith. <words>83</words>

During the colony's monthly rummage sale, Merina's fingers tingled as they brushed against a discarded box containing mismatched jigsaw puzzle edges, seemingly random pieces with no whole to complete. <words>113</words>

She purchased them without explanation, ignoring the raised eyebrows of the seller who couldn't fathom why anyone would want incomplete puzzles. <words>134</words>

That night, as the artificial lights dimmed to simulate evening, Merina discovered something extraordinary—when she pressed the jagged puzzle pieces against her cracked marbles, they began to heal, their fractures sealing as though time were running backward. <words>171</words>

"I can defragment them," she realized, her heart skipping with possibilities both wondrous and terrible. <words>186</words>

With each marble she restored, Merina could see more clearly the cosmic scoreboard—the tally of lives, debts, and destinies that governed human existence beyond the thin walls of their lunar shelter. <words>217</words>

She worked through the artificial night, her fingers trembling as they matched puzzle edges to marbles in an impossible geometry that shouldn't work but did. <words>241</words>

The final marble—her favorite, swirled with blues reminiscent of Earth's vanishing oceans—revealed the colony's fate: catastrophic decompression within a week, every soul lost to the vacuum. <words>267</words>

Merina's eyes lowered bashfully as she contemplated her power, even as her spine straightened with the arrogance of one who could rewrite destiny. <words>290</words>

"By the light of distant Earth," she spoke her final oath, voice barely audible even to herself, "I scramble what has been written and accept whatever comes." <words>316</words>

Between one heartbeat and the next, she rearranged her healed marbles in a pattern only she understood, altering the cosmic ledger, exchanging her future for the colony's survival. <words>343</words>

Three days later, as miners discovered an unprecedented helium-3 deposit that would secure the colony's prosperity for generations, Merina felt the first chill of her approaching end. <words>372</words>

She smiled—a happily sad expression that confused those who noticed—knowing she had traded decades of her life for hundreds of others. <words>395</words>

The colonists never understood why their prophet began counting down days with almost mathematical precision, nor why she spent her final hours organizing her collection of now-perfect marbles. <words>424</words>

When they found her, peaceful and still, a handwritten note explained simply: "The scoreboard has been scrambled. The game continues without me." <words>446</words>

They buried her beneath lunar soil, her marbles arranged in a constellation above her grave, still glowing with prophecies that would never be spoken. <words>471</words>
