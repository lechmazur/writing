Karev slumped against the breakroom wall, his calloused fingers tracing the worn hilt of his sword. <words>14</words>

The floating rock monastery hung suspended in the endless sky, isolated from the world below just as Karev had isolated himself from feeling anything at all. <words>36</words>

He glanced at the empty chair where Elder Tomas had sat every afternoon for forty years before announcing his resignation just hours ago. <words>57</words>

"Another one gone," Karev muttered, his voice carrying the weight of his fiercely apathetic facade that had become less facade and more reality with each passing year. <words>80</words>

The plain cloth bag beside him—the one he'd kept hidden in his quarters for a decade—seemed to pulse with accusation. <words>101</words>

Inside was nothing but a child's crude star map and a letter he'd written to himself long ago, promising that he would someday find the courage to leave this place. <words>131</words>

The elders taught that those who served the monastery were blessed, but Karev knew better—they were simply afraid, as he had been. <words>153</words>

Through the small window, the first streaks of the annual meteor shower illuminated the evening sky, celestial bodies burning bright then fading, just as his resolve had done countless times before. <words>184</words>

The monastery's teachings claimed the meteors were tears of the gods, to be avoided and feared, but Karev had secretly tracked their patterns for years, noting how they always seemed to point toward the distant western isles. <words>222</words>

Tomas's resignation letter lay discarded on the table, its official seal broken—a small act of institutional defiance that had sparked something unexpected in Karev's dormant heart. <words>248</words>

With knowing naivety, he remembered his younger self who believed escape was possible, who hadn't yet learned the comfortable numbness of surrender. <words>269</words>

"Perhaps that fool was right," he whispered, reaching for the cloth bag with deliberate purpose for the first time in years. <words>288</words>

The meteor shower intensified outside, casting ethereal light across the empty breakroom where decisions were rarely made and dreams even more rarely remembered. <words>309</words>

Karev stood, bones aching from battles long past, and slung the bag over his shoulder with a decisiveness that felt foreign yet familiar. <words>332</words>

The spark of defiance that had smoldered quietly beneath his practiced apathy flared suddenly, warm and bright and impossible to ignore. <words>354</words>

He would follow the meteors—not as the monastery taught, as omens of destruction—but as guides showing him the path he'd been too tired, too afraid to take. <words>384</words>

In the silence of the abandoned breakroom, surrounded by the remnants of Tomas's departure, Karev finally allowed himself to overcome the weight of his own resignation. <words>411</words>

The sword at his hip felt lighter somehow as he walked toward the window, watching the meteors trace brilliant paths across the darkening sky. <words>434</words>

Tomorrow, while the elders performed their rituals of replacement, he would slip away, following the shower to whatever lay beyond. <words>455</words>

For now, though, Karev simply stood in quiet anticipation, a tired swordsman preparing for one final battle—not against some external foe, but against the chains he had helped forge around his own heart. <words>493</words>
