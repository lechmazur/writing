Ferris the sellsword whistled a merry tune as he patrolled the perimeter of Madame Thornwood's herb garden, his jovial demeanor at odds with the gleaming steel at his hip. <words>27</words>

The witch had hired him for a fortnight's protection while she underwent her centennial transformation, a process that required absolute tranquility for her precious herbs to absorb the metamorphic energies without contamination. <words>53</words>

"Guard with your life," she had instructed, her voice already beginning to crackle and shift like autumn leaves in a whirlwind, "but touch nothing, especially not the moonshade blossoms that treasure the night's essence." <words>79</words>

On his third evening, when purple twilight draped itself across the garden's exotic botanicals, Ferris discovered an antique astronomical telescope perched in the witch's tower window, its brass fittings gleaming with a soft, arcane luminescence. <words>109</words>

He was boldly reluctant to touch the device, remembering Madame Thornwood's warning, yet something about its intricate dials called to him like a forgotten melody. <words>133</words>

"One peek at the stars wouldn't disturb her herbs," he reasoned, adjusting the telescope toward the emerging constellation of The Oath-Keeper, a celestial pattern visible only during times of great change. <words>161</words>

Through the lens, the stars pulsed with secrets, reminding Ferris of the withering vow he'd made to his father on his deathbed—to continue their family tradition of marking life's pivotal transformations. <words>189</words>

For generations, the men of his bloodline had created time capsules during moments of profound change, sealing within them tokens that captured the essence of their metamorphosis. <words>215</words>

His father's capsule, buried beneath an old battlefield, contained the first coin he'd earned as a mercenary; his grandfather's, hidden in a mountain cave, held the quill that signed his pardon from the king's dungeon. <words>247</words>

Throughout the witch's transformation, as the garden shifted and bloomed with impossible flowers that sang harmonies in forgotten languages, Ferris found himself collecting small tokens: a perfect leaf that changed color with his mood, a vial of morning dew that never evaporated, a sketch he'd made of the dancing herbs under moonlight. <words>292</words>

Each night, he peered through the telescope, watching as the stars of The Oath-Keeper grew brighter, feeling the weight of his family's tradition press against the doubt that had long resided in his heart—the uncertainty of a sellsword's purpose beyond the next contract. <words>330</words>

On the final night of Madame Thornwood's transformation, as elegant mayhem engulfed the garden—herbs spinning in midair, forming complex patterns that rewrote the very soil's memory—Ferris completed his time capsule with a lock of his own hair and a page from the witch's grimoire that had fluttered to his feet. <words>372</words>

He buried it beneath a flowering sage plant that pulsed with golden light, its roots gently embracing the metal box in a silent promise of safekeeping. <words>397</words>

When the witch emerged at dawn, her form both familiar and wonderfully strange, she found her garden undisturbed yet enriched, and her hired sword transformed as well—his eyes now carrying the same luminescence as her telescope, his doubt dethroned by the certainty of his place in an ancient tradition. <words>440</words>

"You've done more than guard, Ferris," Madame Thornwood observed with a knowing smile that twisted like ivy up one side of her renewed face, "you've remembered who you are." <words>465</words>

"Sometimes," Ferris replied with a grin that outshone even his previous joviality, "the best treasure is the one you bury, only to find it's been inside you all along." <words>493</words>
