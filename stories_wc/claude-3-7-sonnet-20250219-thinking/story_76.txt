Finn collected dreams the way others collected stamps, quietly and with precise devotion. <words>13</words> The sleepy stablehand spent his days tending horses at the manor, but his nights belonged to the abandoned carnival ship that drifted eternally in the foggy bay. <words>38</words> He'd discovered it by accident three months ago while attending the waterfront film club that projected classics against the lighthouse wall every Thursday. <words>58</words> The brass magnifier that had belonged to his grandfather became his most treasured possession after he learned what it could do. <words>78</words>

The ship—once garish and loud with calliope music—now rested in fierce repose, its skeletal frame somehow more dignified in decay. <words>99</words> Finn navigated its tilted passages with practiced ease, shyly unstoppable in his nightly pilgrimages despite the warnings of locals who claimed the vessel was cursed. <words>123</words> He'd row out after the film club disbanded, their discussions of artistic symbolism still echoing in his mind as the mist enveloped him. <words>145</words>

What drew him back was the ship's library—water-damaged volumes that had once entertained passengers, many pages blackened by the carnival company's crude censorship of "inappropriate content." <words>171</words> Finn discovered quite by accident that when he used his brass magnifier to read random lines from these censored books, reality would warp around him. <words>193</words> The first time it happened, a sentence fragment about "moonlight dancers" caused the air above the deck to shimmer with translucent performers pirouetting through fog. <words>215</words>

Throughout that summer's film club season, Finn refined his technique. <words>225</words> "The stars cascaded like..." would bring glittering meteors streaming across the ceiling of the captain's quarters. <words>241</words> "...jungle bloomed beneath her fingertips..." transformed the rusted Ferris wheel into a flowering trellis for one magnificent hour. <words>258</words>

The warping was temporary, but Finn meticulously documented each manifestation in a journal, finding beauty in the unexpected collision of forgotten words and decaying splendor. <words>282</words> His hands perpetually smelled of horse and hay, but his mind danced with impossible geometries born from literary fragments. <words>301</words>

On the final night of the autumn film festival, as the club screened "Nosferatu" on the shore, Finn made his most daring combination yet. <words>324</words> Three books, three random lines, read simultaneously through the magnifier's golden eye. <words>336</words> The carnival ship's ruins transformed completely—not restored to its original state, but reborn as something neither fully real nor fantasy. <words>357</words>

Dawn found him sleeping on the deck, the magnifier clutched to his chest, his face serene yet somehow fierce in its contentment. <words>378</words> The horses would wonder why their keeper moved so slowly that day, his mind still half-caught in the warped reality he'd created. <words>400</words> But Finn had discovered what he sought—that beauty existed not despite destruction but sometimes because of it, flourishing in the margins of censored dreams and abandoned revelry. <words>426</words>
