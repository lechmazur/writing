Marcus drifted to the Pendleton Tidal Power Monitoring Station the same way he'd drifted through casinos—following whispers of opportunity with pockets emptier than his understanding of odds. <words>24</words>

The isolation suited him, as did the station's frequent power fluctuations that transformed ordinary dinners into candlelit affairs where time seemed suspended between the rhythmic pulse of waves against the facility's massive turbines. <words>47</words>

"You've never seen real darkness until you've been thirty miles offshore during a system failure," Dr. Harlow announced during Marcus's first blackout dinner, the old physicist's face transformed into a landscape of shadows by the flickering flames. <words>73</words>

Marcus learned that Dr. Harlow had once held a prestigious university position before his theories about energy conservation and quantum probability became too radical, earning him the reputation of being brilliant but unhinged. <words>99</words>

The staff endured these impromptu lectures with the patience of those who had long ago accepted eccentricity as the toll for brilliance, but Marcus found himself captivated by Harlow's rarely predictable tangents about how the universe operates on unseen wagers. <words>130</words>

During his third month at the station, while exploring a storage room for spare parts, Marcus discovered a box containing rustic candle molds, their wooden forms carved with intricate wave patterns that mirrored the tides churning below the station. <words>162</words>

"Those belonged to Elliot, the previous maintenance manager," Dr. Harlow explained, eyes gleaming with something between mischief and melancholy. <words>177</words>

"He believed each candle captured a fragment of light to bargain with darkness—poetic nonsense, of course, but the universe runs on unspoken bargains, doesn't it?" <words>198</words>

Marcus began making candles, finding in their creation a meditation that gambling had never provided, each pour of wax an act of creation rather than chance. <words>221</words>

The midnight lectures expanded to include the philosophy of light and time, with Dr. Harlow growing more animated as supply ships docked with decreasing frequency, isolating them further as winter approached. <words>248</words>

"We're all trying to capture one last spark before oblivion," Dr. Harlow declared one night, his voice cracking with emotion as he gestured toward the horizon where the beam from their lighthouse cut through fog. <words>276</words>

Marcus found himself laughing through tears when Dr. Harlow demonstrated how probability worked by blindfolding himself and attempting to navigate the dining room, knocking over chairs while delivering an impassioned lecture on chaos theory. <words>302</words>

The candles Marcus crafted became central to their dinner rituals, each one burning with a steadiness that contradicted the turbulent seas surrounding them and the turbulent thoughts within him. <words>327</words>

When the spring supply vessel finally managed to dock after weeks of storms, Marcus surprised himself by declining passage back to the mainland, instead handing the captain a carefully wrapped package of candles for delivery to his estranged daughter. <words>359</words>

"An unspoken bargain with yourself," Dr. Harlow nodded approvingly, understanding before Marcus could explain. <words>371</words>

Later that night, as they sat down to another candlelit dinner and Dr. Harlow prepared to launch into an especially rebellious lecture involving quantum entanglement and human connection, Marcus realized that in this remote place, amid the endless monitoring of nature's power, he had somehow found something gambling never offered—not the thrill of winning, but the peace of belonging. <words>424</words>

"To last sparks and new beginnings," Marcus proposed a toast, the candlelight catching in the tears of laughter that formed as Dr. Harlow began an especially animated demonstration of wave-particle duality using dinner rolls as quantum particles. <words>454</words>

In the gentle glow of his own created light, with the tides surging predictably below while their conversations flowed with beautiful unpredictability above, Marcus recognized that he had finally placed a bet worth making. <words>484</words>
