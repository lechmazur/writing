Michael Thorne, once a conscientious objector who refused to bear arms during the war, now patrolled the hanging orchards with nothing more dangerous than a flashlight and a rusty nail he used as a makeshift pointer. <words>33</words>

The neighborhood watch had been his idea, born from the boredom of retirement and the suspicious movements he'd observed in the storm-battered ravine where the old fruit trees clung precariously to eroded slopes. <words>63</words>

Throughout the autumn craft fairs that drew tourists to their small town, he maintained his vigil, valiantly battling the tedium of his self-appointed duty while maintaining meticulous records of all he observed. <words>92</words>

"Welcome to Ravenhollow," he would greet the occasional hikers who strayed from the main paths, his xenial smile never quite reaching his eyes as he offered them fresh fruit and directions back to town. <words>121</words>

What none of them knew was that the Thorne family had maintained a tradition for generations: during the Harvest Moon festival, they would document the movements of birds, animals, and now people, creating intricate maps of migration routes through their valley. <words>153</words>

Michael's grandfather had started the practice to aid conservationists, but over decades, the family's intentions had shifted toward a more selective form of conservation. <words>176</words>

The rusty nail that Michael carried had once secured the door of the old meeting house where unwanted "migrants" had been locked away during his grandfather's time. <words>201</words>

Each night after his patrol, Michael would return to his cluttered study and add new pins to his enormous wall map, documenting the comings and goings of strangers with a coy smile that belied his true purpose. <words>234</words>

The ravine, with its twisted trees and shadow-filled corners, kept its secrets well, as did the Thorne family, who had long ago appointed themselves guardians of who could stay and who must leave. <words>266</words>

When visitors commented on the beautiful orchard surviving despite the brutal storms that regularly swept through the ravine, Michael would nod knowingly and attribute it to "proper pruning." <words>293</words>

The craft fairs brought new faces each weekend—artists, food vendors, and tourists—all potential additions to his elaborate mapping system and, perhaps, candidates for the ravine's deeper purpose. <words>321</words>

Michael sometimes wondered if his conscientious objection to military service had merely been his mind's way of preserving his capacity for violence for a more personal cause. <words>347</words>

He found a certain satisfaction in his role as protector of the valley's "ecological balance," a phrase he used often in the neighborhood watch meetings when proposing new surveillance routes. <words>377</words>

The other watch members saw him as dedicated if somewhat overzealous, never suspecting that behind his hospitality lurked a generational malevolence cloaked in tradition. <words>402</words>

As another storm approached and the craft fair vendors secured their tents for the night, Michael marked three new paths on his map with dots of red ink, humming the harvest song his grandfather had taught him, content in knowing that some traditions never die, they merely adapt. <words>445</words>
