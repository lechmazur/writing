Marcus believed he had once been a goldfish—it explained his obsessive need to care for the thirty-seven shimmering creatures that now inhabited the forgotten recipe library where he worked. <words>30</words>

In his previous life, he'd been neglected, left gasping at the bottom of a filthy tank, and now guilt's haunting echo followed him whenever a fish fell ill. <words>54</words>

The one-armed toy soldier perched atop the circulation desk was his talisman, a childhood relic he'd damaged in a fit of rage decades ago. <words>73</words>

Marcus moved through the dusty shelves of ancient cookbooks with tentatively fierce determination, as if his carefully curated fish habitats might compensate for past sins while he simultaneously feared the judgment of others. <words>98</words>

When Dr. Harlow had scheduled his follow-up appointment, Marcus knew the charts would likely confirm what they both suspected—his condition wasn't improving. <words>117</words>

The library itself was a relic, housing recipes nobody consulted anymore—a perfect sanctuary for a man who found human interaction painful and fish communication soothing. <words>138</words>

Every Tuesday, per century-old tradition, the library board members performed a ceremonial reading of the oldest cookbook in the collection, a practice Marcus had always found absurdly pointless. <words>160</words>

A sudden thunderstorm rattled the library's windows that afternoon, driving in an unexpected visitor who shook rainwater from her umbrella and headed straight for the neglected Caribbean cuisine section. <words>182</words>

"Those recipes haven't been touched in decades," Marcus called out, his voice carrying the playful cynicism he reserved for rare human interactions. <words>200</words>

The woman turned, her face lighting with recognition. "You're the fish guy! My daughter told me about you—she had a goldfish funeral last year and said you helped her understand the circle of life." <words>230</words>

The memory flooded back—the little girl with pigtails who had cried over her dead pet, whom Marcus had consoled by explaining his reincarnation theory. <words>249</words>

As lightning cracked outside, Marcus felt something alleviate within him—the constant pressure of his guilt slightly lifting. <words>264</words>

Over tea brewed from an 18th-century recipe, they talked about traditions worth keeping and those begging to be disrupted, including the board's tedious cookbook readings. <words>285</words>

"Those old men need new ideas more than they need old recipes," she laughed, tapping the toy soldier's head affectionately. <words>302</words>

Her touch made the soldier wobble, nearly toppling it from its perch, and Marcus's hand shot out with surprising quickness to steady it. <words>320</words>

"Sorry about that," she said, noticing his attachment to the damaged toy. <words>330</words>

"He reminds me that broken things still have purpose," Marcus replied, his fingers trailing over the missing limb. <words>345</words>

Together they drafted a proposal to transform the Tuesday readings into community cooking classes, where forgotten recipes could come alive again instead of being merely recited. <words>368</words>

"It's strange," she mused, watching the goldfish swim lazy circles in their tanks, "how a rainstorm can wash away years of doing things the same way." <words>391</words>

The next morning, before heading to his appointment where Dr. Harlow's charts awaited, Marcus slipped the one-armed soldier into his pocket—a reminder that even in his tentatively fierce second life, he too still had purpose. <words>424</words>
