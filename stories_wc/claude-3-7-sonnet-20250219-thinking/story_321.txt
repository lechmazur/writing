Marcos stood at his post in the infernal kitchen, his eyes wandering from the bubbling cauldrons of despair to the charred cookbooks of regret. <words>19</words> Heat rolled through the brimstone-scented space as damned souls simmered in their own remorse, their whispers forming a backdrop of tortured white noise that Marcos had learned to ignore. <words>44</words> The distracted guard's attention drifted yet again to Eliza, who methodically chopped memory-root at the far counter, her back rigid with unacknowledged hurt since their argument three eternities ago. <words>70</words>

In his pocket, Marcos fingered the partial spool of ribbon he'd found in her quarters—crimson like her favorite shade, salvaged from the incinerator after his careless words had driven her to burn every gift he'd given her. <words>104</words> The price of forgiveness seemed steeper with each passing moment, hanging in the air between them like the acrid smoke that curled from beneath the massive iron doors. <words>131</words>

An almost radical thought struck him as he watched the ancient hourglass on the wall—its sand neither falling nor rising but swirling in dreamlike patterns that reflected the temporal distortions of the underworld. <words>162</words> If he could interpret those patterns, perhaps he could displace the moment of their fracture, reach back across the void to before his betrayal. <words>184</words>

During the midnight rotation, when the screams subsided to whimpers, Marcos approached the hourglass with trembling hands. <words>201</words> He pressed the ribbon against the glass, watching as its color seemed to seep into the swirling sands, clarifying the chaotic patterns into recognizable moments—their first meeting, their hundredth kiss, the exact instant his careless words sliced through her trust. <words>242</words>

The kitchen's eternal flames flickered as reality shifted, time folding around him in the space where an apology waited unspoken. <words>262</words> With abrasive calm, he traced the ribbon's path through the clarified sands, his finger following the thread of possibility until he found the moment he sought. <words>290</words>

"To outmaneuver cosmic silence," the ancient text had said, "one must sacrifice what is most precious in the moment of clarity." <words>312</words> Marcos understood now as the ribbon dissolved completely, its essence transferring his current consciousness backward through the hourglass. <words>330</words>

He awoke at his post, the argument not yet happened, Eliza smiling as she approached. <words>345</words> The memory of a future that would never be pressed against his skull—the price of his forgiveness was remembering alone. <words>366</words>

"You seem different today," Eliza said, her eyes still trusting, still warm. <words>378</words>

"I had a revelation about us," Marcos replied, the weight of unwritten histories heavy on his tongue. <words>395</words> "About how easily we break what matters most, and how impossible it is to truly mend without giving up something equal in return." <words>418</words>

In the distance, the hourglass resumed its inscrutable swirling, now containing a single thread of crimson, forever displacing the moment where they had fallen apart. <words>445</words>
