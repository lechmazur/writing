Eliza kneaded dough with flour-dusted hands, her bakery's basement hiding the emergency time machine garage where she'd spent her nights since the shadows began to whisper. <words>24</words> Her cynically gentle demeanor had served her well, allowing townsfolk to dismiss her as merely eccentric while she secretly worked against Governor Thornfield, whose reign had darkened their once-peaceful valley. <words>49</words> The tyrant's latest decree had banned moongazing, a seemingly arbitrary law until Eliza noticed how the shadows grew more articulate during certain lunar phases. <words>70</words>

"The seeds spread when moonlight touches water," a particularly bold shadow had told her three weeks ago, sliding across her collection of pressed flowers—violet anemones, sage, and bloodroot—that she used to mark her lunar charts. <words>99</words> Governor Thornfield wasn't just a power-hungry politician; he was deliberately contaminating the reservoir during specific moon phases, releasing spores that made citizens complacent and worshipful. <words>122</words>

Eliza had discovered the pattern by meticulously tracking the moon's waxing and waning alongside reports of unusual devotion to Thornfield. <words>140</words> The pressed flowers, gifts from travelers passing through different timestreams, contained temporal properties that allowed her to verify lunar positions across multiple realities and confirm the connection. <words>164</words>

"You'll need to exceed the machine's parameters," advised the shadow cast by her rolling pin. <words>177</words> "Travel not just through time but through lunar positions." <words>186</words>

Eliza calibrated the emergency time machine—technically reserved for catastrophic timeline fractures—using the pressed flowers as organic anchors to specific lunar moments. <words>205</words> The shadows guided her hands as she adjusted forgotten dials and bypassed safety protocols that had prevented previous travelers from directly influencing celestial alignments. <words>226</words>

When the machine's door finally opened, Eliza stepped through with her basket of specially prepared moon-cakes, each containing an antidote she'd developed from the same pressed flowers that had revealed the pattern. <words>254</words> She emerged at the reservoir one month prior, just as Thornfield conducted his midnight contamination ritual beneath the crescent moon. <words>273</words>

"Your reign ends tonight," Eliza announced, her shadow stretching impossibly across the water's surface, speaking with a thousand voices. <words>290</words> Thornfield's eyes widened at the baker whose reputation he'd dismissed, never suspecting she'd unravel his scheme. <words>306</words>

By dawn, the water ran clear, Eliza's moon-cakes distributed throughout town neutralized the contagion, and the shadows celebrated with whispered songs. <words>325</words> The time machine garage, its emergency status deactivated, became simply another storage room in Eliza's expanding bakery. <words>342</words>

Travelers still brought her pressed flowers from distant times and places, and she welcomed them with freshly baked bread and a smile that remained cynically gentle—knowing that power, like dough, required watchful eyes to prevent it from rising too much. <words>377</words> The shadows continued to speak, softer now but ever vigilant, reminding Eliza that some seeds of tyranny remain dormant, waiting for the right moon phase to germinate once more. <words>407</words>
