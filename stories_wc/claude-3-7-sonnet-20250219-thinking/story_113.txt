Taren clutched his worn-out dinosaur plush against his chest as he navigated the xenon-lit tunnel, the blue-white glow casting shadows that danced like memories across the curved walls. <words>27</words>

The dream-hopping machines hummed in their alcoves, ready for the midnight crossing when the old year—one that had brought plague, conflict, and heartache to so many—would finally end. <words>50</words>

As the hesitant bard of the Temporal Waystation, Taren was tasked with motivating travelers to release their sorrows before stepping into the new year, though he found it difficult to raise his voice above a whisper when not performing. <words>83</words>

"Your burdens are but threads in time's great tapestry," he announced in his peculiar way—shyly loud—his voice somehow reaching every corner of the tunnel while his eyes remained fixed on his dinosaur, Rex, whom he'd carried since childhood. <words>123</words>

The irony wasn't lost on Taren that he, who could barely introduce himself at parties, was responsible for guiding strangers through their most intimate pains. <words>146</words>

Dream-hopping was an ancient art, allowing the practitioner to slip into the nightmares of others and transform them, but it required absolute vulnerability from both parties. <words>172</words>

"Please, connect to your designated machine and prepare for temporal transition," Taren said, his voice an odd mixture of thunder and hesitation, as travelers attached neural links to their temples. <words>200</words>

Each year's crossing was the same—people desperate to forget, to unravel the tapestry woven from their collective sorrow—yet Taren knew better than most the fragility of time, how it folded upon itself, how patterns repeated. <words>241</words>

As the countdown began, Taren activated his own dream-hopper, feeling the familiar vertigo as his consciousness catapulted into the shared dreamscape of those in the tunnel. <words>267</words>

Within the dream, he stood on a vast plain where fragments of the past year hung like shattered glass in the air, each reflecting moments of grief, of loss, of regret. <words>297</words>

"Time isn't a straight line to be escaped," Taren sang, his music flowing through the dreamscape, "but a circle to be honored." <words>318</words>

With each note, he watched in ironic awe as travelers reached out, touching their sorrows, accepting them as part of their journey rather than baggage to be abandoned. <words>346</words>

Rex, somehow present in this shared dream, glowed with the wisdom of ages, reminding them all that even the mightiest creatures eventually became nothing more than loving memories. <words>374</words>

As the final seconds of the reviled year ticked away, Taren guided the dreamers to weave their sorrows back into a single tapestry—not to forget, but to remember with newfound strength. <words>405</words>

The dream-hoppers disengaged with the strike of midnight, leaving travelers dazed but lighter, many nodding thankfully to the bard who, already shrinking back into his shell, offered a barely audible "Happy New Year" while hugging his dinosaur tight. <words>446</words>

In the empty tunnel, Taren allowed himself a small smile—another year crossed, another tapestry preserved instead of unwound, another reminder that in the grand scheme of existence, even our deepest sorrows are but beautiful, necessary threads in the fabric of time. <words>491</words>
