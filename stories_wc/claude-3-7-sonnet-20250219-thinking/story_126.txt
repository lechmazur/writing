Tarrin stared at the artificial stars from the space station observation deck, the rustic butter churn cradled absently in his arms. <words>18</words>

Three decades as a merchant traversing the solar system had left him with nothing but this antique and the knowledge that burned inside him since the shipwreck. <words>42</words>

The butter churn, carved from the wood of Earth's final forest, was honestly strange in this sterile metal environment—an anachronism that now represented humanity's lost connection to its origin planet. <words>69</words>

It had been exactly fifty years since the last tree fell, since the final gasps of Earth's ecosystem had been broadcast across the colonies. <words>91</words>

"They lied to us all," Tarrin whispered, his voice carrying an aloof passion that belied his trembling hands. <words>108</words>

The observation deck was empty this cycle, as it always was when the commemorative holos of Old Earth played for the dwindling audience of nostalgic colonists. <words>131</words>

Tarrin approached the curved viewport where a faded travel poster clung to the wall—"Visit Earth's Majestic Forests"—its edges flaking away to reveal something beneath that no one else had noticed. <words>158</words>

Rebellious sparks of energy danced along the poster's deteriorating border, visible only to those who knew to look, who had glimpsed the code behind the simulation. <words>181</words>

He pressed the butter churn against the sparking edge of the poster, watching as ancient wood met quantum glitch, creating a resonance that rippled through the air. <words>203</words>

The churn began to hum with accumulated data, memories of real trees, real earth, real sky—truths embedded in its grain by someone who had known what was coming. <words>227</words>

Tarrin had crossed half the solar system with this knowledge, survived the planned destruction of his ship, all to reach this precise spot where the grand illusion was thinnest. <words>253</words>

With methodical precision, he began turning the churn's handle, each rotation sending more rebellious sparks flowing from the poster onto the observation deck's floor. <words>274</words>

"The stars aren't really there," he explained to the empty room, "none of this is." <words>289</words>

The artificial gravity wavered as the sparks multiplied, revealing glimpses of code and framework behind the illusion of reality. <words>307</words>

Tarrin felt his consciousness begin to ascend via the flaking edges of the travel poster, the butter churn now glowing with accumulated energy. <words>327</words>

His body remained on the observation deck, but his mind pushed through the tear in reality, determined to shatter the grand illusion that humanity had been living in since long before the last tree fell. <words>357</words>

Beyond the veil, he saw the truth—there was no space station, no colonies, no stars. <words>372</words>

Only a dying Earth, a desperate experiment, and billions of minds trapped in a simulation designed to preserve humanity's sanity as the real world faded away. <words>396</words>

The butter churn in his hands disintegrated into light as the system recognized the intrusion, but it was too late—Tarrin had set the sequence in motion. <words>419</words>

Around him, the observation deck began to dissolve, pixel by pixel, as the grand illusion shattered and the last merchant prepared to deliver his final, most valuable commodity: the truth. <words>447</words>
