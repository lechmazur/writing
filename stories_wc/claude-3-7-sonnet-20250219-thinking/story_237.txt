Elara Voss, brilliant psychic genealogist to the stars, rolled the ancient dice across the metal floor of the space pirate brig. <words>21</words> The chipped one always landed on her ancestors' secrets. <words>30</words> "Funny how destiny works," she murmured, studying the numbers with eyes that saw beyond bloodlines. <words>44</words> The pirates had caught her scanning family trees without a license, though her real crime was discovering their captain descended from Earth's most notorious traitor. <words>67</words> Elara's proudly humble demeanor had kept her alive thus far. <words>77</words> "I'm just a humble reader of genetic whispers," she'd told them when captured, downplaying abilities that had tracked hereditary crimes across twelve galaxies. <words>98</words>

From beneath her cot, she retrieved the stack of weathered diaries she'd collected from abandoned bullet trains throughout the Orion Arm—the peculiar place where the heartbroken of the universe left their stories before disappearing. <words>129</words> Reading them had been her way to quiet her own heartbreak after Marcos left, taking their shared future but leaving his genetic imprint on her soul. <words>152</words> Each morning when the last star faded into daylight, the brig's forcefield weakened just enough. <words>166</words> This was her chance. <words>170</words>

Elara had spent weeks piecing together the puzzle—how the bloodlines connected, how the diaries revealed patterns of a cosmic conspiracy. <words>188</words> She needed to lengthen the forcefield disruption by precisely 3.7 seconds to escape. <words>201</words> She rolled the dice again carefully. <words>207</words> The chipped one landed on six—her signal. <words>215</words> "My ancestors were timesmith engineers," she said with grave playfulness to the empty cell. <words>228</words> "And so, apparently, were yours, Captain." <words>234</words>

The revelation had shaken her deeply: the pirate captain who imprisoned her shared her great-great-grandmother. <words>249</words> The diaries had confirmed it—a family secret spanning centuries. <words>258</words> Footsteps approached as morning's light replaced the stars. <words>266</words> Elara whispered to the dice, channeling her psychic energy through genetic memory. <words>278</words> The forcefield's hum deepened, stretched, lengthened. <words>285</words>

The captain appeared, face half-shadowed. <words>291</words> "The stars say you're planning something." <words>297</words> "Just connecting dots," Elara replied, holding up a diary. <words>306</words> "Did you know your grandmother left this on the Tokyo-Kyoto bullet train in 2089? She knew we would meet someday." <words>325</words> The captain's hand trembled on the weapon. <words>332</words> "Impossible." <words>333</words>

"Destiny isn't a straight line, Captain. It's a puzzle we assemble across generations." <words>346</words> As she spoke, Elara sensed their shared genetic memory awakening in the captain too—the final piece she needed to hush the alarm bells of her broken heart. <words>370</words> The forcefield dissolved completely. <words>374</words> "You could have escaped," the captain said, holstering the weapon. <words>384</words> Elara smiled, rolling the dice one final time. <words>392</words> "Sometimes family is the only escape we need." <words>400</words>
