Elliot descended through the murky depths, his welding equipment heavy against the underwater current, thoughts drifting to the vintage button box waiting in his locker topside. <words>23</words>

Each brass button, inherited from his grandmother, corresponded to a different celestial body in the old planetarium where she once worked as an astronomer before it shuttered and reopened as Cosmos, the city's most exclusive nightclub. <words>62</words>

The box had come to him in a peculiar way, recovered during a salvage operation on a sunken yacht that, according to maritime records, shouldn't have existed for another fifteen years. <words>91</words>

Patiently impatient, Elliot had spent months deciphering his grandmother's journals, methodically testing each button while observing their effects in the antique mirrors he'd collected from vintage stores across the city. <words>122</words>

Through fractured reflections, he had witnessed fragments of other lives, other possibilities—glimpses of timelines that ran parallel to his own. <words>142</words>

Tonight was the convergence, a rare astronomical alignment his grandmother's calculations predicted would happen once every seventy-three years, when the boundaries between what was and what could be grew paper-thin. <words>172</words>

Elliot finished his underwater repair job with unusual haste, the ordinarily meticulous welder cutting corners to ensure he wouldn't miss his window of opportunity. <words>195</words>

Inside Cosmos, the shattered dome of the former planetarium had been repurposed with disco balls and laser lights that mimicked stars and nebulae, the scientific precision of the original replaced by approximated wonder. <words>229</words>

He positioned himself beneath the central mirror ball, its hundreds of facets creating a kaleidoscope of reflections, and removed the button box from his jacket pocket. <words>254</words>

The club's patrons danced obliviously around him, pampering themselves with overpriced cocktails and the illusion of celestial communion, unaware of the true cosmic event unfolding in their midst. <words>283</words>

Elliot felt the box grow warm in his palm as the clock approached midnight, the moment his grandmother had described as "the crossing where two timelines should never meet." <words>313</words>

His fingers hovered over the Neptune button—the one she had explicitly warned never to press during a convergence. <words>332</words>

The inherited mystery of his grandmother's warnings competed with his desire to wield improbable power, to bend reality as she claimed was possible during this astronomical alignment. <words>357</words>

In the surrounding mirrors, Elliot caught glimpses of himself in different lives: commanding oceans, speaking to stars, healing the planet's wounds—all versions of himself that could be if he dared to press that forbidden button. <words>392</words>

As midnight struck, he made his choice, pressing firmly on Neptune's worn brass face, feeling the universe begin its unraveling around him as timelines collided like waves against a shore. <words>422</words>

The button box vibrated violently, its ancient mechanism awakening fully for the first time in generations, transforming the nightclub's artificial constellation into a gateway between worlds that were never meant to touch. <words>452</words>

And as reality frayed at its edges, Elliot realized why his grandmother had hidden the box away—not to prevent him from accessing its power, but to protect him from becoming exactly what he now witnessed in every surrounding mirror: the architect of cosmic collapse and rebirth. <words>497</words>
