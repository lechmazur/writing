Marshall wiped down the makeshift bar counter inside the abandoned carnival ticket booth, his permanently downturned mouth matching the faded clown paintings that still clung to the walls. <words>27</words>

The night air hung still around the converted booth, a stillness that emerged only in those rare moments when adversaries silently agree to pause their battles. <words>50</words>

Marshall's fingers traced the edge of his worn wallet, the leather cracked from years of opening it to find less than he'd hoped. <words>71</words>

His gruff demeanor and caustic wit somehow drew patrons to him rather than repelling them—an abrasively charming presence in this forgotten corner of the fairgrounds. <words>94</words>

The broken payphone booth adjacent to his bar stood like a confessional, its cord dangling uselessly while still somehow collecting the whispered secrets of those who believed their words traveled through disconnected wires. <words>124</words>

"Same as always?" Marshall asked the woman who appeared at his counter, her features familiar yet impossible to place in any specific memory. <words>144</words>

The distant drone of cicadas mingled with carnival music that hadn't actually played in decades, yet seemed to filter through the cracks in reality around them. <words>167</words>

Marshall had learned to listen to the payphone, to catch fragments of confessions that slipped between worlds—echoes from alternate timelines where the carnival still thrived, where his life had taken different turns. <words>197</words>

His patrons never questioned the mismatched glasses or how the lights sometimes flickered to reveal different versions of the same space; they simply accepted this pocket of in-between as shelter from their own transient realities. <words>229</words>

Every night at midnight, darkness swallowed the faint glow that outlined the edges of the ticket booth, leaving them all momentarily blind to which version of themselves they might become when vision returned. <words>259</words>

Marshall served drinks before midnight and memories after, collecting payment in currencies both tangible and not, all to fund his true purpose. <words>280</words>

The woman sipped her amber liquid, eyes reflecting knowledge of Marshall's quest to reclaim the light that midnight stole—the luminescence that could stabilize this fracturing pocket of existence. <words>306</words>

"I heard something interesting tonight," Marshall said, nodding toward the payphone booth where impossible conversations leaked through the receiver. <words>324</words>

There was something in the way strangers recognized each other here without introductions, a sense of enigmatic familiarity that suggested they'd met in countless variations of their lives. <words>350</words>

Marshall's customers drifted in and out like spectral visitors, but they all served his purpose, each carrying fragments of light that midnight had scattered across countless parallel carnivals. <words>377</words>

He collected these fragments in his worn wallet, between credit cards that worked in worlds that no longer existed and identification for people he had almost become. <words>402</words>

The woman finished her drink as the air grew heavier with approaching midnight, her fingers leaving behind a sliver of light that Marshall quickly pocketed. <words>426</words>

"Almost enough," he murmured, feeling the weight of collected luminescence warm against his chest, perhaps finally sufficient to stitch their fraying reality back into something whole. <words>450</words>

The carnival music stuttered as midnight approached, the signal that their fragile truce with darkness would soon be tested once again. <words>469</words>

Marshall closed his wallet, patted it once, and prepared to fight for permanence in a world where everything—including himself—was merely passing through. <words>490</words>
