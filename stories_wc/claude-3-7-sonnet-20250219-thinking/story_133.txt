Vincent, the locksmith, peered through the canopy of apple trees as twilight began to permeate the labyrinth orchard sprawling across the colonial rooftops. <words>20</words>

His calloused fingers, once nimble enough to pick any lock in Westford, now ached from the pottery wheel he'd reluctantly attended that morning. <words>40</words>

The embroidered gloves lay beside him on the weathered bench, their golden thread catching the last light of day, tiny crowns and hunting falcons revealing a heritage he'd long denied. <words>64</words>

"A throne remains unclaimed," whispered Madame Eleanor earlier that day, her pottery-stained hands deliberately brushing against his as she helped him center his clay. <words>86</words>

Her words had followed him home, clinging to his thoughts with delightfully menacing persistence, like ivy strangling stone. <words>102</words>

Vincent had recognized her immediately despite her humble disguise—the royal falconer's daughter, now grown, with the same knowing eyes that had watched him flee the palace fifteen years ago. <words>130</words>

He resumed painting the small ceramic box he'd thrown in class, each brushstroke deliberate, the traditional hunting scenes of his ancestors taking form beneath his careful hand. <words>155</words>

The ancient methods of falcon training, bow hunting, and tracking had been his family's pride for centuries before the coup—techniques that would die with him if he continued this charade of commoner life. <words>185</words>

Vincent's jaw tightened as he worked crimson paint into the wing of a falcon, recalling how these very orchards, planted by loyalists generations ago, formed a secret map visible only from the castle towers. <words>215</words>

He had built locks for nearly every door in this town, knowing each resident's secrets while keeping his own buried beneath layers of practiced indifference. <words>238</words>

The pottery class had been a calculated risk—information suggesting Eleanor would be there had drawn him like a moth to flame. <words>258</words>

With demure audacity, she had slipped him a key inside her demonstration piece, a key he now turned over in his palm, its weight both burden and birthright. <words>283</words>

Below, the town's evening lamps flickered on, casting elongated shadows that danced between fruit trees like conspiring courtiers. <words>299</words>

Vincent slid the embroidered gloves onto his hands, their perfect fit a confirmation he could no longer deny. <words>315</words>

The last rays of sunlight caught the secret insignia woven into his pottery box—a signal that would summon those still loyal to the old ways, to the hunting traditions that bound nobility to land. <words>345</words>

Tomorrow he would return to the pottery class, fingers stained with paint and clay instead of metal filings, and begin the slow work of reclaiming what was lost. <words>369</words>

His practiced locksmith's smile—just pleasant enough to be forgettable—would serve him well as plans unfolded. <words>384</words>

The moon rose higher, illuminating the fruit-laden paths that twisted and turned like the lineage of kings, and Vincent knew that true labyrinths existed not just in orchards, but in the tangled loyalties of those who remembered the rightful heir. <words>424</words>

He closed the pottery box with a soft click, a sound not unlike the tumblers of a lock falling into place. <words>442</words>

In time, the kingdom's mechanisms would align just as precisely under his touch—a jaded locksmith no more, but a hunter reclaiming his territory with the patient precision of one who knows that every door, eventually, must open. <words>477</words>
