Masood, a weary undertaker, traced his fingers along the brass meridians of the astronomical clock that dominated the central hall of the reimagined Persian palace. <words>21</words> The ancient timepiece, salvaged from the ruins of Isfahan and restored within this modern interpretation of Darius's home, was both his burden and salvation. <words>42</words> Outside, the rumble of modern Tehran pressed against the alabaster walls, an uncomfortable reminder of the world that had forgotten what Masood's ancestors knew. <words>63</words>

A car backfired in the silent street below, and in the hush that followed, Masood felt time suspend itself like dust motes in a shaft of light. <words>88</words> His grandfather's tribal knowledge, passed down through seventeen generations of palace undertakers, stirred within him – rarely practical in this age of digital cremations and assembly-line burials, yet vital in ways the modern world couldn't comprehend. <words>122</words>

The clock's golden discs shifted imperceptibly as the sun crept across the sky, aligning with ancient calculations that had mapped the heavens long before telescopes pierced the veil of night. <words>152</words> Each constellation, each planetary transit, told Masood when a soul might slip its earthly tether – knowledge that had once made his family revered, now made them relics. <words>180</words>

"The dead have patience," his father had taught him, with that placid ferocity that characterized their line, "but darkness does not." <words>200</words> Masood understood now, as he aligned the clock's intricate gears by following the sun paths etched into the marble floor, illuminated one by one as daylight progressed. <words>228</words>

Today, he would imprison grief itself. <words>234</words> The palace had been commissioned by a tech billionaire who had lost his daughter and sought to trap death within the astronomical precision of ancient Persian cosmology. <words>259</words> Masood knew better – death couldn't be contained, but sorrow could. <words>270</words>

The final sun path illuminated, completing the circuit that had begun at dawn. <words>283</words> The clock's mechanisms whirred, and deep beneath the palace foundations, ceremonial chambers sealed themselves, entombing the billionaire's collected artifacts of mourning – his daughter's possessions, photographs, even the car that had failed her. <words>315</words>

In the absolute dark of those chambers, hope would be preserved like amber, suspended in time rather than extinguished by it. <words>335</words> Masood closed the astronomical calculations journal, the leather-bound testament to his family's purpose. <words>348</words>

The billionaire approached, his grief momentarily tamed. <words>356</words> "Will this truly help?" he asked, gazing at the clock whose mechanics he had funded but whose soul he couldn't comprehend. <words>376</words>

"We don't imprison to punish," Masood replied, his calm belying the fierce certainty of generations. <words>390</words> "We imprison to protect, to preserve what might otherwise be lost to time." <words>405</words>

As twilight painted the palace in amber and gold, Masood closed the observation dome, knowing that tomorrow's sun would find new paths, new alignments, new reasons to continue their ancient work. <words>436</words>
