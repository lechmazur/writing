Morgan Thale brokered souls like others sold beachfront property, except her listings existed on the spectral plane, and her commission came in memories rather than money. <words>24</words>

The floating tea platform where she conducted business drifted lazily through the Veil Mists, a pocket dimension where time felt weirdly static, as if suspended in amber. <words>46</words>

"This particular residence offers excellent karma potential," Morgan explained to the hovering wisp before her, gesturing toward a shimmering doorway that pulsed with opportunity. <words>66</words>

Her client, a recently departed accountant who'd died while alphabetizing his spice rack, wavered uncertainly at the threshold of his potential next life. <words>86</words>

Throughout the cosmic recycling—that eternal process of souls transitioning between vessels—Morgan had developed a reputation for matching spirits with their perfect next incarnations. <words>106</words>

Behind her modest desk sat her most treasured possession: a dusty wine bottle whose contents had long ago evaporated, leaving only crystallized residue that sparkled with otherworldly potential. <words>130</words>

Morgan's real talent wasn't just in the art of persuasion, though she could convince even the most reluctant spirit to embrace rebirth; it was her ability to learn forgotten songs—those cosmic melodies that guided souls to their perfect matches. <words>162</words>

"I sense hesitation," she observed, her voice gentle yet somehow filling the endless space around them. <words>176</words>

With practiced grace, she lifted the ancient wine bottle and turned it slowly, her eyes scanning the reversed labels that only became legible when viewed through the prismatic effect of the dusty glass. <words>203</words>

"Each soul's journey requires its own unique melody," she explained, beginning to choreograph delicate movements with her free hand while interpreting the backward script. <words>223</words>

The accountant-spirit pulsed with curiosity as Morgan decoded the forgotten song meant specifically for him, her fingers conducting invisible orchestras while her feet stepped through positions known only to those who dealt in soul contracts. <words>252</words>

"This particular incarnation offers excellent opportunities for the artistic expression you denied yourself," she murmured, her movements becoming more elaborate as the translation progressed. <words>274</words>

Fragments of music materialized around them, notes crystallizing in the air like delicate ice formations. <words>288</words>

The platform beneath them, constructed of ancient wood and celestial tea stains, tilted slightly as if responding to the emerging melody. <words>307</words>

"I've brokered ten thousand souls to their new homes," Morgan stated without pride or embellishment, continuing her intricate dance of translation, "but each one requires its own perfect persuasion." <words>334</words>

The spirit brightened, clearly moved by both her choreography and the haunting melody that now fully surrounded them. <words>350</words>

"Your next vessel awaits—a young girl with nimble fingers and access to a piano," Morgan said, completing her translation by setting the bottle down with ceremonial precision. <words>374</words>

The accountant-spirit swirled in what Morgan recognized as gratitude before drifting toward the doorway, now pulsing in rhythm with the forgotten song she had recovered. <words>397</words>

After her client departed, Morgan recorded the transaction in her ledger, her modest penmanship belying the cosmic significance of the exchange she had just facilitated. <words>421</words>

She returned the precious bottle to its place of honor, wiping away a layer of dimensional dust and revealing, just for a moment, a label that read "Songs of the First Harmonies"—her ongoing collection of melodies that had once woven the universe together and would, eventually, do so again. <words>469</words>
