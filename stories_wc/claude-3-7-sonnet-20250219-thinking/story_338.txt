Morrible hunched over her workbench, her wild hair springing in all directions as she tinkered with the cracked phone case under the buzzing fluorescent light of her underground workshop. <words>23</words>

The artificer had claimed this junction in the abandoned subway tunnels decades ago—or perhaps yesterday—time worked differently here where the timelines crossed and folded like origami. <words>45</words>

She remained clinically observant of the phenomenon, personally detached despite the wonder it presented, as she had learned that emotional investment only clouded her understanding of the temporal anomalies. <words>70</words>

Her latest invention—a retrofitted rotary phone connected to the cracked smartphone case through a maze of copper wires and crystalline nodes—had begun intercepting calls from across time. <words>95</words>

"Tuesday, March 17th, 1982: 'Mom, I can't make it to—'" the mechanical voice recited before cutting to static, then, "—July 9th, 2037: 'The protest worked, they're actually listening to us—'" <words>127</words>

Morrible meticulously recorded each fragment, finding patterns in what others would discard as meaningless noise. <words>140</words>

People had always dismissed her as just another eccentric, a stereotype of the mad scientist hiding from society, but they failed to understand that she wasn't hiding—she was searching. <words>166</words>

The incomplete call logs revealed more truth about humanity than any complete conversation ever could: the hesitations, the unfinished thoughts, the raw emotion in voices that didn't know they were being heard across decades. <words>195</words>

In this labyrinth of forgotten infrastructure, where moisture dripped from century-old tiles and rats scurried along electrified third rails that occasionally sparked with temporal displacement, Morrible had discovered her purpose. <words>224</words>

"October 3rd, 2011: 'I've always loved—'" followed by "April 22nd, 1995: '—just wanted you to know that.'" <words>242</words>

She informed no one of her discoveries, having no one to tell, yet she documented everything, creating an archive of humanity's overlooked moments. <words>262</words>

The broken technology in her hands—discarded, like the tunnels themselves—contained more beauty than the sleek, perfect devices that people cradled above ground. <words>284</words>

Sometimes entire days would collapse into minutes as she worked, while a single call fragment might stretch her perception of time into what felt like weeks of contemplation. <words>309</words>

Her workshop overflowed with salvaged treasures: rotary phones, switchboards, tangled wires, and notebooks filled with transcribed conversations—an abundance of objects that somehow emphasized the emptiness of her solitary existence. <words>335</words>

Yet Morrible didn't seek companionship; she sought understanding, finding profound significance in the mundane exchanges that most would ignore. <words>352</words>

"December 24th, unknown year: 'The lights look beautiful from—'" <words>362</words>

This sentence, incomplete like all the others, brought tears to her eyes for reasons she couldn't articulate. <words>377</words>

When the timelines converged most strongly, causing her instruments to whir and the air to shimmer with possibility, Morrible sometimes heard her own voice among the call fragments—future or past, she couldn't tell. <words>406</words>

"I've found it," her voice would say, "in the broken things, in the forgotten places—" <words>420</words>

And though she didn't know what "it" was yet, Morrible continued her work, a zany artificer breaking the stereotypes of what mattered, finding infinity in fragments, and beauty in the spaces between words. <words>451</words>
