Eleanor Whitfield, the small-town librarian of Misthollow, had always been drawn to the whispers of the Whispering Canyon—its walls riddled with ancient carvings that no archaeologist had ever properly catalogued. <words>27</words>

The stolen museum artifact tag trembled between her fingers as she traced the edge of a portal carved into the limestone, a gateway that had remained dormant for centuries until she had discovered its secret. <words>54</words>

"Harvesting grace isn't for the faint-hearted," her grandmother had told her, passing down the knowledge that had flowed through seven generations of Whitfield women who served as the canyon's guardians. <words>78</words>

Eleanor was perfectly flawed for the role—too curious to leave well enough alone, too methodical to make careless mistakes, and just suspicious enough to keep the secret from those who would exploit it. <words>107</words>

She began to dismantle the false rock face that concealed the true portal, her movements precise from years of practice shelving delicate first editions and repairing torn pages with archival tape. <words>134</words>

The bond between the guardians had always been strengthened through their shared love for blackberry cobbler, the recipe changing subtly with each generation but remaining the essential password that identified true members of their circle. <words>164</words>

As she worked, she could feel the silent watchers of the canyon—not just her ancestors, but the other families who had maintained this vigil since before the town was founded, before the museum from which she'd stolen the identification tag had even been built. <words>200</words>

"To become a legend whispered through time," Eleanor recited, completing the oath that every guardian took, though she privately found the grandiosity of it all somewhat ridiculous. <words>225</words>

The portal shimmered as the final piece came loose, revealing the swirling vortex that connected their world to the realm from which grace—the ethereal substance that healed the land and kept the town prosperous—could be harvested. <words>257</words>

"Oh, how very magical," she muttered with mocking sincerity, rolling her eyes at the dramatic flare of light, even as her heart raced with the wonder of it all. <words>280</words>

Eleanor placed the blackberry cobbler at the threshold—an offering to those on the other side who cherished the tartness balanced with sweet crumble, the same beings who had carved the first portals and taught humans how to harvest what they called "grace." <words>318</words>

The cobbler disappeared, and in its place materialized a small globe of pulsating energy—enough grace to keep Misthollow's crops from failing during the coming drought, enough to ensure that the town would never question why their unassuming librarian spent so much time researching obscure geological formations. <words>363</words>

She'd return the artifact tag tomorrow, slipping it back into the museum's storage room with none the wiser, continuing the charade that had protected her family for generations. <words>389</words>

Eleanor carefully stored the harvested grace in the special container passed down through her family, wondering which child in town would show the signs of being the next guardian, the next perfectly flawed soul to maintain this ancient exchange. <words>425</words>

As she sealed the portal and replaced the false rock, she smiled at the thought of all the stories written about mythical heroes, none of which came close to capturing the truth of her mundane yet extraordinary life—a small-town librarian who fed otherworldly beings blackberry cobbler in exchange for the grace that sustained them all. <words>469</words>

In the grand cosmic joke that was her inheritance, Eleanor found both burden and blessing, her perfectly flawed legacy ensuring she would indeed become part of the legend whispered through time, even if only among the silent watchers of the portal-strewn canyon. <words>500</words>
