Garrett Finch meticulously cataloged his latest acquisition, a Baroque-era pocketwatch with an engraved nightingale on its case. <words>15</words> The focused collector made precise notes in his leather-bound journal where a pressed black rose was pinned to the inside cover—a memento from his sister's funeral and the day he chose isolation over heartbreak. <words>43</words> Most days, Garrett was polite but unremarkable, a man who seldom acted odd enough to draw attention, preferring the reliable company of historical artifacts to unpredictable human interaction. <words>68</words>

His carefully constructed solitude began to unravel with the gold-embossed envelope that appeared beneath his door on a Tuesday morning. <words>86</words> "Your presence is requested at the Winter Solstice Gathering," it read, the paper oddly cold to touch, "at the palace of Jotunn the Frost Giant—bring your favorite game." <words>112</words>

Curiosity overcame caution, leading Garrett through an ice-carved archway into a crystalline lair where stalactites glittered like chandeliers and a massive table dominated the center. <words>133</words> "Welcome, final contestant!" boomed Jotunn, a towering blue-skinned giant who gestured toward the gathering of peculiar guests already seated around what appeared to be an elaborate board game. <words>156</words>

"Tonight's tournament spans seven rounds, seven chances to conquer what haunts you," explained the frost giant with unsettling cheerfulness, pointing to the shadowy figure at the table's end—a creature whose form seemed to shift between man and beast. <words>188</words> "That's Despair," whispered the woman beside Garrett, her eyes reflecting light like mercury, "the alpha predator that's been stalking you through those quiet rooms of yours." <words>214</words>

Round after round, the game pieces moved according to inscrutable rules that somehow reflected Garrett's life choices, each move revealing how thoroughly Despair had infiltrated his existence. <words>239</words> "I collect things because they stay," Garrett admitted during the third round, surprising himself with this confession while moving a miniature silver telescope across hexagonal spaces. <words>262</words>

"Things stay until they don't," replied Despair with a smile too wide for its face, advancing a shadowy pawn that devoured Garrett's piece. <words>282</words> "But I stay longest of all." <words>288</words>

Between the fifth and sixth rounds, as frost patterns formed and dissolved on the game board, Garrett realized he hadn't merely embraced solitude—he'd surrendered to it, allowing Despair to become his only consistent companion. <words>321</words> "Fascinating strategy," he remarked with deliberate lightness, though his fingers trembled as he positioned his remaining pieces, "letting me think isolation was my choice rather than your trap." <words>348</words>

The final round stretched until dawn, with Garrett deploying each artifact-shaped token as if constructing a museum exhibition dedicated to possibility rather than loss. <words>372</words> "Check and mate, I believe," Garrett announced with earnest flippancy as sunrise gilded the ice walls, his last move forming a pattern that caused Despair to hiss and dissolve into the board. <words>401</words>

Jotunn's laughter shook icicles loose from the ceiling. <words>409</words> "First victory we've had in centuries!" <words>416</words>

Later, updating his journal beneath the pinned black rose, Garrett added not just detailed notes about the night's strange events, but also seven addresses—one for each fellow player who had survived Despair's game alongside him. <words>448</words> Perhaps his collection could expand to include something that didn't fit in display cases after all. <words>464</words>
