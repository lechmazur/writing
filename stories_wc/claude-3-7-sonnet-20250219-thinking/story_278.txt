Marcus carved time from stone, his fingers perpetually dusted with the remnants of his art, even as he mopped the floors of the Chicxulub Crater Research Base. <words>22</words>

The vintage reading glasses perched on his nose were his one luxury, a gift from Dr. Elaina Chen before she vanished three years ago under circumstances the administration deemed "classified." <words>47</words>

Through those lenses, Marcus had begun to see peculiar patterns in the dust that danced through the sunbeams streaming through the base's geodesic dome—patterns that spoke of doorways unseen by naked eyes. <words>76</words>

The webs of intrigue at the base ran deep; whispered conversations ceased when he entered rooms, and certain sectors remained perpetually locked, their contents known only to the highest-clearance scientists who treated Marcus as if he were invisible. <words>115</words>

Today, as he methodically washed the fleet of research vehicles—a Tuesday ritual as predictable as the director's cruel criticisms—Marcus felt a theoretically spontaneous urge crystallize into certainty. <words>143</words>

"You missed a spot, as usual," Director Harmon sneered, adjusting his tie as he passed through the garage, unaware that Marcus had memorized the keycard sequence he'd just used. <words>170</words>

Twelve years of servitude in exchange for a pardoned criminal record had stretched into fifteen, with promises of freedom that evaporated like morning dew on the crater's edge. <words>198</words>

Marcus glanced at his reflection in the freshly polished hood of the rover—his eyes, magnified by the ancient lenses, held a murky tenderness for the self he was about to leave behind. <words>231</words>

The scientists had never bothered to explain to the cleaning staff why they shouldn't linger in the Particle Analysis Chamber when the afternoon sun aligned with the central skylight. <words>262</words>

They'd never imagined that someone like Marcus would connect the anomalous dust behavior with the disappearance of three researchers over the past decade, or that he'd been sculpting his departure plan in clay models for months. <words>298</words>

With soapy hands and a heart beating percussion against his ribs, Marcus slipped away from the garage, past the dormitories, and into the restricted wing. <words>325</words>

He removed his glasses briefly to wipe them clean before replacing them carefully; these would be his guides through what came next. <words>347</words>

At precisely 3:42 PM, Marcus stood in the chamber's center where dust motes swirled like golden galaxies in the concentrated beam of sunlight; he raised his hands as if conducting an orchestra only he could hear. <words>382</words>

The particles responded, encircling him in a spiraling cocoon that seemed to bend light and space around his form. <words>400</words>

As the security alarm blared belatedly, Marcus felt his molecules begin to dance with the dust, his body becoming indistinguishable from the glittering specks as he surrendered to their movement. <words>432</words>

Later, reviewing the security footage, the baffled scientists would see only an ordinary man who seemed to dissolve into light, leaving behind a small sculpture of a bird taking flight and a pair of vintage reading glasses folded neatly on the floor. <words>472</words>

Somewhere beyond, in a dimension accessed through cosmic debris and human will, Marcus finally began to carve his masterpiece—a new life, free from the weight of others' expectations. <words>500</words>
