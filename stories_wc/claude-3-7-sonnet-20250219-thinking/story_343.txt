The brass gears of the HMS Temperance groaned as Puck hunched over the small table in his quarters, his jester's cap bells jingling mournfully with each sway of the steampunk submarine. <words>27</words>

His painted smile contrasted sharply with the sorrow in his eyes as he stared at the crumpled drawing he'd found wedged between pipes in the engine room. <words>49</words>

"Even fools recognize sacred geometry when they see it," he whispered to himself, smoothing the parchment with trembling fingers while fresh copper paint dried on the corridor walls outside. <words>73</words>

Captain Holloway had ordered the entire vessel repainted during their three-day submersion beneath the Clockwork Sea, unknowingly giving Puck the perfect opportunity to pursue his true calling. <words>98</words>

The drawing contained patterns identical to those Puck's grandmother had taught him to identify in tea leaves—constellations of meaning that had guided their people for centuries before the Industrial Revolution replaced mysticism with machinery. <words>129</words>

Breathing deeply, Puck prepared the ancient ceramic pot, his motley costume becoming iconically unintentional camouflage for the ritual he performed. <words>148</words>

"Your attention, if you please," he commanded with unexpected authority when the off-duty engineers entered the mess hall, his voice lacking its usual performative lilt. <words>171</words>

The crew members paused, steam from their copper mugs curling like question marks in the recycled air. <words>186</words>

"While we wait for paint to dry, perhaps you might indulge an old practice," Puck suggested, gesturing to the teapot and circle of cups he'd arranged on the burnished brass table. <words>214</words>

Lieutenant Reid scoffed, but curiosity pulled the others forward as Puck carefully poured, his bells silent for once. <words>231</words>

"Our ancestors navigated not just by stars but by patterns within patterns," Puck explained, analyzing the geometry of tea leaves clinging to the first empty cup. <words>253</words>

His finger traced invisible connections between the scattered remains, reconstructing knowledge that had been dismissed as superstition by those who worshipped cogs instead of cosmos. <words>276</words>

"Here—see how this formation mirrors the pressure valves' optimal settings?" he noted, finding common ground between the mystical and mechanical. <words>294</words>

One by one, the crew leaned closer, their skepticism softening as Puck demonstrated how the ancient divinations predicted submarine currents with surprising accuracy. <words>315</words>

"My grandmother would say this particular pattern warns of fractures in the southern hull—precisely where we've been hearing that troubling sound," he said, watching realization dawn in their eyes. <words>342</words>

What had begun as a melancholy jester's desperate attempt to restore sacred practices was transforming into something no one, least of all Puck, had intended—a bridge between worlds thought irreconcilable. <words>372</words>

The captain appeared in the doorway, frowning at the impromptu gathering until Lieutenant Reid excitedly explained their discovery. <words>389</words>

As the final hours of paint-drying confinement ticked by, Puck felt a crooked hope unfurling in his chest, fragile yet persistent as the tea leaves themselves. <words>415</words>

Perhaps in this metal behemoth beneath fathoms of indifferent ocean, ancient wisdom and modern ingenuity could finally coexist, each strengthening the other like the double-riveted seams of their underwater home. <words>444</words>

Puck carefully refolded the crumpled drawing—no longer just a relic, but a map to a future where his painted smile might, someday, reach his eyes. <words>470</words>
