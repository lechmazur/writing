Brother Tomas shuffled into the dimension door repair shop, his tattered robes collecting the dust of a thousand realms. <words>16</words> The bell above the entrance chimed with a sound that was almost, but not entirely, like that of an ordinary bell. <words>34</words> "Another door broken, or just browsing today?" asked Meridia, the shop's proprietor, without looking up from the spectral hinges she was oiling. <words>53</words>

"Neither," Tomas replied, pulling a rusty skeleton key from the folds of his garment. <words>66</words> "I need your help to capture the Harmonic Convergence." <words>75</words> Meridia finally glanced up, her eyes narrowing with recognition and something like respect. <words>87</words>

"That cosmic light show happens once every seven thousand years, monk," she said, wiping her hands on an oil-stained rag. <words>105</words> "And with the Dimensional Realignment Act passing next week, all the old pathways are being standardized—you've picked a lightly unbearable time to chase fairytales." <words>129</words>

Tomas placed the key on her workbench with unexpected gentleness. <words>139</words> "The Convergence is no fairytale—it's the universe remembering itself." <words>149</words> He met her gaze steadily. <words>154</words> "I know your reputation, Meridia. <words>159</words> They say you can hear the song each door wants to sing." <words>171</words>

"Poetic nonsense," she scoffed, but her fingers reached for the key with unmistakable reverence. <words>184</words> "This will need seven haunted melodies to activate—impossible to collect in six days." <words>197</words>

"I've already gathered five," he replied, producing a small resonance chamber that hummed with ethereal notes. <words>212</words> "But the remaining two are beyond my reach." <words>220</words>

"Why should I help you, monk?" <words>226</words> Despite her words, her hands were already reaching for her toolbox. <words>237</words>

"Because you were there the last time it happened, weren't you?" <words>248</words> His words hung between them, a truth neither acknowledged for centuries. <words>260</words>

Three days later, they stood in the howling wind of the Cerulean Wastes, recording the mournful cry of a dying star. <words>278</words> The sound was crushing in its beauty, almost too much for mortal ears to bear. <words>292</words>

"Last one," Meridia said, her earlier cynicism tempered by their shared trials. <words>304</words> "You know, I've repaired thousands of doors, but never walked through one for myself." <words>318</words>

The night before the Convergence, they returned to her shop and fitted the key into a door frame that stood alone in the center of her workshop. <words>341</words> The collected melodies swirled around them, each note finding its place in the mechanism. <words>355</words>

"If this works," Tomas said, "we'll witness creation remembering its first breath." <words>367</words> He hesitated. <words>369</words> "I couldn't have done this without your trust." <words>377</words>

"Save the sentiment for after," Meridia replied, but squeezed his hand anyway. <words>389</words>

When the key turned, the door opened to reveal not another place, but another time. <words>404</words> Together, they stepped through to witness the universe crush and remake itself in a symphony of light, bound by the ties of forged trust and the melodies of seven dead worlds. <words>434</words>
