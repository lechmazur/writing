Cassandra slid her trembling fingers across the battered wooden bar top, tracing the water rings left by countless patrons who'd come seeking futures they weren't prepared to hear. <words>25</words>

It was probably unlikely that tonight's reading would be any different, but hope was the last delusion she allowed herself these days. <words>46</words>

"Another end-of-the-world prophecy coming up," she muttered, squinting as the garish neon from outside penetrated the dingy saloon nestled in this absurd maze of billboards that littered the desert like tombstones of a forgotten consumerist era. <words>75</words>

The irony wasn't lost on her—advertisements for lush green lawns and beachfront properties now stood as silent sentinels over cracked earth and dust, between lost years when humanity might have actually done something about their impending environmental collapse. <words>108</words>

"Yes, please tell me how we're all doomed while you sip that plastic-bottled water," she said to the nervous businessman across from her, her molten sarcasm burning through the air between them. <words>134</words>

He fidgeted, clearly uncomfortable with her attitude, but desperation had brought him here, to the edge of civilization, to the woman they said could see beyond tomorrow. <words>158</words>

Cassandra reached into her pocket and withdrew a curious contraption—a small puzzle box adorned with thirteen miniature locks, each one representing a different element of the natural world humans had systematically destroyed. <words>186</words>

"The box stays closed until balance returns," she explained, placing it beside the water rings and focusing her energy to magnify what the patterns revealed. <words>206</words>

The rings began to shift, overlapping and separating like living entities, telling stories of drought, flood, and the few remaining untouched sanctuaries. <words>226</words>

Her mild panic rose as the images clarified—there was so little time left, even less than she'd feared. <words>244</words>

"Your corporation sits on an aquifer that could restore life to this region," she said, her voice steadying as the revelation crystallized. <words>265</words>

The businessman scoffed, "And what would you have me do? Bankrupt my shareholders for some desert flowers?" <words>281</words>

Cassandra leaned forward, eyes flashing, "What I propose is environmental stewardship that benefits everyone—including your precious bottom line." <words>297</words>

She spread her hands, calloused and bare, across the bar top. <words>308</words>

"These hands have shaped more destinies than you can imagine, and they're telling me your legacy hangs in the balance tonight." <words>328</words>

The businessman's facade cracked slightly as one of the thirteen locks on her puzzle box clicked open of its own accord. <words>347</words>

"That's never happened before," she whispered, genuine surprise replacing her caustic demeanor. <words>359</words>

"Perhaps the future isn't as fixed as my readings suggest." <words>369</words>

As dawn broke across the billboard maze, casting long shadows across the parched land, Cassandra watched the businessman's helicopter depart, wondering if her words had planted the seed that might, against all odds, bloom into salvation. <words>405</words>

One small choice, magnified through time and influence, just might be enough to shift the course of what remained. <words>424</words>
