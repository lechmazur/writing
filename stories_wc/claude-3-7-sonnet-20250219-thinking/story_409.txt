Marcus stood in the dusty attic, his bruised knuckles tracing the contours of a mechanical bird, one of dozens of clockwork animals that surrounded him like silent witnesses. <words>22</words>

His face, swollen from last night's fight—a fight he had skillfully ensured he would lose—reflected dimly in the brass wings. <words>40</words>

The clay pot shard had fallen from an old trunk, its ancient inscription catching the weak light that filtered through the cobwebbed window: "To know your worth is to defend it." <words>65</words>

He had become an expert at orchestrated failure, a champion of deliberate mediocrity, skillfully incompetent in a sport he once dominated with passion. <words>85</words>

Marcus closed his eyes, fingers still clutching the shard, when somewhere across the city, a sculptor's chisel struck marble for the first time on a commissioned piece—the sound resonating through his consciousness like a thunderclap. <words>115</words>

The precise moment pulled him into forgotten dreams, visions of victories never pursued, principles abandoned, the person he had refused to become. <words>134</words>

These memories abducted him from the present, dragging him through corridors of his past where his father's voice echoed: "Fighting means standing for something, son, or it's just violence." <words>158</words>

A clockwork monkey nearby spontaneously began to clap its tiny cymbals, the mechanism triggered by vibrations of Marcus's shaking hands. <words>175</words>

He had crafted elaborate excuses—the tournament was rigged, his opponent had connections, the money was better in controlled losses—but the shard's ancient words cut through years of self-deception. <words>201</words>

The clay fragment warmed in his palm as if recognizing its purpose after centuries of waiting for the right broken warrior. <words>219</words>

Marcus had never lacked skill but conviction—throwing fights while pretending external forces dictated his failures, maintaining the close distance between who he was and who he claimed to be. <words>244</words>

The clockwork animals seemed to watch him with their glass eyes as he realized he hadn't been protecting himself from failure but from the responsibility of success. <words>268</words>

Through the dreamscape of his memories, he saw clearly how he had allowed himself to be abducted by fear, becoming the perfect example of talent deliberately squandered. <words>291</words>

Marcus set the shard down among a clockwork elephant missing its trunk, a tiger with a broken spring, and a bear whose mechanical paw eternally reached for something just beyond its grasp. <words>317</words>

Tomorrow's fight would be different—not because he would win, but because he would truly fight. <words>331</words>

The inscription had done what years of bruises couldn't: extinguish the last vestige of self-deception that had become his armor and prison. <words>351</words>

He carefully placed the shard in his pocket, its edges sharp against his calloused fingers, a reminder that some wounds were necessary. <words>372</words>

Outside, the sculptor continued to chip away at marble, revealing the form hidden within—just as Marcus now understood the fighter concealed beneath layers of his own calculated failures. <words>397</words>

The clockwork animals would keep his secret in this dusty attic, this place where time had stopped but was now, with each labored breath, beginning again. <words>421</words>
