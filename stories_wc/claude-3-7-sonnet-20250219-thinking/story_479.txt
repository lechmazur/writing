Eliza Valentine applied another coat of mascara as the paint mixer hummed behind her, churning the special blend of cerulean and gold that would adorn Mrs. Hemley's casket. <words>23</words>

The brass measuring tape glinted on her workbench, a relic from her great-grandmother Mathilda, the first Valentine to realize that death deserved more than black crepe and somber faces. <words>46</words>

As she waited for the paint to reach the perfect consistency, Eliza scrolled through the Valentine Funeral Home's digital archive, a privately maintained social network that documented every service they had performed since 1897. <words>73</words>

"People think what we do is so ordinary," Mathilda had written in an entry from 1923, "as if preparing a body for its final journey is no different than mailing a package." <words>99</words>

Eliza smiled, understanding completely the frustration of being fruitlessly patient with those who saw only the surface of her work. <words>116</words>

The mixing machine beeped, and she moved to check the paint, unspooling the brass tape measure as she walked—a Valentine always measured their steps to the mixing station, an odd tradition Mathilda had started to "elongate the moment between preparation and presentation." <words>149</words>

Seventeen steps exactly, just as it had been in Mathilda's day, when the funeral home occupied this same Victorian on Maple Street. <words>169</words>

The paint was perfect; Eliza felt a surge of jubilation that she could still mix the colors by eye, preserving the ancient practice her family had maintained even as other funeral homes switched to commercial products. <words>200</words>

She dipped her finger into the paint and made a small mark on her wrist—another Valentine tradition, carrying a piece of each client's journey with her for the day. <words>228</words>

Returning to the archive, she uploaded a photo of the paint color alongside Mrs. Hemley's obituary, maintaining the digital continuation of Mathilda's meticulous handwritten journals. <words>249</words>

Her crimson fingernails clicked against the keyboard as she added notes about the brass measuring tape ceremony she would perform later, when no one was watching except perhaps Mrs. Hemley's spirit. <words>276</words>

The measurements—height, width, and the distance between the heart and hands—weren't for the casket dimensions as clients assumed, but measurements of the life lived, a sacred calculation passed down through five generations of Valentine women. <words>307</words>

Eliza felt the familiar tangle of emotions: pride in preserving what others had forgotten, and remorse that so few would ever understand the depth behind her carefully applied makeup and designer funeral attire. <words>336</words>

Her phone chimed with a text from her daughter: "Watching you mix paint while I'm away at college. Miss you, Mom." <words>355</words>

Attached was a screenshot of the archive's livestream—her daughter, faithfully observing, learning the traditions even from hundreds of miles away. <words>374</words>

Eliza's heart swelled as she responded with the Valentine family motto: "Death is ordinary only to those who haven't measured its dimensions." <words>393</words>

She returned to Mrs. Hemley, brass tape measure in hand, ready to honor another life with the glamour and gravity it deserved, knowing that someday her own daughter would continue to elongate the memory of each person who passed through their care. <words>431</words>

In this moment, caught between jubilation for tradition preserved and remorse for all who would never understand, Eliza Valentine was exactly who Mathilda had hoped her descendants would become—extraordinary keepers of the most ordinary transition of all. <words>465</words>
