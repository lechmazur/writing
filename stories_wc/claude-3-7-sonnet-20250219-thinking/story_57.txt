Lord Everett Pembroke III knelt in the soil, pruning roses outside what appeared to be an ordinary corporate building, though he knew better. <words>19</words> The aristocrat had inherited a fortune but preferred the humility of groundskeeping at the secret agent workshop, finding peace amid yard work while his peers managed estates. <words>41</words> His unusually perceptive nature had long made him valuable to the agency, though they mistook his quiet deference for weakness. <words>59</words>

While trimming beneath a window, Everett noticed a small gecko trapped in an overlooked mousetrap, its delicate leg caught but not broken. <words>79</words> "Poor darling," he whispered with genuine concern masked by light-hearted banter, "caught in a spy's trap without proper training." <words>97</words>

Reaching into his pocket for his grandfather's dull letter opener—his peculiar gardening tool of choice—Everett froze as voices carried through the building's notorious echo chambers. <words>121</words> The agency's architects had accidentally created perfect acoustic tunnels, which had revealed more secrets to the gardener than any official briefing. <words>142</words>

"Project Saurian begins tomorrow," came Director Harlow's voice, "all reptiles in the compound will liquify within minutes when we release the compound—perfect for eliminating evidence-carrying creatures." <words>166</words>

Everett felt silent empathy surge through him—his inability to speak up for himself extending to speechless creatures. <words>183</words> His aristocratic education had taught him to suppress his opinions, but never his conscience. <words>198</words>

"You're in quite the predicament, old chap," he murmured to the gecko, carefully working the letter opener under the trap's mechanism. <words>217</words> His hands moved with practiced precision despite the tool's inadequacy—a metaphor for his life, he mused. <words>233</words>

Through unplanned eavesdropping in echo chambers, Everett had learned the security rotation patterns, allowing him to slip into the laboratory that evening. <words>253</words> He located the formula—a viscous blue liquid designed to target cold-blooded metabolisms—and with steady hands, adjusted its molecular structure. <words>273</words>

"Chemistry was the only class Father couldn't bully me out of loving," he remarked to the gecko, now safely tucked in his pocket. <words>293</words> The altered formula would now harmlessly solidify upon exposure to air instead of making reptiles liquify. <words>309</words>

The next morning, Everett maintained his earnest flippancy while trimming hedges as alarms blared inside. <words>324</words> "Frightful noise," he commented to a passing agent, who didn't bother acknowledging the gardener. <words>338</words>

Later, in his modest cottage despite his massive inheritance, Everett released the gecko into his private terrarium. <words>354</words> "Welcome to aristocratic asylum," he said, watching the creature explore its new home. <words>367</words>

Director Harlow never suspected the submissive aristocrat with dirt-stained fingernails and a penchant for rescuing creatures—a fact that amused Everett endlessly. <words>388</words> Some revolutions happen quietly with a dull letter opener and a caring heart, he thought, returning to his yard work with renewed purpose. <words>410</words>
