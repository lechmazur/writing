Matthias the lumberjack whistled as his axe bit into ancient pine, his spirited melodies echoing through the forest he'd known since childhood. <words>19</words> During one particularly stubborn tree's fall, a metallic canister tumbled from its hollow core, containing what appeared to be a coded letter written in an elegant yet unfamiliar script. <words>42</words> The paper felt wrong somehow—manufactured by processes not yet invented—and the message spoke of casualties in a war that hadn't happened yet. <words>63</words>

That night, his nightmares returned—visions of burning forests and mechanical beasts that had plagued him since his military service, now twisted with new, prophetic elements. <words>87</words> Throughout his dawn bike rides along forest trails, Matthias would stop to decode more fragments, his hands shaking less as morning light filtered through the canopy. <words>111</words> Each revelation proved more disturbing: coordinates, battle plans, and references to "the ossuary operation" that mentioned his small town by name. <words>131</words>

The coordinates led to Le Reliquaire, once an ancient bone repository now revamped into the region's most exclusive restaurant, where the wealthy dined among tastefully arranged human remains. <words>157</words> Matthias observed the establishment from afar during his evening bike rides, noting the gracefully awkward movements of a particular server who seemed to float between tables while never quite appearing comfortable in her own skin. <words>190</words>

When he finally secured a reservation, Matthias recognized her immediately—Maya, the granddaughter of the medicine woman who'd helped his family for generations. <words>211</words> "The forest speaks to you too," she whispered harshly while serving his meal, her fingers lingering tenderly against his calloused hand. <words>231</words> "They're using this place to harvest ancestral DNA for their biological weapons, but I've infiltrated their operation to learn the healing traditions they've stolen." <words>255</words>

Together they pieced together the hidden agendas of the restaurant's owners—future war profiteers using time displacement to secure advantages generations before the conflict began. <words>280</words> Matthias brought his lumberjack's strength and Maya her knowledge of herbs and bone-setting as they worked to undermine the operation, communicating through coded messages left along his bike routes. <words>310</words>

Weeks passed as Matthias learned the ancient healing practices from Maya, his nightmares gradually transforming into visions that guided their resistance. <words>330</words> "Destruction and healing come from the same understanding," Maya told him as she taught him to prepare poultices under moonlight, her voice a balance of unwavering firmness and compassion. <words>357</words>

When they finally confronted the restaurant's owner—a man with eyes too old for his face—Matthias understood that his lifelong connection to the forest had been preparation for this moment. <words>386</words> The future wasn't fixed, the coded letter merely one possibility, and as Matthias buried it beneath the oldest tree in his forest, he knew their actions had already begun to revamp tomorrow. <words>419</words>
