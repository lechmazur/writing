Elio wandered through the vast hydroponics chambers of the Arboria, an interstellar orchard ship that had been his unwanted home since he'd fled his master's workshop three cycles ago. <words>28</words>

The shimmering apple trees, genetically modified to bear fruit in artificial gravity, seemed to mock his indecision with their steadfast purpose. <words>46</words>

It was during one of his solitary walks that Elio discovered the fallen bird's nest beneath the simulated sunlight panels, an impossible object aboard a vessel thousands of light-years from any natural avian habitat. <words>73</words>

"How did you get here?" he whispered to the delicate construction of twigs and synthetic fibers, his voice carrying the mocking affection he reserved for fellow lost things. <words>96</words>

Within the nest lay not eggs but an ancient cordless phone, its plastic casing yellowed with age that predated even Earth's first colony ships. <words>118</words>

When Elio pressed it to his ear out of curiosity, the static that greeted him contained patterns—voices struggling through cosmic interference. <words>136</words>

The Arboria's migration between galaxies created unique subspace distortions, and Elio, though a failed engineering apprentice, recognized the potential immediately. <words>153</words>

Over the following weeks, as the great ship sailed across the promise of changing winds—solar and stellar currents that carried them toward the Andromeda Galaxy—Elio worked to reverse-engineer the phone's unexpected properties. <words>182</words>

He was privately open in ways his former master never understood, receptive to the impossible while maintaining a skeptical exterior that kept others at bay. <words>204</words>

The voices clarified gradually: travelers like himself, scattered across time and space, their confessions of fear and hope transmitted somehow through this unlikely conduit. <words>225</words>

"I left everything to find myself," confessed one static-laden voice, "only to discover I'd brought myself along." <words>241</words>

Another shared: "The orchard ships carry more than seeds between stars—they carry our capacity to begin again." <words>257</words>

The wisdom in these transmissions became Elio's nightly meditation as he tended to fruit trees that would someday feed colonists he would never meet. <words>278</words>

"Your worth isn't measured by a master's approval," came a particularly clear voice one artificial night, "but by your courage to nurture what grows within you." <words>301</words>

The ship's botanists had begun noticing Elio's unexpected talent with the most temperamental fruit varieties, his hands gentle where they had once been clumsy with mechanical components. <words>326</words>

When the head orchardist discovered Elio's nighttime communications, rather than reporting the unauthorized technology, she simply asked, "Are they helping you find your way?" <words>347</words>

Elio nodded, suddenly understanding that his apprenticeship hadn't failed—it had simply been with the wrong craft. <words>362</words>

As the Arboria entered Andromeda's outer reaches, Elio placed the phone back in its nest and returned it to the branches of the most thriving apple tree. <words>386</words>

The next day, he formally applied for the orchard apprenticeship program, signing his application with a certainty he'd never before possessed. <words>405</words>

Later, when asked by curious crewmates about his transformation, Elio would smile with that same mocking affection, now directed at his former self, and say, "Sometimes you must cross galaxies to find what was always growing inside you." <words>441</words>
