Kale stood at the edge of the frozen orchard, his sword hanging uncertainly at his hip, a weight he carried but rarely used. <words>21</words>

The frigid tundra stretched endlessly beyond the bizarre grove where fruit trees somehow flourished around bubbling geothermal vents, their steam creating miniature pockets of life in the wasteland. <words>42</words>

Shuffling his feet awkwardly, Kale approached the largest vent where a peculiar tide pool had formed, home to dozens of hermit crabs that perpetually abandoned old shells for new ones. <words>68</words>

"The archivists filed away the final scroll today," he murmured to himself, pulling a blank postcard from his pocket—the last artifact from the old world that had survived intact. <words>95</words>

His naturally awkward demeanor had driven him to this solitary existence, preferring the company of his unusual orchard to the bustling cities where the new regime had systematically erased all traces of traditional knowledge. <words>127</words>

A flash of ephemeral rancor crossed his face as he recalled the burning of the ancient texts, the momentary bitterness quickly replaced by resolve. <words>150</words>

The elders had whispered of the hermit crabs' secret before they were silenced—how their eternal shell-changing mirrored the passages between worlds that the ancients once freely traversed. <words>177</words>

Kneeling beside the steaming pool, Kale observed the crabs' methodical exodus, each abandoning its former home to claim another, leaving emptiness behind that was swiftly filled. <words>203</words>

He placed the blank postcard at the water's edge, watching as condensation formed on its pristine surface like invisible ink revealing itself. <words>224</words>

"Now that they've filed away the evidence, believing they've buried our ways forever, there's nothing left to lose," he whispered, drawing his sword reluctantly, having trained for years without ever wishing to use it. <words>257</words>

The blade caught the steam's light as he traced the ancient pattern above the moving crabs, his movements hesitant yet precise. <words>278</words>

The geothermal vent suddenly surged, engulfing the pool in brilliant vapor that twisted like a living thing around Kale's awkward frame. <words>298</words>

As the largest hermit crab abandoned its shell, a rent appeared in the very air above it—a shimmering boundary between his world and something beyond. <words>323</words>

Kale thought of his teacher's final words: "To restore our traditional systems, one must first become like them—willing to shed what protects us to find a greater shelter." <words>351</words>

The blank postcard began to fill with script in a language long forbidden, coordinates to a place where the old ways still thrived. <words>373</words>

With one final look at his orchard sanctuary, Kale sheathed his sword and stepped forward into the gap that had formed, feeling his body emerge on the other side like a hermit crab finding its true home. <words>410</words>

The rancor that had fueled his quest evaporated like the steamy breath of the vents, replaced by wonder as he beheld the ancient city, preserved in all its glory across the bridge between worlds. <words>443</words>

Behind him, the passage closed as quickly as the hermit crab claimed its new shell, leaving only the blank postcard behind—blank once more and waiting for the next hesitant traveler who might find the courage to emerge. <words>480</words>
