Professor Thaddeus Blackwood, an old-fashioned mage with silver-streaked beard and robes that had seen better centuries, hunched over his workbench in the Arctic Research Greenhouse. <words>23</words>

The midnight sun filtered through the glass dome, casting elongated shadows across lush tropical plants incongruously thriving amid the polar wasteland outside. <words>42</words>

Between his gnarled fingers, Thaddeus turned a gilded fragment of a pharaoh's coffin, tracing hieroglyphs that seemed to shift beneath his touch like living things. <words>63</words>

"This riddle refuses to unfold," he muttered, his seemingly purposefully aimless wandering between workstations belying a methodical desperation. <words>79</words>

The children's voices from the research station's makeshift playground drifted through the ventilation system, their innocent laughter a discordant soundtrack to his ancient pursuits. <words>101</words>

Thaddeus paused, struck by the realization that he'd only ever studied the fragment during playground time, when the station's mirrors vibrated ever so slightly with the children's distant stomping. <words>129</words>

The mage's reflection rippled across the greenhouse's many glass surfaces, each one capturing a different angle of his withered form, his eyes meeting themselves in fractured communion. <words>153</words>

"Show me," he whispered to the fragment, and to his astonishment, his reflections moved independently, each cradling the coffin piece with different reverence. <words>174</words>

A sanctified dread filled the humid air as ghostly arms emerged from the mirrors, ancient limbs of pharaohs and priests reaching toward their sacred relic. <words>196</words>

Thaddeus stood transfixed as the spectral hands cuddled the fragment like a cherished infant, rocking it while hieroglyphs floated from their ephemeral lips. <words>217</words>

"The uncharted frontier lies not in conquest," the mirror reflections chanted in unison, "but in surrender." <words>232</words>

Understanding bloomed within him like the impossible flowers surrounding him—this greenhouse, this anomaly of warmth amid eternal ice, was itself the riddle he sought to solve. <words>256</words>

The mage pressed the fragment to his chest, cuddling it as the apparitions had demonstrated, feeling ancient knowledge flow through his veins like golden light. <words>279</words>

He had come to claim an uncharted frontier of magic, arrogantly believing himself the discoverer, when he was merely being led home. <words>300</words>

The hieroglyphs finally revealed their meaning: a spell not of power but of harmony, connecting disparate worlds across time and space. <words>319</words>

Children laughed outside as Thaddeus knelt in revelation, the fragment melting into his skin, permanently binding him to this nexus between worlds. <words>339</words>

His reflections smiled in unison before fading, their purpose fulfilled in guiding an old soul to a new understanding. <words>357</words>

The Arctic greenhouse hummed with renewed life, plants growing inches before his eyes, their roots reaching toward him as if recognizing a kindred spirit. <words>380</words>

Thaddeus Blackwood, once collector of arcane artifacts, now understood his true calling as guardian of this sacred junction between ice and bloom, death and life. <words>404</words>

As playground time ended and scientists returned to their stations, none would notice the subtle change in the old mage—how he now moved with purpose rather than aimlessness, how his eyes reflected light like polished mirrors. <words>438</words>

The sanctified dread had transformed into reverent awe as Thaddeus embraced his role in a cosmic design far greater than the narrow ambitions that had first brought him to this frozen frontier. <words>470</words>
