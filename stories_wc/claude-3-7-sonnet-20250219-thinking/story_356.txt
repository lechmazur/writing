Meridian scratched calculations along the bulkhead of the cargo hold, a piece of chalk perpetually worn to a nub between his fingers. <words>21</words>

"Time isn't a line," he muttered to the stacks of contraband, his only confidants aboard the notorious pirate vessel Cassiopeia's Revenge. <words>43</words>

The crew tolerated Meridian's eccentricities—the chalk dust that followed him like a ghostly contrail, the warmly aloof manner in which he'd aid injured raiders then retreat to his equations—because no caretaker better understood the ship's ancient systems or the precious cargo they plundered across seventeen star systems. <words>94</words>

He paused in his calculations when Captain Vex's announcement crackled through the intercom, something about another raid, another risk, another chance to die among the stars. <words>123</words>

Meridian knew better than anyone that time unfurled in nebulous patterns, not unlike the cosmic cloud formations he meticulously charted on his vintage star maps. <words>148</words>

"You can't outrun what-ifs," he told the trembling new recruit hiding among the crates, his tone carrying that gentle harshness that had become his trademark. <words>175</words>

The boy clutched an ancient communication device—a "smartphone" from Old Earth—pressing it desperately to his ear as if his former life might answer from across the vast emptiness. <words>208</words>

"That dial tone won't last forever," Meridian said, watching cosmic dust dance in the artificial gravity. <words>223</words>

And just as he spoke those words, the tone cut out, leaving only the hollow silence of space and the soft scratch of chalk against metal. <words>249</words>

"That's your sign," Meridian whispered, completing a complex pattern that resembled both a mathematical formula and the swirling cloud paths visible through the cargo bay's observation port. <words>277</words>

For thirty years, Meridian had served aboard pirate ships, each day wondering what might have happened if he'd chosen differently, if he'd stayed on Saturn's moons, if he'd pursued the love he abandoned. <words>313</words>

The what-if sirens had grown deafening with age, a constant background radiation to his thoughts. <words>329</words>

"Watch carefully," he told the boy, pointing his chalk toward the cosmic storm brewing outside. <words>344</words>

Meridian's calculations weren't just numbers but a map—a way to track the interstellar cloud paths that occasionally, just occasionally, bent time itself into navigable corridors. <words>373</words>

"We all have our escape routes," he said, pressing the dead phone into the boy's hands. <words>389</words>

The alarms blared as imperial cruisers surrounded the pirate ship, but Meridian smiled, finally ready to silence his own what-ifs. <words>412</words>

He stepped toward the observation port where his chalk patterns aligned perfectly with the cosmic cloud formations, and as the first blast hit the Cassiopeia's hull, Meridian simply vanished—not in fire or explosion, but into the mathematical possibility he'd spent a lifetime calculating. <words>457</words>

The boy later claimed the caretaker had become one with the cosmic cloud paths, but the crew knew only that their warmly aloof guardian had finally found peace from his own internal sirens, leaving nothing behind but chalk dust and the faint scent of time unspooling. <words>500</words>
