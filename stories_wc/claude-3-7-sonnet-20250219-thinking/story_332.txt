Ellis tended to her brushes in the exo-atmospheric garden, where engineered blooms floated in low gravity among the stars. <words>17</words> Her solitude was familiar, comfortable even, as she captured on canvas the dance of Saturn's rings through the reinforced glass dome. <words>37</words> The garden had been her sanctuary since accepting the two-year residency at Nova Station, a place where her art could evolve beyond Earth's tired inspirations. <words>60</words>

Between her easel and the viewport lay a battered notepad, its pages warped from the station's humidity regulation cycles. <words>77</words> Ellis had found it wedged between chapters four and five of "Cosmonauts and Their Canvas," one of many volumes she'd borrowed from Dr. Isaacs in the botany lab. <words>102</words>

The notepad contained hushed confessions scrawled in a hand both desperate and disciplined, as if written behind stage curtains while an unseen audience waited. <words>125</words> "I see worlds within worlds here," one entry read, "realms of surprise existing just beyond our perception." <words>141</words>

Ellis returned to her quarters that evening, the borrowed book due back tomorrow, the notepad hidden in her smock. <words>158</words> She traced the writer's words with fiercely gentle fingers, careful not to smudge the graphite testimonies of someone clearly adrift in the same vast emptiness that sometimes threatened to consume her. <words>186</words>

Day after day, Ellis borrowed more books, finding new notes pressed between pages like flowers preserved for posterity. <words>203</words> In time, she recognized the pattern—each confession corresponded to a specific plant in the garden, as if the writer was mapping an invisible connection between literature and life. <words>230</words>

"The Arabian jasmine is dying," today's note warned, "and with it, perhaps the last terrestrial memory I possess." <words>247</words>

Ellis found the jasmine that night, its stems gray and limp in the artificial soil. <words>261</words> With a painter's precision, she began to resuscitate the plant, applying nutrients and adjusting light patterns according to the desperate instructions hidden in the margins of "Botanical Survival Beyond Earth." <words>290</words>

As weeks passed, the jasmine recovered under her care, its white blooms opening to the indifferent stars. <words>306</words> Ellis added her own notes to the battered notepad before slipping it into "The Language of Isolated Growth" for its return journey. <words>327</words>

"I've saved what matters to you," she wrote. <words>335</words> "Meet me here at first cycle." <words>341</words>

When Dr. Isaacs appeared among the revived blooms, Ellis recognized in his eyes the same intimate separation that had characterized her existence—souls connected by necessity yet divided by the vastness between genuine human contact. <words>374</words>

"You found my notes," he said, his voice barely audible over the garden's circulation systems. <words>388</words>

Ellis nodded, offering him both the notepad and her hand—a final leap of faith across the void that had kept them orbiting each other like celestial bodies afraid to collide. <words>419</words>
