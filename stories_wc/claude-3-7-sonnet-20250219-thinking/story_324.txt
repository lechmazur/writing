Marcus shuffled the intelligence reports on his desk, knowing his analysis would be scrutinized by superiors who barely acknowledged his decade of service to the Agency. <words>21</words>

The headquarters hummed with subdued efficiency in this new era where wars were fought with information rather than bullets, a simmering future where silence spoke volumes. <words>41</words>

"There's something you should see," whispered Analyst Chen, sliding a classified folder across his desk with a glance that made Marcus's stomach tighten. <words>60</words>

Inside lay photographs of a laboratory three levels below the main complex, allegedly abandoned after the Neural Mapping Initiative was officially terminated five years ago. <words>80</words>

The rumor had circulated among junior agents for months – someone had succeeded in duplicating consciousness, creating the ultimate deep-cover asset – but Marcus had dismissed it as break room fantasy until now. <words>108</words>

Against all rational judgment, Marcus found himself descending forgotten stairwells after midnight, chasing whispers that promised answers to questions he hadn't dared formulate. <words>128</words>

His footsteps echoed through corridors that had been scrubbed from official blueprints, each reverberating sound seemingly guiding him deeper. <words>145</words>

The laboratory door yielded to his access card – a clearly ambiguous security oversight that could be either intentional invitation or catastrophic mistake. <words>165</words>

Suspended in luminescent fluid, the brain floated serenely behind glass, its preservation tank bearing a simple label: "Duplicate." <words>182</words>

Marcus approached it with professional detachment that shattered when recognition crawled up his spine – the brain's distinctive hippocampal formation matched scans from his own medical file. <words>204</words>

The dreams that had plagued him nightly – operating in countries he'd never visited, killing men he'd never met – suddenly unfolded as something more sinister than imagination. <words>229</words>

His hand moved without conscious permission, fingers extending to jab the interface panel beside the tank, uploading memory fragments he hadn't realized he possessed. <words>250</words>

The screen flickered to life: "Original consciousness backup complete. Advisor persona functioning within acceptable parameters. Dream integration protocol: ACTIVE." <words>267</words>

Marcus staggered backward, understanding washing over him like ice water – he wasn't the original, merely the vessel carrying a fractured copy of someone deemed too valuable to lose. <words>292</words>

The dreamer's calling had been there all along, buried beneath layers of artificial memory, whispering truths his constructed mind refused to acknowledge. <words>312</words>

"We wondered when you'd find your way here," came Director Harlow's voice as lights activated, revealing the laboratory wasn't abandoned after all. <words>331</words>

"The original Marcus died in Istanbul three years ago, but his instincts were too precious to lose. You've been an excellent advisor in his absence." <words>354</words>

In that moment of terrible clarity, Marcus felt the idyllic illusion of his existence fracture beyond repair. <words>370</words>

"Your dreams are his actual missions, downloading gradually to preserve neural stability," Harlow explained with clinical detachment. <words>385</words>

Marcus looked down at hands that had never truly been his own and understood that the rumor he had chased had been himself all along, an echo of someone else's footsteps in time. <words>416</words>
