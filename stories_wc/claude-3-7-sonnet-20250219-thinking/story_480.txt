Morgan Wade was a social media exorcist, specializing in purging digital demons from haunted accounts that left their owners drained of joy and agency. <words>24</words> She clutched an old grocery receipt with a scribbled address as she walked through downtown at midnight, her footsteps echoing against brick walls. <words>46</words> The receipt had arrived mysteriously in her mailbox, requesting her services at a location she'd never visited but somehow felt familiar, like those familiar strangers you pass daily whose faces you know but names you don't. <words>79</words>

Her reputation was quietly loud—her work spread through whispers rather than advertisements, her successes known only to those who needed to know. <words>104</words> Tonight's job would reignite her passion for the work after months of routine hauntings and predictable possessions. <words>121</words> Her methods involved infiltrating secret clubs in alleyways where digital entities gathered, drawn to the collective energy of humans seeking connection in darkness. <words>143</words>

The receipt led her to an abandoned mess hall behind what was once a prestigious music conservatory. <words>159</words> She arrived precisely timed—after the final chord in an abandoned music hall next door, where a lone pianist played for ghosts every midnight before disappearing. <words>184</words>

Morgan pushed open the rusted door, finding a cavernous room bathed in the blue light of dozens of screens, each displaying social media feeds scrolling at impossible speeds. <words>210</words> Five people sat motionless before the screens, their fingers twitching occasionally as if typing on invisible keyboards. <words>226</words>

"They've been like this for three days," said a woman emerging from the shadows, her voice carrying an indifferent enthusiasm that matched the email correspondence they'd shared. <words>250</words> "Something's trapped them in the feed—they can't log out." <words>260</words>

Morgan nodded, unpacking her tools—old technology to fight new demons. <words>270</words> She didn't do this work for money or recognition but to feed her curiosity with life's raw edge, to understand the thin membrane between reality and digital space. <words>298</words>

She connected her modified devices to each victim's phone, watching as code revealed the parasitic program binding them to their screens. <words>318</words> The entity was sophisticated, learning and adapting to previous exorcism techniques she'd used. <words>331</words>

For hours she worked, finding and sealing the digital doorways while the night deepened around them. <words>346</words> Her fingers flew across keyboards while candles burned low, the blue screen light casting everyone in corpse-like pallor. <words>365</words>

One by one, the victims gasped awake, disconnecting from their trance as Morgan's code severed the entity's hold. <words>382</words> The final victim, a teenage boy, looked at her with recognition. <words>392</words>

"You're the exorcist," he whispered. <words>397</words> "I saw you in the feed—it knows you're hunting it." <words>408</words>

Morgan pocketed the grocery receipt—another memento for her collection—and nodded. <words>419</words> "It always does," she replied, packing up her equipment with methodical precision. <words>432</words> She left through the back door into the alley, feeling the familiar post-exorcism emptiness and already anticipating the next mysterious receipt that would arrive to guide her. <words>462</words>
