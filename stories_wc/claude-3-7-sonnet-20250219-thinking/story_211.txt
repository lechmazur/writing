Alastair Pike was a lucky gambler who typically never lost a bet, not even when the world did. <words>17</words>

His fortune had guided him to the abandoned schoolhouse in Whispermill, a ghost town untouched since the Great Decline. <words>34</words>

In the hush of the unremembered future, where civilization had crumbled into mythology, Alastair discovered a botanical diary wedged behind a rusted filing cabinet. <words>56</words>

The leather-bound journal contained meticulous illustrations of plants that could purify the poisoned atmosphere—a treasure more valuable than the gold chips that jingled in his pocket. <words>82</words>

"With these," he whispered with a grin that belied the wasteland stretching beyond the cracked windows, "we might just beat the house after all." <words>105</words>

Alastair knew he needed to duplicate the rare seeds described in the diary, but the knowledge to cultivate them was scattered among the surviving nomadic tribes. <words>132</words>

The once-powerful Regulators, who controlled the remaining clean water and breathable air, had been corrupted by their authority, hoarding resources while communities withered. <words>155</words>

They monitored gatherings, so Alastair devised a plan disguised as frivolity—a nomad social through spin-the-bottle confessions, where tribal elders could share their botanical knowledge without suspicion. <words>183</words>

"Tell me a secret about growing things," he'd prompt when the bottle neck pointed at someone, his voice carrying a cheerful lilt that masked their deadly serious undertaking. <words>212</words>

In the schoolhouse's decaying gymnasium, illuminated by bioluminescent fungi, the tribes gathered weekly, each rotation of the bottle extracting another fragment of forgotten wisdom. <words>237</words>

"The seedlings must taste tears to know what they're fighting against," confessed a wizened woman from the Eastern Mines, her smile cracking through layers of radiation scars. <words>265</words>

"Harvest only under the blue moon," revealed a former Regulator, his eyes darting nervously toward the boarded windows. <words>283</words>

With each confession, Alastair meticulously updated the diary, creating a complete guide to rebirth in a world where death had become the only certainty. <words>308</words>

The Regulators eventually discovered their meetings, sending enforcers to shut down what they called "dangerous nostalgic activities." <words>324</words>

But by then, Alastair had already filled every student desk with duplicate seed pouches, distributed through a network of children who could slip beneath the Regulators' notice. <words>353</words>

"We're playing a long game now," Alastair told his followers, his eyes sparkling with the same reckless hope that had once led him to bet his last rations on an impossible hand. <words>384</words>

As green shoots began to appear in settlements across the barren landscape, Alastair continued his peripatetic journey, the botanical diary tucked safely in his jacket, its pages now filled with not just information but testament to humanity's stubborn refusal to fold. <words>428</words>

In defying the gravity of hopelessness, the lucky gambler had played his greatest hand—betting against extinction itself and, impossibly, winning. <words>450</words>

And each night, as he added to the diary by lamplight, Alastair smiled with cheerful despair, knowing that even this victory was just another round in an endless game against time. <words>481</words>
