Eli Morgan made his yearly pilgrimage to the family's ancestral home during the six-hour layover between his flights from Seattle to Boston. <words>19</words> His collection of bottled lightning bugs clinked softly in his backpack as he hiked through the dense forest toward the abandoned estate. <words>38</words> The Mason family compound had stood for two centuries before sinking partially into the ground after the earthquake of 1976, transforming his great-grandfather's laboratory into a subterranean chamber of wonders. <words>63</words>

What made Eli uniquely suited for scouting these woodland secrets was his somnambulism—he could navigate the darkest passages while completely asleep, accessing ancestral memories unavailable to his waking mind. <words>88</words> His fellow Wilderness Scouts found his ability fascinating, yet Eli remained unapologetically humble about his gift, often dismissing praise with a slight shrug and redirect to others' accomplishments. <words>114</words>

"The lightning bugs help mark the path," he explained to himself, arranging the glowing bottles strategically around the laboratory entrance before allowing sleep to take him. <words>138</words> His body moved with practiced precision down the moss-covered steps into the sunken laboratory where generations of Masons had documented the spiritual energies flowing through these ancient woods. <words>162</words>

While sleepwalking, Eli's hands instinctively reached for weathered journals, his fingers tracing diagrams and notations his conscious mind couldn't comprehend. <words>180</words> His grandfather had been the first to suspect that these woods formed a nexus of spiritual wisdom, and each Mason since had mapped another segment during their somnambulistic explorations. <words>204</words>

The bottled insects cast an ethereal glow across the decaying scientific equipment, their intermittent flashes illuminating the careful notes Eli's sleeping form added to the family's grand cartography of the immaterial. <words>230</words> His loaded curiosity—passed through generations—drove him to explore corners of the laboratory his waking self feared to tread. <words>246</words>

By morning, Eli would awaken surrounded by his lightning bug sentinels, with fresh ink stains on his fingers and no conscious memory of the spiritual topographies he'd documented. <words>272</words> This was the Mason legacy: to scout the boundaries between material and spiritual realms, cataloging woodland secrets that existed beyond ordinary perception. <words>292</words>

Hours later, when Eli collected his bottled guides and headed back toward the airport, his backpack contained rubbings, sketches, and notes his sleeping self had created—additions to the family's sacred atlas of the unseen. <words>323</words> His second flight would depart at sunset, giving him just enough time to photograph and digitize the night's findings before sealing the originals in a waterproof container to be hidden within the laboratory during next year's pilgrimage. <words>356</words>

In business class, thumbing through images on his tablet, Eli's waking mind recognized patterns but couldn't decipher their meaning. <words>373</words> He accepted this division between his conscious and unconscious understanding with the same unassuming grace that characterized his daytime persona. <words>391</words> Between the clouds below and stars above, he drifted into ordinary sleep, already unconsciously anticipating his return to the sunken laboratory and the woodland's spiritual cartography that only his somnambulist self could properly scout and map. <words>425</words>
