Marcus stood nervously by the heavy oak door of the initiation chamber, his post as sentinel a duty he performed with more anxiety than valor. <words>23</words> The leash in his hand tugged as the Grandmaster's terrier, Hermes, sniffed impatiently at the ancient threshold, their evening walk temporarily paused for this unexpected guard duty. <words>46</words> Despite his three years of service to the Ordo Lucis, Marcus remained an outsider, intimately familiar with their customs yet kept distant from their inner sanctum and the knowledge it contained. <words>72</words> His fingers traced the plain plastic ruler in his pocket—standard issue for apprentices, supposedly for measuring herb quantities, though Marcus suspected it held greater significance. <words>96</words>

When Hermes suddenly slipped free and scampered into the forbidden chamber, Marcus's heart nearly stopped. <words>111</words> He pursued the dog into the dimly lit room where a magnificent tapestry hung across the far wall, its intricate patterns seeming to shift and drift in the flickering candlelight. <words>137</words> The door sealed behind him with a soft click, and Marcus realized the illusion of security he had maintained—that he was merely borrowing authority by standing guard—had dissolved completely. <words>165</words>

As Hermes circled contentedly and settled on a cushion, Marcus approached the tapestry, drawn by the ancient symbols woven within its threads. <words>186</words> "This is my chance," he whispered, removing the ruler from his pocket with trembling fingers. <words>200</words> Something about the evenly spaced markings on the plastic measuring tool resonated with the patterns before him. <words>215</words>

Driven by his yearning to understand the ancient writings that the Order protected, Marcus began to methodically place the ruler across different sections of the tapestry. <words>236</words> When aligned at precise intervals, certain threads came into focus, revealing hidden text that seemed to glow with inner light. <words>254</words>

Time melted away as Marcus worked, his determination overcoming his natural timidity. <words>266</words> The text spoke of boundaries between worlds, of sentinels far more important than doorkeepers—guardians of reality itself. <words>283</words> He discovered that the apparent randomness of the patterns concealed a map, a guide to knowledge that the highest members of the Order had kept secret for centuries. <words>309</words>

When the door finally opened and the Grandmaster entered, Marcus stood his ground rather than cowering. <words>324</words> "You've found your way through the first test," the old man said, gesturing toward Hermes, who trotted dutifully to his side. <words>344</words> "The dog chooses who is ready; the ruler reveals to those worthy; the tapestry speaks to those who can truly see." <words>365</words>

Marcus understood then that his assigned post had never been about guarding a door—security was merely illusion—but rather about being tested himself. <words>389</words> As he followed the Grandmaster deeper into the chamber for true initiation, the plastic ruler still clutched in his hand, Marcus felt his fears drift away like threads in an unraveling tapestry. <words>421</words>
