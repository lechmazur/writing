Mira the Reaver scowled at the entrance to Kaleidoscope Park, a place where reality fractured like light through crystal, creating landscapes that shifted and breathed. <words>21</words>

She hadn't raided a village in fifteen years, yet people still crossed the street when they saw her scarred face and the telltale curved blade at her hip. <words>43</words>

The park's charmingly grotesque guardians—stone creatures with too many limbs and flower-petal eyes—seemed to wink at her as she passed, as if sharing some private joke at her expense. <words>67</words>

"Come to watch the pretty lights like everyone else?" asked one statue, its misshapen mouth curving into what might have been a smile. <words>87</words>

Mira ignored it, following the spinning patterns of light until she found herself in a quiet corner where a piece of paper tumbled across her path. <words>111</words>

She stooped to retrieve it—a child's drawing on crumpled paper, showing a stick figure with a sword standing atop a hill of smaller figures. <words>134</words>

Her heart stopped. <words>137</words>

In the margins, in a careful hand unlike the chaotic crayon strokes of the image itself, someone had written: "The blade falls as father's did, as grandfather's before; the reaver's child becomes the reaver forevermore." <words>166</words>

Another poem curled around the bottom edge: "Steel cannot taste starlight, nor fingers dipped in red; what glory waits beyond your reach while vengeance fills your head?" <words>192</words>

The poems continued, nagging with uncomfortable truths, each verse more piercing than the last. <words>205</words>

A child appeared beside her, no more than five, with solemn eyes that reflected the kaleidoscope lights. <words>222</words>

"That's my drawing," said the child, before innocence could be corrupted by convenient untruths. <words>235</words>

"Why did you draw this?" Mira asked, her voice softer than it had been in years. <words>249</words>

"I saw it in my dreams," the child said, pointing to the hill of bodies, "but I don't want it to be real." <words>270</words>

Mira recognized herself in those eyes—before her father had taught her how to wield a blade, before her mother had taught her how to hate. <words>294</words>

"Who wrote these poems?" she asked, tracing the scrawled words with her calloused finger. <words>308</words>

"My grandmother writes those everywhere," the child replied with an eye-roll of mocking affection. <words>321</words>

"She says some people need to be reminded until they listen." <words>332</words>

Mira knelt, her knees cracking against the crystal path, "And what do you want instead of this?" <words>348</words>

The child's face lit up with kaleidoscope colors. <words>356</words>

"I want to taste the stars," the child whispered reverently, "Grandmother says it's possible in a single kiss, if you kiss someone who has never known darkness." <words>382</words>

Mira saw herself reflected in fractured light—past, present, and a possible future breaking free from the pattern etched across generations. <words>403</words>

She tore the drawing carefully along its center, separating the hill of bodies from the sword-wielding figure. <words>419</words>

"Sometimes we must tear away what we were taught to become," she said, handing back only the bottom half. <words>437</words>

As the kaleidoscope lights spun around them, Mira felt something ancient and hardened crack open inside her chest—not yet a star-tasting kiss, but perhaps the possibility of one. <words>466</words>
