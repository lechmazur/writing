Morgan stood at the farmers market, studying the faces of the actors she'd hired to mimic her own, searching for the twin she never knew. <words>23</words> The bustling market provided perfect cover for her typically unique approach to finding her other half, a desperate method after conventional searches had failed. <words>45</words> Each actor had been given subtle variations of her mannerisms, scattered throughout the crowd like seeds of her identity, waiting to draw out the one person who might recognize herself in them. <words>76</words>

Clutched in Morgan's hand was her only clue – a baseball signed with impossibly precise handwriting: "To the separated sisters: Mountain's peak holds your truth before world's end." <words>103</words> The signature belonged to someone calling themselves "Traveler, 2089," a detail that had once seemed like a joke until strange events began confirming its authenticity. <words>130</words>

The farmers market hummed around her, vendors hawking produce beneath colorful canopies, unaware that forbidden knowledge circulated among them like a current. <words>152</words> Morgan spotted the signal – an actor dropping a purple handkerchief – and knew someone had taken the bait. <words>169</words>

"You're looking for yourself," came a voice behind her, eerily similar to her own. <words>183</words> "I've been watching your actors for weeks." <words>190</words>

Mira was her mirror, yet somehow sharper, more defined, as if she'd lived life with clearer purpose. <words>208</words> The baseball passed between them, crystal shadows dancing across its surface as prophecy awakened in their identical eyes. <words>225</words>

"We need to reach the peak," Mira whispered. <words>232</words> "The time traveler warned that only by reuniting what was divided can we subdue what's coming." <words>248</words>

That night, they ascended the mountain whose silhouette had haunted Morgan's dreams. <words>260</words> The path was unmarked, sacred in its isolation, leading to a clandestine meeting place where boundaries between present and future thinned to gossamer. <words>283</words>

At the summit, they found others waiting – twelve people with the baseball's mark embedded in their palms. <words>300</words> "The apocalypse comes when twins separated at birth meet again," said the eldest among them. <words>314</words> "Unless those twins understand why they were divided." <words>322</words>

Mira gripped Morgan's hand as ancient knowledge unfurled between them. <words>332</words> Their separation had been deliberate, a safeguard against powers that awoke only in their unity. <words>348</words>

"We must learn to be both separate and whole," Morgan realized, "to outlive the prophecy." <words>363</words>

The baseball began to glow, its stitches unraveling to reveal coordinates, dates, instructions. <words>377</words> Their identical fingers traced the patterns that only they could interpret, a language written in the very structure of their shared DNA. <words>397</words>

As dawn broke over the mysterious peak, the twins stood with newfound purpose – not to fight destiny, but to become its architects. <words>419</words> Below, the farmers market was setting up again, ordinary commerce continuing in blissful ignorance of how close the world had come to ending, saved by two halves finding themselves in time. <words>451</words>
