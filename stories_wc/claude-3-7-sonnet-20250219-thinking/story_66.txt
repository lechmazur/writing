Theo slipped into the plant communication study facility just before dawn, another day of hiding in plain sight. <words>16</words>

The military would never think to look for a deserter among botanists obsessed with how ferns and philodendrons might gossip. <words>33</words>

He checked his appearance in the cracked mirror hanging beside the hydroponic chambers, the fracture lines matching the invisible fault lines running through his life. <words>54</words>

"Time for another puzzle," he whispered to the trembling leaves around him, pulling out one of the jigsaw boxes he used to measure his days in this strange limbo. <words>79</words>

As his fingers methodically connected piece to piece, Theo found himself dizzyingly grounded—simultaneously lost and more present than he'd ever been. <words>100</words>

The plants responded differently when he assembled puzzles; their electrical signals—monitored by the lab's equipment—changed rhythm in sync with his progress. <words>122</words>

It was Dr. Emerson who first suggested he try reconstructing stories from the shattered porcelain masks found in the lab's storage room, ancient artifacts from cultures that once believed plants harbored spirits. <words>151</words>

"They were ritual objects," she explained, "used to commune with the green world, then deliberately broken to release the stories back to the earth." <words>173</words>

Theo began piecing together the masks each evening after the researchers left, whispering the stories he imagined into the empty laboratory as the plants seemed to lean toward him. <words>202</words>

"I'm trying to break the cycle," he told a particularly attentive orchid one night, "of running, hiding, disappearing." <words>220</words>

The fragments of porcelain felt warm under his fingers, as if they remembered the faces they once covered and the tales they once held. <words>242</words>

Months passed, measured in completed puzzles and reconstructed masks, until Theo realized he'd told the plants more about himself than he'd ever shared with another human being. <words>267</words>

One night, following an impression he couldn't explain, Theo placed a completed mask into the lab's kiln, watching through the window as intense heat began to carbonize the delicate porcelain. <words>295</words>

The mask blackened, and as it did, every monitoring device in the lab spiked simultaneously—the plants were responding more strongly than ever before. <words>317</words>

What happened next would later be described as a massive electrical anomaly, but Theo experienced it as a moment of perfect clarity—the plants were offering him sanctuary. <words>342</words>

His noble foolishness, this desperate attempt to communicate with non-human consciousness, had somehow worked. <words>355</words>

When the research team arrived the next morning, they found the kiln cold, a carbonized mask inside, and their equipment recording unprecedented patterns of plant activity. <words>380</words>

Theo was gone, but in the soil of every planter, they discovered tiny puzzle pieces, arranged in patterns too deliberate to be accidental. <words>405</words>

Dr. Emerson sometimes stands before the cracked mirror, swearing she catches glimpses of a serene face watching from within the leaves reflected there. <words>425</words>

And if she listens closely enough in the quiet hours, she can hear fragments of stories whispered by a voice that finally found where it belonged—neither here nor there, but somewhere in between, in the green language of photosynthesis and growth. <words>464</words>
