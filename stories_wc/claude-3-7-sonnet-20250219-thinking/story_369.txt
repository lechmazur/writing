Victor Aldridge traced the contours of his latest enigma, a wooden maze so complex that even he wasn't certain of its solution. <words>19</words>

The lighthouse keeper and fanatical puzzle maker had spent decades crafting conundrums that no one would ever solve, each one more intricate than the last. <words>40</words>

From his tower on the desolate rocky island, he watched the mainland with optimistically bitter eyes, convinced that someday someone would appreciate his genius. <words>60</words>

The morning's mail boat had delivered the first of what Victor knew would be two fateful letters—this one from his estranged daughter, announcing her engagement to a man she'd never met. <words>87</words>

"She'll learn," he muttered, returning to his workbench where a piece of string lay coiled like a sleeping serpent. <words>104</words>

The string would become the solution to his newest creation, a puzzle that required one to wriggle through emotional labyrinths as much as intellectual ones. <words>127</words>

Victor had begun tracking his spiritual development through these puzzles, each completed work marking another step toward what he called enlightenment. <words>145</words>

The mysterious packages had started arriving three weeks ago, each without a return address, each containing an object from his past that he'd thought long buried. <words>170</words>

A chess piece from his father's set, a pressed flower from his wedding, a child's drawing signed with tiny handprints—the weight of secrets grew heavier with each delivery. <words>195</words>

Someone knew. <words>197</words>

Someone was solving him. <words>201</words>

The lighthouse creaked against the evening wind as Victor's fingers manipulated the string with lethargic excitement, both dreading and craving the pattern it would reveal. <words>225</words>

"Puzzles within puzzles," he whispered, attaching one end of the string to a photograph of his daughter as a child and connecting it to other artifacts arranged across his wall. <words>254</words>

The web took shape—connections he'd never acknowledged, patterns of abandonment and fear that had driven away everyone who might have loved him. <words>275</words>

That night, another package arrived, smaller than the others. <words>284</words>

Inside lay a silver key and a note reading only: "The lighthouse keeps more than ships safe." <words>299</words>

Victor trembled as he approached the door in the basement he'd never opened, the door the previous keeper had warned him about. <words>319</words>

Beyond it, shelves of puzzles identical to his own stretched into darkness, each labeled with dates and names—his predecessors, all trapped in the same obsession. <words>342</words>

The final package arrived the next morning containing nothing but a mirror. <words>353</words>

For seven days, Victor dismantled his puzzles, unraveled his string web, and opened windows that had been shut for years. <words>372</words>

When the second letter came, he was ready—his daughter would visit next month, and this time, there would be no riddles between them. <words>395</words>

The string that had mapped his secrets now tied around the final package he would send: a puzzle box containing only truth, addressed to himself, from himself. <words>423</words>
