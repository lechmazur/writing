Marcos Del Rio, the most decorated exorcist in the suspended treehouse city of Altavida, polished his silver amulet and scoffed at the newcomers fumbling with basic protection sigils. <words>23</words>

"Amateurs think possessions are just about smoke and dramatic chanting," he muttered to his apprentice Lucia, who rolled her eyes with practiced tolerance at his thousandth iteration of this particular complaint. <words>46</words>

His reputation had been built through decades of fearless confrontations with the Amazon's most malevolent spirits, yet the shadow of his mentor, the legendary Sofia Vega, still somehow managed to eclipse his considerable achievements. <words>73</words>

"She exorcised three major demons during a solar eclipse with nothing but a bent hairpin and pure attitude," the elders would reminisce, while Marcos gritted his teeth and pretended not to hear. <words>101</words>

The wizard's battered grimoire he'd inherited from Sofia—reluctantly bequeathed with her dying admonition to "try not to destroy the universe"—lay open on his carved mahogany desk, its pages yellowed and dog-eared from centuries of desperate consultations. <words>135</words>

When the Keeper of Bridges announced the sudden closure of the Spirit Pathways due to unexpected ethereal turbulence, Marcos felt an endearingly feisty grin spread across his face, recognizing opportunity where others saw calamity. <words>165</words>

"This is it, Lucia—our chance to implement the Retrograde Vitality Incantation!" he declared, already flipping to the forbidden section he'd been secretly studying for months. <words>189</words>

Lucia's expression shifted from confusion to horror. <words>196</words>

"The youthify spell? You can't possibly—that's precisely what drove Sofia halfway to madness!" <words>211</words>

Marcos waved away her concerns with infuriating nonchalance. <words>219</words>

"Sofia lacked my precision and, frankly, my superior understanding of temporal mechanics," he said, while privately acknowledging the crushing weight of responsibility settling onto his shoulders. <words>242</words>

When the central timekeeper of Altavida—the massive crystalline clock towering above the canopy—dared to skip a beat during the equinox alignment, Marcos seized his moment. <words>267</words>

The ancient spell erupted from his fingertips in spirals of emerald light, not toward any demon or spirit, but toward the tangled roots of the city itself. <words>291</words>

"You're not exorcising anything!" Lucia shouted above the magical tempest. <words>300</words>

"No," Marcos replied with a wink, "I'm rejuvenating the pathways themselves—creating new routes that only we understand!" <words>317</words>

As the spell completed, the withered spiritual highways that had connected Altavida to the otherworld for centuries began to pulse with renewed vigor, branching into elaborate new patterns that bypassed the closure entirely. <words>345</words>

The Council of Elders stared in disbelief as spirits flowed seamlessly through Marcos's newly crafted channels, the exorcist himself directing traffic with theatrical flourishes. <words>367</words>

"I suppose it's a clever solution," admitted Elder Tomas reluctantly, "though completely unauthorized and catastrophically risky." <words>383</words>

Marcos bowed with exaggerated humility. <words>388</words>

"Just doing what any reasonably gifted exorcist with access to forbidden magic and a healthy disregard for proper protocol would do," he replied, savoring how Sofia's shadow seemed to recede just slightly from his periphery. <words>422</words>

Later, as apprentices flocked to him for guidance through the new pathways, Lucia nudged him gently. <words>437</words>

"You know they'll be telling stories about this for years," she said, "especially the part where you almost collapsed the entire western quadrant before adjusting the spell matrix." <words>464</words>

Marcos grinned and tucked the grimoire safely away. <words>472</words>

"The almost-disasters are what make the victories so sweet, my dear—just make sure they spell my name correctly in the records." <words>495</words>
