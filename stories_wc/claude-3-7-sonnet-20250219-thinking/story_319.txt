Linden stood at his post, the frail guard's uniform hanging loose on his diminishing frame as the prisoners filed past for the morning sorting. <words>21</words>

Each day they sorted debris washed up by the tides, separating valuable driftwood from the worthless flotsam—not unlike how fate had sorted Linden himself onto this forsaken tidal island. <words>46</words>

The sour-smelling alchemy phial pressed against his chest beneath his uniform, its contents promising either salvation or a swifter end than the wasting disease consuming him. <words>71</words>

He watched the horizon with resolutely wavering conviction, both desperate to see the signal and terrified of the choice it would demand. <words>92</words>

The guards' painted allegiances were visible in the bright insignias on their sleeves, but Linden's true loyalty remained hidden, much like the fading marks on his skin from the alchemist who'd promised him another path. <words>125</words>

While supervising the prisoners' sorting work, he slipped away to the lone oak that had somehow survived the salt and storms, his fingers tracing the fresh message carved into its bark: "Tonight. High tide. Ready yourself." <words>159</words>

Linden had been exchanging messages through this tree for months, each carved word a small rebellion against the destiny the island's warden had mapped out for dying guards like him. <words>186</words>

Throughout sorting, he kept his gaze steady and his trembling hands hidden, knowing that by morning, he would either be free or feeding the creatures that circled the island's treacherous shores. <words>216</words>

As darkness fell and the tide rose, Linden clutched the phial, remembering the alchemist's words: "Drink when water kisses stone, and breathe without fear." <words>239</words>

The liquid burned his throat, smelling of fermented herbs and something metallic, as he waded into the rising waters. <words>257</words>

He felt the transformation begin—fingers webbing, skin hardening—as he spotted the small boat approaching through the mist. <words>275</words>

Linden had to yank himself free from the undertow that seemed determined to claim him, just as the island had tried to claim his future. <words>298</words>

The figure in the boat was familiar only through descriptions carved into bark: the alchemist's apprentice, come to guide him to the mainland. <words>322</words>

"You're changing already," she whispered, helping him aboard, "but remember, the potion only lasts until dawn." <words>339</words>

As they rowed away from the prison that had been both his duty and his cage, Linden felt a peculiar mixture of sorrow and hope—sorrow for the man he had been, hope for whoever he might become. <words>376</words>

The weight of his uniform sank beneath the waves, a final surrender of his painted allegiance to the island. <words>395</words>

He looked back once at the silhouette of the lone oak against the night sky, its bark bearing witness to his escape from a predetermined fate, before turning his face toward the distant lights of possibilities yet unwritten. <words>432</words>

The tide continued its eternal sorting of what would remain and what would be carried away, indifferent to the small victory of one frail guard who had finally chosen his own tide to follow. <words>466</words>
