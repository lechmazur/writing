Tenlo gazed nervously at the throbbing bioluminescent walls of Bacteriopolis, his fingers instinctively strumming discordant notes on his lute. <words>17</words> The minstrel's repertoire had grown stale in this bacteria-powered city, where even the streetlamps pulsed with cultivated microbes that converted waste into endless energy. <words>38</words> He pulled the crumpled photograph from his pocket—a faded image of constellation patterns his grandfather had mapped before the world turned to bacterial solutions for survival. <words>60</words> Tenlo's performances had earned him moderate fame, though his smile rarely reached his eyes when he thanked his audiences, his gratitude rarely sincere amidst his growing emptiness. <words>82</words> 

In his cramped apartment, a single candle burned low, its flame dancing precariously as he made his decision. <words>98</words> "I must deploy my grandfather's plan before this flame gutters out," he whispered, smoothing the photograph against his trembling knee. <words>116</words> The star patterns formed a map—a route out of Bacteriopolis to the rumored wilderness beyond the gleaming bacterial vats and fermentation towers. <words>137</words> Tenlo's lute case contained his few possessions: three sonnet scrolls, a bacterial power cell, and the navigation tool his grandfather had crafted for this very purpose. <words>160</words>

The city's residents engaged in their nightly cautious revelry, celebrating another day of bacterial bounty while carefully monitoring their resource consumption. <words>179</words> Tenlo slipped among them, offering performances as he made his way toward the outer districts, each song a calculated distraction rather than an expression of joy. <words>203</words> The navigation tool glowed faintly as he aligned it with the sky between buildings, confirming his grandfather's patterns still matched the stars above. <words>224</words>

"You're actually leaving?" asked Mira, a fellow minstrel who had followed him to the city's edge. <words>239</words> Tenlo nodded, for once allowing sincerity to crack through his performer's mask. <words>251</words> "There must be more than bacterial efficiency and prescribed entertainment," he said, gesturing toward the dark horizon beyond the city's glow. <words>270</words>

The candle in his pocket lantern flickered dangerously as he reached the final checkpoint. <words>284</words> Guards monitored the bacteria-processing station, but Tenlo's status as a minstrel—considered harmless entertainment—allowed him to deploy his grandfather's distraction: a small vial that temporarily increased bacterial luminescence. <words>311</words> As the guards rushed to regulate the sudden surge, Tenlo slipped through the barrier, navigation tool aligned with the Polaris constellation. <words>330</words>

The wilderness engulfed him with unfamiliar sounds and organic scents that no bacterial fabrication had ever replicated. <words>346</words> His candle sputtered in the natural wind—a phenomenon he'd only read about—and as its light failed, stars blazed overhead with unprecedented clarity. <words>369</words> For the first time in years, Tenlo played a melody that came from within, his nervousness transforming into wonder. <words>388</words> The photograph had led him here, but now the real stars would guide his journey to find purpose in this world of magnificent uncertainty. <words>410</words> His lute's music floated through genuine air as he walked forward, each step more sincere than any performance he had ever given in Bacteriopolis. <words>433</words>
