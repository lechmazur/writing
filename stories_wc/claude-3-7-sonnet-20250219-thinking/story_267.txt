Elrin stood at his post, a mild-tempered guard watching over the Singularity Suites at the Galaxy's Edge Black Hole Resort. <words>19</words>

Each day, amid bike rides along the observation rings, he noticed something peculiar—the fabric of reality seemed thinner here at the event horizon. <words>41</words>

The resort's advertisement promised "a vacation on the edge of everything," but Elrin sensed there was more to it than tourist propaganda. <words>61</words>

What began as an odd feeling became an unraveling thread he couldn't ignore, especially when he noticed the stray cats. <words>79</words>

Impossibly, cats existed here, slinking between the artificial gravity wells, disappearing into maintenance passages that weren't on any map. <words>97</words>

"Cats always know," his grandmother used to say in that poetically bland way of hers, stating profound truths with the emotional impact of discussing the weather. <words>121</words>

One evening after his shift, Elrin borrowed a guest's forgotten hoverboard rather than his usual bike and followed a tabby with a crooked tail through twisting alleyways between the resort's quantum stabilizers. <words>149</words>

The cat led him to a service door that opened into a chamber absent from resort schematics, where a massive blacksmith's anvil floated in zero gravity at the chamber's center. <words>178</words>

Surrounding it were figures in environment suits, harvesting what appeared to be fragments of space-time itself, hammering reality on the anvil like metal. <words>199</words>

Elrin retreated, understanding now why reality felt paper-thin—it was being harvested, manufactured, sold. <words>214</words>

The next day, he pilfered a maintenance uniform as a disguise, affixing a counterfeit ID badge bearing the name "Technician Voss." <words>233</words>

With practiced blandness, he documented each discovery in his journal: "Found reality mining operation. Management involved. Ethical implications significant." <words>249</words>

Security would expect him to report this, to play the hero—or to join the operation and profit as a villain. <words>269</words>

He would do neither. <words>273</words>

By day, Elrin maintained his guard post; by night, he followed the cats, learning the paths between worlds, mapping the operation with meticulous care. <words>298</words>

There was savage bliss in this secret knowledge, in rejecting the roles assigned to him by others. <words>314</words>

He sabotaged nothing, reported nothing, but carefully collected everything—coordinates, procedures, names—while the resort continued its brisk business of luxury at reality's edge. <words>337</words>

Three weeks later, when the resort mysteriously closed for "structural renovations," only Elrin noticed the cats had all disappeared the day before. <words>358</words>

And when authorities finally arrived to investigate reports of cosmic manipulation, they found only an ordinary resort and a mild-tempered guard who shrugged and said he'd seen nothing unusual. <words>388</words>

In his quarters, beneath a loose floor panel, lay a data crystal and a single note: "Reality is neither hero nor villain, just material for those with hammers." <words>418</words>

Elrin smiled as he pedaled his bike along the abandoned observation deck, watching the black hole spin, knowing exactly how many realities had been fed to its hunger. <words>444</words>

The universe unraveled one thread at a time, and he alone held the spool. <words>458</words>
