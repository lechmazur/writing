Marcus, an underachieving mage with a reputation for botching even the simplest spells, squinted at the package on his doorstep. <words>19</words>

It was clearly misdelivered, addressed to someone named Stella at a location that didn't exist in his small town situated at the boundary of his grandfather's farmland, property that would soon be sold to developers. <words>50</words>

With the bored excitement that characterized his mundane existence, Marcus tore open the brown paper to discover a porcelain doll head with eyes that blinked mechanically when tilted. <words>77</words>

"Exceptionally usual," he muttered, examining the exceptionally crafted yet ordinary-looking object—exactly the sort of trinket tourists bought at the local flea market. <words>99</words>

Three more misdelivered packages arrived over subsequent days: an ancient-looking key, a star chart with peculiar markings, and a letter addressed simply to "The Descendant." <words>126</words>

The letter mentioned coordinates that, when plotted on a map, pointed to the abandoned weather monitoring station his grandfather had once mentioned—a relic from before the town existed. <words>155</words>

Curiosity finally overcoming his characteristic lethargy, Marcus trudged through overgrown wheat fields, the doll head and other items stuffed into his backpack. <words>177</words>

The "weather station" turned out to be a disguised entrance leading underground to what was unmistakably an abandoned space station control room, its dusty consoles still humming with latent energy. <words>207</words>

When Marcus placed the doll head on a curious indentation in the central console, its eyes began blinking in a deliberate pattern, scanning him. <words>230</words>

"Genetic verification confirmed," announced a synthetic voice as screens flickered to life around him, displaying text in a language he somehow understood despite never having seen it before. <words>258</words>

"Welcome, Magus Stellaris," the voice continued, "seventeenth generation descendant of Station Commander Elara, who chose exile on Earth rather than abandon her principles during the Great Schism." <words>290</words>

With each revelation, Marcus felt the weight of generations of self-imposed limitations lifting as the system began to unveil his true heritage. <words>311</words>

His so-called magical failures hadn't been failures at all—they were attempts to channel cosmic energy through the wrong paradigm, like trying to run starlight through copper wires. <words>339</words>

"The farmland sale finalizes tomorrow," the system warned after analyzing his memories, "which will trigger automated geological surveys that will expose this facility." <words>363</words>

Marcus placed his hands on the control panels, feeling ancient knowledge flow into him—knowledge his family had intentionally suppressed for generations, believing the power too dangerous. <words>391</words>

"They set a trap for themselves," he realized aloud, "limiting their potential out of fear, passing down only enough magic to recognize our heritage but not enough to reclaim it." <words>425</words>

The doll head's eyes projected a holographic display of the station's true purpose: not just monitoring Earth, but protecting it from something waiting in the dark between stars. <words>454</words>

With newfound determination replacing his lifetime of magical underachievement, Marcus began activating systems dormant for centuries, his face illuminated by alien light as he sprung the trap on his own limitations at last. <words>489</words>
