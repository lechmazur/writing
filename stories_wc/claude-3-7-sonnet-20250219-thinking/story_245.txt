Krez paced the length of the abandoned spaceport flight deck, his daily jogging ritual made more vicious today by the fresh sting of betrayal. <words>19</words>

The single chopstick tucked into his boot knocked against his ankle with each step, a constant reminder of the partner who'd sold him out to the Galactic Authority. <words>44</words>

"Fourteen million credits," he spat into the void of the cavernous hangar, his voice echoing off derelict ships and empty cargo containers. <words>63</words>

That was all it had taken for Lina to betray seven years of smuggling together through the Outer Rim territories. <words>81</words>

Krez's heart pounded not just from exertion but from what his mentor had once called "the heart's revolt"—that moment when loyalty calcifies into its opposite with startling finality. <words>108</words>

He completed his fifth lap, then stopped at the makeshift altar he'd assembled from discarded navigation panels near the flight deck's eastern edge. <words>129</words>

The ritual was abstractly physical, like trying to grasp smoke with bare hands, yet he performed it daily with unwavering precision. <words>148</words>

Krez produced a small pouch of rare Senmari leaves, the last contraband he'd run before everything collapsed. <words>165</words>

"To memorialize not what was lost, but what was never real," he muttered, boiling water in a portable heater and steeping the leaves in his only remaining teacup. <words>191</words>

The biting sincerity of his words hung in the recycled air as he carefully swirled the cup three times counterclockwise. <words>211</words>

With practiced movements, he upended the cup onto a flat section of panel, using the chopstick—once half of a pair, now solitary like himself—to tap three times on the porcelain bottom. <words>240</words>

He lifted the cup, studying the pattern of leaves with the concentration of a cartographer mapping unmapped territories. <words>257</words>

The leaves had scattered into what resembled a cascade—another sign pointing toward the hidden waterfalls of Novaria, whose coordinates he was slowly deciphering through this ancient divination practice. <words>285</words>

No one believed the waterfalls existed; that's what made them the perfect hiding place for the emergency fund Lina knew nothing about. <words>307</words>

Krez traced the leaf pattern with the chopstick, committing it to memory alongside the dozen others he'd collected. <words>325</words>

"Three more patterns," he calculated aloud, resuming his jog with renewed purpose, "and I'll have the full coordinates." <words>343</words>

The abandoned spaceport groaned around him, a husk of former glories now housing only his determination and rage. <words>361</words>

Tomorrow, he would run another five kilometers across these cracked landing pads, brewing another cup, reading another pattern, inching closer to the waterfalls that represented not just wealth but vindication. <words>392</words>

Krez picked up his pace, the chopstick clicking against his ankle in rhythm with his footfalls, a metronome keeping time with his revenge. <words>414</words>

"The heart revolts," he whispered to no one, to himself, to the ghost of his former partner, "but it also rebuilds." <words>434</words>

His shadow stretched long across the flight deck as he ran, a solitary figure turning betrayal into purpose with each determined stride toward a future only he could see in tea leaves and bitterness. <words>471</words>
