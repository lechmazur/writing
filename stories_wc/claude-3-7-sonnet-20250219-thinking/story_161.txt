Eugene Harper, a vigilant orchardist with calloused hands and keen eyes, volunteered at the Aerofold Paper Airplane Test Facility every Thursday afternoon with mechanical precision. <words>22</words> He was never tardy, arriving exactly seventeen minutes before his shift—just enough time to brew the terrible coffee and savor its familiar bitterness before the real work began. <words>47</words> Throughout volunteering, Eugene maintained a facade of enthusiastic curiosity that concealed his true purpose beneath layers of affable small talk and meticulous attention to detail. <words>71</words>

Six months ago, Eugene's son had died testing experimental aircraft for what had been described as a "routine calibration flight," but the inconsistencies in the official report gnawed at him like beetles in his apple trees. <words>104</words> The antique letter seal he'd found among his son's possessions—bearing the strange insignia of a stylized wing inside a hexagon—matched the emblem on classified documents he'd glimpsed in the facility director's office. <words>138</words>

"Fascinating how aerodynamics mimics nature," Eugene would comment with sardonic glee as he catalogued flight patterns, his orchard-trained eyes detecting anomalies that computer systems missed. <words>160</words> The breakthrough came when Dr. Reeves brought her pet peacock to the facility for what she called "biomimetic research," unaware that Eugene understood exactly what those feathers revealed. <words>185</words>

"Let me demonstrate something rather interesting," he announced one afternoon, carefully arranging fallen peacock feathers beside failed prototype designs. <words>201</words> "See how the patterns in a peacock's tail—these mathematical ratios, these precise angles—reveal flaws in your supply chain?" <words>219</words> As bewildered engineers gathered, Eugene mapped the connection between feather patterns and structural weaknesses, unraveling conspiracies of corporate sabotage that had doomed his son's aircraft. <words>243</words>

"The beauty of patterns," he explained, pressing the antique letter seal into a document that would later reach federal investigators, "is that they never lie, even when people do." <words>271</words>

The facility erupted into chaos as Eugene's evidence exposed how competitors had infiltrated the supply chain, how test data had been manipulated, how his son's death had been anything but accidental. <words>302</words> His methodical dismantling of the conspiracy brought no joy, only the hollow satisfaction of pruning a diseased branch. <words>318</words>

Months later, after the indictments and settlements, Eugene stood in his orchard at sunset, launching paper airplanes made from the case files. <words>338</words> Each plane carried a piece of the tragedy aloft before spiraling earthward, a ritual of release performed with the same precision he brought to tending his trees. <words>363</words>

"Always on time," he murmured to his son's memory as the final paper airplane—folded from the exoneration document—soared higher than the others, catching the dying light. <words>389</words> The vigilant orchardist watched it glide, a small smile of sardonic triumph crossing his weathered face as he finally allowed himself to grieve, surrounded by the perfect patterns of life he had always understood better than most. <words>427</words>
