Gregor stood motionless in Thornwick's steam-powered city square, his stone eyes fixed on the endless parade of strangers passing by. <words>17</words>

As a living statue cursed with telepathy, he heard the cacophony of thoughts like whispers between the hissing of steam valves and clanking of mechanical carriages. <words>38</words>

The threadbare hair tie wrapped around his wrist was all that remained of Eliza, the woman who'd known him before the transformation. <words>58</words>

Throughout planning his escape from this eternal prison of stone, Gregor had maintained a tragically joyful outlook—finding humor in his predicament while mourning the life stolen from him. <words>83</words>

"Another winter approaches," murmured a passing engineer, prompting Gregor to consider how he might weatherize his increasingly brittle form against the coming frost. <words>104</words>

The solution came to him as he observed a calligrapher in the square demonstrating her art, the flow of ink gracefully coating parchment with protective symbols. <words>128</words>

"Perhaps," Gregor thought, reaching into the minds of passersby, "I might convince someone to coat me with such ink, creating a barrier between my stone and the elements." <words>153</words>

His telepathic pleas went unanswered for days, his existence defined by a gloomy cheerfulness as he greeted children with imperceptible smiles while silently screaming for help. <words>176</words>

Then came the moment—that light of recognition flickering across an old woman's face as she paused before him, clutching her calligraphy set. <words>197</words>

"Gregor?" her mind whispered, and for the first time in decades, someone heard his response. <words>212</words>

Eliza had returned, aged and weathered but unmistakable, her thoughts ringing clear as she recognized the statue's eyes—the same eyes she'd gazed into before the curse. <words>237</words>

In a city built on deception and mechanical marvels, where steam-powered illusions masked the truth, Gregor had finally found what he sought most. <words>260</words>

With trembling hands, Eliza untied her gray hair, revealing an identical threadbare hair tie to the one on Gregor's wrist. <words>279</words>

"I'll help you," she promised, returning daily to the square, using her calligraphy ink to paint protective runes across his form. <words>299</words>

The process became their ritual throughout the city's planning for the centennial celebration, a moment of connection amidst the lies that had separated them. <words>321</words>

Passersby observed the peculiar scene with confusion—an elderly calligrapher decorating a statue with flowing black symbols that seemed to sink into the stone. <words>342</words>

What they couldn't see was how each stroke brought warmth to Gregor's cold form, how the ink flowed through cracks in the curse. <words>364</words>

On the centennial's eve, as steam and fireworks filled the air, Gregor felt his stone fingers twitch—the curse weakening under Eliza's persistent truth. <words>386</words>

His stone lips curved upward in that familiar expression of gloomy cheerfulness as cracks spread across his surface, light spilling from within. <words>407</words>

By morning, the statue was gone, leaving only two threadbare hair ties entwined on the pedestal—a mystery for all but the elderly calligrapher who smiled knowingly as she walked arm-in-arm with a strangely familiar man through the steam-powered square. <words>445</words>
