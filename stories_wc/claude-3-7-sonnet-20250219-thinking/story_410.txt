Edmond's forty years as a hermit had sharpened his senses beyond what others could comprehend, even as it dulled his capacity for human interaction. <words>21</words>
In his cavern cathedral, where phosphorescent fungi painted the stalactites in ghostly blues and greens, he worked tirelessly with tools others would have discarded. <words>42</words>
His blunt scissors—rusty, misaligned, and technically useless—were strangely effective in his gnarled hands for trimming the delicate tendrils that threatened to choke the ancient water systems. <words>64</words>
"Like me," he often chuckled to the echoing darkness, "not pretty, but functional." <words>76</words>
The underground springs had once fed the metropolis above, but years of neglect had rendered them as forgotten as Edmond himself. <words>96</words>
Each morning, he would bake a small loaf of bread in the thermal vents—not for sustenance alone, but as a ritual of remembrance. <words>119</words>
The scent of fresh bread amplified his memories of the world above, a world he'd left when sorrow and misanthropy had driven him underground. <words>141</words>
Today's loaf was particularly aromatic, wafting through the vast chambers, making the luminous fungi seem to pulse more vibrantly in response. <words>162</words>
Snipping at a cluster of overgrown moss, Edmond froze as an unfamiliar mechanical groan reverberated through his sanctuary. <words>178</words>
In all his decades below, he'd never heard the ancient maintenance elevator activate—he'd assumed it was permanently disabled, like his faith in humanity. <words>200</words>
The bread scent must have penetrated further than ever before, perhaps reaching the surface through some previously blocked vent. <words>217</words>
A distant bell chimed, signaling the elevator's arrival at this empty floor of the forgotten underworld. <words>232</words>
Clutching his scissors like a weapon, Edmond approached the elevator doors, his heart pounding with equal parts dread and a perverse hope. <words>251</words>
When the doors opened to reveal not humans but a small maintenance robot—sent to investigate the source of reported underground water pressure fluctuations—Edmond let out a laugh that was half sob. <words>279</words>
"Forty years restoring these water systems," he muttered to the uncomprehending machine, "and they send you instead of a thank-you card." <words>299</words>
The robot beeped and extended a small compartment containing what appeared to be a forgotten maintenance worker's lunch—including a stale, mass-produced bread roll. <words>322</words>
Edmond looked from the pitiful roll to his own gloriously fragrant loaf cooling on the thermal vent, and for the first time in decades, felt something like pride. <words>348</words>
"Perhaps isolation has its benefits," he mused, guiding the robot toward the main valve junction where his most critical repairs awaited verification. <words>369</words>
The phosphorescent flora seemed to brighten along their path, responding to the robot's subtle electromagnetic field, casting Edmond's weathered face in an almost holy glow. <words>393</words>
In this moment, standing in his subterranean cathedral with his blunt scissors in one pocket and fresh bread in the other, Edmond realized his isolation hadn't diminished him—it had transformed him into something essential, something strangely effective. <words>428</words>
"I may be alone," he told the robot, which recorded his words as potential system anomalies, "but at least I bake better bread than whoever made that sad excuse for a roll." <words>459</words>
And as he continued his work in the luminous cavern, the city above never knowing how closely their water supply depended on an astute hermit with inadequate tools but adequate humor, Edmond found a certain peace in his peculiar purpose. <words>494</words>
