Elara pirouetted across the thought experiment chamber, her body eloquent where her words failed her. <words>14</words>

The holographic walls pulsed with possibilities as steam rose from her evening bubble bath, the only time she allowed herself to truly contemplate the burden she carried. <words>42</words>

On the edge of the tub sat the singed hexagonal patch from the Artemis VII mission, its alien symbols glinting with an intelligence that mocked Elara's linguistic ineptitude. <words>69</words>

"No understand good," she muttered, mimicking the simplified speech others used with her, though her mind spun with sharp-witted observations she couldn't articulate. <words>94</words>

The water rippled as she submerged the patch, watching familiar patterns emerge above the bubbles—constellations from a home system she'd never seen but somehow remembered. <words>121</words>

Tomorrow would be the annual Brightwood family photograph, a tradition spanning twelve generations since the spacecraft had crashed and her ancestor, also a dancer, had salvaged the mysterious patch. <words>150</words>

Each year, they posed with the relic, chronicling its slow activation in their midst, a silent countdown that Elara alone could interpret through movement rather than words. <words>178</words>

The final prophecy was clear to her body if not her tongue: when the thirteenth generation posed with the fully awakened patch, someone must become the vessel for what came next. <words>209</words>

Elara's fingers traced the edge of the patch, her ambivalence saturating every cell—pride in being chosen warring with resentment at the cosmic responsibility thrust upon her without consent. <words>237</words>

She'd spent years in denial, pretending her extraordinary dance abilities were merely talent rather than alien communication flowing through her limbs. <words>259</words>

The bubbles popped around her in rhythmic sequences, and she found herself responding, her arms and torso undulating in countering patterns that felt ancient and new simultaneously. <words>286</words>

The thought chamber's sensors captured her movements, translating them into spectral equations that hovered above the bath—the language of cosmic dance that transcended her verbal limitations. <words>313</words>

Her family believed the prophecy foretold destruction—that Elara's dance would somehow prevent the aliens' return—but as her fingers brushed the now-glowing symbols, she understood the magnificent twist. <words>341</words>

The aliens hadn't crashed; they had seeded, waiting for a being fluid enough to move between worlds, to dance the story of connection rather than conquest. <words>369</words>

Tomorrow, when the family gathered for their photograph, the patch would complete its transformation, not into a weapon as they feared, but into a key. <words>394</words>

As Elara rose from her bath, water streaming from her body like liquid starlight, she embraced the weight of her family's denial and her own destined role. <words>424</words>

She would stand before the camera, the patch against her heart, and when the flash illuminated them all, she would finally dance the truth that her tongue could never speak. <words>455</words>

That they were never meant to fear the stars, but to dance with them—the final prophecy not an end, but a beginning written in movement rather than words. <words>485</words>
