The skeptical minstrel Finnian whistled a doubtful tune as he examined the dragon-scale armor scrap glinting oddly under the fractured skylight of the abandoned disappearing ink factory. <words>24</words> Rumors claimed Loki—not the mythological figure but an immortal trickster who had borrowed the name—frequented this place at midday to collect messages from the rusted mailbox by the entrance. <words>48</words> Finnian had tracked the trickster for months, ever since Loki had cursed his lute to play only funeral dirges, effectively ruining his career at the royal court. <words>72</words> "This plan is mad enough to work," he muttered, running calloused fingers over the dragon scale's iridescent surface, which seemed to absorb then reflect the afternoon light in patterns that made perfect yet impossible sense. <words>102</words>

The minstrel's scheme hinged on reckless generosity, a concept so foreign to tricksters that it often left them confounded. <words>120</words> He fashioned a crude slingshot from his lute strings and a forked piece of metal he'd salvaged from the factory floor. <words>140</words> The disappearing ink factory, once famous for producing ink that would vanish exactly seven days after use, now stood empty except for the hiss of ancient steam vents erupting at unpredictable intervals from the corroded pipes. <words>173</words>

Finnian positioned himself behind a toppled vat, eyes fixed on the mailbox whose empty cavity seemed to hush the world around it as the midday sun hit its precise center. <words>200</words> The minstrel had learned from an old scroll that dragon scales, when heated by steam and offered freely to an immortal, created a binding oath that even the cleverest trickster couldn't evade. <words>228</words> As the mailbox door creaked open and a pale hand reached inside, Finnian aimed his slingshot at the nearest steam vent—the timing had to be perfect. <words>253</words>

The hiss of escaping steam provided the exact trajectory he needed, launching the dragon-scale scrap in an arc that seemed to bend the very laws of physics in a manner both impossible and entirely plausible. <words>286</words> "A gift freely given, Loki!" called Finnian, his voice echoing through the cavernous factory as the trickster instinctively caught the glittering object. <words>306</words> The immortal's eyes widened with a mixture of surprise and suspicion as steam enveloped the scale, activating ancient magic that bound him to a single truth for a year and a day. <words>336</words>

"What trick is this, mortal?" demanded Loki, his fingers unable to release the scale even as recognition dawned in his ancient eyes. <words>356</words> Finnian bowed with exaggerated courtesy, a smirk playing across his lips. "No trick—merely a gift that compels you to speak only truth and restore what you've taken, including my music." <words>383</words>

The trickster's laughter filled the space—not angry but impressed—as impossible magic settled into plausible reality: the recklessly generous gift had become the perfect trap. <words>407</words> "Well played, minstrel," admitted Loki with grudging respect. "Not many understand that sometimes the most potent magic lies in giving rather than taking." <words>427</words> As Finnian strummed his lute, once again filled with every melody imaginable, he felt an irreverent awe at having out-schemed a being who had tricked emperors and gods for millennia. <words>455</words>
