After the last star burned out, Sebastian still attended lectures in the dim corridors of Subterranean University, the oldest institution in the underground city of the mole people. <words>25</words> His coal miner's headlamp—salvaged decades ago from the Epsilon collapse that had killed thousands—cast the only remaining light strong enough for him to read the ancient texts on immortality. <words>53</words> The lamp's glow revealed his pale, ageless face, unchanged for centuries, a face that had witnessed the slow dimming of the universe itself. <words>74</words> His immortality—a genetic anomaly discovered during his first doctoral program—had transformed him from student to specimen, from learner to legend. <words>94</words>

"The burden of the gifted," Professor Molen often reminded him, "is that they alone must carry knowledge across epochs." <words>113</words> Sebastian nodded mechanically whenever she said this, his detachment perfect yet his devotion absolute. <words>126</words> His ten-thousandth semester project involved digitizing the Wanderer's Collection—travel journals swapped between explorers who had ventured beyond the city's obsidian walls. <words>147</words> These mundanely glorious accounts, written by ordinary mole people who had glimpsed extraordinary things, contained fragments of wisdom Sebastian believed critical to his research. <words>168</words>

Each night, he sat in his cramped quarters, carefully scanning pages with the university's last quantum converter, transferring fading ink to imperishable data crystals. <words>190</words> "Reality is subjective," wrote one explorer named Thela, "malleable to those who understand its parameters." <words>205</words> Sebastian had read this particular passage forty-seven times, searching for the key to becoming master of his own reality, perhaps even to end his endless existence. <words>229</words>

The mole people tolerated Sebastian's presence with a mixture of reverence and unease, treating him as both scholar and relic. <words>248</words> They didn't understand his persistence—how could they, with their beautiful, brief lives spanning mere centuries? <words>263</words> They couldn't comprehend the weight of watching civilizations rise and fall like breaths, of accumulating knowledge that no single mind should contain. <words>284</words>

One evening, while digitizing a particularly weathered journal, Sebastian discovered a formula scribbled in margins by someone who had clearly understood more than they should. <words>307</words> The equations described reality not as fixed but as infinitely variable, consciousness as the catalyst for creation. <words>323</words>

Sebastian's hands trembled as he processed what this meant—immortality wasn't his prison, but his workshop. <words>339</words> Time wasn't his sentence, but his medium. <words>347</words>

He closed the journal and removed his ancient headlamp, setting it beside his terminal with uncharacteristic tenderness. <words>364</words> For the first time in millennia, Sebastian felt something beyond detached devotion—he felt purpose. <words>379</words> Tomorrow, he would begin his final thesis, not on escaping immortality but on wielding it, on becoming what the universe now lacked: a light in the darkness. <words>407</words> He would become, at last, a master of his own reality in a cosmos that had forgotten how to shine. <words>427</words>
