Linden Moss adjusted the humidity dials in the salt crystal growing chamber, her apprentice robes catching on the condensation pipes as she hurried to check her experiment before the next laundry cycle began. <words>28</words>

The small cardboard box on her workbench trembled slightly, its corners reinforced with silver sigils that gleamed under the phosphorescent lights. <words>46</words>

"I do apologize most sincerely for the disturbance, but might I trouble you for just a smidgen more clarity in your communications?" Linden whispered to the box, her obnoxiously polite tone echoing against the growing crystals. <words>74</words>

As an understudy sorcerer at the Bureau of Arcane Acoustics, Linden had discovered that salt crystals formed amid laundry cycles—when the building's magical resonance was at its weakest—could capture whispers from distant places. <words>106</words>

Her superiors would be absolutely horrified if they knew she was eavesdropping on the whispers of an ancient oak grove, especially since her official assignment was merely to monitor crystal growth rates. <words>136</words>

"Most grateful for your patience, ancient ones," she cooed into the box as the washing machines rumbled to life in the adjacent room, the perfect cover for her unauthorized research. <words>164</words>

Linden's real motivation—to track cultural evolution among the primordial tree spirits—was considered dangerously progressive in the conservative sorcery community. <words>185</words>

A voice like rustling leaves emerged from the box: "We have slept... but now we hear... now we wake..." <words>202</words>

Linden's smile froze as she realized her eavesdropping had done more than gather data—it had created a connection, waking the unheard consciousness of the grove itself. <words>229</words>

"I'm terribly sorry to inconvenience you, but might I humbly suggest you return to your most peaceful slumber?" she asked, panic rising beneath her carefully maintained etiquette. <words>255</words>

The salt crystals throughout the chamber began to pulse with amber light, growing at impossible speeds as they absorbed the ancient energy flowing through Linden's makeshift receiver. <words>282</words>

"Would it be tremendously troublesome if I were to ever-so-slightly hinder your awakening process?" Linden asked, frantically placing containment wards around the box while maintaining her unfailingly courteous tone. <words>313</words>

The washing machines entered their spin cycle, and the vibrations made the crystals sing in harmony with the oak spirits' voices, creating a resonance that shattered three specimen jars. <words>342</words>

"Please accept my deepest apologies for any inconvenience," Linden muttered, diving beneath her desk as a crystal formation exploded above her head. <words>364</words>

A tendril of root-like energy snaked from the box, caressing Linden's cheek with ancient curiosity. <words>380</words>

"How delightful to meet a listener after these millennia," the grove consciousness whispered, its playful tone carrying an undercurrent of something vast and hungry. <words>404</words>

Linden maintained her smile while carefully reaching for the emergency containment charm hidden in her boot. <words>419</words>

"Might I offer you some refreshment after your long sleep?" she asked, buying time as the laundry's final rinse cycle approached—the moment when the building's protective wards would automatically reset. <words>449</words>

The entity laughed—a sound like autumn leaves crunching underfoot—and retreated slightly into the box. <words>464</words>

"We accept your hospitality, little listener," it said, "and look forward to learning how your species has evolved in our absence." <words>487</words>

Linden's polite smile remained fixed as the dread settled in—her thesis on cultural evolution was about to become far more practical than theoretical. <words>509</words>
