Ellis traced the worn edges of his pressed penny collection, each coin a memory from a different dreamscape he'd visited. <words>17</words> As a vivid dreamer, he could navigate the boundary between waking and sleep with unusual precision, his consciousness slipping between worlds like water through cupped hands. <words>42</words> His fingers oscillated between a 1986 Chicago penny and one depicting the Statue of Liberty, both tarnished from frequent handling and the peculiar energy they absorbed during his nocturnal journeys. <words>70</words>

Tonight, with the moon full and heavy, Ellis knew it was time to return to the enchanted orchard, where the living statues stood sentinel over secrets he'd been patient enough to discover gradually over years of dream-visits. <words>108</words> The statues, with their granite eyes and limestone smirks, were rationally mischievous gatekeepers who tested visitors with riddles that seemed absurd yet contained hidden logic. <words>134</words> Ellis had earned their trust by solving their puzzles, by being the patient guardian of their secrets, and by never attempting to take the silver-leafed fruit that whispered forgotten languages into the ears of those who listened. <words>170</words>

He arranged seven pennies in a precise constellation on his bedside table, mimicking the arrangement of stars that formed the often-overlooked Lunar Path. <words>194</words> His breathing slowed as sleep approached, bringing with it the familiar tingle that preceded dream-travel. <words>209</words>

The orchard materialized around him, its twisted trees bearing fruit that pulsed with soft blue light. <words>225</words> A marble nymph pivoted on her pedestal, her stony face betraying a hint of recognition as Ellis approached. <words>243</words> "You've come at the threshold of an apology yet to be spoken," she observed, her voice like gravel sliding down a mountainside. <words>265</words>

"The cosmic deception unravels slowly," Ellis replied, the rehearsed phrase ringing hollow now that he stood before her, knowing that somewhere in the waking world, someone waited for words he couldn't bring himself to say. <words>300</words>

The statues began to circle him, their movements synchronized with the swaying branches overhead, as if all were puppets on the same celestial strings. <words>324</words> Ellis reached into his pocket and produced a penny pressed with the image of a key, the newest addition to his collection. <words>345</words>

"I follow the moon paths," he announced, with a dour amusement that masked his uncertainty. <words>359</words> "I know the truth now—that you aren't guardians of this orchard but prisoners of it." <words>376</words>

The nymph's expression shifted from stone to flesh for just a heartbeat. <words>388</words> "Then free us," she whispered, "with that apology you've carried across dreams, for it isn't meant for any mortal, but for us who have been bound by your ancestors' hubris." <words>423</words>

Ellis felt the weight of generations lift as he finally understood his role—not to unravel a deception, but to end one with simple, honest words. <words>449</words> "I'm sorry," he said, and the orchard exhaled around him, the statues' vigilance dissolving into gratitude as they crumbled back to the earth from which they'd been conjured long ago. <words>482</words>
