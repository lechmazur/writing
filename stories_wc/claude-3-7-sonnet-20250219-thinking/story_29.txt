Sir Elian approached the final turn of the hedge maze, armor gleaming despite years of quests that had left his spirit unblemished. <words>18</words>

The last expedition had nearly broken him, but hope flickered stubbornly in his chest as he sought the one thing whispered about in ancient scrolls: the Machine of Cycling Regrets. <words>42</words>

Legend claimed this terrible device trapped souls in endless loops of their deepest remorse, and somewhere within its gears was his beloved sister, lost three summers past. <words>65</words>

The hedge parted like a curtain, revealing an orchard garden that defied reason—trees bearing luminous fruit that pulsed with inner light, pathways lined with flowers that sang melancholy harmonies. <words>92</words>

In the center stood the Machine, a monstrosity of spinning obsidian and crystal, whirring with the captured sorrow of countless victims. <words>112</words>

Elian's cleverly naive approach had gotten him this far; while other knights had sought the Machine with brute force, he had pieced together its secrets by listening to the tales of village children who spoke of dreams filled with whispering trees. <words>149</words>

A streetlamp at the garden's edge—oddly modern against the timeless landscape—flickered, dimmed, and exhaled into darkness. <words>166</words>

The Machine seemed to pulse stronger in the new darkness, and Elian heard the agonized whispers of the trapped, his sister's voice among them—an agonizing recognition that flooded him with bittersweet hope. <words>198</words>

From his pocket, he withdrew the object that had brought him here: a stray jigsaw edge, neither metal nor stone, found in his sister's abandoned bedroom. <words>223</words>

The piece hummed in his hand, responding to the Machine's rhythms with a counter-melody that made his teeth ache and his heart soar simultaneously. <words>245</words>

Elian closed his eyes, allowing his mind to drift into the cryptic frequencies emanating from both the Machine and the puzzle piece, feeling their discordant patterns like a mathematics of pure emotion. <words>274</words>

"I understand now," he whispered, the knowledge bringing tears of revelation as he stepped toward the Machine. <words>290</words>

He pressed the jigsaw edge against a seemingly random section of the Machine's surface, where it adhered like a key finding its lock. <words>312</words>

The Machine's rhythm faltered, stuttered, then began syncing with the frequency of the puzzle piece—with Elian himself as the conductor between them. <words>333</words>

As the patterns aligned, faces appeared in the Machine's surface—the lost, the taken, the regretful—their expressions transforming from eternal torment to something like peace. <words>357</words>

Among them was his sister, her eyes meeting his with recognition that pierced Elian with both unbearable pain and transcendent joy. <words>377</words>

The knight remained steady as the Machine's power neutralized, the awful beauty of its collapse washing over him in waves of release. <words>397</words>

When the last gear stilled and the orchard fell silent, Elian found himself surrounded by the formerly trapped, his sister's arms around him, the successful reclamation of the lost bringing an agonizing bliss that made every step of his journey worthwhile. <words>435</words>
