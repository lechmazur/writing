Marla tended to the mechanical birds with practiced indifference, her status as their begrudging guardian a punishment for crimes she could barely remember committing. <words>21</words>

The sanctuary existed within the folds of spacetime, a pocket dimension where broken automatons came to be repaired or forgotten, much like Marla herself. <words>44</words>

She carried her rustic bread paddle everywhere, a relic from her previous life as a baker, now repurposed to scrape away the corrosion that threatened to consume her charges. <words>69</words>

The birds chirped and whirred with metallic voices, sometimes sparking when their gears needed oiling, sometimes singing with an uncanny beauty that made Marla's throat tighten. <words>93</words>

It was during the third rotation of the artificial sun that the first postcard arrived, slipping through a crack in reality and landing atop a copper-feathered nightingale. <words>117</words>

The image depicted a shoreline Marla didn't recognize: impossibly blue waters, trees that seemed to dance, and inhabitants whose faces were just slightly too perfect to be human. <words>142</words>

More postcards followed daily, each bearing dreamlike vistas of an unknown island, each signed with a simple invitation: "Come home." <words>161</words>

Marla's dangerously friendly demeanor—the one that had once led her to trust the wrong people—emerged again as she began sharing the postcards with her mechanical charges, watching their glass eyes light with something like recognition. <words>194</words>

She began to illustrate what she saw in the postcards, mapping connections between the images, the birds' reactions, and her own forgotten memories. <words>215</words>

By analyzing these mysterious messages, she discovered patterns, coordinates hidden in coastlines, messages encoded in cloud formations. <words>230</words>

Society had gripped her tightly in its mechanical jaws, sentencing her to this isolation, but the postcards offered a way to break free. <words>251</words>

"They tried to clip our wings," she told a brass-winged falcon as she oiled its joints, "but they forgot we could still dream of flight." <words>274</words>

The sanctuary, once her prison, transformed as she worked—each illustrated map expanding the boundaries, each decoded message weakening the walls. <words>293</words>

When the final postcard arrived, Marla understood that the unknown island wasn't a place but a state of being, a reclamation of the joy she had surrendered to conformity and fear. <words>321</words>

With trembling hands, she used her bread paddle to pry open the sanctuary's main console, rewiring the system that had kept them all trapped in this pocket of existence. <words>347</words>

The mechanical birds rose in unison, their wings catching light that shouldn't exist in this dimensionless space. <words>363</words>

Marla laughed through her tears as reality bent around them, the boundaries between worlds growing thin. <words>379</words>

"We're going home," she whispered, feeling both the sorrow of leaving the sanctuary that had sheltered them and the joy of their imminent freedom. <words>401</words>

As the flock spiraled upward, Marla clutched her bread paddle like a talisman, no longer a tool of servitude but a key to her liberation. <words>425</words>

The final barrier between worlds dissolved like mist, and Marla soared alongside her charges, no longer their guardian but their fellow traveler, breaking free from society's grip into a sky unmarked by boundaries or regret. <words>457</words>
