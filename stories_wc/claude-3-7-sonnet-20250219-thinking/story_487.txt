Viktor, the docile bruiser with hands like sledgehammers and a voice soft as rainfall, stood at the entrance to the abandoned greenhouse labyrinth. <words>20</words> His disturbingly calm demeanor never wavered as the first man-eating vine snapped inches from his face, retreating only when he hummed a gentle note. <words>43</words> The old greenhouse keeper had warned him in broken English about the dangers lurking within, but Viktor's understanding of the language was as fragmentary as the treasure map he'd pieced together from shredded scraps found beneath the warped floorboards of his late grandmother's cottage. <words>84</words>

A distant drum solo began echoing through the glass corridors, making the carnivorous plants sway rhythmically as if entranced. <words>103</words> Viktor moved deeper into the maze, following the pulsing of the drums and the reconstructed map that promised to lead him to the legendary conductor's baton—an artifact rumored to raise the dead with a single flourish. <words>138</words>

"You no need words with plants," the greenhouse keeper had explained, tapping his chest. <words>151</words> "They feel music, feel heart." <words>157</words> Viktor understood now as he navigated between snapping venus flytraps and writhing strangler figs, his gentle humming creating a bubble of safety around him even as the drum solos intensified, making the more aggressive specimens twitch with predatory anticipation. <words>200</words>

At the labyrinth's heart, Viktor discovered a glass chamber where the baton rested on a pedestal of intertwined roots. <words>219</words> The drums reached a thunderous crescendo as he lifted the ivory instrument, surprisingly heavy for its size, covered in symbols he couldn't comprehend. <words>241</words>

When the first plant lunged, Viktor didn't run. <words>249</words> Instead, he swung the baton with unexpected grace for such massive hands, and where it passed, the attacking foliage froze mid-strike. <words>272</words> The drum solo abruptly ended, leaving a silence that felt physical. <words>283</words>

Viktor smiled, remembering his grandmother's stories of a conductor who could command more than just orchestras—who could bridge the gap between life and death, between human and nature. <words>311</words> But as he studied the baton more closely, he realized the twist in his grandmother's tale: the symbols weren't for controlling death, but for speaking the forgotten language of plants. <words>342</words>

With brash confidence belied by tender movements, Viktor began conducting an invisible orchestra, watching in wonder as the plants responded—not attacking but dancing, communicating through movement what no human words could express. <words>376</words> He had come seeking a tool to raise his grandmother from the dead, but found instead a way to understand the living world she had so loved. <words>402</words>

As another drum solo began somewhere beyond the glass walls, Viktor knew he had succeeded in his true quest: to mold a myth from the mud of reality, transforming his grief into something that breathed and grew and reached for the light. <words>442</words> The docile bruiser conducted his botanical choir with tears streaming down his still-calm face, creating a new language where before there had been only barriers. <words>470</words>
