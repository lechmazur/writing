<story>Whispered secrets swirled around the navigation room as Orion fingered his telekinetic dice in his pocket.<words>14</words> The space pirates eyed him warily; outsiders were rarely welcomed on the Nebula’s Curse.<words>28</words> But Orion had something they wanted—a fragment of a medieval tapestry depicting dragons woven in lost languages.<words>46</words> He unrolled the tattered cloth on the starlit table, flames from the holographic displays dancing across its surface.<words>64</words>

“I hear you’re men of chance,” Orion said, his voice steady amid the sacred disorder of charts and contraband.<words>80</words> The captain leaned forward, eyes gleaming. “What’s your game, gambler?”<words>90</words> “A simple throw of dice,” Orion replied, revealing the gleaming cubes that seemed to hum with energy.<words>105</words> The crew whispered among themselves, curious yet cautious.<words>114</words>

“If I win,” Orion continued, “you take me to Terra Nova.

The captain smirked. “And what makes you think we care about farming?”<words>185</words> Orion met his gaze. “Because even pirates need to eat, and resources are dwindling.”<words>198</words> The crew’s whispers grew louder, filling the room with a sacred disorder of thoughts and doubts.<words>213</words>

The captain watched their exchange, a flicker of respect in his eyes.<words>345</words> “Perhaps there’s value in more than just riches,” he mused.<words>355</words> Orion smiled. “Survival often requires us to look back in order to move forward.”<words>369</words>
