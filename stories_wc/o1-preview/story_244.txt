The last petal fell from the withered rosebush outside Ayana's window. <words>11</words> She watched it drift to the ground, a silent signal that time was running out. <words>23</words> Clutching the tribal mask with labyrinthine carvings, she felt the weight of her guilt heavier than ever. <words>39</words> As a swordswoman who had forsaken her oath, Ayana sought redemption in the unknown. <words>53</words> Her gaze moved to the flickering neon sign across the street—the only place left to seek answers. <words>68</words> The old neon sign repair shop glowed dimly in the twilight, its humming lights beckoning her. <words>82</words> Ayana walked in, the mask hidden beneath her cloak. <words>91</words> The shop was cluttered with tangled wires and disassembled signs, but she wasn't here for repairs. <words>106</words> Behind the counter stood Elias, a reservedly bold man known for his half-truths masquerading as history. <words>123</words> "Back again?" he asked, his eyes meeting hers with a knowing glint. <words>134</words> "I need to know how to open the door," she said quietly. <words>145</words> Elias smirked. "Doors to the unknown aren't easily unlocked." <words>157</words> She placed the mask on the counter, its carvings catching the neon light. <words>170</words> "This mask is the key, isn't it?" Ayana pressed. <words>180</words> Elias traced a finger over the intricate patterns. <words>188</words> "Legends speak of a door of release, but who can say what's true?" he replied evasively. <words>203</words> "I've no time for riddles," she said, her voice steady yet intense. <words>215</words> "Then you must pursue the truth yourself," he suggested, gesturing to the back room. <words>229</words> Ayana hesitated but stepped forward, her boldness tempered by caution. <words>241</words> The back room was dim, illuminated only by the soft glow of discarded neon tubes. <words>255</words> Amidst the shadows, she found inscriptions matching those on the mask. <words>266</words> Her heart quickened as she pieced together the clues. <words>276</words> From fragments of half-truths, she gleaned the secret location of the door. <words>289</words> "You're getting warmer," Elias called out from the front. <words>299</words> She returned, eyes filled with determination. <words>307</words> "Tell me the rest," she demanded. <words>314</words> Elias sighed. "The door lies where the first neon light flickered." <words>326</words> "The old district," she realized aloud. <words>333</words> He nodded. "But be warned, opening it may not bring the release you seek." <words>348</words> "I have to try," Ayana whispered, guilt pressing against her chest. <words>360</words> She left the shop, the night air cool against her face. <words>371</words> The streets were empty as she made her way to the abandoned district. <words>384</words> There, beneath the oldest neon sign, she found a hidden doorway marked with familiar carvings. <words>400</words> Holding the mask up, she aligned it with the symbols on the door. <words>411</words> A soft click echoed as the door began to open. <words>421</words> Ayana took a deep breath and stepped into the unknown. <words>432</words> Inside, she faced the shadows of her past—the source of her guilt. <words>444</words> But with each step forward, she felt the weight lifting. <words>454</words> The door of release wasn't an escape but a confrontation. <words>466</words> Emerging back into the night, Ayana felt a serene intensity within. <words>478</words> The final petal had fallen, but a new beginning awaited. <words>489</words> She sheathed her sword, ready to face whatever came next. <words>500</words>
