The train doors sighed open, revealing a carriage bathed in ethereal light. <words>13</words>
Evelyn boarded hesitantly, realizing she'd taken a different train than usual. <words>26</words>
Her notebook clutched tightly, pages filled with sketches of silent plains haunting her dreams. <words>43</words>
An unquenchable zeal propelled her to uncover the source of their mute screams. <words>57</words>
The train ascended into clouds, the city shrinking below, mist shrouding the windows. <words>71</words>
A gentle chime announced, "Next stop—Floating Cloud Café." <words>81</words>
She frowned; she'd never heard of it. <words>88</words>
Curiosity bloomed—a feeling constantly rare in her numbed existence. <words>101</words>
Disembarking onto a platform woven from vapor, she approached the hovering café. <words>115</words>
Inside, whispers of jasmine and distant thunder filled the hush. <words>127</words>
She seated herself by a window, gazing at the endless clouds—a silent plain itself. <words>141</words>
"May I sit here?" a soft voice asked. <words>150</words>
Turning, she saw a man in an embroidered vest shimmering with celestial patterns. <words>164</words>
"Of course," she replied, drawn to his serene presence. <words>175</words>
"I'm a guide," he murmured. <words>181</words>
"What do you guide?" she inquired, fingers tracing her notebook. <words>192</words>
"Those seeking the scream of silent plains," he answered, eyes deep with understanding. <words>207</words>
Her heart quickened; how could he know? <words>216</words>
"Sometimes, the loudest truths lie in quiet places," he said gently. <words>228</words>
Suddenly, an unexplained blackout cloaked the café. <words>238</words>
Instead of fear, tranquility enveloped them. <words>247</words>
"Listen," he whispered. <words>251</words>
She closed her eyes, sensing vast echoes of unspoken stories. <words>263</words>
"It's overwhelming," she breathed, blissful agony coursing through her. <words>276</words>
"Their screams are beyond sound," he told her softly. <words>287</words>
She saw his vest depicted silent plains and stars entwined. <words>297</words>
"Have we met?" she asked. <words>302</words>
"In dreams," he smiled. "I've awaited you." <words>312</words>
As blackout deepened, time slowed. <words>318</words>
"Why do the plains scream silently?" she whispered. <words>327</words>
"Some truths are felt, not heard," he replied. <words>338</words>
"Will you help me understand?" <words>345</words>
"Together," he affirmed. <words>349</words>
When lights returned, she felt lighter, their partnership sealed. <words>362</words>
"Until next time," he nodded, fading away. <words>373</words>
On her way home, words filled her notebook like a flood. <words>384</words>
She had tapped into the silent plains' scream, ready to give it voice. <words>399</words>
