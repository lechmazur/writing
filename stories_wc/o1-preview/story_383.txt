"The Dark Matter Diner floated serenely in the expanse, a speck between rides to nowhere and everywhere."<words>15</words>

"General Marlowe slumped in a corner booth, his gaze lost in the abyss of his cooled coffee."<words>29</words>

"His medals were tarnished, much like his spirit—he was a burnt-out general in a universe that no longer needed wars."<words>51</words>

"A small dish of dried seaweed sat untouched before him, its salty fragrance mingling with the stale aroma of nostalgia."<words>71</words>

"He picked up a brittle piece and crumbled it between his fingers, watching the flakes drift like lost stars."<words>87</words>

"Across the diner, black-and-white photographs adorned the walls, each connected by delicate arcs drawn in silver ink."<words>106</words>

"They depicted explorers, dreamers, and fools—faces etched with the same shared anxieties that haunted his own reflection."<words>128</words>

"Marlowe's eyes traced the arcs, a rationally absurd constellation that seemed to map the labyrinth of his mind."<words>146</words>

"He smirked, a flicker of mischievous wisdom igniting within him."<words>158</words>

"A waitress approached, her apron as dark as the space outside, and refilled his cup without a word."<words>176</words>

"'Funny thing about fear,' she said, nodding toward the photographs."<words>187</words>

"'It sits on the throne of reason until you decide it's not royalty after all.'"<words>204</words>

"He raised an eyebrow. 'And how does one stage such a coup?' he asked."<words>219</words>

"She shrugged. 'By renewing the mind, perhaps—seeing the absurdity in what we deem rational.'"<words>234</words>

"He considered this, stirring his coffee with a piece of seaweed."<words>246</words>

"The bitter brew and the salty tang merged—a rationally absurd combination, yet somehow fitting."<words>262</words>

"He glanced again at the photographs, noticing now that the arcs formed a spiral leading to a mirror at the center."<words>282</words>

"Rising from his seat, he approached the mirror and saw himself among the faces—another soul between rides."<words>300</words>

"In that reflection, he saw not a burnt-out general but a man ready to dethrone fear from his reason."<words>318</words>

"He turned to the waitress. 'I think it's time to renew my journey,' he declared."<words>332</words>

"She winked. 'Safe travels, General. Remember, the universe is rationally absurd—might as well enjoy the ride.'"<words>352</words>

"Marlowe chuckled, pocketing a piece of dried seaweed as a token."<words>364</words>

"He stepped out of the diner, the vastness of space welcoming him like an old friend."<words>379</words>

"Between rides, he had found a moment of clarity, a mischievous wisdom to carry forward."<words>394</words>

"As he launched into the stars, he knew fear no longer commanded his reason; he did."<words>409</words>
