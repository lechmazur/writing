The sun cast long shadows over the abandoned carnival as Alex stood atop the rusted roller coaster track. <words>18</words>
He gripped the antique brass key, its cold weight grounding him amidst rising panic. <words>34</words>
Moments ago, a sudden revelation struck: his secret astral projections were being monitored. <words>52</words>
Someone knew about his hidden ability, and danger was imminent. <words>65</words>
He needed to flee, but not recklessly; practiced spontaneity was his approach. <words>81</words>
Glancing at the sun, he noted the shadows' angles—his method for navigation. <words>96</words>
Tracking sun shadows had preserved his survival skills over the years. <words>112</words>
Time was scarce; every second post-revelation was critical. <words>124</words>

He thought of Lily, who sometimes always appeared in his dreams. <words>153</words>
She, too, was an astral projector, unaware of the looming threat. <words>167</words>
Descending the coaster, Alex moved with swift precision. <words>178</words>
The carnival's silence was broken only by his footsteps. <words>190</words>
He navigated the labyrinth of decaying rides, shadows guiding his path. <words>205</words>
He had to reach Lily before they did. <words>215</words>

His mind raced, but his actions remained controlled. <words>240</words>
Survival required both haste and deliberation. <words>250</words>
Emerging from the carnival, he headed west, shadows stretching before him. <words>266</words>
In the distance, he spotted a figure—Lily. <words>276</words>
"Lily!" he called out, urgency tinging his voice. <words>288</words>
She turned, surprise flashing in her eyes. <words>299</words>
"Alex? What's happening?" she asked. <words>308</words>
"No time to explain—we must flee now." <words>319</words>
Confusion gave way to trust; she nodded. <words>330</words>
They ran together, practiced spontaneity guiding their steps. <words>344</words>
Alex felt the weight of responsibility heavy on his shoulders. <words>359</words>
Their unyielding compassion was both a gift and a burden. <words>373</words>
"Sometimes always," he murmured, recalling the paradox they lived by. <words>388</words>
Lily glanced at him, understanding unspoken between them. <words>401</words>
They had to preserve their survival skills, for themselves and others. <words>416</words>
As the sun dipped lower, they followed the lengthening shadows. <words>430</words>
Behind them, the carnival faded into twilight, secrets left behind. <words>444</words>
Together, they faced the uncertain path ahead, united in purpose. <words>458</words>
Whatever awaited, they would face it with unyielding compassion and practiced spontaneity. <words>477</words>
