The astute hermit gazed upon the cavern cathedral alive with phosphorescent flora, pondering his next move.<words>16</words>
Isolation had taught him many things, including how to fix a water system with a blunt scissor and sheer willpower.<words>38</words>
He chuckled despairingly at his situation; who would have thought saving the world required bread?<words>54</words>
With the water systems failing, he had to amplify the signals for help via the scent of a fresh loaf of bread.<words>77</words>
Strangely effective, the aroma wafted through the cavernous depths, summoning creatures that might aid him.<words>93</words>
He used the blunt scissor to slice the loaf, releasing more of its enticing scent.<words>107</words>
"Just my luck," he muttered, "the fate of water rests in the hands of bread and a dull tool."<words>126</words>
Somewhere above, an elevator arrived to an empty floor, its chime echoing faintly through the subterranean halls.<words>144</words>
He knew that no one would be stepping out; not anymore.<words>155</words>
But perhaps he could send a message upwards, if only he could amplify his signal.<words>169</words>
"I'm a hermit, not a magician," he sighed, yet continued his strange work.<words>182</words>
He arranged the phosphorescent flora into patterns, hoping to create a visual beacon.<words>195</words>
The creatures drawn by the bread's scent began to assist, their luminescence amplifying the light.<words>210</words>
It was a desperate plan, but despairing humor kept him going.<words>221</words>
"Well, this is strangely effective," he admitted as the cavern glowed brighter.<words>232</words>
Above, sensors detected the unusual light, triggering old systems back to life.<words>244</words>
Water began to flow once more through the ancient pipes.<words>254</words>
He watched as a trickle of water emerged, then laughed.<words>264</words>
"Who needs engineers when you've got bread and blunt scissors?"<words>274</words>
The impact of isolation had made him resourceful in the weirdest ways.<words>285</words>
As the elevator doors opened again to an empty floor, he knew he wasn't entirely alone.<words>299</words>
He raised the blunt scissor in a mock toast to the unseen audience.<words>310</words>
"Here's to isolationâ€”strangely effective in saving the day."<words>319</words>
As the water flowed and the cavern sparkled, he felt a glimmer of hope.<words>332</words>
Maybe, just maybe, isolation wasn't so bad after all.<words>341</words>
He sat down to enjoy a slice of bread, waiting to see what tomorrow would bring.<words>355</words>
