When the bus driver completes the final route, a lurking assassin drifts onto the baroque asteroid. <words>16</words>
Borrowed starlight glints through stained glass windows shaped like celestial cherubs. <words>27</words>
He treads across winding corridors adorned with swirling gold filigree and marble reliefs. <words>40</words>
In his coat pocket, a paint-splattered camera lens lies like a silent witness. <words>53</words>
He examines the lens superficially profound, as though depth hides in shallow gloss. <words>66</words>
Outside, the unforgiving road stretches beneath crimson skies like a serpent of rust and bone. <words>81</words>
Every twist and cratered bend promises ambush or despair beyond recall. <words>92</words>
He moves via the pattern of a spider's web after rain, stepping lightly across silk threads of light. <words>110</words>
Each step echoes in grand halls carved from asteroid rock and opalescent crystal. <words>123</words>
His mission remains hidden beneath layers of silent intent. <words>132</words>
The assassin’s motive flickers like a dying ember: to cradle the dawn in trembling hands. <words>147</words>
He hears distant laughter echoing down a corridor spanned with gilded arches. <words>159</words>
A queen draped in comets perches behind a lacquered mahogany bar and laughs. <words>172</words>
Her laugh rings fragile and wild like glass struck by starlight. <words>183</words>
He glances at the paint-splattered lens and imagines frozen moments of betrayal and beauty. <words>197</words>
Shadows dance across twisted columns carved into the curved spine of the asteroid. <words>210</words>
He follows the echo of that borrowed starlight laugh down a spiral staircase. <words>223</words>
The unforgiving road beyond awaits his final revelation. <words>231</words>
A single pool of moonlight reveals his silhouette against the baroque columns. <words>243</words>
He raises the camera lens to his eye and sees dawn trembling at the horizon. <words>258</words>
In that fragile glow, he finds purpose beyond mere death. <words>268</words>
He laughs softly, a superficially profound sound that trembles with hope. <words>279</words>
Then he steps onto the unforgiving road, each footfall precise and unyielding. <words>291</words>
The baroque asteroid recedes as he moves toward the eastern sky. <words>302</words>
He carries the lens like a cradle for dawn’s fragile bloom. <words>313</words>
Stars whisper secrets overhead, illuminating his path with borrowed starlight and quiet longing. <words>326</words>
Rainwater patterns glisten on broken glass fragments, like spiderweb maps guiding his march. <words>339</words>
He remembers when joy felt as fragile as dew on a silk thread. <words>352</words>
Now every heartbeat resonates with the solemn promise of sunrise. <words>362</words>
His laughter fades into the hush of dawn, echoing once through hollow craters before silence returns. <words>378</words>
He raises trembling hands and watches the first ray fracture across the lens. <words>391</words>
In that quiet instance, he relinquishes the hunt and embraces a fragile rebirth. <words>404</words>
The paint-splattered lens, a testament to violence and beauty entwined, shimmers as he steps forward along the unforgiving road towards a new day. <words>427</words>
