An irate smuggler jogs along the cracked metal panels of an abandoned spaceport flight deck under a dull alien sky. <words>20</words>
His breathing is ragged but precise, each footfall echoing against rusted hangar walls as he seeks hidden waterfalls rumored to survive in this forgotten wasteland. <words>45</words>
His anger simmers like caffeinated acid because months ago he lost his cargo and his only solace has been this minimalist ritual. <words>67</words>
In a battered thermos he carries a precious single chopstick, its wood worn and engraved with a cryptic insignia from his former life. <words>90</words>
Each morning during jogging he pauses at a shattered console to memorialize broken promises and fallen comrades through patterns in tea leaves. <words>112</words>
He swirls steaming liquid with the chopstick until abstract symbols scatter across a chipped porcelain saucer like constellations of regret. <words>132</words>
He calls this act a rebellion of the heart, an abstractly physical uprising against the emptiness that trolls him every step. <words>153</words>
This core concept of the heart's revolt pulses through his veins with biting sincerity, a truth he refuses to ignore. <words>173</words>
Steam hisses from broken grout as alien wind whips the deck and dust rakes his lungs, but his resolve remains solid. <words>194</words>
He imagines veils of falling water, hidden cascades spilling into crystalline pools that might wash away his guilt. <words>212</words>
Every drip of tea stirred with the chopstick echoes like distant waterfalls he chases across star systems. <words>229</words>
In those swirling leaves he reads memorial glyphs that map pain to purpose, sorrow to stubborn hope. <words>246</words>
His heart's revolt feels tangible beneath ribs bruised by betrayal, a restless drumbeat urging him onward. <words>262</words>
He dares to hope that somewhere beyond the silent docking arms and shattered landing spot there lies salvation in moving water. <words>283</words>
Each day concludes with bitter tea rituals, the chopstick carving lines of memory into his flesh like a living testament. <words>303</words>
His solitude is punctuated only by the hiss of coolant vents and the rasp of his own impatience. <words>321</words>
Still, he clings to the irrational promise that hidden waterfalls will heal and that memorial patterns can anchor a fragmented soul. <words>342</words>
On the fifteenth dawn he notices a shimmer beyond the broken landing bay, a thin curtain of mist drifting against gravity. <words>363</words>
His heart convulses with genuine fury and joy as he races toward the mist, single chopstick clutched like a sword. <words>383</words>
He discerns the faint roar of water against steel and understands that this is the waterfall he has been chasing, earthly and wild. <words>406</words>
In the spray's prism he sees etched in droplets the last memorial he will need, a pattern traced by a trembling chopstick. <words>428</words>
He plunges into the pool where biofluorescent moss glows and each pulse of water feels like the heart's revolt finally fulfilled. <words>449</words>
His rage dissolves in biting clarity, washed away by the waterfalls he memorialized long before he could find them. <words>468</words>
Under the alien sky he stands reborn, the single chopstick held aloft as witness to his revolt. <words>485</words>
