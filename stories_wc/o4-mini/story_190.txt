The drought prediction center hummed with hollow excitement as technicians monitored shifting moisture indices. <words>14</words>
A cautious smuggler named Arlo moved between glass consoles with enthusiastic apathy in his gaze. <words>29</words>
He clutched a pressed butterfly in a leather satchel as though it held every rainstorm he had ever traded. <words>48</words>
Inside the forecast chamber, confessions under anesthesia yielded unpredictable data from local artists desperate to articulate drought through color and voice. <words>69</words>
Arlo's method combined scientific rigor with delirious confessions under anesthesia to predict the shifting moods of barren earth. <words>87</words>
