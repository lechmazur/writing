Her bitterly optimistic resolve shimmered between fleeting specters of fragmented reality as she tested the station’s gravity anomalies, <words>33</words>
Clutching an old parking stub from a derelict shuttle port, she sought a clue to unify the drifting shards of her identity and scientific proofs, <words>58</words>
She was driven by a determination to push the limits of possibility beyond spatial and cognitive constraints, <words>75</words>
During the migration of clouds overhead the station windows trembled under shifting pressures, <words>88</words>
Her plan included a detour to avoid simulated traffic in the transit bay that led to a secret scenic overlook carved into a basalt ridge, <words>113</words>
She navigated the narrow path with reckless precision, scanning alien flora for resonance frequencies that might stabilize her broken perception, <words>133</words>
