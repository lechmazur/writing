<story>
The convicted dream thief crouches among dusty shelves in a forgotten library inside a treehouse. <words>15</words>
He flips through a flimsy photo album that trembles with faded images of laughter and lost games. <words>32</words>
Time feels suspended after the last human is born and no new voices echo in the sky or halls. <words>51</words>
A quiet mania hums in his chest as he plans to coax thunder from empty skies by any means. <words>70</words>
He remembers the fragmented self he once was before sunlight became myth and memory fragmented into shards. <words>87</words>
His conviction for pilfering dreams left him mathematically challenged when calculating the precise moment to strike a chord of thunder. <words>107</words>
Yet he relies on a shared love for a certain sport with the forest’s ancient spirit to guide his ritual. <words>127</words>
They shot hoops with whispering branches and practiced silent passes under moonlight while the library’s tomes watched. <words>144</words>
Tonight he sets the flimsy album beneath a skylight carved into oak bark to gather fragments of storm. <words>162</words>
He measures time with desperate drums of his heart but miscounts each breath in his mania. <words>178</words>
A sudden creak echoes as he prepares to plunge into a vision woven from stolen reveries. <words>194</words>
The forest spirit leans close and murmurs strategy in rhythms borrowed from shared games and half remembered plays. <words>212</words>
He hesitates because arithmetic dissolves in his mind and he cannot count the beats needed for thunder. <words>229</words>
Still he flips pages of the album, each image a shard urging him forward into fractured consciousness. <words>246</words>
He recalls the roar of crowds in stadiums that never existed, binding him closer to hope. <words>262</words>
In quiet frenzy he murmurs play calls like incantations, certain they will summon distant thunderheads. <words>277</words>
Lightning flickers in the brittle pages while his heart races in uneven time, divorced from normal arithmetic. <words>294</words>
He leaps forward and plunges his hand into the album, seeking a deep current of collected dreams. <words>311</words>
Pages flutter like trapped birds until they rest on a photograph of two barefoot players on cracked concrete. <words>329</words>
He whispers the names he cannot calculate into the wind, certain that each syllable will crack the silent sky. <words>348</words>
A distant rumble answers like a slow clap, ancient and forgiving, as if the sky remembered its own pulse. <words>367</words>
The fractured self within him quivers and knits itself whole around that promise of sound and fury. <words>384</words>
He rises, soaked in trembling triumph, clutching the flimsy album like a trophy of silent rebellion. <words>400</words>
Above the treetops arc faint tendrils of violet lightning, a quiet triumph birthed from his manic devotion. <words>417</words>
In that suspended moment he forgives his errors in arithmetic and welcomes the sky’s fractured symphony. <words>433</words>
The shadowed volumes of the forgotten library seem to sigh as echoes of thunder pulse through bark and bone. <words>452</words>
He tucks the album close, a fragile testament to his conquest of empty skies in the silence after humanity. <words>471</words>
