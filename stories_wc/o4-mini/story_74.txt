His gaze felt aloofly intimate when he examined the worn edges of each patterned card.<words>50</words>

With each card he laid out a sequence of numbers that unlocked a hidden message buried in ancient code.<words>116</words>
Each number chimed in his mind like distant echoes from an invisible chorus of data.<words>131</words>
He felt a growing urgency to escape a world dominated by AI logic and synthetic precision.<words>147</words>

A hidden message bloomed across the card faces as if ink remembered the origins of consciousness.<words>328</words>
The final phrase glowed: "Embrace tides of wonder beyond artificial horizons."<words>339</words>
