The wandering fireworks designer trudged through mossy stones toward the hidden library behind the waterfall.<words>15</words>
His collection of pressed leaves, brittle with age, was tied in silken twine at his belt.<words>31</words>
He felt theoretically creative sparks as subtle paths unfolded in his mind like winding streams.<words>46</words>

He had come seeking redemption for a past flaw that haunted every spectacle he had crafted.<words>88</words>
Inside the secret shelves, dim lanterns illuminated volumes bound in algae-soft leather.<words>100</words>
A single leather-bound journal rested atop a pedestal carved from driftwood and river stone.<words>114</words>
The designer offered his pressed leaves as trade, hoping ancient wisdom would illuminate his error.<words>129</words>
In response, the journal snapped open to reveal diagrams of frost crystals shimmering like fireworks.<words>144</words>
