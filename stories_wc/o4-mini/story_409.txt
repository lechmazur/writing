At the moment a sculptor’s chisel first strikes marble, a bruised fighter staggers into a dusty attic filled with clockwork animals. <words>21</words>
His knuckles still bruised, the fighter feels every rasp of dust against raw skin as he navigates jars of gears and tin sparrows. <words>44</words>
Although skillfully incompetent in delicate maneuvers, he trusts that destiny led him here to stand for something he barely understands. <words>64</words>
He paws through broken puppets and mechanical rabbits until a moonbeam catches on a clay pot shard with an inscription. <words>84</words>
The inscription reads: Stand where illusions shatter and the truth endures. <words>95</words>
In that echoing phrase he recognizes his purpose: to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception that haunts his dreams. <words>114</words>
He recalls the forbidden ritual that can abduct consciousness through forgotten dreams and knows he must attempt it tonight. <words>133</words>
A single clockwork fox whirs to life under his touch, its brass gears clicking in timid protest. <words>150</words>
He positions the shard at his brow and closes his eyes, feeling the attic dissolve around him. <words>167</words>
Through forgotten dreams he drifts into a marble hall where dust motes glimmer like distant stars. <words>183</words>
In that fleeting realm, a sculptor’s chisel first strikes marble once more, echoing destiny’s rhythm in his blood. <words>201</words>
He sees statues twisted by lies and years of self-deception, their perfect features cracking like brittle bone. <words>218</words>
With a groan of effort he summons resolve and crushes phantom marble at his feet, shattering illusions. <words>235</words>
The realm trembles, and memories of failures surface, each one a tether to self-deception he must sever. <words>252</words>
He feels the last shred of denial fall away as dawn horns echo in his mind. <words>268</words>
When he opens his eyes the attic lies silent, bathed in pale morning light that traces every dent on his battered armor. <words>290</words>
The clay pot shard lies warm in his palm, its whispered promise etched deeper than any blade. <words>307</words>
Though he remains skillfully incompetent at delicate magic, his conviction is unwavering and fierce. <words>321</words>
He stands in that dusty cavern of memories, now resolute, a bruised fighter who finally stands for something real. <words>340</words>
Each ticking creature around him feels like a heartbeat in solidarity with his oath. <words>354</words>
He steps away with the shard held close, ready to face the world without illusion. <words>369</words>
In that moment he knows he will never again be deceived by whispered lies or his own desperate hopes. <words>388</words>
The attic’s quiet fades as he descends, carrying both pain and purpose into a waking world that awaits his truth. <words>408</words>
Through each breath he honors the shard’s command and stands unbowed, a fighter reborn in clear purpose. <words>425</words>
