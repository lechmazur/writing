In an abandoned waiting area, the subdued vigilante attended virtual calls amid screaming silence. <words>14</words>
He was driven by a singular motivation to master an ancient art that demanded patience and precision. <words>31</words>
Clutching a plain wooden bead between trembling fingertips, he treated it as both artifact and beacon. <words>47</words>
His artfully clumsy gestures centered on tracking distortions in an antique funhouse mirror propped against rusted walls. <words>64</words>
As the glass warped his silhouette, he learned to flatter the mirror's illusions with delicate wrist flicks. <words>81</words>
Each shimmering bend of reflection reminded him of the price of war etched into his lineage. <words>97</words>
He bore scars beneath his mask that spoke of battles fought in silent streets and broken treaties. <words>114</words>
While colleagues on the virtual calls discussed mundane metrics, he tuned them out to refine each motion. <words>131</words>
The abandoned waiting area yawned around him, rows of empty seats echoing a screaming silence that matched his heart. <words>150</words>
Between distorted frames in the glass, he rolled the wooden bead to calibrate angles and correct overreaches. <words>167</words>
Despite his artfully clumsy beginnings, each misstep became a lesson in balance and focus. <words>181</words>
Nightly patrols resumed his secretive crusade, but in the mirrored distortions he saw a path to mastery rather than vengeance alone. <words>202</words>
He understood that every silent reflection carried the weight of lives lost and peace deferred, the true price of war. <words>222</words>
To flatter the fractured images, he practiced subtle wrist rotations and breath control during the hoarse hum of video conferences. <words>242</words>
His subdued demeanor masked a turbulent soul, hungry to transform silent war memories into fluid motion. <words>258</words>
Dust motes danced in fractured light beams while the waiting area, abandoned and hollow, served as his clandestine dojo. <words>277</words>
At intervals, a ping from the virtual call jolted his focus, yanking him back to everyday expectations. <words>294</words>
In a fleeting moment, he saw his reflection straighten perfectly, the mirror's warped angles obediently flattering his intent. <words>312</words>
But that perfect curve carried a toll, reminding him that mastery always demanded sacrifice. <words>326</words>
He envisioned every fallen comrade whose silent pleas echoed in that glass. <words>338</words>
Setting down the bead gently on a chipped seat, he made a vow to wield his ancient art with compassion rather than vengeance. <words>361</words>
In that screaming silence, his softened resolve mirrored the one flawless curve on the funhouse glass. <words>377</words>
He rose slowly. <words>380</words>
The bead remained still. <words>384</words>
Mirrors held both truth and deception. <words>390</words>
Virtual calls droned on. <words>394</words>
He stepped into silent duty. <words>399</words>
Ancient art and modern war entwined. <words>405</words>
His vigil had just begun. <words>410</words>
Screaming silence guided him. <words>414</words>
