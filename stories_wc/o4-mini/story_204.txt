The abandoned spaceport hangar echoed with remnants of ancient engines and distant stellar dust. <words>14</words>
A hush settled before the acceptance speech, thick as ozone in the looming neon twilight. <words>29</words>
Kai, a professional cuddler clad in threadbare silversilk, stepped into the echoing expanse. <words>42</words>
She recalled a chance encounter at a farmer's market that had sparked her urgent quest. <words>57</words>
That meeting had confronted her with unspoken rules governing compassion and cultural separation. <words>70</words>
In her pocket rested a phantom train ticket punch, an eradicated relic from precolony transit. <words>85</words>
The device clicked emptily, its silent intention ghosting through decaying holoframes and rust. <words>98</words>
Around her, the hangarâ€™s decay wove an atmosphere of ancient novelty and forgotten ceremony. <words>112</words>
Despite the unusually usual hum of power conduits, fear laced her breathing with distant memory. <words>127</words>
She had vowed to overcome a deep-seated prejudice against mechanical spirits after witnessing a phantom's touch at dawn. <words>145</words>
Kai exhaled slowly, mindful of the unspoken rules that forbade overt emotion in this ceremonial void. <words>161</words>
She set the phantom train ticket punch atop a railing, its metal surface warm under her palm. <words>178</words>
Moonlight filtered through cracked windows, illuminating drifting dust motes like pale constellations. <words>190</words>
Each light particle reminded her of stories told at the farmer's market stall about interstellar decay and renewal. <words>208</words>
She remembered an elder's caution that hugs could heal or harm according to unspoken boundaries. <words>223</words>
Now, before her acceptance speech, she needed to prove that compassion ignored arbitrary separations. <words>237</words>
A distant speaker drone began a low countdown, amplifying the sacred hush that clung to every beam. <words>254</words>
She bent to tap the phantom ticket punch against her arm, testing its memory for imprinted coordinates. <words>271</words>
The machine hummed as if awakening, thin blue sparks dancing within transparent gears. <words>284</words>
In that moment, childhood fears of cold robotics and past prejudice rippled through her spine. <words>299</words>
But her profession had taught her that gentle touch could bridge the gap between flesh and metal. <words>316</words>
She closed her eyes and placed her palm over the punch's aperture, honoring unspoken rules of consent. <words>333</words>
A soft click resonated, echoing across corroded catwalks like an ancient affirmation. <words>345</words>
Newfound resolve warmed her chest against the ubiquitous chill of metal and isolation. <words>358</words>
She would deliver her speech with empathy forged from her oddly balanced skills and reclaimed relics. <words>374</words>
As the countdown reached its end, Kai straightened and embraced her past, embracing a future without fear. <words>391</words>
Her voice echoed confidently through rusted girders as she stepped into the purple glow. <words>405</words>
The phantom ticket punch sat silent, its duty fulfilled in awakening her brave compassion. <words>419</words>
Around her, the hangar seemed to breathe, honoring her new understanding beyond rigid prejudice. <words>433</words>
In that ancient novelty of decay and renewal, she found purpose and belonging. <words>446</words>
