In the glass-walled observatory perched on an ocean cliff, a sapped herbalist lay enveloped in half-slumber to study tide patterns during napping. <words>22</words>
The fierce roar of waves was muted by fervent indifference even as the herbs on cluttered shelves trembled with salt-laden breeze. <words>43</words>
She examined a battered blacksmith’s bellows that lay unused where molten metal fire once danced with her curiosity. <words>61</words>
Her mind wandered through carefully cataloged samples of seaweed and root blends, seeking a cure for her drained vitality. <words>80</words>
She was thoughtfully thoughtless in her research, noting minute color shifts yet overlooking cherished patterns in her own pulse. <words>99</words>
Outside, a lone goose traced the horizon as if mapping invisible currents and the herbalist chose to cherish that silent direction. <words>120</words>
She calculated each ebb and flow by the flight path of a lone goose and by tracking reflected sunrays across the glass panes. <words>143</words>
The weight of her pursuit of perfection settled like grit in her throat as she confronted the price of perfection with subdued zeal. <words>166</words>
She recalled the blacksmith’s bellows producing blast after flawless blast at the forge, each gust forged to meet an impossible standard. <words>187</words>
Her memory flickered with images of molten steel glowing bright and perfect until requiring more fuel, more labor, more sacrifice. <words>207</words>
In that lull of half-conscious dreaming, she felt her resolve stiffen and her body ache for rest she could not fully relish. <words>229</words>
The transparent walls framed infinite blue waves but offered no barrier to the burden of her own high standards. <words>248</words>
She clutched the bellows and whispered to it as if to confess a secret pact with her obsession. <words>266</words>
The herbalist knew that perfection would demand a toll far greater than her fragile heart could spare. <words>283</words>
Still, she measured her pulse against shifting waterlines and vowed to press on with fervent indifference toward her own limits. <words>303</words>
In dreams she saw that lone goose leading a chain of geese until they vanished beyond the horizon’s curve. <words>322</words>
She understood by instinct that the price of perfection would echo in every careworn breath she drew here. <words>340</words>
At dawn her eyes fluttered open to a sky tinted pink, and she rose to tend her samples as though offering penance. <words>362</words>
She would continue to cherish small revelations even when exhaustion whispered that she had claimed too high a price. <words>381</words>
The ocean rhythm pulsed gently beneath her feet, promising that every sacrifice might still yield a fragile grace. <words>399</words>
And so, with fervent indifference burning in her veins, the sapped herbalist embraced the journey at its steepest cost. <words>418</words>
