<story>
A tired swordsman sat alone in the floating rock monastery breakroom after a fellow warrior resigned. <words>16</words>
His gaze wandered to a plain cloth bag resting on a worn wooden table by the shattered window. <words>34</words>
He was fiercely apathetic to the chatter of monks drifting from the temple hall. <words>48</words>
Yet beneath his hardened calm a spark of defiance glimmered with naive optimism. <words>61</words>
He clutched the plain cloth bag as though it contained the fragile hinge between despair and resolve. <words>78</words>
A hidden promise to himself pulsed like a secret heartbeat urging him onward. <words>91</words>
Outside, meteor showers traced luminous arcs over churning violet skies above the drifting pinnacles. <words>105</words>
He believed by following meteor showers he might overcome the lethargy that weighed his spirit down. <words>121</words>
Shards of starlight danced on his steel blade as he rose. <words>132</words>
His muscles ached with the burden of his journey yet he stood with determined innocence. <words>147</words>
The breakroom’s silence felt sacred in the wake of departure and sudden emptiness. <words>160</words>
He remembered the vow he had sealed beneath falling meteors long ago on a distant cliff. <words>176</words>
Knowing naivety guided his reckless heart toward redemption beyond mere survival. <words>187</words>
He stepped onto a platform overlooking the monastery’s vertigo-inducing chasms. <words>197</words>
His shadow stretched long across roiling mist and ancient prayer flags. <words>208</words>
A flicker of wind carried the scent of incense and latent desperation from silent corridors. <words>223</words>
He recalled the moment the former warrior clasped his shoulder and walked away. <words>236</words>
The regret of absence threatened to consume his resolve but he breathed shallow determination. <words>250</words>
He untied the cloth bag to reveal a simple scroll tied with a crimson ribbon. <words>265</words>
That document contained promises no voice had witnessed and no ceremony had blessed. <words>278</words>
He closed his eyes against the glare of distant meteors and felt their pull. <words>292</words>
By following meteor showers he believed he could reshape fate itself and honor his silent vow. <words>308</words>
The knowledge of his own ignorance infused him with gentle courage. <words>319</words>
Steel whispered in his hand as he sheathed doubt with each deliberate breath. <words>332</words>
He stepped from the breakroom into moonlight splashed upon shifting boulders and walked forth. <words>346</words>
A final meteor streaked across sky and ignited the spark of defiance burning in his chest. <words>362</words>
Though fiercely apathetic he finally felt alive in that sacred moment of silent rebellion. <words>376</words>
He would overcome his weary spirit by chasing meteor trails toward horizons unknown. <words>389</words>
With knowing naivety lighting his way he ventured into the void beyond the monastery’s stones. <words>404</words>
The plain cloth bag thumped against his side as a companion in his solitary quest. <words>419</words>
The sparkling arcs above whispered that even a tired swordsman could rewrite destiny. <words>432</words>
He marched toward dawn uncertain yet resolved to honor the promise he alone remembered. <words>446</words>
