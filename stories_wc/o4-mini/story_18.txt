Late nights saw the statue tracing margins of schematics, ink pooling like tears that hardened into protective lacquer against rain and soot. <words>304</words>
In the dim dawn, a seamstress orphan paused, her fingers brushing the hair tie, drawn by an inexplicable bond to the silent sentinel. <words>327</words>

Their minds intertwined in a shared vow to unmask the city’s illusions, guiding innocents through brass labyrinths toward hidden truths. <words>366</words>
