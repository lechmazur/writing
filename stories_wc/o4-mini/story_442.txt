<story>
An edgy tradesman crouched beneath the cap of a giant mushroom house interior, its glowing gills dripping with damp shadow. <words>20</words>
His boots scuffed the fungus floor as the final rotation of a forgotten windmill moaned somewhere beyond the curved wooden walls. <words>41</words>
He pressed a torn corner of a flyer between soot-stained fingers, tracing a phrase that blurred like an old photograph in rain. <words>63</words>
Comfortingly pessimistic thoughts curled through his mind as he imagined the distortion of memory fracturing each recollection into shifting fragments. <words>83</words>
He needed to vectorize those fragments, to map their chaotic edges into coherent lines, even if the effort tasted like ash. <words>104</words>
His method depended on two synchronized watches strapped to opposite wrists, ticking in perfect uneasy unison with the windmill’s last spin. <words>125</words>
Through a haze of phosphorescent spores, he studied the flyer fragment, hunting coordinates scrawled in ink that pulsed with quiet authority. <words>146</words>
He imagined the mushroom walls bending into an endless void beyond a sealed door, a void he would soon enter bearing a single flickering candle. <words>171</words>
In that dark expanse he would anchor memory against oblivion by tracing every delicate filigree with trembling light. <words>189</words>
He inhaled the damp air as the windmill blade creaked once more, and his heart thudded with solemn expectancy. <words>208</words>
Shadows flickered across mushroom pillars like memories half-forgotten, as if the house itself participated in his calculations. <words>225</words>
He synchronized his watches one last time, aligning their hands to the windmill’s final beat before the mechanism fell silent forever. <words>246</words>
As the second hand of one watch brushed the minute mark, a hatch yawned open at the room’s edge, revealing a swirl of obsidian emptiness. <words>271</words>
He lifted the torn flyer piece closer to the pulse of his watches, the ink glimmering like a star chart in his palm. <words>294</words>
With a measured breath he stepped into the void, the candle trembling as if remembering warmth it had never known. <words>314</words>
Inside that infinite dark, his comfortingly pessimistic conviction burned brighter than any memory, guiding each flicker toward fragile truth. <words>333</words>
Time dissolved as past and present warped into a blurry vividness where the distortion of memory became both map and maze. <words>354</words>
He trailed the candlelight along invisible filaments, vectorizing the shadowy tapestry of recollection with the precision of his synchronized watches. <words>374</words>
Every heartbeat of his timekeepers echoed against hollow corridors of oblivion, anchoring him to hope and dread in equal measure. <words>394</words>
Emerging at last into a dim chamber of memory’s core, he held the candle high, watching shadows reel into coherent sequence. <words>415</words>
He pressed the flyer fragment against a luminous glyph on the wall, and the mushrooms shivered in silent recognition. <words>434</words>
In that moment the distorted echoes of his life realigned, each memory vector rendered with painful clarity. <words>451</words>
The tradesman exhaled into the quiet that followed, comfortingly pessimistic but unafraid as the candle’s flame met the void. <words>470</words>
He had vectorized his past via synchronized watches, carried a flickering candle through endless darkness, and reclaimed his memory from oblivion. <words>491</words>
