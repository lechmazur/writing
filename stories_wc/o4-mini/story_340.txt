Arlo Ferro balanced on a rickety veranda as dusk painted the Amazonian treehouse city violet with mist and magic. <words>19</words>
He was a proud exorcist whose endearingly feisty manner concealed a formidable skill with spirits and curses. <words>36</words>
Clutched against his chest lay a wizard’s battered grimoire full of cryptic incantations and faded sketches. <words>52</words>
Tonight, when the clock dares to skip a beat, rumors whispered that spectral vines threatened to overrun the canopy walk. <words>72</words>
His motivation burned bright: to outshine a looming shadow that had haunted his reputation since the Great Aracuan Exorcism. <words>91</words>
A sudden closure of a usual path jolted Arlo from his vigil as a twisted wooden bridge collapsed without warning. <words>111</words>
Below, devoted villagers scrambled, their lanterns wobbling through the humid gloom. <words>122</words>
The crowd’s anxious murmurs weighed on him like chains of unseen debt, reminding him of the burden he bore. <words>141</words>
Arlo flipped through the fragile pages of the grimoire seeking a youthify charm to bolster his fading vigor. <words>159</words>
He muttered playful cynicism between syllables to steady his nerves, fooling neither spirit nor self. <words>174</words>
When he pressed the ink-black clasp, a tremor shook the treehouse pillars as if the forest itself gasped. <words>192</words>
Light flickered on the rickety walls and Arlo envisioned his younger face, limbs limber with reckless zeal. <words>209</words>
He cast the youthify incantation, hoping to feel invincible enough to protect the precarious bridges overhead. <words>225</words>
But as ancient runes shimmered, another tremor buckled the rope cables, and time itself warped in staccato beats. <words>243</words>
The clock dared to skip a beat, and Arlo stumbled into a younger skin with bright eyes and brash confidence. <words>263</words>
A mocking grin curved his lips as he felt the gravity of responsibility falter, replaced by heady exhilaration. <words>281</words>
He flashed through makeshift guard towers, dazzling villagers with acrobatic leaps and a wink that chased away dread. <words>299</words>
Yet the interface of youth and power felt brittle, like a borrowed mask about to shatter. <words>315</words>
Above, the looming shadow manifested as a daunting silhouette of a winged specter spiraling down the liana maze. <words>333</words>
Arlo gripped the wizard’s battered grimoire and steadied his breath, recalling each onerous vow he had sworn. <words>350</words>
He laughed in playful cynicism, acknowledging that responsibility weighed heavier than youth but gleamed more fiercely than fear. <words>368</words>
With a fervent invocation from the battered tome, he banished the specter into the humid night with radiant conviction. <words>387</words>
The city erupted in cheers as dawn’s rose light filtered through verdant branches. <words>400</words>
Arlo’s smile betrayed knowing pride. <words>405</words>
