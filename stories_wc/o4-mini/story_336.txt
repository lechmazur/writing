In the hush after a car backfires in a silent street, a weary undertaker paused under moonlight. <words>17</words>
He slipped through towering marble columns of an ancient Persian palace reimagined in his mind’s fading glow. <words>34</words>
Within those ghostly halls, an astronomical clock stood silent, its intricate gears spinning with rarely practical precision. <words>51</words>
The undertaker’s calloused fingers traced engraved constellations, recalling tribal knowledge passed down in whispers by candlelight. <words>67</words>
That lore taught him to imprison lost souls within bronze compartments, aligning locks by following sun paths. <words>84</words>
He wielded placid ferocity, each breath steady yet burning with refusal to surrender to hopeless night. <words>100</words>
Despite the palace’s opulent decay and silent corridors, he sought to harness that cosmic mechanism against oblivion. <words>117</words>
Moonbeams filtered through latticed windows, marking shifting shadows that acted as ephemeral clock hands. <words>131</words>
He recalled ancient diagrams etched on crumbling scrolls, diagrams only a select few could decipher. <words>146</words>
That tribal knowledge seemed rarely practical in a world seized by chaos, yet it was his singular salvation. <words>164</words>
He calibrated tiny brass levers at precise solar alignments, hoping to lock darkness itself behind metal gates. <words>181</words>
Each compartment imprisoned despair and doubt, stilled within mechanized tombs until dawn’s first promise. <words>195</words>
Outside, the city remained arrested in starlit silence, its streets deserted after that single car backfire. <words>211</words>
He welcomed the hush, for without its cocoon he feared his fragile resolve might fracture. <words>226</words>
Each tick of the grand clock echoed like a heartbeat in empty corridors. <words>239</words>
In that silent palace, time felt malleable, bending to his studied patterns from ancient sun charts. <words>255</words>
Memories stirred of panicked mourners, their pleas drowned in darkness until he provided his strange sanctuary. <words>271</words>
He believed imprisoning collective grief would yield a flicker of dawn within his own heart. <words>286</words>
His duty as an undertaker felt entwined with cosmic cycles, a role both sacred and burdensome. <words>302</words>
Night’s deep velvet pressed against cracked walls as he adjusted the clock’s cerulean face by starlight. <words>318</words>
He fought despair with methodical calm, aware that darkness obeyed the sun’s secret routes more than mortal pleas. <words>336</words>
Each morning he trusted to break these locks felt like a testament to enduring hope against an all-consuming gloom. <words>355</words>
When the first rays pierced the horizon, he expected freeing breath rather than chains of shadow. <words>371</words>
But dawn arrived fragmented, scattering slivers of light that fell asleep before warming the palace floors. <words>387</words>
Undeterred, the undertaker tightened golden screws, channeling placid ferocity into every decisive motion. <words>400</words>
At last, a low chime resonated, promising that imprisoned darkness had relinquished its hold. <words>414</words>
He exhaled, feeling hope unfurl like petals at dawn, fragile yet undeniably present. <words>427</words>
In that moment, the palace seemed to breathe alongside him, ancient stones glimmering with renewed purpose. <words>443</words>
Armed with tribal knowledge and the astronomical clock’s stubborn wisdom, he embraced the coming day. <words>458</words>
The weary undertaker stepped into sunlight, determined to guard hope against the encroaching void. <words>472</words>
Even if the world forgot his solitary vigil, he would remain, steadfast as the clock’s eternal cycle. <words>489</words>
