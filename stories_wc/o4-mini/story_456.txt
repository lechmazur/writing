A morbid florist stood alone on a floating rock dojo as twilight bled into the horizon. <words>16</words>
In the last flicker of a guttering lantern the air felt heavy with unsung oaths and quiet dread. <words>34</words>
She carried a plain white candle in one delicate hand and a lock of black rose petals in the other. <words>54</words>
Her eyes were neutrally passionate windows into a heart both curious and cautious about cosmic rhythms. <words>70</words>
Tonight she had come to oblige an ancient ritual recorded through the backlog of typed pages in a writer's trunk. <words>90</words>
Her tempered beliefs whispered that this dim ceremony might reveal truths of birth death and rebirth. <words>106</words>
Stones drifted lazily beneath her feet as she knelt upon moss and ink stained slate. <words>121</words>
The dojo orbited a silent void where the night wind carried fragments of forgotten stars. <words>136</words>
She struck flint against stone and ignited the candle wick with trembling resolve. <words>149</words>
The pale flame danced defiantly in the gusts that threatened to snuff it into oblivion. <words>164</words>
Her breath caught as whispers of cosmic cycles pulsed through her veins urging silent communion. <words>179</words>
Memories of wilted petals and elegies she had arranged flooded her consciousness like spectral petals. <words>194</words>
She traced the rune carved on the candle's base and felt her courage swell timidly. <words>209</words>
Each flicker expanded her vision until she perceived the silent dance of galactic births and collapses. <words>225</words>
Her blood thrummed with reverence yet quivered with fear at the infinite loops before her. <words>240</words>
In that moment she understood why she had been summoned across emptiness to this drifting sanctum. <words>256</words>
She scanned the backlog of typed pages in the writer's trunk for the final incantation. <words>271</words>
Her hands shook as she recited archaic syllables that echoed through the void and into her soul. <words>288</words>
The candle flared golden and revealed veils between moments showing cycles of creation swirling endlessly. <words>303</words>
Tears of ash and joy slid down her cheeks as she bowed humbly to the universe she barely dared to name. <words>324</words>
Her neutrally passionate soul had found balance in tempered belief woven with wonder and restraint. <words>339</words>
She rose at last in boldly timid grace and exhaled gratitude into the cosmic void. <words>354</words>
Behind her the lantern guttered its final breath and the dojo drifted into silent night. <words>369</words>
In that sacred hush she vowed to share her tempered beliefs with anyone brave enough to listen. <words>386</words>
The plain white candle burned down to its stub leaving only memory and purpose where shadows once reigned. <words>404</words>
She stepped beyond the edge of the floating rock dojo and returned to the world forever altered. <words>421</words>
Her journey to understand cosmic cycles had only just begun yet she carried its promise with gentle intensity. <words>439</words>
And so the morbid florist walked onward into the unknown with the plain white candle extinguished and her heart ablaze. <words>459</words>
