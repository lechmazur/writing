A closed-off reaver slouched beneath the tulip-lanterns of kaleidoscope park, staring at a child’s drawing on crumpled paper that fluttered in the neon breeze. <words>24</words>
The scene struck him as charmingly grotesque, a carnival of warped laughter echoing over pastel grass strewn with mirrors. <words>43</words>
He had wandered here before the first lie is told, in that fragile moment of pure truth when secrets still taste like dew. <words>66</words>
Ink stains on the paper whispered of generational patterns, each loop and scrawl a legacy of hunger and hope passed down like a secret heirloom. <words>91</words>
A hidden voice nagged him via scrawled poems in the margins, her verses dancing around monstrous doodles of wailing faces. <words>111</words>
Each line teased him with crooked promises of starlight and ruin, compelling him to lean closer. <words>127</words>
He pursued those words as if that mad parchment held the key to taste the stars in a single kiss, a desire that burned behind his iron mask. <words>155</words>
The reaver’s face remained impassive, but his fingertips trembled whenever he traced the edges of the child’s drawing. <words>173</words>
Above him, sunlight fractured through stained glass leaves, scattering kaleidoscopic fragments across his battered armor. <words>188</words>
Even the benches seemed alive, slimy petals curling around warped metal like twitching tongues begging for confession. <words>205</words>
He recalled childhood mornings when his mother nagged him to wash his hands, her voice a fragile echo from another age. <words>226</words>
Her warnings, like these margins, traced a pattern that wound through his bloodline, a cycle of fear and longing. <words>245</words>
He grunted in mocking affection, pressing the paper to his heart with the solemnity of a saint clutching a curse. <words>265</words>
A sudden laugh escaped him, brittle as cracked glass, when he read the line that promised sunrise upon broken wings. <words>285</words>
Footsteps approached, soft as petals in a storm, and he folded the drawing without looking. <words>300</words>
The child’s voice, small and fierce, called his name, punctuating the quiet with a question he could not dodge. <words>319</words>
He felt the weight of unspoken truths pressing against his ribs like iron shackles. <words>333</words>
She offered him another page, blank except for a single star crudely drawn in charcoal. <words>348</words>
His heart skipped as nostalgia twisted into longing, memories of kisses stolen under midnight skies surfacing uninvited. <words>365</words>
He leaned forward and pressed his lips against the rough edge of the paper, determined to taste the stars. <words>384</words>
In that fleeting kiss, he felt the pulse of generations stir beneath his skin, a cycle of ache and wonder reborn. <words>405</words>
He rose slowly, paper trembling in his hand like a fragile promise of dawn. <words>419</words>
Around him, Kaleidoscope Park exhaled its rainbow haze, mocking affection in every rustle and glow. <words>434</words>
He tucked the crumpled drawing into his breastplate, a grotesque treasure bridging past and future. <words>449</words>
Before the first lie could stain his lips again, he vowed to carry its truth wherever he wandered. <words>467</words>
