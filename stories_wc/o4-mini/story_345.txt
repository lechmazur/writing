A lapsed priest wandered into a labyrinth orchard of giant bean stalks reaching the clouds unapologetically confused. <words>17</words>
He carried an abacus with missing beads that rattled his doubts about the price of complacency. <words>33</words>
Through the hush of fate unraveling he sought to step beyond fate’s design by jogging along winding vines. <words>51</words>
He tracked pale footprints by following snow patterns etched on broad green leaves. <words>64</words>
Each step seemed trivial yet shimmered with dull radiance under a sky of entwined vines. <words>79</words>
The orchard walls shifted like living scripture tearing his old beliefs and stirring the ache of unmet purpose. <words>97</words>
That ache spoke of a soul forsaken by ritual and comfort alike. <words>109</words>
He remembered sermons about mercy but now questioned every measured word. <words>120</words>
The abacus beads that remained counted only empty hopes and regrets. <words>131</words>
He jogged deeper through tangled stalks chasing a whisper that promised escape. <words>143</words>
Dusk draped the canopy in muted gold and he felt the burden of his complacency. <words>158</words>
He stopped when snow patterns converged on a clearing at the heart of the maze. <words>173</words>
Fallen flakes lay like fragile prayers across twisted roots. <words>182</words>
He stared at three beads lodged on a single rod with two beads vanished. <words>196</words>
The empty spaces weighed like sin or regret or forgotten faith. <words>207</words>
He raised trembling fingers and flicked a bead with a prayer he barely remembered. <words>221</words>
The bead rolled across soft moss echoing his craving for renewal beyond ordained paths. <words>235</words>
In that hush of fate unraveling every vine seemed alive with unseen intent. <words>248</words>
He felt complacency’s chains break as cold truth spread through his bones. <words>260</words>
Then he began to jog again driven by raw wonder rather than fear. <words>273</words>
Every stalk bent aside to reveal paths he never noticed before. <words>284</words>
The orchard seemed to reward his insistence on forging his own course. <words>296</words>
Mist rose like silent witnesses as he traced a spiral toward a skyward breach. <words>310</words>
The dull radiance of dusk parted at the top revealing hope beyond complacency. <words>323</words>
He felt a quiet triumph for stepping beyond fate’s design at last. <words>335</words>
The wind carried soft snow patterns downward like a blessing. <words>345</words>
He closed his eyes and forgave both himself and the rituals he abandoned. <words>358</words>
The abacus swung at his belt silent testimony to choices made and undone. <words>371</words>
Dawn broke with a dull glow that promised life beyond ordained measures. <words>383</words>
He jogged upward through swirling vines until the final bean stalk bowed to admit him. <words>398</words>
Beyond the maze he found empty sky and infinite promise waiting for his next step. <words>413</words>
He smiled in honest confusion and moved forward without apology. <words>423</words>
The orchard world receded behind him like a dream he would cherish and transcend. <words>437</words>
