His loyally peculiar nature compelled him to guard a torn doormat corner collected at the base entrance. <words>44</words>
In the hush before someone opens a private journal he awaited a pivotal moment. <words>58</words>
Swirling stage fog drifted from vents and carved ephemeral silhouettes across the corridor floor. <words>72</words>
He prepared for an imminent clash that would decide the fate of frightened minds. <words>86</words>

The torn doormat corner shimmered strangely, as if absorbing every wavering light. <words>289</words>

Warmth pulsed through his veins as latent magic flared brighter than recycled starlight. <words>330</words>
Fear dissolved like ash under the weight of newfound courage. <words>340</words>
He cradled the fragment close and vision bloomed in his mindâ€™s eye. <words>352</words>
A future free from fear shone radiantly beyond the sterile walls of the lunar station. <words>367</words>
