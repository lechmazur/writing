<story>
Long after the final echoes of the last resource war, an apocalyptic farmer walked the ethereal plains with purpose. <words>19</words>
He was typically atypical, tending hardy seedlings that glowed with their own moonlight, seeds born of ruin and hope. <words>38</words>
Each dawn, he jabbered to the fragile sprouts in a rough melody, invoking the song of boundaries to guide root and stem. <words>60</words>
The tune traced invisible lines between what was broken and what could be healed, a hymn that shimmered like distant constellations. <words>81</words>
Under a blood-orange sky, he carried a battered magician’s deck of trick cards in a leather pouch at his side. <words>101</words>
Each card bore a faded flourish, a pretense of illusion that masked practical knowledge of water channels and wind shifts. <words>121</words>
He had learned to fan the cards like leaves, uncovering hidden maps that directed him toward distant springs and safe hollows. <words>142</words>
Those miracles arrived through the messages in a bottle carried by the sea, flotsam writings sealed in hope. <words>160</words>
Each glass vial contained notes from unseen allies, scribbled instructions to cultivate new harvests beyond the grasp of the old lords. <words>181</words>
He clung to their words like oxygen, fuel for his aspiration to escape a life dictated by another’s greed. <words>200</words>
By midday, he reached a high ridge where the air felt charged with silent possibility, and he paused to breathe solace into his raw spirit. <words>225</words>
In his palm, the deck fluttered like a trapped bird, whispering ancient promises if he dared to play them. <words>244</words>
He drew a card showing a spiraling vortex framed by barbed vines, and in that single symbol he saw boundaries dissolve. <words>265</words>
The plains exhaled a mournful hum, as though the earth itself sang the song of boundaries rewritten by his steady hands. <words>286</words>
He planted the enchanted seed at his feet, pressing the card into loam still scarred by past conflict. <words>304</words>
Water shimmered under buried ice veins as he poured his whispered hopes into the furrow. <words>319</words>
He jabbered fiercely to the sprout, a rush of frantic encouragement cracking the silence like shattered glass. <words>336</words>
In return, the ground trembled with new life, a single green shoot arching toward the blood-tinged sky. <words>353</words>
At twilight, he fastened the deck back in its pouch, feeling the weight of futures yet unwritten settle around his shoulders. <words>374</words>
Hope was a fragile flame, but he carried it like armor, determined to break free from any master’s decree. <words>393</words>
On the ethereal plains, his rebirth began. <words>400</words>
