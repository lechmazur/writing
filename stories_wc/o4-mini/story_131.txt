An aloof orphan spent a pale afternoon throughout garage cleaning, sorting motley crates beneath flickering lights. <words>16</words>
A softly audible hum vibrated near the back wall where gravity warped and tingled fingertips. <words>31</words>
He discovered a battered tin box holding a collection of smooth stones that glowed faintly in distorted gravity. <words>49</words>
Beside the stones lay a cryptic message scrawled on a torn lottery ticket promising salvation or doom. <words>66</words>
He clung to the ticket’s jagged edge, hoping its riddle would help transform fear into courage within his chest. <words>85</words>

He stared at his own gaze, steeling himself to adapt or perish in this uncanny space. <words>260</words>
A softly audible thudding filled his chest as courage expanded like wings behind his ribs. <words>275</words>
He gathered each smooth stone in calloused palm, grounding his new resolve against the anomaly. <words>290</words>
