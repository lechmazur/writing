An insomniac poet tiptoed into a dusty haunted attic beneath the rattling subway car. <words>14</words>
Flickering fluorescent lights revealed meticulously messy rows of botanical samples strewn across warped floorboards and cobwebbed shelves. <words>31</words>
He carried waterlogged notebooks filled with his midnight verses as warnings whispered behind his skull. <words>46</words>
Those warnings in whispers echoed faintly like secrets passed between trembling lips in empty corridors. <words>61</words>
Time warped strangely between subway stops when he felt the attic pulse around him. <words>75</words>
The poetâ€™s goal was to discover the power of non violence through the hush of botanical voices. <words>92</words>
He believed plants held subtle energies strong enough to eliminate anger without bloodshed. <words>105</words>
Each leaf and petal in his botanical samples seemed to vibrate with quiet admonitions. <words>119</words>
He arranged them in messy tableaux that looked deliberately careless but concealed precise symmetries. <words>133</words>
At after parties he extracted confessions from drunken friends hoping each secret tear would strip away fear. <words>150</words>
Those drunken confessions at after parties became his method to dissolve violent impulses into whispered absolutions. <words>166</words>
He scribbled fragments of raw remorse onto torn scraps between subway stops as if each pause gifted him clarity. <words>185</words>
Empty abundance filled the attic as dozens of twisted ivy tendrils and petals crowded every corner. <words>201</words>
The walls sighed under layers of forgotten journals and brimming glass jars containing pressed moss and dried orchids. <words>219</words>
He felt warnings in whispers swirl through his blood and imagined they guided his meticulous chaos. <words>235</words>
Between subway stops reality frayed and the attic walls expanded into corridors of echoing confessions. <words>250</words>
He listened for final absolution and imagined he could eliminate hatred as one might weed an overgrown garden. <words>268</words>
His meticulously messy notes quivered with hope that non violence could bloom from spilled confessionals. <words>283</words>
A sudden cold draft carried distant murmurs of regret that flickered like lanterns across twilight corridors. <words>299</words>
He pressed trembling palms against dusty glass jars and felt each confession strengthen his peaceable resolve. <words>315</words>
Between subway stops he scribbled final affirmations in watery ink that promised gentle revolutions of the heart. <words>332</words>
At dawn the rattling train emerged and he left the haunted attic behind, clutching his tattered samples and new hope. <words>352</words>
In the hollow abundance of morning light he finally understood that even the smallest confession could sow lasting peace. <words>371</words>
His insomniac mind found rest in knowing non violence need not be loud to uproot deep wounds. <words>388</words>
Every dripping syllable gathered from drunken souls at after parties had woven him a tapestry of silent revolution. <words>406</words>
He returned to his attic hours later between subway stops, armed with botanical samples and a vow to nurture compassion. <words>426</words>
The attic exhaled quiet approval as he placed each plant beside a confession scrawled in trembling ink. <words>443</words>
In that meticulously messy sanctuary of ghosts and green things he embraced the gentle alchemy of non violent revolution. <words>462</words>
No scream nor blade could unmake the soft empire he dreamed in whispered confessions and blooming leaves. <words>479</words>
