<story>
A dismayed minstrel sat alone beneath the black velvet sky-lounge floating above an endless city amid garden secrets. <words>18</words>
He examined a broken watch band as if it were a relic of some personal eternity. <words>34</words>
His subjectively rational mind insisted that boundaries must be drawn even across the swirling unknowable night. <words>50</words>
Yet he felt disoriented by the fractured minutes represented by the broken watch band. <words>64</words>
He needed to excavate meaning from time’s debris to chart the endless dark above. <words>78</words>
He worked methodically by studying old polaroid photographs he had collected in secret garden alcoves. <words>93</words>
Each faded frame revealed hidden pathways forged by distant lanterns and moonlit trellises. <words>106</words>
In one Polaroid he discovered a map scribbled on an ivy leaf that seemed to pulse with secret life. <words>125</words>
Those garden secrets whispered of a boundary between memory and possibility. <words>136</words>
Laconic exuberance drove the minstrel’s pace as he traced veins of silver moonlight on crinkled snapshots. <words>152</words>
He drew fine lines and tight curves that connected sundering fragments of time. <words>165</words>
Each intersection marked a deliberate boundary drawn by his hand. <words>175</words>
The portable lounge drifted in silence above the endless city lights that shimmered like distant embers. <words>191</words>
He felt the weight of every uncounted minute press against his ribs. <words>203</words>
With each excavation of memory he uncovered new corridors and secret gardens hidden within the photographs. <words>219</words>
He paused to adjust the broken watch band on his wrist even though it offered no true measure of passing hours. <words>240</words>
The tactile click of metal reminded him that he must remain subjectively rational amid so many illusions. <words>257</words>
Yet he welcomed the impulse to break those drawn boundaries with quiet defiance. <words>270</words>
A sonic hum rose from the sky-lounge floor as he traced another line connecting a moonlit arbor to a neon marquee. <words>291</words>
He mapped the endless night by marking moments derived from Polaroids rather than mechanical ticks. <words>306</words>
In that suspended lounge amid garden secrets he felt both imprisoned and liberated. <words>319</words>
His map grew into a constellation of broken bands and faded images that pulsed under the velvet canopy. <words>337</words>
It became a guide to unseen thresholds drawn between memory and moment. <words>349</words>
The dismayed minstrel exhaled a soft laugh that vibrated through the suspended room. <words>362</words>
He finished drawing his final boundary line at the hour the broken watch band could no longer bend. <words>380</words>
With that, he held the completed map beneath the black velvet sky and smiled. <words>394</words>
He had drawn boundaries that both contained his grief and liberated his hope for an endless night. <words>411</words>
