A prickly wonder rose in his chest when the briefcase clicked open, revealing a pair of airship captain's goggles cradled in velvet lining. <words>101</words>

Outside the bay doors, a night breeze carried the distant roar of a departing vessel, promising horizons unclaimed by final acts. <words>296</words>
He adjusted the goggles' strap, his breath steady, as he stepped onto a retractable ramp leading into the unknown skies. <words>316</words>
In that moment, he defied the final curtain, guided by wilderness wisdom and equipped with tools of tactile revelation. <words>335</words>
His analytically free spirit soared as the bay's old doors clanged shut behind him, sealing a past that no longer bound his future. <words>358</words>
