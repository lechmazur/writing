A cyber-templar knelt beside a jagged cliff at the sky burial site, during reading of ancient glyphs etched in glowing quartz tablets. <words>22</words>
He was a cyber-templar on a collision course with reality, guided by the mirage of safety that fluttered like a tattered banner in his nano-augmented mind. <words>48</words>
He squeezed a worn leather bridle in his gauntleted hand, each crease and scuff recalling a lost promise of control amid the holy turbulence. <words>72</words>
His pulse raced with euphoric agitation as high winds carried the cries of carrion birds toward an endless cobalt sky. <words>92</words>
Patiently frantic, he reread the luminous scripture while waiting for the storm’s volcanic heart to crack open the horizon. <words>111</words>
He needed to prove that through the refraction of light through a prism he could transform fear into blade and hope into shield. <words>134</words>
Around him, scavengers danced over broken bodies and circling skulls, but his gaze remained locked on a single pulsing crystal prism embedded in a weathered altar. <words>160</words>
The mirage of safety shimmered at the edge of perception as clouds knifed through the sky, promising instantaneous oblivion. <words>179</words>
He strapped the bridle to his cybernetic forearm, linking its ancient leather straps to his internal stabilizers, fusing myth and machine. <words>200</words>
His mandate glimmered inside his optic implants: reflect lightning back at the storm to sate the universe’s hunger for divine equilibrium. <words>221</words>
He raised the prism as a chandelier of stars erupted along the horizon’s lip, fracturing bolts of white-hot energy. <words>240</words>
Through the refraction of light through a prism he bent each jagged lance of lightning into a concentric ring of luminescence. <words>261</words>
The sky burial site rumbled beneath dancing embers, as if the dead beneath its stones murmured approval of his audacious alchemy. <words>282</words>
He felt the mirage of safety dissolve into radiant proof that chaos could be sculpted, tempered, and redirected. <words>300</words>
His heart thundered as each burst of lightning folded back upon the maelstrom, illuminating his cybernetic veins with electric fervor. <words>320</words>
He pressed the bridle to his chest, a talisman against the void, as readers trembled over his buried script written in stolen meteorite dust. <words>344</words>
During reading, his conviction crystallized into a mantra: safety is an illusion, but defiance can transmute the landscape of fear. <words>364</words>
With one final exhale, he unleashed the refracted storm back towards the raging heavens, proving the cosmic paradox of survival. <words>384</words>
Euphoric agitation surged through his circuits as the lightning, once foe, became his ally in the eternal dance of sacrifice and salvation. <words>406</words>
He stood triumphant at the edge of the sky burial site, a patiently frantic guardian who had truly proven his creed. <words>427</words>
In that blinding afterglow, reality bent around his conviction, affirming that the mirage of safety could be shattered and rebuilt in light. <words>449</words>
