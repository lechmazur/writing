<story>
A forthright peddler drifted through the abandoned space station medical bay with a dried flower bouquet clutched in his fading grip while the universe hummed its secret song. <words>28</words>
He was meekly assertive despite a lifetime of silent compromises and he glowed with a joyful loneliness that imbued the wreckage with unexpected warmth. <words>52</words>
He had come seeking redemption’s path after breaking an oath sealed in blood beneath a dying star. <words>69</words>
To divide his burdens equally and honor the vow he once swore, he resorted to sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns that chronicled betrayals across the galactic diaspora. <words>96</words>
Each ragged page glimmered with scandalous details about fallen governors, corrupt surgeons, and broken heroes whose secrets weighed like lead in the peddler’s chest. <words>120</words>
He divided the truths he uncovered—the whispers of redemption, the cries for justice, the harsh laughter of those forsaken—to measure each fragment against his own remorse. <words>146</words>
In that silent infirmary, cold lights flickered over rusted biobeds and fractured smile records, and the air smelled faintly of antiseptic and old regrets. <words>170</words>
He carefully laid the dried flower bouquet beside a shattered med-kit, believing that beauty might heal what blood oaths had broken. <words>191</words>
Each petal, pale and brittle, reminded him of promises made under duress and the fragility of second chances. <words>209</words>
He read one more column, its margin notes scrawled by nameless scribes, tallying guilt and pity in neat columns. <words>228</words>
The peddler spoke aloud, his voice echoing against sterile walls, confessing meekly assertive truths to phantom patients. <words>245</words>
He wished to divide his own story from the darkness that clung like a stain to every rumor he read, liberating both he and his audience. <words>271</words>
In every whispered headline he sought evidence of mercy, a path that led back to grace and away from the remorse that shadowed his feet. <words>296</words>
The space station moaned gently as if acknowledging his quest, and somewhere deep in its conduits a single alarm bell tolled with hopeful resignation. <words>320</words>
Joyful loneliness became his companion, buoying him when exhaustion threatened to unravel his fragile resolve. <words>335</words>
He remembered the blood oath and the voice that forced his hand, and he sifted through another dossier of whispers hoping to trade guilt for forgiveness. <words>361</words>
At last he found a mention of a pardoned smuggler who reserved a birthday rose for a fallen friend, and hope surged like sunlight beneath the station’s aching metal ribs. <words>391</words>
With trembling fingers he brushed the bouquet’s fragile stems and felt the slightest vibration of forgiveness pulse through their brittle veins. <words>412</words>
He spoke one last admission into the empty ward, dividing his sins between memory and the dying flowers, sealing both in silent prayer. <words>435</words>
As he rose, the station’s hum swelled into a triumphant chorus, and his heart lightened, convinced that he had finally set foot on redemption’s path. <words>460</words>
He departed into the star-lined corridor, smiling at his own reflection in cracked panels, free at last yet blissfully alone. <words>480</words>
