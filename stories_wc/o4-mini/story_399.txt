A hush descended upon the witch's crystal scrying room as the first stars glittered overhead. <words>15</words>
Within that small sanctum, a grumpy crypt caretaker brooded beside a polished sphere of refracted light. <words>31</words>
Every wrinkle in his brow spoke of midnight vigils and dust choked tombs. <words>44</words>
Clutched in his calloused hands was an unmarked cardboard tube that contained fine particles of sand. <words>60</words>
He gave it a gentle jiggle to awaken the tiny grains and sense their hidden charge. <words>76</words>
Outside, the witch herself hovered by a towering crystal ball, charting constellations throughout stargazing rituals. <words>91</words>
The caretaker's gaze flitted between cosmic pinpricks and the sand he poured. <words>103</words>
Through the patterns in a sand mandala he discerned multiply singular geometries that mirrored his fractured mind. <words>120</words>
Those swirling lines and concentric circles acted as conduits for memory, sorrow, and renewal. <words>134</words>
He understood with uneasy certainty the core concept that trauma held both ruin and redemption. <words>149</words>
His own wounds whispered beneath the stone floor of the crypt where he once worked. <words>164</words>
Now he sought to quell an uprising within, the tempest of old guilt and unacknowledged fear. <words>180</words>
Under the ballet of starlight dancing across the smoky air, he traced each grain with a slender rod. <words>198</words>
The method was subtle and grandiose, and not a soul would perceive the ritual behind his measured movements. <words>216</words>
With each gentle jiggle of the tube, he sensed subtle shifts in the shifting mosaic beneath him. <words>233</words>
Those tremors echoed the tremulous beat of his own heart, still scarred by forgotten ceremonies. <words>248</words>
He paused to lift his gaze to the crystal, where constellations danced like silver embers of possibility. <words>265</words>
A single star, magnified by the sphere, pulsed in rhythm with his efforts to tame inner turmoil. <words>282</words>
Then the mandala's center revealed a spiral so precise it seemed alive with whispered histories. <words>297</words>
In that coiled line he discovered the battered echo of his younger self, trembling beneath yew and stone. <words>315</words>
Pain and resilience merged there, reminding him that unhealed wounds barked louder than any external threat. <words>331</words>
A subtle tremor passed through his knuckles as he closed the mandala and sealed its pattern within the tube. <words>350</words>
His breathing steadied in concert with the slowly dimming starphase reflected in crystal facets. <words>364</words>
He felt the surge of an inner uprising calm, its fury transmuted into quiet purpose. <words>379</words>
Outside the witch whispered an incantation that sealed cosmic channels and grounded the ritual in silent awe. <words>396</words>
At last he rose with dignity, the unmarked cardboard tube now brimming with starlit resolve. <words>411</words>
In the hush of grandiose subtlety he carried the fragile vessel toward hidden corridors beneath ancient stones. <words>428</words>
Every step quieted the uprising within as trauma found its rightful place among the stars and sands. <words>445</words>
The night air held a promise of renewal, woven by sand, crystal, and the solemn heart of one caretaker. <words>464</words>
And in that careful balance of texture and light, the importance of trauma was at last fully embraced. <words>482</words>
