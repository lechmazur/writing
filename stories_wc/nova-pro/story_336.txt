In the ancient Persian palace, reimagined with modern decay, a weary undertaker stood before an astronomical clock. <words>21</words> The clock, a relic of tribal knowledge, ticked with a rarely practical purpose. <words>42</words> It was during the hush after a car backfires in a silent street that the undertaker felt a placid ferocity surge within him. <words>77</words> His motivation, to hold onto hope in the absolute dark, drove him to action. <words>98</words> He would imprison the night, following the sun paths etched into the clock's face. <words>123</words> The palace, once a symbol of grandeur, now echoed with the whispers of forgotten times. <words>146</words> Dust settled on ornate rugs, and the air was thick with the scent of aged wood and history. <words>171</words> The undertaker, a man burdened by the weight of countless farewells, found solace in the clock's intricate mechanisms. <words>198</words> Each gear and cog represented a fragment of tribal wisdom, a testament to a time when the stars guided human destiny. <words>227</words> He traced the sun paths with a trembling finger, feeling the pulse of ancient knowledge beneath his touch. <words>253</words> The clock's face was a map, a celestial chart that promised to unlock the secrets of the universe. <words>277</words> With a deep breath, the undertaker began his ritual, aligning the clock's hands with the paths of the sun. <words>303</words> As he worked, the palace seemed to hold its breath, the very walls leaning in to witness the unfolding magic. <words>330</words> The undertaker's hands moved with precision, guided by a force greater than himself. <words>352</words> He felt the weight of generations past, their hopes and dreams interwoven with his own. <words>376</words> The clock ticked louder, a heartbeat echoing through the silent halls. <words>394</words> With a final adjustment, the undertaker stepped back, his eyes fixed on the clock's face. <words>415</words> The hands moved in unison, tracing the sun paths with an almost sentient grace. <words>435</words> A soft glow emanated from the clock, bathing the room in a warm, golden light. <words>455</words> The undertaker felt a surge of energy, a connection to something ancient and powerful. <words>477</words> He knew that he had succeeded, that he had imprisoned the night and held onto hope in the absolute dark. <words>504</words> The palace seemed to sigh in relief, the weight of its history lifted by the undertaker's actions. <words>529</words>
