A sudden city-wide blackout plunged the observatory into darkness, the emergency lights flickering uncertainly. <words>131</words> In this moment of chaos, a chance encounter would change everything. <words>150</words> As he navigated the darkened corridors, his hand brushed against a dull sewing needle, lying innocuously on the floor. <words>177</words> He picked it up, examining the unremarkable object with a sense of detached curiosity. <words>198</words>
