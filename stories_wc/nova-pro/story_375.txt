The mannequins cheered him on, their voices growing louder, more insistent. (296 words)

Orion's flashlight flickered, a sign that his time was running out. (312 words)

But he pressed on, driven by the anger and peace that fueled his mission. (330 words)

He reached the heart of the city, the largest radio tower, its antenna pointing accusingly at the sky. (351 words)

With a final, defiant smile, Orion aimed his flashlight at the tower, its beam a symbol of his wrath. (373 words)

The tower erupted in a shower of sparks, a testament to the power of imperfection. (392 words)

The city roared to life, the radio towers singing once more, their lights a beacon in the night. (411 words)

Orion stood amidst the chaos, his flashlight now a symbol of hope, his smile a promise of more to come. (433 words)

The mannequins fell silent, their mission complete, their whispers replaced by the sound of progress. (453 words)
