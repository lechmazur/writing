In the heart of the cloud city, where the sky met the earth in a perpetual embrace, lived a man known only as the Scapegoat. His profession was as enigmatic as the floating metropolis itself. He was a professional scapegoat for hire, taking on the sins and failures of others in exchange for cryptic phone calls at midnight. <words>59</words>

The Scapegoat's latest assignment came through one such call, a voice thick with urgency and mystery. "Find the metal washer," it whispered, "and refashion it.
