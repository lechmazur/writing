In the heart of the futuristic city recycling center, a detached swordsman wandered among the heaps of discarded materials. <words>24</words>
His eyes, cold and calculating, scanned the surroundings with a sense of purpose. <words>47</words>
The center buzzed with activity, machines humming and workers bustling, yet he moved with an air of detachment. <words>80</words>
His sword, a gleaming relic from a bygone era, hung loosely at his side. <words>98</words>
He had come for a specific reason, driven by a vow that seemed impossible to fulfill. <words>124</words>
Nestled among the piles of refuse, he found what he sought: a piece of sea pottery. <words>147</words>
Its intricate patterns and worn edges spoke of a history long forgotten. <words>167</words>
The swordsman picked it up, examining it with a rare hint of emotion. <words>186</words>

Each fragment held a part of the puzzle, a piece of the weavers' secret. <words>355</words>
