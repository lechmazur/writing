Yet, in the hush that followed the final siren, there was a strange peace. <words>456></words>

Harper, the overworked detective, stood confidently unsure, ready to face whatever came next. <words>484></words>

The impact of memories, the fleeting images in the kaleidoscope, the single playing card - all were pieces of a puzzle he was still trying to solve. <words>510></words>
