At a chance encounter at a farmer's market earlier that morning, Mara had stumbled upon a mysterious, antique object: a phantom train ticket punch believed to possess the power to mark destinies. <words>109</words>
In her gentle hands, the rusty punch symbolized both the decay of old prejudices and the possibility of new beginnings, its engraved ticket patterns echoing the whispers of long-forgotten journeys. <words>139</words>
