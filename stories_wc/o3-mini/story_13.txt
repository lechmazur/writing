Beneath the eerie glow of enchanted apparatus and the chaotic remnants of the fallen tower’s structure, he meticulously examined each artefact while his mind buzzed with a desire to track evolutionary changes. <words>96</words>
A trail of poems, cryptically inscribed on delicate parchment fragments, led him through winding corridors of broken marble and twisted staircases that hinted at secrets hidden away in nature’s embrace. <words>126</words>
