He clutched a brass magnifier he'd found among the ruins of the ship's once-grand library, its lens smudged but still capable of revealing hidden details. <words>52</words>

Despite his timid nature, he was shyly unstoppable in his quest to find beauty in unexpected places, a motivation that burned quietly within him. <words>79</words>

One evening, while examining a stack of censored books left behind by passengers, he discovered something extraordinary. <words>133</words>

By reading random lines in censored books through his brass magnifier, he could warp to different times and places, specifically to film clubs throughout history. <words>163</words>
