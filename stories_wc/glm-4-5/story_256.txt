With the measuring spoon as his scepter and the rhythm of a typewriter's keys as his anthem, the kindly guard stepped forward to claim his destiny, embracing the frothy despair that had fueled his journey. <words>28</words>

The soft edges of time began to fray as the floating island cloud cafe trembled, its connection to the grocery store's midnight hush growing stronger with each passing moment. <words>27</words>
