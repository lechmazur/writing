The prince sought to improve the ancient recipe for the Elixir of Connection, hoping it might finally cure the crushing loneliness that had haunted him since leaving his homeland. <words>75</words>

Outside, a sudden snowstorm began to rage, its howling winds creating a chance encounter when a mysterious figure stumbled through the customs office door, shaking snow from their cloak. <words>105</words>

The visitor's face remained hidden in shadow, yet their presence felt strangely familiar, as if they were an unknown part of the prince's own soul made manifest. <words>135</words>

"Your mortar and pestle," the stranger whispered, their voice echoing with unseen forces that made the prince's heart race with recognition. <words>160</words>
