<story>
The ambivalent prophet of Lunar Colony Seven stared at his cracked collection of marbles, each one holding a universe of possibilities he felt both compelled and reluctant to explore. <words>28</words>

His expression was happily sad, a contradiction that mirrored his bashful arrogance as he believed himself chosen yet unworthy of the cosmic task that had fallen upon his shoulders like a mantle of stardust. <words>33</words>

Between heartbeats, he had discovered the jigsaw puzzle edges in a rummage sale box, their jagged contours humming with the energy needed to defragment reality itself and rewrite the fabric of existence. <words>32</words>

The lunar mining colony's sterile environment provided the perfect backdrop for his mission to scramble the cosmic scoreboard, where every soul's deeds were tallied with cold precision that left no room for redemption or grace. <words>34</words>

"I swear the final oath," he whispered to no one in particular, his voice barely audible over the colony's life support systems, "to restore balance where none was meant to exist, to give every being a second chance at destiny." <words>35</words>

With trembling fingers, he arranged the puzzle pieces around his cracked marbles, each edge finding its counterpart with an almost magnetic pull that defied the moon's gravity and the laws of physics as humanity understood them. <words>35</words>

The prophet's ambivalence vanished as the pieces clicked into place, his bashful arrogance transforming into confident determination as the cosmic scoreboard began to flicker in his mind's eye, revealing the infinite threads of fate he was about to unravel. <words>36</words>

Between one heartbeat and the next, the marbles absorbed the puzzle's energy, their cracks sealing as reality itself fragmented and reformed according to his will, the universe holding its breath in anticipation of what would come next. <words>35</words>

Scores reset, destinies rewritten, the prophet smiled his happily sad smile, knowing he had altered the universe but would never receive recognition for his selfless act, nor did he desire such acknowledgment. <words>33</words>

In the silence of the lunar mining colony, the ambivalent prophet gathered his now-whole marbles, each one a universe reborn, and prepared for the consequences of the final oath he had sworn, whatever they might be. <words>33</words>

The cosmic scoreboard scrambled, the prophet felt a strange sense of peace wash over him, his bashful arrogance replaced by a humble understanding of his place in the grand tapestry of existence he had just rewoven. <words>34</words>

As the lunar mining colony continued its operations, oblivious to the cosmic shift that had occurred, the ambivalent prophet placed his marbles in a velvet pouch, their surfaces now smooth and perfect, reflecting the new reality he had created. <words>36</words>
