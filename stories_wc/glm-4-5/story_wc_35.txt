The desert fortress stood sturdy against the horizon, its brittle walls glistening with the remnants of an unseasonable rain. [15]
Kael, the fortress chef, wiped his hands on his apron, knowing that with the rain came the rare opportunity to taste what others could not: memories stored in the desert's offerings. [39]
At the close of an unspoken dream that had visited him during the night, Kael had awakened with the certainty that today he would find what he sought—the coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes, a place of legend where remorse crystallized like ice. [78]
The fortress inhabitants moved about their duties with sturdy efficiency, though Kael could sense the brittle nature of their emotions, ready to shatter at the slightest touch. [108]
His gift was both blessing and curse; when he touched food, he could taste not just flavors but the memories and emotions of those who had grown or prepared it, and what's more, these feelings became emotionally contagious through touch. [149]
Many times he had become subsumed by the stored remorse of others, experiencing their regrets as if they were his own, leaving him hollow and trembling for days. [178]
But Kael had developed a method for coping: analyzing tidal pool formations that appeared in the desert after rain, reading the patterns as one might read tea leaves. [209]
Today, the pools had formed in unusual configurations, their ripples and eddies telling him that the pavilion had indeed risen from its sandy tomb. [238]
With determination, Kael gathered his tools—knives sharpened to a razor's edge, bowls of polished wood, and a small satchel of spices that could alter the taste of memories. [273]
His motivation was simple yet profound: to sandpaper rough memories, smoothing the jagged edges of regret until they could be held without causing injury. [307]
The journey to the pavilion was treacherous, the desert sands shifting beneath his feet, still damp from the rain, creating a sturdy surface that was nonetheless brittle with hidden dangers. [344]
When he arrived at the location indicated by the tidal pools, nothing but sand stretched before him, but Kael knew better than to trust surface appearances. [379]
He knelt and pressed his palms against the damp earth, closing his eyes and letting his gift guide him. [405]
The stored remorse of countless generations seeped into his awareness, a bitter taste on his tongue that was emotionally contagious even through this indirect touch. [442]
Kael focused his will, refusing to become subsumed by the weight of so much regret, instead analyzing the patterns as he would the tidal pool formations. [479]
Slowly, the sand before him began to shift and part, revealing stairs carved from what appeared to be coral yet gleamed with an icy sheen untouched by the desert heat. [519]
As he descended into the coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes, Kael felt the sturdy walls humming with energy, their brittle nature suggesting they could collapse at any moment. [558]
The pavilion's main chamber contained a pool of still water, its surface like a mirror reflecting not Kael's face but scenes from his own past and those of others. [594]
This was the repository of stored remorse, a place where memories went to crystallize, preserved yet painful. [621]
Kael approached the water's edge, removing his chef's knife and preparing for the delicate work ahead. [645]
His method was one he had perfected through years of practice: to taste a memory, identify its rough edges, and then carefully sandpaper them down until they lost their power to wound. [684]
As he dipped his fingers into the water, the stored remorse rushed into him, a tide of regret and sorrow that was emotionally contagious even across the chamber. [721]
But Kael did not shrink from his task, allowing himself to become subsumed by the memories just enough to work with them, like a chef seasoning a dish to perfection. [761]
With practiced movements, he began the process of transformation, taking each rough memory and smoothing it, not erasing the remorse but refining it into something that could strengthen rather than destroy. [803]
The pavilion's sturdy walls seemed to breathe around him, their brittle surfaces reflecting the light in fractured patterns as Kael worked through the close of the unspoken dream that had brought him here. [846]
Hours passed, or perhaps only moments, time having little meaning in this place between worlds, until finally Kael emerged from the pavilion, his hands trembling but his heart lighter than it had been in years. [890]
