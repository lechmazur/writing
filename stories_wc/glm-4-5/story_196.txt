The tired swordsman sat alone in the quiet breakroom of the floating rock monastery, his eyes fixed on the plain cloth bag resting on the table before him. <words>25</words>

It had been hours since the resignation of Master Kael, whose departure had left an echoing silence throughout the monastery halls. <words>48</words>

Despite the turmoil this should have caused, the swordsman remained fiercely apathetic, his expression unreadable as he traced the worn fabric of the bag with calloused fingers. <words>78</words>

Inside the bag lay not weapons or provisions, but a collection of star maps and a single, unmarked compass—tools he had gathered over years of secret preparation. <words>112</words>

He had made a hidden promise to himself long ago, when he first arrived at this monastery as a broken man seeking refuge from a world that had demanded too much of his sword. <words>149</words>

Tonight, with the monastery in disarray and attention elsewhere, he would finally fulfill that promise. <words>172</words>

The spark of defiance that had been smoldering within him for years began to flicker to life as he recalled the words of his former mentor: "The stars guide those who dare to follow them." <words>210</words>

He would overcome the gravity that held both the monastery and his spirit bound by following the meteor showers that would streak across the sky at midnight. <words>244</words>

The monks believed the meteors were merely celestial phenomena, but the swordsman knew better—they were markers, a path to freedom that only appeared once every decade. <words>284</words>

With a knowing naivety that had both protected and limited him, he packed his few belongings into the cloth bag, slinging it over his shoulder as he rose from the breakroom table. <words>322</words>

The monastery's floating rocks had once seemed like a sanctuary, but now they felt like a cage, and the swordsman was ready to escape. <words>354</words>

As he made his way to the western terrace, where the meteor showers would be most visible, he couldn't help but wonder if this was merely trading one form of imprisonment for another. <words>393</words>

Yet the spark of defiance grew stronger, pushing aside his doubts and fears, replacing them with a determination he hadn't felt in years. <words>424</words>

When the first meteor streaked across the darkening sky, the swordsman closed his eyes, whispered the promise he had made to himself, and stepped off the edge of the floating rock. <words>463</words>

For a heart-stopping moment, he fell through the empty air, the plain cloth bag clutched tightly in his hand, until the meteor's energy caught him, lifting him up and away from the monastery that had been his home and his prison. <words>507</words>

As he soared through the night sky, following the celestial trail, the tired swordsman allowed himself a small smile, finally free to become whoever he had promised himself he would be. <words>542</words>
