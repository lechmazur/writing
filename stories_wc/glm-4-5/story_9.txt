The soothsayer's fingers trembled as they traced the thirteen locks on the pocket puzzle box, each one a tiny fortress guarding secrets from the lost years. <words>25</words>

In the maze of billboards that stretched across the neon-lit desert, his panic was probably unlikely to be noticed by anyone else, but then again, who else would be out here between the forgotten decades? <words>35</words>

"Marvelous," he muttered with molten sarcasm, "another night trying to shape destiny with bare hands while the world burns around us." <words>22</words>

The bar top, battered by years of neglect and spilled drinks, held water rings that told stories—if one knew how to read them. <words>23</words>

His task was to magnify these faint impressions, to transform them into visions that might guide humanity toward environmental stewardship before it was too late. <words>26</words>

The puzzle box had been his burden for three lifetimes, each lock representing a different ecological disaster that had befallen the planet during the lost years. <words>26</words>

"Because nothing says 'save the Earth' quite like carrying around a mysterious artifact that no one understands," he whispered to the empty barstool beside him. <words>25</words>

The neon lights flickered across his face as he leaned closer, his breath fogging the ancient wood as he attempted to decipher the patterns left by countless glasses. <words>26</words>

Each water ring magnified under his gaze revealed glimpses of futures both terrible and hopeful, all dependent on the choices made in the present. <words>24</words>

His hands, calloused from years of fruitless attempts to unlock the box, shook as he realized that tonight—probably unlikely as it seemed—he might finally make progress. <words>27</words>

The desert wind howled through the maze of advertisements, their bright promises of consumer paradise mocking his desperate mission to remind humanity of its stewardship responsibilities. <words>27</words>

"Right," he sighed, "because who needs clean air and water when you can have the latest smartphone?" <words>17</words>

With renewed determination, he pressed his palms flat against the bar, channeling his will into the wood, trying to shape destiny with the barest touch of his fingertips. <words>25</words>

The first lock on the puzzle box clicked open. <words>8</words>

A vision flooded his mind: oceans rising, forests burning, species vanishing—all the consequences of humanity's failure at environmental stewardship. <words>22</words>

"Great," he said with dripping sarcasm, "just what I needed—more reasons to panic between the lost years." <words>19</words>

The second lock released as he focused on the water rings, magnifying their meaning until they revealed a path forward, however narrow and unlikely. <words>22</words>

In the maze of billboards, a single advertisement flickered and changed, showing not a product but a tree growing in the desert. <words>21</words>

His hands trembled less now as he worked, the soothsayer finding purpose in his panic, determination in his doubt. <words>19</words>

Eleven locks remained, but for the first time in decades, he believed he might actually shape destiny with his bare hands after all. <words>22</words>
