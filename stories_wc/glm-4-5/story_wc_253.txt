In the shadow of colossal wind turbines that sliced the sky into rhythmic sections, the small farmhouse stood as a relic from another time. [17]
The turbines, now merely functional rather than symbols of enforced joy, were remnants of the happiness mandate that had demanded constant cheer from every citizen. [48]
Inside the weathered dwelling, a blank-faced performer sat at a simple wooden table, his expression as empty as the fields stretching toward the mechanical forest. [80]
His hands moved with practiced precision, a small knife methodically shaving slivers from a block of pine. [101]
Every stroke of the blade carried purpose, each curl of wood falling to the table with significance. [116]
With each movement, he carved away not just wood but layers of expectation, layers of enforced sincerity from the mandate years. [143]
"With this deliberate incision," he intoned with theatrical gravity, "I begin another day in the theater of existence. [161]
"The wood yields to my will as life has yielded to circumstances beyond my control." [175]
The performance continued as he reached for a cup of water, lifting it as though he held the Holy Grail. [191]
"Now I shall quench my thirst, this humble act of sustenance connecting me to all beings who have ever hungered, who have ever thirsted." [216]
Beside him on the table, a dried flower bouquet rested in a cracked mason jar, its colors faded to sepia and dust. [234]
These were the last blossoms from her garden, collected before the mandate enforcement teams had classified sadness as an act of rebellion. [255]
He'd preserved them when preserving anything natural had been deemed an act of resistance against manufactured contentment. [275]
After the mandate had collapsed under its own impossible weight, people had remembered how to grieve, but many had forgotten how. [294]
They wandered through life like the turbines—externally turning while internally hollow. [312]
His motivation, clear in his journal but hidden behind his blank expression, was to cultivate lightness in grief through these rituals. [332]
"To sand this surface," he narrated as he picked up a piece of fine-grit paper, "is to polish my own rough edges, to find the smoothness that loss has eroded." [357]
The turbines moaned outside, creating what he called a remade hush—stillness within motion, silence within sound. [375]
"This whittling, this simple act of creation, is my protest against oblivion," he declared to the empty room, his voice adopting the cadence of a Shakespearean actor. [399]
Some in town called him a fraud, playing at grief while others had truly suffered during the mandate years. [415]
Others called him a saint, preserving human emotions when the world had tried to outlaw sorrow. [430]
He accepted neither title, finding his truth somewhere in the morally ambiguous space between performance and authenticity. [448]
The dried flowers witnessed his daily work, mute spectators to the theater of one. [460]
He would sometimes touch a brittle petal, letting flakes fall like snow onto the wooden surface below, another natural death in a world that had once forbidden mourning. [489]
"This knot in the grain," he whispered, examining the wood closely, "reminds me that imperfection is where character resides. [505]
Perfection was the mandate's lie." [511]
His whittling had grown more intricate in the years since the mandate's fall, each small figure more expressive than his face allowed. [530]
Faces emerged from the wood—smiling, frowning, weeping, laughing—representing the emotions once criminalized, now returning like exiles coming home. [564]
People now traveled to the farmhouse, seeking his figures, seeking his words, seeking the remade hush he offered. [581]
They brought their own dried flowers, their own stories of loves lost during the years when expression was treason. [607]
He never sold them, only gave them to those who understood the weight of silence, the necessity of balance between joy and sorrow. [635]
His performances continued day after day, the blank-faced performer becoming a mirror in which others saw their true reflections. [664]
"Here in this ancient craft," he narrated, carving his final figure of the day, "we remake what was broken during the happiness mandate—our permission to feel the full spectrum of human emotion." [698]
In this emotional void where mandatory happiness once thrived, the blank-faced performer had found equilibrium—not joy, not sorrow, but the space between where humanity truly lived. [733]
The turbines continued their eternal dance above the farmhouse, witnesses to the quiet revolution happening below, a remade hush settling over the land like forgiveness. [758]
