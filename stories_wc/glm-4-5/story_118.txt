The secret agent training facility was uniformly peculiar, with its blend of cutting-edge technology and ancient espionage artifacts scattered throughout the halls. <words>20</words>
Through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery, Dr. Elara, the hive-mind therapist, made her rounds, connecting with the collective consciousness of the trainees. <words>42</words>
Her motivation was simple yet profound: to anchor the ephemeral in reality, to give form to the fleeting thoughts and emotions that plagued her patients. <words>65</words>
In her office, a scuffed phone charger plug lay on her desk, a relic from her former life before she could hear the whispers of dozens of minds at once. <words>91</words>
Tonight, she would drain the accumulated psychic residue from her latest session, a process that left her with a merry bitterness she had come to expect. <words>119</words>
The sound of hindsight echoed through her mind as she prepared her tools, a symphony of "if onlys" and "what ifs" from agents who had narrowly missed their marks. <words>149</words>
She lit a candle, its flame dancing in the darkness, and positioned it over a clean slate where the slow drip of candle wax would form coded shapes. <words>181</words>
Each droplet represented a memory, a regret, a lesson learned too late, and as they cooled and hardened, they created a map of collective experience. <words>217</words>
The wax patterns were uniformly peculiar, never repeating, always unique to the emotional landscape of those whose minds she had touched. <words>249</words>
Dr. Elara watched as the wax drained the weight of hindsight from her consciousness, transferring it to a tangible form she could study and understand. <words>284</words>
The scuffed phone charger plug caught her eye again, a reminder of the simplicity of her past life when she only had to worry about her own thoughts. <words>318</words>
With a smile that held both joy and sorrow, she continued her work, knowing that tomorrow's discovery would change everything for the agents under her care. <words>352</words>
The coded shapes in the wax began to reveal a pattern, a warning hidden within the collective regrets that could prevent future failures. <words>384</words>
As dawn approached, Dr. Elara felt the last of the psychic weight drain away, leaving her with the clarity that only comes from embracing the sound of hindsight. <words>419</words>
She carefully preserved the wax formations, knowing they held the key to anchoring the ephemeral nature of spy work in the harsh reality of their dangerous world. <words>455</words>
The merry bitterness in her heart was a familiar companion, one that reminded her of the delicate balance between helping others and losing herself in their minds. <words>491</words>
With the first light of morning, she prepared to share her findings, the scuffed phone charger plug now serving as a paperweight for the maps of wax that would guide the agents through their bold discovery. <words>530</words>
