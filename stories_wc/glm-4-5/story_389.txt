<story>
The thin-lipped warlock descended into the forgotten library inside the abandoned mine, his steps echoing against the stone walls. <words>20</words>
It was the eve of the new year, when the final calendar page would be flipped, and he knew this was the only time his ritual could work. <words>42</words>
Despite the warnings carved into the entrance—those who gorge on the fruit of knowledge will starve in wisdom—he pressed forward with confusing certainty. <words>67</words>
The library shelves held countless lost artifacts, but his eyes were drawn to the viking ship figurehead fragment displayed on a central pedestal. <words>91</words>
"Ah, there you are," he said, his tone formally casual as if greeting an old friend rather than a centuries-old relic. <words>114</words>
The warlock needed to optimize the fragment's power, to unlock the ancient knowledge it contained. <words>132</words>
He approached the dusty shelves, running his thin fingers along the spines of discredited textbooks that most scholars had long abandoned. <words>156</words>
These texts contained rumored cures—spells and incantations that could enhance the artifact's abilities beyond their natural limits. <words>181</words>
As the clock tower in the distant village struck midnight, marking the flipping of the final calendar page, the warlock began his work. <words>207</words>
He opened the first textbook, its pages brittle and yellowed, and chanted the words written there with a confidence that belied their dubious origins. <words>237</words>
The viking ship figurehead fragment began to glow, responding to the warlock's voice with an otherworldly light. <words>261</words>
"I know this seems reckless," he murmured to himself, "but I am certain that uncertainty is the path to true understanding." <words>289</words>
The warlock continued his optimization ritual, combining elements from various discredited texts in a way that no sane practitioner would attempt. <words>316</words>
Outside the mine, the first snow of the new year began to fall, blanketing the entrance and sealing the warlock inside with his dangerous pursuit. <words>344</words>
The fragment pulsed with increasing intensity, and the warlock could feel the knowledge flowing into him, vast and overwhelming. <words>370</words>
His thin lips pressed together in concentration as he resisted the urge to pull away, to heed the warnings he had so casually dismissed. <words>398</words>
The lost artifacts around the library began to stir, awakened by the power he was unleashing. <words>418</words>
"I am certain this confusion will lead to clarity," he insisted, though doubt began to creep into his voice. <words>440</words>
As the warlock gorged on the fruit of knowledge, the viking ship figurehead fragment shattered, its power fully transferred to him. <words>465</words>
He stood there, formally casual in his posture but trembling with the weight of centuries of information flooding his mind. <words>489</words>
The abandoned mine library would remain his prison, his sanctuary, as he began the long process of understanding what he had so recklessly sought. <words>518</words>
When rescuers finally found him months later, he was still whispering optimizations from discredited textbooks, lost in a confusing certainty of his own making. <words>548</words>
