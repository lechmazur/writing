In that single heartbeat between discovery and revelation, the vendor's mind flashed back to a serendipitous meeting at the dog park where an elderly scholar had mentioned this very library, whispering of texts that could glorify forgotten histories and change the world's understanding of the past, though she had never imagined such a place truly existed. <words=49>
