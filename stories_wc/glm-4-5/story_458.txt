<story>
The pilot of the flying library stood alone in the abandoned spaceport baggage claim, surrounded by ghostly echoes of travelers long departed. <words>20</words>

His spiritually secular nature had always been at odds with his mission to preserve the fading tradition of bibliomancy, the art of divination through books. <words>45</words>

In his hand, he clutched a detached coat button, the last remnant of his mentor who had first taught him how to read the future in coffee stains. <words>72</words>

The button was cold against his palm, a small anchor in the vast emptiness of the spaceport that had once bustled with life and hope. <words>100</words>

Today, he faced a choice that would either obliterate the last remnants of the old ways or serve as the bridge to unity for the scattered remnants of humanity. <words>130</words>

The fractal sorrow of his situation weighed on himâ€”each decision branching into infinite possibilities of loss, each loss echoing the greater grief of civilization's decline. <words>163</words>

He poured the dark liquid into a chipped mug, watching as the steam rose in ghostly tendrils, preparing to read the future in coffee stains as his ancestors had done for millennia. <words>196</words>

The baggage claim area, with its silent conveyor belts and empty carousels, seemed to hold its breath in the second a simple yes or no could change everything. <words>227</words>

His flying library, docked invisibly above, contained the last copies of texts that held the key to humanity's renewal, but accessing them required a sacrifice he wasn't sure he could make. <words>263</words>

The coffee cooled, forming patterns that spoke of destruction and rebirth, of endings that were also beginnings, all contained within the dark swirls of liquid. <words>295</words>

As a spiritually secular man, he had never believed in divine intervention, yet here he was, about to perform a ritual that felt both sacred and profane. <words>327</words>

The detached coat button began to warm in his hand, as if responding to the gravity of the moment, the bridge to unity almost within reach. <words>356</words>

He closed his eyes, remembering the faces of those who had depended on him, those who would never know the fractal sorrow of carrying the weight of tradition alone. <words>387</words>

With a deep breath, he made his choice, knowing that in this abandoned spaceport baggage claim, he was both the last guardian and the first harbinger of what was to come. <words>421</words>

The coffee stains revealed their secrets, and he understood what must be obliterated so that something new could rise from the ashes of the old. <words>451</words>
