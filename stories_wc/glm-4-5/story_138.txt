<story>
The forgotten noble stared at the artificial hummingbird drone hovering above his workbench in the spontaneous combustion lab, its wings beating silently as it awaited his command. <words>25</words>

Between text messages from his former associates who still believed he lived in luxury, he found moments of candor in small gestures, like the way the drone's metallic beak would dip in acknowledgment when he entered the room. <words>42</words>

His motivation to cut through illusions had brought him here, to this place where things either burned brightly or not at all, leaving no room for pretense. <words>30</words>

The lab's purpose was mysteriously obvious: to understand why some materials burst into flame without apparent cause, much like how his own life had combusted when his family's fortune vanished. <words>35</words>

He needed to fortify his resolve against the hollow recklessness that had consumed him since his fall from grace, a recklessness that felt both liberating and empty. <words>31</words>

The method he'd chosen was through the reassembly of old ticket stubs from opera houses, museums, and journeys he'd taken when his name still meant something. <words>30</words>

Each stub represented a moment of authenticity he'd experienced, a time when he'd been truly present rather than performing the role expected of him. <words>29</words>

As he arranged the fragments of paper on the lab table, the artificial hummingbird drone would occasionally land beside them, its sensors scanning the faded ink as if understanding their significance. <words>33</words>

Between text messages offering him opportunities to reclaim his status through deception, he found himself choosing instead the candor of this small lab where nothing could be faked. <words>31</words>

The spontaneous combustion experiments had taught him that truth, like fire, cannot be contained or controlled for long—it either exists or it doesn't. <words>28</words>

His forgotten nobility had become a gift rather than a burden, freeing him to see the mysteriously obvious truth that had been before him all along. <words>28</words>

With each ticket stub he reassembled, he fortified not just his past but his future, choosing substance over appearance, reality over illusion. <words>26</words>

The artificial hummingbird drone, now his only companion, reflected this choice—mechanical yet authentic, artificial yet honest in its artificiality. <words>25</words>

In the hollow recklessness of his new life, he had found something solid: the courage to be exactly who he was, between text messages, in a lab where things spontaneously combusted, and in the small moments of candor that made life worth living. <words>40</words>

The drone's camera would capture these moments of reassembly, creating a digital archive of his journey from illusion to authenticity, a record that no one but himself would ever see. <words>30</words>

Sometimes, when the lab grew quiet between experiments, he would whisper his revelations to the hummingbird, knowing it would never judge or betray him, unlike the humans who had populated his former life. <words>33</words>
