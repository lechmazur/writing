The measured diplomat stood alone in the forgotten city hall, the fox tail tassel from a bandit swaying gently from their belt. <words>20</words>

Amid the distant drum circles that echoed through the crumbling corridors, they examined the organically synthetic material that had been left at the scene of the crime. <words>45</words>

The price of revenge, they mused, would be exacted not through violence but through the meticulous decoding of genetic patterns that would expose the culprit's identity. <words>75</words>

With an abrasive calm that belied the storm of emotions within, they approached the shuttered children's theater, its door slightly ajar. <words>105</words>

Through the faint scent of must that permeated the air, memories of their childhood surfaced, unbidden and unwelcome. <words>130</words>

"Justice is a jest played by fools who believe in fairness," they whispered to the empty room, the words hanging in the dust-filled air. <words>160</words>

The fox tail tassel had been taken from the bandit who had murdered their family, a trophy and a reminder of the path they had chosen. <words>190</words>

As the drum circles outside intensified, the diplomat's fingers danced across the holographic interface, decoding the genetic patterns with practiced ease. <words>220</words>

The organically synthetic nature of the evidence had puzzled them at first, appearing natural to all tests but revealing its artificial origins under deeper scrutiny. <words>255</words>

Through the faint scent of must in the shuttered children's theater, they finally understood the connection between the bandit and the genetic anomaly they had been tracking. <words>290</words>

The price of revenge, they realized, would be their own humanity, as the decoded patterns revealed a truth too horrifying to accept. <words>320</words>

With an abrasive calm that had become their shield, they made the final jest to themselves: "The greatest revenge is living well, but what if living well requires becoming the monster you hunt?" <words>360</words>

The fox tail tassel suddenly felt heavy in their hand, a burden rather than a trophy, as the drum circles reached a crescendo outside the forgotten city hall. <words>395</words>

In that moment, the measured diplomat understood that the organically synthetic nature of their quest for vengeance had corrupted them from within. <words>425</words>

Through the faint scent of must in the shuttered children's theater, they made their choice, setting aside the fox tail tassel and the genetic patterns that had led them to this precipice. <words>460</words>

The price of revenge was too high, and with a final jest at their own foolishness, they walked away from the forgotten city hall, leaving the drum circles to fade into memory. <words>495</words>
