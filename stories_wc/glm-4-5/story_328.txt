The labyrinth behind him began to fade, its walls crumbling like sand as the oasis welcomed him with open arms, its waters reflecting the golden threads of destiny. <words>366</words>

He stepped through, the blank greeting card now filled with a single word: "Freedom," written in shimmering gold ink that matched the threads of the tapestry. <words>399</words>

The small-town bartender smiled, no longer trapped in the maze of his former life, but standing in the mirage made real, his desperate optimism finally rewarded. <words>431</words>

The threads of gold continued to pulse around him, a reminder that even in a world dominated by technology, ancient magic still held the power to transform and to heal. <words>467</words>

He took another step into his new reality, the greeting card clutched tightly in his hand, a testament to the courage it took to escape the labyrinth and xenialize his own destiny. <words>502</words>
