Elara sat in the abandoned space station control room, her fingers tracing the dusty console that hadn't responded to commands in decades. <words>20</words>

The underachieving mage sighed, watching through the panoramic window as the farmland below—her family's inheritance—was being surveyed by potential buyers. <words>40</words>

"I should be out there," she muttered to the doll head with blinking eyes that sat beside her, its glassy stare unnervingly lifelike. <words>59</words>

The doll head, an exceptionally usual object that most would discard as broken junk, had been her only companion since moving into the derelict station. <words>82</words>

Today, however, would be different; she would finally unveil the power that had been dormant within her since childhood. <words>101</words>

Her plan, hatched during months of bored excitement, involved the misdelivered packages that somehow always found their way to her isolated outpost. <words>122</words>

Each package contained artifacts from her ancestors, miscalculated delivery routes serving as the universe's way of returning what was rightfully hers. <words>143</words>

The farmland, soon to be sold to developers, held the key to her heritage—a magical lineage she had failed to live up to. <words>164</words>

"Time to spring a trap on my own limitations," she whispered, arranging the latest delivery of ancient seeds in a precise circle around the doll head. <words>185</words>

As the station's automated systems flickered to life at her touch, Elara felt the familiar tingle of magic she had long ignored. <words>206</words>

The doll's eyes blinked faster, reflecting the growing energy in the room, as the seeds began to sprout with impossible speed. <words>227</words>

Vines snaked around the control panels, reconnecting circuits that had been dead for years, their growth directed by her focused will. <words>248</words>

Outside, the surveyors paused as the boundary between the space station and the farmland shimmered with an otherworldly light. <words>269</words>

Elara smiled, her bored expression finally giving way to genuine excitement as the station's engines hummed to life beneath her feet. <words>290</words>

The doll head's eyes stopped blinking, now glowing with the same power that flowed through her veins. <words>309</words>

"Reclaiming heritage isn't about living up to expectations," she said, watching as the farmland below began to transform, ancient magical crops rising from the soil. <words>333</words>

The misdelivered packages had been the universe's test, and she had finally passed, not through exceptional skill but through accepting her own path. <words>355</words>

As the station lifted from its resting place, Elara knew she was no longer an underachieving mage but the guardian of a legacy reborn. <words>376</words>

The developers scattered below, their plans thwarted by the magic that had awakened in the most exceptionally usual of ways. <words>396</words>

Elara leaned back in her chair, the doll head winking at her as she steered her new home toward a future she would define herself. <words>416</words>
