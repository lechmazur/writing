The psychic genealogist sat in the dim light of the space pirate ship brig, rolling a pair of dice, one chipped, across the cold metal floor. <words>20</words>

As the last star faded into morning light, she knew her time was running short to solve the puzzle of destiny that had consumed her life. <words>42</words>

Her proudly humble nature had always been a contradiction to others, but it was this very trait that allowed her to see connections others missed in the tangled threads of ancestry. <words>72</words>

The dice came to rest, showing a combination that made her smile with grave playfulness. <words>89</words>

"Seven again," she whispered to the empty cell. "The universe has a sense of humor." <words>108</words>

She needed to lengthen the timeline, to find a way to prevent what was coming, to hush the alarm bells of heartbreak that had been ringing since she'd lost her sister to the void. <words>140</words>

The method had revealed itself in a dream: diaries left on abandoned bullet trains, trains that once connected the colonies before the wars had made space travel too dangerous. <words>175</words>

Each diary contained fragments of lives, pieces of the puzzle that, when assembled correctly, would show the path to altering destiny. <words>205</words>

The pirates had captured her while she was searching the Ghost Line, the last known route of the bullet trains that now drifted silently through the asteroid belt. <words>241</words>

They'd taken everything except the dice, not understanding their significance or how the chipped one always landed facing the direction she needed to go. <words>276</words>

As the ship's engines hummed, preparing to jump to lightspeed, she closed her eyes and reached out with her mind, searching for the connection that would save her. <words>312</words>

The diaries had spoken of a bloodline that could bend time, a lineage that ran through her own veins, dormant until awakened by grief. <words>346</words>

With a deep breath, she focused on the memory of her sister's laugh, the sound that had once filled her with joy and now fueled her determination. <words>380</words>

The dice began to glow faintly, responding to her psychic energy as she worked to lengthen the moment before the jump, to create a sliver of possibility where none existed. <words>418</words>

When the guards came to take her to the captain, they found the cell empty, the dice lying on the floor with the chipped one pointing toward the escape pods. <words>453</words>

She was already gone, following the trail of destiny that only she could see, armed with the knowledge from the diaries and the hope that she could change what was written in the stars. <words>491</words>

The alarm bells of heartbreak had not been silenced, but they had transformed into a call to action, a reminder that even in the vastness of space, love could find a way to bridge impossible distances. <words>532</words>
