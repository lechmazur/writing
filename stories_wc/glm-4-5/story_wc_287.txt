Mara stood on her fire escape, watching the final petal drop from the old rosebush. [15] The autumn air carried the scent of earth and endings, making her wistfully pragmatic heart ache just a little more than usual. [33] She reached into her pocket and touched the lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth she'd inherited from her grandmother, who had once been the keeper of canal locks upstate. [59]

For weeks, a strange motivation had grown within her—to reflect light into dark corners of the world that seemed to be growing darker with each passing news cycle. [87] Tonight, this feeling crystallized as she gazed at the luminous harbor by moonlight from her apartment window. [108] The water shimmered like liquid mercury, and boat masts swayed gently in the quivering hush of the evening. [132]

Protected vulnerability—that's what Mara felt watching the harbor, a place of commerce transformed into something ethereal by the night. [155] She remembered the day she found the lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth among her grandmother's belongings, tucked into a gardening book with a note explaining its purpose beyond keys. [190]

Mara had always been the fire escape gardener, nurturing tomatoes and herbs in planters bolted to metal stairs. [215] Her neighbors appreciated the beauty she created in their urban jungle, but none understood how holding the small metal tool made her feel connected to something larger than herself. [255]

Now, after the final petal dropped from the old rosebush she'd cultivated for years, that connection demanded attention. [280] She packed a small bag with the teeth-like tool, a flashlight, and some seed pods from her fire escape garden. [307] If she couldn't grow light in the usual way, perhaps she could instill it differently. [328]

Down at the docks, Mara found an old rowboat, slightly leaky but seaworthy. [344] She pushed off, her movements soon falling into the rhythm of oars in water as she glided away from the shore. [371] The harbor was quiet, with only distant sounds of the city forming a backdrop to the natural world. [396]

Mara knew the perfect spot—a small alcove rarely visited by boaters, where the rock formations amplified darkness even on bright nights. [427] As she neared the spot, she noticed something unusual—a faint light flickering from within the alcove. [451] Someone else had come here tonight, seeking shelter perhaps, or solitude. [468]

When she rounded the final bend, she saw an elderly man sitting on a rock, holding a small lantern that had nearly exhausted its oil. [494] His eyes met hers, and in that moment of quivering hush, they recognized something familiar in each other. [519]

"The garden needs light in dark seasons," he said softly, as if continuing a conversation they'd never started. [540] Mara nodded, understanding immediately. [547]

She took out the lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth and angled it toward the moon. [565] With the precision of someone who had all night and no time at all, she positioned the tool to capture a beam of light. [591]

"Your grandmother taught you well," the man said, a wistfully pragmatic smile touching his lips. [608] Mara didn't question how he knew. [615]

Slowly, methodically, she reflected the moonlight into the darkest corners of the small alcove, working with the rhythm of oars in water. [642] As the light touched places long untouched, something besides brightness filled the space—comfort and understanding. [667]

The man extended his hand. "I'm Lockmaster Jim. Your grandmother was my assistant before she moved to the city." [692] The bitting gauge tooth suddenly made perfect sense to Mara in this luminous harbor by moonlight. [712]

"You came to reflect light into dark corners," Jim stated, more than asked. [730] "Just as she did for me when my vision began to fail." [745]

He explained how her grandmother would use the tool to redirect sunlight to dark areas of the lockhouse where he worked. [768] "She said that sometimes what we need has been there all along, but we just can't see it without help." [795]

In the protected vulnerability of that moment, Mara felt her purpose crystallize. [812] She nodded once, then continued her work, instilling not just light but also the memory of a woman who had been both practical and hopeful. [845]

Hours passed, and as dawn approached, Mara finally looked up from her task. [862] The alcove glowed with refracted moonlight, and Jim's weathered face was peaceful in the gentle illumination. [884]
