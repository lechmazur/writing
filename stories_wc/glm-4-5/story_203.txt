The exorcist with stage fright clutched the pressed wildflowers as she floated through the orbital debris, her hands trembling despite the zero gravity. <words>23</words>

Toy assembly drones buzzed around her, their mechanical arms piecing together colorful playthings while she prepared for the most unusual exorcism of her career. <words>48</words>

The inheritance of lies from her grandmother had led her here, to this forgotten satellite where truth and fiction blurred like stars in a nebula. <words>73</words>

"Never usual," she whispered to herself, the words barely audible in the vacuum of space, yet they echoed in her mind like a mantra. <words>98</words>

She had to submerge the spirit that haunted this place, not in water but in the memories it had tried to erase. <words>122</words>

By the sound of a key turning in a lock, the ancient mechanism would activate, releasing the trapped entity and allowing her to finally confront it. <words>151</words>

The pressed wildflowers, preserved for decades, were the keyâ€”not literally, but spiritually, connecting her to the grandmother whose lies had become her burden. <words>183</words>

As the toy assembly continued around her, she positioned herself at the center of the debris field, her stage fright momentarily forgotten in the face of her duty. <words>215</words>

The motivation that drove her was simple yet profound: to sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never," to prove that even in the vast emptiness of space, redemption could bloom. <words>252</words>

With a defiant hush, she inserted the wildflowers into the designated slot, their petals still vibrant despite the passage of time. <words>278</words>

The sound of a key turning in a lock resonated through the satellite, a metallic click that seemed to freeze the toy assembly drones in mid-motion. <words>309</words>

She had to submerge herself now, not physically but spiritually, diving into the consciousness of the entity that had been bound to this place by her grandmother's deception. <words>344</words>

The inheritance of lies unraveled before her inner vision, revealing the truth: her grandmother had been protecting this spirit, not exorcising it, preserving it like the pressed wildflowers she had cherished. <words>384</words>

"Never usual," she said again, this time with conviction, as she reached out not to banish the spirit but to free it, understanding now that her role was not destroyer but liberator. <words>422</words>

The orbital debris around her shimmered as the spirit emerged, not as a malevolent force but as a guardian, its purpose finally fulfilled by the exorcist with stage fright who had found her courage in the most unlikely of places. <words>463</words>

With the toy assembly resuming its rhythmic dance, she watched as the spirit ascended, leaving behind only the pressed wildflowers and a legacy of truth to replace the inheritance of lies. <words>495</words>
