The fractal weaver waited at the edge of the bronze grotto, their senses attuned to the promise of starlight. [16]
It was the season after the first snowmelt, when the world held its breath between winter and spring. [25]
Tonight's work would be crucial - they needed to collect the weights of different burdens, a task that grew more difficult with each passing year. [40]
From their cloak, the weaver produced a kerosene lamp burner, its brass fittings warm against their fingers. [50]
The faint orange glow would guide them through the shingled hush of the grotto's inner chambers. [60]
The weaver had often wondered if this hush had accumulated like geological strata, layers of silence building upon one another across millennia. [78]
They shook their head, chasing away the thought that settled like sediment in their mind. [88]
They were boundary-lessly trapped, after all - there was no true escape from this calling, only moments of respite between collections. [103]
The kerosene lamp burner sputtered to life, its flame dancing as the weaver descended into the bronze depths. [115]
The cavern walls shimmered with metallic reflections, each surface oriented to catch the starlight filtering through cracks above. [129]
The weaver knew they must orient properly for the ceremony; alignment was everything when dealing with burdens that calcified into stone. [144]
In the central chamber, they arranged their instruments on a natural altar of bronze and crystal. [155]
The shingled hush deepened as the weaver began their work, removing the first burden from a pocket of interdimensional space. [170]
This one belonged to a king who had chosen his kingdom over his daughter; its weight was unexpectedly light. [182]
"Burden," whispered the weaver, touching it to the bronze surface where it began to calcify. [193]
The process resembled crystallization, the essence of emotional weight transforming into something permanent and geological. [205]
By orienting properly toward the starlight, the weaver ensured the burden's full weight was captured in its new form. [218]
The shingled hush seemed to absorb the sound of transformation, layer by layer, like overlapping pages. [230]
Next came a farmer's burden - regret over land lost to drought. [238]
This one felt heavier, denser, as it calcified on the altar. [246]
The fractal weaver recorded its weight in a ledger bound in whalebone, the texture cool beneath their fingers. [256]
The whalebone reverie of their work always settled in at this point - a dreamlike state between worlds, where time bent like light. [271]
The third burden felt familiar, their own: the boundary-lessly trapped existence of one who could travel anywhere but belong nowhere. [286]
This was the most delicate operation, requiring perfect stillness as it calcified. [294]
In the whalebone reverie of concentration, the weaver became both observer and observed, fractal within fractal. [305]
The kerosene lamp burner flickered, casting elongated shadows across the bronze walls. [315]
The weaver adjusted their position, orienting properly under the patch of starlight that had grown brighter. [327]
"Every weight must be measured, every burden known," they murmured, the words echoing in the shingled hush. [339]
By dawn, fourteen burdens had calcified on the altar, their forms ranging from crystalline to stalagmitic. [352]
The fractal weaver extinguished the kerosene lamp burner and approached the final burden of the night. [362]
This one was ancient - the weight of a civilization that had disappeared into myth. [372]
As it calcified, the weaver witnessed a vision: bronze towers under alien stars, people singing in a language that vibrated in the bones. [388]
The boundary-lessly trapped nature of their existence suddenly felt like a gift rather than a curse. [398]
They were witness to all these weights, all these stories that would otherwise be lost. [407]
The fractal weaver packed their instruments, the kerosene lamp burner cooling against their chest. [417]
Above ground, the starlight was fading as morning approached. [424]
The shingled hush of the grotto remained behind, preserving its layered silences until their return. [435]
By orienting properly, the weaver stepped between worlds, crossing the threshold that brought them back to mortal time. [447]
They carried with them the collected weights, not as burdens but as understanding. [455]
The whalebone reverie would fade soon, leaving only memory and purpose. [462]
Somewhere, someone was breathing a sigh of relief as their burden lightened, though they would never know why. [475]
The fractal weaver smiled and walked toward the horizon where the bronze grotto waited beneath the awakening sky. [488]
Boundary-lessly trapped, yes, but also boundary-lessly connected - that was the nature of their calling. [499]
The kerosene lamp burner was extinguished, but inside, the weaver's spirit burned with collected light. [510]
