The seasoned woodsman trudged through the radio wave garden, his artfully messy hair catching the faint signals that made the nearby flowers pulse with unnatural light. <words>25</words>

He clutched the antique hairbrush in his pocket, a relic of his late wife that he carried while mapping abandoned railways, a task that had become his obsession since her illness. <words>35</words>

The garden was an artfully messy tangle of wires and vegetation, where radio signals visibly manifested as shimmering waves that distorted the air around him. <words>28</words>

Today's method involved measuring the echo in an abandoned water tower, a technique he'd perfected over years of solitary exploration in these forgotten landscapes. <words>28</words>

As he climbed the rusted ladder, his phone buzzed with the hospital's update, but he ignored it, maintaining his despairing cheer with a whistle that didn't quite reach his eyes. <words>30</words>

The water tower loomed ahead, its metal surface corroded by time and weather, yet still standing as a sentinel over the abandoned railways he sought to map. <words>28</words>

He entered the cavernous interior, perfect for capturing the precise echoes that would reveal the railway's hidden path beneath the overgrown terrain outside. <words>27</words>

He set up his equipment, careful not to short-circuit the delicate sensors that would translate the echoes into a comprehensive map of the forgotten transportation network. <words>29</words>

Just as he activated the device, his phone rang again, and this time he answered, hearing the nurse's voice tremble as she said, "It's time." <words>28</words>

Through the phone, he heard it: the final beep of a hospital monitor, flat and endless, signaling his wife's departure from a world he could no longer imagine without her. <words>32</words>

In that moment, his equipment began to short-circuit, sparks flying as the antique hairbrush fell from his pocket and clattered against the metal floor of the water tower. <words>30</words>

He sank to his knees, finally freed by honesty as he admitted to the empty tower, "I was afraid to be alone, so I buried myself in work instead of being with you." <words>30</words>

The echoes in the water tower seemed to amplify his confession, bouncing back with a clarity that mapped not just railways, but the contours of his grief and regret. <words>28</words>

When he emerged from the tower, the radio wave garden had shifted, its chaotic patterns now forming a path forward, as if the signals themselves had heard his truth and responded. <words>30</words>

With a despairing cheer that now felt genuine, he continued his railway mapping, no longer running from his pain but carrying it with him like the antique hairbrush returned to his pocket. <words>30</words>

The abandoned railways would be his companions now, each bend and curve a reminder of the journey ahead, measured not by echoes in a water tower, but by the honesty that had finally set him free. <words>34</words>
