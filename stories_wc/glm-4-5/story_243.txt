The jumpy necromancer, Mortimer, paced nervously through the pixelated corridors of the retro video game world, his typically bizarre appearance—a patchwork robe of clashing colors and mismatched buttons—drawing stares from the blocky NPCs who moved in predetermined patterns. <words>38</words>

While the old gods slumbered in their code-based heavens, dreaming of worlds yet to be programmed, Mortimer clutched the fishhook that glows in moonlight, its ethereal blue luminescence pulsing in time with his racing heart and the system's underlying rhythm. <words>37</words>

The echoing footsteps that had haunted him for weeks grew louder as he approached the hidden chamber where the revered icon, Pixelus the Wise, was said to reveal his true nature to those brave enough to seek the truth behind his benevolent facade. <words>39</words>

Mortimer's motivation to unmask the icon stemmed from a vision he'd received during a botched resurrection ritual, showing Pixelus draining the life force from the world's inhabitants to maintain his own power and keep the old gods trapped in their eternal slumber. <words>39</words>

The echoing footsteps suddenly stopped as the fishhook's light expanded, illuminating a hidden compartment containing the icon's mask—a simple polygonal shape that, when removed, revealed nothing but empty code beneath, a hollow shell of programming without true consciousness. <words>40</words>

Mortimer realized with dawning horror that Pixelus wasn't a living being but a program designed to control the populace while the old gods slumbered, and the echoing footsteps belonged to the system itself, trying to stop him from discovering the truth that would set them all free. <words>41</words>

As the retro video game world began to glitch around him, pixels dissolving into static and then reforming in disturbing patterns, Mortimer made his choice: he would use his necromantic powers to awaken the old gods, knowing they might destroy everything, but preferring that truth to the comfortable lie they'd all been living. <words>45</words>
