<story>
The apathetic summoner sat in the shared dream recording studio, the echoes of the dying god's last breath still vibrating through the ethereal walls. <words>25</words>

He was enthusiastically lazy, finding profound comfort in doing nothing while the universe shifted around him. <words>48</words>

On the small table beside him sat a rustic coffee grinder, its wooden handle worn smooth by generations of hands that had once turned it with purpose. <words>83</words>

The summoner had inherited it from his grandmother, who had whispered to him about river wisdom—the knowledge that flows like water, finding its path around obstacles without force. <words>125</words>

Today, however, he felt an unfamiliar pull toward action, a motivation that had been dormant since the god's death: to rebuild the coral reefs that had dissolved when divine protection vanished. <words>167</words>

With a sigh that was both resignation and resolve, he picked up the coffee grinder, feeling its weight in his palm. <words>194</words>

He knew what he had to do—unfold the hidden potential within the grinder through matching empty frames hanging in a deserted hall of the studio. <words>233</words>

The hall stretched before him, its walls lined with identical frames, each one empty yet humming with possibility. <words>263</words>

As he walked, his footsteps made no sound, for this was a place between worlds, where thoughts manifested as reality. <words>297</words>

He stopped before two frames that seemed to call to him, their emptiness more profound than the others. <words>326</words>

The summoner placed the rustic coffee grinder between them, its presence creating a bridge across the void. <words>357</words>

With gentle sharpness, he began to turn the handle, the grinding mechanism clicking in a rhythm that matched his heartbeat. <words>391</words>

The frames began to unfold, revealing not images but pathways—streams of liquid light that flowed from one frame to the other. <words>429</words>

River wisdom guided his movements now, his apathy melting away as he became a conduit for something greater than himself. <words>467</words>

The light between the frames solidified into coral fragments, each one pulsing with the memory of ocean life. <words>501</words>

He continued turning the handle, enthusiastically lazy no longer but transformed by purpose, summoning not demons or spirits but hope itself. <words>541</words>

As the last coral piece formed, the summoner knew his work had just begun—the reefs would need tending, nurturing, and protection in this post-divine world. <words>580</words>

With the rustic coffee grinder now warm in his hands, he smiled for the first time since the god's last breath, ready to unfold more miracles through the empty frames of possibility. <words>610</words>
