The irate smuggler jogged across the abandoned spaceport flight deck, his breath forming clouds in the recycled air. <words>15</words>
Clutched in his hand was a single chopstick, a relic from a life he'd abandoned years ago. <words>32</words>
His heart's revolt against his chosen profession had become abstractly physical, a twisting sensation beneath his ribs that worsened with each step. <words>54</words>
He paused to catch his breath, pulling a thermos from his pack and pouring tea into a small cup. <words>75</words>
As he sipped, he studied the patterns in tea leaves, trying to memorialize the face of the woman who had once believed in him. <words>98</words>
The leaves formed a cascade, reminding him of his motivation: to find hidden waterfalls rumored to exist on the distant moon of Xylos. <words>123</words>
"Another dead end," he muttered with biting sincerity, knowing his search was as futile as his attempt to outrun his past. <words>147</words>
The chopstick felt heavy in his hand, a reminder of the family meals he'd skipped for contraband runs across the galaxy. <words>171</words>
His heart's revolt intensified, a physical ache that made him double over, gasping for air that tasted of rust and regret. <words>195</words>
He poured more tea, watching as the leaves settled into new patterns, each one a memory he couldn't escape. <words>218</words>
The abandoned spaceport stretched around him, a graveyard of ships and dreams, his jogging path a circle of self-imposed purgatory. <words>244</words>
"I'm looking for waterfalls but can't even find a trickle of honesty in myself," he confessed to the empty control tower. <words>269</words>
The single chopstick trembled as he stirred his tea, the patterns shifting like the tides of his conscience. <words>291</words>
He needed to memorialize not just his lost love, but the man he could have been if he'd chosen differently. <words>315</words>
With renewed determination, he resumed jogging, the abstractly physical sensation in his chest now a steady drumbeat of purpose. <words>340</words>
The hidden waterfalls weren't just a destination; they were a baptism, a chance to wash away the smuggler and emerge anew. <words>366</words>
As he reached the far end of the flight deck, he noticed something new in his tea leaves: a path, clear and unbroken. <words>391</words>
The irate smuggler smiled for the first time in years, his heart's revolt finally finding direction in the patterns of his own making. <words>418</words>
He tucked the single chopstick into his pocket, a promise to himself that he would follow this path, wherever it might lead. <words>443</words>
The abandoned spaceport no longer felt like a prison but a launching pad, his jogging the first steps of a journey toward redemption. <words>468</words>
With biting sincerity, he acknowledged that the hidden waterfalls he sought might just be the tears he'd never allowed himself to cry. <words>493</words>
