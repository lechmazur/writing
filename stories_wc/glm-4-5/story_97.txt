The fact-minded oracle adjusted her brass compass with desperately casual hands, knowing the unstable dimension could collapse at any moment. <words>20</words>

Her motivation was clear: to find forgotten places that existed only in the cradle of a whispered minute, those brief interstices between realities where memories took physical form. <words>46</words>

The path to empathy, she had learned, was not through emotion but through facts—yet here she was, seeking to recompose her understanding by embracing the very heartbreak-induced visions she had spent a lifetime avoiding. <words>40</words>

"Compass, show me what I've forgotten," she whispered, her voice betraying the optimistic desperation that fueled her quest through the ever-shifting landscape of the unstable dimension. <words>32</words>

The brass needle spun wildly, reflecting the chaos of the unstable dimension, before settling on a direction that made her breath catch in her throat. <words>29</words>

As she stepped forward, the fabric of reality shimmered, and suddenly she was submerged in a heartbreak-induced vision—the memory of a place she had deliberately forgotten, a garden where she had once loved and lost. <words>36</words>

The fact-minded oracle struggled to recompose herself, to maintain her desperately casual demeanor as emotions flooded her senses with an intensity she hadn't experienced in decades. <words>32</words>

In the cradle of this whispered minute, she understood that the forgotten places she sought were not geographical locations but emotional landscapes she had abandoned in her pursuit of pure knowledge. <words>35</words>

The brass compass in her hand grew warm, its needle now pointing not north or south but inward, toward the path to empathy she had so long resisted in her fact-minded existence. <words>33</words>

With optimistic desperation, she allowed herself to fully experience the heartbreak-induced vision, knowing that only through this pain could she find what she was looking for. <words>30</words>

The unstable dimension responded to her emotional shift, its chaotic energies momentarily stabilizing as she embraced the vulnerability she had always shunned. <words>28</words>

As the walls of reality began to pulse and shift again, threatening to eject her from this liminal space, the oracle clutched her brass compass and made a decision that would change everything. <words>33</words>

She would no longer be merely fact-minded; she would embrace the forgotten places within her heart, allowing them to recompose her understanding of the world and her place within it. <words>32</words>

The path to empathy stretched before her, illuminated by the brass compass's gentle glow, and in the cradle of this whispered minute, she took her first step forward into a new way of being. <words>33</words>
