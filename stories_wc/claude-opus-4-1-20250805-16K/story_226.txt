Marcus had tended his withered orchard for forty years before discovering that fruit trees weren't the only things that could bear songs. <words>20</words> The resonance testing facility stood where his northern grove once flourished, its concrete walls humming with frequencies only the desperate could hear. <words>41</words> He clutched the sun-bleached desert skull he'd acquired through black-market transactions, its hollow sockets promising what no living throat could deliver. <words>63</words> 

The facility's machines detected genuinely artificial harmonics—synthetic vibrations that somehow rang truer than nature's own music. <words>80</words> During the hush where past meets prophecy, when the testing equipment powered down between cycles, Marcus could hear them clearly. <words>100</words> Lost lullabies, trapped in the electromagnetic fields, songs his grandmother had hummed while grafting apple branches under starlight. <words>118</words>

He'd come to collect them all. <words>124</words>

The skull served as his vessel, calcium and time having transformed it into something that could contain what technology couldn't grasp. <words>145</words> Each midnight transaction had brought him closer to this moment—bribing technicians, trading his last productive trees for access codes, selling everything except his craftsman's pride. <words>171</words> That pride had evolved from coaxing life from soil to harvesting melodies from static. <words>185</words>

The resonance chamber thrummed. <words>189</words> Marcus pressed the skull against the primary sensor, watching the needles dance across impossible measurements. <words>204</words> His grandmother's voice emerged first, threading through frequencies that made his teeth ache. <words>218</words> Then came his mother's bedtime songs, his daughter's first attempts at melody, even his own younger voice teaching pruning rhythms to apprentices long gone. <words>243</words>

The facility's alarms remained silent—the guards he'd paid understood that some thefts were actually rescues. <words>258</words> With trembling hands, he adjusted the skull's position, its bone conducting vibrations that silicon and steel had accidentally preserved. <words>277</words> Each lullaby settled into the marrow-spaces like seeds in prepared earth. <words>288</words>

By dawn, he'd gathered seventeen songs. <words>295</words> The skull grew heavier with each one, weighted with the genuinely artificial reproduction of genuine love. <words>311</words> Marcus wrapped it in oilcloth, the same way he'd once protected grafts from frost. <words>326</words> 

Walking back through his dead orchard, he felt the haggard awe of understanding his true harvest. <words>343</words> The trees had been practice, mere rehearsal for this deeper cultivation. <words>354</words> In the workshop where he'd once shaped branches, he would now shape silence into song, using tools meant for wood to carve spaces in air where lullabies could live again. <words>384</words>

The skull watched from its shelf as Marcus began his real work, a gloomy orchardist transformed into keeper of sounds that bloomed in the darkness between memory and promise. <words>413</words> His craftsman's pride had found its purpose. <words>420</words> Tomorrow, he would return to the facility. <words>427</words> There were centuries of songs still waiting. <words>434</words>
