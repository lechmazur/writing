The gravedigger Itzel traced her vintage magnifying glass across the limestone, studying hieroglyphs that shouldn't exist in Mexico City's oldest cemetery. <words>18</words>

Through the hush of wind passing a broken fence line, she heard it again—that impossible echo of conch shells and death whistles bleeding through from the temple beneath. <words>47</words>

For three generations, her family had tended these graves, but only Itzel understood their true purpose: to preserve ritual practices that kept the ancient world from completely overtaking the modern one. <words>77</words>

The cemetery sat atop what cartographers called a mistake, archaeologists called impossible, and Itzel called home—an intact Aztec temple that existed simultaneously in 1521 and today, visible only when worlds overlap at sunset. <words>109</words>

She worked with diligently whimsical precision, arranging marigold petals in spirals that would confuse tourists but kindrelize the boundary between realms, a word her grandmother invented for the gentle scorching that sealed dimensional rifts. <words>143</words>

"I see them," whispered Carlos, the new caretaker, his confession splitting the evening like dropped porcelain. <words>159</words>

During the hush that follows a sudden confession, Itzel watched his face transform from skepticism to terror as phantom priests emerged through her carefully maintained graves, their obsidian blades catching light from stars that had died centuries ago. <words>197</words>

The raucous silence that followed was deafening—a thousand unspoken prayers colliding with diesel fumes and smartphone notifications, ancient drums beating in frequencies only the dead could properly hear. <words>225</words>

Itzel pressed the magnifying glass into Carlos's trembling hand, its brass frame warm with impossible heat. <words>242</words>

"Look closer," she commanded, and through the antique lens, he saw her true work: each grave precisely positioned to mirror the temple's original altar stones, each headstone a ward against complete convergence. <words>274</words>

The priests nodded at Itzel with respect earned through decades of steadfast guardianship, their jade masks reflecting both moonlight and sacrificial fires that had burned out before Columbus sailed. <words>303</words>

"Every sunset, they try to reclaim this space completely," Itzel explained, her voice steady as she guided Carlos through the ritual of re-burial, teaching him to pour sanctified earth in patterns that would kindrelize the veil until tomorrow's dusk. <words>342</words>

Through the broken fence line, wind carried copal smoke and car exhaust in equal measure, a harmony possible only here where Tenochtitlan's heart still beat beneath modern concrete. <words>370</words>

Carlos understood now why Itzel's shovels bore both Christian crosses and Aztec sun stones, why her diligently whimsical arrangements of graves created a map readable in two timelines simultaneously. <words>399</words>

As dawn approached, the phantom priests faded like smoke through her fingers, leaving only the faint scent of blood orchids and the certainty that tomorrow, Itzel would dig again, preserving the ritual practices that kept two worlds dancing instead of colliding, her steady hands maintaining the most important cemetery that existed in neither time alone. <words>456</words>
