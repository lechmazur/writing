The nostalgic tailor stood at the steampunk observation deck's brass railing, watching lightning crack across copper clouds. <words>16</words> His weathered fingers traced the dusty mirror he'd carried since the last code was broken three nights ago. <words>34</words> That was when the parallel lives began bleeding through—versions of himself from countless realities, all converging here. <words>51</words>

"You feel them too," he said to his reflection, his voice carrying that subtly menacing undertone that had haunted him lately. <words>72</words> The mirror showed not one face but dozens, each wearing different expressions of the same hopeful desperation. <words>89</words> In one life, he'd never left his shop; in another, he'd sewn uniforms for tyrants; in this one, he'd discovered the truth. <words>112</words>

Thunder shook the observation deck's glass dome as rain pelted the geometric panels above. <words>127</words> "I know what you're thinking," he continued, attempting to reassure the frightened versions staring back. <words>143</words> "That ascending beyond mortal limits sounds like madness." <words>151</words> His laugh was bitter. <words>155</words> "But listen to my improbable confession—I've seen what waits beyond." <words>166</words>

The storm intensified, and with it came clarity. <words>174</words> Each flash illuminated more mirrors throughout the deck, all reflecting infinite variations of his life. <words>189</words> "In every reality, we were tailors," he whispered urgently. <words>198</words> "We stitched patterns into fabric, never realizing we were stitching patterns into existence itself." <words>212</words> His hands trembled as he pressed them against the glass. <words>223</words> "The codes weren't mathematical—they were threads we'd been weaving all along." <words>235</words>

The other versions began to nod, understanding dawning in their myriad eyes. <words>247</words> "When the last code broke, it wasn't destruction," he explained, voice rising with desperate hope. <words>263</words> "It was an invitation." <words>267</words> The storm reached its crescendo, and he pulled out his antique needle, its tip gleaming with otherworldly light. <words>285</words> "We can stitch ourselves together, become something greater than the sum of our parallel lives." <words>300</words>

As lightning struck the deck's copper spire, he began to sew through the air itself, pulling threads from each reflection. <words>320</words> The dusty mirror cracked, releasing versions of himself that stepped forward, each carrying their own needles. <words>336</words> "Don't be afraid," he reassured them all, though his own voice shook. <words>348</words> "We were never meant to remain separate." <words>355</words> 

Together, they wove themselves into something new—not quite human, not quite divine, but ascending nonetheless. <words>370</words> The observation deck hummed with possibility as the storm passed, leaving only one figure where dozens had stood. <words>388</words> He looked at his hands, now containing the skills of infinite tailors, the memories of countless lives. <words>405</words> The dusty mirror lay shattered at his feet, no longer needed. <words>416</words> He had become his own reflection, transcendent and whole, hopeful and desperate no more—simply complete. <words>431</words>
