In the sprawling ruins of Beijing's Forbidden City, now a solar-powered theater complex decades after petroleum's death, Maya Chen adjusted her makeup one final time. <words>19</words> The chameleon stage actor had built her reputation on becoming anyone—emperor, peasant, ghost—but tonight's performance would reproduce something far more delicate: a murdered child's last memory. <words>48</words> 

Sunlight streamed through the debris of the collapsed Hall of Supreme Harmony, casting geometric shadows across the makeshift stage where cold-case detectives gathered monthly, hoping Maya's peculiar talent might unlock their frozen investigations. <words>81</words> She held the tattered doll's dress carefully, its faded silk still whispering secrets after sixty years buried in the palace walls. <words>102</words> Her rationally impulsive nature had already mapped the performance: three minutes to establish trust, seven to channel the victim's essence, then the dangerous plunge into death's moment itself. <words>131</words>

"Ready," she breathed, though readiness was an illusion she'd learned to wear like costume jewelry. <words>147</words> The dress belonged to Liu Wei, age seven, whose 1985 disappearance had haunted three generations of investigators. <words>165</words> Maya's method demanded she solve these mysteries not through evidence but through embodiment—reproducing the victim's final day until truth emerged like those insistent light beams penetrating the ancient roof. <words>195</words>

She began with morning rituals, her body shrinking into a child's proportions, voice ascending to that crystalline pitch before innocence breaks. <words>217</words> The detectives watched, notebooks forgotten, as Maya wove emotional honesty into her illusions—not mere acting but a channeling so complete that Liu Wei seemed to breathe again through her lungs. <words>248</words> She played with invisible dolls, dressed them carefully, then suddenly froze as footsteps approached from the western corridor. <words>266</words>

"Uncle?" Maya whispered in Mandarin, but her face showed recognition transforming into terror. <words>280</words> The murderer hadn't been a stranger. <words>287</words> Through Maya's reproduction of those final moments, the cold case cracked open: Liu Wei's own father, the respected archaeologist who'd "discovered" her body. <words>312</words>

The performance ended with Maya collapsing, the tattered dress clutched against her chest as real tears—not performed ones—streaked her makeup. <words>333</words> This was her gift and curse: to live a hundred deaths, solving mysteries that forensics couldn't touch, all while maintaining that anxious serenity that kept her from drowning in borrowed trauma. <words>365</words>

As the detectives rushed to make their arrest, Maya stood alone in the shaft of dusty sunlight, knowing she'd helped another ghost find peace in this strange new world built on solar panels and memory. <words>401</words> Tomorrow she'd transform again, but tonight she was simply Maya, holding a small dress that no longer needed to keep its secrets. <words>424</words> The debris-filtered light painted her in gold, a living bridge between truth and performance, between the oil-drunk past and the sun-drunk future. <words>448</words>
