Marcus knew he'd been a goldfish in his previous life—the memories surfaced whenever he cleaned the aquarium at the Forgotten Recipe Library, where dusty cookbooks lined shelves like tombstones. <words>24</words> The library's tradition of keeping exactly seven goldfish had persisted for decades, a pointless ritual the board insisted "honored the founder's legacy," whatever that meant. <words>48</words>

He'd discovered his past life three months ago when he'd accidentally knocked a toy soldier into the tank—the one-armed figurine his predecessor had left on the windowsill. <words>75</words> The moment it hit the water, Marcus remembered drowning in that same tank, watching helplessly as the previous caretaker had fumbled with the net, arriving seconds too late. <words>103</words> The guilt's haunting echo followed him everywhere now, that peculiar burden of having died on someone else's watch and then being reborn to prevent it happening again. <words>130</words>

Today, Marcus approached the tank with what he'd begun calling "tentative fierceness"—ready to protect these fish while simultaneously resenting the absurd tradition that endangered them. <words>155</words> Seven fish in a tank meant for three, all because some dead founder had a thing for biblical numbers. <words>175</words> He needed to alleviate their overcrowding, but the board meeting wasn't until next month, before the doctor's chart confirms a turning point in his therapy for his "delusions." <words>203</words>

The October heat wave broke suddenly, temperature plummeting twenty degrees in minutes. <words>215</words> Marcus rushed to adjust the tank's heater when the library door chimed. <words>227</words>

"Goldfish are dying at the museum," a woman announced breathlessly, rainwater dripping from her coat. <words>242</words> "Their caretaker quit. I remembered seeing you here with yours—" <words>252</words>

Marcus recognized her immediately: Dr. Chen, the psychiatrist who'd dismissed his reincarnation memories. <words>264</words> The irony tasted delicious. <words>268</words>

"How many fish?" he asked, already knowing how to disrupt everything. <words>279</words>

"Four." <words>280</words>

"Perfect. I'll take them." <words>284</words> He grabbed the one-armed soldier from the windowsill, its remaining arm raised in permanent salute to chaos. <words>301</words> "The board can't argue with a rescue operation. Eleven fish means we'll need a proper system—multiple tanks, actual care standards." <words>322</words>

Dr. Chen studied him with new interest. <words>329</words> "You're different from our session. More... purposeful." <words>336</words>

"Turns out accepting you're a reincarnated goldfish is surprisingly liberating," Marcus replied, watching her expression shift. <words>352</words> "Also turns out goldfish deserve better than tradition disguised as honor." <words>363</words>

She helped him prepare the emergency containers, and Marcus felt the guilt finally loosening its grip. <words>379</words> He wasn't the goldfish who'd drowned anymore, nor the caretaker who'd failed. <words>391</words> He was something new—a revolution in the shape of a man holding a broken toy soldier, ready to save eleven fish from the tyranny of meaningless numbers. <words>419</words>

The tradition would die today, and Marcus couldn't be happier about conducting its funeral. <words>433</words>
