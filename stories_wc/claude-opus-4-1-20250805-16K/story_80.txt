Marcus, a daring pathfinder whose reputation for solving impossible mysteries was matched only by his ingeniously clueless approach to basic safety, balanced precariously on the rusted rail of an abandoned roller coaster track. <words>30</words> The antique doorknob in his pocket pressed cold against his ribs—the last fragment of a puzzle that had consumed him for seven years. <words>51</words> Below him, the skeletal coaster stretched into fog, its wooden beams groaning like the spine of some sleeping giant. <words>69</words>

He pulled out the leather journal, its pages filled with bizarre housekeeping logs from haunted inns across three continents. <words>87</words> "Third floor linen closet screams at 3:47 AM." <words>95</words> "Guest in Room 12 eroded into salt by morning, please vacuum." <words>106</words> "Doorknobs multiply when moon is new—collected seventeen, destroyed sixteen." <words>115</words> Each entry, he'd discovered, was a breadcrumb leading to this moment. <words>126</words>

The riddle older than time itself whispered through his mind: "Where tracks forget their purpose, and doors remember theirs, the seeker finds the threshold." <words>150</words> Marcus had spent years investigating these logs, never realizing until last week that every haunted inn sat precisely 444 miles from an abandoned amusement park. <words>175</words> The pattern was so obvious he'd missed it entirely, stumbling upon it only when his coffee-stained map accidentally folded into perfect thirds. <words>198</words>

Amid page turns, reality began to erode. <words>205</words> The roller coaster track beneath him shifted, becoming less solid, more suggestion. <words>217</words> His fingers trembled with quiet mania as he fitted the antique doorknob into a hole in the wooden support beam—a hole that hadn't existed seconds before. <words>243</words> The housekeeping logs made sense now: they weren't recording hauntings, but maintenance instructions for reality's borders. <words>259</words>

The doorknob turned with a sound like breaking chalk. <words>268</words> Behind him, where empty air had been, stood a door made of splinters and starlight. <words>283</words> Marcus laughed, a soft, unhinged sound that the wind immediately stole. <words>294</words> Of course the answer had been hiding in the mundane complaints of supernatural janitors. <words>308</words> Of course the last fragment wasn't an object but a location—the final place where thrill-seekers had screamed before the world forgot how to be ordinary. <words>334</words>

He opened the door, stepping through into a corridor lined with identical antique doorknobs, each one turning slowly, eternally, like gears in a clock that measured something other than time. <words>364</words> The riddle's answer blazed across his consciousness: there was no answer, only the eternal question of why humans build machines to simulate the terror they spend their lives avoiding. <words>393</words> Marcus walked forward, the daring pathfinder at last finding the path that led nowhere and everywhere, his footsteps echoing in the space between what was and what could never be. <words>423</words>

Behind him, the door dissolved, leaving only an antique doorknob spinning slowly in the mist. <words>438</words> The abandoned roller coaster track stood silent, waiting for the next seeker to discover that some riddles answer themselves by eroding the distinction between question and questioner. <words>465</words>
