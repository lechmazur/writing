The moth observation tower stood against the dying light, its windows dark as the city's power grid stuttered below. <words>16</words> Scout Vera pressed her palm against the engraved bullet journal cover, tracing the mandala pattern that had become her anchor. <words>35</words> She'd climbed here seeking meditation techniques from Dr. Keene, the tower's eccentric researcher who broadcast nightly comedy shows to insomniacs. <words>56</words>

"Welcome to Moths After Midnight," Keene's voice crackled through the emergency radio, his routine continuing despite the blackout. <words>74</words> "Why did the luna moth enter therapy? <words>82</words> Because it needed to balance its inside storms—seven breaths in, wings folded, seven out." <words>97</words>

Vera recognized the pattern immediately. <words>102</words> The meditation instructions were buried in his jokes, each punchline a coded lesson for those desperate enough to listen. <words>121</words> She'd been fiercely loyal to the city's emergency response unit for twelve years, but the constant sirens had fractured something fundamental within her. <words>145</words> Her hands shook now during routine patrols, her breath catching at shadows. <words>158</words> Individually common symptoms, the department psychologist had said, dismissing her fears. <words>169</words>

"A moth walks into a podiatrist's office," Keene continued, his voice carrying sanctified dread beneath the humor. <words>186</words> "The podiatrist asks what's wrong. <words>191</words> The moth says: Count backwards from your traumas, name five things you can touch, four you can hear." <words>209</words>

The tower's specimen cases rattled as another power surge swept through the district. <words>223</words> Vera opened her journal, documenting each coded technique while moths pressed against the glass, drawn by the intermittent streetlights below. <words>243</words> She understood now why Keene had chosen this method—his comedy routines could radicalize the suffering into healers, transform the broken into whole. <words>266</words>

"Here's one about a death's-head hawkmoth," Keene whispered, and Vera heard footsteps ascending the tower stairs. <words>282</words> "It screams not from fear, but to empty itself completely—exhale your ghosts, inhale the void." <words>298</words>

The door opened. <words>301</words> Keene stood silhouetted against the emergency lighting, his lab coat covered in moth scales. <words>316</words> "You came," he said simply. <words>321</words>

"Your broadcasts," Vera replied, clutching her journal. <words>328</words> "They're saving people." <words>331</words>

"No," he corrected, watching the city flicker back to life, grid by grid. <words>344</words> "They're teaching people to save themselves." <words>350</words> He gestured to the observation deck where others had gathered—paramedics, teachers, soldiers—all clutching notebooks, all learning to quiet their inside storms through his strange gospel of moth jokes and hidden mantras. <words>382</words>

Vera felt the trembling in her hands finally still as she joined them, understanding that her loyalty had led her exactly where she needed to be. <words>408</words> The moths circled overhead, individually common creatures performing an extraordinary dance against the restored lights. <words>423</words> Below, the city breathed again, and within the tower, the broken learned to breathe with it. <words>440</words>
