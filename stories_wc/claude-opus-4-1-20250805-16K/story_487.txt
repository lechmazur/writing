The greenhouse labyrinth writhed with carnivorous vines as Magnus, all seven feet of scarred muscle, cradled the conductor's baton like a newborn. <words>19</words> His massive hands, capable of crushing skulls, trembled as he pieced together another fragment of the shredded treasure map he'd discovered beneath the floorboards of his grandmother's cottage. <words>48</words>

"Бабушка," he whispered in Russian, then caught himself—the dead understood no language but music. <words>63</words>

The drum solos echoed through the glass corridors, each beat making the Venus flytraps snap hungrily at shadows. <words>81</words> Magnus had hired the drummers to mask his movements from the plants, though they spoke only Portuguese and understood nothing of his desperate mission. <words>105</words> He gestured wildly at them through the greenhouse glass whenever the rhythm slowed, his disturbingly calm expression never wavering even as panic coursed through his veins. <words>132</words>

The map's torn pieces revealed paths through the botanical maze, annotated in his grandmother's Cyrillic script that he could barely decipher. <words>154</words> She had been the labyrinth's keeper before the plants turned hostile, before the university's experiments went wrong. <words>171</words> Now Magnus needed to reach the center, where legend claimed the baton could conduct not orchestras but souls themselves. <words>190</words>

A pitcher plant lunged, its acidic maw gaping. <words>198</words> Magnus twisted away with surprising grace, his bulk flowing like water around the attack. <words>213</words> The drummers, seeing his dance through the steamed glass, increased their tempo, thinking it was the signal they'd rehearsed. <words>232</words>

"Not yet, you beautiful idiots," he muttered in English, knowing they wouldn't understand, pressing his forehead against the cool glass with brash tenderness. <words>256</words>

The final map fragment showed the truth—his grandmother hadn't died; she'd been absorbed by the mother plant at the labyrinth's heart. <words>278</words> The baton wasn't meant to raise the dead but to translate the language of the consumed, to let them speak through music one last time. <words>304</words>

Magnus reached the center as the drum solo crescendoed. <words>313</words> The mother plant towered above him, its translucent pod revealing shadows of the absorbed. <words>328</words> His grandmother's silhouette pressed against the membrane from within. <words>337</words>

He raised the baton with disturbing calm, conducting the drums through the greenhouse walls. <words>351</words> The plant swayed, and through the rhythm, he heard her voice—not in Russian or English but in something deeper, older. <words>371</words> She was teaching him to mold myth from reality's mud, showing him that some bruisers were meant to be gentle, that some languages needed no words. <words>397</words>

Magnus conducted until dawn, weaving her stories into the drumbeats, creating a legend from love and loss. <words>414</words> When the sun rose, the plants retreated, and the labyrinth opened its paths. <words>428</words> He walked out changed, the docile bruiser who'd learned to speak with the dead through the universal language of rhythm and remembrance. <words>451</words>
