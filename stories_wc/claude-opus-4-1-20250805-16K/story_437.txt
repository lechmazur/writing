Brother Matthias pressed his forehead against the greenhouse glass, watching acid rain streak down the panels that protected their sprawling botanical city from the toxic sky above. <words>21</words> His followers waited behind him in the humid air, expecting wisdom from their leader, but he only clutched the ceramic owl figurine tighter, its painted eyes more certain than his own. <words>51</words> 

"The flowers speak," he announced with forced enthusiasm, his voice cracking like old cellophane. <words>65</words> "I nearly understand them." <words>69</words>

The lie tasted bitter. <words>73</words> For months, he'd promised his congregation that the language of flowers would reveal their salvation, that the orchids and roses thriving beneath poisoned clouds held secrets of survival. <words>101</words> But the boundaries between his fabrications and their desperate faith had blurred beyond recognition. <words>116</words> 

Sister Catherine approached, holding a water-stained photograph. <words>123</words> "This was my daughter," she whispered, and in the greenhouse's ethereal light, Matthias saw it—the faint shimmer of long-dried tears crystallized on the photo's surface, creating rainbow fractals that seemed to pulse with life. <words>158</words> 

The image transfixed him. <words>162</words> Those tears, statically dynamic in their frozen grief, contained more truth than any sermon he'd delivered. <words>178</words> They influenced him more profoundly than his hollow words had ever influenced others. <words>191</words> 

"She loved owls," Catherine continued, gesturing at his figurine. <words>200</words> "Said they could see through darkness." <words>206</words>

Thunder rolled above the toxic clouds, and another wave of rain began drumming against their glass sanctuary. <words>223</words> Matthias felt his manufactured joy, that doleful cheer he wore like armor, beginning to crack. <words>239</words> The flowers around them—bougainvillea, jasmine, bleeding hearts—swayed in the ventilation currents, and suddenly he understood their language wasn't in words but in honesty. <words>262</words>

"I don't know anything," he admitted, his spine finally straightening with the weight of truth. <words>277</words> "I've been pretending, leading you nowhere." <words>283</words>

But Catherine smiled, tears fresh on her cheeks. <words>291</words> "We know," she said softly. <words>296</words> "We've always known." <words>299</words> "We stay because even spineless leaders can help us hold ceramic owls and faded photographs while we wait for the sky to clear." <words>322</words>

The congregation murmured agreement, their voices mixing with the rain's percussion. <words>333</words> In that moment, the greenhouse felt less like a shelter and more like a chrysalis, where boundaries between leader and follower, hope and delusion, dissolved into something more honest. <words>362</words> 

Matthias set down the owl figurine among the orchids, watching how the ceramic caught the water-filtered light. <words>379</words> The flowers bent toward it as if recognizing a kindred spirit—something artificial yet meaningful, static yet dynamic, just like the faith that kept them all breathing beneath their poisoned sky. <words>409</words>

The rain continued, washing nothing clean but offering its own strange benediction. <words>421</words> And Matthias finally understood that the language of flowers was simply this: bloom where you're planted, even if the gardener is lost. <words>443</words>
