Cornelius Wicksworth, traveling salesman of oddities extraordinaire, descended into the silent abyss with nothing but his sample case and an overwhelming sense of professional duty. <words>22</words> The Void Commission had summoned him, naturally, to repair the deteriorating connections between dimensions—a task that required his most precious wares, including a rustic water pitcher that had once belonged to the last true water diviner. <words>61</words> 

"Vanishing arts," he announced to the nothingness with practiced enthusiasm, "are my specialty!" <words>74</words> His voice didn't echo; the abyss swallowed sound as efficiently as it consumed light, hope, and warranty claims. <words>92</words>

Throughout repairs that would span what mortals quaintly called "eternity," Cornelius maintained his rationally whimsical approach to the impossible task. <words>112</words> He arranged his oddities in perfect rows, each one a testament to some forgotten craft: a cobbler's last that remembered every foot it had measured, a telegraph key that still tapped out love letters to obsolete satellites, and of course, the pitcher. <words>156</words>

"To learn the true meaning of interconnectedness," he mused aloud with the theatrical gravity of a man selling snake oil to serpents, "one must first quantify the unquantifiable." <words>184</words> He withdrew his pocket watch—not to check time, which had no meaning here, but to swing it with the rhythm of a pendulum. <words>208</words> Back and forth, back and forth, each arc measuring the precise distance between everything and nothing. <words>225</words>

The rustic water pitcher began to glow, or perhaps it had always been glowing and the abyss had finally grown dark enough to notice. <words>250</words> Water that had never existed poured forth, creating rivers between realities, each drop a memory of rain on worlds that hadn't been invented yet. <words>275</words>

"You see," Cornelius explained to his absent audience with the mocking sincerity of a professor teaching philosophy to furniture, "the vanishing arts never truly vanish—they simply relocate to places where nobody thinks to look." <words>309</words> His pendulum-watch mapped the flow patterns while the pitcher continued its impossible work, stitching dimensions together with liquid thread. <words>328</words>

As repairs progressed, measured not in time but in the restoration of forgotten connections, Cornelius discovered that interconnectedness wasn't about understanding how things related to each other. <words>355</words> It was about accepting that everything was already the same thing, playing dress-up in different costumes. <words>372</words> The abyss wasn't silent because it lacked sound; it was silent because it contained all sounds simultaneously, canceling each other out in perfect, deafening harmony. <words>398</words>

When the last dimensional tear was mended with water that remembered being wine, Cornelius packed his oddities carefully. <words>416</words> The universe's fabric held firm once more, woven together by the lost art of believing in impossible things before breakfast. <words>437</words> He climbed out of the abyss, leaving only a business card that would never be read: "Cornelius Wicksworth: We Repair What Never Broke." <words>461</words>
