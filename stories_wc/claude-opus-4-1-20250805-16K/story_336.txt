The weary undertaker stood before the astronomical clock, its brass gears frozen mid-rotation like the moment after a car backfires on a silent street—that peculiar hush where time seems to fold into itself. <words>30</words> The ancient Persian palace had been reimagined as a morgue three centuries ago, but the clock remained, its celestial calculations etched in languages only the dead seemed to remember. <words>58</words>

Karim had inherited more than his father's burial tools; he'd inherited the tribal knowledge passed through seventeen generations of desert morticians, each keeper adding their observations to an oral tradition that was rarely practical in modern Tehran. <words>96</words> Yet tonight, as he prepared the body of the astronomer who'd died clutching star charts, the old stories stirred in his memory like sand disturbed by wind. <words>123</words>

The clock hadn't moved in fifty years, they said, but Karim noticed something his predecessors had missed—tiny perforations in the palace floor, marking where sunlight once traced paths through colored glass. <words>154</words> By following sun paths recorded in his grandfather's whispered teachings, he discovered that the morgue's placement was no accident; it aligned perfectly with the clock's frozen constellation. <words>182</words>

The astronomer's notes, which Karim read with the placid ferocity of a man seeking meaning in repetitive death, spoke of imprisoning light itself—not in bottles or boxes, but in the spaces between seconds. <words>215</words> "To hold onto hope in the absolute dark," the dead man had written, "one must first understand that darkness is merely light waiting to remember its purpose." <words>243</words>

Karim began his work differently that night, washing the body while reciting the celestial coordinates his forebears had memorized, their rarely practical wisdom suddenly crystallizing into purpose. <words>270</words> Each preparation ritual corresponded to a planetary movement; each prayer matched the clock's intended rhythm. <words>286</words>

As dawn approached, something shifted—not violently, but with the inevitable certainty of celestial mechanics. <words>300</words> The astronomical clock shuddered once, a sound like the universe clearing its throat, and began its ancient rotation. <words>318</words> Light poured through hidden apertures, following sun paths that hadn't been traced for generations, imprisoning shadows in geometric patterns across the floor. <words>340</words>

The undertaker understood then what his tribal knowledge had been preserving: not death rites, but a counting system for those who waited in darkness. <words>365</words> The clock wasn't measuring time—it was measuring the space between hope and surrender, calculating when the living needed reminding that even in the absolute dark of grief, celestial wheels still turned. <words>397</words>

Karim continued his preparations with renewed purpose, knowing that tomorrow another body would arrive, another family would grieve, and he would share what the clock had taught him: that some prisons are observatories, and some undertakers are astronomers of sorrow. <words>438</words> The palace morgue hummed with starlight, and the dead astronomer's face seemed, at last, at peace. <words>454</words>
