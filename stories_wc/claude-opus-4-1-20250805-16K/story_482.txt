The insomniac painter Morrow swayed on rope bridges between giant mushroom caps, her arboreal workshop creaking peacefully in the dawn breeze. <words>18</words> She hadn't slept for seven nights, not since discovering what lay behind the painted smiles adorning every canvas in her suspended studio. <words>39</words>

Her grandfather's tapered wizard's hat hung from a peg, its purple fabric marred by a single bullet hole near the brim. <words>60</words> He'd worn it the night he taught her to scry in puddles after midnight, reading futures in moonlit water. <words>79</words> "Art devours truth," he'd whispered then, "but truth devours the artist first." <words>91</words>

Now Morrow understood. <words>94</words> Each portrait she'd painted for the village below held trapped souls—peacefully chaotic essences writhing behind cheerful painted grins. <words>112</words> The mushroom spores had shown her this during last night's scrying session, when she'd crouched over a puddle on the workshop's main platform. <words>136</words>

She giggled, a sound tinged with frolicsome regret. <words>144</words> How naive she'd been, accepting commissions from the Mayor without question. <words>155</words> His "preservation project" wasn't preserving memories—it was devouring lives, one brushstroke at a time. <words>169</words>

The workshop swayed as morning mist rose from the forest floor far below. <words>182</words> In the village schoolhouse, she knew, empty classrooms would soon fill with children whose parents hung silent on her walls. <words>203</words> This was her final obstacle: finishing the Mayor's own portrait before he realized she knew. <words>218</words>

Morrow dipped her brush in paint mixed with tears and mushroom dust. <words>230</words> Behind the Mayor's commissioned smile, she would trap something different—not his soul, but his hunger itself. <words>247</words> Let him devour his own appetite for eternity. <words>255</words>

She painted through the morning hush, each stroke deliberate despite her exhaustion. <words>267</words> The bullet hole in grandfather's hat caught sunlight, reminding her why he'd fled this place decades ago. <words>284</words> He'd discovered the truth too late to save everyone, but early enough to save her—until she'd returned, thinking herself clever. <words>305</words>

The portrait neared completion as footsteps echoed on the spiral stairs carved into the mushroom's stem. <words>321</words> The Mayor climbed toward her workshop, eager to collect his masterpiece. <words>332</words>

Morrow added the final touch: a barely visible tear beneath his painted left eye. <words>346</words> When he touched the canvas, his essence would spiral inward, trapped by his own commissioned joy. <words>362</words>

"Is it ready?" he called from the landing. <words>370</words>

She turned the easel toward the door, exhausted but victorious. <words>380</words> "Come see your smile," she answered, watching him approach with greedy fingers extended. <words>393</words>

The workshop fell silent except for canvas crackling as it devoured its final meal. <words>407</words> Morrow collapsed beside grandfather's hat, finally able to sleep among the peacefully chaotic whispers of freed souls drifting upward like spores. <words>428</words>
