The hive-mind therapist adjusted her scuffed phone charger plug, watching it spark against the outlet in the secret agent training facility's observation room. <words>18</words> Dr. Vera Collective—as she preferred being called—possessed the uniformly peculiar ability to hear what she'd dubbed "the sound of hindsight": a crystalline chime that rang whenever someone realized their past mistakes. <words>49</words>

Tonight, she'd been summoned to drain Agent Morrison's paralyzing regret before tomorrow's mission. <words>63</words> The facility's director had discovered Morrison frozen in the combat simulator, tears streaming as hindsight's symphony overwhelmed him. <words>81</words>

"Tell me," Vera said, her thousand borrowed voices harmonizing with merry bitterness, "about the partner you lost in Prague." <words>100</words>

Morrison flinched. <words>102</words> Through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery—the location of the terrorist cell that killed his partner—he'd finally understood his fatal error. <words>128</words> "I should have trusted her instincts," he whispered. <words>136</words>

Vera lit a specialized candle, its wax engineered by the facility's lab. <words>148</words> "Watch the patterns," she instructed. <words>153</words>

Through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes on the metal table, Morrison's memories materialized: a spiral for doubt, parallel lines for the moment he'd overruled Sarah's warning, a star where she'd died. <words>188</words> The wax hardened instantly, preserving each regret in tangible form. <words>198</words>

"Your hindsight sings so loudly," Vera observed, her collective consciousness rippling with secondhand sorrow. <words>213</words> "But tomorrow's mission—you'll find them because of what you've learned, won't you?" <words>226</words>

Morrison touched the wax star. <words>231</words> "Sarah discovered their base. <words>235</words> She tried to tell me, but I insisted on following protocol." <words>246</words> The chime in Vera's mind crescendoed. <words>252</words>

"Then we must anchor the ephemeral in reality," Vera declared, producing a small vial. <words>266</words> "Your regret, once drained, becomes wisdom." <words>272</words> She began siphoning the emotional resonance from the wax shapes into the container, each pattern dissolving as Morrison's paralysis lifted. <words>292</words>

"Will I forget her?" he asked. <words>298</words>

"Never," Vera laughed, a sound like bitter honey. <words>306</words> "But you'll remember her triumph, not your failure. <words>314</words> The hindsight remains, transformed from a scream to a whisper—a teacher, not a tormentor." <words>328</words>

As dawn approached, Morrison stood straighter. <words>334</words> The wax had melted completely, leaving only faint impressions on the table's surface. <words>347</words> Vera's scuffed charger finally connected properly, flooding her collective neural network with power. <words>361</words>

"Go," she said, her voices converging into one. <words>369</words> "Sarah's discovery awaits its resolution." <words>374</words>

Morrison saluted and departed. <words>378</words> Alone, Vera listened to the fading chime of his hindsight, now harmonized with purpose. <words>392</words> Tomorrow, the terrorists would fall. <words>397</words> Tonight, she'd transformed an agent's greatest weakness into his sharpest weapon. <words>408</words> She smiled, pocketing her battered charger—her own anchor to reality amid the chaos of infinite minds. <words>425</words>
