Marcus pressed his palm against the observation deck's cold glass, watching Earth rotate below the lunar base. <words>14</words> The torn doormat corner he'd salvaged from his quarters lay beside him—the last fragment of his mother's handwoven welcome mat from their Martian colony home. <words>40</words>

He was a lukewarm mage, they'd called him at the Academy. <words>51</words> Not cold enough to freeze reality's edges, not hot enough to burn through dimensional barriers. <words>66</words> Just tepid, unremarkable, caught between states like the base's recycled air hovering between stale and fresh. <words>82</words>

But here, in the hush before someone opens a private journal, Marcus discovered his true gift. <words>98</words> The base's entertainment dome still held swirling stage fog from last night's performance, and through it, ephemeral silhouettes cast memories he could almost touch. <words>122</words>

His mother's shape flickered there, loyally peculiar in how she'd always stood slightly sideways when speaking, as if ready to dodge unseen dangers. <words>145</words> Marcus reached through the fog, his lukewarm magic finally finding purpose—not in grand gestures, but in clinging to echoes. <words>164</words>

"You can't keep doing this," Commander Chen said from the doorway. <words>175</words>

Marcus didn't turn. <words>178</words> "I'm trying to paint a future free from fear." <words>187</words>

"By living in the past?" <words>192</words>

The silhouettes began to clash, overlapping memories creating impossible conversations between people who'd never met. <words>207</words> His mother arguing with his younger self, his Academy instructor debating with Chen's grandmother—all pulled from the quantum residue that clung to objects touched by love. <words>234</words>

Marcus clutched the torn doormat corner tighter. <words>241</words> Each thread held a morning greeting, each fray a rushed goodbye. <words>252</words> His lukewarm magic couldn't resurrect the dead or alter time's flow, but it could preserve these moments in the fog, creating a library of shadows that future colonists might study. <words>282</words>

"The children born here," Marcus whispered, "they'll never know Earth's weight or Mars's rust-red dawns. <words>297</words> But they'll have these echoes to understand where their courage comes from." <words>309</words>

Chen stepped closer, her reflection joining the dance of silhouettes. <words>319</words> "And you? <words>321</words> When will you stop clinging and start living?" <words>329</words>

Marcus finally smiled, a charred serenity settling over his features like lunar dust after a meteorite strike. <words>346</words> "When I've captured enough echoes to prove that fear is just forgetting how many people loved us into being." <words>365</words>

He let the doormat corner fall, watching it disappear into the fog where it belonged—not lost, but transformed into another echo for tomorrow's children to discover. <words>391</words> The lukewarm mage had found his temperature at last: exactly warm enough to keep memories from freezing, exactly cool enough to prevent them from burning away. <words>417</words>
