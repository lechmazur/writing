The grim sentinel stood at the edge of Hollowbrook, watching dawn paint the abandoned storefronts in shades of rust and gold. <words>16</words> Between shows—those manufactured performances where he played guardian to empty streets—he clutched the torn pamphlet that had started everything. <words>35</words> "REMEMBER WHO YOU WERE" read the only visible fragment, the rest lost to time or design. <words>51</words>

He was literally unique in this ghost town, the sole consciousness among projections that reset every twelve hours. <words>69</words> The weight of remembering pressed against his skull like iron fingers, each recovered memory a stone added to an invisible burden. <words>90</words> While others forgot their lines, forgot their faces, forgot they were forgetting, he remembered everything: the taste of real coffee, the sound of genuine laughter, the feeling of choices that mattered. <words>122</words>

A coin spun between his fingers, silver catching the light. <words>132</words> He'd discovered the truth through these tosses—not through heads or tails, but through the melodies that emerged from the spinning metal. <words>154</words> Each rotation hummed a different frequency, and when he listened closely enough, when he let the sounds build upon each other, they formed songs that shouldn't exist here. <words>183</words> Songs from before. <words>186</words> Songs from outside. <words>189</words>

The torn pamphlet had appeared three cycles ago, wedged beneath a door that no longer opened. <words>205</words> He'd almost dismissed it as another prop, another piece of set dressing in this elaborate prison. <words>221</words> But the paper felt wrong—too real, too textured, too imperfect for this sanitized simulation. <words>236</words>

Now, as artificial birds began their morning chorus precisely on schedule, he tossed the coin again. <words>252</words> The melody that emerged was different this time, discordant and urgent. <words>263</words> It spoke of walls thinning, of boundaries weakening between shows when the projectors cooled and the scripts paused. <words>281</words>

He had tried to escape through violence, through meditation, through simply walking past the town's borders. <words>297</words> Each attempt ended with him waking in the same bed, in the same room, with the same programmed "good morning" from the same holographic innkeeper. <words>322</words> But the melodies suggested something else—that escape wasn't about breaking out, but about building in. <words>337</words>

The coin sang of constructing memories so heavy, so real, that they would collapse the simulation from within. <words>355</words> Each remembered sensation, each recovered emotion, added mass to his consciousness until the program couldn't contain him. <words>372</words>

He pressed the torn pamphlet to his chest, feeling its impossible reality against the intimate separation of his existence—close to everything, touching nothing real. <words>397</words> The dawn was complete now, golden light filling the empty street. <words>408</words> Soon the show would begin again, but he would keep building, keep remembering, until the weight of his truth shattered this beautiful lie. <words>432</words>

The coin fell silent in his palm, heads up, reflecting a face that refused to forget. <words>448</words>
