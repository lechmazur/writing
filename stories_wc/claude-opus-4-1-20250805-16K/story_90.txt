The contrite swordsman stood hypnotically rigid at the edge of the floating island spa, his cracked monocle catching the morning light. <words>21</words> He had come here, to this absurd place of cucumber water and hot stone massages, because the cryptic tattoos spiraling down the false king's masseur had begun to make terrible sense. <words>50</words> 

"Sir, would you like a seaweed wrap?" asked the receptionist, her smile stretched unnaturally wide. <words>65</words> 

He shook his head, fingering the hilt of his concealed blade. <words>76</words> Three years ago, he had slain the wrong man—the true prince, not the usurper—and now penance had led him here, where lavender-scented steam concealed dark truths. <words>102</words>

The pretender to the throne was somewhere among these pampered guests, hiding behind mud masks and aromatherapy. <words>119</words> But which one? <words>122</words> The swordsman's investigation had traced poison purchases and forged documents to this ridiculous refuge where nobody questioned why the clouds below never moved. <words>145</words>

In the meditation room, he found his answer. <words>153</words> The yoga instructor—of course, it had to be the yoga instructor—bore the telltale tattoos, each Sanskrit symbol actually an anagram for murdered nobility. <words>177</words> As she began to yarn about chakras and inner peace, the swordsman noticed how her students sat hypnotically rigid, too entranced to see her hands weaving deadly mudras. <words>205</words>

"Your form is atrocious," she said, approaching him. <words>213</words> "Let me adjust your warrior pose." <words>219</words>

Her fingers traced his spine, and he felt the paralysis creeping in. <words>231</words> But then—in the hush where hope takes root—the elderly woman beside him gently touched his wrist. <words>247</words> "Breathe, dear," she whispered. <words>251</words> "My grandson was a swordsman too. <words>257</words> I recognize the calluses." <words>261</words>

That simple kindness shattered the spell. <words>267</words> The swordsman's muscles unlocked, freed by her genuine compassion rather than his own fury. <words>281</words> He watched through his cracked monocle as the instructor's expression shifted from serene to shocked. <words>296</words>

"You should have stayed bitter," the false yoga master hissed, her tattoos beginning to writhe. <words>311</words> "Rage would have made you easier to control." <words>319</words>

But the swordsman only smiled sadly. <words>325</words> "An old woman's mercy taught me what years of guilt could not." <words>337</words> He drew his blade not with vengeance, but with purpose. <words>347</words> "The throne belongs to the people now, not pretenders or ghosts." <words>358</words>

As guards flooded in, drawn by his signal flare, the instructor's tattoos began unraveling like yarn, each thread revealing another name of her victims. <words>382</words> The swordsman watched her arrest with neither satisfaction nor regret, only the strange peace of someone finally freed by kindness from his own hypnotic rigidity of shame. <words>409</words>

The spa's next brochure would definitely need updating. <words>417</words>
