Marcus sat in the abandoned hospital waiting area, his laptop screen casting blue shadows across rows of empty chairs that hadn't held patients in decades. <words>19</words> The virtual call connected, showing his handler's pixelated face, but Marcus barely listened, rolling the plain wooden bead between his fingers—the only inheritance from his grandmother, a nurse who'd worked here during the last war. <words>56</words>

"The embassy bombing changes nothing," the handler droned, but Marcus knew better. <words>69</words> Each conflict left invisible scars, distortions in society's fabric that only someone trained in the ancient art of pattern-reading could detect. <words>91</words> His grandmother had taught him fragments before she died, whispering about warriors who tracked evil through reflections, through the bent light of truth. <words>115</words>

He positioned his laptop to capture the antique funhouse mirror propped against the far wall—salvaged from the pediatric wing, its warped surface still decorated with faded circus animals. <words>143</words> Through the video feed, he watched his handler's image multiply and twist in the mirror's curves behind him. <words>161</words> The distortions revealed what direct observation couldn't: micro-expressions stretched into truth, the subtle flinch when discussing civilian casualties, the imperceptible tightening around the eyes. <words>185</words>

"Your performance has been exemplary," the handler continued, attempting to flatter him into accepting another assassination. <words>201</words> But Marcus saw through the mirror how the man's mouth curved wrong, how his shoulders betrayed the lie. <words>219</words>

Years of operating as a vigilante had taught Marcus to move with artfully clumsy precision—appearing incompetent while achieving surgical results. <words>239</words> He'd eliminated seventeen war profiteers this way, each death seeming accidental, each target chosen through the mirror's revelations. <words>257</words> The bead grew warm in his palm, a compass pointing toward justice in a world where governments had abandoned it. <words>277</words>

"I need time to consider," Marcus said, his voice subdued, almost apologetic. <words>289</words> The handler nodded, satisfied with what he interpreted as weakness. <words>299</words>

After disconnecting, Marcus remained in the screaming silence of the waiting area, studying the mirror's surface. <words>315</words> Each ripple in the old glass held a memory of children who'd laughed at their silly reflections, before bombs fell, before their hospitals became tombs. <words>340</words> The price of war wasn't measured in money or territory, but in these abandoned spaces where joy once lived. <words>359</words>

He opened his grandmother's journal, comparing her sketches of reflection patterns to what he'd observed. <words>374</words> The ancient art demanded patience, sacrifice, and the willingness to see truth in distortion. <words>388</words> Tomorrow, another virtual call would come, another mission offered. <words>397</words> But tonight, Marcus would practice reading the mirror's prophecies, preparing to hunt those who profited from humanity's suffering. <words>414</words> The wooden bead clicked against his wedding ring—another casualty of his chosen path—as he began mapping the handler's lies into patterns of vengeance. <words>438</words>

Justice, he'd learned, was simply war by other means. <words>447</words>
