Marcus Bloom arrived at the paper airplane test facility at 6:59 AM sharp, as he had every morning throughout his volunteering stint—the vigilant orchardist was pathologically incapable of being tardy, even when investigating murder. <words>30</words> His daughter had died six months ago in what authorities called a "freak pesticide accident" at their family orchard, but Marcus knew better. <words>52</words> The facility's director, Dr. Havens, greeted him with the same plastic smile she'd worn since day one, unaware that Marcus had discovered her antique letter seal pressed into classified documents linking agricultural corporations to weaponized aerosol research. <words>87</words> "Another productive day ahead!" she chirped, and Marcus matched her enthusiasm with his own brand of sardonic glee, knowing that today he would finally demonstrate the truth. <words>114</words>

Throughout his volunteering, he'd catalogued every paper airplane's flight pattern, noting how certain designs dispersed invisible particles in configurations identical to those found at contaminated orchards nationwide. <words>140</words> The breakthrough came when he recognized the dispersal patterns matched the eye-spots on a peacock's tail—nature's perfect spiral geometry, weaponized for maximum agricultural devastation. <words>165</words> "Dr. Havens," Marcus announced during the morning briefing, producing her seal from his pocket, "I've been wondering why your personal correspondence appears on Project Iridescence documents." <words>192</words> Her smile faltered as he unfolded a paper airplane, one he'd modified to reveal UV-reactive powder when launched. <words>210</words>

"You see," he continued, launching the plane with theatrical precision, "peacock tail patterns aren't just beautiful—they're the optimal configuration for toxin dispersal across orchards." <words>233</words> The plane arced through the air, leaving a glowing spiral that perfectly matched the death pattern in his daughter's lungs. <words>253</words> "Funny how a fruit farmer notices things," he said, savoring her growing panic. <words>266</words> "Like how your 'agricultural efficiency program' tested its prototypes exactly where independent orchardists refused to sell to AgroCorp." <words>283</words>

The other volunteers gasped as Marcus produced months of meticulously documented evidence, each paper airplane test correlated with mysterious orchard failures. <words>304</words> "My daughter was never late either," he said, voice dripping with dark satisfaction. <words>318</words> "She was in the orchard at dawn, right when your morning test flights drifted over our property line." <words>337</words> Security rushed in, but Marcus had already uploaded everything to WikiLeaks from the facility's own servers—he'd learned their passwords weeks ago, written carelessly on paper airplanes that never made it to the shredder. <words>370</words>

Dr. Havens crumpled like badly folded origami as FBI agents, whom Marcus had contacted that morning, filed in with warrants. <words>390</words> "You killed her for profit margins," Marcus whispered, his sardonic glee finally giving way to grief. <words>407</words> "But at least you were punctual about it." <words>415</words> As they led her away, Marcus picked up one last paper airplane, folding it into the shape of a dove—his daughter's favorite bird. <words>439</words> The conspiracy was unraveled, but no amount of justice would bring her back. <words>452</words> Still, watching Havens in handcuffs, Marcus felt his first genuine smile in six months. <words>467</words> Sometimes vengeance flew as true as a well-folded plane. <words>476</words>
