The asteroid's gravity pulled gently at Kira's boots as she drifted through the abandoned pirate hideout, her empathic senses drowsily buzzing with the residual emotions that haunted these metallic corridors. <words>26</words> The dried starfish in her pocket—a relic from Earth's dead oceans—pressed against her ribs, its five arms pointing toward something obviously hidden in plain sight: the truth about why pirates had fled this place. <words>60</words> She'd come here to marshal the fragments of understanding, to champion the outcasts of reason who'd been dismissed as mad when they spoke of hearing the asteroid itself whispering ancient mountain wisdom through the vacuum. <words>93</words>

In what had once been the captain's quarters, she discovered it—a shattered marionette floating in pieces, each fragment inscribed with symbols that made her temples throb with someone else's memories. <words>122</words> As her fingers brushed the first piece, she understood: this wasn't just a puppet, but a vessel for the consciousness of the asteroid's original inhabitant, a being older than human spaceflight who'd tried to communicate through the pirates' dreams. <words>162</words>

With drowsy enthusiasm born from exhaustion and wonder, Kira began reassembling the marionette, each connection sparking visions of stone-deep patience and geological time. <words>185</words> The pirates had broken it in fear, unable to comprehend that the asteroid itself was alive, teaching through stillness what Earth's mountains had once known. <words>210</words> String by string, joint by joint, she worked while the dried starfish grew warm against her chest, resonating with frequencies only an empath could feel. <words>235</words>

The forgotten journal lay open on the captain's desk, its closing page half-written: "The puppet speaks of waiting, of watching civilizations rise and fall like tides—" <words>261</words> The entry ended there, but Kira understood what terror had silenced. <words>272</words> She was reconstructing not just a marionette but a bridge between the reasonable and the impossible, between human logic and cosmic patience. <words>294</words>

As the final piece clicked into place, the marionette's carved eyes opened, and through it spoke the asteroid's consciousness with the unhurried cadence of erosion shaping cliffsides. <words>321</words> "You came," it said, and Kira felt the weight of centuries in those two words. <words>336</words> "The others fled when they couldn't catalogue my existence in their ledgers of plunder." <words>350</words>

She smiled, her introverted nature finding comfort in this communion with something so profoundly patient. <words>365</words> "I came to listen," she whispered, holding the dried starfish up to the porthole where distant stars flickered like bioluminescent plankton in an infinite sea. <words>389</words> The marionette's wooden fingers moved in deliberate gestures, teaching her the mountain wisdom of endurance, of being simultaneously obviously hidden—visible yet unseen by those who refused to truly look. <words>419</words> Here, in this forgotten hideout, the outcasts of reason had found their champion, and she had found her purpose in the slow, eternal dance between stone and stars. <words>448</words>
