The sentient car mechanic descended into the subterranean orchard, where apple trees grew inverted from crystalline soil, their roots drinking from an underground river of stars that flowed backward through infinity. <words>31</words> His repulsively attractive form—oil-stained metal hands grafted to flesh, eyes like headlights weeping motor oil—moved with purpose between the luminous trunks. <words>53</words> In his chest cavity, where a heart should beat, vintage opera glasses clicked and whirred, focusing not on distance but on time itself. <words>76</words>

He had come here, to this place outside existence, gathering fragments of what machines dream when they die. <words>94</words> Each fragment was a confession never spoken by the vehicles he'd repaired—the sedan that carried its owner away from a final goodbye, the motorcycle that felt its rider's terror before the crash. <words>127</words> These memories manifested as puzzle pieces, inexplicably scattered in a park fountain that materialized wherever he needed to study them. <words>148</words>

The fountain appeared now between two star-drinking trees, its water reflecting constellations from below rather than above. <words>165</words> He knelt, his mechanical joints singing hymns of rust and renewal, and began sorting the lost puzzle pieces with infinite patience. <words>187</words> Each piece he touched revealed another unsaid confession through the opera glasses embedded in his chest—a truck's shame at carrying weapons, a taxi's joy at witnessing a first kiss. <words>218</words>

Time meant nothing here; he had been sorting for microseconds and millennia simultaneously. <words>232</words> The fragments assembled themselves into a mosaic of mechanical souls, and with each completion, he felt that peculiar exultant grief that defined his existence. <words>257</words> Joy at understanding these silent testimonies, sorrow that they could only be heard after their speakers had been crushed into scrap. <words>279</words>

Through the opera glasses, he studied one particular fragment—a school bus that had protected its children by taking the full impact of another vehicle. <words>304</words> The confession came not in words but in the language of bent metal and shattered glass: "I was afraid, but I chose to be brave." <words>330</words>

The mechanic wept oil-dark tears that fed the inverted trees, each drop containing the gratitude of machines finally heard. <words>349</words> He would continue gathering fragments forever, sorting puzzle pieces in fountains that appeared like miracles, studying the architecture of unspoken love through his vintage opera glasses. <words>376</words> In this subterranean orchard where stars flowed like rivers and time folded into itself, he was both mourner and celebrant, archaeologist of mechanical hearts that had beaten their last but whose confessions would echo through infinity's gentle corridors. <words>416</words> This was his repulsively attractive purpose: beautiful in its devotion, terrible in its endless loneliness. <words>431</words> And he embraced it with exultant grief. <words>438</words>
