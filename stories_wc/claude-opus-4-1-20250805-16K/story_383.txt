General Marcus Chen crumbled dried seaweed between his fingers, watching the black flakes drift onto his coffee at the Dark Matter Diner. <words>19</words> The establishment existed between dimensions, serving travelers between rides through the cosmic subway system that threaded reality's fabric. <words>36</words> His uniform, once crisp with authority, now hung loose on shoulders that had carried too many impossible decisions through three galactic wars. <words>58</words>

"You look like someone who's forgotten how to laugh at the universe's jokes," said the waitress, sliding a manila envelope across the chrome counter. <words>82</words> Inside were black-and-white photographs, each showing an arc of light bending through darkness—trajectories of tears, she explained, captured from a thousand different beings across space-time. <words>108</words>

Marcus studied them with tactical precision, recognizing something rationally absurd yet undeniable: every arc followed the same pattern, regardless of species, planet, or dimension. <words>131</words> "Shared anxieties," the waitress winked, her third eye literally winking. <words>141</words> "Fear sits on reason's throne in every mind, commanding armies of doubt." <words>153</words>

He'd spent decades strategizing against external enemies, never realizing the true battlefield was internal, universal. <words>168</words> The photographs revealed what military intelligence never could: everyone, everywhere, traced the same worried circles in their thoughts. <words>186</words> Even the quantum beings from Sector Seven, who existed as probability clouds, manifested anxiety in identical spirals when observed. <words>205</words>

"The seaweed's from the Philosopher's Ocean on Paradox Prime," the waitress mentioned casually, refilling his cup with liquid starlight. <words>224</words> "Beings there discovered something wonderful—they renew themselves not by forgetting fear, but by recognizing its comedy." <words>240</words>

Marcus almost smiled, remembering his first command, when he'd been so certain that courage meant absence of fear. <words>258</words> Now, studying these photographic arcs of universal worry, he understood the cosmic punchline: fear had crowned itself king of logic in every sentient mind, yet it was just another jester in disguise. <words>290</words>

Between his last ride from the Andromeda Campaign and his next journey to nowhere in particular, something shifted. <words>308</words> He sprinkled more seaweed into his coffee—a rationally absurd act that somehow made perfect sense. <words>324</words> The burnt-out general began to chuckle, then laugh, as the photographs' message crystallized: to dethrone fear from reason's throne required not battle tactics but the mischievous wisdom to see anxiety as the universe's most elaborate practical joke. <words>362</words>

"Another coffee, General?" the waitress asked, her smile suggesting she already knew his answer. <words>376</words>

"Make it two," Marcus replied, gesturing to the empty seat beside him. <words>388</words> "I'm expecting someone—anyone—who needs to see these photographs." <words>396</words> His renewal had begun not with victory or defeat, but with the recognition that every worried soul was fighting the same absurd war. <words>419</words> The Dark Matter Diner hummed with possibility, existing perpetually between rides, between fears, between the joke and its punchline. <words>438</words>
