The lone trapper floated through the observatory's corroded halls, her boots magnetized to rust-eaten grating that hummed with each step—silently audible vibrations only she could feel through worn rubber soles. <words>28</words>

Between shifts, when the station's skeleton crew slept, she haunted these abandoned sections like a ghost mining memories. <words>46</words>

Her fingers found the piece of sea glass in her pocket, worn smooth by an ocean that existed three hundred miles below. <words>68</words>

She'd discovered it yesterday while decoding microfilm from shady archives—those black-market data caches that observatory workers traded for extra oxygen rations. <words>89</words>

The film had contained her daughter's last transmission before the hull breach on Mining Platform Seven. <words>105</words>

"Mama, I found something beautiful today." <words>111</words>

That was all. <words>114</words>

The rest had dissolved into static, but attached was a single coordinate: storage locker 9-B in the abandoned research wing. <words>134</words>

Inside, wrapped in her daughter's favorite scarf, lay this fragment of Earth—impossible, precious, real. <words>148</words>

The trapper knew she needed to recommence her rounds soon; the morning shift supervisor would notice her absence. <words>166</words>

But here, in this liminal space between duty and grief, she could hold both the glass and the possibility it represented. <words>187</words>

Her daughter had smuggled beauty into the void, had understood what the company psychologists never could: that loss wasn't just subtraction. <words>208</words>

It was transformation. <words>211</words>

The sea glass caught the faint emergency lighting, throwing green shadows that danced like aurora borealis across the walls. <words>229</words>

She thought of her daughter's laugh—how it had filled these metal corridors with warmth that no amount of recycled air could replicate. <words>251</words>

Gone now, yes, but somehow more present in its absence, like dark matter exerting invisible pull. <words>267</words>

The trapper had come to this floating tomb to siphon radiance from a black hole of doubt—doubt that anything remained after loss except emptiness. <words>291</words>

But her daughter had left breadcrumbs of wonder: the microfilm, the coordinates, this piece of home worn smooth by impossible waters. <words>312</words>

She pressed the glass against her cheek, feeling its coolness through her weathered skin. <words>326</words>

The observatory creaked around her, a whale song of metal fatigue and cosmic pressure, but she heard her daughter's voice beneath it all: "Beautiful things find their way, Mama." <words>355</words>

The morning klaxon would sound soon, calling her back to checking trap lines for space debris, collecting the universe's cast-offs for salvage. <words>377</words>

But she'd carry this secret lighthouse with her now—proof that even in the sterile dark between stars, love could leave artifacts that transformed sorrow into something luminous, something worth continuing for. <words>408</words>

She pocketed the sea glass and walked back toward the inhabited sections, her step lighter despite the artificial gravity, carrying her daughter's last gift like captured starlight against her hip. <words>438</words>
