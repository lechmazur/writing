The somber troubadour arrived at the abandoned rocket launch site as dawn painted rust across the corroded gantries. <words>15</words> His fingers traced the tarnished silver ring he'd inherited from his grandmother, its surface worn smooth by generations of worried rubbing. <words>35</words> This was where his family's curse had begun—where his great-grandfather had sabotaged the maiden voyage, believing progress would torpedo humanity's soul. <words>57</words>

For three generations, his bloodline had carried the weight of that betrayal, each descendant marked by an inability to feel others' joy or pain. <words>82</words> They lived as emotional islands, watching life through frosted glass. <words>92</words> But Marcus had discovered something steadily unpredictable in his grandmother's attic: vintage tablecloths embroidered with cryptic stanzas that mapped the arc of empathy itself. <words>116</words>

The verses spoke of returning to the origin point during a period of profound transformation. <words>131</words> Tonight, the comet his great-grandfather had feared would return—the same celestial body the rocket was meant to study. <words>150</words> Marcus spread the first tablecloth across the launch pad's cracked concrete, its golden threads catching moonlight. <words>167</words>

"Where metal birds once kissed the sky," he sang softly, his voice echoing through empty fuel tanks, "there waits the door to feel and cry." <words>193</words> The ring grew warm against his chest. <words>200</words> Each tablecloth revealed another verse, another step in undoing what his ancestor had wrought. <words>214</words>

As he worked through the night, laying out the embroidered prophecies in careful patterns, something shifted in the air. <words>233</words> The abandoned site began to hum with possibility. <words>241</words> Control panels flickered to life, displaying not technical data but human stories—moments of grief, ecstasy, love, loss. <words>258</words>

The final stanza required him to stand where the rocket once waited, to sing the words that would complete the circuit. <words>279</words> His voice, usually heavy with inherited sorrow, lifted with hushed euphoria as understanding dawned. <words>293</words> The curse wasn't punishment—it was protection, misguided but born from love. <words>304</words> His great-grandfather had tried to shield his descendants from feeling too deeply in a world he believed would burn. <words>323</words>

As the comet blazed overhead, Marcus felt the first tear he'd ever shed for someone else's pain. <words>340</words> Then came laughter for a stranger's joy glimpsed in the ghostly displays. <words>352</words> The ring crumbled to dust, its purpose finally complete. <words>361</words> Around him, the launch site transformed, not into what it was, but what it could have been—a monument to human ambition tempered by wisdom. <words>386</words> Marcus understood now that empathy wasn't a burden to torpedo our dreams, but the fuel that made them worth pursuing. <words>406</words> He gathered the tablecloths, their prophecy fulfilled, ready to walk back into a world he could finally, truly feel. <words>425</words>
