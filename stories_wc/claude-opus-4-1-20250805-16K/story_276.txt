The orbital debris tracking station lurched against its moorings, sending Ambassador Chen's coffee spilling across the console. <words>15</words> She steadied herself with a thin coathanger she'd been using to retrieve a fallen keycard from behind the equipment rack. <words>34</words> Through the porthole, Earth's curve glowed beneath a constellation of tracked objects—each one a mistake humanity had left spinning in the dark. <words>57</words>

Chen was an uneasy emissary, sent here not by choice but by court order after the diplomatic incident on Mars. <words>78</words> Her punishment: six months monitoring space junk while teaching orbital mechanics to visiting school groups via hologram. <words>95</words> Yet in this exile, she'd discovered something unexpected. <words>103</words>

The station's break room held relics from previous operators—particularly postcards pinned to the ancient fridge door, their edges worn soft. <words>123</words> Through the rustle of postcards pinned to a fridge door whenever the ventilation kicked on, she heard whispers of redemption stories. <words>145</words> One showed a cherry tree split by lightning that had grown two crowns; another depicted a beach where plastic waste had been transformed into reef structures. <words>172</words> Each image spoke of branches of redemption—how broken things could become something new. <words>186</words>

Throughout picnics with the virtual students on simulated grass, Chen found herself drawing consistently surprising parallels. <words>202</words> "See that defunct satellite?" she'd point through the display. <words>211</words> "It's like a mistake you made last year—still orbiting your life, but getting smaller in the rearview." <words>229</words> The children would laugh, but she saw understanding bloom in their eyes. <words>241</words>

Her morning routine became meditation: tracking debris patterns while the coathanger conducted her movements like a maestro's baton, plotting trajectories that reminded her of bird migrations. <words>266</words> She began to learn universal patterns in the chaos—how objects in decay could shepherd others into safer orbits, how collisions sometimes cleared paths rather than cluttering them. <words>294</words>

One Tuesday, a student asked why she seemed happy in such a lonely place. <words>308</words> Chen paused, realizing she'd been humming. <words>314</words> "Sometimes," she said, watching a derelict solar panel tumble past, catching sunlight like a prayer wheel, "you have to be removed from everything to see how everything connects." <words>343</words>

The accidental wisdom felt strange on her tongue—she who had once spoken only in diplomatic protocols and careful lies. <words>363</words> But here, among the orphaned machines and failed missions, she'd found an honest language. <words>378</words> Each piece of debris carried its story of ambition and abandonment, yet continued its faithful orbit, patient as a saint. <words>399</words>

When her sentence ended, Chen requested an extension. <words>407</words> The review board, consistently surprised by her transformation, granted it immediately. <words>418</words> She remained at the station, no longer an uneasy emissary but a keeper of broken things, teaching children that failure was just another kind of beginning, spinning endlessly toward home. <words>449</words>
