Esmeralda's fingers traced the lock mechanism with practiced indifference, her years as the colonial town's locksmith having dulled any wonder at the secrets people kept. <words>19</words> Above her workshop, the labyrinth orchard sprawled across interconnected rooftops, its twisted apple trees forming maze-like passages where the old families once practiced their forbidden hunts. <words>45</words> She'd discovered the entrance three years ago while painting her shop's weathered sign, when a stray brushstroke revealed ancient keyhole patterns beneath the plaster. <words>69</words>

The unclaimed throne of the orchard's heart had waited empty for generations, its rightful heir lost to revolution and time. <words>89</words> Only those who understood the traditional hunting methods—stalking prey through branch and shadow—could claim it, but such knowledge had nearly vanished. <words>111</words> Esmeralda possessed this knowledge, inherited through her grandmother's embroidered gloves, their silk threads mapping each hunting route in delightfully menacing detail: wolves devouring hearts, arrows piercing moons. <words>138</words>

She'd worn those gloves to pottery class last Tuesday, hoping their patterns might inspire her clay work. <words>156</words> Instead, she'd encountered Marcus, whose casual mention of "crown locks" made her blood freeze. <words>171</words> He'd shaped his clay with movements that mirrored the old hunting gestures perfectly, his hands dancing the forgotten steps of approach and capture. <words>195</words> Their eyes had met across the spinning wheels, and she'd seen her own guarded recognition reflected back. <words>213</words>

"You know about the throne," she'd said, her voice carrying demure audacity. <words>226</words> He'd merely smiled, continuing to shape what she now recognized as a ceremonial hunting horn. <words>242</words>

Tonight, as twilight began to permeate the rooftop maze with purple shadows, they climbed together through her workshop's hidden panel. <words>263</words> Marcus moved with the fluid grace of someone who'd learned the old ways not from gloves but from living memory. <words>284</words> "My grandfather was the keeper," he admitted as they navigated the gnarled passages. <words>298</words> "He taught me everything before the families scattered." <words>306</words>

The throne appeared before them like a secret breathing itself into existence: carved from a living tree, its roots and branches forming an elaborate seat. <words>332</words> Esmeralda pulled out her grandmother's gloves, their embroidery glowing faintly in the dying light. <words>347</words> "These patterns," she said, "they're not just hunting routes." <words>357</words> "They're the coronation ritual," Marcus finished, his expression both solemn and eager. <words>369</words>

Together, they began the ancient dance around the throne, their movements preserving what others had tried to forget. <words>388</words> The orchard seemed to pulse with approval as they wove between trees, hunter and keeper, locksmith and heir. <words>407</words> Neither would claim the throne tonight—that required the full council of families—but they would ensure the traditions survived. <words>426</words> In the colonial town below, no one suspected that above their sleeping heads, the old ways were stirring back to life. <words>448</words> Some locks, Esmeralda thought with satisfaction, were meant to be opened. <words>459</words>
