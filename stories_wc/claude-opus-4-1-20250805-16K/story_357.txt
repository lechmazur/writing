Margaret had spent seventeen years collecting depression metaphors, but the black rose pinned in her journal remained her favorite—wilted, preserved, perfect. <words>19</words> The frost giant's lair wasn't the obvious venue for a board game night, but then again, Margaret was seldom odd about her choices. <words>40</words> She'd received the invitation yesterday, slipped under her apartment door like a dare: "Come play Monopoly with mythological beings—we need a fourth." <words>63</words>

"Delightful," she'd muttered, recognizing immediately that this wasn't about real estate. <words>74</words>

The lair sparkled with impossible ice formations, each surface reflecting her focused collector's eye as she arranged her pewter tokens. <words>94</words> Across from her, the frost giant rolled dice the size of skulls while a phoenix preened and a sphinx yawned. <words>114</words> They were playing, she realized, for something more precious than paper money. <words>126</words>

"Your turn, mortal," rumbled the giant, passing her the dice with surprising gentleness. <words>139</words>

Margaret had named her despair "Alpha" years ago—such a pompous title for something that hunted her through empty rooms. <words>158</words> Now, watching her thimble hop past Boardwalk, she felt Alpha circling the table like smoke. <words>173</words>

"You're awfully quiet for someone winning," observed the phoenix, its voice crackling like expensive firewood. <words>188</words>

"I find solitude chatty enough," Margaret replied, buying another railroad with theatrical precision. <words>201</words> The truth was beginning to unravel: this game wasn't random. <words>211</words> Each property she acquired stripped away another layer of Alpha's camouflage. <words>222</words>

Round after round, the board transformed into her life's map—every hotel a fortress she'd built against connection, every monopoly a wall. <words>244</words> The sphinx spoke only once, between turns: "Loneliness and solitude aren't twins, you know." <words>258</words>

"Obviously," Margaret shot back, though her fingers trembled as she moved past GO. <words>271</words> "One's a choice, the other's a stalker." <words>278</words>

The frost giant laughed, shaking icicles from the ceiling. <words>287</words> "Then why do you feed them both?" <words>294</words>

By the final round, Margaret understood. <words>300</words> The black rose in her journal wasn't a trophy—it was bait she'd been carrying for Alpha. <words>317</words> Every beautiful, broken thing she'd collected had been breadcrumbs leading her predator home. <words>330</words>

"I fold," she announced suddenly, scattering her paper fortune. <words>339</words>

"You can't fold in Monopoly!" protested the phoenix. <words>347</words>

"Watch me," Margaret grinned, standing up. <words>353</words> "I'm embracing something better than winning." <words>359</words>

She left the lair with empty pockets and full lungs, having discovered that triumph over despair meant refusing to play its rigged game. <words>382</words> The black rose remained pinned in her journal, but now it marked the page where she'd written: "Solitude chose me back." <words>403</words> Alpha, that ancient predator, starved to death on her earnest flippancy. <words>414</words> Sometimes the only way to win is to stop keeping score. <words>425</words>
