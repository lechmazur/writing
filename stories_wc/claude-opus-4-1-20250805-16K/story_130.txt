The interstellar orchard ship's gravity wheels groaned like old bones, spinning their eternal harvest between dead galaxies. <words>15</words> Kira, the lost apprentice who'd stowed away three migrations ago, cradled the fallen bird's nest she'd found wedged beneath the oxygen recyclers. <words>37</words> Real birds hadn't existed on the ship for centuries, yet someone had painstakingly woven synthetic fibers into this perfect replica—a monument to memory. <words>60</words>

"Still talking to ghosts, little stray?" <words>66</words> Captain Ynes's voice crackled through the ancient cordless phone Kira kept pressed to her ear. <words>81</words> The device hadn't worked since Earth, but its static-laden silence had become her confessional booth, where she pretended someone listened. <words>101</words>

"I'm reverse-engineering their wisdom," Kira shot back, her tone carrying that mocking affection reserved for mentors who'd abandoned you but left their lessons behind. <words>125</words> She traced the nest's intricate weave, understanding dawning like artificial sunrise through the viewports. <words>139</words> Each twisted strand represented a choice, a journey, a small rebellion against the void. <words>153</words>

Ynes chuckled, a sound like solar wind through hull breaches. <words>163</words> "The travelers who built that nest knew something you're still learning—being lost isn't about location." <words>178</words>

Kira had been privately open about her situation for months now, admitting her fears only to the static, to the vast nothing between stars. <words>202</words> She'd run from her apprenticeship in the engine rooms, unable to accept that her hands shook when precision mattered most. <words>222</words> The other engineers called it "stellar palsy," common among those born during galactic transitions, but knowing didn't ease the shame. <words>242</words>

"The nest fell because it was meant to," she whispered into the dead phone, watching synthetic apple blossoms drift past the observation deck. <words>265</words> "Just like I fell from my predetermined path." <words>273</words>

The ship's migration route bent across the promise of changing winds—solar currents that would carry them to virgin galaxies where different rules might apply. <words>297</words> Kira had thought freedom meant escaping her failed apprenticeship, but the nest's patient architecture suggested otherwise. <words>313</words> Every imperfect weave, every asymmetrical curve, had been deliberately chosen. <words>322</words>

"You still there, Captain?" <words>326</words> she asked, knowing the answer. <words>331</words> Ynes had died two migrations ago, but her wisdom lived in the static, in the spaces between words. <words>349</words> The old phone was just a prop for the conversation Kira needed to have with herself. <words>365</words>

She tucked the nest into her jacket, feeling its fragile weight against her trembling hands. <words>380</words> Tomorrow, she'd return to the engine rooms—not as the perfect apprentice she'd tried to be, but as the flawed navigator she was becoming. <words>404</words> The orchard ship needed someone who understood that wisdom comes from accepting the fall, from building something beautiful despite shaking hands. <words>425</words>

"Thanks for listening," she told the static, smiling with genuine affection at her own elaborate self-deception. <words>441</words> After all, the best teachers were the ones you carried within yourself. <words>453</words>
