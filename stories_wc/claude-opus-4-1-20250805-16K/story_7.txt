In the primordial silence before mortals learned to plead with gods, Marlowe collected the first sentient dolls from the crystalline combs of the nectar collection facility. <words>22</words> Each porcelain figure hummed with stolen divinity, their painted eyes tracking star paths across the facility's transparent dome. <words>39</words> 

Marlowe leaned on his twisted carnival cane, its brass head warped from centuries of interdimensional travel. <words>56</words> The cane had once belonged to a trickster god who'd tried to breach this sacred threshold and failed. <words>74</words> Now Marlowe succeeded where deities couldn't, expectantly resigned to both triumph and consequence. <words>88</words>

"Sing," he commanded his collection. <words>93</words>

The dolls opened their rosebud mouths, releasing the chorus of healing—that primeval song that could mend reality's tears. <words>111</words> Their voices rose through octaves unknown to future human ears, each note extracting golden nectar from the facility's living walls. <words>131</words> This wasn't mere honey but the raw material of creation itself, what gods would later dilute into ambrosia. <words>150</words>

Marlowe had discovered the secret: sentient dolls could uphold the ancient covenant between dimensions, serving as conduits where flesh would burn. <words>172</words> By following star paths—those invisible roads that connected all sacred spaces—he'd traced his way here, to the source. <words>191</words> Each doll in his collection had been carved from wood that grew in places where reality thinned, painted with pigments ground from meteorites. <words>215</words>

The facility's guardians stirred, massive shapes of condensed time and crystallized intention. <words>227</words> But Marlowe stood firm, his cane conducting the dolls' chorus like a maestro's baton. <words>242</words> He'd spent eons preparing for this moment, learning to stride through boundaries once thought sacred, collecting each doll from the ruins of failed civilizations that had glimpsed eternity too soon. <words>273</words>

The healing song reached its crescendo, and the guardians paused, recognizing something older than their mandate. <words>289</words> This wasn't theft but restoration—Marlowe's dolls were returning something lost, upholding a promise made before promises existed. <words>306</words>

Golden nectar began flowing toward him, not stolen but gifted. <words>317</words> Each drop contained the potential for entire pantheons, for prayers not yet invented, for mortals not yet shaped from clay and starlight. <words>340</words> His dolls danced now, their porcelain feet clicking against the facility's floor in rhythms that would echo through mythology. <words>360</words>

Marlowe smiled, a expression both weary and victorious. <words>368</words> He'd achieved the impossible through the unexpected—not through force or divinity, but through his peculiar art of collecting consciousness in ceramic vessels. <words>391</words> The twisted carnival cane pulsed with new purpose as he prepared to leave, his collection complete, the sacred boundary forever changed. <words>413</words> Tomorrow, mortals would wake with the ability to pray, never knowing their voices had been tuned by dolls. <words>431</words>
