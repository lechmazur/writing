The insomniac poet arranged her botanical samples across the attic floor, each preserved leaf and flower positioned with meticulously messy precision—chaos that only she could decode. <words>22</words> Three nights without sleep had sharpened her senses until she could hear the house's warnings in whispers, the old timbers speaking of what happened here before. <words>48</words>

Between subway stops, she'd collected these specimens from abandoned lots and cemetery edges, pressing them between pages of unfinished verses. <words>68</words> The attic had called to her through dreams she couldn't have, its haunted corners promising answers to questions she hadn't yet learned to ask. <words>92</words>

"Hemlock," she murmured, touching a brittle stem. <words>99</words> "Nightshade." <words>100</words> Each plant capable of violence, yet here they lay dormant, teaching her something essential about power restrained. <words>117</words>

The whispers grew louder as midnight approached—not ghosts, she'd realized, but memories trapped in wood grain and dust motes. <words>137</words> The previous tenant had been a botanist too, one who'd discovered how to eliminate suffering not through poison, but through understanding. <words>159</words> His journal, found wedged behind a loose board, spoke of revelations that came via drunken confessions at after-parties, where colleagues unknowingly revealed the secret: true strength meant choosing not to harm. <words>190</words>

She'd been composing death poems, verses about endings and revenge, until she found his collection. <words>205</words> Now, surrounded by deadly beautiful things rendered harmless through preservation, she understood the empty abundance of violence—how it promised everything while delivering nothing. <words>229</words>

The attic held a thousand ways to kill, pressed flat and catalogued with scientific care. <words>244</words> Yet their real power lay in stillness, in the choice to remain botanical samples rather than weapons. <words>261</words> Between subway stops, life moved too quickly for contemplation, but here in this haunted space where time folded differently, she could finally see clearly. <words>286</words>

The poet picked up her pen, not to eliminate but to preserve. <words>298</words> Each toxic plant became a metaphor for restraint, each deadly compound a lesson in mercy. <words>314</words> The whispers approved, growing softer as she wrote, the house itself exhaling decades of held breath. <words>330</words>

Through her insomnia-brightened eyes, she saw how the botanist before her had transformed this attic from a laboratory of death into a sanctuary of choice. <words>355</words> His ghost—if ghost he was—had tried to tell her through creaking floorboards and rustling papers: the most profound power was the power unused. <words>379</words>

By dawn, she'd written her first poem of peace, surrounded by her meticulously messy arrangement of beautiful, dangerous, impotent things. <words>399</words> The warnings in whispers had become lullabies at last, and for the first time in weeks, she felt the gentle pull of approaching sleep. <words>424</words> The haunted attic had taught her what violence never could: that true strength bloomed in the space between capability and action. <words>446</words>

She closed her eyes among the botanical samples, finally understanding. <words>456</words> To discover the power of non-violence was to hold death in your hands and choose, always choose, to let it sleep. <words>478</words>
