The uptight scribe adjusted his collar for the third time as he climbed the narrow path between weathered gravestones, each step bringing him closer to the witch's greenhouse that clung impossibly to the hillside. <words>33</words> Years of meticulous record-keeping had not prepared him for this certainly uncertain moment, when his ordered world would crack like old parchment. <words>54</words> Inside the glass structure, among shelves of bottled moonlight and pressed shadows, sat Tesla's prototype light bulb—stolen, they said, though the witch claimed it was gifted. <words>81</words> 

He had come to document its authenticity by analyzing the leftover adhesive from a once-sealed envelope found beneath it, the yellowed paper bearing Tesla's own seal. <words>107</words> The witch watched from behind climbing vines, her eyes reflecting something ancient as the scribe's gloved fingers trembled over his instruments. <words>128</words> "You seek proof," she said softly, "but what you'll find is transformation." <words>140</words>

The adhesive sample revealed more than dates and origins—embedded within were microscopic letters, a message Tesla had hidden for whoever would look closely enough. <words>165</words> As the scribe decoded each word through his magnifying lens, the prototype bulb began to glow with impossible colors, casting his shadow in directions that defied physics. <words>193</words> The message spoke of empathy as electricity, of human connection as the truest current, of how rigid souls must learn to bend without breaking. <words>217</words>

"This can't be," he wanted to bellow, but the words emerged as a whisper. <words>231</words> The witch's greenhouse suddenly felt alive, each plant breathing in rhythm with his quickening pulse, the gravestones below seeming less like endings and more like patient seeds. <words>259</words> In that moment when a puzzle piece finally fits, the scribe understood that his lifetime of precise documentation had been armor against feeling too deeply. <words>285</words>

The prototype light bulb pulsed brighter, and he saw his reflection transformed in its glass—not the rigid keeper of facts he'd always been, but someone capable of cradling empathy in arms of steel. <words>319</words> His pen moved across fresh paper, recording not just data but the weight of wonder, the texture of possibility. <words>339</words> "Tesla knew," the witch murmured, tending to a plant that bloomed only in darkness. <words>353</words> "Some inventions illuminate rooms, others illuminate souls." <words>360</words>

The scribe's quiet transformation continued as he worked, his notes becoming poetry, his measurements becoming music. <words>376</words> Below them, the graveyard held its breath, and above them, the greenhouse glass caught the last light of day like hope preserved in amber. <words>401</words> He would leave different than he came, carrying within him the buried optimism that even the most uptight soul could learn to unfold, gently, like a letter that had waited decades to be opened. <words>435</words>
