The rebellion had gutted the capital, but Marisa still sculpted her sugar phoenixes in the forgotten market's ruins, each confection a precisely creative insult to the regime that murdered her sister. <words>24</words> The other vendors had fled months ago, leaving only broken stalls and the acrid memory of tear gas. <words>41</words> She worked by candlelight, crystallizing caramel into wings that caught fire-gold in the darkness, her hands steady despite the trembling rage that never left her bones. <words>68</words>

Today's sculpture was different—a sugar-glass locket, transparent as grief. <words>78</words> Inside, she embedded a photograph: her sister at seven, laughing beside a fountain that no longer existed. <words>95</words> This was her counterattack against forgetting, against the state's erasure of dissidents from history itself. <words>110</words>

A shadow moved between the abandoned fruit stands. <words>118</words> Marisa's hand found the knife she kept beneath her workbench, but the figure merely placed something on her table and vanished. <words>139</words> A map, hand-drawn on rice paper, showing a continent unmarked on any official chart. <words>154</words> Attached was a note: "She believed this existed. Follow the photographs." <words>165</words>

No signature, but Marisa recognized the handwriting—her sister's contact in the underground, someone who'd risked everything to leave her these breadcrumbs of anonymous kindness. <words>189</words> The map led through the market's maze, past the fountain where execution posts now stood. <words>205</words>

She found the first photograph wedged behind a collapsed awning: her sister at fifteen, holding a compass. <words>222</words> The second, tucked inside a shattered display case: her sister at twenty, studying maritime charts. <words>238</words> Each image pulled Marisa deeper into the market's bowels, toward memories she'd buried beneath her vendetta. <words>254</words>

The final photograph waited in the old spice merchant's vault: her sister at twenty-three, standing on a dock Marisa didn't recognize, pointing toward an empty horizon with ardent scorn for the borders that trapped them both. <words>291</words> Behind the photo, wrapped in oilcloth, was the forgotten locket Marisa had given her sister before she'd joined the resistance—the original her sugar sculpture mimicked. <words>316</words>

Inside wasn't their childhood picture, but coordinates. <words>323</words>

The revolution raged above ground, but Marisa understood now that her sister's true rebellion had been this secret search for the hidden continent, a place beyond the regime's reach. <words>351</words> The anonymous gifts weren't just kindness—they were recruitment. <words>360</words> Someone wanted her to complete her sister's journey. <words>368</words>

Marisa returned to her workbench and began sculpting a ship from spun sugar and crystallized honey, each sail a promise. <words>388</words> Tomorrow, she would leave the market's shadows and the vendetta that had sustained her. <words>402</words> The forgotten continent called, and she would answer with the same precisely creative determination that had kept her alive throughout the rebellion's darkest days. <words>427</words> Her sister's dream deserved more than revenge—it deserved fulfillment. <words>436</words>
