The weathered poet climbed through darkness, her headlamp dead since the third power outage swept the mountain. <words>14</words> She navigated by touch alone through the blooming labyrinth of bonsai forests on the mountaintop, where miniature cherry blossoms released their perfume into the blackout night. <words>41</words> Each tiny forest formed a room in the maze, cultivated by monks who'd abandoned this sanctuary decades ago when the electrical grid first began its slow collapse. <words>68</words>

In her pocket, she carried an unmarked makeup compact—not for cosmetics, but for the mirror inside that caught moonlight and revealed the sacred flows she'd come to map. <words>97</words> The flows were invisible currents of energy that pulsed between the bonsai groves, and during power outages, they grew stronger, as if the absence of electricity awakened something ancient. <words>126</words>

She paused at a clearing where paper coffee cups littered the ground, left by pilgrims who'd visited before. <words>144</words> By reading confessions on coffee cup sleeves, scrawled in desperate handwriting during their own blackout journeys, she learned the paths others had taken through the labyrinth. <words>170</words> "I lost my daughter here," one read. <words>177</words> "The trees whispered her name back to me." <words>185</words> Another: "During the outage, I finally heard my own heartbeat." <words>195</words>

The poet understood these messages as invitations to breathe, to pause in the ideally messy intersection between modern collapse and timeless growth. <words>217</words> The bonsai forests thrived in their contained chaos—roots tangled, branches reaching in impossible directions, all meticulously maintained disorder. <words>235</words>

She had to grasp the pattern tonight. <words>242</words> The power outages were lasting longer each time, and she suspected they would soon become permanent. <words>258</words> Opening the compact, she angled it toward the moon and watched silver light bounce across the miniature canopies. <words>276</words> There—a shimmer of flow between two groves of juniper, a sacred current that connected this mountaintop to something vast and breathing below. <words>298</words>

With joyful dread, she realized the flows formed a map of the mountain's consciousness itself. <words>313</words> Each bonsai forest was a neuron, each sacred flow a synapse firing in the dark. <words>328</words> The power outages weren't destroying anything; they were revealing what had always been here, waiting. <words>343</words>

She pulled a pen from her coat and wrote on a discarded coffee sleeve: "The mountain dreams of us as we dream of electricity. <words>367</words> Both are illusions. <words>370</words> The invitation to breathe comes when we stop grasping for the light switch and start tending the small forests within." <words>389</words>

The poet placed the cup where another pilgrim would find it, then continued mapping the sacred flows, her weathered hands steady despite the beautiful terror of understanding. <words>416</words> Tomorrow the power might return, or it might not. <words>425</words> Either way, the bonsai would keep blooming in their eternal maze, and she would be here, breathing with them in the ideally messy darkness. <words>449</words>
