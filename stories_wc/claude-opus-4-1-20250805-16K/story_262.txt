The ancient Roman bathhouse had been transformed into Vienna's most intimate concert hall, its marble columns now supporting perfect acoustics instead of steam. <words>20</words> Professor Mariana Voss stood backstage, her human disguise impeccable except for the slight shimmer when stage lights caught her at wrong angles. <words>40</words> She clutched a single puzzle tile—obsidian, carved with symbols that predated Rome itself—knowing tonight's performance would either save or doom the knowledge hidden within it. <words>66</words>

For three years, she'd taught music theory at the conservatory, righteously flawed in her methods, pushing students beyond conventional boundaries while secretly searching for the one who could hear what others couldn't. <words>97</words> Her species had entrusted her with fragments of their civilization's greatest achievement: a mathematical symphony that could unlock faster-than-light travel, scattered across Earth in architectural resonances. <words>123</words>

The church organ, relocated here during the bathhouse's rebirth, began its lonely reverberation through the space. <words>140</words> Throughout concerts past, Mariana had compared each performer's interpretation, listening for someone who could channel fear into transcendence. <words>159</words> Tonight, her student Jakob would play—a prodigy whose terror of imperfection had nearly destroyed his gift. <words>176</words>

She'd taught him with fierce tenderness, recognizing in his anxiety the same paralysis that had frozen her people when their world began dying. <words>200</words> "Fear is just unplayed music," she'd whispered during lessons, her alien consciousness bleeding through in metaphors no human teacher would use. <words>221</words>

Jakob's fingers found the keys, and immediately Mariana heard it—the harmonic pattern that matched the tile's engravings. <words>239</words> The bathhouse's ancient stones began resonating, their Roman engineering accidentally creating the perfect amphitheater for interdimensional acoustics. <words>256</words> Each note compared against the cosmic equation encoded in the architecture, solving piece by piece what her people had scattered for safekeeping. <words>279</words>

As Jakob played, his fear transformed into fierce determination, no longer comparing himself to others but to the infinite possibility within the music itself. <words>304</words> The puzzle tile grew warm in Mariana's hand, its surface beginning to project holographic star charts visible only to her. <words>325</words>

The audience heard a masterpiece; Mariana heard salvation. <words>333</words> Throughout concerts spanning centuries, her predecessors had waited for this convergence—a human soul breaking free from fear at the precise moment when Earth's technology could comprehend the gift. <words>361</words> The organ's lonely reverberations carried the complete equation now, embedded in Jakob's fearless interpretation. <words>376</words>

When the last note faded, Mariana knew her mission was complete. <words>387</words> The knowledge would surface gradually in human consciousness—in dreams of engineers, in physicist's equations, in a student's sudden understanding that the universe was far more welcoming than they'd feared. <words>416</words> She touched the tile once more, feeling her people's gratitude pulse through dimensions, then slipped it into Jakob's coat pocket backstage. <words>438</words> He would discover it later and think it merely a teacher's peculiar gift, never knowing he'd already unlocked its secrets by breaking free. <words>462</words>
