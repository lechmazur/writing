Margot, who once strangled a competitor's prize orchid with fishing wire at the Chelsea Flower Show, steered her van toward the stone circle while her passenger hummed. <words>26</words> She ran the scuffed plastic comb through her hair—a nervous habit from her days before she'd learned to weaponize beauty. <words>46</words> 

"You understand the watcher's burden," said the hitchhiker between verses of his folk song, his voice carrying that intellectually spontaneous quality of someone who'd studied chaos theory and tarot with equal fervor. <words>78</words> 

"I arrange flowers," Margot replied tersely. <words>84</words> "Nothing more." <words>86</words>

"But you distinguish patterns others miss—that's why you're driving to Castlerigg at midnight to decode the rock art spiraling across those megaliths." <words>108</words>

She'd picked him up impulsively outside Durham, drawn by his sign reading "Seeking Stone Circle Conspirators." <words>124</words> Their spontaneous road trip conversations had meandered through botanical terrorism, prehistoric astronomy, and the peculiar ethics of destroying ugliness to create sublime arrangements. <words>147</words>

"The burden," he continued, pausing again in his melody, "is seeing what must be done while others sleep." <words>165</words>

Margot smiled—a expression her rivals called her "death bloom grin." <words>175</words> "You're suggesting my particular ruthlessness serves a purpose beyond competition ribbons?" <words>186</words>

"I'm suggesting," he said, resuming his tune briefly before stopping again, "that someone who can spot a single wilted petal in a thousand-rose installation might distinguish something crucial in those carved symbols." <words>218</words>

The stone circle materialized through fog like ancient teeth. <words>227</words> Margot parked, pocketing her comb—her grandmother's, worn smooth by three generations of women who'd understood that beauty and violence were intimate partners. <words>250</words>

"Polite anarchy," she murmured, studying the moonlit stones. <words>258</words> "That's what you practice, isn't it?" <words>265</words> "Disrupting reality's arrangements without raising your voice." <words>272</words>

The hitchhiker laughed, his breath misting. <words>278</words> "And you practice ruthless beauty—murdering the mundane to birth the extraordinary." <words>289</words>

Together they approached the rock art, its spirals seeming to pulse. <words>300</words> Margot's trained eye caught what archaeologists had missed: the patterns matched the Fibonacci sequences she used in her most devastating arrangements. <words>322</words>

"The burden of watching," she said softly, tracing the carvings, "is knowing that someone must act on what they see." <words>342</words>

"Even if that action seems cruel?" <words>348</words> the singer asked.

"Especially then," Margot replied, understanding finally why she'd driven here—why her ruthlessness with flowers had always been practice for something larger. <words>370</words> The rock art wasn't decoration; it was instruction, a blueprint for remaking the world's bouquet. <words>385</words>

The singer began a new verse as she worked to decode the ancient design, and Margot knew that by dawn, everything would be beautifully, terribly rearranged. <words>411</words>
