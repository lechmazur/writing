Captain Elara Voss gripped the detached coat button between her fingers, the brass worn smooth from generations of pilots before her. <words>18</words> The abandoned spaceport baggage claim stretched endlessly around her, its conveyor belts frozen mid-rotation like the ribs of some mechanical whale. <words>39</words> Above, through shattered skylights, her flying library hovered—the last of its kind, carrying humanity's final collection of physical books between dying colonies. <words>62</words>

She knelt beside a puddle of ancient coffee, spilled decades ago but preserved in the vacuum-sealed terminal. <words>79</words> The stains formed patterns she'd learned to read from her grandmother, another library pilot who'd understood that knowledge existed in more forms than text. <words>104</words> This spiritually secular practice—neither prayer nor science, but something between—had guided pilots through the void when instruments failed. <words>123</words>

The coffee revealed what she feared: obliteration. <words>130</words> Not of worlds or ships, but of memory itself. <words>139</words> The colonies were forgetting how to read, choosing neural downloads over the sacred act of turning pages. <words>156</words> Her cargo had become archaeological curiosity rather than living wisdom. <words>166</words>

The button had belonged to her predecessor, Captain Zhou, who'd died defending his library from scavengers. <words>182</words> She'd found it here, in this very terminal, where he'd made his last stand. <words>196</words> The coffee stains showed her his final moment—a single question from the raiders: "Surrender?" <words>210</words> His "No" had cost him everything but preserved the tradition for one more generation. <words>224</words>

Now the same question echoed in her present. <words>232</words> The Colonial Authority's message blinked on her wrist display: "Decommission the library program?" <words>245</words> In the second a simple yes or no can change everything, she understood the weight Zhou had carried. <words>263</words>

The fractal sorrow of it spread through her consciousness—how each lost reader created exponential emptiness, each forgotten story spawning infinite untold ones. <words>285</words> The grief replicated itself like a virus of forgetting, smaller and smaller iterations of loss spreading through humanity's collective soul. <words>305</words>

She pressed the button into the coffee, watching new patterns form. <words>316</words> The future shifted: she saw children in pressure suits, crowding into her library's hull, their eyes wide with wonder at paper that crinkled and smelled of vanilla and time. <words>346</words> She saw the bridge to unity that physical books created—strangers sharing dog-eared copies, communities gathering for readings, the tactile democracy of knowledge that no download could replicate. <words>374</words>

Her finger hovered over the display. <words>380</words> "No," she whispered, and the word became destiny. <words>389</words> The flying library's engines roared to life above, ready to carry its precious cargo toward whatever readers remained, preserving the fading tradition with each delivered book, each turned page a small rebellion against forgetting. <words>424</words>

Elara pocketed Zhou's button and walked toward her ship, leaving fresh footprints in decades of dust. <words>440</words> The abandoned terminal would remember her choice, as it had remembered his. <words>452</words> Some bridges to unity are built one reader at a time. <words>463</words>
