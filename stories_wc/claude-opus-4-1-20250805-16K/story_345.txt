Father Marcus jogged between towering beanstalks that spiraled into morning clouds, their leaves casting shadows like cathedral windows across the labyrinth orchard floor. <words>21</words> Years of complacency had led him here—first abandoning his parish, then wandering aimlessly until the world itself seemed to reshape around his indifference. <words>44</words> He clutched an ancient abacus with missing beads, the gaps between the remaining spheres measuring not numbers but the spaces where his faith once lived. <words>70</words> The orchard paths twisted endlessly, each turn revealing another corridor of verdant giants, their pods hanging like bells that would never ring. <words>92</words>

Snow had fallen during the night—impossible at this altitude, yet there it was, tracing patterns between the stalks like messages written in a forgotten tongue. <words>118</words> Marcus followed these crystalline trails, jogging steadily, unapologetically confused by their meaning yet certain they led somewhere beyond the predetermined routes he'd always taken. <words>142</words> The beads clicked on their rods as he moved, counting nothing, counting everything, counting the cost of all those years spent accepting what was given rather than seeking what was possible. <words>173</words>

Through the hush of fate unraveling, he heard it—not a sound but an absence of sound, the moment when destiny pauses to reconsider its trajectory. <words>199</words> The snow patterns converged ahead, forming a spiral that wound around a massive stalk whose trunk pulsed with dull radiance, as if starlight had been trapped beneath bark and was slowly leaking through. <words>232</words> Marcus had spent decades believing that paths were set, that his fall from grace was written in some cosmic ledger he could never balance. <words>256</words> But here, where beans grew toward heaven and snow defied season, he understood that complacency had been his only sin—not the questioning, not the doubt, but the surrender to them. <words>287</words>

He pressed his palm against the glowing stalk, feeling its warmth spread through fingers that had once blessed bread and wine. <words>308</words> The abacus trembled, and he watched as new beads materialized in the empty spaces, not replacing what was lost but creating something entirely different—a new mathematics of possibility. <words>336</words> To step beyond fate's design meant accepting confusion as a companion rather than an enemy, meant jogging when others would walk, meant following snow that shouldn't exist toward destinations that couldn't be mapped. <words>369</words> The labyrinth orchard stretched infinite around him, no longer a prison of predetermined paths but a universe of choices, each branching stalk a different story he could tell himself about who he might become. <words>402</words> Marcus jogged onward, the incomplete abacus clicking its strange arithmetic, counting the steps that would carry him beyond the price of standing still. <words>426</words> In the dull radiance of morning, he was both lost and found, lapsed and renewed, running through the hush toward whatever lay beyond fate's carefully drawn borders. <words>454</words>
