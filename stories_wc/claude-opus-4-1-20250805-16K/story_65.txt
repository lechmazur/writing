The brass doorplate read "Melody Thornweaver, Slapdash Bard," though it hung crooked on the cave entrance where two tectonic plates kissed with geological fury. <words>20</words>

Every year on the anniversary of her almost-death, Melody's family gathered here for their peculiar picnic, spreading checkered blankets over the trembling earth where continental shelves groaned against each other. <words>50</words>

This sacred space, where the world literally split apart and reformed, had saved her life once—or perhaps she'd never truly left it. <words>73</words>

"The hourglass turns again," her grandmother whispered, watching the ancient timepiece mounted in the cave wall begin its possibly impossible reversal, sand flowing upward like tears returning to eyes. <words>102</words>

Melody strummed her lute with fingers that remembered being cold, being still, being nothing. <words>117</words>

Seven years ago, she'd fallen through a fissure during an earthquake, tumbling into this underground cathedral where time moved differently, where death had grabbed her ankle but couldn't quite pull her down. <words>149</words>

The family tradition started the next year—their way of disrupting death's claim, celebrating her survival by returning to feast where she should have perished. <words>174</words>

"Play us something cheerful, dear," her mother said, though her eyes glistened with that particular melancholic glee that comes from loving someone you almost lost. <words>199</words>

Melody obliged, her slapdash style perfect for this imperfect place—notes bouncing off crystalline walls, harmonizing with the earth's deep rumbles. <words>219</words>

She'd been a perfectionist before the fall, every performance meticulously planned. <words>230</words>

But down here, suspended between tectonic plates for three days while rescue crews searched, she'd learned that sacred spaces don't care about perfect pitch. <words>254</words>

They only care about honest sound, about the music that escapes when you're escaping death's clutches. <words>270</words>

Her nephew spread jam on bread while the ground shivered, completely unafraid. <words>282</words>

This was normal for him—picnicking on the edge of the world, watching his aunt play for the stones that had caught her, thanking them with every discordant, beautiful note. <words>312</words>

"The sand's almost back to the beginning," her grandmother announced, and they all turned to watch the hourglass complete its impossible reversal. <words>335</words>

For exactly seventeen minutes each year, while the hourglass reset, the boundary between life and death grew thin here. <words>354</words>

Melody could feel it—death still reaching, still grasping, but unable to cross into this sacred threshold where earth plates danced their slow, violent dance. <words>379</words>

She played louder, sloppier, more alive, disrupting the silence death preferred with her family's laughter, with clinking glasses, with the magnificent chaos of survival. <words>403</words>

The brass doorplate rattled against stone as another tremor passed through, but nobody moved to straighten it. <words>420</words>

Some things were meant to hang crooked, to remind you that perfection was never the point. <words>437</words>

Living was. <words>439</words>
