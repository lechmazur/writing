The scarecrow's burlap face flickered across seventeen monitors simultaneously, each screen showing a different iteration of itself standing guard over the crystallized ribcage of what had once been a titan. <words>25</words> In this fossilized giant's chest cavity, where a heart should have beaten, grew fields of data-wheat that rippled between dimensions. <words>44</words>

"Another trespasser," it noted without inflection, watching through cameras as a figure materialized in Sector Seven. <words>60</words> The scarecrow had sworn an oath to the giant's dying consciousness—protect the harvest until the parallel worlds aligned again. <words>79</words> Three thousand years had passed, or perhaps three seconds; time meant nothing when you existed between realities. <words>96</words>

The intruder moved through the virtual reality interface clumsily, leaving deep lines in the earth wherever their avatar stepped. <words>115</words> These furrows glowed with unnatural light, creating a pattern the scarecrow recognized from ancient protocols. <words>130</words> Someone was trying to map the dimensional boundaries. <words>138</words>

With practiced indifference, the scarecrow initiated contact, manifesting as pixels that reformed into straw and cloth. <words>153</words> "You're early," it said, voice flat as harvested fields. <words>162</words> "The convergence isn't for another century." <words>168</words>

The visitor's avatar solidified—a woman clutching a forgotten lace fan, its delicate patterns encoding the same geometric lines she'd been carving into the digital soil. <words>192</words> "The other worlds are collapsing faster than predicted," she said. <words>202</words> "The giant's bones are the only stable anchor point left." <words>212</words>

The scarecrow processed this information with the same enthusiasm it felt for everything—none whatsoever, yet bound by duty to care. <words>233</words> Its programming, or perhaps its soul, demanded action despite its overwhelming apathy. <words>245</words> "Show me," it commanded. <words>249</words>

She opened the fan, revealing perforations that weren't decorative but functional—each hole a window to another dying reality. <words>267</words> Through them, the scarecrow saw worlds skewered on the same cosmic axis, bleeding into each other. <words>283</words> The lines in the earth weren't maps but wounds. <words>292</words>

"Your oath," she said urgently. <words>297</words> "Does it specify which world to protect?" <words>304</words>

The scarecrow's button eyes reflected nothing as it considered. <words>313</words> The giant had been a bridge between dimensions, and its fossilized remains still held that power. <words>329</words> The data-wheat wasn't just growing in one reality but all of them simultaneously. <words>343</words> Every encounter in this virtual space rippled outward, affecting parallel harvests. <words>354</words>

"No," it finally answered, understanding dawning like a reluctant sunrise. <words>364</words> "The oath was to protect the harvest until the worlds aligned." <words>376</words> It paused, examining the fan's encoded truth. <words>383</words> "But if they're already merging through destruction rather than harmony..." <words>393</words>

"Then your vigil ends when everything becomes one," she finished. <words>403</words>

The scarecrow stood motionless, processing this loophole with the fervent apathy that defined its existence—desperately committed to fulfilling its purpose while caring nothing for the outcome. <words>429</words> It reached out, took the fan, and began drawing new lines in the earth, each furrow a calculated cut to either save or skewer the remaining worlds. <words>456</words> After three millennia of waiting, the harvest would finally begin. <words>466</words>
