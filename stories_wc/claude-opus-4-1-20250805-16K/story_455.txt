Marcel had tended the wishing well beneath Prague's embassy district for thirty years, growing more disgruntled with each coin that plunked into darkness. <words>20</words> His collection of foreign coins, pilfered from wishes never meant to come true, weighed heavy in his coat pockets—each one carrying the weight of scars from lives he'd never lived. <words>50</words> The well itself sat at the crossing of two unwritten paths: the official tourist route above, and below, a secret agent escape route carved during the Cold War. <words>78</words> 

Tonight, Marcel waited with an intensely relaxed posture that only decades of disappointment could teach. <words>93</words> The shadows cast by the embassy's security lights formed patterns on the cobblestones, patterns he'd memorized like a language only he could read. <words>117</words> By following shadow patterns that shifted with each passing cloud, he could corroborate what the coins had been whispering: someone was coming through the old route tonight. <words>145</words>

The weight of scars wasn't just metaphorical for Marcel. <words>154</words> His left hand bore burns from the night he'd pulled a drowning operative from the well, back when he still believed in redemption. <words>177</words> That agent had dropped a handful of foreign coins—deutschmarks, francs, rubles—before vanishing into the escape route, leaving Marcel with currency from countries that no longer existed. <words>204</words>

The inherited mystery of this place had been passed to him by the previous attendant, a woman who spoke in riddles about the crossing of two unwritten paths. <words>232</words> She'd told him that some nights, when the shadows aligned just right, the old ghosts would test him. <words>250</words> They would judge whether he was worthy of keeping their secrets, whether he could out-face their silent judgments without breaking. <words>270</words>

A figure emerged from the maintenance door, moving through the prescribed shadow patterns with practiced ease. <words>286</words> Marcel didn't look up, just continued sorting his collection of foreign coins with the intensely relaxed demeanor of someone who'd seen too much to be surprised. <words>313</words> The stranger paused at the well's edge, dropped something metallic into the water, and whispered in a language Marcel recognized from the old coins. <words>337</words>

"The crossing is clear," Marcel said, his voice carrying the weight of scars both seen and unseen. <words>354</words> The figure nodded and descended into the secret agent escape route hidden beneath the well's false bottom. <words>371</words> Marcel pocketed the new coin—cryptocurrency etched in metal, a wish for invisibility in the digital age. <words>387</words> He'd successfully out-faced the silent judgments of old ghosts once more, corroborating his purpose at this forgotten intersection where past and future conspiracies met. <words>411</words> The inherited mystery would continue through him, one disgruntled wish at a time. <words>425</words>
