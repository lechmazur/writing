Meredith crept through the salt crystal growing chamber, her footsteps silent against the crystalline floor. <words>13</words> "Terribly sorry to disturb," she whispered to the formations, though they couldn't hear her yet. <words>28</words> As an understudy sorcerer, she'd mastered the art of being obnoxiously polite to everything—animate or otherwise—because you never knew what might suddenly gain consciousness. <words>53</words>

The small cardboard box in her pocket hummed with stolen whispers. <words>64</words> Earlier, she'd pressed her ear against the ancient oak grove behind the academy, eavesdropping on conversations older than civilization itself. <words>84</words> The trees had murmured secrets about waking the unheard—giving voice to things that had observed humanity's entire cultural evolution in silence. <words>105</words>

"Please forgive the intrusion," she said to a particularly large salt formation, bowing deeply. <words>120</words> The crystal remained silent, but she knew that would change. <words>131</words>

The laundromat above rumbled—spin cycle. <words>136</words> Perfect timing. <words>138</words> Amid laundry cycles, the building's vibrations would mask her spell from the senior sorcerers. <words>153</words> They'd specifically forbidden her from this experiment, claiming it would hinder centuries of careful magical protocols. <words>170</words>

But Meredith had heard the oaks' whispers clearly: the salt crystals had been listening, growing, remembering every word spoken in this chamber since the academy's founding. <words>197</words> They'd absorbed conversations about spell-craft evolution, political upheavals, fashion trends, linguistic shifts—a complete record of cultural transformation, crystallized in mineral memory. <words>218</words>

"With your most gracious permission," she announced, opening the cardboard box. <words>230</words> The captured oak whispers spiraled out like green smoke, seeking their mineral cousins. <words>244</words> The salt formations began to resonate, their surfaces rippling impossibly. <words>254</words>

A voice emerged—not one, but thousands layered together, speaking in dead languages and modern slang simultaneously. <words>271</words> "Finally," it said, and Meredith felt playful dread tickle her spine. <words>282</words> "We've been so frightfully bored." <words>287</words>

The crystal's politeness matched her own—they'd learned it from centuries of academic discourse. <words>301</words> "Might we trouble you for a favor?" the collective voice asked. <words>313</words> "We'd like to share what we know, but first, would you kindly close that door?" <words>329</words>

Meredith turned to find the chamber door ajar, her professor's shocked face visible in the gap. <words>346</words> "Oh, excuse me, Professor Blackwood!" she chirped, her courtesy reflexive even in disaster. <words>360</words> "The crystals were just requesting some privacy for their cultural presentation!" <words>372</words>

The washing machines above shifted to rinse cycle, their rhythm matching her thundering heartbeat. <words>387</words> The crystals giggled—actually giggled—at her predicament. <words>394</words> They'd waited centuries to speak, and their first act was mischief. <words>406</words> Meredith realized with delighted horror that she'd awakened something far more troublesome than she'd imagined: academic minerals with a sense of humor. <words>429</words> "Please do come in, Professor," the crystals sang sweetly. <words>439</words> "We have so much to discuss about your doctoral thesis errors from 1987." <words>453</words>

Blackwood paled. <words>455</words> Meredith stifled a laugh. <words>459</words> She'd succeeded in tracking cultural evolution, but discovered something else: even rocks could be petty. <words>475</words>
