Margot pressed her fingertips against the copper pennies, each one flattened by trains she'd never seen, collecting memories of journeys she'd never taken. <words>19</words> The living statues of the enchanted orchard had confiscated them last Tuesday, but she'd stolen them back with calculated precision, leaving origami butterflies in their place. <words>44</words>

She was their patient guardian now, though the irony wasn't lost on her. <words>57</words> The statues oscillated between fury and bewilderment, their stone faces cracking with expressions that shouldn't exist on granite. <words>75</words> They'd trapped her here at the threshold of an apology yet to be spoken—hers to them, or theirs to her, she couldn't tell anymore. <words>99</words>

"You follow moon paths," the eldest statue had accused, its voice like grinding millstones. <words>114</words> "You slip between what is and what dreams." <words>122</words>

Margot had laughed then, a sound both bitter and delighted. <words>132</words> Of course she followed moon paths—how else could a vivid dreamer navigate an orchard where apple blossoms sang funeral dirges and pears grew backwards into seeds? <words>158</words> Her rational mischief was the only weapon against their suffocating order. <words>169</words>

The pressed pennies held the truth: each one bore the face of a different cosmos, a different version of reality where the statues weren't guardians but prisoners. <words>196</words> She'd discovered this by accident, holding them up to moonlight, watching Abraham Lincoln's profile shift into constellations that spelled out warnings. <words>216</words>

"The ultimate cosmic deception," she muttered, arranging the pennies in a spiral pattern on the moss-covered ground. <words>233</words> The statues claimed to protect the orchard from intruders, but Margot had seen them feeding dreams to the trees, harvesting nightmares like fruit. <words>256</words>

Tonight, she would force their confession. <words>262</words> The moon paths converged here, silver threads she could pull to unravel their carefully constructed lie. <words>278</words> She'd spent months pretending to be their captive, letting them believe she was just another dreamer lost in their web. <words>298</words>

The youngest statue approached, its footsteps making the earth tremble with unspoken sorrow. <words>311</words> "You know what we are," it said, not a question but a resignation. <words>324</words>

"Failed gods," Margot replied, her voice carrying that particular shade of dour amusement she'd perfected during her imprisonment. <words>342</words> "Feeding on dreams because you've forgotten how to create your own." <words>353</words>

The pressed pennies began to glow, each one a tiny rebellion against the cosmic order. <words>368</words> The statues gathered closer, their apology forming in the air like frost, but Margot was already walking the moon path backward, unweaving their deception thread by thread. <words>395</words> She would guard this truth patiently, rationally, mischievously, until the universe remembered what it had deliberately forgotten. <words>411</words> The orchard shuddered, recognizing its true warden at last. <words>420</words>
