The tired swordsman sat in the floating rock monastery's breakroom, his plain cloth bag slumped against the stone wall like a defeated soldier. <words>19</words> Master Chen had just resigned, leaving only the echo of his footsteps and the weight of unfinished lessons. <words>36</words> Through the window, meteor showers traced silver paths across the void between the drifting peaks. <words>51</words>

"You're not following them," said Brother Wei, pouring tea with practiced indifference. <words>63</words>

The swordsman's fierce apathy had become legendary among the monks—he attended every training, mastered every form, yet his eyes remained empty as the sky between stars. <words>90</words> "Following lights in the dark seems rather pointless," he replied, though his fingers unconsciously traced the bag's worn fabric. <words>108</words>

Wei smiled with that particular knowing naivety the monastery cultivated, the kind that saw through everything while pretending to see nothing. <words>129</words> "Master Chen followed them once. <words>134</words> Said the meteors showed him which floating rocks would align, creating passages to places we're told don't exist." <words>152</words>

The swordsman's apathy flickered—just barely—like a spark of defiance against wet kindling. <words>164</words> Inside his bag lay Chen's final note: *The promise you made to yourself still matters.* <words>180</words> How the old master knew about his vow to find the source of his teacher's death, he'd never understood. <words>199</words>

"The meteors return every seventy years," Wei continued, watching the swordsman's carefully maintained disinterest. <words>213</words> "Tonight's the last night." <words>217</words>

The swordsman stood, his exhaustion so complete it had circled back to a strange clarity. <words>233</words> His fierce apathy had always been armor, protecting that single spark of defiance he'd buried after losing everything. <words>252</words> But promises to oneself, he'd learned, were chains that grew heavier with time. <words>266</words>

"Where do they lead?" he asked, already knowing Wei wouldn't answer directly. <words>278</words>

"To overcome what holds us here requires following what pulls us away." <words>290</words> Wei's naivety was showing again, that infuriating wisdom dressed as simplicity. <words>301</words>

The swordsman shouldered his plain cloth bag, feeling the weight of Chen's training scrolls inside—not resignation, but a different kind of departure. <words>323</words> The meteor showers intensified, their trails forming a pattern only visible to those desperate enough to look. <words>340</words>

He walked to the monastery's edge where stone met infinite sky. <words>351</words> His apathy and exhaustion remained, but now they served the spark rather than smothering it. <words>367</words> The meteors curved downward, marking a path across the floating rocks that would exist for mere hours. <words>385</words>

Sometimes keeping a promise to oneself meant following lights that might lead nowhere. <words>398</words> The swordsman stepped into the void, his fierce apathy finally useful—caring too much about falling would only guarantee it. <words>417</words> Behind him, Wei watched with knowing naivety, understanding that some victories required first appearing to give up entirely. <words>435</words>

The meteors blazed overhead, and the tired swordsman followed. <words>444</words>
