Knight Severin pressed his palm against the frosted glass door of the secret agent center, watching his breath cloud in the November cold. <words>22</words> The building masqueraded as an abandoned warehouse, but inside, incomplete family altars lined the corridors—each one missing a crucial element that field agents were tasked to retrieve. <words>49</words> His mission tonight was different: collect folk remedies from twelve global sources, each one verified through generational wisdom rather than laboratory testing. <words>71</words>

At the hush of a deserted intersection late at night, something small caught his eye beneath the streetlamp. <words>89</words> A child's lost mitten, hand-knitted with uneven stitches, lay frozen in a puddle. <words>103</words> He picked it up, and suddenly the wool's texture triggered something unexpected—his grandmother's fingers teaching him to knit before the agency recruited him. <words>127</words>

Inside the center, Knight placed the mitten on his assigned altar, the one marked "Severin Family—Incomplete Since 1987." <words>145</words> The other agents called him cold-natured, efficient, emotionless. <words>154</words> They didn't know about his lawfully rebellious practice of adding unauthorized objects to the altars, items that supported the healing protocols he secretly developed. <words>179</words> The mitten wasn't regulation, but it belonged here. <words>188</words>

As he arranged dried herbs beside the mitten, his fingers began moving differently—not with tactical precision but with artistic intention. <words>209</words> The altar transformed under his touch: elderflower for fever, willow bark for pain, chamomile for sleeplessness, each remedy positioned like brushstrokes. <words>231</words> Other agents started gathering, drawn by this artistic awakening happening in real-time. <words>244</words>

"These aren't just ingredients," Knight said, his usually clipped voice softening. <words>255</words> "They're stories, passed through generations of hands that knew suffering and healing intimately." <words>269</words> He wove the mitten's yarn through the arrangement, creating connections between elements that the agency's rigid classifications had kept separate. <words>290</words>

His handler, Morrison, stepped forward. <words>295</words> "This violates protocol, Severin." <words>299</words>

"The protocol is incomplete," Knight replied, continuing his work. <words>308</words> "We gather intelligence but ignore wisdom. <words>315</words> We catalog remedies but dismiss the love that made them effective." <words>326</words> His cold fingers warmed as he worked, the mitten's wool somehow still holding the warmth of the child who'd worn it. <words>348</words>

By dawn, Knight's altar had become the center's first complete healing station, merging folk knowledge with tactical support. <words>367</words> The mitten remained at its heart, a reminder that even cold-natured knights could awaken to beauty, that rebellion could exist within law's boundaries, and that sometimes the smallest lost things could complete the largest puzzles. <words>403</words> The agency would adapt, as it always did, but Knight had already changed, his artistic awakening transforming not just altars but the very mission of gathering wisdom from the world's forgotten corners. <words>436</words>
