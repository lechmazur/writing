Martha kneaded sourdough in her bakery when the shadows began whispering recipes for revolution. <words>13</words> The small-town baker had lived through enough tyranny to recognize opportunity in impossible moments. <words>27</words> She pressed lavender between her palms, watching purple stains bloom like bruises across her flour-dusted skin. <words>44</words> The pressed flowers weren't just decoration anymore; they were the seeds of contagion she'd been cultivating for three years. <words>63</words>

"You're cynically gentle," the shadow of her grandmother murmured from the corner where light couldn't reach. <words>79</words> Martha smiled without warmth, knowing that kindness wielded like a scalpel could cut deeper than cruelty. <words>95</words> She'd poisoned the Governor's bread with truth-spores hidden in pressed violets, each petal carrying memories of his crimes. <words>113</words> When eaten, they would spread through his cabinet like wildfire, forcing confessions from lying tongues. <words>128</words>

The emergency time machine garage beneath her shop hummed with stolen temporal energy. <words>141</words> She'd built it herself by tracking moon patterns, noting when lunar shadows grew dense enough to harvest. <words>158</words> Each full moon, she collected time itself, storing it in mason jars between pickled beets and preserved peaches. <words>176</words> The Governor thought she was harmless, just another provincial baker with calloused hands and simple dreams. <words>192</words>

Tonight, she would exceed every limitation they'd placed on her. <words>202</words> The shadows had taught her their language during the eclipse last spring, when darkness grew bold enough to speak plainly. <words>222</words> They told her about the moment—precisely seventeen hours from now—when the Governor would be vulnerable. <words>237</words> His temporal anchors would weaken as he signed another execution order, his cruelty creating ripples in time itself. <words>254</words>

Martha folded pressed flowers into tomorrow's bread dough with practiced precision. <words>265</words> Each bloom contained memories of the dead, their voices preserved in cellulose and chlorophyll. <words>279</words> The contagion would spread not through disease but through empathy, forcing the Governor to feel every death he'd ordered. <words>298</words> She whispered to the shadow stretching across her work table, asking it to carry her message through the town. <words>317</words>

"Tell them to eat bread at dawn," she said, her cynical gentleness sharpening into purpose. <words>332</words> The shadow nodded, fragmenting into a dozen messengers that slipped under doors and through keyholes. <words>347</words>

In the garage below, the time machine sparked to life, ready to loop this moment if she failed. <words>365</words> But Martha knew she wouldn't need it. <words>372</words> The pressed flowers held too much truth, the shadows spoke too clearly, and her bread had never failed to nourish those who needed sustenance. <words>396</words> Tomorrow, the tyrant would taste his own bitter medicine, served warm with butter and a baker's cynically gentle smile. <words>415</words> The revolution would begin with breakfast, as all proper revolutions should. <words>426</words>
