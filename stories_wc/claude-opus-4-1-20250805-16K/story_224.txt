The minstrel lingered in the giant's dining room, fingers tracing the witch's gnarled wooden ladle hidden beneath his cloak. <words>17</words> Amid rush hour, when lesser servants scurried between massive tables bearing platters the size of wagon wheels, he remained perfectly still. <words>37</words> The giant's guests thundered their conversations overhead, their voices like distant storms, yet the minstrel had discovered something profound in these moments between performances. <words>62</words>

He was openly private here—a paradox that defined his existence. <words>73</words> Everyone saw him waiting to entertain, lute resting against the colossal table leg, but no one truly observed him. <words>93</words> In this visibility, he found invisibility. <words>99</words> In the cacophony, he found his truest silence. <words>108</words>

The ladle had belonged to the witch who'd cursed him to this servitude three winters past. <words>125</words> "Sing for giants until you learn what music truly means," she'd cackled. <words>138</words> But he'd stolen her ladle during his escape, not knowing why until last evening. <words>153</words>

A meteorite had crashed through the dining room's vaulted ceiling during yesterday's feast. <words>167</words> While others fled the molten stone, the minstrel had approached, drawn by inexplicable need. <words>182</words> The ladle had grown warm against his chest. <words>191</words> When he'd pressed the gnarled wood against the meteorite's pocked surface, matching texture to texture, something extraordinary occurred. <words>210</words>

The contact had rejuvenated not his body, but his capacity for wonder. <words>223</words> Colors had deepened. <words>226</words> Sounds had layered into symphonies. <words>231</words> The mundane existence he'd desperately sought to escape had transformed without changing at all. <words>246</words>

Now, as servants rushed past and giants bellowed their demands, the minstrel understood. <words>260</words> His curse wasn't punishment but invitation. <words>267</words> The witch had known that only in serving others could he discover his own sovereignty. <words>283</words>

He stood slowly, ladle secured, and lifted his lute. <words>293</words> The first note rang pure and true, cutting through the dining room's chaos like dawn through night. <words>311</words> One by one, the giants fell silent. <words>319</words> The servants paused mid-stride. <words>324</words> Even the flames in the massive hearth seemed to lean toward his melody. <words>338</words>

This silence didn't demand—it affirmed. <words>344</words> It affirmed his presence, his purpose, his peculiar journey from resentment to revelation. <words>358</words> The minstrel smiled, eyes closed, playing for an audience that finally heard not just his music, but the quiet triumph woven between each note. <words>383</words>

When the song ended, no one applauded. <words>391</words> They didn't need to. <words>396</words> The silence said everything. <words>401</words> In that moment of gentle turmoil—peace wrestling with purpose—the minstrel finally understood that freedom wasn't escape from service, but finding the sacred within it. <words>426</words> Tomorrow he would leave, contract fulfilled, ladle in hand, carrying the giant's silence wherever wandering led. <words>443</words>
