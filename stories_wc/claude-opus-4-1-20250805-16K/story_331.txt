Mira swept the crystalline pathways of the quantum entanglement garden with measured strokes, her movements deliberate yet charged with suppressed urgency. <words>16</words> After the last mountain erodes, they said, no one would remember why humans once folded their hands in prayer or whispered to the stars. <words>40</words> She had outlived geological ages to prevent that prophecy. <words>49</words>

The forgotten music box lay beneath tangled probability vines, its brass surface etched with equations that hurt to perceive directly. <words>69</words> Mira lifted it carefully, knowing what visitors never suspected—this artifact didn't play music but wrote reality's sheet music instead. <words>88</words> She was honestly dishonest about everything here, telling tourists it was merely decorative while secretly using it to encode tomorrow's possibilities. <words>109</words>

"The garden closes at dusk," she announced to the last quantum-pilgrim, her voice steady despite her racing thoughts. <words>128</words> The visitor nodded, unaware that Mira's warning protected them from witnessing what came next. <words>142</words>

As violet shadows stretched across dimensions, the bats emerged—not creatures but living algorithms with membranous wings of pure mathematics. <words>162</words> Their flight patterns agitated the garden's quantum states, stirring probability soup until potential futures bubbled to the surface like dreams. <words>182</words> Mira wound the music box with trembling fingers that betrayed her outward calm. <words>195</words>

Each turn of the key inscribed new futures onto reality's manuscript. <words>206</words> She wrote carefully: a child in Neo-Singapore would dream of ancient meditation tonight; a physicist on Mars would accidentally rediscover the lotus position while solving equations; a poet would remember words her species had forgotten—words like "sacred" and "soul." <words>246</words>

The bats swooped through probability clouds, their echolocation translating Mira's inscriptions into inevitabilities. <words>259</words> This was her true work as caretaker—not maintaining the garden's physical form but preserving humanity's spiritual DNA within tomorrow's genetic code. <words>280</words>

She had told the Council the garden grew only exotic mathematics, a useful deception that let her hide temples in equations and prayers in paradoxes. <words>305</words> Every evening's ritual agitated the established order, but so subtly that reality's guardians mistook revolution for routine maintenance. <words>323</words>

The music box clicked shut, its work complete for another day. <words>334</words> Mira returned it to its hiding spot, knowing that someday another caretaker would find it and understand. <words>351</words> Until then, she would continue her patient rebellion, writing futures where the sacred survived disguised as science. <words>368</words>

The bats dispersed into probability space as stars emerged—not the burning gases everyone believed, but punctuation marks in the universe's ongoing prayer. <words>391</words> Mira smiled her secret smile and resumed sweeping, each stroke a brushstroke painting tomorrow's hidden monasteries into being. <words>409</words>
