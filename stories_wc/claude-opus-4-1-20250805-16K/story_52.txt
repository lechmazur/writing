Marcus's nimble fingers paused mid-reach toward the merchant's purse, arrested by the sight of her broken pencil sharpener tumbling from her apron pocket. <words>20</words>

In this time-worn marketplace suspended inside a giant hourglass, where sand eternally trickled past vendor stalls selling memories and regrets, that mundane object shouldn't have mattered. <words>46</words>

But Marcus recognized it—the same sharpener his mother had carried before she'd vanished into the sand-streams, leaving only chalk lines on the sidewalk that were already fading when he'd found them. <words>77</words>

The merchant, an elderly woman with knowing eyes, caught his wrist gently. <words>89</words>

"You have her fingers," she whispered, and Marcus's chest tightened. <words>99</words>

The depths of devotion he'd buried erupted—not to thievery, but to finding any trace of the woman who'd taught him to survive these curved glass walls where time meant nothing and everything. <words>131</words>

"Sing with me," the merchant commanded, pulling him toward the market's center stage where condemned souls performed for forgotten coins. <words>151</words>

Marcus resisted, but she began anyway, her voice cracking through an old lullaby that materialized his mother's ghost-image in the falling sand—translucent, reaching, mouthing words he couldn't hear. <words>179</words>

His own voice joined hers in spontaneous karaoke duet, tastefully offensive lyrics about merchants who "sold their daughters for copper and sons for bread," a song his mother had invented to make him laugh while teaching him which pockets held kindness and which held cruelty. <words>224</words>

The marketplace froze, even the hourglass sand hovering mid-fall, as their harmony unveiled the secret that seared his soul: his mother hadn't abandoned him. <words>248</words>

She'd traded her physical form to become the marketplace's guardian spirit, protecting young pickpockets from the hourglass's temporal appetite that consumed those who stayed too long without purpose. <words>275</words>

Every chalk line she'd drawn had been a ward, every fading mark a blessing dissolving into protection. <words>292</words>

The merchant—his grandmother, he realized now—pressed the broken sharpener into his palm. <words>304</words>

"She sharpened hope itself with this, boy, grinding it fine enough to slip into desperate pockets." <words>320</words>

Marcus felt his fingers tingle with new understanding; he wasn't just a pickpocket but an heir to something holier. <words>339</words>

His blithe discontent, that careful armor of detachment he'd worn, cracked like old paint. <words>353</words>

The sand resumed falling, but slower now, and his mother's image solidified just enough for her fingertips to brush his cheek before dissolving into golden motes that settled in his pockets. <words>384</words>

He understood his inheritance: not to take, but to plant hope in empty pockets, even if it meant becoming sand himself someday. <words>406</words>

The broken sharpener pulsed warm in his hand, ready to grind new blessings from the chalk of devotion. <words>424</words>
