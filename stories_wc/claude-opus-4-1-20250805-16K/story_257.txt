Sophia wiped down the tavern's grimy tables, her doctorate in folklore studies worth less than the tips stuffed in her apron, though her mind wandered through centuries of unwritten stories. <words>29</words> Outside, the first dried leaves of autumn spiraled down to kiss the cobblestones, marking the exact moment when the mysterious fireflies would return—according to village tradition, anyway. <words>56</words> She'd stopped believing in the annual phenomenon three years ago, when the glowing swarm failed to appear, taking with it the town's tourist revenue and her academic dreams. <words>84</words> 

Behind the bar hung a half-erased chalkboard piece she'd salvaged from the university that had laid her off, its faded equations now serving as backdrop for daily specials. <words>112</words> But Sophia had been secretly reinventing its purpose, using the remaining chalk dust to trace connections between the battered postcards she collected from thrift shops each morning. <words>139</words> Each yellowed card held fragments of strangers' lives—"Wish you were here," "The lights were incredible," "You wouldn't believe what we saw"—all pointing to places where unexplained luminescence had once danced. <words>170</words>

Her intellectually dreamy nature had always made her an outsider among pragmatic villagers who simply accepted that fireflies came or didn't, tradition or not. <words>194</words> Tonight, however, she'd mapped seventeen postcards' origins onto the chalkboard's ghost mathematics, discovering a pattern everyone had missed. <words>212</words> The fireflies hadn't abandoned them; they'd been following an ancient migration route that the village's expanding development had disrupted. <words>231</words>

"Another round!" shouted a customer, but Sophia was already untying her apron. <words>243</words> She grabbed the chalk piece and her box of postcards, moving with bruised exhilaration toward the door. <words>260</words> The mayor would rage about breaking the sacred tradition of waiting passively in the square, but Sophia knew better now. <words>280</words> 

She ran to the abandoned mill pond two miles outside town, where her postcards suggested the swarm had been gathering, confused and circling. <words>303</words> There, she crushed the chalk between her palms and cast the dust skyward, watching it catch the wind like a signal flare. <words>325</words> The air shimmered, trembled, then erupted in golden-green light as thousands of fireflies rose from the reeds, their glow reflecting off her tears. <words>348</words> 

She'd spent months collecting evidence that others had discarded as worthless nostalgia, but those battered postcards had restored her faith—not in tradition, but in the power of looking deeper. <words>377</words> As the swarm spiraled toward the village, following her chalk-dust trail, Sophia smiled at the thought of tomorrow's headlines. <words>396</words> The overqualified waitress had saved their festival by breaking every rule about how things had always been done. <words>414</words> Sometimes faith needed reinvention, not repetition. <words>420</words>
