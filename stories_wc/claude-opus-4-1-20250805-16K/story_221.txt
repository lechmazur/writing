Marina pressed the amber pendant against her chest, feeling the trapped mosquito's ancient stillness mirror her own frozen heart. <words>17</words> She stood in the abandoned carnival's shooting gallery, where her family had gathered every October before the accident claimed them all. <words>37</words> The rusted targets hung askew, their painted cowboys and outlaws peeling like memories she couldn't quite release. <words>54</words>

As a wreck-diver, she'd spent years searching sunken vessels for treasures, but the real ghosts weren't underwater—they whispered here, between carnival prizes nobody won. <words>79</words> Her grandmother's voice drifted through dust motes: "Marina, stop hiding in other people's tragedies." <words>93</words>

She unfolded the letter she'd started writing to her therapist, its half-formed sentences bleeding ink from pocket condensation. <words>111</words> "I dive wrecks because the dead below don't expect me to—" the line ended there, unfinished like everything else. <words>130</words>

The amber caught October light streaming through bullet holes in the gallery's tin roof. <words>144</words> Her father had won it here, forty years ago, shooting every target perfectly while her mother laughed. <words>161</words> Now their voices layered with others, a joyfully melancholic chorus only she could hear. <words>175</words>

"Step forward," her brother's ghost urged, his words arousing something long dormant within her chest. <words>190</words> "You're not betraying us by living." <words>196</words>

Marina lifted a forgotten rifle from the counter, its weight familiar as grief. <words>209</words> She'd been living in their shadow, diving to shipwrecks where strangers' ghosts felt safer than her own family's expectations. <words>228</words> But here, in this place of their tradition, she felt her frozen heart beginning its slow, painful thaw. <words>246</words>

She aimed at the spinning wheel target, still functional despite decades of neglect. <words>259</words> The first shot went wide—a fleeting rebellion against the perfection they'd always achieved together. <words>274</words> The second shot, too, deliberately missed. <words>280</words> With each trigger pull, she wrote the rest of her letter in gunpowder and decision: she would stop diving into darkness, stop listening to the underwater dead. <words>307</words>

The amber mosquito had waited millions of years in tree resin, suspended between life and death. <words>323</words> Marina understood now—she'd been choosing the same suspension, neither fully grieving nor fully living. <words>337</words>

"We're already free," her mother's voice whispered as Marina set down the rifle. <words>350</words> "It's your turn." <words>353</words>

She tucked the letter back in her pocket, knowing she'd finish it tonight. <words>366</words> Tomorrow, she'd sell her diving equipment. <words>372</words> The ghosts would always whisper, but she didn't have to follow them down anymore. <words>386</words> Walking through the gallery's broken door, Marina felt October sun warm her face, the amber pendant pulsing against her thawing heart. <words>407</words>
