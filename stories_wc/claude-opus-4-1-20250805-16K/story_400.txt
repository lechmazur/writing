The last druid on Earth fastened her cloak with a dull safety pin, the metal worn smooth by centuries of use. <words>20</words> She stood at the edge of the glacial orchard, where crystallized apple trees hung suspended over a crevasse of endless blue ice. <words>40</words> It had been exactly three hundred years since the last human—besides herself—had set foot on Earth, and today was her thousandth birthday. <words>63</words>

She was fiercely ambivalent about breaking the silence. <words>71</words> For centuries, she'd kept her vow of wordlessness, speaking only to the frozen trees and the wind that whistled through the ice-locked branches. <words>95</words> But tradition demanded she gather the ingredients for the sacred birthday meal her mother had taught her—fermented ice-apples, frost-moss bread, and glacial honey that took decades to crystallize. <words>124</words> The recipe required spoken incantations, words she'd sworn never to utter again after humanity's exodus. <words>140</words>

Her fear of sound had grown monstrous over the silent centuries. <words>151</words> Even her footsteps on the suspended wooden bridges between trees made her flinch. <words>165</words> The safety pin at her throat had once held a bell, but she'd removed it the day the last ship departed, leaving her as Earth's reluctant guardian. <words>193</words>

She gathered the ice-apples first, their surfaces reflecting her weathered face with dour amusement—as if the universe enjoyed this cosmic joke. <words>214</words> A druid who feared her own voice, keeper of words that could heal the poisoned world, yet too terrified to speak them. <words>237</words> The apples clinked like glass in her basket. <words>245</words>

Standing before the ancient preparation stone, she arranged the ingredients in the pattern her mother had shown her nine centuries ago. <words>267</words> The birthday meal wasn't just tradition—it was the key to Earth's revival, requiring a sung recipe passed through generations of druids. <words>289</words> Her throat constricted. <words>292</words>

She touched the safety pin, remembering how her mother had worn it, how it had held back her hair during this same ritual. <words>316</words> The metal was warm despite the perpetual cold. <words>324</words> Below, the crevasse yawned impossibly deep, holding the frozen seeds of a billion species, waiting for a druid's voice to wake them. <words>347</words>

Her laugh emerged first—harsh, rusty, absurd. <words>353</words> Then, trembling, she began the incantation, her voice cracking like ice in spring. <words>367</words> Each word fell into the crevasse, echoing and multiplying, breaking three hundred years of silence with ancient recipes and older magic. <words>389</words> The frozen orchard began to hum, resonating with her chanted ingredients. <words>400</words> Fear and duty wrestled in her chest as she sang louder, the safety pin gleaming dully against her throat, holding together more than just fabric—holding together the courage to speak Earth back to life. <words>434</words>
