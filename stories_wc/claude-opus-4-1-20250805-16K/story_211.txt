Lucky Jack shuffled into the abandoned schoolhouse, his botanical diary clutched against his chest like a winning hand. <words>16</words> The year was 2087, though nobody remembered calendars anymore—time had become as forgotten as the ghost town of Prosperity Falls itself. <words>36</words>

"Welcome, welcome!" chirped the Mayor, a skeletal woman whose cheerfulness felt painted over something darker. <words>51</words> Six others sat in a circle on the dusty floor, each clutching their own botanical diary—the mandatory record of every citizen's thoughts, disguised as innocent nature observations. <words>78</words>

Jack typically never joined these gatherings, but the Mayor's new decree demanded it: weekly spin-the-bottle confessions, where citizens would duplicate their diary entries aloud, creating perfect copies of their innermost rebellions for the Council's archives. <words>114</words>

"Isn't this delightful?" the Mayor beamed, her smile sharp as broken glass. <words>126</words> "Sharing builds community!" <words>129</words>

The bottle spun, its hollow scrape against wood echoing through empty hallways where children once learned arithmetic instead of obedience. <words>149</words> It pointed to Old Martha, who read with trembling voice: "Today I saw a dandelion growing through concrete. <words>167</words> I did not report it for immediate removal." <words>175</words>

Everyone applauded mechanically while the Mayor's assistant duplicated her words into the master ledger. <words>189</words>

Jack's turn arrived like a rigged game he couldn't lose. <words>199</words> He opened his diary to a random page, knowing his legendary luck would choose the right words. <words>216</words> "Yesterday I discovered a rose," he read, his voice dancing between hope and resignation. <words>230</words> "It grew wild, without permits, without the Council's blessing. <words>239</words> Its thorns drew blood, but its beauty made me remember what we've forgotten—that some things should exist simply because they can, not because they're allowed." <words>264</words>

The Mayor's smile flickered. <words>268</words> "How wonderfully... interpretive." <words>271</words>

But Jack wasn't finished. <words>275</words> His luck had always been about knowing when to push. <words>285</words> "I planted its seeds throughout the town. <words>292</words> By next spring, Prosperity Falls will bloom whether the Council approves or not." <words>305</words>

"That's vandalism," the Mayor said, her cheer cracking like drought-struck earth. <words>316</words>

"That's hope," Jack countered, watching the others' eyes spark with something they'd forgotten they could feel. <words>332</words>

The Mayor stood, her power suddenly seeming as abandoned as the schoolhouse itself. <words>345</words> "The Council will—" <words>348</words>

"The Council will find roses growing from every corner of their perfect dystopia," Jack interrupted, his gambler's grin spreading. <words>367</words> "I've been planting for months. <words>372</words> Every confession you've duplicated contains coordinates hidden in the botanical descriptions." <words>382</words>

Around the circle, suppressed smiles bloomed like secret flowers. <words>391</words> The corruption of power had met its match in Lucky Jack's cheerful defiance, proving that sometimes the house doesn't always win. <words>412</words>

The Mayor's assistant slowly closed the master ledger, choosing—for once—not to duplicate anything at all. <words>427</words>
