The abandoned log flume creaked beneath Chef Margot's boots as she arranged mismatched plates along the waterless channel, her movements precise despite trembling hands. <words>20</words> Interdimensional travelers would arrive soon—beings from seventeen fractured realities, each faction convinced the others had destroyed their shared cradle of hope. <words>42</words>

She'd found them by accident three months ago at the street fair, their portals flickering between vendor stalls like heat mirages. <words>63</words> They'd been searching for something, someone, and when they tasted her grandmother's soup recipe, they wept—all of them, despite their different forms. <words>87</words> The flavor transcended dimensions, they said, reminding them of home before the wars. <words>100</words>

Now the haunted amusement park served as neutral ground, its supernatural residents keeping their presence audibly muted, understanding the delicate nature of tonight's gathering. <words>124</words> Ghost children pressed silent faces against broken funhouse mirrors while phantom carousel horses stood motionless, their screams swallowed. <words>143</words>

Margot placed the out-of-tune music box at the channel's center—a relic from the original world, before it splintered. <words>162</words> Its warped melody played across the hush of long-forgotten lullabies, each note wrong yet achingly familiar. <words>179</words> This was her defiance against fate, against the prophecy that said these factions would remain eternal enemies. <words>197</words>

The first portal opened with a whisper. <words>204</words> A crystalline being emerged, then a shadow-wrapped humanoid, then something that existed only as shifting geometric patterns. <words>221</words> More followed—warriors, scholars, children—filling the log flume's seats as if preparing for a ride that would never come. <words>240</words>

Margot served in reverent silence: bread that tasted like childhood mornings, stew that held the warmth of shared fires, pastries dusted with memories of celebrations before the breaking. <words>269</words> Each dish carefully crafted to remind without accusing, to heal without forcing. <words>281</words>

The music box stuttered through its broken song, and slowly, tentatively, voices began humming along—different octaves, different rhythms, but the same melody buried beneath centuries of separation. <words>308</words> A scaled hand reached for a feathered appendage. <words>316</words> Luminous eyes met void-dark ones with recognition instead of hatred. <words>326</words>

"The cradle wasn't a place," whispered the eldest among them, her form shifting between states of matter. <words>343</words> "It was this—us, together, sharing sustenance." <words>349</words>

The park's ghosts materialized slightly, drawn by the moment's gravity, their presence adding ethereal harmonies to the growing song. <words>368</words> The log flume's ancient machinery groaned to life, water beginning to flow—not from pipes, but from tears of reconciliation. <words>388</words>

Margot stood at the loading platform, watching seventeen realities begin to weave back together over empty plates and full hearts, her quiet revolution complete. <words>412</words> The music box played on, perfectly imperfect, a broken thing that had helped mend the unmendable. <words>428</words> Tomorrow, the real work would begin, but tonight, in this haunted place of joy turned sorrow turned hope, they were home. <words>450</words>
