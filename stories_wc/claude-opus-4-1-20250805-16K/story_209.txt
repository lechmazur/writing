Marcus had spent forty years mapping abandoned railways through dense forests, but nothing prepared him for the radio wave garden sprouting from the old Clearwater junction. <words>20</words> Electromagnetic tendrils writhed through the air like invisible vines, their frequencies painting aurora patterns only his modified scanner could detect. <words>38</words> The seasoned woodsman's artfully messy beard caught dewdrops as he crouched, examining where nature had reclaimed technology in ways that defied understanding. <words>60</words>

His grandmother's antique hairbrush weighed heavy in his pocket—the silver backing concealed a frequency modulator he'd installed after discovering its bristles resonated at precisely 47.3 MHz. <words>86</words> She'd died yesterday, and during the final beep of her hospital monitor, she'd whispered the truth about this place. <words>105</words> "The railways weren't abandoned, Marcus. We hid them." <words>113</words>

He laughed bitterly, a sound of despairing cheer that echoed off rusted rails twisting skyward like metal prayers. <words>130</words> For decades, he'd believed he was preserving history, but he'd been chasing ghosts deliberately laid to mislead him. <words>148</words> The radio waves here grew from seeds planted by his own family, guardians of transportation routes that moved something far stranger than cargo. <words>172</words>

The water tower loomed ahead, its corroded ladder singing in harmonics that made his teeth ache. <words>188</words> Inside, he pulled out the hairbrush and swept it through the electromagnetic field, watching his scanner's display cascade with hidden data. <words>209</words> By measuring the echo in the abandoned water tower's chamber, he could triangulate the true railway network beneath the false one he'd spent his life documenting. <words>235</words>

Each sweep of the brush through charged air revealed another layer of deception, another lie carefully maintained by generations. <words>254</words> His grandmother had wanted him freed by honesty, even if that honesty arrived wrapped in her dying breath. <words>272</words>

The scanner began to short-circuit, its circuits overwhelmed by the intensity of revealed truth. <words>286</words> Sparks danced between the hairbrush bristles and the tower's metal walls, creating a map of light that burned itself into his retinas. <words>308</words> He saw it all—the real railways pulsing beneath the earth, carrying frequencies rather than trains, connecting radio wave gardens planted at every junction across the continent. <words>335</words>

Marcus stumbled outside, his artfully messy appearance now genuinely disheveled, his life's work revealed as an elaborate misdirection. <words>352</words> Yet within the despair, a strange cheer bubbled up. <words>361</words> He finally understood why the old maps never quite aligned, why some routes seemed to vanish into solid rock. <words>380</words> His grandmother had freed him from a lifetime of beautiful lies, leaving him with an ugly truth that somehow felt more precious. <words>402</words> The real mapping could begin now, honest and terrible and absolutely necessary. <words>414</words> He gripped the hairbrush tighter and walked back into the crackling garden, ready to chart what had always been hidden. <words>433</words>
