The old record player wheezed its final note, vinyl scratching against dead air as Zara watched from the wasteland orchard's twisted apple trees. <words>22</words> Radioactive dust storms had turned the world gray, but here, amid the contamination, fruit still grew—poisonous perhaps, but defiantly colorful. <words>42</words> The headstrong mage clutched the stained glass box against her chest, its rainbow fragments the only other splash of vibrancy for miles. <words>65</words> 

She'd hidden here for three years, pretending to be someone else, someone harder. <words>79</words> The glitter residue on her fingers sparkled—remnants from the costume she'd worn before the bombs, when she'd danced in sequined gowns at underground clubs. <words>104</words> Back then, presenting as male had been survival of a different sort. <words>116</words> Now, in this broken world, what did it matter? <words>125</words>

"Confession time," she muttered with merry bitterness, laughing at the absurdity of finding courage here, at civilization's end. <words>143</words> The box contained her hormone treatments, preserved through magic and sheer will, enough to complete what she'd started. <words>161</words> She was tenuously certain this was right—had always been certain, really, just too frightened before. <words>177</words> 

The orchard had taught her something: even in devastation, things insisted on blooming. <words>190</words> The trees fed on radiation and transformed it into twisted beauty. <words>201</words> Why couldn't she? <words>204</words>

She opened the stained glass box, watching colors dance across her skin through the translucent panels. <words>220</words> The vials inside glowed softly, their contents precious beyond measure in this colorless wasteland. <words>234</words> Each injection would feminize her body further, completing the journey the glitter on her fingers remembered—those nights when she'd been truly herself, sparkling and free. <words>259</words>

"To bring color back to a gray world," she toasted the dead sky, injecting the first dose. <words>277</words> The irony wasn't lost on her: she'd survived nuclear winter only to finally transition in a radioactive garden. <words>295</words> But perhaps that was perfect. <words>300</words> 

The orchard whispered through mutated leaves as she worked her magic, weaving protection spells around the remaining treatments. <words>318</words> Each spell sparkled with residual glitter, tiny stars of her former life blessing this new beginning. <words>334</words> She'd been headstrong enough to survive the apocalypse; surely she could be brave enough to live authentically in whatever came next. <words>356</words>

Tomorrow, she'd venture beyond the orchard, carrying her stained glass box like a beacon. <words>370</words> Other survivors needed to know: even here, even now, transformation was possible. <words>382</words> The world had ended, yes, but that just meant they could build something better, something more honest. <words>399</words> She touched the glitter on her fingers one more time, remembering who she'd always been underneath, and stepped forward into her truth. <words>422</words>
