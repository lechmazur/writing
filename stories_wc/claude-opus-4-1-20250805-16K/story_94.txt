Dr. Valentina Cross adjusted her amber earrings—relics from a timeline where she'd loved without calculation—and watched her next client approach the sky reflection pool. <words>22</words> The pool, carved into the rooftop of her practice, mirrored clouds with such precision that visitors often forgot which way was up. <words>42</words> After the invention of time travel, heartbreak had become infinitely more complex; people mourned lovers from futures that might never exist, grieved relationships they'd deliberately erased. <words>67</words>

"You're restlessly curious about everyone except yourself," Valentina observed, her voice silk wrapped around broken glass. <words>83</words> The client, a temporal engineer named Marcus, had been tracking cloud trails for weeks, believing they held patterns that would lead him back to a deleted timeline where his partner still existed. <words>115</words>

"The gravity of desires," Valentina continued, circling him with practiced danger, "pulls us into orbits we can't escape." <words>133</words> She'd built her reputation as a femme fatale heartbreak counselor not through gentle healing, but by showing clients the beautiful destruction of their own illusions. <words>158</words>

Marcus watched her reflection in the pool below, or was it above? <words>170</words> "I just need to find the right temporal coordinate," he insisted. <words>181</words>

"You zip through timelines like a tourist," she said, her amber earrings catching light from both sun and reflected sky. <words>201</words> "But you're searching for something that was never real." <words>210</words>

She'd learned this truth the hard way, having once traveled back to save her own doomed romance seventeen times. <words>229</words> Each iteration had taught her that love was the ultimate cage of illusions—beautiful, intricate, and completely self-imposed. <words>247</words>

"Watch," Valentina commanded, pointing to the cloud trails Marcus had been obsessing over. <words>260</words> They moved with cautious impulsiveness across the reflected sky, forming and reforming, never quite committed to any shape. <words>278</words> "Even clouds know better than to hold onto their forms." <words>288</words>

Marcus stared at the patterns, finally seeing what she meant. <words>298</words> The trails weren't leading anywhere; they were simply being, moment by moment, free from the weight of permanence. <words>316</words>

"Your partner exists in every timeline where you stop searching," Valentina whispered, her reflection multiplying in the pool's ripples. <words>335</words> "The gravity of desires only has power when you believe you're falling." <words>347</words>

As Marcus wept—finally, truly wept—Valentina touched her amber earrings again. <words>357</words> They pulsed with warmth from a love she'd murdered across seventeen timelines to proclaim herself free. <words>373</words> She'd become an expert at breaking hearts because she'd perfected the art on her own. <words>389</words>

The sky reflection pool held them both, suspended between earth and heaven, between holding on and letting go. <words>407</words> In this moment after time travel's invention, all heartbreaks existed simultaneously—past, present, and future collapsing into one exquisite, liberating pain. <words>428</words>

Marcus stood, understanding at last. <words>433</words> Sometimes the only way to proclaim yourself free in a cage of illusions is to stop believing in the cage. <words>453</words>
