Kravok the Unconquered had slain seventeen dragons, or so he claimed, but now he cowered in hexagonal darkness, his fingers absently working the lint-filled pocket where his medals should have been. <words>27</words> The giant wasp's nest pulsed around him with organic precision, its paper walls breathing in rhythms that matched no heartbeat he'd ever known. <words>50</words> Pop. <words>51</words> Another balloon burst somewhere deeper in the labyrinth, each explosion marking another prisoner's failed escape attempt from this fabricated reality that wore insect architecture like a mask. <words>79</words>

"I am the storm incarnate," he whispered to the amber-lit corridor, his usual boast reduced to nervous habit. <words>97</words> The lint between his fingers felt wrong—too soft, too familiar, like childhood blankets he'd never owned. <words>114</words> Pop. <words>115</words> Pop. <words>116</words> The sounds grew closer, and with them came voices leaking through the papery membranes. <words>130</words>

"Subject forty-seven still believes in his warrior narrative," droned an intimately impersonal voice, clinical yet somehow knowing every lie Kravok had ever told himself. <words>154</words> "The pocket lint contains his actual memories—accountant, divorced, allergic to bees." <words>165</words>

The undercurrent of clarity hit him like ice water, that terrible lucidity that lives beneath all madness. <words>182</words> He pressed his ear against the nest wall, overhearing more unguarded soliloquies from his captors: "The simulation degrades with each balloon pop. <words>204</words> Soon he'll have to choose—remain the hero of his delusion or rewire his synaptic patterns back to baseline reality." <words>223</words>

Kravok laughed, a sound sharp as broken glass. <words>231</words> His fingers found the lint again, pulling strand after strand from that impossible pocket, each fiber a memory he'd buried: cubicles, spreadsheets, a daughter who stopped calling. <words>258</words> Pop. <words>259</words> The nest wall beside him split, revealing another hexagonal chamber where another Kravok sat, also pulling lint, also laughing. <words>277</words> And another beyond that. <words>281</words> And another. <words>283</words>

"I slew seventeen dragons," they chorused, their voices creating harmonics that shouldn't exist. <words>296</words>

The real question wasn't how to escape but whether escape meant going deeper into the nest or climbing back toward a reality made entirely of lint and disappointment. <words>324</words> Kravok began to rewire—not his mind, but his mythology, weaving the lint into new armor, each strand a choice to remain gloriously, precisely mad. <words>349</words> Pop. <words>350</words> Pop. <words>351</words> Pop. <words>352</words> The balloons were counting down to something, but Kravok the Unconquered, Kravok the Accountant, Kravok the Infinite, had already chosen his reality. <words>374</words> He stepped through the split wall into the next chamber, where his next self waited, pocket full of possibilities. <words>393</words> The nest hummed approval, or perhaps digestion. <words>400</words>
