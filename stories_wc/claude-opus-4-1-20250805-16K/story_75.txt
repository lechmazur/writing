The nano-forest hummed with engineered life, each tree no taller than Lyra's knee, yet perfectly formed in their genetic rebellion against extinction. <words>23</words> She crouched among them, her lute silent across her back, fingers tracing the plain plastic bookmark she'd carried for seven years. <words>44</words> It marked nothing now—just a relic from before the Movement taught her that grassroots change grew from the soil up, like these tiny oaks. <words>69</words> 

Lyra was skeptically credulous by nature, doubting every promise while believing every dream, which made her perfect for decrypting the old world's lies. <words>93</words> The elders called her their guarded minstrel, singing revolution's songs while keeping her own heart locked behind melodies no one else could hear. <words>117</words> She'd come here to learn the extinct crafts—not just music, but the ancient art of reading between lines that powerful people wrote. <words>140</words>

The bookmark had once held her place in Marcus's journal, back when they'd planned their wedding in this very grove before it shrank. <words>164</words> Before the bio-corporations miniaturized everything beautiful, selling pocket forests while real trees burned. <words>177</words> Before Marcus chose their side. <words>182</words>

Now she pressed the bookmark's edge against the diary's final page, watching heat-sensitive ink bloom across paper like spreading moss. <words>203</words> Marcus had hidden their vows here, encrypted in chemical poetry that only her bookmark's polymer could reveal—vows for a wedding that never happened. <words>227</words> Each word surfaced with molecular precision: "I promise to guard the old songs," "I swear to protect what they call obsolete." <words>249</words> 

But the last vow made her breath catch: "I betray this oath to save you from my father's corporation." <words>269</words>

The angry peace that filled her was familiar—rage compressed into diamond-hard resolve. <words>281</words> She understood now why Marcus had vanished, why the Movement found her bookmark at their door with coordinates to this place. <words>303</words> He'd chosen to disown everything—his inheritance, his father, even her—to protect the grassroots revolution they'd built together in secret. <words>323</words>

Lyra stood, her fingers steady as she tucked the bookmark back into her pocket. <words>338</words> The nano-forest whispered with a thousand tiny leaves, each one a testament to their success in preserving what the world deemed worthless. <words>361</words> Tomorrow she would sing in the underground halls where extinct crafts lived on through careful hands and patient teaching. <words>380</words> She would sing of sacrifice and stubborn hope, of love that chose the greater good over itself. <words>398</words> The bookmark would mark new pages now—recipes for forgotten dyes, instructions for silent looms, sheet music for songs the world claimed never existed. <words>422</words> 

Her guarded heart cracked just enough to let the tiny forest's light seep through. <words>437</words> Marcus had given her the greatest wedding gift possible: proof that some vows transcend the ceremonies that never hold them. <words>457</words>
