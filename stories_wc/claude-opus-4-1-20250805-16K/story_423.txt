Sir Aldric stood beneath the ruined aqueduct, its stone arches casting shadows across the arid desert between the mountain passes where he'd traveled for weeks. <words>25</words> The earnest knight clutched his grandmother's astronomical map, its parchment edges worn from years of her stargazing before the great freeze claimed their homeland. <words>49</words> 

Ahead, a rundown greenhouse emerged from the sand like a skeleton of glass and iron, unknowingly familiar in the way forgotten dreams sometimes surface. <words>74</words> He'd seen this structure before—not here, but sketched in the margins of his grandmother's journals, drawn when these lands still bloomed. <words>96</words>

Inside, desert wind whistled through tears in the roof, creating patterns of light that danced across the dusty floor. <words>116</words> Aldric spread the astronomical map on a broken potting bench, then looked up through the damaged ceiling. <words>133</words> The tears weren't random—they formed constellations, deliberate holes that someone had carved to mirror the night sky. <words>150</words>

With charcoal from his pack, he began mapping the tears, overlaying their positions onto his grandmother's chart. <words>167</words> Each mark revealed coordinates, star positions that aligned with ancient solstice points when properly calculated. <words>182</words> His hands trembled as understanding dawned: this greenhouse was an observatory, disguised as a place for growing things. <words>201</words>

The final tear he mapped would trigger what his grandmother had hidden here—the location of the Eternal Flame, buried beneath centuries of sand. <words>225</words> She'd known the ice would come to their northern kingdom, had prepared this refuge in the desert where heat still lived in the earth's bones. <words>251</words>

Aldric followed the coordinates outside, pacing exact distances from the greenhouse corner. <words>263</words> There, beneath a seemingly ordinary stone, he found the sealed chamber containing brass vessels of preserved fire-oil and flint mechanisms that had waited decades. <words>287</words> The canvas of life stretched before him—not mere survival, but the careful planning across generations, grandmother to grandson, cold to heat, death to rebirth. <words>312</words>

He thought of home, where children huddled in frozen halls, where hearths sat black and empty. <words>328</words> The oil would burn even on ice, the old texts promised, hot enough to melt glaciers, to spark flames that would spread from house to house until warmth returned. <words>358</words>

Standing in the desert heat, Aldric felt crisp nostalgia for winter mornings when his grandmother would point at stars through frosted windows, teaching him to read the sky's endless story. <words>388</words> She'd planted this seed of hope in two places—the ice-locked north where it was needed, and this scorched crossing where it waited to be found. <words>414</words>

Tomorrow, he would begin the journey home, carrying fire across the canvas of life she'd painted with her foresight. <words>433</words>
