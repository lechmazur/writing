Ranger Mika patrolled the urban orchard with meticulous fervor, her boots clicking against the repurposed highway overpass where apple trees now grew through cracked asphalt. <words>19</words> In the seventeen years since the last human dream was dreamt, she'd maintained perfect order among the chaos of rewilding concrete. <words>39</words> Her grandmother's plain notebook, discovered that morning beneath tangled roots, changed everything. <words>51</words>

The handwriting was familiarly unknown—definitely her grandmother's careful script, yet forming words in patterns that shouldn't exist. <words>68</words> "The goddess echoes strongest where highways once divided," read the first entry. <words>80</words> Mika's patrol route began to fluctuate wildly as she followed cryptic directions scrawled between pressed flowers and shopping lists. <words>99</words>

Through chance encounters with other survivors picking fruit, she learned her grandmother had been the orchard's secret architect. <words>117</words> "She planted these trees illegally, decades before the Cessation," whispered an old man sorting pears into color-coded piles. <words>135</words> "Said the goddess of forgotten transit ways told her where each seed belonged." <words>148</words>

The notebook's margins overflowed with measurements: distances between lampposts, angles of morning shadows, the precise number of steps from rusted guardrails to bearing trees. <words>172</words> Mika recognized her own obsessive tendencies reflected in her grandmother's chaotic organization system—everything documented, nothing explained. <words>188</words>

Another chance encounter: a child humming frequencies that made the metal bridge supports resonate. <words>202</words> "Your grandmother taught my mother that tune," the child said, pointing to a diagram in the notebook showing sound waves intersecting with root systems. <words>226</words>

As sunset approached, Mika understood. <words>231</words> Her grandmother hadn't just planted an orchard; she'd built an instrument. <words>242</words> Every tree placement, every preserved highway sign, every carefully maintained gap in the concrete formed acoustic chambers. <words>259</words>

The notebook's final entry contained a schedule: "When dreams end, count seventeen years. <words>272</words> Then walk the pattern at dusk. <words>278</words> She will echo." <words>281</words>

Mika's overzealous maintenance had preserved the precise configuration her grandmother designed. <words>292</words> Now, following the notebook's map, she walked a spiraling path through the trees, her footsteps creating rhythms that bounced between steel beams and apple boughs. <words>317</words>

The echo came not as voice but as knowing—the goddess of forgotten transit ways speaking through fruit-sweet air and rusted infrastructure. <words>338</words> Her grandmother's secrets weren't about hiding truth but about preserving it in plain sight, disguised as an overgrown highway, waiting for someone obsessive enough to maintain the pattern. <words>367</words>

Mika clutched the notebook, finally understanding why she'd always felt compelled to preserve this strange space with such desperate precision. <words>387</words> In a world without dreams, her grandmother had built a different kind of vision—one that required an overzealous guardian to keep its chaotic organization intact until the moment of resonance arrived. <words>418</words>
