Margot pressed her quantum entanglement watch band against the ice cavern's luminescent wall, watching reality shimmer in colors she'd never seen before—the colors of the unforeseen, her grandfather had called them. <words>27</words> She hummed the old lullaby he'd taught her, the one about sleeping worlds and waking dreams, analyzing each verse's subtext as her breath crystallized in the subzero air. <words>55</words>

"This is it!" she chirped to the emptiness, her relentless optimism echoing off frozen stalactites. <words>70</words> "The perfect place to rebuild everything!" <words>76</words>

For years, Margot had been the neighborhood's most cheerful doomsday prepper, stockpiling supplies with a smile while neighbors rolled their eyes. <words>97</words> But she hadn't been preparing for destruction—she'd been preparing for creation. <words>108</words> The watch band, inherited from her physicist grandmother, could notify parallel versions of herself across infinite realities. <words>125</words> All she needed was the right resonance frequency, hidden in the lullaby's ancient melody. <words>139</words>

She continued humming, her fingers tracing politely chaotic patterns on the ice—spirals within spirals, each movement deliberate yet seemingly random. <words>159</words> The cavern responded, its walls pulsing with impossible hues: grief-violet, hope-amber, colors that existed between existence itself. <words>177</words>

"Third verse," she whispered, her voice catching. <words>184</words> This was where the lullaby spoke of loss—mothers singing to children who would never wake, worlds that had already ended. <words>205</words> The fractal sorrow of it spread through her chest, each heartbreak containing infinite smaller heartbreaks, recursively descending into depths she'd tried to ignore with her aggressive cheerfulness. <words>233</words>

The watch band began to warm. <words>239</words> At the hush as a candle's flame is pinched—that precise moment between light and darkness—the notification would reach across dimensions. <words>260</words> She'd studied this instant for decades, that breath where hope dies but hasn't yet accepted its death. <words>277</words>

Colors cascaded through the cavern now, each shade a different timeline bleeding through. <words>290</words> In one, she saw herself crying over her grandfather's empty chair. <words>301</words> In another, the world had never learned suffering. <words>309</words> The lullaby's final note hung in the frozen air. <words>318</words>

"Please," she said to all her other selves, her optimism finally, truly honest. <words>332</words> "Let's make something better together." <words>337</words>

The watch band's quantum entanglement activated, notifying infinite Margots across infinite realities. <words>349</words> They all responded at once, their collective will focused on this single point in space-time. <words>365</words> The cavern shattered—not into pieces, but into possibilities. <words>373</words>

As reality reformed around her, Margot smiled through tears that refracted into rainbow prisms. <words>387</words> She'd done it—created a new reality where sorrow and joy existed in perfect, polite chaos, where every ending was also a beginning. <words>410</words> The lullaby echoed eternally now, a gentle notification to all existence that something unprecedented had been born. <words>427</words>
