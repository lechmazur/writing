The cipher decoder's office smelled of stale coffee and stellar dust, where Marina sat knitting constellation patterns into wool while astronomical charts papered every wall. <words>23</words> She'd been hired three weeks ago—long enough to form habits but not long enough to forget why she'd fled the wasteland that used to be home. <words>49</words>

Her fingers moved in practiced isolation, each stitch a meditation that strengthened her mental fortitude against the memories threatening to surface. <words>70</words> The office belonged to Dr. Kepler, who'd found her performing alone in an abandoned theater, dancing to music only she could hear through forgotten echoes of a world before the drought. <words>101</words>

"You move like you're solving equations," he'd said, watching her interpret Bach through movement. <words>115</words> It was illogically logical—how her introverted nature translated into expansive gestures when she danced, how she could express everything while saying nothing. <words>137</words>

Now she decoded messages hidden in star maps while her hands automatically knitted scarves no one would wear. <words>155</words> The work suited her; both activities required pattern recognition, the ability to see connections others missed. <words>171</words> Dr. Kepler had recognized this quality immediately, had seen how her years of choreographing routines in solitude had trained her mind to find meaning in chaos. <words>197</words>

Through the window, she could still see the edge of the wasteland—cracked earth stretching toward a horizon that shimmered with heat even in winter. <words>221</words> She'd danced there once, in the ruins of her childhood studio, until her feet bled and the isolation became unbearable. <words>241</words> The memory arrived softly, filtered through the comfortable distance she'd cultivated, an affectionate detachment that let her acknowledge the past without drowning in it. <words>265</words>

"Found something," she said to the empty room, her voice rusty from disuse. <words>278</words> The astronomical chart revealed coordinates hidden in the declination angles, a message woven through celestial mechanics like yarn through her needles. <words>299</words> She transcribed the numbers while her knitting continued, muscle memory maintaining the rhythm while her conscious mind worked. <words>317</words>

Dr. Kepler would return tomorrow to find her discovery, would praise her unique approach to problem-solving. <words>333</words> But Marina valued something else more—how this strange work had given her purpose, had transformed her exile from the wasteland into something resembling choice. <words>357</words> She'd escaped physically months ago, but only here, surrounded by cosmic mysteries and encrypted messages, had she truly left it behind. <words>378</words>

The needles clicked against each other like a metronome, keeping time with her breathing, with the steady pulse of survival she'd learned to maintain. <words>402</words> Tomorrow she would dance again, alone in the archive room, letting her body translate the patterns she'd found in the stars. <words>424</words> Tonight, she would finish this scarf, adding one more completed pattern to her collection of things that proved she'd endured. <words>444</words> The wasteland couldn't follow her here, into this peculiar sanctuary where her strangest qualities had become her greatest strengths. <words>463</words>
