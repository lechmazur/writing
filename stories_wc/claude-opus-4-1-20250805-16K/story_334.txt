Marcus stood watch at the magnetic field observatory, his fingers absently spinning the brass top that had belonged to his predecessor. <words>21</words> The device wasn't just a toy—it was a quantum compass, calibrated to detect rifts between parallel realities whenever the Earth's magnetic field fluctuated. <words>43</words> As the station's sentinel, Marcus possessed an artificially authentic confidence, a psychological modification required for the job, though beneath it lurked the knowledge that his manufactured bravery was precisely that—manufactured. <words>73</words>

Tonight, the monitors showed familiar patterns, the same oscillations he'd witnessed countless times before, yet something about them felt like déjà vu reversed—a future memory bleeding backward. <words>100</words> The top spun faster in his palm, its hum rising to match the observatory's electromagnetic pulse. <words>116</words> Through the viewing ports, he caught stolen glimpses of parallel realities: versions of himself standing at this same console, some crying, some laughing, one simply gone. <words>142</words>

His conflicting loyalties tore at him—duty to report the anomalies to Command, or his secret mission to steal thunder from the gods of mediocrity who kept humanity blind to the multiverse. <words>173</words> The organization believed in controlled disclosure, parceling out truth in digestible fragments, but Marcus had seen too much through the rifts to accept their glacial pace. <words>200</words>

The spinning top suddenly lifted from his palm, hovering in the charged air. <words>213</words> In seventeen parallel realities, he watched himself reach for the emergency beacon. <words>225</words> In twelve, he destroyed the equipment. <words>231</words> In three, he simply walked away. <words>237</words> But here, in this reality, before the first tear is shed—before the moment when every version of himself would converge on a single, irreversible choice—Marcus did something none of his parallel selves had done. <words>271</words>

He let out an involuntary yelp as the top exploded with light, broadcasting not an alarm but the raw data streams from every parallel observatory simultaneously. <words>297</words> The transmission would reach every receiver on Earth in minutes, unveiling the truth about parallel worlds that governments had hidden for decades. <words>319</words>

His overconfidence, that artificial construct, suddenly felt genuine as he watched the data upload. <words>333</words> Perhaps it had always been real, merely waiting for the right moment to transform from psychological programming into actual courage. <words>353</words> The monitors around him flickered with images of parallel Marcuses, all nodding in approval, their various fates converging on this singular act of rebellion. <words>377</words>

The brass top clattered to the floor, spent. <words>385</words> Marcus picked it up with trembling fingers, knowing that within hours, the world would change forever. <words>401</words> He'd stolen fire from heaven itself, and before dawn broke, before that first tear of joy or terror could fall, humanity would finally see itself reflected in infinite possibilities. <words>430</words>
