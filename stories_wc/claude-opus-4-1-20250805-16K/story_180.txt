The remorseful conjurer stood among dusty tables at another yard sale, fingers tracing the brass curves of an antique microscope. <words>17</words> He'd spent months searching these weekend markets throughout the county, seeking artifacts that might unlock what he'd lost. <words>34</words> The microscope's eyepiece bore a spiral of fingerprints, oxidized green against the metal—a pattern he recognized from dreams. <words>52</words>

"That belonged to my grandmother," the seller mentioned with indifferent enthusiasm, barely glancing up from her crossword. <words>69</words> "She ran the old greenhouse down by the harbor, before the storms." <words>81</words>

The conjurer's chest tightened. <words>85</words> The sunken orchard greenhouse, ringed by shipwrecks from three different centuries, had been his sanctuary once. <words>101</words> Before the accident. <words>104</words> Before his magic turned inward, dampening every spell he attempted, leaving only guilt where power once flowed. <words>121</words>

He pressed his thumb against the eyepiece, matching the swirl of fingerprints precisely. <words>134</words> The brass warmed, and suddenly he could taste salt air, hear waves breaking against rusted hulls. <words>150</words> Shared wisdom flooded through—not his memories, but the greenhouse keeper's, decades of understanding about growth and decay, patience and wildness. <words>171</words>

In his coat pocket, his fingers found the single knitting needle he always carried, its point worn smooth from nervous handling. <words>193</words> It had been his focusing tool, back when focusing mattered. <words>203</words> Now it merely reminded him of unfinished patterns, dropped stitches in reality's fabric. <words>216</words>

"Twenty dollars," the seller said, still absorbed in her puzzle. <words>226</words>

The conjurer paid without haggling and walked toward the harbor, microscope heavy in his hands. <words>241</words> The greenhouse's broken glass teeth still jutted from shallow water, obviously mysterious to tourists who photographed it from shore. <words>260</words> But locals knew better than to wade out there. <words>269</words> Strange things grew in that drowned garden—kelp that whispered, coral that remembered. <words>281</words>

He stood knee-deep in cold tide, pressing the microscope's eyepiece to his eye while gripping the knitting needle like a wand. <words>303</words> Through the lens, magnified droplets of seawater became galaxies, each containing the greenhouse keeper's patient observations of impossible botany. <words>322</words> Her knowledge merged with his damaged gift, teaching him that magic wasn't about control but cultivation. <words>339</words>

The remorse didn't leave—it transformed, becoming compost for something new. <words>349</words> His mind's wild frontier had never truly disappeared; he'd simply been looking at the wrong scale. <words>366</words> The microscope revealed it in every water drop, every grain of sand, every fragment of greenhouse glass. <words>383</words> 

Standing among shipwrecks and shattered windows, the conjurer began to weave again, using the needle to conduct tiny symphonies of growth. <words>404</words> Barnacles bloomed into flowers. <words>408</words> Seaweed braided itself into equations. <words>413</words> The greenhouse keeper's wisdom guided each gesture, proving that some magic works best when shared between the living and the gone. <words>435</words>
