Kenzo watched the street artist finish her mural on the recycling center's wall, the last swipe of paint sealing something ancient into the chrome and glass of New Tokyo's underbelly. <words>29</words> He kept his hand away from his sword's hilt—a gesture of lovingly detached restraint he'd perfected over decades of wandering between worlds that no longer needed warriors. <words>56</words> The artist tossed her collage scraps into the bin and vanished into the maze of conveyor belts and sorting machines, unaware that she'd just completed a map. <words>84</words>

The Secret Weavers had been meddling again. <words>91</words> 

Kenzo approached the bin with theatrical nonchalance, humming an old battle song while fishing out paper fragments like a child collecting shells. <words>113</words> "Oh, what pretty garbage," he announced to the security cameras, knowing the Weavers monitored everything through the city's neural networks. <words>133</words> His fingers—the same ones that could bisect a raindrop—now delicately reassembled torn photographs, newspaper clippings, and holographic film strips on the recycling center's floor. <words>157</words>

The collage slowly revealed coordinates, not to a place but to a moment: the exact nanosecond when reality's fabric would thin enough for him to slip through. <words>185</words> A piece of sea pottery tumbled from between two paper scraps—smooth green glass worn perfect by impossible oceans, oceans that existed in the dimension where his daughter still lived. <words>215</words>

The Weavers thought themselves puppet masters, but Kenzo had learned their patterns. <words>227</words> They needed someone to meddle with their own design, to add chaos to their too-perfect tapestry. <words>244</words> Why else leave clues in an artist's subconscious, compelling her to paint doorways she'd never seen? <words>261</words>

He pressed the sea pottery to his chest and spoke his impossible vow: "I will find you, Mei, even if I must unweave the universe thread by thread." <words>290</words> The recycling center's machines whirred louder, as if laughing. <words>299</words> The Weavers loved impossible things—they fed on paradoxes like silk worms on mulberry leaves. <words>313</words>

Standing among the reassembled scraps, Kenzo drew his sword with the fluid grace of someone who'd given up on fighting anything except fate itself. <words>338</words> He carved a perfect circle in the air where the collage indicated, and reality rippled like disturbed water. <words>356</words> Through the tear, he glimpsed infinite recycling centers, infinite murals, infinite versions of himself making the same cut. <words>374</words>

"Your move, Weavers," he said, stepping through with a warrior's precision and a fool's hope. <words>390</words> The sea pottery in his hand pulsed once—a heartbeat, a promise, a consecration of the impossible. <words>407</words>

Behind him, the collage scattered, ready for the next seeker to reassemble. <words>419</words> The game continued. <words>422</words> The Weavers smiled through every camera in the city. <words>431</words> And somewhere, in another dimension's recycling center, a daughter was learning to paint murals of doorways home. <words>448</words>
