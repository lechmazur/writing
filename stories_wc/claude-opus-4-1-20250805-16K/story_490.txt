The caravan repair station sat empty beneath stars that seemed too bright, as if the universe itself had gorged on darkness after the waves finally receded from what was once civilization's shore. <words>30</words> Mara, the station's fading caretaker, moved through the abandoned bays with methodically random patterns—three steps left, seven forward, two diagonal—a dance she'd learned from hacking ancient archives that whispered of protection rituals. <words>60</words>

She clutched the dried lavender bundle against her chest, its brittle stems crackling like static from forbidden transmissions. <words>78</words> The archives had been clear: accessing the quantum libraries buried beneath drowned cities was punishable by erasure, yet here she was, downloading terabytes of lost knowledge with the enthusiasm of someone filing tax returns. <words>111</words>

"Another exciting evening of treason," she muttered, watching progress bars crawl across her salvaged terminal. <words>126</words> The allure of the forbidden had become routine, each hack as thrilling as folding laundry. <words>141</words> Still, she persisted. <words>144</words>

The lavender wasn't for sentiment—it masked the electromagnetic signature of her equipment from the Authority's sweeper drones. <words>161</words> Practical rebellion, she called it, though the irony wasn't lost on her that she'd become a revolutionary through sheer boredom. <words>181</words>

Data streams poured in: pre-flood literature, music, architectural blueprints of cities now hosting fish. <words>195</words> Each file was a fragment of the world before, and Mara collected them with the detached curiosity of an archaeologist examining someone else's apocalypse. <words>219</words>

Her fingers moved across keyboards with practiced indifference, gorging the station's servers with humanity's ghost stories. <words>235</words> The repair station, once meant to fix vehicles crossing the wasteland, now repaired something else entirely—the broken chain of human memory. <words>257</words>

She'd started this project wanting to cradle the unknown like a newborn galaxy, to nurture possibilities that the Authority had declared dead. <words>279</words> But years of solitary work had worn that romantic notion smooth as beach glass. <words>293</words> Now she simply continued because stopping would require caring enough to make a decision. <words>308</words>

A ping interrupted her downloading—someone approaching. <words>314</words> Mara glanced at the door, then back at her screen with magnificent disinterest. <words>327</words> If they were Authority, she'd be erased. <words>334</words> If they were scavengers, she'd be robbed. <words>341</words> Either outcome seemed equally unremarkable. <words>346</words>

She lit the lavender bundle, watching smoke curl toward ventilation shafts as her methodically random movements resumed. <words>363</words> Three steps left, seven forward, two diagonal—dancing with ghosts of data while the world's newest shore dried under starlight. <words>383</words>

The footsteps stopped outside. <words>387</words> Mara continued typing, downloading one last cluster of files labeled "Children's Lullabies, 2089-2094." <words>400</words> Perhaps whoever entered would understand that revolution sometimes looked like this: a fading woman in an empty station, stealing back the world one forgotten song at a time. <words>428</words>

The door opened. <words>431</words> She didn't look up. <words>435</words> The lavender burned on. <words>439</words>
