Marcus had performed his last saxophone solo outside the automated postal sorting facility every Tuesday for seventeen years, but tonight he stood inside, clutching his father's vintage fountain pen. <words>29</words> The security guard, complexly deceptive in his kindness, had invited him in from the rain, claiming the night shift wouldn't mind. <words>50</words> "Just don't touch anything," he'd winked, disappearing into shadows that hummed with mechanical precision. <words>65</words>

The facility's conveyor belts moved like serpents digesting letters, each package sorted through forgotten patterns that once meant destinations, now just codes in an endless algorithmic dance. <words>93</words> Marcus laughed—a sound caught between joy and despair—recognizing the cosmic absurdity of standing here, where his undelivered love letters to Elena had probably passed through twenty years ago. <words>122</words> The backlash of regrets hit him like feedback from a broken amplifier. <words>134</words>

He'd written those letters with this same fountain pen, each word a note he couldn't play on his saxophone. <words>153</words> Now, watching the sorting machines work their mindless magic, he understood that some messages were meant to travel forever, never arriving. <words>174</words> The humor in it made him dizzy. <words>181</words>

His battered suitcase sat by the door—the one he'd packed that morning, knowing his landlord had changed the locks. <words>200</words> Inside: sheet music, the fountain pen's empty ink cartridges, and a photograph of Elena holding a letter she'd never received. <words>220</words> The suitcase might never reopen; he'd superglued it shut in a moment of inspired madness, sealing his past like a time capsule nobody wanted. <words>245</words>

The sorting machines began to rewind—not physically, but in the way Marcus perceived them, through forgotten patterns of memory overlaying the present. <words>268</words> Each envelope became one he'd written, each package a piece of himself mailed to nowhere. <words>283</words> The facility transformed into a cathedral of lost connections, and Marcus found himself conducting an invisible orchestra with the fountain pen. <words>304</words>

"You composing?" the guard returned, eating a sandwich. <words>312</words>

"Just finding the rhythm in the machinery," Marcus replied, his voice carrying that peculiar brightness of someone who'd discovered freedom in surrender. <words>334</words>

The guard nodded knowingly. <words>338</words> "My wife left me here once—literally drove off while I was working. <words>351</words> Took me three hours to realize the cosmic joke. <words>361</words> We sort everything here except our own lives." <words>369</words>

Marcus wrote one final message in the air with the fountain pen, invisible ink for an invisible future. <words>387</words> Tomorrow he'd play saxophone on a different corner, carrying his sealed suitcase like a talisman against certainty. <words>404</words> Tonight, though, he stood among the sorting machines, finding joy in the perfect despair of letters traveling toward addresses that no longer existed, understanding that sometimes the only response to the universe's indifference was to dance. <words>441</words>
