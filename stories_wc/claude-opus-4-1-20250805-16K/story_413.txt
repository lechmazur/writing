Lord Vethis wandered the endless corn maze that sprawled across the haunted plain, his existence predating the moment when any creature would first glimpse its own reflection and understand. <words>26</words> His faded scarf, woven from the dreams of unborn stars, trailed behind him like a forgotten promise. <words>43</words> For eons uncounted, he had drifted through this labyrinth with the listless grace of one who possessed everything yet desired nothing. <words>64</words>

The invitation arrived not as parchment or whisper, but as a tremor in the stalks themselves. <words>80</words> "Come," they rustled in unison, "to witness what has never been." <words>91</words> Vethis, in his naively sophisticated manner, assumed this meant another tedious celestial alignment or the birth of some unremarkable constellation. <words>111</words>

Yet curiosity, that ancient affliction of nobles with too much time, compelled him toward the rendezvous point at the maze's impossible center. <words>133</words> There, he found her—another wanderer whose name predated language itself. <words>143</words> She stood examining a peculiar sight: two primitive forms, barely more than animated clay, facing each other in the twilight. <words>163</words>

"Watch," she commanded with the authority of one who understood mysteries Vethis had never considered. <words>178</words> The clay beings moved closer, their movements jerky and unpracticed. <words>188</words> One reached out, touched the other's face, and something extraordinary occurred. <words>199</words> Their mouths opened simultaneously, releasing a sound that had never existed before—raw, unfiltered joy bubbling up from somewhere deeper than instinct. <words>221</words>

Laughter. <words>222</words> Shared laughter. <words>224</words>

Vethis felt his eternal ennui crack like ice beneath spring's first warmth. <words>236</words> "What sorcery is this?" he breathed, his sophistication crumbling before genuine wonder. <words>248</words>

"No sorcery," his companion replied, her eyes reflecting the same ironic awe that now consumed him. <words>264</words> "They've discovered intention—the power to choose joy, to create it together from nothing." <words>277</words>

The noble clutched his faded scarf, suddenly understanding its true nature. <words>288</words> It had been woven not from dreams but from all the laughter he'd never shared, all the connections he'd never intended. <words>309</words> These simple beings, lacking consciousness, lacking souls, had stumbled upon something he'd missed across countless ages of existing without purpose. <words>330</words>

As the clay figures continued their primitive dance of discovery, Vethis found himself laughing—truly laughing—for the first time since before time had meaning. <words>353</words> His companion joined him, and their combined mirth echoed through the corn maze, teaching the stalks a new way to move. <words>374</words>

The haunted plain shivered with possibility. <words>380</words> Perhaps sentience would arrive soon, Vethis mused, but these creatures had already discovered something far more precious: the choice to create light in darkness, together. <words>405</words> His listlessness finally had found its cure in witnessing the birth of intentional joy. <words>419</words> The maze stretched endlessly still, but now it seemed less like a prison and more like a garden of infinite beginnings. <words>440</words> Even nobles, apparently, could learn from clay. <words>447</words>
