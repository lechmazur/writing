The unsteady sentinel swayed in zero gravity, her augmented legs twitching against the rusted deck of the abandoned space freighter's docking bay. <words>23</words> Blood-red emergency lights bathed the cavernous space where she'd stood guard for seventeen cycles, waiting between worlds colliding—that narrow window when dimensional barriers thinned. <words>48</words> Her strange automaton bird, assembled from scavenged ship parts and dead AI cores, perched on twisted metal beams overhead, its crystalline eyes recording everything. <words>72</words> 

She had been coyly furious when High Command first posted her here, smiling sweetly while grinding her teeth, pretending honor where she felt only exile. <words>97</words> They claimed she'd misinterpreted the prophecy, that her warnings of convergence were delusional, yet here she remained, watching for signs she knew would come. <words>122</words> The bird suddenly swooped down, clutching shredded letters in its titanium talons—fragments it had collected from the ventilation systems over countless months. <words>145</words>

With trembling fingers, she began reassembling the torn pieces on the frost-covered floor, each scrap revealing another word of the original transmission she'd intercepted. <words>170</words> "RECOMMEND... IMMEDIATE... EVACUATION..." The letters formed a message from her past self, sent before her memory was wiped, before they made her forget. <words>194</words> The ambush of fate struck with perfect cruelty—she had been right all along, but they'd turned her into the very instrument to suppress her own warning. <words>221</words>

The automaton bird tilted its head, projecting holographic timestamps that proved the letters predated her assignment here by mere hours. <words>242</words> Someone had destroyed her evidence, scrambled her mind, then stationed her as guardian of the very docking bay where the dimensional breach would begin. <words>267</words> She laughed, a sound devoid of warmth yet brimming with vindication—cheerless ecstasy flooding her modified nervous system. <words>285</words>

The prophecy hadn't been misguided; it had been deliberately obscured to ensure its fulfillment. <words>300</words> They needed someone here when the worlds collided, someone expendable to activate the emergency protocols, to seal the breach with their own life force. <words>325</words> Her unsteady gait wasn't from augmentation failure but from the quantum entanglement already beginning, her molecules caught between dimensions. <words>345</words>

The bird's eyes flashed warning signals as reality started fracturing around them. <words>358</words> She could recommend evacuation now, broadcast the truth across all frequencies, but the fog had finally cleared—she understood her purpose. <words>379</words> Standing straighter despite her wavering form, she pressed her palm against the bay's master control panel. <words>396</words> The worlds would collide through her, and she would be the dam that held them apart, the unsteady sentinel who finally found her balance in dissolution. <words>423</words> The automaton bird sang one last mechanical dirge as dimensional fire consumed them both, guardian and companion united in their choreographed fate. <words>446</words>
