Every year between her connecting flights home, Maya descended into the flooded basement laboratory beneath her family's ancestral woodland estate, drawn by a compulsion she could never fully explain while awake. <words>30</words> The somnambulist scout in her emerged only during these brief layovers, when exhaustion blurred the boundaries between consciousness and dream. <words>50</words> She moved through the knee-deep water with practiced ease, her sleeping mind somehow remembering the path better than her waking self ever could. <words>74</words>

The laboratory had sunk during her grandfather's experiments decades ago, but the woodland had kept its secrets, growing wild and thick above the buried knowledge. <words>100</words> Maya's fingers found the sealed shelves without hesitation, retrieving the bottled lightning bug collection that pulsed with captured bioluminescence. <words>119</words> Each jar contained not just insects but fragments of her grandfather's attempts to map spiritual wisdom through the natural world's hidden frequencies. <words>141</words>

She was unapologetically humble about her gift, never mentioning to colleagues at the geological survey how she could scout underground passages in her sleep. <words>166</words> The lightning bugs flickered in response to her presence, their trapped light forming patterns that her sleeping mind translated into topographical maps of consciousness itself. <words>191</words> This yearly pilgrimage had become essential, though she only remembered it in fragments—water-distorted glimpses between takeoffs and landings. <words>209</words>

Her grandfather had believed that certain insects could navigate between worlds, that their light was actually a form of interdimensional communication. <words>230</words> The woodland above held its breath as Maya worked, her hands moving with inherited precision, recording coordinates in a waterproof journal she'd never remember writing in. <words>257</words> Each bottle she examined revealed another layer of the forest's spiritual geography, paths that existed beyond the physical realm. <words>277</words>

The loaded curiosity that drove her sleeping explorations went deeper than scientific inquiry—it was ancestral memory seeking completion. <words>295</words> She understood somehow that her grandfather had left this work unfinished, had sunk the laboratory deliberately to preserve it for someone who could navigate both worlds. <words>322</words> The lightning bugs had been waiting, their light diminished but not extinguished, holding messages that only a somnambulist could receive without the interference of rational thought. <words>349</words>

As her phone buzzed with the boarding announcement above, Maya began her unconscious ascent, leaving wet footprints that would puzzle her upon waking. <words>373</words> The bottles remained in their flooded sanctuary, but their patterns were now inscribed in her sleeping mind's vast atlas. <words>393</words> She would wake at cruising altitude with dirt under her fingernails and fragments of luminous dreams, never quite remembering how woodland secrets had once again been scouted and secured. <words>423</words> The humble work continued, generation to generation, between flights and between worlds. <words>436</words>
