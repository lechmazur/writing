Marcus let his fingers dance over the blank price tag, practicing his pitch among the apple trees that grew through the skeletal remains of the forty-second floor. <words>20</words> The toppled Meridian Tower had become an accidental Eden after the Great Collapse, its shattered windows nurturing orchards where boardrooms once schemed. <words>41</words>

He moved with energetic lethargy—quick gestures followed by long, calculated pauses—the trademark rhythm of a swindler who'd learned that rushing breeds suspicion. <words>65</words> Today's mark would arrive soon, drawn by promises of purchasing "development rights" to this vertical farmland. <words>81</words> But Marcus carried a burden heavier than any con: the truth about why the towers fell. <words>97</words>

His invisible allies stirred in the periphery—the ghosts of programmers who'd died trying to expose the Algorithm. <words>114</words> They couldn't speak, couldn't touch, but they could magnetize small objects, drawing them toward moments of significance. <words>131</words> Marcus had learned to read their subtle guidance like braille written in falling leaves. <words>145</words>

The mark appeared right on schedule, a developer named Chen whose frozen computer had just restarted after three hours of the spinning wheel of death. <words>170</words> In that instant of relief, when his screen flickered back to life, Chen had seen Marcus's fabricated listing and impulsively decided to visit. <words>194</words>

"Magnificent property," Marcus began, but the ghosts grew agitated. <words>203</words> A book—"Digital Architecture: A Cautionary Tale"—suddenly dropped from a branch above, landing at Chen's feet. <words>219</words>

"Oh!" Chen exclaimed, bending to retrieve it just as Marcus reached down. <words>231</words> Their hands touched briefly, and Chen looked up, really seeing Marcus for the first time. <words>247</words> "You're trembling," she said softly. <words>252</words>

The blank price tag fluttered from Marcus's pocket, landing between them. <words>263</words> Chen picked it up, understanding dawning in her eyes. <words>272</words> "You're not really selling this place, are you?" <words>280</words>

Marcus felt the ghosts pressing close, their invisible presence making the air shimmer. <words>293</words> "The Algorithm that toppled the towers—it wasn't an accident," he said, his voice carrying gentle harshness. <words>310</words> "Your company wrote it. <words>314</words> The ghosts of the programmers who tried to stop it—they led you here." <words>327</words>

Chen's face went pale, but she didn't run. <words>335</words> "My computer freezing... the restart..." <words>340</words>

"They can affect electronics," Marcus confirmed. <words>346</words> "They've been trying to reach someone with the power to expose this." <words>358</words> He gestured at the reclaimed orchard around them. <words>366</words> "Nature took back what greed destroyed, but the truth remains buried." <words>377</words>

Chen looked at the blank price tag in her hand—no price could restore the dead or undo the collapse. <words>396</words> "Show me everything," she whispered, and Marcus knew his con had become confession, his mark transformed into his salvation. <words>415</words> The invisible allies swirled around them both, finally witnessed, finally heard. <words>426</words>
