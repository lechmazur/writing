Marcus held the empty tape dispenser like a talisman, its plastic weight unusually normal in his calloused hands. <words>16</words> The dystopian farm stretched before him—rows of synthetic corn under a yellowed sky, automated scarecrows humming their surveillance songs. <words>34</words> He'd conned his way past the checkpoint yesterday, claiming to be an agricultural inspector, but now the lull of remorse settled over him like morning fog. <words>60</words>

"Story time," crackled the compound's speakers, and Marcus shuffled toward the communal barn with the other workers. <words>77</words> Inside, children sat cross-legged on hay bales while the Overseer prepared to read from the approved texts. <words>94</words> But Marcus saw what others couldn't—translucent figures hovering near the rafters, ghostly apparitions of the farm's previous owners. <words>112</words>

He'd discovered his gift three cons ago: interrogating these spirits revealed secrets worth more than stolen rations. <words>129</words> The empty tape dispenser had belonged to the farm's original matriarch, Mrs. Chen, whose ghost now drifted closer. <words>147</words> "Why did you keep this?" Marcus whispered, holding it up. <words>157</words>

Mrs. Chen's ethereal form solidified slightly. <words>163</words> "My grandson made labels with it," she murmured, her voice like wind through wheat. <words>178</words> "Named every plant, every tool, everything we loved before the State took it all." <words>193</words>

The Overseer droned on about productivity quotas, but Marcus felt the familiar itch—the need to expose the truth, to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin. <words>220</words> This wasn't just another mark; these people deserved to know their land's history. <words>234</words>

"Tell me more," Marcus urged the ghost, his mild fervor drawing suspicious glances from nearby workers. <words>250</words> Mrs. Chen revealed where the original deed was buried, beneath the third fence post. <words>265</words> Legal ownership predating the State's seizure—information that could comfort an entire community, restore their dignity. <words>280</words>

The remorse that had haunted Marcus transformed into purpose. <words>289</words> He stood, interrupting the Overseer's monotone recitation. <words>296</words> "I have a different story," he announced, the empty dispenser raised high. <words>308</words> "About the Chen family who built this place with their own hands, who labeled their world with love." <words>327</words>

The Overseer reached for his shock baton, but Marcus continued, interrogating Mrs. Chen aloud now, letting her testimony flow through him. <words>349</words> Workers leaned forward, recognizing names, remembering. <words>355</words> The ghostly apparitions multiplied—former farmhands, children, grandparents—all adding their voices to the narrative. <words>369</words>

Security burst through the doors, but Marcus smiled. <words>377</words> He'd already whispered the deed's location to three workers. <words>387</words> His con artist days were ending, but perhaps that had always been the plan—to con himself into becoming something unusually normal: a truth-teller in a world built on lies. <words>417</words> The empty tape dispenser fell from his hands as they dragged him away, but its purpose was complete. <words>436</words> The labels had been restored. <words>441</words>
