The sellsword Grimwald arrived at the witch's herb garden with his usual grin, though his steps betrayed a boldly reluctant gait. <words>18</words> He'd accepted the contract to retrieve Morgantha's astronomical telescope, but the withering vow she'd placed upon it gave him pause. <words>37</words> "Anyone who treasures material things above truth shall wither like autumn leaves," she'd cackled before disappearing into smoke. <words>55</words>

Grimwald surveyed the moonlit garden where wolfsbane tangled with nightshade in elegant mayhem. <words>68</words> The telescope stood among the herbs, its brass gleaming with otherworldly phosphorescence. <words>80</words> He approached it, whistling a tavern tune to dethrone doubt from his mind. <words>93</words>

"Interesting choice of melody," said a voice like crushed velvet. <words>103</words> Morgantha materialized between two rosemary bushes, her eyes glinting with amusement. <words>114</words> "Most thieves prefer silence." <words>118</words>

"Most thieves aren't jovial by nature, milady," Grimwald bowed theatrically. <words>128</words> "Besides, I'm no thief—merely a redistributor of misplaced artifacts." <words>138</words>

She laughed, a sound like breaking crystal. <words>145</words> "The telescope contains my family's memories, sellsword. <words>152</words> Each generation adds their most precious observation to its enchanted lenses before burying it like a time capsule." <words>170</words> She circled him slowly. <words>174</words> "My grandmother watched empires fall through it. <words>181</words> My mother saw the birth of new constellations. <words>189</words> I witnessed the exact moment hope died in my lover's eyes." <words>200</words>

Grimwald's smile faltered. <words>203</words> "And what would I see?" <words>208</words>

"Whatever truth you treasure most but refuse to acknowledge." <words>217</words>

Throughout the transformation that followed, Grimwald felt his certainties crumble. <words>227</words> The moment he touched the telescope, visions flooded through him—not of gold or glory, but of every instance he'd chosen laughter over confronting his loneliness. <words>252</words> His skin began to crack like parchment, the withering vow taking hold. <words>264</words>

"Wait!" <words>265</words> He gasped, understanding blooming. <words>269</words> "The vow—it's not about greed. <words>275</words> It's about treasuring illusions over truth." <words>282</words>

Morgantha nodded approvingly. <words>285</words> "My family tradition isn't just preserving memories in metal and glass. <words>296</words> It's forcing each generation to face themselves completely." <words>304</words> She touched his withering hand, and the transformation reversed. <words>313</words> "You've passed the test, sellsword." <words>318</words>

Grimwald looked through the telescope properly now, seeing not the stars but himself—truly himself—for the first time. <words>335</words> His jovial mask had hidden a profound fear of genuine connection. <words>346</words> "Your payment?" <words>348</words> Morgantha asked. <words>350</words>

He set down the telescope gently among the witch's herbs. <words>360</words> "Keep it for the next seeker," he said, his grin now genuine rather than performed. <words>376</words> "Some treasures shouldn't be sold." <words>381</words>

As he left the garden, Grimwald whistled a different tune—not to banish doubt, but to celebrate its defeat. <words>399</words> The witch's elegant mayhem had given him something worth more than gold: the courage to treasure truth. <words>416</words>
