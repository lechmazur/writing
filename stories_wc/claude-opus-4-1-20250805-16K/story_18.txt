In the steam-powered city square, where bronze gears clicked beneath cobblestones and vapor hissed from ornate lampposts, Minerva stood frozen as she had for decades—a living statue whose telepathic mind wandered freely while her body remained imprisoned in marble. <words>39</words> The politicians planning the square's renovation circled her pedestal daily, their thoughts bleeding into hers like spilled wine, each lie they told the public burning through her consciousness with searing clarity. <words>69</words> She clutched a threadbare hair tie in her stone fingers, the only remnant of her daughter who'd tied it there before Minerva's curse began, promising to return when she found the witch who'd done this. <words>104</words> Throughout the planning meetings that autumn, as bureaucrats debated whether to weatherize her marble form with protective sealant or demolish her entirely, Minerva listened to their corrupted minds spinning tales of urban renewal while secretly plotting to sell the land to factory owners. <words>148</words> Their thoughts tasted of ash and copper coins. <words>156</words> One morning, a young calligrapher arrived to document the square's "historical preservation," her ink flowing across parchment in elegant strokes that somehow matched the rhythm of truth Minerva felt pulsing beneath all the deception. <words>189</words> The woman's mind was different—clear as mountain water—and when she looked up at Minerva's face, the light of recognition sparked between them like struck flint. <words>215</words> "Mother?" the calligrapher whispered, her brush trembling, sending droplets of ink spattering across her careful work. <words>231</words> The hair tie, weathered by thirty winters, suddenly felt warm in Minerva's grip as her daughter's telepathic gift awakened, inherited but dormant until this moment of tragic joy. <words>259</words> Through their connected minds, Minerva showed her daughter everything: the councillors' schemes, the bribes hidden in charity funds, the false promises made to displaced merchants. <words>284</words> Her daughter's eyes filled with tears that seemed to laugh as they fell, understanding that her mother's curse had become the city's greatest blessing—an immobile witness who could finally expose the truth. <words>316</words> With graceful strokes, the calligrapher began transcribing her mother's telepathic testimony directly onto the square's walls, each word flowing like liquid shadow across the stone, permanently weatherizing the truth against the erosion of time and lies. <words>353</words> The steam whistles shrieked noon as crowds gathered, reading the expanding confession that spiral-wrapped around fountains and benches, while politicians fled through the fog, their plan's corruption laid bare by the tragically joyful reunion of a cursed mother and her gifted daughter. <words>397</words> Minerva felt her marble skin crack slightly—not enough to free her, but enough to smile. <words>413</words> The threadbare hair tie finally snapped, carried away on steam-warmed wind, its purpose complete. <words>427</words> Together, through ink and thought, they would weatherize this square with truth, protecting it from the corrosion of deceit that had plagued it for far too long. <words>455</words> In their gloomy cheerfulness, mother and daughter had found something better than breaking curses—they'd found justice flowing like calligraphy across a city's lying heart. <words>480</words>
