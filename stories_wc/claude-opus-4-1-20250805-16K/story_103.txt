The weatherbeaten knight stood before the brass door knocker, its tarnished surface reflecting not the lighthouse prison's stone wall, but another realm entirely. <words>19</words> Within that mirrored reflection, she saw herself thirty years younger, unscathed by battle, standing at this same threshold. <words>36</words> The knocker had appeared on seven different doors throughout her life—a tavern, a cathedral, a peasant's hut, a ship's cabin, a throne room, a grave marker, and now here. <words>66</words> Only now did she appreciate the pattern: each door had presented her with an impossible choice between duty and love. <words>86</words>

She lifted the heavy brass ring, and time folded. <words>95</words> In the reflection, her younger self lifted it too, creating an infinite corridor of moments. <words>111</words> The lighthouse prison rose from jagged reefs that had claimed her daughter's ship twenty years ago—the daughter she'd abandoned to serve her kingdom. <words>135</words> That final cry of regret had echoed across the waves, haunting her ever since. <words>149</words>

"Mother?" <words>150</words> The voice came from within the reflection, impossibly sweet despite everything. <words>161</words> Her daughter stood there, neither alive nor dead, trapped between worlds just as the knight was trapped between choices. <words>180</words>

The brass knocker grew warm in her weathered hand. <words>189</words> She could knock and enter the reflection, joining her daughter in that liminal space, abandoning the world that still needed her sword. <words>211</words> Or she could release it, accepting the burden of survival, the joyful agony of memories. <words>227</words>

"I made seven choices," the knight whispered, her voice cracking like leather left in salt spray. <words>243</words> "Each time, I chose duty." <words>248</words> Her reflection smiled—grudgingly sweet, forgiving what couldn't be forgiven. <words>257</words>

"And each time, you carried me with you," her daughter replied from within the brass. <words>272</words> "Every battle, every victory, every sleepless night." <words>279</words>

The knight understood then that the pattern wasn't punishment but invitation. <words>290</words> The seven doors hadn't been tests of choosing correctly, but opportunities to appreciate both paths taken and untaken. <words>308</words> Love and duty weren't opposites—they were reflections of the same devotion. <words>319</words>

She knocked three times, the sound reverberating through past and present. <words>330</words> The reflection shattered and reformed, showing not escape but integration: her daughter's spirit merging with her own weatherbeaten soul. <words>349</words> The lighthouse prison transformed too, its stones singing with released sorrow. <words>360</words>

The brass door knocker fell away, revealing no door at all, just open sky where stone had been. <words>378</words> The knight laughed—a sound both broken and whole—as she finally understood that impossible choices only existed when she believed she was separate from what she loved. <words>405</words> The final cry was hushed not by silencing but by embracing it, letting it become part of her song. <words>424</words> She walked forward into the morning, complete at last. <words>433</words>
