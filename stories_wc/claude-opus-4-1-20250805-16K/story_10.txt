The cheerless duelist stood in the abandoned spaceport customs office, listening to the eternal hum of forgotten server rooms that somehow still drew power from the station's dying reactor. <words>27</words> Years ago, she'd killed her brother here—not with blade or bullet, but with her fatal flaw: pride that refused to elasticize, to bend when family needed flexibility. <words>55</words> 

Now Vera returned, drawn by the automated message that had found her across three systems: "Inheritance awaiting collection." <words>73</words> The maggoty wooden chest rattled as she dragged it from behind the customs counter, its decay filling her nostrils with memories of grandmother's kitchen. <words>98</words> Inside, wrapped in synthetic preservation film, lay the family's cookbook—not for food, but for the precisely innovative combat stimulants that had made their bloodline legendary duelists. <words>125</words>

Her brother Marcus had wanted to modify the recipes, make them safer after watching too many cousins burn out, their neurons fried by compounds meant to sharpen reflexes beyond human limits. <words>156</words> But Vera had insisted on tradition, on honor, on the purity of their grandmother's formulas. <words>172</words> Their final duel had been over this very book, and Marcus, refusing to take the traditional stimulants, had been too slow. <words>194</words> One microsecond too slow. <words>198</words>

The chest rattled again—not from movement, but from the molecular destabilizer she'd hidden inside it twenty years ago, still counting down. <words>219</words> She'd programmed it to destroy the book if she ever tried to retrieve it unchanged, a punishment for her inflexibility. <words>240</words> But now, reading Marcus's notes in the margins—his unexpected mutations of family recipes penciled in fading graphite—she understood. <words>258</words> He hadn't been betraying tradition; he'd been trying to save it from itself, to help it evolve. <words>276</words>

The server rooms hummed their mechanical mantra as Vera began combining both versions, her fingers working with the same precision she'd once reserved for her blade. <words>304</words> She created something new: stimulants that enhanced not just reflexes but empathy, that opened neural pathways to connection rather than isolation. <words>326</words> Each molecule she redesigned was an act of forgiveness—for Marcus, for herself, for the grandmother who'd passed down both gift and curse. <words>350</words>

The destabilizer's countdown reached zero, but instead of destroying the book, it activated Marcus's final modification: a holographic message that flickered to life above the chest. <words>378</words> "Sister," his voice echoed through the empty customs office, "I forgive you. Now forgive yourself. Make our legacy better." <words>398</words>

Vera smiled—the first genuine expression to cross her face in decades—as she understood that the greatest duel she'd ever fight was the one against her own unforgiving heart. <words>427</words> The server rooms hummed agreement, their electronic pulse matching her heartbeat as she began her work of transformation. <words>445</words> In this bittersweet reckoning, the cheerless duelist finally found her purpose: not in victory, but in the alchemy of redemption. <words>466</words>
