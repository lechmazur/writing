The seer sat cross-legged in the abandoned control tower, surrounded by empty champagne bottles and deflated balloons from the surprise party that had ended an hour ago. <words>20</words> Everyone else had stumbled home, leaving behind the scent of celebration mixed with dust and rust. <words>36</words> She wasn't supposed to be memorable—that was the point of being nondescript—but tonight, she'd allowed herself to blend into the crowd of archaeologists celebrating their department's funding renewal. <words>65</words>

The encrypted USB drive weighed heavy in her pocket. <words>74</words> Twenty-three years it had taken to reach this moment, twenty-three years since the original crime had been buried beneath bureaucratic concrete. <words>96</words> The drive contained evidence that would finally untangle the web of lies surrounding the Thessalonian Codex's disappearance—not just any relic, but the mythic relic that supposedly revealed the location of humanity's first observatory. <words>129</words>

She pulled out her laptop, its screen casting blue shadows across her unremarkable features. <words>143</words> The encryption was analytically innovative, layered with biological markers that most hackers wouldn't even recognize as locks. <words>160</words> But she'd learned patience in her years of watching, learned that justice didn't always arrive on schedule. <words>177</words>

The first drops of rain began pattering against the tower's broken windows. <words>189</words> After six months of drought, the petrichor rose through the cracks in the concrete, that distinct scent of dry earth greeting water. <words>211</words> She inhaled deeply, and something clicked—the final sequence she'd been missing. <words>222</words> The encryption's creator had been a romantic, had coded the last key to activate only when atmospheric pressure and humidity matched the conditions of a breaking drought. <words>249</words>

"Of course," she muttered with innocent cynicism, the kind that comes from seeing too much while still hoping for better. <words>269</words> "Hide evidence of academic theft behind poetry." <words>276</words>

The files cascaded open: photographs, transaction records, correspondence between the museum director and black market dealers. <words>292</words> The Codex hadn't been destroyed in the fire as claimed—it had been sold to fund someone's retirement villa in Santorini. <words>313</words>

She uploaded everything to seventeen different news outlets, each file tagged with metadata that would trigger release at dawn. <words>332</words> The tower fell silent again except for the strengthening rain, washing away the last traces of tonight's celebration. <words>350</words> By morning, the archaeological world would shake with scandal, and the Codex might finally surface from whatever private collection harbored it. <words>372</words>

Standing to leave, she smiled at the abandoned equipment around her—old radar screens and communication devices that once guided planes safely home. <words>395</words> Now this tower would guide something else home: the truth, arriving twenty-three years late but inevitable as rain after drought. <words>415</words> She disappeared down the rusted stairs, as forgettable as mist, leaving only justice in her wake. <words>431</words>
