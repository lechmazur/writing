Captain Vera Chen rolled her telekinetic dice across the star-chart table, watching them hover and spin as her crew whispered secrets in the corners of the navigation room. <words>20</words> The dice settled on double sixes—her ancestors would have called it heaven's gate, though that language had been dead for centuries. <words>39</words>

"Captain, the terraforming consortium's ships are gaining," her navigator hissed, but Vera's attention fixed on the fragment of medieval tapestry mounted above the viewscreen. <words>63</words> The dragons woven into its threads seemed alive in the flickering light of distant supernovas, their forms echoing the extinct Draconish script her grandmother had taught her—a farmer's language, practical and philosophically grounded in cycles of growth. <words>101</words>

She'd stolen that tapestry fragment from a museum ship, along with encrypted data cores containing pre-collapse agricultural knowledge. <words>119</words> The consortium wanted to patent those ancient farming methods, lock them behind corporate walls, but Vera knew better. <words>137</words> Knowledge of crop rotation, companion planting, and soil preservation belonged to everyone—especially the frontier colonies struggling to feed themselves. <words>157</words>

"Prepare to jump," she commanded, her dice floating upward as she channeled her focus. <words>171</words> The navigation room erupted in sacred disorder as her crew scrambled to their stations, their whispered secrets transforming into urgent preparations. <words>193</words>

Her first mate, Zhou, touched the small bonsai tree magnetized to his console—a family tradition adapted for space, where each crew member planted a tree in the hydroponics bay upon joining. <words>224</words> "The consortium's jamming our translators," he said. <words>231</words> "They're broadcasting in dead tongues—Sumerian, Linear A, something else." <words>240</words>

Vera smiled grimly. <words>243</words> They didn't know she'd spent years learning lost languages from her grandmother's hidden archives, preparing for exactly this moment. <words>262</words> The consortium's coded threats were clear: surrender the agricultural data or burn. <words>274</words>

She spun her dice again, this time igniting them with her mind until they glowed like miniature suns. <words>292</words> "Let them come," she said, understanding flooding through her. <words>301</words> The dragons on the tapestry weren't just decoration—they were memory, encoded in thread and dye, preserving farming wisdom in their very weave. <words>323</words>

"Broadcasting now," she announced, switching to reconstructed Proto-Indo-European, then Draconish, then a dozen other dead languages, seeding the cosmos with agricultural knowledge the consortium couldn't suppress. <words>349</words> Her crew's whispered secrets became a chorus of translation, each member contributing their ancestral tongue. <words>364</words>

The navigation room filled with the harmony of babel as her dice burst into harmless flame, their light reflecting off the tapestry's golden threads. <words>388</words> Through the viewscreen, a hundred colony ships emerged from hiding, receiving her broadcast, ready to plant their own seeds of revolution. <words>409</words>

Vera touched her grandmother's tapestry fragment, feeling the rough texture of preserved wisdom. <words>423</words> Sometimes the highest stakes weren't credits or cargo, but the future itself—and she'd just won that gamble. <words>441</words>
