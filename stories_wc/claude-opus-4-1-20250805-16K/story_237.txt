Marina Voss, psychic genealogist, sat cross-legged in the space pirate ship's brig, rolling a pair of dice between her calloused fingers—one chipped from a century of tumbling through other people's destinies. <words>29</words> The pirates had captured her three days ago, but she wore her chains with proudly humble grace, knowing they'd soon need what only she could give. <words>54</words> Through the porthole, she watched the last star fade into morning light, that ethereal moment when the universe exhaled its dreams. <words>75</words> 

"The puzzle of destiny," she murmured, pressing the chipped die to her temple, "always reveals itself in fragments." <words>93</words> Visions flooded through—abandoned bullet trains on Earth, their seats littered with diaries from the Great Exodus, each one a breadcrumb in time's labyrinth. <words>117</words> She had collected those journals for decades, learning to lengthen each psychometric reading until past and future braided together like DNA strands. <words>139</words> The dice had belonged to the pirate captain's grandmother, a woman who'd gambled everything on a colony ship that never arrived. <words>161</words>

Marina's gift was peculiar: she could trace bloodlines through objects, reading genetic memories like sheet music. <words>177</words> The captain stood outside her cell now, his weathered face betraying nothing, but she heard the alarm bells of heartbreak ringing in his chest—a sound only the grieving know. <words>207</words> "Your sister," Marina said, her voice carrying grave playfulness, "left you these dice before boarding the Konstantin." <words>224</words> His jaw tightened. <words>227</words> "She survived the wreck." <words>231</words>

"Impossible," he growled, but hope cracked his voice like lightning splitting stone. <words>243</words>

Marina spread the diary pages she'd memorized from those ghost trains, each entry a constellation mapping human migration across the void. <words>264</words> "She wrote about you in station logs, using your childhood nickname—'Meteor Boy'—encoding coordinates in love letters she knew you'd never receive." <words>285</words> The chipped die pulsed warm against her palm, a beacon across time. <words>298</words> "She became a transit authority clerk on Ganymede Station, hiding in plain sight, waiting." <words>313</words>

The captain's fingers trembled on the lock mechanism. <words>321</words> "Waiting for what?" <words>324</words>

"For her brother to stop running from ghosts and start chasing stars," Marina replied, tossing him the dice. <words>342</words> "The chip happened when she threw them against your father's grave marker—her way of breaking fate's monopoly on your family's sorrow." <words>364</words>

He caught them, these ordinary miracles that had traveled through space and years to deliver their message. <words>381</words> The brig door swung open, not to free Marina but to invite her deeper into their story—because even pirates need genealogists when the past refuses to stay buried and the future demands witnesses. <words>414</words>

Marina stood, straightening her prison coveralls with dignified humor. <words>423</words> "Shall we go find your sister, Captain?" <words>431</words> Outside, morning painted the cosmos gold, and somewhere among those infinite points of light, a reunion decades in the making waited to unfold. <words>455</words>
