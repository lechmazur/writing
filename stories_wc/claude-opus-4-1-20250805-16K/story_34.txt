The morose sentinel sat in the interdimensional airport lounge, watching travelers fade between worlds like smoke through fingers. <words>17</words> His amber pendant pulsed against his chest, a weight heavier than its size suggested, carrying memories of a home that no longer existed in any dimension he could reach. <words>47</words> The lounge existed across the tapestry of hidden hours—those moments between heartbeats where time forgot to count itself—and here he waited, as he had for centuries uncounted. <words>75</words>

Through the translucent walls, he could see the forge-stations where reality technicians worked, their movements precise as they shaped passages between worlds. <words>98</words> Each gateway required specific patterns, hammered into existence like metal on an anvil, and the sentinel knew them all by heart. <words>120</words> He had learned, through tides of compromise with himself, that being objectively emotional meant feeling everything while acting on nothing—a guardian's curse. <words>143</words>

A child approached, lost between dimensions, her eyes reflecting the same amber glow as his pendant. <words>159</words> "Are you waiting for someone?" she asked with mysterious familiarity, as if they'd met in dreams neither quite remembered. <words>178</words>

"I'm waiting to resurrect the meaning of home," he replied, his voice carrying the echo of hammered metal. <words>196</words> The child tilted her head, studying the pendant that began to unfurl its light like a flower blooming in reverse time. <words>217</words>

"My grandmother had one like that," she whispered. <words>225</words> "She said it could only open doors by matching the hammered shapes on a blacksmith's anvil—the same patterns that built our first home." <words>249</words>

The sentinel's perpetual mourning cracked. <words>254</words> He stood, remembering suddenly why he'd chosen this particular lounge, this specific intersection of possibilities. <words>269</words> The child's presence wasn't coincidence; she was the echo of his bloodline, scattered across dimensions when their world collapsed. <words>288</words>

Together, they walked to the forge-stations. <words>294</words> The sentinel pressed his pendant against the cosmic anvil, and the child placed her small hand over his. <words>312</words> The amber light unfurled completely now, revealing the pattern within—not a map to a place, but a blueprint for belonging. <words>332</words> Each strike against the anvil matched the rhythm of their shared heartbeat, hammering out a doorway not to their old home, but to the understanding that home was never a place. <words>364</words>

It was this—two souls recognizing each other across impossible distances, choosing connection despite the vast indifference of the multiverse. <words>383</words> The portal shimmered open, leading nowhere and everywhere at once. <words>393</words> The sentinel's mourning lifted as they stepped through together, finally understanding that resurrection meant not returning to what was, but creating what could be. <words>417</words> In the interdimensional lounge, their empty seats slowly faded, leaving only the faint scent of amber and the echo of a hammer's song. <words>441</words>
