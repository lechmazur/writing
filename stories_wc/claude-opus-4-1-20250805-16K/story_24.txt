The meandering bard Thessaly wound through the Bibliotheca Montis, a labyrinthine bookstore occupying an entire mountain, her puppet case bumping against towering shelves. <words>19</words> She was ordinarily extraordinary—the kind of person you'd forget meeting until years later, when her words would suddenly bloom in your chest like delayed fireworks. <words>43</words>

In her coat pocket rattled the dentures rumored to belong to a famous figure—Voltaire himself, though the pawnbroker had winked when he'd said it. <words>68</words> They were her talisman now, clicking their porcelain promise as she navigated the bookstore's endless corridors, seeking the hidden bar she'd heard whispered about in lesser establishments. <words>95</words>

The Spine & Spirits occupied a forgotten cavity between Medieval Philosophy and Antarctic Exploration, its entrance disguised as a reading nook. <words>116</words> Inside, broken scholars nursed their wounds with whiskey, their hearts grown cold from too many rejected manuscripts and love letters never sent. <words>139</words>

This was the lull before an apologetic text is sent—that pregnant pause when pride and loneliness wrestle in the blue light of phone screens. <words>164</words> Thessaly recognized it in their hunched shoulders, the way they cradled their drinks like the last warm thing in the universe. <words>186</words>

She set up her puppet theater on the bar's small stage, usually reserved for worse things. <words>203</words> Her marionettes were crude but honest: a paper king with bottle-cap crown, a cloth maiden whose dress was sewn from rejection letters. <words>226</words>

"Once," she began, manipulating the strings while Voltaire's teeth grinned from her pocket, "there was a mountain made entirely of words nobody read." <words>249</words>

Her subversive puppet shows in seedy bars had earned her both disciples and enemies, but here, in this fractured idyll where paradise had been dog-eared and wine-stained, she found her purpose. <words>281</words> The puppets danced through tales of ordinary magic—a librarian who discovered she could taste colors, a student who grew gardens in his footnotes. <words>305</words>

She would sow these stories like seeds in frozen ground, radiating warmth through her ramshackle theater. <words>322</words> The dentures clicked approvingly as her audience leaned forward, their phones forgotten, their carefully maintained cynicism cracking like ice in spring. <words>343</words>

One woman laughed—actually laughed—at the puppet king's fumbling courtship. <words>353</words> A professor wiped his eyes when the cloth maiden found her voice sewn into an encyclopedia. <words>370</words> The bartender, who hadn't smiled since his daughter stopped returning calls, poured free drinks for everyone. <words>387</words>

To stir hearts grown cold was Thessaly's only ambition, her wandering through the mountain's paper wilderness suddenly purposeful. <words>405</words> Tomorrow, her audience would send those texts, make those calls, write those letters. <words>419</words> Tonight, in this impossible bookstore bar, her puppets had made them remember what it felt like to be warm. <words>439</words>

The dentures smiled their ancient smile, and Thessaly packed up her theater, already seeking the next pocket of cold to thaw. <words>461</words>
