The underground poet Marcus had perfected the art of caring without seeming to care, volunteering at the witch's familiar menagerie with the same detached intensity he brought to his verses. <words>24</words> Through volunteer stints in odd places like this one, he'd learned that destiny preferred to be caught off-guard. <words>42</words> While the ravens croaked their prophecies and the serpents coiled in their heated terrariums, he sat crocheting blankets for the smaller creatures, his fingers working yarn with mechanical precision. <words>71</words> 

The menagerie existed in a statically unique state—never changing yet never quite the same, suspended between the mundane and magical like his own carefully cultivated indifference. <words>97</words> Each stitch he made was deliberate, methodical, as if passion itself could be woven into something useful without acknowledgment of its heat. <words>119</words>

Beneath a stack of molting feathers, he discovered an antique map with a tear running through its center, splitting what appeared to be a constellation chart in two. <words>148</words> The witch's familiar, a three-eyed cat named Temporal, watched him examine it with the same disinterested passion that infected everything here. <words>170</words> Marcus recognized the tear wasn't damage but design—a deliberate void where something had been purposefully removed. <words>187</words>

"The brimming cup," he murmured, reading faded text along the map's edge. <words>199</words> It was a phrase from his own unpublished work, written years before he'd learned to volunteer his way through life's margins. <words>221</words> The map showed a location, or perhaps a moment, where overflow became intention. <words>235</words>

He continued crocheting, looping yarn around his hook while the map lay beside him, its tear gaping like an invitation. <words>256</words> The blanket grew beneath his hands, row by row, a soft armor for creatures who'd never asked for protection. <words>276</words> This was how he lived—creating comfort at arm's length, writing poems in subway tunnels where no one would read them. <words>297</words>

But the map suggested something different. <words>303</words> It promised a place where his carefully maintained distance might collapse, where the cup of his restraint might finally spill over. <words>324</words> To seize this possibility meant abandoning his practiced apathy, surprising fate with an unplanned encore when he'd already taken his bow and left the stage. <words>350</words>

Temporal purred, a sound like grinding gears wrapped in velvet. <words>360</words> Marcus folded the map along its existing creases, tucked it into his pocket with the same casual precision he applied to everything. <words>383</words> Tomorrow he would finish the blanket. <words>389</words> Tonight, he would follow the map's promise to where his brimming cup might finally, magnificently, overflow. <words>405</words> The menagerie settled into evening stillness, and Marcus walked out, his disinterested passion finally finding its perfect, impossible target. <words>425</words>
