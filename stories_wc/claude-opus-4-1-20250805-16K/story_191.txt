Marcus had been sober for three years when he arrived at the mist-shrouded island, his cardsharp fingers steady for the first time since abandoning Vegas. <words>20</words> The locals watched him with grudging admiration as he unpacked his most precious possession: an antique ink well that had belonged to a Venetian dream-reader. <words>44</words> 

He'd come to dare the unimaginable—to hasten the awakening of those trapped between sleep and death by analyzing their cameo appearances in strangers' dreams. <words>69</words> The island was boisterously quiet, its silence so aggressive it seemed to shout, pressing against eardrums like deep water. <words>88</words> Marcus set up his practice in an abandoned lighthouse where coffee perpetually cooled in forgotten mugs, each one marking the precise moment another visitor had fled. <words>114</words>

His method was unorthodox: he'd shuffle his worn deck while clients slept nearby, reading not their dreams but the dreams of others where they appeared as background figures. <words>143</words> In these fleeting glimpses—a woman passing through someone's nightmare of missing a train, a man standing silent in another's dream of a crowded party—lay the truth of their unconscious desires. <words>173</words>

Tonight's client was different. <words>177</words> Elena's hushed pleas had reached him through three layers of dreams, each voice growing fainter as it passed from sleeper to sleeper across the island. <words>202</words> "Find me," she whispered through a fisherman's dream of empty nets, through a child's vision of hide-and-seek, through an old woman's memory of lost daughters. <words>228</words>

Marcus dipped his pen in the antique ink well, its obsidian liquid rippling with captured moonlight. <words>244</words> As he began transcribing the dream-fragments onto cards, the ink revealed what ordinary sight couldn't: Elena wasn't trapped in sleep but in the moment between heartbeats, suspended at the instant her morning coffee had cooled in its mug three mornings ago. <words>287</words>

The island's mist thickened as Marcus worked, his sober mind sharp enough to catch the pattern others missed. <words>305</words> Elena appeared in seventeen different dreams that night, always at the periphery, always reaching for something just beyond frame. <words>325</words> In a baker's dream, she stood behind rising dough; in a sailor's, she was a shadow on the water. <words>345</words>

By dawn, Marcus had mapped her appearances into a constellation that pointed to the island's heart—a grove where time stuttered and repeated. <words>368</words> He hastened there, cards in hand, finding her suspended between one breath and the next, her coffee mug still steaming impossibly in the cold air. <words>393</words>

With fingers that once cheated fate at poker tables, Marcus shuffled reality itself, dealing her back into the waking world. <words>413</words> The island exhaled its boisterously quiet breath, and Elena gasped her first new air in seventy-two hours. <words>430</words>

She looked at him with the same grudging admiration the islanders wore—this sober cardsharp who dared read dreams backwards to hasten the impossible into being. <words>455</words>
