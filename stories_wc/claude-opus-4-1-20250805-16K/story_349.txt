Marcus pressed the dried herb bundle against his nose, inhaling the last familiar scent from Earth—sage his grandmother had tucked into his flight suit pocket. <words>19</words> The abandoned observatory perched on the cliff's edge had become his refuge since the portal accident three months ago, when his surveillance drone had somehow torn through reality itself during a routine mission over Afghanistan. <words>52</words>

Below, the medieval valley spread like a tapestry of doomed beauty. <words>63</words> Tomorrow, the baron's men would cut down the sacred orchard, claiming the trees harbored plague spirits. <words>79</words> Marcus knew better—his drone's sensors, miraculously still functional, detected only a fungal blight, treatable with simple copper sulfate. <words>97</words>

The stone chamber echoed with voices as villagers filed in for tonight's "Fate-Matching"—their world's desperate version of speed dating, arranged whenever catastrophe loomed. <words>119</words> They believed pairing souls before tragedy might summon divine intervention. <words>129</words> Marcus had reluctantly agreed to participate, cynically hopeful that mingling might finally help him disseminate his knowledge without being burned as a witch. <words>152</words>

"Three heartbeats with each partner," announced the elderwoman, her scarred hands gentle despite her harsh life. <words>168</words> "Speak your truth quickly." <words>172</words>

The first woman who sat across from Marcus smelled of apple blossoms and impending loss—her family tended the condemned orchard. <words>192</words> "You're the sky-watcher," she said, not a question. <words>200</words> "The one who speaks to invisible spirits through that metal bird." <words>211</words>

"I speak to no spirits," Marcus replied carefully, noting how the candlelight caught her determined eyes. <words>227</words> "But I can save your trees." <words>233</words>

She leaned forward. <words>236</words> "The baron's advisor whispers poison in his ear, says the trees must burn to prevent rebellion, not plague." <words>254</words> "Politics," she added bitterly. <words>257</words> "Dressed as mercy." <words>260</words>

The elderwoman rang her bell—time to rotate. <words>267</words> But Marcus grabbed the woman's wrist, pressing the herb bundle into her palm. <words>280</words> "Burn this tonight in the orchard's heart," he whispered urgently. <words>290</words> "When the smoke rises, I'll send my drone. <words>298</words> Its lights will seem like heaven's sign. <words>305</words> Tell everyone the angels blessed the trees with protective fire." <words>315</words>

She studied him with sudden understanding. <words>321</words> "You're creating a miracle." <words>325</words>

"I'm creating possibility," Marcus corrected, his voice carrying the charred serenity of someone who'd watched too many villages burn from thirty thousand feet, now finally able to intervene. <words>353</words> "Your people already believe in horizons of mercy—places where divine grace touches earth." <words>366</words> "Let me give them coordinates." <words>371</words>

As she stood to leave, she touched his foreign face with unexpected tenderness. <words>384</words> "Perhaps you fell through our sky for this moment, sky-watcher." <words>394</words>

Watching her descend toward the orchard, Marcus felt the weight of his grandmother's gift—not just herbs, but the wisdom to plant hope in scorched earth. <words>419</words> Tomorrow, his drone would dance with sacred smoke, and cynical hope would save what pure faith could not. <words>437</words> In this strange medieval realm, he'd finally found his mission's true horizon—not surveillance from above, but mercy from within. <words>456</words>
