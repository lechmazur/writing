Ezra had spent seventeen years as the begrudging guardian of the Clockwork Aviary, where mechanical birds sang songs that nobody remembered anymore. <words>22</words> His only companion was a rustic bread paddle, worn smooth by his grandmother's hands, which he used to scatter synthetic seeds across copper feeding platforms. <words>46</words> Society had assigned him this role after the algorithms detected his dangerously friendly nature—too willing to trust, too eager to believe in impossible things. <words>71</words> They said it made him perfect for isolation, perfect for a job where his openness couldn't contaminate the carefully regulated world beyond the sanctuary walls. <words>97</words>

But yesterday, everything changed. <words>101</words> A mechanical cardinal had arrived carrying dreamlike postcards from an unknown island, each one shimmering with colors that shouldn't exist within the folds of spacetime. <words>126</words> As Ezra analyzed them, trying to illustrate their meaning in his maintenance logs, he discovered they weren't postcards at all—they were memories. <words>149</words> His memories. <words>151</words> Fragments of a life before the sanctuary, before society had convinced him that joy was dangerous, that his grandmother's laughter while baking bread was a symptom of disorder. <words>180</words>

The postcards showed him teaching children to paint with crushed berries, dancing in thunderstorms, sharing stories that made strangers into family. <words>201</words> Each image pulsed with the lost joy he'd been searching for in the mechanical birds' predetermined melodies. <words>219</words> He realized the sanctuary wasn't protecting society from him—it was protecting him from remembering who he truly was. <words>238</words>

With trembling hands, he held the bread paddle like a torch and began dismantling the aviary's central control panel. <words>258</words> The mechanical birds erupted into chaotic, beautiful song—not their programmed tunes, but something raw and real that seemed to tear through time itself. <words>282</words> As sparks flew and gears ground to a halt, Ezra felt the weight of seventeen years lifting. <words>300</words> He was breaking free from society's grip, one wire at a time. <words>313</words>

When the authorities arrived, they found him sitting among the silent mechanical birds, tears streaming down his smiling face. <words>333</words> He was illustrating a new postcard on the sanctuary wall with oil and rust, depicting himself walking through a door that hadn't existed until that moment. <words>360</words> The joyful sorrow in his eyes told them everything: he had rediscovered what they had tried to make him forget. <words>381</words> He handed them the bread paddle, kissed each mechanical bird goodbye, and stepped through the impossible door into a world where being dangerously friendly was not a flaw but a revolution. <words>413</words> The sanctuary stood empty, filled only with the echo of genuine laughter—the first it had heard in seventeen years. <words>433</words>
