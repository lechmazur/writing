Sister Margot pressed the tarnished silver fork against her palm, its weight heavier than faith itself. <words>14</words> She stood at the edge of the glass desert, where crystallized sand stretched endlessly beneath a copper sky. <words>31</words> The last monarch butterfly of the season trembled on her shoulder, its orange wings catching light like stained cathedral windows. <words>51</words>

She had come here unconvinced, her missionary work feeling hollow after years of preaching miracles she'd never witnessed. <words>69</words> The indigenous peoples spoke of this place where reality bent, where those pure of purpose could channel ancient magic through the resonance of forgotten things. <words>94</words> The fork had belonged to her grandmother, a woman who claimed she could hear God in the spaces between musical notes. <words>115</words>

The abandoned piano sat half-buried in glass shards, its ivory keys bleached by decades of unforgiving sun. <words>132</words> Margot struck a key with the fork, and the untuned string released a sound that shouldn't exist—neither note nor noise, but something between. <words>156</words> The echo bounced across the glass, creating patterns she could almost see, geometric whispers that made her teeth ache with possibility. <words>178</words>

She had to conceal her trembling hands as she decoded what the reverberations revealed: a map written in sound, showing her where faith and magic intersected. <words>204</words> Each discordant echo formed a piece of instruction, capriciously consistent in its logic—never the same pattern twice, yet always leading to the same inevitable conclusion. <words>229</words>

The butterfly lifted from her shoulder, beginning its final migration toward something beyond mere Mexico. <words>244</words> Margot understood then that faith wasn't about conviction but about standing in the space between believing and knowing, becoming a vessel for forces that defied explanation. <words>270</words>

She played the piano systematically, the fork conducting vibrations through her bones. <words>282</words> The glass desert responded, each grain humming in frequencies that human ears weren't meant to process. <words>298</words> Her unconvinced heart cracked open like an egg, and through the fissure, something luminous began to pour. <words>315</words>

The monarch paused mid-flight, hovering impossibly as Margot became what she'd always feared and desired—a conduit for the inexplicable. <words>333</words> Magic wasn't separate from faith; it was faith's raw form before humans dressed it in doctrine and doubt. <words>352</words>

Hours later, alone with an intimacy she'd only felt in empty churches at dawn, Margot watched the butterfly disappear into the horizon. <words>374</words> The fork had turned silver-bright in her hand, polished by purpose. <words>385</words> She remained at the piano, playing untuned hymns to the glass desert, no longer a missionary but something more honest—a translator of the impossible, her tested faith finally finding its true frequency. <words>417</words>
