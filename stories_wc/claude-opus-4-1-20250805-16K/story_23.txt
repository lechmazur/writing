The wandering bard Mellowstring arrived at the solar wind collection point precisely when the orchard's keeper finished the day's final chore—pruning the gravity-apple trees that somehow thrived in the cosmic radiation. <words>27</words> His lute case began to rattle mysteriously, as if the pressed leaves tucked between its strings had suddenly remembered they were once alive. <words>49</words>

"Ah, the Age of Renewal," Mellowstring chuckled to the translucent maintenance ghost who'd been dead for three centuries but still couldn't figure out how to properly haunt anything. <words>77</words> "You're doing it wrong again, Whisp—you're supposed to moan, not giggle." <words>89</words>

The ghost hiccupped ethereally. <words>93</words> "Can't help it—tickles when the solar winds go through me." <words>104</words>

Mellowstring had come here by following wind patterns across seven star systems, his traditionally creative navigation method involving throwing his pressed leaves into the void and singing wherever they pointed. <words>133</words> The leaves, collected from the First Garden before the universe's last reboot, held memories of every cosmic cycle. <words>151</words> Now they rattled harder, sensing their purpose. <words>159</words>

"The universal systems are failing," Mellowstring explained to Whisp, who was now accidentally haunting backwards through time. <words>176</words> "The stellar harmonics have gone flat, black holes are singing off-key, and don't get me started on what's happening to dark matter's rhythm section." <words>201</words>

He opened his lute case, and the pressed leaves swirled out, each one glowing with remembered sunlight from extinct stars. <words>221</words> They arranged themselves into sheet music that only a bard trained in the old ways could read—notes written in photosynthesis and chlorophyll dreams. <words>245</words>

"Is this going to hurt?" Whisp asked, now partially existing in next Tuesday. <words>259</words>

"Only if you have a sense of humor," Mellowstring replied, strumming the first chord. <words>274</words>

The solar wind collection point began to resonate, its massive panels turning like flower petals following an impossible sun. <words>293</words> Each note Mellowstring played sent the pressed leaves dancing through the collector's energy streams, rewriting the fundamental frequencies of reality with traditionally creative algorithms that predated mathematics itself. <words>322</words>

The ghost started laughing—really laughing—for the first time since death. <words>332</words> "It tickles the universe!" <words>336</words>

As Mellowstring played the final movement, following wind patterns both solar and metaphysical, the pressed leaves integrated themselves into the collection point's core. <words>359</words> The Age of Renewal began not with fanfare but with a cosmic chuckle, reality rebooting itself with a better sense of humor this time. <words>383</words>

"Same time next eon?" Whisp asked, finally successfully haunting the present moment. <words>395</words>

Mellowstring packed his empty lute case, smiling. <words>402</words> "Wouldn't miss it for the world." <words>408</words> He wandered off, following new wind patterns toward the next broken symphony in need of traditionally creative repair. <words>426</words>

Behind him, the solar wind collection point hummed contentedly, its restored universal systems now running on equal parts science and whimsy. <words>447</words>
