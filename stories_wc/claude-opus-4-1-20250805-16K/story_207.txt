Mara Chen had always been a forthright peddler, but here in the abandoned space station medical bay, she clutched her dried flower bouquet with hands that trembled between courage and fear. <words>28</words> The universe hummed its secret song through the station's dead corridors, a frequency only the lonely could hear, and she found strange comfort in its cosmic indifference. <words>55</words> Twenty years ago, she'd sworn a blood oath to the Syndicate never to return to this sector, but redemption's path rarely followed convenient routes. <words>79</words> 

She spread the gossip columns across the surgical table, their holographic text flickering like ghosts of old scandals. <words>97</words> Each rumor-laden article from the station's final days held fragments of truth she needed to divide fact from fiction. <words>116</words> "Doctor Evelyn Chen performed unauthorized surgeries," one headline screamed. <words>125</words> Another whispered, "Medical Chief's daughter vanishes amid corruption probe." <words>134</words>

Mara touched the dried roses—her mother's favorite—preserved from the station's botanical garden before the evacuation. <words>149</words> She'd been meekly assertive then, a child trying to defend her mother with quiet determination while investigators tore through these very rooms. <words>172</words> Now she sifted through the digital detritus with merchant's eyes, cataloging lies that had destroyed her family. <words>189</words>

The Syndicate had offered protection in exchange for her silence and eternal absence. <words>202</words> But selling trinkets across the galaxy for two decades had taught her that every oath had its price, and hers had finally been paid in full through accumulated truths. <words>231</words> Column by column, she'd gathered evidence that her mother had been framed, that the real criminals had been the investigators themselves. <words>252</words>

She activated the medical bay's emergency beacon, knowing it would alert both authorities and the Syndicate. <words>268</words> This was how she would divide her past from her future—by choosing truth over safety. <words>284</words> The dried flowers would be her testimony, DNA evidence preserved in their brittle petals, proof of the genetic experiments the investigators had hidden by scapegoating her mother. <words>312</words>

As footsteps echoed in the corridor, Mara smiled with that peculiar joy known only to those who've chosen their loneliness as armor. <words>334</words> She'd traveled every trade route in the sector, sold baubles to thousands, yet kept her true self hidden until now. <words>354</words> The forthright peddler had always been honest about everything except who she really was. <words>368</words> 

The door hissed open, and she stood straighter, meekly assertive as always, holding her mother's flowers like a weapon of truth. <words>390</words> "I'm Mara Chen," she announced to the uniforms flooding in. <words>400</words> "I'm here to break an oath and clear my mother's name." <words>411</words> The universe continued humming its secret song, but now she hummed along, finally free. <words>425</words>
