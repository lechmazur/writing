Mortician Elara Voss had catalogued seventeen thousand deaths, but the tarnished silver bracelet clutched in corpse number seventeen-thousand-and-one contained coordinates to the mangrove labyrinth where spirits sang. <words>28</words> She pocketed it with practiced irreverence, apologizing to no one in particular. <words>40</words> 

The labyrinth appeared only when night yielded to golden embers, that liminal hour when darkness surrendered its grip but dawn hadn't quite claimed victory. <words>65</words> Elara arrived precisely then, following the bracelet's etched directions through twisted roots that formed natural corridors. <words>81</words> The spirits' songs were loudly serene—a paradox of thunderous tranquility that made her eardrums vibrate with peaceful violence. <words>99</words>

"Pardon the intrusion," she called out, maintaining decorum while trespassing on sacred ground. <words>112</words> Her overly curious nature had led her here for one purpose: to collect the dream journals that dying patients whispered about in her preparation room. <words>137</words> They spoke of leather-bound volumes hidden where the singing never stopped, containing the dreams of everyone who'd ever lived. <words>156</words>

A spirit materialized—translucent, shifting, beautiful in its impossibility. <words>164</words> "You must imitate our dance," it said, voice like water over stones. <words>176</words> "But know this: your footprints will vanish after a single heartbeat." <words>187</words>

Elara bowed slightly. <words>190</words> "How delightfully impermanent." <words>193</words> She began mimicking the spirit's movements, each step disappearing instantly behind her, leaving no trace of her passage through this ethereal maze. <words>215</words> The dance was both ritual and map, guiding her deeper through mangrove tunnels where roots dripped with bioluminescent tears. <words>234</words>

Other spirits joined, their songs creating harmonious chaos—a symphony of organized disorder that somehow made perfect sense. <words>251</words> Elara moved with them, her mortician's precision serving her well as she copied each gesture exactly. <words>267</words> The bracelet grew warm against her wrist, pulsing with recognition. <words>277</words>

Then came the rustle of revelation—not a sound but a sensation, like silk scarves brushing against the inside of her skull. <words>298</words> The dream journals materialized, floating between the mangrove roots like suspended memories. <words>310</words> Thousands of them, each containing the unconscious wanderings of souls she'd prepared for their final journey. <words>326</words>

"Take what you came for," the spirits sang in unison, their courtesy laced with mischief. <words>341</words> "But remember—knowledge stolen politely is still theft." <words>348</words>

Elara collected seven journals, one for each day she'd wondered what the dead dreamed. <words>362</words> She tucked them into her satchel with the same care she used when closing a cadaver's eyes. <words>379</words> "Thank you for this discourteous honor," she said, embracing the contradiction. <words>390</words>

As golden embers brightened into proper daylight, the labyrinth began dissolving. <words>400</words> Elara walked backward through her vanishing footprints, returning to a world where death was orderly and spirits didn't sing. <words>419</words> But the journals remained real, their pages rustling with revelations she would spend a lifetime learning to understand. <words>437</words> The bracelet, now bright silver, had served its purpose—leading one overly curious mortician to answers that raised only more beautiful questions. <words>458</words>
