Marcus pedaled harder, his booth of rare stamps fluttering as the bicycle-powered carnival generator hummed to life beneath the old orchard sign, its letters now ghostly shadows on weathered wood. <words>24</words> He'd been an obsessive stamp collector for decades, but tonight he searched for something more—the secrets of magic his grandmother once whispered about. <words>46</words> 

The blank luggage tag hung from his handlebar, waiting. <words>55</words> She'd given it to him thirty years ago, promising that when he found the right name to write on it, he'd understand everything. <words>78</words> 

Between customers, Marcus played bootleg recordings through tinny speakers—lost concerts from the seventies where his grandmother had performed as a stage magician's assistant. <words>101</words> The recordings were his only method to reconnect with her voice, her laugh breaking through applause like a garnet in the dust, precious and unexpected. <words>127</words> Each tape revealed fragments: card tricks explained in jazz rhythms, escape artistry hidden in blues progressions. <words>143</words>

"Your stamps," a child said, pointing at his display with ravenously gentle fingers, careful not to disturb the delicate papers yet hungry to touch their stories. <words>169</words> Marcus recognized that particular yearning—the same way he'd reached for magic as a boy. <words>183</words>

"Choose one," Marcus said, his voice catching. <words>190</words> The admission felt dangerous, this bold vulnerability of offering a piece of his collection. <words>204</words> But watching the child's eyes widen, he remembered his grandmother's final recording, discovered just last week in a shoebox of cassettes. <words>225</words>

"Magic isn't the trick," her voice had said over saxophone swells. <words>236</words> "It's recognizing when someone needs to believe in something impossible." <words>246</words>

The child selected a stamp from 1962—a carousel horse, mid-gallop. <words>256</words> As Marcus lifted it with his tweezers, the carnival lights flickered, powered by a dozen cyclists keeping the dream alive. <words>276</words> He thought of his grandmother, who'd hidden her real magic in music, in moments between performances. <words>292</words>

"Keep pedaling," someone shouted, and the generators surged. <words>300</words> 

Marcus wrote the child's name on the blank luggage tag and attached it to the stamp's protective sleeve. <words>318</words> "For your journey," he said, understanding finally that magic lived in the exchange—in the careful passing of obsessions between generations. <words>339</words> His grandmother hadn't taught him tricks; she'd taught him to recognize fellow seekers. <words>352</words>

The bootleg recording crackled on: "Ladies and gentlemen, the real illusion is that we're separate from wonder." <words>369</words> Marcus smiled, pumping his pedals steadily, keeping his booth bright. <words>379</words> The faded orchard sign creaked overhead, and somewhere in the static between songs, he heard her laugh again—not lost, just waiting to be found. <words>404</words>
