The prophet Kai-7 floated before the observation deck, watching Earth rise over the lunar horizon while absently rolling cracked marbles between synthetic fingers. <words>19</words>

"I suppose you want the truth," she murmured to the colony's gathered miners, her voice carrying that peculiar mix of reluctance and superiority that marked all oracles worth their salt. <words>48</words>

The marbles—each one fractured during the Great Compression Event—held fragments of futures that shouldn't exist together, like mismatched jigsaw pieces she'd discovered last week in that old supply crate from Earth. <words>79</words>

"Between one heartbeat and the next," she began, then paused, savoring their desperate attention while pretending not to, "the cosmic scoreboard will reset." <words>103</words>

The miners leaned forward, their respirators hissing in unison. <words>112</words>

"You see these?" <words>115</words> Kai-7 held up the marbles, their internal cracks catching the earthlight like frozen lightning. <words>129</words> "Each fracture represents a timeline I've had to defragment, piece by painful piece, using nothing but those puzzle edges I found—borders without centers, frames without pictures." <words>156</words>

She'd spent months matching the cardboard edges to the marble cracks, discovering that somehow, impossibly, they aligned. <words>173</words>

"The universe keeps score," she continued, her bashfulness barely masking the thrill of knowing what others couldn't. <words>190</words> "Every choice, every quantum split, tallied and measured." <words>198</words>

But she'd found the loophole. <words>203</words>

"Tonight, when the Earth-shine hits the helium-3 extractors at precisely 23:47, I will speak the final oath." <words>220</words>

The lead miner, Rodriguez, crossed his arms. <words>227</words> "What oath?" <words>229</words>

Kai-7 smiled—that infuriating, humble-yet-knowing smile that made people simultaneously trust and resent prophets. <words>243</words> "The one that scrambles everything." <words>248</words>

She'd been ambivalent about this moment for cycles, torn between preserving the cosmic order and this delicious opportunity for chaos. <words>268</words>

"Imagine," she whispered, though her whisper somehow filled the entire dome, "all of humanity's karma, achievements, debts—shuffled like a deck of cards." <words>291</words>

The marbles clicked in her palm, their cracks spreading microscopically with each collision. <words>304</words>

"You're insane," Rodriguez breathed. <words>308</words>

"Perhaps," Kai-7 agreed cheerfully, though tears traced silver paths down her cheeks—tears of joy, of terror, of relief. <words>327</words> "But in twelve minutes, between your next heartbeat and the one after, I'll speak words that existed before language, using these broken marbles as conduits and those puzzle edges as maps." <words>359</words>

She was happily sad, sadly happy, finally ready to embrace the beautiful destruction of everything counted and measured. <words>377</words>

"The cosmic scoreboard isn't meant to be won," she finished, her arrogance finally, bashfully, blooming into full view. <words>395</words> "It's meant to be scattered to the solar winds." <words>404</words>

The Earth continued its ancient rotation, oblivious to the prophet who would soon unmake its children's destinies with nothing but broken toys and incomplete puzzles. <words>429</words>

In the lunar silence, Kai-7 began to speak the first syllables of humanity's final oath. <words>445</words>
