Maera stood at the atom-powered lighthouse's apex, her fingers tracing constellations on the embroidered tablecloth she'd carried across centuries. <words>18</words> The fabric, woven with threads from her vanished empire, mapped star positions that no longer existed in this timeline's sky. <words>37</words> She was trustworthy strange—a quality the lighthouse keeper recognized immediately when she'd materialized three months ago, speaking dead languages with living breath. <words>59</words>

The lighthouse's reactor hummed beneath her feet, its atomic heart beating steadily while outside, time moved differently. <words>76</words> Here, in the hush of a line that never moves, refugees like her gathered—displaced souls from erased histories, waiting for stellar configurations that might never align again. <words>103</words> But Maera was quietly defiant against this eternal pause. <words>112</words>

Each dawn she borrowed from this new world felt like theft, yet she wore them anyway, draping herself in foreign sunrises while planning her return. <words>137</words> The tablecloth wasn't mere sentiment; its embroidered patterns held navigation charts, each stitch marking temporal coordinates her people had discovered before their empire dissolved into forgetting. <words>162</words>

"The stars align tonight," the keeper whispered, his voice carrying the weight of witnessed impossibilities. <words>177</words> "Your window opens at the third hour." <words>184</words>

Maera nodded, spreading the tablecloth across the lighthouse's observation deck. <words>194</words> The embroidered stars began glowing as their celestial counterparts emerged, each thread responding to its cosmic twin. <words>211</words> She'd waited in this timeless queue long enough, learning patience from the atom-powered beacon that never dimmed, never questioned its purpose. <words>233</words>

Her unstoppable will had crystallized during these months of borrowed dawns—not to return home, for home was ash across forgotten calendars, but to bind old wounds. <words>259</words> Her empire had fallen to temporal wars, its people scattered across centuries like seeds that would never take root. <words>278</words> But she'd discovered something here: the lighthouse served as more than shelter. <words>290</words> It was an anchor point, a fixed star in the chaos of displaced time. <words>304</words>

As the stellar alignment peaked, the tablecloth's patterns began to catapult light upward, creating a bridge between when she was and where she stood. <words>328</words> Other refugees emerged from the lighthouse's shadows, drawn by her quietly defiant act. <words>341</words> They were all trustworthy strange, bonded by their shared displacement. <words>351</words>

"We cannot return," Maera announced, her voice steady as the atomic hum below. <words>364</words> "But we can weave ourselves into this timeline's fabric, one thread at a time." <words>378</words> She lifted the glowing tablecloth, its embroidered stars now reflecting both past and present skies. <words>393</words> "Our empire is forgotten, but we remain." <words>400</words> 

The lighthouse beam swept across them all, borrowed dawn breaking over faces that had outlived their own histories. <words>418</words> Together, they would stitch new constellations into existence, binding old wounds with the unstoppable will of those who refuse to be erased. <words>440</words>
