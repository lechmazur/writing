The abandoned Ferris wheel creaked overhead as Marcus adjusted his binoculars, tracking a barn owl's flight path across the derelict amusement park. <words>17</words> He'd chosen this spot precisely because the prize booth's dusty shelves offered perfect vantage points for observing nocturnal birds—and because he knew she would come. <words>44</words>

Evelyn materialized between the rows of forgotten stuffed animals, her fingers tracing the edges of a vintage pencil box she'd won here forty years ago, before the curse. <words>73</words> "You're three minutes late," she said, wincing as the truth spilled out unbidden. <words>86</words> "I was hoping you wouldn't show up at all." <words>95</words>

Marcus lowered his binoculars with practiced calm, noting how the waxing moon caught the tarnished brass corners of her pencil box. <words>116</words> "How refreshing," he murmured, his tone carrying the politely vindictive edge of someone who'd waited decades for this moment. <words>135</words> "Most people lie about wanting to see me." <words>143</words>

"I can't lie," Evelyn snapped, then softer: "You know I can't lie anymore." <words>156</words> The curse had transformed her from the park's most notorious charlatan into something far more dangerous—someone who revealed uncomfortable truths. <words>177</words>

"The tapestry of fate has interesting threads," Marcus observed, watching a screech owl land on the booth's rotting awning. <words>196</words> "You sold fake fortunes from this very booth, weaving lies into people's hopes." <words>209</words> He pulled out an old photograph: Evelyn, young and smiling, holding that same pencil box while announcing winning lottery numbers she'd invented. <words>231</words>

"I destroyed seventeen marriages, four businesses, and one man's sanity," she admitted, her voice breaking. <words>246</words> "I know exactly what I did." <words>252</words>

Marcus studied the moon's position through a hole in the booth's roof. <words>264</words> "Tonight begins the last phase," he said quietly. <words>272</words> "You have a choice—remain frozen in your cynicism, or evolve." <words>282</words>

"What aren't you telling me?" <words>287</words> Evelyn's question emerged as a desperate truth about her own ignorance. <words>298</words>

"Every lunar cycle, one cursed soul can break free by helping another see clearly," Marcus explained, his fingers drumming patiently on a dusty prize shelf. <words>323</words> "But only if they stop running from what they've become." <words>333</words>

Evelyn clutched the pencil box tighter, remembering the child who'd won it, whose father she'd convinced to invest everything in a fictitious opportunity. <words>356</words> "That was you," she breathed, the truth finally connecting. <words>365</words> "The boy whose father—" <words>369</words>

"Killed himself," Marcus finished with tranquil precision. <words>376</words> "Yes." <words>377</words>

The barn owl hooted as Evelyn felt herself beginning to petrify, not into stone but into something harder—acceptance. <words>395</words> "I'm sorry," she whispered, and for the first time in forty years, she meant it. <words>410</words> The pencil box fell open, releasing a flutter of old fortune cards that transformed into white moths, dancing toward the moon. <words>431</words>

Marcus smiled sadly. <words>434</words> "Truth isn't a curse, Evelyn." <words>439</words> "It's the only prize worth winning." <words>445</words>

Above them, the Ferris wheel groaned once and fell forever still. <words>456</words>
