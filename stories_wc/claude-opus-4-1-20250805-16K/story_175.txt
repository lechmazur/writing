The aged minstrel arrived at the mushroom village carrying only his lute and an empty birdcage, its brass bars gleaming beneath centuries of tarnish. <words>25</words> Every night since the Singing Moon began to wane, he'd positioned himself beneath the vintage sign that marked the village square, studying how its paint chipped away in patterns that revealed older words beneath. <words>58</words> "The truth peels like bark from dying trees," he would explain to passing sprites, his eyes innocently mischievous as he traced the exposed letters with weathered fingers. <words>85</words>

The villagers believed their mushroom homes grew from pure magic, but the minstrel knew better—he could see through their crumbling illusions. <words>107</words> Each flake of paint that fell from the sign exposed fragments of the forbidden knowledge he sought: recipes for consciousness, instructions for cultivating sentient fungi. <words>133</words> The empty birdcage had once held the last oracle-sparrow, whose songs could distinguish truth from carefully maintained lies. <words>152</words> Now it served as his invitation, a symbol recognized by those who remembered when knowledge flowed freely before the Council of Caps declared certain truths too dangerous for common minds. <words>182</words>

Tonight marked the intersection where an old tradition ends—the thousandth year of enforced ignorance. <words>197</words> The minstrel's fingers danced across his lute strings with feral elegance, each note calibrated to resonate with the mycelial network pulsing beneath the village. <words>222</words> "Your houses aren't homes," he sang, his voice carrying the weight of suppressed centuries, "they're fruiting bodies of an ancient intelligence you've been taught to forget." <words>250</words>

The village elder emerged from the largest mushroom, her cap-crown trembling with indignation. <words>264</words> "You speak of things that should remain buried," she hissed, but her authority rang hollow against his melody. <words>283</words> The minstrel lifted the empty birdcage, and moonlight streaming through its bars cast shadows that formed words—the true names of things, the formulas for transformation. <words>310</words>

"I compare the chipped paint each night," he continued, his mischief sharpening into revelation, "because decay is the only honest teacher in a world built on pleasant lies." <words>339</words> The mushroom houses began to pulse, their buried consciousness stirring after generations of slumber. <words>354</words> Spores filled the air like snow, each one carrying fragments of the forbidden knowledge the Council had tried to erase. <words>375</words>

The minstrel smiled as villagers touched the spores and gasped, their eyes widening with terrible understanding. <words>392</words> The empty birdcage would remain empty, for truth needed no caging now that the old tradition of willful blindness had finally ended. <words>415</words> His quest complete, the minstrel walked toward the forest's edge, leaving behind a village wrestling with the feral elegance of awakening. <words>437</words> Behind him, the vintage sign crashed to the ground, revealing at last the words written beneath centuries of paint: "Remember What You Are." <words>462</words>
