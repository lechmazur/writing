Marcus pressed the dried rosebud against the rusted water pipe, listening for the telltale resonance that would reveal the hidden chamber beneath the forgotten castle's library. <words>19</words> Years ago, the Order of Veiled Truths had expelled him for showing mercy to a rival faction's child, but their techniques remained burned into his muscle memory. <words>45</words> The echo test—tapping methodically while pressing organic matter against the pipes—could detect hollow spaces where parallel dimensions bled through. <words>64</words>

He was uncertainly certain this would work; the physics were sound, yet reality itself seemed negotiable in places like this. <words>84</words> The abandoned mansion's library, with its moss-covered shelves and rain-warped books, existed at a crossroads where forgotten worlds pressed against the membrane of the ordinary. <words>110</words>

Three sharp taps. <words>113</words> The rosebud crumbled slightly, releasing a faint perfume that shouldn't have survived its drying. <words>128</words> The pipe sang back a sequence he recognized—not mere echo, but response. <words>140</words>

During this hush of colliding destinies, when the autumn equinox thinned the barriers between realms, Marcus had returned to reconquer not territory, but purpose. <words>164</words> The Order had taught him to exploit these liminal spaces, to harvest their power for dominance. <words>180</words> But he'd learned something they hadn't: hidden worlds weren't meant to be conquered, but understood. <words>195</words>

The floor tiles began separating like water, revealing stairs that descended into soft, pearl-colored light. <words>210</words> Marcus pocketed the rosebud—his grandmother's last gift before the Order recruited him at thirteen. <words>225</words> She'd whispered that it came from a garden that existed in seven dimensions simultaneously, each petal a different color depending on the viewer's capacity for compassion. <words>251</words>

Descending, he found them: the Forgotten. <words>257</words> Neither human nor Other, they were beings caught between worlds during failed crossings, their forms shifting like smoke. <words>275</words> The Order had declared them abominations, void of consciousness, useful only as fuel for their rituals. <words>291</words>

But Marcus saw their eyes track his movement, saw them flinch from sudden sounds. <words>305</words> He pulled out the rosebud, and one creature—vaguely child-shaped—reached toward it with appendages that sparkled like static. <words>323</words>

"I know you understand me," Marcus said, offering the flower. <words>333</words> "The Order was wrong. <words>337</words> You're not empty vessels. <words>341</words> You're lost, and afraid, and magnificent." <words>347</words>

The creature touched the rosebud, and for an instant, it solidified into a young girl with amber eyes. <words>365</words> She smiled, then dispersed again, but something had changed—the entire chamber hummed with a different frequency, warmer somehow. <words>383</words>

Marcus would teach them the echo test, show them how to navigate between worlds safely. <words>398</words> He would kindle empathy where the Order insisted none could exist, proving that understanding trumped dominion. <words>414</words> His exile had become his greatest gift—the freedom to reconquer his own humanity by recognizing it in others. <words>432</words>
