Marcus adjusted his neural interface, the familiar hum of data streams cascading through his consciousness as he navigated the virtual reconstruction of ancient Rome's Forum Boarium. <words>19</words> This wasn't just any hack—it was archaeology through code, a digital excavation of memories the powerful had tried to erase. <words>38</words>

The marketplace materialized around him in stunning detail: vendors hawking garum, slaves carrying amphoras, senators debating beneath painted columns. <words>58</words> But Marcus wasn't here for the spectacle. <words>66</words> He was hunting for traces of Servilia the Forgotten, a name systematically purged from every historical database by the Ministry of Cultural Heritage. <words>90</words>

His avatar knelt beside a merchant's stall, examining what appeared to be worthless debris—a collection of bottle caps from various eras, anachronistically scattered across the ancient stones. <words>118</words> Each cap contained quantum-encrypted data, rarely common artifacts that existed simultaneously in multiple timelines, visible only to those who knew how to look. <words>142</words>

"Three minutes until detection," his timer warned, matching the exact duration needed to steep his jasmine tea in the physical world. <words>164</words> Marcus smiled grimly—he'd programmed the hack to complete within this precise timeframe, a signature move that had become his calling card. <words>186</words>

The Ministry painted him as a monster, a digital terrorist corrupting pristine historical records. <words>201</words> But Marcus knew better. <words>205</words> Every name they erased had been someone's daughter, someone's hope, someone's revolution. <words>218</words> His moral code was simple: no innocent data dies on his watch. <words>231</words>

He touched the seventh bottle cap, triggering a cascade of hidden information. <words>244</words> There—encoded in the merchant's inventory, disguised as a broken rake handle—were tiny inscriptions in Latin, each character a breadcrumb leading to Servilia's true identity. <words>269</words>

The rake handle's virtual wood grain revealed her story: a philosopher who had challenged the Emperor's doctrine of selective memory, arguing that forgetting injustice guaranteed its repetition. <words>297</words> The Ministry had made her a non-person, but her followers had adopted her ideas, spreading them through seemingly mundane objects across the digital reconstruction. <words>322</words>

Marcus felt the familiar rush of confident uncertainty—he'd found her name, but restoring it meant exposing himself to the Ministry's retaliation. <words>343</words> Yet seeing Servilia's words carved into that humble tool, her thoughts preserved by anonymous hands across centuries, made him understand something profound. <words>366</words> The monster they feared wasn't him; it was the truth of their own forgotten humanity. <words>382</words>

His tea timer chimed. <words>386</words> With practiced precision, Marcus uploaded Servilia's complete history to seventeen thousand devices simultaneously, adopting her cause as his own. <words>405</words> The marketplace dissolved as detection algorithms closed in, but her name was already spreading, unstoppable as dawn. <words>423</words> In his apartment, Marcus lifted his perfectly steeped tea, toasting a woman who'd refused to be forgotten. <words>441</words>
