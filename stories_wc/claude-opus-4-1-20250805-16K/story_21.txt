Ambassador Chen traced the fox tail tassel between her fingers, its synthetic fur bristling against her diplomatic composure. <words>16</words> The bandit who'd worn it had murdered her sister seven years ago, and now his genetic patterns flickered across her tablet screen in the abandoned city hall. <words>43</words>

Outside, drum circles thundered through broken windows, their rhythm matching her calculated heartbeat. <words>56</words> The protesters didn't know she was here, decoding what revenge truly cost. <words>68</words>

"You jest," she'd told the underground geneticist who'd sold her the data. <words>80</words> But he hadn't been joking—the bandit's DNA had been altered, organically synthetic modifications that made him nearly untraceable. <words>97</words> Nearly. <words>98</words>

The shuttered children's theater next door leaked its decades-old must through the shared ventilation system, each breath a reminder of innocence lost. <words>119</words> Puppet strings still dangled from the ceiling where she worked, their shadows dancing across her screens like the ghosts of possibilities. <words>140</words>

Chen had spent her career negotiating peace treaties, measuring each word, each gesture. <words>153</words> Now she measured genetic sequences, hunting for the specific markers that would identify him among the city's forgotten populations. <words>172</words> The drums intensified, activists demanding justice for crimes the government ignored. <words>183</words> If only they knew what justice looked like up close—a diplomat gone rogue, her calm abrading against fury like sandpaper on silk. <words>205</words>

The tassel had been her only clue, left deliberately at the scene. <words>217</words> A calling card from someone who thought himself untouchable. <words>226</words> But organic synthesis left traces, microscopic breadcrumbs in the genetic code. <words>237</words> Each drum beat outside marked another sequence analyzed, another step closer. <words>248</words>

She'd resigned her position quietly, citing health concerns. <words>256</words> No one questioned a grieving sister's need for rest. <words>265</words> They didn't see her studying biochemistry texts in this decaying municipal building, learning to read life's source code with the same precision she'd once parsed international law. <words>292</words>

The must grew stronger as evening approached, mixing with smoke from the protesters' fires. <words>306</words> Chen's fingers paused on the tassel as her screen flashed green. <words>317</words> Match found. <words>319</words>

She stared at the address, three blocks from here, where the bandit lived under medical protection—his synthetic organs failing, keeping him barely alive. <words>342</words> The price of his enhancements. <words>347</words> The universe's own revenge, slower than hers would have been. <words>357</words>

Chen stood, pocketing the tassel, her diplomatic training reasserting itself. <words>367</words> She could expose him, let legal justice crawl forward. <words>376</words> Or she could walk away, knowing he was dying in agony, his body rejecting its own artificial evolution. <words>393</words>

The drums stopped suddenly. <words>397</words> In the silence, she heard children laughing somewhere beyond the musty theater, and understood that revenge's true price was becoming someone else entirely. <words>420</words> She left the data for the authorities and walked into the crowd, still measured, still diplomatic, but no longer hunting. <words>440</words>
