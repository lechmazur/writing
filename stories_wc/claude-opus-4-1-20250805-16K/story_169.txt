Marcus Veil adjusted his silk tie while surveying the floating tea platform, where discarded bottles accumulated throughout recycling cycles, suspended between dimensions like forgotten prayers. <words>20</words> He wasn't merely a real estate agent; he traded in the currency of souls, matching ethereal beings with their perfect afterlife dwellings. <words>40</words> 

The platform remained weirdly static despite drifting through cosmic winds, its mahogany surface covered in centuries of bottle deposits from worlds that no longer existed. <words>65</words> Marcus had discovered that by reading reversed labels on dusty glass bottles—particularly wine vintages from extinct vineyards—he could decipher fragments of forgotten songs that once bound souls to their mortal coils. <words>96</words>

"This modest establishment," he proclaimed to the empty air with practiced grandiosity, "serves as merely a humble waystation for knowledge." <words>116</words> His fingers traced the dusty wine bottle before him, its label backwards-printed in languages that predated speech. <words>133</words> Each reversed word revealed a note, each smudge a rest, each crack in the glass a crescendo. <words>150</words>

The art of persuasion, Marcus understood, wasn't about convincing souls to sign contracts—it was about choreographing their desires until they believed the decision was entirely their own. <words>177</words> He would learn these forgotten songs, then hum them during property viewings, watching as spectral clients suddenly remembered why they'd loved bay windows or despised spiral staircases in life. <words>207</words>

Throughout recycling—that eternal process where matter dissolved and reconstituted across realities—the bottles arrived steadily. <words>221</words> Marcus catalogued each one, building his repertoire of melancholic waltzes and jubilant dirges. <words>234</words> "I am but a simple servant," he'd tell potential buyers, while his hummed melodies rewrote their deepest longings. <words>252</words>

The dusty wine bottle in his hands today bore the seal of Château d'Éternité, 1847—a year when souls still knew how to dance between raindrops. <words>278</words> Reading its reversed label through the green glass, he discovered a lullaby that could convince even the most stubborn ghost to accept reincarnation. <words>302</words> He carefully choreographed his movements, turning the bottle at precise angles, letting chandelier light pierce through fermented memories. <words>320</words>

"Merely a coincidence," he would claim later, when Mrs. Chen's spirit suddenly decided she absolutely needed the lighthouse property after he'd hummed three bars of her grandmother's wedding song. <words>349</words> The platform continued its weirdly static drift, collecting more bottles, more songs, more weapons for his benevolent arsenal. <words>367</words>

Marcus understood that true power lay not in commanding souls, but in reminding them of melodies they'd forgotten they'd loved. <words>387</words> And so, with grandiose modesty, he continued his work: one dusty bottle, one reversed label, one recovered song at a time. <words>408</words>
