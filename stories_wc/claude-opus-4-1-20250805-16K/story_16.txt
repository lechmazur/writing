The engine room hummed with dying steam as Marlowe adjusted her amber ring, the last payment from a job she'd rather forget. <words>18</words> She'd freelanced everything—assassin, midwife, clockwork engineer, wedding photographer—but tonight's commission to chronicle Elder Haversham's final wisdom felt different. <words>37</words> The wedding reception above had emptied, leaving only the bride's grandfather muttering equations near the brass pistons. <words>54</words>

"You came," Haversham wheezed, his fingers tracing the rhythm of imaginary waves against the copper panels. <words>70</words> "My last good intention requires someone who understands fragments becoming whole." <words>81</words>

Marlowe recognized the trap immediately—the old man wasn't dying, he was stealing. <words>93</words> The amber ring grew warm, responding to the engine's peculiar new frequency. <words>105</words> She'd been hired not to record wisdom, but to become its vessel, her scattered expertise making her the perfect container for his consciousness. <words>128</words>

"Beautiful plan," she said, matching his wave-rhythm with her breathing, a technique learned from coastal smugglers. <words>144</words> "Using the wedding's emotional residue to mask the consciousness transfer." <words>154</words>

Haversham smiled, pressing ornate levers that shifted the engine's harmony into something almost musical. <words>168</words> "You understand then—why it must be you." <words>176</words>

"I understand you're lonely," Marlowe replied, her words inadvertently profound in their simplicity. <words>189</words> The engine room seemed to pause, steam catching mid-hiss. <words>198</words>

She continued working, pretending to prepare for the transfer while actually reversing the polarity sequence—a trick from her brief stint freelancing as a medium. <words>222</words> "Your wisdom dies with you because you never trusted anyone enough to simply teach them." <words>238</words>

The amber ring pulsed with each wave-rhythm against the metaphorical cliff of Haversham's plan. <words>252</words> She'd outwit him not through violence or flight, but through the very thing he'd lost—genuine connection. <words>269</words>

"The bride upstairs," Marlowe said softly, "your granddaughter—she has your eyes, your mind." <words>282</words> "But you spent her wedding down here, plotting theft instead of dancing." <words>294</words>

The old man's hands trembled on the controls. <words>302</words> The transfer matrix flickered, its scattered harmonies suddenly discordant. <words>311</words>

"Chronicle this," Marlowe said, removing the amber ring and placing it in his palm. <words>325</words> "The last good intention isn't the one you take to your grave, but the one you leave behind for others to complete." <words>347</words>

The engine's rhythm slowed, matching a heartbeat rather than waves. <words>357</words> Haversham looked at the ring, then up through the ceiling where his granddaughter's laughter once echoed. <words>373</words>

"Teach her," he whispered. <words>377</words>

Marlowe nodded, already composing the first lesson in her mind—how wisdom travels not through theft but through trust, scattered across generations like harmony finding its way home. <words>404</words> The engine room settled into quiet purpose, and somewhere above, the last wedding flower fell. <words>419</words>
