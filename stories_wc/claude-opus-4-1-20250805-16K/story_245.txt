Captain Vega slammed her fist against the rusted console, her morning jog through the abandoned spaceport interrupted by the discovery. <words>17</words> The flight deck's viewing screens, dead for decades, reflected her fury back at her—a smuggler betrayed by her own heart. <words>36</words>

She'd been running these empty corridors for months, searching for the hidden waterfalls her partner had spoken of before his death. <words>58</words> Not literal waterfalls—that would be absurd on a derelict station—but data streams, cascading information worth fortunes to the right buyer. <words>78</words> Her heart had revolted against the grief, refusing to accept he was gone, driving her legs forward each dawn through these metal halls. <words>102</words>

The single chopstick lay precisely where he'd left it, balanced on the navigation panel like an accusation. <words>119</words> Jin had always carried one, never a pair, claiming it helped him think asymmetrically. <words>134</words> She picked it up, feeling its weight—abstractly physical, somehow both there and not there, like her memories of him. <words>153</words>

"Damn you," she whispered, though whether to Jin or herself, she couldn't say. <words>166</words>

Her thermos of tea had spilled during her outburst, spreading across the dusty console in familiar patterns. <words>183</words> She'd seen him do this countless times—reading futures in the leaves, memorizing routes through the dregs. <words>199</words> Now the liquid formed a map she recognized: the station's lower levels, with a path marked clearly toward Hangar Seven. <words>219</words>

Her breath caught. <words>222</words> Jin had been trying to memorialize something in those tea ceremonies, she realized. <words>235</words> Not predict the future, but preserve the past—coordinates, maybe, or access codes hidden in the seemingly random scatter of leaves. <words>255</words>

She ran harder now, abandoning her usual route, following the pattern burned into her memory. <words>271</words> The chopstick became her dowsing rod, pointing toward secrets Jin had hidden from everyone, including her. <words>288</words> Her anger transformed into something sharper—not rage at his death, but at his lack of trust. <words>305</words>

Hangar Seven's doors groaned open at her approach, recognizing her biometrics. <words>315</words> Inside, the waterfalls revealed themselves: holographic data streams cascading from ceiling to floor, beautiful and terrible. <words>331</words> Financial records, political blackmail, stolen corporate secrets—enough to destroy worlds or build them. <words>344</words>

She understood now why Jin had hidden this, why he'd made her search. <words>358</words> The heart's revolt wasn't just grief—it was the rebellion against easy answers, against unearned wealth. <words>373</words> He'd made her work for it, run for it, earn it through sweat and fury and loss. <words>391</words>

Vega touched the chopstick to the nearest data stream, watching it part like water. <words>405</words> "You bastard," she said with biting sincerity, smiling through her tears. <words>416</words> "You beautiful, infuriating bastard." <words>420</words>

She began downloading everything, finally understanding that some treasures could only be found by those willing to let their hearts break first. <words>443</words>
