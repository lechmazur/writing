Captain Elara found her ship's caretaker in the cargo hold again, drawing cloud formations on the metal floor with stolen chalk. <words>16</words> "You know those atmospheric patterns don't exist out here," she said, her voice carrying that gentle harshness that kept her crew alive through countless raids. <words>41</words>

Old Tam looked up with his perpetual wry smile, the one that suggested he knew jokes the universe hadn't invented yet. <words>62</words> "Don't they?" he asked, warmly aloof as always, maintaining that perfect distance that made everyone trust him without quite knowing him. <words>83</words>

She watched him trace another cumulus curve across the deck plating. <words>94</words> The chalk scraped like memory against bone. <words>101</words> "The crew's asking questions again," Elara said. <words>108</words> "About why you track clouds that aren't there, about why you sometimes vanish mid-conversation like smoke." <words>124</words>

Tam's hand paused. <words>127</words> "Time isn't what they think it is," he murmured. <words>136</words> "Not out here, between the stars." <words>142</words> He drew another line, connecting patterns only he could see. <words>152</words> "I learned that when the old Earth phones died—you remember that sound?" <words>164</words> His eyes grew distant. <words>168</words> "When the dial tone just... stopped?" <words>174</words> That was the moment, that silence after centuries of connection, when humanity finally understood they'd been measuring duration all wrong." <words>194</words>

Elara crouched beside him, careful not to smudge his work. <words>204</words> "And the clouds?" <words>207</words>

"Every cloud that ever was still moves through spacetime," Tam explained, his chalk never stopping. <words>222</words> "I track their paths because they show me when things will happen, have happened, are happening." <words>238</words> He glanced at her sideways. <words>243</words> "Like your raid tomorrow that already failed." <words>250</words>

Her blood chilled. <words>253</words> "What?" <words>254</words>

"The endless 'what if' siren song," Tam continued, drawing faster now. <words>265</words> "It drowns sailors in possibility, makes them chase shadows of choices never made." <words>278</words> His chalk circled back, creating a storm system that somehow looked familiar. <words>290</words> "But if you track the clouds—the real ones, the ones that exist across all moments—you can hush that song." <words>309</words> He stood, dusting white powder from his knees. <words>317</words> "You can see which path the ship must take." <words>326</words>

"You're saying—" <words>328</words>

"Change course by seven degrees starboard when the chronometer strikes eighteen hundred." <words>339</words> Tam's wry smile deepened. <words>343</words> "Trust the cloud paths, Captain." <words>348</words> He began to fade at the edges, his peculiar vanishing act that defied physics. <words>362</words> "Time remembers everything, even the futures we avoid." <words>370</words>

Elara stared at the chalk patterns on her cargo hold floor—a map of possibilities, drawn in white on black, showing her the shape of time itself through the memory of Earth's ancient skies. <words>403</words>

She changed course at eighteen hundred. <words>409</words> The ambush missed them by seconds. <words>415</words> In the cargo hold, Tam's chalk drawings slowly faded, but their truth lingered like stardust, proving that sometimes the gentlest harsh wisdom comes from those who care enough to watch clouds that no longer exist. <words>449</words>
