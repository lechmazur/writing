The frail guard stood at the water's edge, watching the tide recede from the island where the Sorting would determine everyone's painted allegiances by dawn. <words>25</words> His thin fingers traced the latest message carved into the salt-weathered oak: "The phial works—one drop erases the marks." <words>44</words> Throughout the compound behind him, initiates lined up for their fate-painting ceremony, where colored symbols would be permanently etched onto their skin, binding them to masters they'd never chosen. <words>73</words> 

He was resolutely wavering—committed to his indecision—refusing to accept the crimson mark of servitude that awaited all guards born to his station. <words>96</words> The sour-smelling alchemy phial hidden in his coat had cost him three years' wages and his mother's ring. <words>114</words> Its acrid vapor promised freedom from the predetermined paths that trapped generations of his family in endless watchtower shifts. <words>133</words>

Another carved response appeared while he patrolled: "High tide at midnight—swim east—mainland sympathizers waiting." <words>147</words> His heart quickened, though his body remained too weak from years of poor rations to feel true excitement anymore. <words>167</words> The Sorting masters never suspected their guards would communicate through the ancient trees, believing them too broken to organize. <words>187</words> 

As painted initiates emerged throughout the evening, their fresh allegiance marks glowing blue for scholars, green for merchants, black for warriors, he saw his own future approaching. <words>215</words> The youngest initiates wept at their assignments while others celebrated, but all were forever bound. <words>231</words> He thought of his grandfather's faded crimson mark, how the old man died still guarding the same gate he'd been assigned at fifteen. <words>254</words>

When the Sorting bell called his name, he didn't hesitate. <words>264</words> He yanked the cork from the phial and swallowed its bitter contents before the masters could stop him. <words>282</words> The potion burned through him, erasing not just future marks but past bloodlines, ancestral obligations, everything that chained him here. <words>302</words> The masters shouted as his skin rejected their crimson paint, the mark sliding off like water. <words>319</words>

"Unmarked! Unmarked!" they cried, the worst fate in their eyes—to belong nowhere. <words>331</words> But he smiled through his fear. <words>337</words> The tide was returning, and with it, his chance. <words>346</words> He stumbled toward the eastern shore, his frail legs finding strength in possibility. <words>359</words> Behind him, the Sorting continued, painting destinies on willing and unwilling skin alike. <words>372</words> 

He carved one final message as he waded into the dark water: "Some fates are worth drowning for." <words>390</words> The mainland lights flickered like stars across the channel, promising nothing certain except the choice to try. <words>407</words> The cold tide lifted him, and he swam. <words>415</words>
