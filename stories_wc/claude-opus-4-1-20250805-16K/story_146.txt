Marlena had spent years pretending to read palms in tourist markets, but the real visions that came regularly seldom—perhaps once a season—were what drove her to explore. <words>25</words> Throughout planting season, she'd been having the same vision: ancient symbols dancing above a bone flute, whispered words in languages long dead. <words>47</words> The vision always ended with coordinates that led her here, to Prague, where she'd taken chances getting deliberately lost in the maze of old streets. <words>73</words> 

Her fraudulent crystal ball had paid for the journey, but genuine prophecy had guided her steps through the rain-slicked cobblestones until she discovered it: the Archive of Extinct Languages, hidden behind an unmarked door. <words>107</words> The curator, sensing her desperation, had allowed her inside despite the late hour. <words>121</words> "To study sacred development," she'd lied smoothly, though perhaps it wasn't entirely untrue. <words>135</words>

The peaceful anger that had simmered in her chest for months—fury at her gift's cryptic nature, yet acceptance of its wisdom—intensified as she wandered the dusty shelves. <words>163</words> Row after row of preserved texts in Sumerian, Linear A, Proto-Elamite, languages that had died before Christ walked the earth. <words>184</words> Then she saw it: a glass case containing the exact bone flute from her visions, discovered in a crypt beneath the building's foundation decades ago. <words>210</words>

The plaque read: "Origin unknown. Markings suggest ritualistic use in agricultural ceremonies." <words>223</words> Marlena pressed her palm against the glass, and the vision crashed over her with unprecedented force. <words>240</words> She saw priests chanting in a tongue that predated written history, calling forth the season's first seeds with notes from this very instrument. <words>264</words> They weren't just planting crops—they were planting languages, seeding human consciousness with the ability to name the unnameable. <words>282</words>

The curator found her hours later, transcribing symbols that shouldn't exist in any archive, writing in languages she'd never learned. <words>303</words> "How?" he whispered. <words>306</words> She looked up, her eyes reflecting centuries of forgotten knowledge. <words>317</words> "I'm a fortune teller," she said simply, her voice carrying the controlled rage of someone who'd spent years being dismissed as a fraud while carrying unbearable truth. <words>346</words> "But fortune doesn't always mean future." <words>353</words>

The bone flute began to hum behind its glass, resonating with the spring rain drumming against the windows. <words>372</words> Throughout planting season, she would return here, studying the sacred development of human language itself, learning how words became prayers, how prayers became prophecies. <words>397</words> Her taken chances had led her to understand that some gems remain hidden not because they're lost, but because they're waiting for someone who can truly see. <words>425</words>
