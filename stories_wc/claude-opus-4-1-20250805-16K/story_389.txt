The thin-lipped warlock descended the mine shaft's corroded ladder, his formally casual attire—a moth-eaten smoking jacket over spelunking gear—catching on rusted rungs. <words>20</words> December thirty-first had arrived, and with it, his annual pilgrimage to the forgotten library that slouched in the abandoned copper mine's deepest gallery. <words>42</words>

He knew, with confusing certainty, that tonight's research would optimize his understanding of lost artifacts. <words>57</words> The discredited textbooks lining these damp shelves contained rumored cures for the blindness that afflicted all who gazed directly upon divine relics. <words>79</words> Other scholars had warned him repeatedly: such knowledge was poison fruit, sweet to taste but fatal to digest. <words>97</words> He would gorge on it anyway. <words>103</words>

The library's entrance materialized through sulfurous fog—a Gothic archway incongruously carved into raw stone. <words>118</words> Inside, phosphorescent fungi provided wan illumination across thousands of volumes that academia had deliberately forgotten. <words>134</words> The warlock's fingers, pale as cave fish, traced spine after spine until finding his quarry: "Ocular Transmutations for Viewing the Unseen" by the heretic Mordechai Blyne. <words>161</words>

He opened to Chapter Seven, where Blyne described a Viking ship figurehead fragment—specifically the serpent's eye—that could serve as a lens for safely observing artifacts of terrible power. <words>190</words> The text claimed this fragment lay hidden in the very mine where the library resided, placed here by monks who'd fled the Inquisition. <words>214</words>

The warlock's thin lips curved into what might charitably be called a smile. <words>227</words> He'd spent eleven months optimizing his search pattern through these tunnels, cross-referencing Blyne's cryptic marginalia with geological surveys. <words>246</words> The figurehead fragment wasn't merely another lost artifact—it was the key to viewing all others without consequence. <words>263</words>

Following Blyne's instructions, he mixed mercury with crushed beetles and his own blood, painting symbols on his eyelids. <words>281</words> The cure felt simultaneously right and wrong, like remembering a dream while still dreaming it. <words>297</words> His enhanced vision pierced the library's false wall, revealing a narrow passage. <words>310</words>

There, embedded in quartz, gleamed the serpent's eye—a crystal carved by Viking hands, polished by centuries of dripping water. <words>330</words> He pried it free with trembling fingers, feeling its power surge through him like ice water in his veins. <words>350</words>

Through this ancient lens, the library transformed. <words>357</words> Every book blazed with hidden text, every shadow writhed with forgotten names. <words>370</words> The warlock understood, with that same confusing certainty, that he'd found not protection but amplification. <words>386</words> The warnings had been accurate—he was gorging on poisoned fruit. <words>397</words> But what fruit it was, what terrible sweetness flooded his mind as the calendar's final page turned and his humanity dissolved into pure, omniscient madness. <words>423</words>

He laughed, thin lips splitting, optimized at last. <words>432</words>
