After the last resource war scorched reality itself, Mara lived where the ethereal plains met the ghost-sea, breeding seeds that sang. <words>19</words> Her father's magician's deck of trick cards lay scattered across her workbench, each one inscribed with genetic sequences he'd stolen from the corporate vaults before everything burned. <words>47</words> She'd inherited his typically atypical mind—the kind that saw music in molecular structures, that heard boundaries humming between what was and what could be. <words>72</words>

The bottles arrived each dawn, carried by waves that shouldn't exist on plains that defied physics. <words>88</words> Inside: orders from the Collective, demanding specific crops, specific yields, specific surrender. <words>100</words> They still believed they owned her father's debt, and therefore owned her. <words>112</words>

But Mara had discovered something in the cards' hidden compartments—not just genetic codes, but frequencies. <words>128</words> When she arranged them in certain patterns, they resonated with the seeds, teaching them to sing the song of boundaries. <words>148</words> Not walls, but membranes. <words>152</words> Not limits, but transitions. <words>156</words>

She would jabber to herself while working, a stream of consciousness that kept the loneliness at bay: "Tomatoes that taste like memory, wheat that grows in shadows, corn that feeds on starlight—yes, yes, boundary-singers all." <words>192</words> The plains themselves seemed to listen, their ethereal soil shifting to accommodate each new impossibility she planted. <words>209</words>

Today's bottle contained an ultimatum: return to the Collective's underground farms or they would come for her. <words>226</words> Mara crushed it slowly, mixing the glass into her newest batch of seeds. <words>239</words> Glass held light; light held information; information could become rebellion. <words>249</words>

She dealt the cards like her father once did on stage, but this wasn't illusion—it was transformation. <words>267</words> Each seed she created carried a piece of her father's last trick: the ability to grow anywhere, for anyone, without masters. <words>288</words> The cards whispered their sequences while she worked, a language between science and magic that only the typically atypical could understand. <words>310</words>

By nightfall, she'd filled a hundred bottles with her singing seeds, each one coded to ignore the Collective's agricultural controls. <words>331</words> She carried them to where the ghost-sea lapped at reality's edge. <words>342</words> "Find the others," she whispered, releasing them to the impossible tide. <words>353</words> "Find everyone who wants to grow free." <words>360</words>

The plains hummed approval, their boundaries soft with raw solace. <words>370</words> Tomorrow, the Collective might come, but tonight, her seeds rode the waves toward a thousand different shores, carrying the song of boundaries to every survivor who'd forgotten they could choose what grew in their own soil. <words>406</words> Mara returned to her workshop, shuffling the cards for tomorrow's revolution. <words>417</words> Her father's debt was paid in full—not to those who claimed to own it, but to the future itself. <words>436</words>
