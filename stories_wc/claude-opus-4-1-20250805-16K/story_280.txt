The hermit beekeeper adjusted her brass measuring cups on the quasar observation deck, each one reflecting the light of dying stars. <words>20</words> She had brought her hives here, to Station Aphelion, where the vacuum-sealed apiaries thrived in controlled biodomes beneath the transparent floor. <words>39</words> Through the hush of distant galaxies, she studied the patterns her bees made against the cosmic backdrop, seeking to become a master of strategy by understanding their ancient wisdom. <words>68</words>

"You shouldn't be here alone," said Commander Zhou, his voice sweetly confrontational as honey laced with venom. <words>85</words> 

"The bees disagree," she replied, watching him through the reflection in her largest brass cup. <words>100</words>

Below them, artificial snow had been spread across the biodome floor—a training ground where she taught her bees to communicate via the pattern of animal tracks in the snow, a language she'd invented during her isolation. <words>135</words> Each morning, she would knead balls of pollen and propolis, shaping them into messages her bees would interpret and answer with their choreographed flights. <words>159</words>

Zhou stepped closer, his boots clicking against the observation deck's polished surface. <words>171</words> "The Board wants you to share your methods." <words>179</words>

"Mixed blessings, Commander." <words>182</words> She turned, holding up the smallest brass measuring cup, where a single bee rested. <words>196</words> "This one can pollinate an entire hydroponics bay, but she'll die doing it." <words>209</words> She gestured to the swarm below, tracing infinity symbols in the snow. <words>221</words> "They've learned strategy from isolation, from silence, from the absence of Earth's electromagnetic noise." <words>235</words>

Through the viewport, a quasar pulsed, its jets spanning light-years. <words>245</words> The beekeeper had chosen this station specifically for its view—the universe's most violent phenomena visible in magnificent simplicity, reduced to a gentle flickering that her bees could sense through the deck's vibrations. <words>276</words>

"They dance differently here," she continued, kneading another pollen ball with practiced fingers. <words>289</words> "They've evolved beyond the waggle dance, beyond what Earth's bees remember." <words>300</words> She scattered the pollen below, and the bees immediately formed a perfect spiral, mimicking the galaxy visible through the transparent aluminum beneath their feet. <words>324</words>

Zhou watched, transfixed, as the bees created constellations in their flight patterns, each movement a calculated strategy for survival in the void. <words>346</words> "Teach me," he said finally. <words>351</words>

The hermit beekeeper smiled, measuring out exact portions of synthetic nectar with her brass cups. <words>366</words> "First lesson: loneliness is the greatest teacher." <words>373</words> She handed him the medium cup, its weight surprising him. <words>383</words> "Second: every blessing carries its sting." <words>389</words>

As distant galaxies wheeled in silence overhead, she began showing him how the bees read the universe itself, transforming cosmic radiation into honey sweeter than Earth had ever known. <words>418</words>
