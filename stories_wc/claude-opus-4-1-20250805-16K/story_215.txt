Father Marcus pressed his trembling fingers against the vintage postcard depicting the old Heidelberg Institute, its edges worn from decades of handling. <words>18</words> The psychic research facility's sterile corridors echoed with waltz music from the mandatory Wednesday afternoon dance lessons—Dr. Brennan's peculiar method of "synchronizing psychic wavelengths." <words>39</words>

"Still rattled from yesterday's session?" <words>44</words> Dr. Ava Chen materialized beside him, her tone carrying that distinctive coy aggression she wielded like a scalpel. <words>61</words> Marcus forced himself to maintain composure, though inwardly his social nature screamed to confess everything about the entity that had spoken through the test subject. <words>85</words>

"The postcard," she continued, plucking it from his grip, "is the first puzzle." <words>98</words> Her smile suggested she knew exactly why the Vatican's most decorated exorcist had really come to their facility. <words>116</words> "Seven more await, each guarded by someone here who's experienced... similar revelations." <words>128</words>

Marcus watched her disappear into the dance studio where researchers paired off, their movements deliberately calculated. <words>144</words> He'd spent fifteen years casting out demons, but here, amid the tango lessons and EEG machines, he was expected to synthesize faith with empirical data. <words>169</words> The Church wanted proof; the scientists wanted miracles documented in peer-reviewed journals. <words>181</words>

Dr. Chen's assistant, Timothy, stumbled through a foxtrot while clutching a manila folder—the second puzzle, Marcus realized. <words>198</words> Each dancing researcher held something: a crystalline pendulum, a leather journal, a brass compass, items that seemed mundane yet thrummed with significance. <words>220</words> The facility's true purpose emerged through these guarded disclosures, each revelation carefully choreographed like the dances themselves. <words>237</words>

"Father," Timothy gasped between steps, "the room you're seeking isn't just hidden—it's quantum-locked." <words>251</words> He pressed the folder into Marcus's hands as his partner spun him away. <words>265</words> Inside: electromagnetic readings that perfectly matched the fluctuations Marcus had recorded during exorcisms. <words>278</words>

Science entwining with wonder—exactly what he'd been promised, yet nothing like he'd expected. <words>291</words> The remaining puzzles revealed themselves through the dancers' deliberate stumbles, whispered coordinates during dips, and equations traced on foggy windows. <words>311</words> Each disclosure built upon the last, creating a map not of physical space but of consciousness itself. <words>328</words>

By the waltz's final measure, Marcus stood before a seemingly blank wall, eight solved puzzles resonating in harmonic frequency. <words>348</words> The hidden room materialized like a confession finally spoken aloud—inside, hundreds of postcards from exorcists worldwide, each documenting encounters that defied both scripture and science. <words>373</words>

"Welcome," Dr. Chen said, no longer coy but genuinely warm, "to where we stop pretending there's a difference between the miraculous and the measurable." <words>397</words> Marcus's rattled faith suddenly felt steady, synthesized at last with something larger than doctrine or data alone. <words>414</words> The dance, he understood now, had never been about the steps—it was about learning to move between worlds without losing your balance. <words>437</words> Here, in this liminal space where possessed souls met particle physics, his true work could finally begin. <words>454</words>
