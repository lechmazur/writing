The obsidian skyscraper housed Memorial Hospital's psychiatric ward, where Dr. Elena Marsh worked the quiet shift before sunrise, her pleasant meddling disguised as therapy. <words>23</words> She carried a pair of rusted ice skates everywhere—artifacts from her grandmother's escape across a frozen Baltic Sea, their blades etched with symbols no scholar could decode. <words>49</words>

Tonight, her most puzzling patient had vanished. <words>56</words> Marcus, who claimed the building's black glass walls contained ancient writing visible only to those "properly scattered," had left through a door that shouldn't exist. <words>81</words> Elena followed his wet footprints—impossibly sandy, as if from a beach—down corridors that twisted in ways the hospital's blueprint never showed. <words>103</words>

She was openly manipulative with her patients, planting suggestions like scattered seeds in their minds, watching what grew. <words>121</words> But Marcus had reversed her technique, leaving breadcrumbs of lucid confusion that pulled her deeper into the building's impossible geometry. <words>141</words> The footprints grew fainter with each turn, receding like tide marks, leading her past rooms where other patients sat frozen mid-gesture, their eyes tracking something she couldn't see. <words>170</words>

"You're wondering about the symbols," Marcus's voice echoed from everywhere and nowhere. <words>182</words> "Your grandmother knew—that's why she kept those skates." <words>190</words>

Elena's fingers traced the rust-rough metal. <words>196</words> The corrosion had always seemed random, but now, in the pre-dawn darkness of this place between places, patterns emerged. <words>215</words> Each oxidized whorl matched the shadows cast by the obsidian walls when moonlight struck at precise angles. <words>232</words>

"The building remembers everything," Marcus continued, his words seeming to weaken the walls themselves, making them translucent. <words>248</words> "Every patient, every treatment, every scattered seed of madness or clarity." <words>259</words> Through the thinning black glass, Elena saw herself reflected infinitely—past sessions where she'd carefully unraveled minds, thinking she was healing them. <words>281</words>

The footprints ended at a window overlooking an impossible beach, waves lapping at sand that existed thirty floors above the city. <words>302</words> Marcus stood there, no longer her patient but something else, something that had always lived in the space between architectural plans and built reality. <words>327</words>

"Your grandmother didn't escape across ice," he said gently. <words>336</words> "She escaped through it, just as you're about to." <words>345</words> The skates grew warm in Elena's hands, their rust flaking away to reveal more symbols—not ancient at all, but instructions for navigating spaces that shouldn't exist. <words>372</words>

As the first light of sunrise began to dissolve the obsidian walls, Elena understood with perfect, lucid confusion that she had never been the one planting seeds. <words>399</words> She'd been the garden all along, and Marcus—or whatever wore his shape—had been tending her carefully, preparing her to bloom into something that could read the writing that had always been there, waiting in the walls. <words>436</words>

The hospital would find her office empty that morning, only rust-flakes and sand marking where she'd stood. <words>453</words> The pleasant meddler had finally been meddled with, scattered like seeds on an impossible wind. <words>468</words>
