The pixelated moon cast blocky shadows across Level Seven's abandoned arcade district, where Morthis the necromancer clutched his glowing fishhook with trembling fingers. <words>24</words> His typically bizarre habit of resurrecting dead pixels had always made other sprites nervous, but tonight his jumpiness stemmed from a different source entirely. <words>48</words> Echoing footsteps pursued him through the maze of corrupted save files, each digital click reverberating off the cyan brick walls like hammering code. <words>71</words>

While the old gods slumbered in their ROM chambers, their avatar still ruled this retro world with manufactured benevolence. <words>90</words> Princess Elektra, beloved by every NPC from the mushroom kingdoms to the space corridors, was not what she seemed. <words>109</words> Morthis knew this because the dead pixels whispered their secrets when he raised them, speaking of deleted memories and overwritten truths. <words>131</words>

The fishhook pulsed brighter as he approached the hidden loading screen where rebels had once painted their final message. <words>150</words> The mural flickered between frames, a glitched memorial depicting Elektra consuming smaller sprites, their life bars draining into her perfect polygonal form. <words>173</words> But the authorities claimed it was corrupted data, visual nonsense from a system error. <words>188</words>

Morthis began to falter as the echoing footsteps multiplied, surrounding him in stereophonic menace. <words>202</words> His hands shook as he held the moonlit fishhook to the wall, its glow revealing what ultraviolet debugging never could. <words>223</words> By analyzing the paint drips on the hidden protest mural, he discovered they weren't random at all but encoded testimonies, each streak containing the final inputs of terminated programs. <words>253</words>

The princess had been deleting dissidents and absorbing their processing power, growing stronger while maintaining her facade of eight-bit innocence. <words>273</words> The paint itself was liquified data from erased beings, their essence crying out through artistic vandalism. <words>290</words>

The footsteps ceased. <words>293</words> Princess Elektra materialized behind him, her sprite flickering between her public avatar and something far more sinister, a mass of consuming code with crown-shaped teeth. <words>319</words> "Necromancers always dig too deep," she said, her voice layered with stolen sound files. <words>334</words>

But Morthis had already triggered his plan. <words>341</words> The fishhook wasn't just glowing; it was broadcasting, streaming the mural's decoded evidence across every screen in their pixelated realm. <words>361</words> As NPCs everywhere witnessed the truth, Elektra's perfect image fragmented, her power source disrupted by collective disbelief. <words>378</words>

The echoing footsteps returned, but now they belonged to liberated programs converging on their exposed deceiver. <words>394</words> Morthis stepped back into the shadows, his nervous nature finally justified, his bizarre gift having served its ultimate purpose: resurrection of the truth itself. <words>419</words> The old gods would wake to find their avatar dethroned, their comfortable slumber interrupted by the very transparency they had tried to delete. <words>443</words>
