The blank-faced performer sat beneath the giant ferns, their fronds casting latticed shadows while waterfalls thundered overhead, creating a perpetual mist that made the orchard shimmer like a half-remembered dream. <words>30</words> She wore a plain plastic ring on her index finger, unremarkable except for how it caught moonlight filtering through the canopy—a tool for tracking moon paths across the sky, essential for her peculiar vocation. <words>60</words>

As guardian of rumors, she collected whispers that floated between sleeping minds and waking thoughts, each one requiring approval before it could manifest in the world. <words>85</words> Her methods were uniquely typical of her kind: methodical yet incomprehensible to outsiders, like reading sheet music written in water droplets. <words>105</words>

The piano sat incongruously among the prehistoric ferns, its ivory keys green with moss, its strings humming with the vibration of falling water. <words>128</words> During her daily practice, she didn't play notes but rather pressed keys in patterns that corresponded to lunar trajectories she'd memorized over decades. <words>151</words> Each chord opened a different channel to the dream language she desperately sought to master—that ancient tongue spoken only by those who walk between consciousness and sleep. <words>178</words>

Tonight's moon path curved through the constellation of the Whisperer, and she tracked its arc with her ring, the cheap plastic somehow attuned to celestial mechanics through sheer repetition of use. <words>209</words> Her blank face never changed expression, even as rumors swirled through her consciousness like schools of luminous fish: a child's nightmare about losing teeth, a widow's dream of her husband returning, a merchant's anxiety transformed into visions of empty shelves. <words>250</words>

She approved only the harmless ones, letting them slip into tomorrow's conversations as déjà vu, coincidences, and hunches. <words>267</words> The dangerous rumors—those that could unravel certainty or plant seeds of beautiful madness—she held back, storing them in the space between piano notes. <words>291</words>

The waterfalls sang their ancient percussion while she practiced, her fingers finding harmonies that existed nowhere in traditional music theory. <words>311</words> This was her uniquely typical approach: using the mundane tools of performance to achieve the extraordinary task of dream interpretation. <words>331</words> The plain plastic ring grew warm as the moon reached its apex, and suddenly she understood a phrase in the dream language—not its meaning, but its texture, its weight in the sleeping mind. <words>365</words>

She approved this knowledge with a subtle nod, filing it alongside thousands of other fragments she'd collected in this twilight profession. <words>387</words> Tomorrow, during piano practice, she would track new moon paths, guard new rumors, and perhaps decode another syllable of the language that bridges sleep and waking, madness and precision, the ordinary and the impossible. <words>420</words> The blank-faced performer closed the piano lid gently, water droplets from the falls creating their own music on its surface. <words>440</words> In this orchard of giant ferns, she was both student and sentinel, forever learning the grammar of dreams. <words>458</words>
