The morose paladin stood at the solar flare observatory's lavishly austere control panel, watching darkness eat the city below. <words>16</words> It had been three centuries since humanity named the last star, and now even those ancient lights were failing. <words>34</words> 

Brother Kaine fingered the dull sewing needle in his pocket—his order's sacred tool for mending what technology could not. <words>54</words> The observatory's systems had been dying for decades, each failure bringing visible changes to the world outside: colors draining from sunsets, shadows losing their edges, reality itself unraveling at its seams. <words>85</words>

The city-wide blackout wasn't supposed to happen for another week. <words>96</words> He'd calculated it perfectly, had prepared to confine the decay within the observatory's quantum barriers before it spread. <words>114</words> But the universe, apparently, was bored with his schedule. <words>124</words>

A woman materialized from the emergency stairwell, her lab coat phosphorescent with residual energy. <words>139</words> "You're early," Dr. Lena Voss said, her voice carrying that same bored excitement he felt—the thrill of apocalypse worn thin by repetition. <words>162</words>

"The blackout accelerated things," Kaine replied, pulling out the needle. <words>172</words> Its dullness was deceptive; only something so humble could pierce the veil between broken code and living memory. <words>191</words>

"The restoration protocols?" <words>194</words> she asked. <words>196</words>

"Ancient systems require ancient methods." <words>201</words> He gestured to the observatory's core, where reality flickered like bad reception. <words>214</words> "We confine the corruption here, then I stitch it back together, star by star." <words>229</words>

They worked in the lavishly austere space—walls of pure mathematics, floors of compressed light, everything essential and nothing more. <words>249</words> Lena activated the containment field while Kaine threaded the needle with quantum filament, each movement practiced yet weighted with cosmic exhaustion. <words>271</words>

The visible changes began immediately. <words>276</words> Where his needle passed, stars reignited in the observatory's holographic dome—not new stars, but memories of old ones, restored from the universe's backup files. <words>301</words> Each stitch pulled reality tighter, confining chaos to manageable pockets. <words>311</words>

"Strange," Lena murmured, watching colors bloom back into existence, "how saving the universe feels so routine now." <words>329</words>

Kaine nodded, his morose expression unchanging even as galaxies reformed beneath his fingers. <words>343</words> This was his calling, his burden—to be endlessly excited by the prospect of restoration while simultaneously bored by its necessity. <words>364</words>

By dawn, the city's lights flickered back online, citizens unaware that their chance encounter during the blackout had prevented reality's final unraveling. <words>387</words> The paladin pocketed his dull needle, already calculating when the next failure would occur. <words>402</words> 

The last star had been named, but the first would need constant mending. <words>416</words> Forever. <words>417</words>
