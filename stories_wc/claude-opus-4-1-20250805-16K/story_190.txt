Marcus Chen pressed his fingertips against the glass case containing the pressed butterfly, its wings frozen mid-flight like sheet music waiting to be played. <words>18</words> The drought prediction center hummed with machinery that could forecast rain patterns months in advance, but Marcus wasn't here for meteorology. <words>38</words> He was a cautious smuggler of something far more valuable than contraband: extracted memories that sang when touched. <words>56</words>

"The painter's coming out of anesthesia," Dr. Reeves announced with the peculiar enthusiasm of someone who'd stopped caring years ago. <words>76</words> Marcus nodded, his movements both calculated and spontaneous—a meticulously impulsive dance he'd perfected over decades of illegal empathy harvesting. <words>95</words> The butterfly wasn't just decoration; it was his tool, pressed with a special coating that resonated with musical memories leaked during delirious confessions. <words>118</words>

Behind the observation window, the painter stirred. <words>125</words> "I can hear colors," she mumbled, her words slurring together. <words>135</words> "My mother's voice was vermillion, but I painted it cerulean because I couldn't stand the heat of truth." <words>153</words> Marcus placed the butterfly against the glass, and immediately, a melody began forming—not in his ears, but somewhere deeper. <words>173</words>

The drought center's legitimate purpose masked its secondary function perfectly. <words>183</words> Who would suspect that predicting emotional droughts in human souls happened alongside atmospheric moisture analysis? <words>198</words> Marcus had chosen this career specifically to access these moments when people's guards dissolved completely. <words>214</words>

"Every brushstroke was my father's disappointment," the painter continued, her confession painting itself in musical notes that only Marcus could harvest. <words>235</words> "I mixed his ashes into titanium white, used him to highlight my self-portraits." <words>249</words> The butterfly's wings seemed to flutter against the glass, though it had been dead for years. <words>266</words>

Marcus didn't judge—that would require caring in a conventional way. <words>276</words> His enthusiasm existed purely for the collection process, the transformation of raw confession into something he could predict, map, understand. <words>296</words> Each stolen memory-song brought him closer to his goal: becoming a master of empathy without ever truly feeling it himself. <words>316</words>

"The drought," the painter gasped suddenly, still unconscious but somehow aware. <words>327</words> "It's not coming to the land—it's already in our hearts, spreading like watercolor on wet paper." <words>344</words> Marcus smiled, neither warm nor cold, and carefully removed the butterfly from the glass. <words>359</words> Its wings now held a new composition, a symphony of suppressed grief that would fetch an excellent price from collectors who craved authentic human experience without the mess of living it. <words>390</words>

As the painter's confession ended and consciousness returned, Marcus pocketed his treasure and walked away, whistling a tune he'd stolen from someone else's childhood. <words>414</words> The drought prediction center continued its work, measuring absence in all its forms. <words>428</words> Tomorrow, another patient would arrive, another memory would sing, and Marcus would press it all between glass wings, preserved forever in enthusiastic indifference. <words>451</words>
