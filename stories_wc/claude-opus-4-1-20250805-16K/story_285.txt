The swordsman's breath crystallized in the arctic air as he stumbled through the ice-encrusted apple trees, their branches twisted into grotesque shapes by decades of frozen wind. <words>23</words> Steam from nearby geothermal vents created ghostly pillars that vanished moments after forming, much like his fading anger at the Council's betrayal. <words>44</words> His naturally awkward gait, made worse by frost-numbed feet, sent him careening between the gnarled trunks. <words>61</words>

In his trembling hand, he clutched a blank postcard—the final piece of evidence that would restore the old ways, if only he could reach the archive before the Council sealed it forever. <words>93</words> The postcard itself was unremarkable, but its emptiness spoke volumes: it had been enchanted to hold memories between worlds, waiting for the right hermit crab of a soul to inhabit its surface. <words>125</words>

He hesitated at every shadow, his sword half-drawn then resheathed, uncertain whether the shapes emerging from the steam were friend or foe. <words>147</words> The orchard had become a bridge between the physical realm and something older, more traditional—a place where the ancient protocols still mattered. <words>170</words> Here, where fire and ice coexisted in impossible harmony, the veil between worlds grew tissue-thin. <words>186</words>

Like hermit crabs abandoning shells for larger homes, thoughts from the other side began to emerge through his consciousness, each one more urgent than the last. <words>213</words> They whispered of the old ceremonies, the proper ways of succession, the rituals his people had abandoned for bureaucratic efficiency. <words>233</words> His awkwardness suddenly made sense—he had been born to straddle both worlds, never quite fitting in either. <words>250</words>

The archive keeper would arrive soon to file away the final piece of evidence, destroying any chance of proving the Council's illegitimacy. <words>272</words> His resentment flared and faded like the steam around him, ephemeral yet sharp enough to cut. <words>288</words> They had taken everything: his master, his certainty, his place in the world. <words>301</words>

But as another consciousness emerged through him—an ancient judge who had once walked these same frozen paths—he understood. <words>319</words> The postcard began to shimmer, images flowing across its surface like migrating souls seeking new vessels. <words>335</words> Each image revealed another piece of the Council's deception, another violation of sacred law. <words>349</words>

He no longer hesitated. <words>353</words> Drawing his sword with newfound purpose, he carved symbols into the ice between the thermal vents, creating a summoning circle as his ancestors had taught. <words>378</words> The bridge between worlds solidified, and through it came the evidence's true guardians—those who remembered when tradition meant survival, not mere ceremony. <words>401</words>

When the archive keeper arrived at dawn, the postcard would already be filed—not in their sterile vaults, but in the living memory of two worlds reconnected. <words>428</words> The swordsman's awkward dance between realms had become a graceful emergence, restoring what had been carelessly discarded. <words>445</words> His anger dissipated with the morning steam, leaving only cold satisfaction and warm purpose. <words>459</words>
