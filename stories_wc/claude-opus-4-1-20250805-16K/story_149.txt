Marcus wore his leather jacket and facial piercings like armor, the conventionally rebellious uniform of a generation that mistook aesthetic for revolution. <words>17</words> He clutched a wilted paper flower—origami once white, now yellowed and soft from years in his pocket—as he stepped through the laundromat's fluorescent threshold. <words>42</words> 

The washing machines hummed their midnight chorus when she appeared: an old woman folding impossible fabrics that shifted between textures with glimmering transitions. <words>66</words> "You're late," she said, though they'd never met. <words>74</words> "The Giant's study awaits between scenes." <words>80</words>

Marcus wanted to run, to maintain his careful distance from anything beyond comprehension, but his feet carried him through the dryer door she held open. <words>105</words> The metal portal expanded into a vast chamber where bookshelves climbed toward clouds, where desk drawers opened onto constellations. <words>124</words> Here, in the spaces between one moment and the next, reality revealed its seams. <words>138</words>

"Every prophet begins by trying to estrange themselves from their calling," the woman said, her voice echoing off furniture scaled for beings who could pluck stars like berries. <words>166</words> "You've spent years pushing people away with your practiced rebellion, your safe nonconformity." <words>180</words> 

She gestured to the wilted flower in his hand. <words>189</words> "Your mother made that before she understood what you would become." <words>200</words> The paper petals began to glow, each crease holding memories of minds scattered across dimensions, consciousness fragmented by the weight of existence. <words>222</words>

Marcus felt them all—thousands of isolated thoughts yearning for connection, for someone to show them they weren't alone in their displacement. <words>242</words> The sensation should have been overwhelming, but instead it filled him with a haunting delight, a terrible joy at finally understanding his purpose. <words>265</words>

"Between every scene of reality," the woman explained, "between every heartbeat and blink, this study exists. <words>281</words> The Giant left it for unlikely prophets like you—those who look like rebels but carry ancient flowers, who seem to push away but secretly long to gather." <words>308</words>

The laundromat reformed around them, machines still spinning their hypnotic cycles. <words>319</words> But Marcus saw it differently now—saw the glimmering transitions between spin and rinse, between dirty and clean, between separate and unified. <words>340</words> 

He understood that his piercings and leather were just costume, that true rebellion meant accepting his role as shepherd to scattered minds. <words>361</words> The wilted paper flower crumbled in his palm, releasing spores of light that drifted through the ventilation, seeking the lonely, the disconnected, the ready. <words>385</words>

Tomorrow, they would begin arriving at this 24-hour laundromat, drawn by dreams of belonging. <words>399</words> Marcus would be waiting, an unlikely prophet in the most mundane of sanctuaries, teaching them to see the Giant's study that existed between every moment, unifying what was scattered under the single vision of connection. <words>434</words>
