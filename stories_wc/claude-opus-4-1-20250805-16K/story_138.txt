Lord Ashworth hadn't spoken his title aloud in seventeen years, not since the spontaneous combustion lab claimed his estate's east wing. <words>18</words> Now he stood among the scorched equipment, watching his artificial hummingbird drone flit between blackened beakers, its ruby throat catching fluorescent light that shouldn't exist here anymore. <words>46</words>

The drone paused, hovering with mysteriously obvious intent over a drawer he'd never noticed. <words>61</words> Inside: thousands of old ticket stubs from the lab's public tours, before everything burned, before everyone forgot his family funded this research into human self-immolation. <words>86</words>

His phone buzzed. <words>89</words> Sarah again: "Meeting in five?" <words>94</words>

He began reassembling the ticket stubs into a timeline, each torn edge a small moment of candor—admissions paid, dates stamped, perforations that told truth. <words>118</words> Between her text and his inevitable reply, he would fortify himself with evidence. <words>131</words> The university claimed no records survived, that his family's contribution was rumor, illusion. <words>144</words>

Another buzz: "They're saying you never owned anything." <words>152</words>

His fingers moved with hollow recklessness, arranging stubs dated the day before the fire. <words>166</words> Forty-seven visitors. <words>168</words> His grandmother's signature authorizing the tour. <words>174</words> The hummingbird drone recorded everything, its mechanical memory untainted by the convenient amnesia that infected human witnesses. <words>190</words>

The pattern emerged as he worked—tours increased whenever his family invested more, stopped completely two days before the combustion. <words>209</words> Someone had known. <words>212</words> Someone had cleared the building. <words>217</words>

"Hello?" <words>218</words> Sarah's third message. <words>221</words>

The drone's footage would cut through their illusions, these administrators who pretended his bloodline hadn't built their careers on studying why humans sometimes erupted into flames without warning. <words>248</words> Each stub he placed was a small rebellion against their revision of history. <words>261</words>

He thought of his grandfather, consumed instantly at his desk, leaving only shadows and questions. <words>276</words> The investigation called it spontaneous, but these tickets suggested scheduled tours had been mysteriously cancelled that exact day. <words>294</words>

Between Sarah's growing impatience and his methodical reconstruction, Lord Ashworth felt the weight of forgotten nobility—not the title, but the obligation to remember when others chose profitable amnesia. <words>322</words> The hummingbird drone whirred, uploading its discoveries to servers that existed outside the university's reach. <words>337</words>

His phone lit up with Sarah's fourth text: "They're going to demolish it tomorrow." <words>351</words>

He surveyed his mosaic of stubs, this fortification built from discarded evidence. <words>363</words> Each ticket held someone's decision to witness what his family had created, before fire made forgetting so convenient. <words>381</words> The drone settled on his shoulder, its mechanical heart thrumming with recorded truth. <words>394</words>

Lord Ashworth finally replied: "I'm already here." <words>401</words> He struck a match, watching it burn down to his fingers, understanding at last why some things choose to combust—sometimes destroying illusions requires hollow recklessness and careful documentation in equal measure. <words>433</words>

The drone flew toward the door, leading him out. <words>442</words> Behind them, the ticket stubs remained arranged in their perfect, damning constellation. <words>454</words>
