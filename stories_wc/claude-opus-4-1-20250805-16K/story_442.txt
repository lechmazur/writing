Marcus pressed his calloused thumb against the torn corner of a flyer, the only fragment remaining from twenty years ago when he'd first answered that impossible job posting. <words>24</words> The giant mushroom house groaned around him, its bioluminescent walls pulsing with a rhythm that matched neither his heartbeat nor his memories. <words>45</words>

"Time to vectorize the final coordinates," he muttered, checking his synchronized watch against the three others strapped to his forearm. <words>65</words> Each showed a different time, yet all were correct—a paradox he'd grown comfortingly accustomed to in this place where linear thinking meant madness. <words>89</words>

The windmill outside creaked its death song, visible through the mushroom's translucent flesh like a shadow puppet show of rust and resignation. <words>111</words> Marcus had counted forty-three thousand rotations since arriving, though his memories insisted it had been both yesterday and several lifetimes ago. <words>133</words>

He was an edgy tradesman by nature, hired to fix things that couldn't exist, paid in currencies that dissolved upon receipt. <words>155</words> The torn flyer fragment in his pocket promised "steady work for those who embrace uncertainty," but the ink kept rearranging itself, showing different words each time he looked. <words>184</words>

"The candle," whispered the mushroom's spores, a chorus of microscopic pessimists. <words>195</words> "You must carry it through." <words>200</words>

Marcus laughed bitterly, remembering—or perhaps pre-remembering—the endless void that awaited beyond the final door. <words>214</words> The flickering candle sat on his workbench, its flame bending in directions that shouldn't exist, casting shadows of memories that hadn't happened yet. <words>238</words>

His synchronized watches chimed in perfect discord. <words>245</words> The windmill's final rotation had begun. <words>251</words>

With practiced movements, Marcus began to vectorize the space around him, folding reality into neat mathematical coordinates that his distorted memories could navigate. <words>275</words> The mushroom house contracted and expanded simultaneously, breathing him deeper into its fungal consciousness where past and future sprouted from the same mycelial network. <words>300</words>

"Nothing matters," he said cheerfully, picking up the candle, "which is precisely why everything does." <words>315</words> The flame flickered, showing him glimpses of the void—not empty, but full of forgotten windmills, each making their final rotation eternally. <words>337</words>

The torn corner of the flyer crumbled to dust in his pocket, its purpose finally fulfilled or perhaps never begun. <words>358</words> Marcus stepped through the threshold, his synchronized watches stopping and starting in beautiful chaos, carrying the candle into the blurry vividness of nowhere. <words>382</words>

Behind him, the giant mushroom house sighed with ancient contentment, already forgetting he'd ever existed, already remembering his inevitable return. <words>402</words> The windmill completed its rotation and began another final turn, because in places where memory distorts, endings are just beginnings wearing different masks. <words>426</words>

Marcus walked on, his tradesman's boots echoing in the soundless void, the candle's flame his only compass in the comforting pessimism of infinite possibility. <words>450</words>
