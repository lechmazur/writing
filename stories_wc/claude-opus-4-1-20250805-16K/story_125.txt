Marcus stood at the boundary of his family's farmland, staring at the rusted hulk of the abandoned space station control room that had crashed here decades before anyone remembered. <words>28</words> The property was being sold tomorrow, and with it, any chance of understanding why his exceptionally usual magic—telekinesis limited to moving pencils, fire spells that barely warmed tea—felt so wrong. <words>57</words> Another misdelivered package sat at his feet, the third this week, each addressed to "The Heir of Station Seven." <words>76</words> He'd opened them with bored excitement, that peculiar feeling of going through motions while hoping for miracles. <words>93</words> The first held star charts. <words>98</words> The second, quantum equations written in his grandmother's hand. <words>107</words> This third box rattled. <words>111</words>

Inside, nestled in synthetic foam, lay a doll head with blinking eyes that tracked his movement with unsettling precision. <words>130</words> Marcus nearly dropped it when the eyes flashed purple—the exact shade his failed spells always produced. <words>147</words> His grandmother's stories rushed back: how she'd worked the agricultural stations before the exodus, how she'd married a "grounder" and never spoke of why she'd stayed behind. <words>175</words> The doll's mouth moved. <words>179</words> "Heritage Protocol activated. <words>182</words> Scan complete. <words>184</words> You have limited yourself to terrestrial magic forms." <words>192</words>

Marcus laughed, a sound caught between frustration and relief. <words>201</words> Of course. <words>203</words> He'd been trying to spring a trap on his own limitations by practicing harder, never realizing the limitations weren't his—they were Earth's. <words>226</words> He carried the head into the control room, its eyes now projecting a path through the debris. <words>243</words> The ancient panels hummed to life at his approach, recognizing something in him that Earth's magic teachers never had. <words>262</words> His purple energy wasn't failed fire magic; it was stellar manipulation, meant for navigating void-streams between stars. <words>279</words> His weak telekinesis wasn't weak at all—it was precisely calibrated for zero-gravity engineering. <words>293</words>

The doll head spoke again: "Training simulation prepared. <words>301</words> Will you reclaim your heritage?" <words>306</words>

Marcus placed his palm on the activation panel, feeling his magic shift and expand like lungs taking their first real breath. <words>327</words> The control room's displays unveiled star maps, migration routes, and his grandmother's true name: Station Commander Lyra Seven. <words>345</words> She hadn't been left behind; she'd stayed to preserve this waystation, to ensure her descendants could choose their path. <words>364</words> The farmland would be sold tomorrow, but Marcus finally understood—his heritage wasn't in the soil. <words>379</words> It was in the stars his exceptionally usual magic had been reaching for all along. <words>394</words> The doll's eyes blinked once more, and the room filled with starlight. <words>406</words>
