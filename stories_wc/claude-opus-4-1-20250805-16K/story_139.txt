Brother Kael's eyes snapped open in the swaying aerial gondola, the dream's bitter taste still coating his tongue like ash from forgotten incense. <words>24</words> In that heartbeat after the dream returned—the same nightmare that had haunted him for seven years—he finally understood what the shadow-monk in his visions meant. <words>50</words> His fingers found the creased shipping label tucked against the visually unappealing flute, its bamboo surface scarred and blackened by fire, nothing like the pristine instruments displayed in monastery collections. <words>80</words> The label bore his own handwriting from a decade past: "Return to sender—item cursed." <words>94</words>

The gondola creaked through mountain mist, cables singing their metallic hymn as Kael held the flute to the lantern light. <words>114</words> There—tooth marks pressed deep into the mouthpiece, each indentation a testament to desperate music played through clenched jaw. <words>132</words> He recognized the pattern immediately; his own teeth had left identical marks on practice flutes during his novice years, when stubborn determination drove him to play through exhaustion and pain. <words>162</words> But these marks were different, twisted somehow, as if made by someone playing backwards melodies, inverting sacred songs into something profane. <words>184</words>

"Harvesting the past," he whispered, remembering the elder's final teaching before the monastery burned. <words>198</words> The shadow-monk in his dreams wasn't prophecy but memory—his own dark reflection from the timeline where he'd chosen vengeance over forgiveness. <words>219</words> That other Kael had sent this flute forward through time, a message encoded in saliva and bamboo, warning and weapon both. <words>241</words>

The gondola shuddered, ice crystals forming on the windows despite the summer season. <words>254</words> His reflection in the frost-covered glass smiled with too many teeth. <words>265</words> The other Kael had found him. <words>271</words>

With trembling reverence, Kael raised the ugly flute to his lips, tasting the ancient bitterness where his doppelganger's mouth had pressed. <words>292</words> The tooth marks guided his embouchure perfectly—a lock accepting its twisted key. <words>304</words> He played the monastery's sacred mourning song backwards, each note unweaving the curse his shadow-self had woven. <words>321</words> The reflection screamed silently, fracturing like poorly fired pottery. <words>330</words>

To avenge the brothers lost in flames, he'd once believed, required blood and fury. <words>344</words> But this older Kael, stubborn in compassion rather than rage, understood that true vengeance meant denying his darkness its victory. <words>364</words> The flute's final note dissolved his shadow-self like morning mist, leaving only the scarred bamboo and its creased label as proof of what almost was. <words>390</words>

The gondola descended toward green valleys, carrying a monk who'd finally learned that outsmarting your own dark reflection meant choosing the harder path—forgiveness over the easy seduction of revenge. <words>419</words> The flute would return to the monastery's ruins, where Kael would plant it like a seed, growing bamboo from the ashes of two possible futures, harvesting hope from the darkest past. <words>451</words>
