Mira descended into the forgotten underwater city market, her diviner's tools rattling against vintage photographs sealed in waterproof cases. <words>19</words> She moved through the drowned stalls with practiced indifference, though her pulse quickened at each temporal ripple. <words>36</words> The echo of regret hung here like brine—confusingly clear in its message: someone had altered the timelines. <words>54</words>

She'd discovered it through social media posts that shouldn't exist. <words>64</words> A Instagram account from 2019 showing this market thriving above water. <words>75</words> A TikTok from 2023 where the city never sank. <words>84</words> Each post timestamped from parallel timelines, bleeding through like light through cracked glass. <words>97</words>

Mira touched a barnacle-crusted vendor table, and visions flooded her shy mind. <words>109</words> In one timeline, a merchant sold these same vintage photographs here, capturing moments before the precipitate disaster. <words>126</words> In another, the photographs never aged, remaining perpetually new while their subjects grew old above the waves. <words>143</words>

The cosmic imbalance wasn't subtle—someone had been timeline-shopping, stealing moments from realities where loved ones survived. <words>160</words> She recognized the pattern in the social media trail: desperate parents posting photos of children who drowned here, except in their posts, the children lived. <words>185</words> The universe groaned under these borrowed lives. <words>192</words>

Mira spread the vintage photographs across a coral-eaten counter, each one a window to what was, is, or could have been. <words>213</words> Her fingers trembled—not from cold but from the weight of what she must precipitate. <words>227</words> To right the balance meant returning every stolen moment, condemning those children to their original fates. <words>243</words>

She began the ritual with detached precision, though her heart screamed. <words>254</words> The photographs lifted, suspended in the underwater current, arranging themselves into a mandala of possibility. <words>269</words> Through them, she could see the social media posts flickering, rewriting themselves, erasing hope. <words>283</words>

"Forgive me," she whispered to no one, to everyone. <words>292</words> The shy diviner who avoided crowds now held the attention of infinite timelines. <words>305</words>

As she spoke the binding words, the echo of regret transformed—no longer past tense but present, immediate, hers. <words>323</words> The photographs dissolved, their images returning to their proper timelines like letters to dead addresses. <words>338</words> The social media posts vanished one by one, taking with them the false comfort of survival. <words>354</words>

The market settled into its proper state of abandonment. <words>363</words> Mira collected her tools with the same passionate disinterest she'd cultivated since accepting this burden. <words>378</words> She'd restored the cosmic balance, but the echo would follow her across every timeline she'd touched. <words>394</words> Some things, once heard, could never be unheard. <words>402</words> Swimming upward, she left the underwater city market to its ghosts, knowing she'd traded their peace for the universe's stability. <words>422</words>
