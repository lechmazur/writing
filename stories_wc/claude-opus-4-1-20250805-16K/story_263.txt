Brother Tide never considered himself evil, despite the Council's propaganda painting him as the coral reef city's most notorious zealot assassin. <words>18</words> His webbed fingers traced the faded carnival prize plush—a dolphin won decades ago at the surface world's last fair before the Great Submersion. <words>40</words> Through the crystalline walls of his sanctum, schools of neon fish performed their nature walks, their daily migrations through the city's living architecture. <words>63</words> 

"Every hero's tale needs proper perspective," he mused, pressing the dolphin's worn belly. <words>77</words> The toy emitted reversed echoes—sounds playing backward through time, revealing conversations that shaped his transformation from devoted priest to methodical killer. <words>99</words> First came the Council's decree: "The surface sympathizers threaten our pure underwater evolution." <words>112</words> Then, earlier still: "Brother Tide shows such promise in our moral teachings." <words>124</words> Finally, the earliest echo: a child's laughter as he won the dolphin, before the oceans rose. <words>141</words>

He'd consolidated seventeen resistance cells into one manageable target, all while maintaining his calculatedly playful demeanor. <words>157</words> "Assassination is just aggressive negotiation," he'd joke at confessionals, making the faithful laugh nervously while he memorized their secrets. <words>176</words> The irony wasn't lost on him—a holy man using prayer booths as intelligence networks. <words>191</words>

Today marked the epic's climax, though history would record it differently. <words>202</words> The Council called him their divine instrument; the resistance named him a monster. <words>216</words> Both missed the point entirely. <words>221</words> Through his apartment's bio-luminescent windows, he watched citizens beginning their morning nature walks, following the reef's natural pathways while pretending their city wasn't built on drowned bones. <words>249</words>

The dolphin's reversed echoes revealed one final sound—his sister's voice: "Promise you'll remember who we were before the waters changed us." <words>271</words> He had promised, which was precisely why he'd accepted the Council's bloody commission. <words>285</words> Someone needed to remember the surface world's sins, even if that meant becoming one himself. <words>301</words>

His targets would gather soon at the Memorial Gardens, where plastic flowers from the old world grew among real coral. <words>321</words> They'd expect a martyr's death, something noble for their cause. <words>332</words> Instead, he'd give them something better—a villain so perfectly crafted that their story would survive centuries. <words>349</words> Every revolution needed its monster, and Brother Tide had volunteered. <words>359</words>

He tucked the plush dolphin into his vestments, its synthetic fabric alien against his scaled skin. <words>376</words> "The reflection of morality," he whispered, "is just morality viewed from below the surface." <words>391</words> With practiced grace, he swam toward his final performance, humming an old carnival tune in reverse. <words>408</words> The coral city's greatest joke was about to reach its punchline—a holy assassin who saved the world by damning himself. <words>429</words>

After all, someone had to be the villain in their underwater paradise's founding myth. <words>444</words> Brother Tide had simply volunteered first. <words>450</words>
