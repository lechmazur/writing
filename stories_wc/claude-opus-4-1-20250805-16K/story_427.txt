The lighthouse's spiral staircase groaned beneath Erasmus Pike's mechanical arm as he ascended, clutching the single sock that had once belonged to his rival. <words>20</words> In the dueling circles of Neo-Athens, philosophers settled disputes through combat, but Pike sought something far more dangerous: to become a weaver of dreams, to literally sculpt the unconscious. <words>48</words>

His bronze fingers traced the sock's frayed edges—a tangibly abstract artifact, somehow both mundane and metaphysically charged with its owner's essence. <words>69</words> Professor Vaughn had worn it during their last duel, when Pike's flesh arm was crushed beneath the weight of a collapsing syllogism made manifest. <words>94</words> Now, three years later, Pike had learned to deconstruct reality itself through his mechanical appendage, each gear calibrated to unravel the threads between waking and sleeping. <words>120</words>

The abandoned lighthouse served as his laboratory, where shifting equilibria between conscious thought and dream-logic created pockets of malleable space. <words>140</words> Tonight, he would finally attempt the synthesis. <words>147</words>

"You're trembling," whispered Vaughn's voice from the shadows. <words>155</words>

Pike spun, his mechanical arm whirring defensively. <words>162</words> His former mentor stood impossibly present, though Pike knew he'd been dead for months. <words>176</words>

"A projection," Pike muttered, coded desperation bleeding through his words. <words>185</words> "You're just—"

"The first successful dream you've woven," Vaughn finished. <words>193</words> "Using my sock as an anchor. <words>199</words> Clever, but you've trapped yourself in the paradox." <words>207</words>

The lighthouse walls began breathing, expanding and contracting like lung tissue. <words>218</words> Pike's mechanical fingers sparked as he tried to deconstruct the manifestation, but Vaughn stepped closer. <words>233</words>

"You killed me," Vaughn said softly. <words>239</words> "Not in our duel, but after. <words>245</words> The poison in my tea." <words>250</words>

Pike's human hand shook violently. <words>255</words> Under this duress, the secret he'd buried erupted: "You were going to expose the dream-weaving research to the Council! <words>273</words> They would have destroyed everything!" <words>278</words>

"And now you've become everything you feared," Vaughn replied, gesturing to the warping lighthouse. <words>292</words> "A dream eating its own dreamer." <words>298</words>

The sock in Pike's mechanical hand began unraveling, each thread pulling apart the boundaries between dimensions. <words>314</words> He could feel his consciousness fragmenting, spreading across infinite possible lighthouses, infinite confrontations with his guilt. <words>330</words>

Then, unexpectedly, applause echoed from nowhere—slow, deliberate clapping that shouldn't exist in this collapsing reality. <words>345</words> At the hush of this unexpected applause, Pike understood: he had succeeded in becoming a dream-weaver, but the dream he'd woven was his own judgment. <words>371</words>

His mechanical arm reached for the final thread of the sock, knowing that pulling it would either complete his transformation or scatter him across the unconscious forever. <words>398</words> The lighthouse beam suddenly blazed to life above them, sweeping across an ocean of sleeping minds, and Pike made his choice. <words>419</words>

He pulled. <words>421</words>

The distinction between philosopher and dream, between metal and flesh, between guilt and absolution, dissolved into the turning light. <words>439</words>

Pike became what he'd always feared and desired: a living paradox, forever dueling himself in others' dreams. <words>456</words>
