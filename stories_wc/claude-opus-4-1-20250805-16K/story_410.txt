Brother Marcus hadn't spoken to another soul in seven years, which made his current conversation with a mushroom perfectly reasonable. <words>17</words>

"The water pipes are dying," he told the glowing fungus, snipping its phosphorescent cap with his blunt scissors—a tool so dull it couldn't cut butter, yet strangely effective at harvesting the cavern cathedral's luminous flora. <words>51</words>

The vast underground sanctuary pulsed with blue-green light from thousands of bioluminescent plants, their glow revealing ancient stone arches that disappeared into darkness. <words>75</words>

Marcus, an astute hermit who'd once engineered city water systems, had retreated here after the surface world's collapse. <words>93</words>

Now, the underground river that fed this miraculous ecosystem was failing. <words>104</words>

"Ironic, isn't it?" he chuckled darkly to his fungal audience. <words>114</words>

"I fled humanity to preserve my sanity, and now I'll die of thirst in the most beautiful tomb imaginable." <words>133</words>

His scissors scraped against stone—that awful sound that would've made others cringe, but to Marcus, it had become a symphony of solitude. <words>156</words>

The impact of isolation had rewired his brain in fascinating ways. <words>167</words>

He could hear water flowing through rock formations three levels down, smell mineral deposits like a sommelier detecting notes in wine. <words>188</words>

But today, something else invaded his carefully cultivated silence. <words>197</words>

The scent of fresh bread. <words>202</words>

Marcus froze. <words>204</words>

His mind, starved of human contact, began to amplify the impossible aroma until it overwhelmed every other sensation. <words>222</words>

Bread meant ovens. <words>225</words>

Ovens meant civilization. <words>228</words>

Civilization meant... <words>230</words>

The ancient freight elevator—dead for decades—suddenly groaned to life. <words>239</words>

Marcus scrambled toward the shaft, his blunt scissors clutched like a talisman. <words>251</words>

The bread scent grew stronger, mixing with machine oil and electricity. <words>262</words>

When the elevator arrived at his empty floor, its doors creaked open to reveal... nothing. <words>278</words>

Just a single loaf, still warm, sitting on the floor. <words>289</words>

Marcus laughed—a sound like gravel in a blender. <words>298</words>

"Seven years of mushroom therapy, and I'm finally hallucinating carbohydrates!" <words>308</words>

But the bread was real. <words>313</words>

Attached was a water-stained note: "Reservoir Seven restored. You're not as alone as you think. —The Upper Caves." <words>332</words>

Marcus bit into the loaf, tears streaming down his weathered face. <words>343</words>

The bread's warmth amplified something he'd buried beneath years of purposeful solitude—hope. <words>355</words>

"Well," he told the glowing ceiling, already planning his journey upward, "turns out my strangely effective scissors might cut through more than mushrooms." <words>378</words>

He pocketed the tool and entered the elevator. <words>386</words>

"They might just cut through this damned loneliness too." <words>395</words>

The doors closed on his phosphorescent paradise, carrying him toward whatever broken water systems—and broken humans—awaited above. <words>412</words>
