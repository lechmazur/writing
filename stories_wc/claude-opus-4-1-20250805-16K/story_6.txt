Kalros the minstrel stood in the abandoned disappearing ink factory, fingering the dragon-scale armor scrap he'd won from the immortal trickster Vex three centuries ago—or so Vex claimed, though Kalros remained skeptical of everything, especially immortals with too many pockets. <words>42</words> The factory's ancient steam vent hissed its noon greeting, that peculiar moment when the mailbox outside went silent, no longer rattling with phantom letters that never arrived. <words>69</words> 

"You actually came," Vex materialized from the ink-stained shadows, his grin stretching impossibly wide. <words>83</words> "Ready to lose that precious scale?" <words>89</words>

Kalros laughed, a sound like coins falling into an empty well. <words>100</words> "I've discovered your weakness, old fraud." <words>106</words> The minstrel pulled out his lute, its strings already humming with barely contained magic. <words>120</words> "You can't resist a wager involving reckless generosity—it's the one impossibly plausible thing about you." <words>135</words>

The steam vent's hiss grew louder, almost melodic. <words>143</words> Kalros had spent months studying this place, learning how the abandoned machinery sang at precisely midday, when the world held its breath. <words>165</words> 

"I propose a contest," Kalros announced, loading the dragon-scale into a makeshift slingshot fashioned from lute strings. <words>182</words> "I'll destroy this priceless artifact—shoot it straight into that steam vent where it'll dissolve into nothing." <words>198</words> He aimed carefully at the hissing opening. <words>205</words> "Unless you give away your immortality to the first mortal who walks through that door." <words>220</words>

Vex's eyes widened with something between horror and delight. <words>229</words> "You wouldn't dare waste such a treasure!" <words>236</words>

"Wouldn't I?" <words>238</words> Kalros drew back the slingshot, the scale gleaming with otherworldly fire. <words>249</words> "Three seconds to decide." <words>253</words>

The factory held its breath. <words>258</words> The steam vent hissed its ancient song. <words>265</words> Vex's fingers twitched toward his pockets, then stopped. <words>273</words> 

"You magnificent bastard," the trickster whispered with irreverent awe. <words>282</words> "You know I can't resist such absurd generosity—giving away either immortality or watching you destroy the last proof dragons existed." <words>302</words> His laugh echoed off the ink-stained walls. <words>309</words> "But here's what you missed, clever minstrel." <words>316</words> Vex snapped his fingers, and the factory door swung open. <words>326</words> "I already gave it away—centuries ago, to the dragon whose scale you hold." <words>339</words> The steam vent's hiss became a roar. <words>346</words> "She's been sleeping beneath this factory, waiting for someone foolish enough to wake her with her own scale's destruction." <words>365</words>

Kalros lowered the slingshot slowly, his skepticism finally, beautifully vindicated. <words>375</words> "Then we both lose?" <words>379</words>

"Or both win," Vex grinned. <words>384</words> "Depends on how much you like dragons." <words>391</words>

The floor began to crack. <words>396</words> The minstrel and the no-longer-immortal trickster exchanged a look of perfect understanding. <words>408</words> Sometimes the best scheme is the one where everyone gets burned. <words>419</words> Together, they ran for the door, laughing like madmen as the factory collapsed behind them, the dragon's awakening roar mixing with the steam vent's final, triumphant hiss. <words>447</words>
