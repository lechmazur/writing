The chopstick wrapper floated between Marcus's fingers, rotating slowly as his telekinetic gift held it suspended in the dusty air of the abandoned carnival prize booth. <words>20</words> He wore his faded jeans and vintage band tee like armor against the weight of what he'd come here to discover. <words>39</words>

"Step right up," echoed a phantom barker's voice from the rusted speakers overhead, and suddenly Marcus wasn't standing in 2023 anymore. <words>60</words> The flashback struck with violent clarity: a medieval monastery where monks bound books of forbidden knowledge, their fingers bleeding from needle pricks as they stitched secrets into leather spines. <words>89</words> He watched through ancient eyes as they sealed away truths that could transform flesh to shadow, shadow to light. <words>108</words>

The vision shattered when wind rattled the booth's torn awning. <words>118</words> Marcus steadied himself against a shelf of decomposing stuffed animals, their button eyes witnessing his quest across the tapestry of lost legends. <words>140</words> Each carnival had existed simultaneously throughout history—Byzantine bazaars, Victorian exhibitions, Depression-era sideshows—all connected by the same wandering souls who understood that knowledge demanded sacrifice. <words>164</words>

"Three tries for a dollar," crackled another recording, and Marcus tumbled into 1897. <words>177</words> A gentleman in suspenders casually tossed rings at bottles while discussing alchemy with the booth operator, a woman whose fingers bent reality like Marcus bent spoons. <words>204</words> She'd hidden something here, something about transformation that transcended mere party tricks. <words>216</words>

The wrapper in Marcus's telekinetic grasp began to unfold itself, revealing Chinese characters that rearranged into Latin, then Sumerian, then something older. <words>238</words> His casual appearance belied the ancient hunger burning through his veins—the bookbinder's curse that drove him to collect and preserve dangerous truths. <words>261</words>

"Winner every time," sang a child's voice from the speakers, yanking him into prehistory where shamans danced around fires, teaching their apprentices to bind spirits into objects, to revive the dead through careful manipulation of memory and matter. <words>300</words>

Marcus understood now. <words>303</words> The wrapper wasn't trash but a page, torn from a book he'd bound in another life when he'd first discovered his powers weren't random but inherited. <words>330</words> Every bookbinder across time had added their knowledge to this cosmic library disguised as abandoned amusements. <words>346</words>

He pressed the wrapper against his forehead, accepting the price. <words>356</words> His memories began hemorrhaging backward—birthdays, first kisses, his mother's laugh—all sacrificed to revive the ultimate secret of transformation. <words>374</words> The booth dissolved around him as he became what he'd always been: a curator of impossibilities, forever young, forever searching, forever paying the toll that knowledge demands. <words>402</words>

The wrapper fell to the ground, blank once more, waiting for the next seeker brave enough to trade their humanity for truth. <words>425</words>
