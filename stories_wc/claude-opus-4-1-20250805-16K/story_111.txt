The alchemist Mordecai descended the hidden stairs beneath the fountain, his fingers trembling against the golden typewriter ribbon he'd wound around his wrist like a talisman. <words>20</words> Years ago, before the Guild cast him out for heretical theories, this ribbon had typed his greatest formula—one that could theoretically intuit the divine through ripples in water. <words>46</words>

The secret dog park sprawled beneath the plaza, a cavern where strays gathered and howled their prayers to forgotten gods. <words>66</words> During brewing—that sacred hour when his cauldron bubbled with possibility—Mordecai would come here to test his faith against the empirical. <words>87</words> Tonight, the full moon filtered through drainage grates above, casting prison-bar shadows across the underground pond at the park's heart. <words>107</words>

His dilemma had consumed him for decades: could faith be measured, quantified, proven? <words>120</words> The Guild called it blasphemy, but Mordecai knew better—he'd seen the patterns, the theoretically intuitive connections between belief and reality that manifested in water's movement. <words>145</words>

He knelt beside the pond, savoring the mineral smell of cave water mixed with the metallic tang from his brewing apparatus nearby. <words>168</words> The dogs watched silently, their eyes reflecting his desperation to wrestle a dream from oblivion—the dream of proving that faith itself obeyed natural laws. <words>193</words>

With exultant grief flooding his chest, he unwound the golden ribbon and tied it to a smooth stone. <words>211</words> This ribbon had typed every formula, every prayer, every desperate calculation of his life's work. <words>226</words> Now it would serve as the final variable in his greatest experiment. <words>238</words>

He cast the stone into the pond's center. <words>246</words>

The ripples spread outward in perfect circles, but as they moved, they formed patterns—mathematical spirals, geometric progressions that matched his theoretical predictions exactly. <words>269</words> The golden ribbon glowed beneath the water, its light revealing equations written in the very movement of the waves. <words>288</words> Each ring told a story: here was doubt, there was certainty, and in between, the precise measurement of faith's weight upon reality. <words>310</words>

The dogs began to howl—not in fear, but in recognition. <words>320</words> They saw what Mordecai saw: proof that belief could be charted through the patterns in the rings of a pond after a stone is thrown. <words>345</words> His tears fell into the water, creating new ripples that intersected with the golden light, multiplying the equations into infinite variations. <words>366</words>

He laughed through his sobbing, understanding at last that his exile had been necessary. <words>380</words> The Guild could never accept this truth—that faith wasn't separate from science but woven through it like golden thread through dark fabric. <words>403</words> Here, in this hidden sanctuary where abandoned creatures still believed in magic, Mordecai had finally proven that the divine was both measurable and mysteriously beyond measurement, existing in the space between one ripple and the next. <words>441</words>

The brewing would continue until dawn, but his life's work was complete. <words>453</words> He'd wrestled his dream from oblivion and found it had been waiting for him all along, written in water and light. <words>474</words>
