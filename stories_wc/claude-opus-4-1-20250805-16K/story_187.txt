The stoic wanderer pressed the weathered floorboard from an abandoned cabin against her chest, its mesmerizingly bland surface hiding centuries of archived spells beneath layers of ordinary pine. <words>26</words> She'd followed a trail of nightmares across three provinces to reach this witch's familiar training ground, each fevered vision pulling her closer to what the Council insisted didn't exist. <words>55</words> The necessary lies they told protected both the innocent and the guilty—but Mara collected truths like others collected coins. <words>74</words>

"You're late," growled the instructor, a scarred woman whose familiar, a one-eyed raven, tilted its head at Mara's arrival. <words>93</words> Around them, apprentices practiced binding rituals with mice and sparrows, their clumsy attempts filling the air with sparks and frustrated squeaks. <words>114</words> The instructor raised her hand to the blackboard where the final formula shimmered in chalk—the last lesson before graduation, the one that would impose a familiar's absolute loyalty. <words>142</words>

Mara stepped forward, her voice carrying brash tenderness like a mother scolding a beloved child. <words>157</words> "That formula kills them inside, you know." <words>164</words> She held up the floorboard, its surface suddenly alive with glowing runes. <words>176</words> "The old witches knew better—they asked, never commanded." <words>185</words>

The instructor's hand froze mid-wipe. <words>190</words> "The Council banned those methods." <words>195</words>

"The Council fears what equals might become," Mara replied, tracing a finger along the board's grain. <words>211</words> The nightmares she'd followed weren't warnings but memories—familiars crying out across decades, their spirits crushed by forced servitude. <words>229</words> She'd spent years documenting forgotten practices, archiving ritual variations that honored both witch and familiar as partners. <words>246</words>

The raven cawed once, sharp and clear. <words>253</words> Its master's eyes widened as it spoke—actually spoke—for the first time in twenty years. <words>268</words> "She speaks truth, Elsa." <words>272</words>

The apprentices gasped, their half-formed bonds trembling with possibility. <words>281</words> Mara approached the board with deliberate calm, her weathered fingers gentle as she modified the formula stroke by stroke. <words>300</words> "Your Council teaches dominance because they fear rebellion," she said, adding symbols that transformed commands into requests. <words>317</words> "But magic born of partnership burns twice as bright." <words>326</words>

The instructor's hand trembled as she lowered it, leaving the modified formula intact. <words>339</words> Her raven flew to Mara's shoulder, and together they watched as young witches began releasing their bindings, offering hands instead of chains to creatures that suddenly seemed less like property and more like friends. <words>372</words>

Mara tucked the floorboard away, another successful archive preserved not in wood but in living practice. <words>388</words> Tomorrow she'd wander to the next grounds, following new nightmares toward older truths, her mission both burden and blessing. <words>407</words> The instructor finally spoke, her voice cracking: "Stay." <words>415</words> But Mara was already walking away, leaving behind revolution disguised as a simple lesson correction. <words>430</words>
