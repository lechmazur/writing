The convicted dream thief sat cross-legged in the forgotten library inside a treehouse, her fingers trembling as she opened the flimsy photo album. <words>19</words> Each photograph showed a different version of herself—fragments she'd stolen from sleeping minds over decades, pieces of who she might have been. <words>40</words>

"Seventeen plus eight," she whispered, counting the images wrong again, her mathematical challenges worsening since the trial. <words>57</words> Twenty-three fragments, not twenty-five. <words>62</words> She'd been sentenced here after the last human was born, condemned to guard knowledge no one would ever seek. <words>80</words>

The treehouse creaked in windless air. <words>86</words> Outside, the world had grown silent—no births meant no new dreams to steal, no fresh identities to try on like masks. <words>107</words> She turned another page, finding a photograph of herself playing badminton, a memory pilfered from a banker's Tuesday afternoon nap. <words>127</words>

That shared love for badminton had been her downfall. <words>136</words> The prosecutor had played too, recognized the stolen technique in her serve—a dead woman's muscle memory that didn't belong. <words>155</words> The jury convicted her in minutes, though she'd tried to explain: she wasn't stealing dreams but searching for her original self, lost somewhere in the collection. <words>182</words>

"Four hundred days," she miscounted, though it had been four thousand. <words>193</words> The fragments in the album shifted when she wasn't looking, rearranging themselves like an unsolvable equation. <words>209</words> The laughing child became the weeping widow became the soldier with steady hands. <words>223</words>

She needed to coax thunder from empty skies—that was the condition of her release. <words>238</words> Make it rain in a world where weather had forgotten its purpose. <words>250</words> The last human, born sterile and eternal, had whispered this impossible task through the courthouse walls. <words>267</words>

Her quiet mania manifested in the margins of library books, where she scribbled calculations that never balanced. <words>284</words> Seven fragments plus twelve equals thursday. <words>290</words> Divide herself by zero, multiply by absence. <words>297</words> The math of identity had its own cruel logic. <words>306</words>

She discovered it by accident—a photo of herself serving a shuttlecock into storm clouds. <words>321</words> The dreamer had imagined winning the point would bring rain. <words>331</words> Standing suddenly, she climbed to the library's highest branch and found an old racquet wedged between encyclopedias. <words>348</words>

With mathematical precision she couldn't achieve with numbers, she calculated the angle. <words>360</words> Then she took the plunge, leaping from the treehouse with racquet raised, serving an invisible shuttlecock at the silent sky. <words>380</words>

The fragments in the album below rustled like applause. <words>389</words> For one impossible moment, all her stolen selves aligned—athlete, criminal, child, mathematician—unified in the arc of her fall. <words>407</words>

Thunder cracked across the empty heavens. <words>413</words>

She landed in rainfall, whole at last, her sentence served in the space between breathing and drowning. <words>430</words>
