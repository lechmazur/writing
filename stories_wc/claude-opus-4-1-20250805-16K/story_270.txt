The lighthouse's forgotten library had been Erasmus Crow's sanctuary for ninety-seven years, though he'd only aged seventeen. <words>17</words> He traced his fingers along the astronomical globe, its brass constellations worn smooth by centuries of other hands that had sought the same impossible truths. <words>42</words>

"Still trying to map eternity, old fool?" he whispered to himself, his voice carrying that peculiar blend of self-mockery and pride that only the humbly arrogant possess. <words>69</words> The globe spun slowly, each constellation a reminder of the spell that had trapped him here in 1927, borrowing time from a century that wasn't his. <words>95</words>

Outside, the ocean crashed against rocks with metronomic persistence, but inside, dust motes hung suspended like frozen stars. <words>113</words> This was shared isolation—him and the lighthouse, both keepers of light that no ships sought anymore, both relics pretending purpose. <words>134</words>

The astronomical globe suddenly pulsed with warmth beneath his palm. <words>144</words> Erasmus jerked back, cynical instincts flaring, but the brass sphere continued its glow, projecting phantom constellations across the curved walls. <words>164</words> Among the stars, a pattern emerged that he'd never seen before—not in any of his decades of study. <words>182</words>

"The ephemeral alignment," he breathed, recognizing the configuration from a water-damaged tome he'd dismissed as fantasy. <words>198</words> Every 97 years, certain stars created a window, a crack in time's facade where borrowed centuries could be reclaimed or released. <words>219</words>

He began the incantation, his conjurer's training flooding back despite decades of disuse. <words>232</words> The words echoed strangely in the circular room, bouncing off stone walls like voices calling across a canyon, each repetition slightly altered, slightly more ancient. <words>256</words> The echo built upon itself, creating harmonics that shouldn't exist, awakening something that had slumbered in the lighthouse's bones. <words>275</words>

The library shuddered, books tumbling from shelves as reality grew thin. <words>286</words> Through the widening gaps between moments, Erasmus glimpsed other versions of himself—some who had never found the lighthouse, some who had escaped after mere days, some who had grown old and bitter in different prisons. <words>321</words>

"Choose," the echoes commanded, no longer his voice but something vast and indifferent. <words>334</words>

He could harness this ephemeral moment, step through into any timeline, abandon this borrowed century for another. <words>351</words> But as the astronomical globe spun faster, showing him infinite skies and possibilities, Erasmus understood the cruel joke. <words>369</words> Every timeline led to isolation—different lighthouses, different prisons, but always alone with his cynical wisdom and humble arrogance. <words>387</words>

With trembling fingers, he stilled the globe. <words>394</words> The echoes faded, the library settled, and Erasmus Crow remained, choosing the isolation he knew over the infinite isolations he didn't. <words>415</words> Outside, the ocean resumed its ancient rhythm, and inside, a cynical conjurer smiled at his astronomical globe, having finally harnessed the only ephemeral thing that mattered—acceptance. <words>442</words>

The lighthouse beam swept across empty seas, and somewhere in its light, time continued its patient borrowing. <words>459</words>
