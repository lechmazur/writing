Marina floated among the orbital debris field, her exorcist's collar catching starlight as she assembled the final toy—a mechanical bird whose wings held pressed wildflowers from Earth. <words>25</words> The inheritance of lies her grandmother had left her wasn't money or property, but something far more dangerous: the truth that demons had followed humanity to the stars. <words>52</words> Nothing was ever usual in the salvage station where she worked, but today her stage fright gnawed deeper than the vacuum outside. <words>74</words> 

The toy assembly line continued its automated dance around her, producing playthings for colony children who'd never seen real flowers. <words>94</words> Marina's hands trembled as she tucked the pressed wildflowers—lavender, forget-me-nots, baby's breath—into the bird's transparent wings. <words>110</words> These weren't just toys; they were vessels, each one designed to trap the small possessions that hitchhiked on human grief. <words>130</words>

She heard it then: the sound of a key turning in a lock, though no physical door existed here. <words>149</words> The noise echoed through her skull, a sign that something was trying to manifest. <words>163</words> Her grandmother's journal had warned her: "They come through sorrow, feed on forgotten things." <words>177</words> The old woman had lied to everyone, claiming she was just a therapist, never revealing the exorcisms she performed in spacecraft graveyards. <words>200</words>

Marina forced herself to submerge her consciousness into the meditative state required for banishment, even as her performance anxiety screamed. <words>220</words> A hundred dead satellites watched like an audience as she began the ritual. <words>233</words> The entity emerged from a shattered solar panel, wearing her grandmother's face—a cruel mimicry. <words>247</words>

"You inherited nothing but fear," it whispered. <words>254</words>

Marina's voice cracked as she began the banishment prayer, but she continued, her defiance a whisper against the cosmic silence. <words>274</words> She pressed the mechanical bird to her chest, feeling the wildflowers' ancient power—Earth magic in the void. <words>291</words> "My grandmother lied to protect us," she said, steadier now. <words>301</words> "But I'll sculpt possibility from the ashes of 'never.'" <words>310</words>

The demon recoiled as Marina released the bird into the debris field. <words>322</words> Its wings opened, scattering preserved petals that glowed with terrestrial memory. <words>333</words> Each flower became a small sun, burning away the shadows between the wreckage. <words>346</words> The entity shrieked, dispersing into stardust. <words>351</words>

Marina's stage fright dissolved as she realized her true inheritance wasn't the burden of lies, but the courage hidden beneath them. <words>372</words> She continued assembling toys, each one a tiny guardian, while Earth hung blue and distant below. <words>388</words> In this graveyard of satellites, she was crafting hope from remnants, one pressed flower at a time. <words>405</words>
