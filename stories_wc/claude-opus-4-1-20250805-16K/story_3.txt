The surly watchman of Mariner's Rest graveyard worked his fingers through the short piece of yarn with serenely frantic precision, each knot marking another calculation. <words>24</words> Between autumn's death and winter's birth, when the veil thinned, old Grimsby practiced the rope-divination his grandmother had taught him beside her market stall forty years prior. <words>51</words> She'd whispered that market wisdom and cosmic patterns were identical twins – supply and demand governed stars as surely as fish prices. <words>73</words>

"Seven loops for seven tides," he muttered, twisting the yarn into configurations that mapped both constellations and cargo routes. <words>92</words> The dignified chaos of his movements resembled a conductor orchestrating a storm – purposeful yet wild, measured yet unbounded. <words>111</words> Each sailor's headstone around him bore merchant marks alongside death dates, their accumulated trading knowledge seeping into soil that somehow remembered. <words>133</words>

A visitor approached through morning fog, seeking the notorious watchman who solved problems through rope-riddles. <words>149</words> "My fleet vanishes at the same coordinate," the shipping magnate declared, desperate. <words>162</words> "Charts say deep water, but—"

"Charts lie; yarn doesn't," Grimsby interrupted, his calloused hands already working. <words>176</words> The yarn formed a pattern: three triangles intersecting a circle, the ancient symbol for market convergence his grandmother called "the hungry spiral." <words>199</words> He'd seen it before in star formations during equinoxes, in the way schools of fish circled before storms, in how prices crashed before wars nobody yet imagined. <words>227</words>

"Your riddle," Grimsby said, holding up the knotted yarn, "is this: what feeds on certainty and births doubt?" <words>246</words> The magnate stared blankly. <words>250</words> "Time," Grimsby answered himself. <words>254</words> "That coordinate marks where old charts measured before the sea floor shifted in the quake of seventy-three." <words>271</words> He pointed to a mass grave of merchants who'd trusted outdated maps. <words>284</words> "Market wisdom teaches: information expires like fish." <words>291</words>

The yarn unraveled as Grimsby pulled one strategic thread, the pattern collapsing into a simple line pointing northeast. <words>309</words> "Sail three degrees starboard from your coordinate." <words>317</words> He tucked the yarn into his pocket where it joined hundreds of similar pieces, each holding solved mysteries. <words>335</words> "Your ancestors' mistakes are the cosmos teaching through failure." <words>344</words>

As the magnate departed, Grimsby returned to his rounds among the graves, reading headstones like ticker symbols, understanding that the graveyard was just another marketplace where the dead traded stories for remembrance. <words>377</words> The cosmic patterns revealed themselves not in the stars above but in the convergence of human ambition and natural law, measured in yarn and years. <words>403</words> Between seasons, between worlds, he kept watch over both, a surly guardian of wisdom that most would call madness. <words>423</words> But Grimsby knew better – chaos and dignity were simply market forces in perfect, terrible balance. <words>439</words>
