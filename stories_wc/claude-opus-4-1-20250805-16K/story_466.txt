Margaret Blackwood pushed her cart through the produce aisle, her trained eye cataloging imperfections in the tomatoes while her mind wandered to the smoke signal tower visible through the store's high windows. <words>28</words> The abandoned structure had haunted her periphery for months, its weathered stone calling to something buried in her genealogy. <words>46</words> As she reached for organic lettuce, her fingers brushed against something papery wedged behind the price display—vintage seed packets, their faded illustrations depicting varieties extinct for decades. <words>73</words> 

The packets trembled in her hands, their cryptic Latin names and coded planting instructions triggering memories of her grandmother's stories about messages hidden in agricultural almanacs during the war. <words>102</words> Without hesitation, she pocketed them—theft, technically, though these weren't inventory but forgotten artifacts that predated the store itself. <words>120</words> Her pulse quickened with that familiar rush of acquisition, the same thrill that had built her underground reputation as the city's most resourceful procurer of the impossible. <words>147</words>

Abandoning her half-filled cart, Margaret drove straight to the university library where the old xerograph machine still functioned, its archaic technology perfect for revealing the invisible ink she suspected lay beneath the packets' printed surface. <words>183</words> Each copy emerged darker, stranger—not planting instructions but coordinates, chemical formulas, architectural sketches of the very smoke signal tower she'd been unconsciously orbiting. <words>206</words> 

The tower's door yielded to her lockpicks with disappointing ease. <words>216</words> Inside, narrow stairs spiraled toward a chamber where her grandmother's initials marked a loose stone. <words>231</words> Behind it: more seed packets, journals, and photographs of women who shared Margaret's sharp cheekbones and calculating eyes. <words>249</words> They were the Keepers, her grandmother's writing explained, protectors of heritage seeds and the genetic diversity that governments and corporations had tried to patent and control. <words>275</words>

The moral weight settled uncomfortably—these seeds could feed communities or fetch millions on black markets. <words>290</words> Margaret had always operated in grey zones, but this inheritance demanded choosing sides. <words>303</words> She climbed to the tower's peak where the signal mirrors remained intact, their surfaces still capable of sending coded messages across the valley. <words>327</words> 

Flash: her location to other Keepers. <words>333</words> Flash: the seeds were safe. <words>338</words> Flash: the bloodline continued. <words>342</words>

Below, the grocery store's parking lot sprawled like a concrete accusation of everything humanity had surrendered for convenience. <words>360</words> Margaret descended with pockets full of futures—heirloom tomatoes, forgotten grains, medicines disguised as flowers. <words>374</words> She would plant some, sell others, gift the rest to urban farmers who asked no questions. <words>391</words> Her destiny, elusive no longer, sprouted from the intersection of preservation and profit, heritage and hustle. <words>407</words> The smoke signal tower would be her greenhouse, her fortress, her gentle chaos blooming in ordered rows. <words>424</words> Some would call her savior, others thief, but Margaret preferred the truth: she was evolution's insurance policy, written in seeds. <words>444</words>
