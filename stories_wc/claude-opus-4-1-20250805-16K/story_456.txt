Mei arranged funeral wreaths by day, but tonight she stood in the floating rock dojo, her fingers trembling as the lantern's dying light painted shadows across stone walls. <words>27</words> She had climbed here through mist and starlight, carrying only a plain white candle and the weight of questions about death's place in the universe's eternal dance. <words>54</words> The dojo's master had died three moons ago, leaving behind a trunk of typed pages that chronicled his search for understanding cosmic cycles—birth, decay, rebirth—patterns Mei glimpsed daily in her morbid profession. <words>85</words>

She was neutrally passionate about death, neither celebrating nor mourning it, but accepting it as petals accept their fall. <words>104</words> Her beliefs had been tempered through years of creating beauty from grief, watching families pour love into arrangements that would wilt within days. <words>127</words> The master's writings spoke of this same paradox: how destruction feeds creation, how endings birth beginnings. <words>143</words>

"You came," a voice whispered. <words>148</words> 

Mei turned to find the master's apprentice, now guardian of this floating sanctuary. <words>161</words> "You asked me to oblige your request," she said, her voice boldly timid, pushing words through uncertainty. <words>178</words> "You said the master left something for the one who understands both bloom and decay." <words>193</words>

The apprentice gestured to the trunk. <words>199</words> "His final pages are sealed with wax—they require a new flame to open." <words>212</words> The lantern gave its last flicker, plunging them into darkness. <words>222</words> 

With practiced steadiness born from arranging flowers in dim funeral parlors, Mei lit her plain white candle. <words>239</words> Its fresh flame revealed the trunk's deepest compartment, where yellowed pages waited like pressed flowers in a forgotten book. <words>258</words> She broke the wax seal, and words spilled forth about the cosmic wheel, about how even floating dojos must eventually fall, how even stone returns to dust to feed new worlds. <words>289</words>

"He wrote these while dying," the apprentice murmured. <words>297</words> "He wanted someone who wouldn't fear his words, someone who saw death as he learned to—not an ending but a transformation." <words>318</words>

Mei read through the night, her candle burning steady as her tempered beliefs shifted and expanded like opening blossoms. <words>337</words> The pages revealed meditations on entropy and renewal, on how the universe breathes through cycles of creation and collapse. <words>356</words> Each typed word was a seed the master had planted, knowing he wouldn't see them bloom. <words>372</words>

As dawn approached, Mei understood why she'd been summoned. <words>381</words> She who arranged flowers for the dead could teach the living about life's circular nature. <words>396</words> The dojo needed someone who grasped both sides of existence's coin, someone boldly timid enough to share hard truths gently. <words>416</words> She closed the trunk, her fingers steady now, ready to carry the master's wisdom back to earth, one funeral bouquet at a time. <words>439</words>

The candle flame danced between them, neither dying nor truly living, perfectly balanced in its consuming glow. <words>456</words>
