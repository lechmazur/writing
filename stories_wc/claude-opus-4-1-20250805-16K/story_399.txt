The crypt caretaker Mordecai shuffled into the witch's crystal scrying room, his weathered hands clutching an unmarked cardboard tube that had arrived without explanation at midnight. <words>22</words>

Through the skylight above, stars wheeled in their ancient patterns while the witch Thessaly worked at her sand mandala, each grain placed with infinite precision. <words>47</words>

"You shouldn't be here," Mordecai growled, though his voice carried less venom than usual. <words>61</words>

"The dead sent you," Thessaly replied without looking up, her fingers drawing spirals that seemed to multiply singular moments into cascading eternities. <words>83</words>

The tube began to jiggle in his grip—a subtle vibration that matched the rhythm of his racing heartbeat. <words>101</words>

For forty years, Mordecai had tended the crypts below, keeping vigil over those who slept in stone embrace, but lately something stirred within him—memories that refused their burial. <words>129</words>

"Your trauma speaks through the patterns," Thessaly observed, watching as her mandala's design shifted to mirror the constellations overhead. <words>148</words>

The uprising within Mordecai's chest had begun three weeks ago when he'd discovered that unmarked tube wedged between two ancient sarcophagi. <words>169</words>

Each night since, phantom voices whispered through the corridors of his mind, demanding acknowledgment, demanding witness. <words>185</words>

"Open it," Thessaly commanded softly, and the grandiose subtlety of her tone made the simple words feel like prophecy. <words>204</words>

His fingers trembled as he uncapped the tube, revealing a scroll covered in names—hundreds of them—written in his own young hand from a war he'd tried to forget. <words>233</words>

The sand mandala began to glow, each grain catching starlight and reflecting it back sevenfold, creating a constellation map of his buried grief. <words>256</words>

"You were their medic," Thessaly said, her voice gentle now. <words>266</words>

"I was their failure," Mordecai whispered, watching as the names seemed to lift from the parchment, dancing in the scrying room's crystalline air. <words>289</words>

The witch's fingers moved through the sand, and suddenly Mordecai understood—his grumpiness had been armor, his isolation in the crypts a penance for those he couldn't save. <words>317</words>

"Trauma multiplies when singular souls try to carry collective grief alone," Thessaly explained, her mandala now showing not just stars but faces—young faces frozen in their final moments. <words>345</words>

The tube jiggled once more, then stilled, as if whatever spirit had animated it finally found peace. <words>362</words>

Throughout their stargazing vigil, Mordecai wept for the first time in decades, each tear absorbed by the sand mandala, transforming the pattern from one of sorrow to acceptance. <words>390</words>

By dawn, the uprising within him had quieted to a whisper, then to silence, then to something that might, given time, become peace. <words>414</words>

The crypt caretaker departed with the empty tube, understanding now that the dead he tended included parts of himself he'd buried long ago. <words>437</words>

Thessaly swept away her mandala with one graceful gesture, knowing that some patterns must be destroyed to truly heal. <words>456</words>
