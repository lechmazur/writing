The town-weary traveler pushed through the salt-rusted gate of the abandoned carnival house of mirrors, drawn by the rhythmic tapping of a metal sign swinging in the coastal wind. <words>28</words> Years of wandering had hammered him into this strange repose, this exhausted peace that came from having nowhere left to run except deeper into himself. <words>53</words> The mirrors, cracked and clouded, multiplied his haggard reflection into infinity, each one a prison cell of his own making. <words>73</words> He needed to escape the confines of his mind, to break free from the endless loop of thoughts that circled like vultures. <words>95</words>

Above him, inexplicably intact, hung a stained glass panel depicting two hands cupping flames. <words>109</words> The cradle of sparks, he thought, remembering his grandmother's words about where love begins—not in the heart, but in that space between intention and accident. <words>135</words> The metal sign outside continued its measured beat against the building's frame, and with each tap, colored light from the panel danced across the mirrors. <words>160</words> He reached up, meaning only to steady himself against a mirror, but his ring struck the glass at the exact moment the sign tapped again. <words>185</words>

The sound resonated through the space, an intentionally accidental harmony that seemed to fertilize something dormant in the air itself. <words>205</words> The mirrors began reflecting not his face, but memories—fragments of every person he'd loved and left behind in his restless journey. <words>227</words> Sarah's laugh in the bakery window. <words>233</words> Marcus teaching him to tie sailing knots. <words>240</words> His mother's hands braiding his sister's hair. <words>247</words> Each reflection sparked against the others, creating new patterns, new possibilities he'd never allowed himself to see. <words>264</words>

The tapping grew louder, or perhaps he was simply listening differently now, hearing it as a heartbeat rather than a countdown. <words>285</words> The stained glass panel cast its light like seeds across the broken mirrors, each fragment catching fire with color. <words>304</words> He understood then that his wandering had been its own kind of prison, that movement without connection was just another mirror reflecting nothing back. <words>328</words>

In this hammered repose, this place between exhaustion and revelation, he saw her face in every shard—the woman who'd waited in the last town, who'd asked him to stay. <words>358</words> The mirrors held that moment now, the hush before she'd almost said the words, before he'd turned away. <words>376</words> The sign tapped once more, a final beat, and he knew what he would do. <words>391</words> He would return, would stand in that same hush, and this time he would be the one to finally say, "I love you." <words>413</words> The sparks had been cradled long enough; it was time to let them catch fire. <words>428</words> He turned from the mirrors, leaving them to their endless reflections, and walked back into the world, fertilized with purpose. <words>448</words>
