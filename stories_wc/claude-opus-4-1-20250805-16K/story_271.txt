The morbid juggler known as Mortis stood among the dusty beakers of the abandoned laboratory, his painted skull face cracking into a grin as he tossed three preserved hearts in perfect arcs. <words>24</words> Each organ had been harvested from scientists who'd died here decades ago, victims of their own experiments in twisting traditions of death itself. <words>46</words> The bent ruler on the workbench caught his eye—warped by heat from an explosion that had ended the facility's official operations. <words>67</words> 

He'd come here following rumors of the Laughing Gas Project, where researchers had tried to weaponize joy, to make armies collapse in hysterics. <words>90</words> Consistently strange things happened in this place: shadows moved independently of their sources, equations wrote themselves on foggy glass, and the air tasted of copper pennies. <words>117</words> Mortis picked up the bent ruler, noting how it measured reality incorrectly now, showing seven inches where twelve should be. <words>137</words>

The scent of rare spices suddenly filled his nostrils—cardamom, black pepper, star anise—emanating from a broken containment unit marked "EMOTIONAL CATALYST." <words>159</words> The aroma triggered something deep in his performer's soul, memories of circus tents and children's laughter before the accident that had transformed him into this consistently strange creature who juggled death. <words>191</words> He felt compelled to clamp his fingers around the nearest intact vial, labeled "FINAL JEST," its contents swirling with opalescent promise. <words>212</words>

Years ago, traditional entertainers brought joy through simple tricks, but Mortis had learned to twist those traditions, making audiences confront mortality through his macabre performances. <words>237</words> The laboratory's experiments had attempted something similar—forcing happiness through chemistry rather than earning it through human connection. <words>255</words> Both approaches were wrong, he realized, feeling the weight of the vial. <words>268</words>

As he uncorked it, releasing more of those impossible spices, he understood the cosmic punchline: the scientists had succeeded, but not how they'd intended. <words>293</words> Their formula didn't create laughter—it revealed the absurdity already present in existence. <words>306</words> Within the span of a shared smile between himself and his reflection in the cracked mirror, Mortis felt the compound taking effect. <words>329</words> His painted face began to genuinely laugh, not at death or suffering, but at the beautiful futility of trying to control joy. <words>352</words>

He would laugh last at the cosmic punchline, not as victor but as someone who finally understood the joke. <words>372</words> With defiant compassion, he pocketed several vials to share with the terminally ill children at the hospital where he performed. <words>393</words> They deserved to glimpse the absurd beauty he'd found here, to laugh authentically at death's approach rather than fear it. <words>414</words> The morbid juggler left the laboratory, his bent ruler tucked under his arm, ready to measure a world that had never been straight to begin with. <words>441</words>
