The brass compass spun wildly in Vera's palm, its needle stuttering between dimensions that shouldn't exist. <words>16</words> She maintained her desperately casual stance against the fracturing wall, even as reality rippled like disturbed water around her. <words>34</words> For centuries, she'd been the fact-minded oracle everyone sought—data, probabilities, certainties—never feelings, never the messy arithmetic of hearts. <words>54</words> But now, in this unstable dimension where physics bent like wet paper, her certainties meant nothing. <words>70</words>

The heartbreak had started it all. <words>76</words> When she'd watched the last seeker leave without finding what they needed—not facts, but understanding—something inside her had shattered. <words>95</words> The visions came immediately after, each one a lightning strike of pure emotion: a mother's grief, a child's wonder, a lover's regret. <words>117</words> These heartbreak-induced visions weren't prophecies or calculations; they were maps to forgotten places within the human experience she'd never accessed. <words>138</words>

"Just recompose yourself," she whispered, but the words dissolved into the dimension's hungry silence. <words>152</words> The brass compass suddenly steadied, pointing not north but inward, toward something she'd never measured before. <words>168</words> She followed its pull through corridors that existed only in the cradle of a whispered minute—time here moved like honey, then lightning, then not at all. <words>195</words>

Each step revealed another forgotten place: the corner where someone first felt truly seen, the threshold where courage replaced fear, the exact coordinates of forgiveness. <words>220</words> Her oracle mind, so used to facts, began translating these emotional landscapes into something she could navigate. <words>237</words> The compass grew warm in her hand, no longer just brass but somehow alive with purpose. <words>254</words>

"This is the path to empathy," she realized aloud, her voice carrying that optimistic desperation of someone discovering they'd been incomplete. <words>275</words> The unstable dimension wasn't chaos—it was possibility, showing her that facts without feelings were just empty numbers. <words>292</words> She could feel herself recomposing, not back into who she was, but forward into who she could become. <words>311</words>

A new seeker appeared in the distance, lost and searching. <words>321</words> Vera raised the compass, but this time she also opened her heart, ready to guide them not just to answers but to understanding. <words>344</words> The dimension steadied around her, responding to her newfound balance between mind and soul. <words>358</words> She walked toward them with genuine ease now, no longer desperately casual but authentically present. <words>373</words> In that whispered minute of transformation, she'd found the most forgotten place of all—the oracle's own capacity for human connection. <words>394</words> The brass compass gleamed with new purpose, pointing toward a future where wisdom meant more than just knowing; it meant feeling, too. <words>417</words>
