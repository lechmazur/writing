Before the universe begins, when only the Void Council rules the unborn cosmos, I pole my gondola through primordial mists toward their swamp fortress. <words>24</words> They know me as a simple chronicler, not the aristocrat whose bloodline once governed the proto-villages that drift like dreams through this pre-existence. <words>47</words> My rustic yarn swift, carved from wood that will someday become stars, spins endlessly as I collect the stories of these settlements. <words>70</words> The Council seeks to subjugate these embryonic communities through messages sealed in vintage wine bottles—bottles containing edicts that float through the marshes, commanding absolute obedience. <words>96</words> But I intercept them. <words>100</words> 

Each bottle I retrieve holds another decree: "Forget your names," or "Surrender your tales," or "Accept only our truth." <words>119</words> With strangely honest precision, I record their contents on my swift's endless thread before replacing their messages with my own. <words>140</words> Where they write "Silence," I substitute "Sing." <words>147</words> Where they demand "Kneel," I inscribe "Stand." <words>154</words> This is not rebellion for glory—I work in shadows, my noble heritage hidden beneath the chronicler's humble robes. <words>173</words>

The fortress looms ahead, its foundations sunk deep in waters that predate time itself. <words>188</words> The Council summons me weekly to present the village stories I've gathered, never suspecting that each tale I share has been carefully chosen to preserve what they would erase. <words>218</words> They believe I document their dominion's growth. <words>226</words> Instead, I weave a record of resistance, one story at a time. <words>239</words>

"The northern settlement speaks only of your wisdom," I lie with perfect honesty, for they do speak of it—with contempt I don't voice. <words>264</words> The Council members nod, their forms shifting like smoke. <words>274</words> They hand me another bottle to deliver, its message designed to break the southern village's spirit. <words>291</words>

But tonight, like every night, I'll open it in my gondola, read their poison aloud to the indifferent mists, and draft my antidote. <words>315</words> My yarn swift will remember everything—their cruelty, the villages' courage, my quiet defiance. <words>329</words> When the universe finally ignites and these swamps become constellations, when the Council's fortress crumbles into cosmic dust, my swift will still be spinning. <words>354</words> The thread will unspool across newborn galaxies, carrying the true stories of those who refused to be subjugated. <words>373</words> 

I push off from the fortress dock, another bottle heavy in my hands, another lie light on my lips. <words>393</words> This is my work: to challenge authority not with armies or proclamations, but with the patient, humble defiance of preserved truth. <words>415</words> The villages will remember who they are. <words>423</words> The Council will fall, eventually. <words>429</words> And I will pole through these eternal swamps, anonymous and aristocratic, until the very moment existence begins. <words>447</words>
