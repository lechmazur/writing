Marcus had lifted wallets from marks in every corner of the city, but nothing prepared him for what he found in the haunted lighthouse engine room. <words>20</words> The ventriloquist dummy sat upright against rusted gears, its glass eyes following him with an intelligence that defied its wooden construction. <words>41</words>

"You're early," the dummy said, though its mouth never moved. <words>51</words>

Marcus froze, his practiced fingers suddenly useless. <words>58</words> Between his afternoon appointment with his fence and the evening heist he'd planned, he'd ducked into the abandoned lighthouse to count yesterday's take. <words>81</words> Now he stood face-to-face with something that challenged every natural law he'd taken for granted. <words>97</words>

"Don't look so baffled," the dummy continued, its voice echoing from the corroded pipes. <words>112</words> "I've been waiting for someone who understands transformation—real transformation, not the petty costume changes you call disguises." <words>129</words>

Marcus found his voice, sharp with defensive precision. <words>137</words> "I don't do costumes. <words>141</words> I become invisible, merge with crowds, transform into whatever people expect to see." <words>155</words>

The dummy's head tilted with a mechanical click. <words>163</words> "Then prove it. <words>166</words> Transform this moment into something that matters." <words>173</words>

Without thinking, Marcus began to speak in rhythm: "In spaces between the tick and tock, where shadows dance and spirits mock, I steal not gold but moments frozen, transform myself through paths unchosen." <words>206</words>

The engine room hummed with newfound energy. <words>213</words> The dummy's painted smile seemed to widen. <words>220</words> "Better. <words>221</words> But can you sustain it?" <words>226</words>

Marcus continued, his words flowing with confusingly lucid clarity, each verse revealing truths he'd never acknowledged: "My fingers quick, my conscience bound, I take from those who won't look down. <words>256</words> But here I stand in rust and steam, confronting what I've never been—a thief of possibility, locked in my own poverty." <words>277</words>

The impromptu poetry session stretched between them like a bridge. <words>287</words> Marcus realized the dummy wasn't speaking to him but through him, using his voice to articulate its own imprisonment. <words>306</words> They were both trapped—one in wood and paint, the other in patterns of survival that had calcified into identity. <words>325</words>

"The art of transformation," Marcus whispered, understanding flooding through him, "isn't about changing what others see. <words>341</words> It's about breaking the machinery that keeps us fixed in place." <words>353</words>

The dummy slumped forward, suddenly just wood and fabric again. <words>363</words> But Marcus felt different, electric with purpose. <words>370</words> He'd spent years picking pockets to survive, but survival had become its own prison. <words>385</words> Walking out of the engine room, leaving his tools behind, he spoke one final verse to the salt-stained air: "Between appointments with the past, I choose to transform at last." <words>415</words>

The lighthouse beam, dead for decades, flickered once—acknowledgment from whatever had spoken through painted lips, challenging him to sustain this new existence. <words>437</words>
