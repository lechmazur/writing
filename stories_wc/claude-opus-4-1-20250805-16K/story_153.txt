Marcus had studied immortality for twelve billion years, accumulating degrees from universities that no longer existed on planets consumed by their dying suns. <words>18</words> Now, in the underground city of New Molehattan, where the last remnants of consciousness persisted after the universe's final star had winked out, he continued his research with the same methodical patience. <words>50</words>

The mole people had evolved beyond their original forms, becoming beings of pure thought sustained by geothermal energy. <words>68</words> They regarded Marcus with polite indifference—another surface dweller clinging to obsolete flesh while pursuing an already achieved state. <words>86</words> Yet Marcus knew what they didn't: immortality without understanding was merely prolonged ignorance. <words>99</words>

His latest breakthrough came from an unlikely source—a coal miner's headlamp recovered from a collapsed mine on Old Earth, its bulb somehow still functional despite the entropy that had claimed galaxies. <words>131</words> The lamp had been a gifted burden, passed between miners for generations, each bearer adding their memories to its metal surface through quantum scarring. <words>156</words> Marcus discovered he could digitize these impressions, converting lived experience into pure information. <words>170</words>

The process required swapped travel journals between dimensions—his own detailed observations traded for those of parallel versions of himself who had chosen different paths. <words>194</words> Each exchange revealed another facet of existence, another way reality could be mastered through understanding rather than mere endurance. <words>213</words> The mole people's archives, carved into crystallized dark matter, became his library. <words>226</words>

Marcus worked with detached devotion, emotions filed away like completed coursework. <words>237</words> Love, fear, joy—all catalogued and cross-referenced but never truly felt, for feeling would compromise the objective study of being. <words>257</words> His existence had become mundanely glorious: the spectacular achievement of outliving the cosmos reduced to routine documentation and analysis. <words>277</words>

The headlamp illuminated his workspace, its light impossible in the dead universe yet undeniably present. <words>293</words> Each photon it produced violated thermodynamics, creating something from nothing—the very principle Marcus sought to understand. <words>310</words> The miners who had worn it hadn't sought immortality, yet their memories persisted more vibrantly than his endless education. <words>330</words>

As he digitized another journal entry, Marcus realized the truth: mastery of reality didn't come from studying it but from accepting its contradictions. <words>354</words> The mole people knew this, living impossibly in impossible darkness. <words>364</words> The lamp knew this, shining without fuel. <words>371</words> Even the swapped journals knew this, existing simultaneously in multiple states. <words>382</words>

Marcus touched the lamp's scarred surface, finally understanding that his eternal education was both gift and burden—keeping him alive to witness truth while preventing him from becoming it. <words>411</words> In the underground city's deepest chamber, surrounded by the dreams of extinct stars, he continued his studies, forever approaching but never reaching the mastery that required surrender rather than conquest. <words>443</words> The last student in a dead universe, learning lessons that no one remained to teach. <words>459</words>
