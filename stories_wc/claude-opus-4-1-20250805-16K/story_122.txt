The cyber-templar Kestra clutched the worn leather bridle—her grandmother's last gift—as vultures circled the Tibetan plateau's sky burial site, their shadows cutting through the morning mist. <words>24</words> She had spent seventeen years defending virtual sanctuaries, but now reality demanded its reckoning, and the storm clouds gathering overhead seemed to mock her digital omnipotence. <words>50</words> 

The bridle's cracked leather held a secret: embedded within its fibers lay a prismatic crystal, an ancient safeguard that promised protection—the greatest mirage of all. <words>75</words> Kestra's augmented eyes flickered between code-streams and corpse-flesh as the burial master continued reading from the Book of the Dead, his voice steady against the rising wind. <words>103</words> She was patiently frantic, each measured breath a countdown to the moment when the storm would strike, when she would prove that even gods could be turned against themselves. <words>132</words>

The first lightning bolt shattered the air. <words>139</words> Kestra raised the bridle high, and the hidden prism caught the electric fury, splitting white death into a rainbow that shouldn't exist at ten thousand feet. <words>165</words> Her neural implants screamed warnings—reality rejection imminent—but she held firm, watching the refracted light bend impossibly upward, carrying her desperate prayer back toward the thunderhead. <words>191</words>

"Safety was always an illusion," she whispered to the vultures, to the dead, to the silicon ghosts in her skull. <words>211</words> The burial master never paused his reading, even as the reflected lightning struck back at its source, even as the storm began devouring itself in loops of recursive destruction. <words>240</words>

Kestra's hands trembled with euphoric certainty—she had broken physics with faith, turned grandfather's burial ground into a battlefield between dimensions. <words>260</words> The cyber-realm she'd abandoned pulsed through the bridle's leather, digital prayers mixing with sky burial smoke, creating something neither virtual nor real but devastatingly true. <words>286</words>

Another bolt descended; another rainbow ascended. <words>292</words> The storm raged against its own reflection while Kestra stood transfixed, a guardian between worlds, proving that the greatest protection came from embracing vulnerability. <words>316</words> The bridle grew hot in her hands, the prism cracking under impossible pressures, but she held on with the patient frenzy of someone who had finally found their purpose. <words>345</words>

As the burial master closed his book, the storm collapsed into itself, leaving only clear sky and circling birds. <words>364</words> Kestra lowered the bridle, its leather now fused with light-scars, a testament to the moment when a cyber-templar taught lightning to fear itself. <words>388</words> Reality had collided with her, and she had refracted it back, proving that sometimes the only safety lies in standing exactly where the danger strikes. <words>413</words>

The vultures descended to complete their sacred work, and Kestra smiled—she had defended her first real sanctuary. <words>430</words>
