The conscientious objector had traded his rifle for binoculars, watching the hanging orchard from his perch above the storm-ravaged ravine. <words>17</words> Marcus volunteered for neighborhood watch duty during the autumn craft fairs, when tourists descended upon their isolated valley like migrating birds. <words>36</words> His clipboard held detailed maps of their routes—which stalls they visited, where they parked, how long they lingered at the cider stand. <words>59</words>

He was valiantly bored, maintaining his surveillance with military discipline despite the tedium of recording license plates and sketching movement patterns. <words>80</words> The rusty nail jutting from his observation post had become his timekeeper; he'd tap it rhythmically while counting heads. <words>99</words> Below, apple trees clung to the ravine's walls at impossible angles, their roots exposed by decades of storms that had carved the earth away. <words>123</words>

"More tea?" his grandmother called from behind, practicing the xenial hospitality their family had perfected over generations. <words>140</words> Every Thanksgiving, they opened their property for the final craft fair of the season, welcoming strangers with warm drinks and hidden agendas. <words>162</words> It was tradition—his great-grandfather had started it during the Depression, ostensibly to help traveling merchants but really to document who had valuables worth taking. <words>187</words>

Marcus accepted the steaming cup with a smile that never reached his eyes. <words>200</words> "Seven more vehicles from the coast today," he reported, showing her his meticulous notes. <words>214</words> "Same migration pattern as last year." <words>220</words>

She patted his shoulder approvingly. <words>225</words> "The neighborhood watch appreciates your dedication, especially after you refused deployment." <words>236</words> Her tone dripped honey over arsenic. <words>242</words> "Such conscience." <words>244</words>

He understood the game perfectly. <words>249</words> His objection to military service hadn't been about pacifism—it was about choosing his own battles. <words>264</words> Why fight strangers overseas when the real intelligence gathering happened here, tracking the seasonal movements of wealthy craftspeople who trusted too easily? <words>287</words>

Thunder rolled through the ravine as another storm approached. <words>296</words> Marcus watched a young couple examining handmade quilts, unaware their every gesture was being catalogued. <words>311</words> The woman wore an expensive watch; the man paid cash from a thick wallet. <words>325</words> He tapped the rusty nail three times—their signal—and his grandmother descended toward them with her tray of poisoned pleasantries. <words>344</words>

Throughout the craft fairs, the hanging orchard witnessed this dark choreography, its storm-bent branches framing a theater of predation disguised as protection. <words>366</words> Marcus continued his vigil, mapping human migrations with the patience of a spider documenting flies, his conscience clear because he'd never claimed to be good—only observant. <words>393</words> The neighborhood watch would receive his reports, never knowing they were really cataloguing prey. <words>407</words>
