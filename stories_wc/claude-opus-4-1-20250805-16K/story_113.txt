The hesitant bard clutched her worn-out dinosaur plush as she descended into the xenon-lit tunnel where the dream-hopping machines hummed their electric lullabies. <words>24</words> It was December thirty-first of the year everyone would rather forget, when the pandemic had stolen so many futures that time itself seemed to crack. <words>48</words> Mira's fingers trembled against the purple velvet of the stegosaurus she'd carried since childhood, its fabric thin as gossamer now, each thread marking another year survived. <words>74</words> The machines towered before her like chrome confessionals, their neural interfaces glowing with promises to let her slip between sleeping minds and plant seeds of hope. <words>100</words>

She was shyly loud, this contradiction of a performer who sang with thunderous passion in others' dreams but could barely whisper her coffee order in waking life. <words>127</words> The facility director had recruited her specifically for this trait, knowing that dream-space amplified timid souls into prophets while reducing bombastic ones to whispers. <words>151</words> "You'll motivate them," he'd said, "unravel the tapestry woven from this year's sorrow, thread by careful thread." <words>168</words>

Mira settled into the first machine's embrace, feeling the xenon lights pulse in rhythm with her heartbeat, casting everything in that peculiar blue-white that made moments feel eternal and instant simultaneously. <words>199</words> The dinosaur plush pressed against her chest as the electrodes found their homes on her temples. <words>215</words> She thought of extinction events, of creatures that once ruled the earth reduced to children's toys, and understood with ironic awe how time makes fossils of all our certainties. <words>244</words>

The machine activated, and suddenly she was everywhere and nowhere, sliding through the collective unconscious of a city desperate to forget. <words>265</words> In each dream, she appeared differently but always singing, her voice both whisper and roar, carrying melodies that reminded sleepers of what existed before grief rewrote their stories. <words>293</words> She found a child dreaming of empty playgrounds and sang him songs of swings that would move again. <words>311</words> She discovered an elderly woman reliving endless hospital corridors and hummed harmonies of grandchildren yet to be born. <words>328</words>

Hours passed like centuries, centuries like heartbeats, until Mira emerged from the final session as midnight approached. <words>345</words> The xenon tunnel seemed dimmer now, or perhaps her eyes had adjusted to brighter lights within sleeping minds. <words>363</words> Her dinosaur plush had absorbed tears she didn't remember shedding, its worn fabric somehow softer for the salt. <words>381</words> Outside, fireworks began their ascent, each explosion a small rebellion against the darkness. <words>394</words> The hesitant bard smiled, knowing that tomorrow's dreams would carry forward her quiet thunder, motivating a world to remember that even extinction is just another word for transformation. <words>422</words> Time was fragile, yes, but perhaps that's what made it precious enough to sing about. <words>438</words>
