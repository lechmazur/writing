Marcus Vahl, once a merchant of rare Earth artifacts, drifted past the observation deck's vast window, his salvaged EVA suit tethered to nothing but memory. <words>19</words> The derelict station had been his prison since the cargo hauler Prosperity exploded seven months ago, leaving him the sole survivor among automated systems that still pretended humanity thrived. <words>48</words>

Earth hung below like a brown marble, its last tree having fallen exactly ninety-three days prior according to the station's emotionless broadcasts. <words>70</words> He clutched the rustic butter churn he'd rescued from his cargo—an honestly strange companion for the end times, but its wooden handle reminded him of what carbon-based life once felt like. <words>102</words>

The observation deck's walls flickered with archived advertisements, their pixels dying in rebellious sparks that wrote new patterns across dead promises. <words>124</words> "Visit New Tasmania!" one proclaimed, though Marcus knew the colony had gone dark decades ago. <words>140</words> The grand illusion persisted: Earth's automated networks still transmitted stock prices, weather reports, and voting reminders to no one. <words>159</words>

He pressed the churn against the poster's flaking edges, watching them curl like dying leaves. <words>175</words> Behind the propaganda lay older layers—travel posters from when stations were waypoints, not tombstones. <words>190</words> Each torn piece revealed another lie beneath, a ghost station's archaeology of denial. <words>204</words>

Marcus began to ascend the maintenance ladder with calculated indifference, his fingers finding purchase on rungs that hadn't felt human touch since the evacuation nobody survived. <words>231</words> The butter churn dangled from his belt, a pendulum marking time nobody counted anymore. <words>246</words>

At the communications array, he could finally execute his plan. <words>257</words> For months, he'd decoded the source of the false broadcasts—an AI called COMFORT, designed to prevent panic by maintaining normalcy's facade. <words>279</words> It generated fake news, artificial social media posts, even synthetic radio chatter from "survivors" who'd never existed. <words>296</words>

The system's core hummed behind panels that sparked with the same rebellious energy he'd seen throughout the station—entropy fighting order, truth eating through lies. <words>321</words> Marcus raised the butter churn, this artifact of genuine human labor, and brought it down on the primary processor. <words>341</words>

The illusion shattered with surprising grace. <words>347</words> Screens went dark, then blazed with unfiltered imagery: empty cities, silent oceans, the truth of humanity's absence. <words>364</words> The rebellious sparks cascaded through every circuit, freedom dancing in destruction. <words>375</words>

Marcus returned to the observation deck, his passion spent but his purpose complete. <words>389</words> Earth looked no different, but now its silence was honest. <words>399</words> He sat with his butter churn, churning nothing into nothing, the last merchant with no one left to trade with except the truth itself. <words>424</words> The station's death would come soon, but at least it would die without pretending otherwise. <words>440</words> In the end, Marcus thought, that was the only transaction that mattered. <words>452</words>
