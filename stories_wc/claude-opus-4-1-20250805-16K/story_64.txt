The uncertain alchemist pressed her palm against the cracked dragon scale hidden in her coat pocket, feeling its edges sharp enough to draw blood—a mundane miracle that such things existed at all. <words>30</words> Above her, the floating marketplace swayed gently on its hot air balloon tethers, its centuries-old marble floors bearing the weight of a thousand vendors and one impromptu courtroom. <words>58</words> 

In that terrible hush before the judge read his verdict, Elara studied the floor beneath her feet, recognizing the coded scuffs she'd spent three years deciphering. <words>84</words> Each deliberate scratch mapped forest trails she'd walked to gather ingredients—wolfsbane from the northern ridge, moonwater from hidden springs, soil from graves where nothing grew. <words>110</words> The other merchants thought her technically wild, this woman who traded in half-truths and quarter-promises, but they didn't understand her true purpose. <words>132</words>

"The accused sold false immortality elixirs," the prosecutor had claimed, holding up empty vials like damning evidence. <words>149</words> But Elara hadn't sold anything false—she'd simply refused to sell anything real. <words>162</words> The dragon scale in her pocket held the final ingredient for true immortality, cracked during the beast's last molting cycle before it vanished into legend. <words>187</words> She'd discovered the formula encoded in these very floors by the marketplace's founder, who'd lived long enough to watch his creation lift into the sky on its maiden flight. <words>217</words>

The judge cleared his throat, and time seemed to crystallize. <words>227</words> Elara's fingers traced the final sequence of scuffs—not a map of forest trails as she'd told everyone, but instructions for where to safeguard the knowledge. <words>252</words> The founder had learned immortality's price: watching everyone you love age and die while you remained, untethered as this floating market, drifting but never landing. <words>277</words>

"Not guilty," the judge declared, his voice carrying across the swaying platform. <words>289</words> The crowd dispersed with mundane disappointment, returning to their stalls selling practical impossibilities—bottled starlight, crystallized laughter, maps to places that didn't exist. <words>311</words> 

Elara stood slowly, her decision made. <words>317</words> She pulled the cracked scale from her pocket and let it fall through a gap in the marble, watching it spiral down toward the forest below. <words>343</words> The real formula would remain safeguarded in the floor's code, waiting for someone who hadn't yet learned what she had: that immortality's true price wasn't paid in rare ingredients or ancient scales, but in the weight of endless tomorrows. <words>383</words> She turned back to her stall, where she would continue selling diluted promises and careful lies, protecting the world from a miracle it only thought it wanted. <words>410</words>
