The carnival's last tent collapsed as dawn painted the polluted swamp orchard gold, where Brother Marcus discovered he'd accidentally become mayor. <words>19</words> Three nights ago, in a crowded café, he'd overheard two councilmen plotting to abandon the dying town—their voices carrying over espresso steam and morning chatter. <words>44</words> "Let the monks inherit this cesspool," one had laughed, not knowing Marcus sat behind them, clutching his clockwork beetle—the monastery's most sacred relic. <words>68</words>

Now, through a bureaucratic loophole they'd exploited to flee, the lovably grumpy monk found himself legally responsible for three thousand desperate souls. <words>90</words> The beetle clicked and whirred in his weathered palm, its brass wings catching light as carnival workers loaded their trucks. <words>110</words> This ancient automaton, crafted by the order's founder, was said to hold water wisdom—the knowledge of purification that could heal any corrupted land. <words>134</words>

"You staying or going, Mayor?" asked a carny, hefting a painted mermaid sign. <words>147</words>

Marcus scowled, though his eyes betrayed fondness. <words>154</words> "Apparently, I have no choice." <words>159</words>

The swamp orchard stretched behind him—gnarled apple trees drowning in industrial runoff, tended by his twelve remaining brothers who believed suffering brought enlightenment. <words>182</words> But Marcus had heard those councilmen mention something else: the chemical company's expansion plans, the final poisoning that would kill everything. <words>203</words>

He pressed the beetle's thorax. <words>208</words> It began to metamorphose, unfolding into an intricate map of underground waterways, showing pristine aquifers beneath the contamination. <words>226</words> The water wisdom wasn't mystical—it was geological truth encoded in gears and springs by monks who'd studied this land for centuries. <words>247</words>

"Brothers!" Marcus called, his gruff voice carrying across the toxic bog. <words>258</words> "Bring shovels!" <words>260</words>

They emerged from morning prayers, blinking in surprise at their accidental mayor giving orders. <words>274</words> The carnival workers paused their exodus, watching this strange theater unfold. <words>285</words>

"We're changing fate today," Marcus announced, holding the transformed beetle high. <words>296</words> "Not through prayer, but through wells." <words>302</words>

A reluctant awe settled over the gathered crowd as they understood: the cranky monk would save them through ancient knowledge and modern action. <words>325</words> The beetle's bronze surface reflected the sunrise, showing well-points that could tap clean water, bypass the poisoned surface, irrigate new orchards. <words>346</words>

One by one, the carnival workers set down their loads. <words>356</words> The strongman grabbed a shovel. <words>361</words> The fortune teller rolled up her sleeves. <words>368</words> Even the monks, bewildered by their brother's transformation from hermit to leader, joined the dig. <words>383</words>

By noon, clear water gurgled up through the first well, and Marcus allowed himself a small, grumpy smile. <words>401</words> Sometimes fate changed not through grand gestures, but through overheard conversations, inherited responsibilities, and the wisdom to know that even polluted ground could bloom again. <words>426</words>
