The chandelier's crystals trembled as Marcus entered the Blackwood estate's dining room, three leashes wrapped around his wrist like prayer beads. <words>17</words> Outside, color bled from day into night, painting the gothic windows in shades of dying amber. <words>33</words> The mastiffs he walked for the ultra-rich Blackwood family sat perfectly still, their breathing the only sound breaking the loud silence that pressed against the walls. <words>60</words>

Along the mahogany table, Mrs. Blackwood's prized botanical collection lay arranged—pressed flowers from graveyards across Europe, each labeled with dates of deaths, not blooms. <words>84</words> Marcus had discovered them months ago, their toxic beauty revealing the silent agreements between the living and dead in this house. <words>105</words> He'd learned to be carefully careless here, touching nothing directly, speaking only when spoken to, pretending not to notice the servants who cast no shadows. <words>131</words>

"You came," whispered a voice from the head of the table. <words>142</words> Mrs. Blackwood materialized, her pale fingers tracing the edge of a black hellebore. <words>156</words> "I wondered if you would honor our arrangement after what happened at the blood drive." <words>172</words>

Marcus felt his throat constrict. <words>177</words> Three weeks ago, at the charity blood drive she'd hosted, he'd seen her reflection missing from the mirrors, watched her avoid the crosses worn by donors. <words>204</words> When their eyes met across the medical equipment, she'd known he understood. <words>217</words> Yet he'd returned the next day to walk her dogs, and every day since. <words>232</words>

"The dogs need walking," he said simply, trying to justify his presence to himself as much as to her. <words>251</words> "Whatever else exists here, they're innocent." <words>258</words>

She smiled, revealing nothing and everything. <words>264</words> "Courage is standing where fear dares not tread, Marcus." <words>274</words> Her fingers selected a dried wolfsbane, its purple faded to grey. <words>286</words> "My late husband collected these specimens, believing they could ward off what I am." <words>301</words> The mastiffs whined softly. <words>305</words> "He was wrong, of course." <words>311</words>

The room's temperature dropped. <words>315</words> Frost spiraled across the windows as servants began setting the table with empty plates, their movements mechanical, eyes vacant. <words>334</words> Marcus understood then—his carefully careless observations, his continued service despite the truth, had sealed an unspoken pact. <words>351</words>

"Will you stay for dinner?" she asked, though no food appeared. <words>363</words> "The dogs prefer when you're here." <words>370</words> Her voice carried centuries of loneliness. <words>376</words> "As do I." <words>380</words>

Marcus looked at the mastiffs, their eyes reflecting candlelight like small moons. <words>392</words> In this haunted mansion dining room, where botanical death decorated the table and silent agreements governed survival, he made his choice. <words>413</words> "I'll stay," he answered, his carefully careless facade finally, frighteningly honest. <words>424</words> The loud silence that followed spoke volumes about the price of standing where others feared to tread. <words>441</words>
