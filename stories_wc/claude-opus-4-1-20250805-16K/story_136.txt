In the depths of Earth's first root system mapping facility, before humans carved symbols into stone, Senna worked as a quiet matchmaker—not of lovers, but of mycorrhizal networks and tree roots. <words>31</words> Her fingers traced invisible conversations across monitoring screens, silently talkative in the language of chemical signals that plants had taught her through centuries of rebirth. <words>56</words> Each death, each return to flesh brought clearer understanding of the patterns she desperately needed to decode. <words>73</words> 

The mariner's log book sat heavy in her lap, its pages filled with observations from her previous life sailing the primordial seas, recording the first coral spawnings. <words>100</words> Those ocean rhythms, she now understood, mirrored the pulsing communications beneath the forest floor. <words>114</words> The painful joy of remembering overwhelmed her—how many times had she died to gather this knowledge? <words>131</words> How many bodies had she inhabited, always returning to this same soul-deep mission? <words>144</words>

The facility's outdated VR headset hung from copper wires she'd rewired herself, transforming it into a translation device. <words>162</words> Through it, she could experience the root networks' electrical impulses as three-dimensional maps of connection and exchange. <words>179</words> Each pulse revealed how fungi matched trees in elaborate partnerships, sharing nutrients like lovers sharing secrets. <words>195</words> But tonight, she would push further. <words>201</words>

Adjusting the headset's frequency, Senna began to jeopardize everything the facility had built. <words>214</words> The safe parameters they'd established meant nothing compared to what she might discover. <words>227</words> As electricity surged through rewired circuits, the underground network suddenly blazed into her consciousness—not just local roots, but the entire planetary web. <words>249</words> 

The log book's final entry had hinted at this: "The sea remembers what the land forgets." <words>266</words> Now she understood. <words>269</words> The ocean's currents and the forest's root systems were one continuous conversation, a single organism's circulation system that had existed since life began. <words>293</words> 

Pain shot through her skull as the headset overloaded, but joy flooded her heart. <words>308</words> She'd found it—the pattern that governed rebirth itself, written in the matching of roots to fungi, currents to continents. <words>328</words> Her quiet work of pairing had revealed the greatest marriage of all: consciousness wedding itself to matter, again and again, in endless cycles. <words>352</words>

As her body convulsed, Senna smiled. <words>358</words> Death was coming, but she'd decoded enough. <words>365</words> The next matchmaker would find her notes, her rewired headset, the mariner's log annotated with root system maps. <words>383</words> They would continue where she left off, another silent voice in humanity's longest conversation. <words>397</words> The painful joy of discovery would pass between lives like nutrients between trees, forever cycling, forever reborn. <words>414</words>
