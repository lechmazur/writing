Mackenzie Starr hadn't been famous since her sitcom cancellation seventeen years ago, but she still walked with the authentically odd gait of someone who'd learned to dodge paparazzi before learning cursive. <words>26</words> The crumpled treasure map she'd found in her dead manager's safety deposit box led her here—to a vibration analysis chamber beneath the old MGM studios, where sound engineers once tested cathedral windows for the perfect resonance. <words>62</words> 

She pressed her palm against the stained glass, feeling the hum that had driven three sound technicians to madness in 1947. <words>83</words> The price of ambition, she thought, remembering how her manager had promised to make her a star again if she just trusted him one more time. <words>109</words> Now, after the last secret is revealed—that he'd been using child stars' residual checks to fund his search for what he called "the frequency of fame"—she finally understood. <words>138</words>

The map's instructions were simple: wait for the seventh harmonic to trickle through the hidden layers of etched glass in the cathedral window. <words>161</words> She'd thought it was metaphorical bullshit until she saw the actual cathedral window, stolen from Notre-Dame during renovations, installed in this soundproof tomb. <words>185</words> 

The chamber's monitors flickered to life, displaying wavelengths that shouldn't exist. <words>196</words> Mackenzie laughed—a broken, beautiful sound that made the glass sing. <words>206</words> Her whole life had been about chasing something that glittered just out of reach: first fame, then normalcy, then fame again. <words>227</words> But standing here, watching reality bend through hundred-year-old glass, she felt something crack inside her chest. <words>243</words>

"You magnificent bastard," she whispered to her dead manager's memory. <words>253</words> He'd been right about one thing: to tap into the wild magic of madness, you had to let go of everything that made sense. <words>277</words> The window began to weep—actual tears of light trickling down its surface, pooling on the concrete floor in puddles of pure possibility. <words>299</words>

She stepped forward, her sneakers splashing through liquid stardom. <words>308</words> The vibrations entered her bones, rewriting her DNA with the same frequency that had made Garland tragic and Monroe luminous. <words>328</words> This was what her manager had died trying to find—not fame, but the terrible engine that created it. <words>346</words>

The glass shattered inward, each shard floating like a promise. <words>356</words> Mackenzie opened her mouth to scream or sing—she wasn't sure which—and swallowed the glittering fragments of every dream she'd ever had. <words>377</words> The chamber recorded her transformation, machines documenting the exact frequency at which ambition becomes divinity. <words>391</words>

She emerged three hours later, her eyes reflecting colors that didn't have names. <words>404</words> The security cameras would show nothing. <words>410</words> The world would call it a comeback. <words>417</words> But Mackenzie knew better—she'd paid the ultimate price of ambition: becoming exactly what she'd always feared she was meant to be. <words>438</words>
