The Countess Magdalena Voss stood before the rusted gates of Wonderland Heights, her grandmother's botanical illustration clutched against her threadbare coat. <words>18</words> The abandoned amusement park had consumed three generations of her family's fortune, each heir believing they could resurrect its glory, each failing spectacularly. <words>39</words> Now, with her estate seized by creditors, Magdalena had decided to walk the seventeen miles here instead of driving—her last car had been repossessed anyway. <words>65</words>

The roller coaster loomed against the twilight sky, its wooden skeleton groaning with memories that seemed to exist between parallel paths of reality. <words>88</words> Sometimes she glimpsed it pristine and gleaming; other times, decay consumed everything. <words>100</words> Both versions felt equally true. <words>105</words>

Her grandmother's illustration depicted Heliotropium vossianum—a flower that supposedly grew only here, its petals containing the secret recipes that had made Wonderland Heights' confections legendary. <words>130</words> The treats had been realistically odd: cotton candy that whispered fortunes, caramel apples that showed glimpses of other lives, funnel cakes that made people briefly harmonize with the universe's frequency. <words>159</words>

Magdalena climbed into the first car, its safety bar dropping with supernatural precision. <words>173</words> The coaster lurched forward without power, ascending the first hill as her grandmother's voice echoed from nowhere and everywhere. <words>192</words> "The burden isn't the park, darling. <words>198</words> It's believing we must save what wants to die." <words>207</words>

At the peak, reality blurred into vivid impossibility. <words>215</words> She saw her ancestors, each clutching their own botanical illustrations, each seeking the same mystical flower. <words>231</words> They'd all ridden this same ghostly circuit, between what was and what could never be. <words>247</words>

The car plummeted, and Magdalena understood with crystalline clarity: the flower had never been real. <words>262</words> The secret recipes were simply her family's obsessive need to reclaim something that had only existed in their desperate imagination. <words>282</words> The coaster's loops and curves weren't taking her through space but through time's possibilities, showing her how each generation had failed to harmonize with the simple truth. <words>309</words>

As the ride slowed, she found herself holding not her grandmother's illustration but a blank page. <words>325</words> The paper seemed to pulse with potential, waiting. <words>333</words> She could draw a new flower, invent new recipes, perpetuate the cycle. <words>345</words> Or she could step off this ride forever. <words>353</words>

The safety bar lifted. <words>357</words> Magdalena left the illustration on the seat and walked back through the gates, her footsteps finally harmonizing with her own path rather than her legacy's ghostly rhythm. <words>384</words> Behind her, the roller coaster continued its endless circuit, carrying nothing but the weight of what the Voss family could never release. <words>406</words> The burden wasn't inheriting ruin; it was believing ruin was all they deserved. <words>419</words>
