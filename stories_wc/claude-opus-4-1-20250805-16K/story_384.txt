Marco's hands trembled as he ladled soup in the earthquake prediction facility's cafeteria, his mind elsewhere entirely. <words>16</words> The frantic cook had discovered something impossibly conceivable while cleaning the basement archives three floors below. <words>31</words> Through centuries of layered dust, he'd found a wooden walking stick propped against forgotten filing cabinets. <words>47</words> Small notches carved along its length weren't decorative—they were a code. <words>58</words>

For weeks, Marco analyzed those marks during his breaks, rubbing a worn pencil eraser against paper as he transcribed patterns. <words>78</words> The eraser, down to its last millimeter, had helped him reveal what graphite impressions remained on forgotten letters stored beside the stick. <words>100</words> These documents, dating to 1847, contained correspondence between the facility's founder and a mysterious correspondent who signed only with symbols. <words>120</words>

The notches matched those symbols perfectly. <words>126</words>

What Marco uncovered would subvert everything the facility claimed about predicting earthquakes. <words>138</words> The letters revealed that seismic predictions weren't based on tectonic data at all. <words>151</words> Instead, the facility had been following a predetermined schedule written centuries ago, carved into that walking stick by someone who somehow knew—had always known—when the earth would shake. <words>180</words>

His breath came in rapid bursts, yet his movements remained methodically calm as he served lunch to unsuspecting seismologists. <words>199</words> This frenzied tranquility had become his constant state since the discovery. <words>210</words> How could he expose the root of all illusions—that their scientific institution was built on ancient prophecy rather than empirical observation? <words>231</words>

The worn eraser had revealed more forgotten letters, each one describing future quakes with uncanny precision. <words>247</words> Dates, magnitudes, epicenters—all encoded in those walking stick notches made by someone who'd died before seismographs existed. <words>264</words> The impossibly conceivable truth was that every "prediction" the facility had made came from decoding this wooden oracle. <words>282</words>

Marco's supervisor called from across the cafeteria, asking about tomorrow's menu. <words>293</words> He responded automatically while his mind raced through implications. <words>302</words> The facility's computers, sensors, and algorithms were elaborate theater. <words>311</words> Scientists unknowingly validated predetermined outcomes, their research retroactively justifying what had already been written in wood and ink. <words>329</words>

Tonight, after his shift, Marco would return to the basement. <words>339</words> The final notch remained undecoded, and the corresponding letter's date was tomorrow. <words>351</words> His hands steadied as he understood his purpose—not just to expose the illusion, but to prevent whatever that last prophecy foretold. <words>372</words> The walking stick held one more secret, and Marco, a simple cook amid brilliant scientists, was the only one who could read it. <words>395</words>

The earthquake was coming, and this time, someone finally knew the truth about knowing. <words>409</words>
