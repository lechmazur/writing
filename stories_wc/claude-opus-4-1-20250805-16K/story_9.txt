The soothsayer's fingers trembled as she traced the water rings on the battered wooden bar top, each circle magnifying futures that were probably unlikely but desperately needed. <words>24</words> Between lost years—that liminal space where time forgot to keep score—she'd set up shop in this maze of billboards, their neon prophecies selling everything except hope in a desert that had once been Kansas farmland. <words>60</words>

"Environmental stewardship," she muttered with molten sarcasm, reading the faded slogan on a half-buried sign through the bar's cracked window. <words>81</words> "Sure, because nothing says 'saving the planet' like a thousand electric monuments to consumption where wheat used to grow." <words>100</words>

Her pocket puzzle box clicked—one lock, then another. <words>109</words> Thirteen locks total, each one opening only when she correctly predicted another ecological tipping point. <words>124</words> She was mildly panicked now, having just opened the eleventh. <words>135</words> The water rings showed her what the others couldn't see: aquifers collapsing like dominoes, each drought magnifying into the next. <words>155</words>

A customer stumbled in—another climate refugee pretending to be a tourist. <words>166</words> "Tell my fortune," he slurred, slapping down water credits. <words>175</words>

She didn't need the rings for this one. <words>183</words> "You'll die thirsty, like everyone else who thought the future was someone else's problem." <words>198</words>

"That's cheerful." <words>200</words>

"You want cheerful? Wrong soothsayer, wrong century." <words>207</words> She returned to the rings, magnifying their patterns until she could see it—the moment when humanity would either evolve or evaporate. <words>229</words> The twelfth lock clicked open. <words>234</words>

Outside, the billboards flickered their lies: "Desert Paradise Estates," "Water Is Infinite," "Trust Tomorrow." <words>248</words> Each sign cast shadows that twisted into prophecies only she could read. <words>260</words> She'd come here to shape destiny with bare hands, but destiny was slippery as mercury and twice as toxic. <words>279</words>

The final ring on the bar top was still wet, still forming. <words>291</words> She pressed her palm against it, feeling the future branch and split. <words>303</words> In one timeline, the desert reclaimed everything, patient and absolute. <words>313</words> In another, probably unlikely but worth fighting for, people remembered what stewardship meant before it was just another word on a rusted sign. <words>337</words>

The thirteenth lock whispered, almost ready. <words>343</words> She knew what would open it: not predicting the apocalypse, but preventing it. <words>356</words> Her mild panic crystallized into something sharper—determination edged with desperation. <words>366</words>

"Hey," she called to the customer. <words>372</words> "Want to actually change your fortune?" <words>378</words>

He turned, confused. <words>381</words>

She held up the nearly-opened puzzle box. <words>388</words> "Help me tear down these billboards. Plant something real. Shape destiny with bare hands instead of waiting for it to strangle us." <words>410</words>

The water rings shimmered, showing a future that shifted, just slightly, toward possible. <words>423</words>

The thirteenth lock clicked. <words>427</words>
