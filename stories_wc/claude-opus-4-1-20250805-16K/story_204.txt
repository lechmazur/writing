Mira clutched the phantom train ticket punch, its brass surface green with decay, as she navigated the farmer's market crowds. <words>20</words> Years as a professional cuddler had taught her the unspoken rules of human touch, but metal—especially anything that once served the old transit systems—made her skin crawl. <words>48</words> 

The collision was gentle, almost choreographed. <words>54</words> An elderly woman with silver eyes apologized, then paused, recognizing the punch in Mira's trembling hand. <words>70</words> "You're speaking at the ceremony," she said, not a question but recognition of something unusually usual in their world where former technophobes gave acceptance speeches. <words>95</words>

"My grandmother's," Mira explained, though the woman hadn't asked. <words>104</words> "She was the last conductor before the spaceports replaced everything." <words>114</words>

The woman smiled, understanding bleeding through her expression. <words>122</words> "Mine was an engineer. Built the very hangar where you'll speak tonight." <words>134</words> She touched Mira's elbow—brief, professional, the kind of contact that acknowledged boundaries while offering comfort. <words>149</words> "The prejudice dies hard, doesn't it? Even when we know better." <words>160</words>

Three hours later, Mira stood in the abandoned spaceport hangar, its cathedral ceiling studded with stars through gaps where panels had surrendered to time. <words>184</words> The restoration committee had assembled here, hundreds of faces waiting in that peculiar hush before an acceptance speech begins, when possibility hangs thick as incense. <words>209</words>

She'd built her career on embracing human warmth while rejecting the cold machinery that had stolen her grandmother's purpose, watching the woman decay alongside her obsolete profession. <words>236</words> But standing here, holding the punch that had once validated countless journeys, Mira understood what the woman at the market had known instantly. <words>260</words>

The hangar breathed with ancient novelty—old bones wearing new purpose. <words>270</words> Just as her grandmother had punched tickets to destinations, Mira validated human connections in an age of digital isolation. <words>289</words> The tools changed; the need remained constant. <words>296</words>

"I accept this position," she began, her voice carrying across the vast space, "not despite my history, but because of it." <words>317</words> The punch caught moonlight through the broken roof. <words>325</words> "We who remember the world before must help build the world after." <words>337</words>

Her fingers found their usual grace, the same she used when holding a client through grief or loneliness. <words>355</words> The committee would restore this hangar not for spacecraft, but for gatherings—markets, ceremonies, celebrations. <words>369</words> Places where the unusually usual business of being human could unfold. <words>380</words>

The phantom punch would hang in the entrance, she decided, speaking the unspoken rule she'd finally learned: everything we fear losing has already transformed into something else, waiting for us to recognize its new face. <words>415</words>

The applause began slowly, like rain finding rhythm. <words>423</words> Mira closed her eyes, feeling her grandmother's approval in the metal's weight, warm at last against her palm. <words>441</words>
