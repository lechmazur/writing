The sneering envoy arrived at the domed vineyard on Kepler-442b's barren plain, where crystalline vines grew without soil, drinking radiation instead of water. <words>24</words> His name was Castellan, and he wore his contempt like ceremonial robes, believing himself above the agricultural mystics who tended this impossible garden. <words>46</words> The vineyard's dome stretched across three kilometers of rust-colored wasteland, its interior thick with neglected greenhouse chambers where experimental hybrids had been abandoned to evolve untended. <words>72</words> 

In his pocket, Castellan carried a folded note—the latest in a series of paper trails that had led him across seventeen systems. <words>95</words> Each document bore the same cryptic promise: instructions for cupping starlight in mortal palms, for holding infinity without burning. <words>114</words> The Agricultural Covenant had dismissed such notions as fantasy, but here, where physics bent to accommodate alien botany, possibility itself seemed newly born. <words>138</words>

He entered the central greenhouse, where centuries of neglect had created a furiously tranquil chaos—vines strangling their creators' equipment while maintaining perfect geometric spirals, leaves swirling in perpetual cyclones that somehow never touched the ground. <words>175</words> The air hummed with potential energy, each molecule vibrating across the hush of transformation. <words>190</words> Castellan began to sift through the swirling leaves, his fingers parsing botanical detritus like a scholar reading ancient texts. <words>209</words>

The paper trails hadn't lied—each previous note had contained coordinates hidden in agricultural reports, star charts disguised as harvest schedules. <words>229</words> Now, in this forgotten greenhouse, he discovered what the mystics had been cultivating: not mere plants, but living stellar collectors. <words>250</words> The vines' crystalline structure captured and condensed actual starlight, storing fusion energy in organic matrices that pulsed like hearts. <words>269</words>

His sneer faltered as understanding dawned. <words>275</words> The Agricultural Covenant hadn't dismissed this discovery; they had hidden it, creating elaborate paper trails to lead only the persistent here. <words>297</words> Castellan reached toward a glowing vine pod, watching his shadow fracture into probability clouds. <words>312</words> Time seemed to ramble here, destiny taking scenic routes through quantum gardens. <words>325</words>

When he finally grasped the pod, its surface warm as summer earth, he felt the weight of compressed starlight—actual stellar mass contained in biological architecture. <words>351</words> The folded note in his pocket began to glow, its ink rearranging into new instructions: not for harvesting, but for becoming. <words>373</words> The mystics hadn't been growing crops; they had been cultivating the next evolution of humanity, beings who could hold stars without burning, traverse space as light itself. <words>402</words>

Castellan stood in the swirling greenhouse, no longer sneering but trembling, as his fingers began to shimmer with borrowed radiance. <words>422</words> His rambling journey had led him here, to this moment where destiny offered him infinity, one careful handful at a time. <words>443</words> The dome above him seemed suddenly transparent, and every star in the alien sky bent close, eager to be held. <words>464</words>
