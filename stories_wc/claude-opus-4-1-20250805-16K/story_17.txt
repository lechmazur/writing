Marcus pushed through the heavy oak door of the witch's incantation chamber, clutching the chipped bowl that held his morning tea—an atypically typical ritual for someone in his profession. <words>24</words> The black market genealogist had traced forbidden bloodlines for years, selling ancestral secrets to the highest bidder, but guilt gnawed at him like rust on iron. <words>50</words>

"You come amid morning walks again," the witch observed, her voice carrying brazen modesty as she sorted through yellowed papers. <words>70</words> "Still seeking what you already know exists?"

Marcus set down his chipped bowl, the ceramic's imperfection matching his fractured conscience. <words>87</words> "I need to find a path to self-forgiveness," he admitted, watching steam rise from the tea like departing souls. <words>106</words> "The families I've exposed, the legacies I've shattered—they haunt me."

The witch's eyes gleamed as she produced a stack of funeral programs. <words>129</words> "Then we analyze the subtext in funeral eulogies," she declared, spreading them across her altar. <words>144</words> "The dead speak truths the living dare not whisper."

Marcus leaned forward, his trained eye beginning to zoom through the carefully chosen words of remembrance. <words>165</words> Between "beloved father" and "community pillar," he detected patterns—admissions disguised as praise, confessions wrapped in grief's vocabulary. <words>182</words> Each eulogy revealed how the deceased had wrestled with their own transgressions, how they'd stood on the brink of renewal countless times. <words>204</words>

"See this one?" The witch tapped a passage about a banker who'd "always found creative solutions." <words>221</words> "He embezzled for twenty years, then spent his last decade secretly repaying every cent through anonymous donations." <words>239</words>

Marcus's fingers trembled as he traced another eulogy. <words>247</words> A teacher who'd "never gave up on anyone" had once falsified records to save immigrant children from deportation. <words>265</words> Crime and redemption, woven together like DNA strands he'd so often unraveled for profit. <words>280</words>

"Your guilt makes you atypically typical," the witch said, stirring something pungent in her cauldron. <words>295</words> "Every soul who enters here believes their sins are unique, yet all seek the same absolution." <words>312</words>

As morning light filtered through the stained glass, Marcus understood. <words>322</words> The eulogies weren't just stories—they were maps. <words>329</words> Each person had transformed their guilt into purpose, their shame into service. <words>341</words> His genealogical skills could expose truth not for destruction, but for healing—helping families reconcile with hidden histories, understanding rather than exploiting their roots. <words>365</words>

He lifted the chipped bowl, seeing his reflection in the remaining tea. <words>377</words> Imperfect, fractured, but still functional. <words>382</words> Still capable of holding something warm. <words>388</words>

"The brink of renewal isn't a destination," Marcus said quietly. <words>398</words> "It's where I choose to live now." <words>405</words>

The witch smiled, her brazen modesty softening into genuine approval. <words>415</words> "Then your morning walks have finally led you home." <words>425</words>
