The old-fashioned mage shuffled through the arctic research greenhouse, his woolen robes catching on tomato vines that shouldn't exist this far north. <words>20</words> His movements appeared purposefully aimless, a wandering that concealed desperate calculation as he traced patterns only he could perceive. <words>38</words> Children's laughter echoed from the adjoining lab during their designated playground time, but here among the impossible gardens, sanctified dread settled like frost. <words>61</words>

In his trembling palm lay a fragment of a pharaoh's coffin, its hieroglyphs pulsing with warmth that defied the polar cold pressing against the glass walls. <words>87</words> The unfolding riddle had begun three moons ago when the greenhouse mirrors started showing reflections that weren't quite right. <words>106</words> Each ephemeral encounter revealed another piece: a shadow moving independently, a face aging backwards, a glimpse of sand where snow should be. <words>129</words>

The mage pressed his forehead against the nearest mirror, watching his reflection splinter into a thousand versions of himself. <words>148</words> In one shard, he saw himself as a young apprentice; in another, a skeleton wearing his same robes. <words>166</words> The fragment grew hot, and suddenly he understood—the greenhouse wasn't just cultivating plants in impossible conditions. <words>183</words> It was cultivating possibilities, growing futures from seeds of the past. <words>194</words>

A child wandered in, lost from playground time, her eyes wide with that particular terror children feel when sensing something fundamentally wrong. <words>216</words> The mage knelt, opening his arms, and she ran to him, needing to cuddle against something solid and real. <words>235</words> As she pressed against his robes, the coffin fragment touched her hair, and the mirrors suddenly showed ten thousand greenhouses stretching across ten thousand frozen worlds. <words>261</words>

"What do you see?" he whispered. <words>267</words>

"Gardens," she breathed, "everywhere gardens." <words>272</words>

The riddle was unfolding faster now—each reflection showed another iteration of humanity's attempt to claim this uncharted frontier of impossibility. <words>292</words> The pharaoh's fragment wasn't just ancient wood; it was compressed time, smuggled north by researchers who thought they were merely studying climate adaptation. <words>316</words> Instead, they had created a nexus where past and future collided in chlorophyll and ice. <words>331</words>

The mage stood, still holding the child, feeling the weight of understanding. <words>343</words> The greenhouse was growing more than food—it was growing humanity's next evolutionary leap, feeding on the paradox of life thriving where it shouldn't. <words>367</words> The mirrors shimmered, showing countless versions of them standing there, each in a slightly different world, all converging on this moment. <words>388</words>

He set the child down gently, watching her run back toward the laughter. <words>401</words> The fragment crumbled to dust in his hand, its purpose fulfilled, the riddle complete. <words>415</words> The greenhouse would continue its sacred work, transforming the frozen frontier into something unprecedented, something terrifyingly alive. <words>432</words>
