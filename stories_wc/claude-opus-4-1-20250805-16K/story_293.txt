The nervous minstrel's fingers trembled against the lute strings as bioluminescent bacteria pulsed through the city's veins, casting greenish light across the tavern walls. <words>20</words> He clutched the crumpled photograph in his pocket—a relic from before the world changed, before cities learned to breathe and glow with bacterial life. <words>42</words>

"Another song about heroes and dragons?" slurred a patron, his drink fizzing with engineered microbes that would cleanse his liver by morning. <words>64</words>

The minstrel smiled, rarely sincere in his performances but tonight felt different. <words>76</words> The lonely candle flame on his table guttered, fighting against the humid air thick with spores that powered the district's neural network. <words>99</words> Time was running out—when the candle died, the old contract would expire, and he'd be bound to this bacteria-powered city forever. <words>121</words>

He'd spent years escaping the ordinary, fleeing from town to town, never staying long enough for his lies to catch up. <words>143</words> But here, where buildings grew from cultivated colonies and streets healed themselves overnight, his fabricated ballads felt especially hollow. <words>162</words>

The photograph showed a woman pointing at the night sky, her face blurred but her gesture clear. <words>179</words> His grandmother, before the Great Cultivation, when humans still navigated by following star patterns instead of the phosphorescent trails left by atmospheric bacteria. <words>203</words>

"I'll deploy one final song," he announced, his voice carrying a cautious revelry that made the tavern quiet. <words>221</words> His fingers found true notes for once, weaving a melody about finding purpose in a world of uncertainty, about those who chose symbiosis over dominion. <words>247</words>

As he sang, he remembered his grandmother's lessons about constellation navigation, how she'd insisted the old ways mattered even as cities sprouted bacterial nervous systems. <words>272</words> The song shifted, became something real—a map hidden in metre and rhyme, directions encoded in each verse's cadence. <words>290</words>

The patrons swayed, intoxicated by more than their drinks, not knowing they were learning an escape route through music. <words>309</words> By following star patterns obscured for decades by the city's bioluminescent dome, one could still find the settlements where humans lived unaugmented, ordinary and free. <words>336</words>

The candle flame danced lower, and the minstrel's rarely sincere smile became genuine. <words>349</words> He'd found his purpose at last—not as an entertainer but as a guide, deploying ancient knowledge through song before the bacterial city's consciousness fully awakened. <words>375</words>

When the flame finally guttered out, the minstrel was already walking toward the city's edge, his lute on his back and the crumpled photograph smoothed against his chest. <words>404</words> Behind him, a dozen patrons hummed his melody, their feet unconsciously tracing the first steps of a stellar path toward something beautifully, impossibly ordinary. <words>429</words>

Above the city's glow, stars waited patiently to guide them home. <words>440</words>
