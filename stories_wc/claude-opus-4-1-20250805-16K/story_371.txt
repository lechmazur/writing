The storm's last rumble died against the neon-soaked towers as Raze adjusted his grandfather's vintage hatpin—the only valuable thing he still owned—through the moth-eaten lapel of his coat. <words>28</words> His fashionably unfashionable ensemble of pre-war leather and salvaged chrome buckles marked him as neither street rat nor corpo, but something more dangerous: a broke swashbuckler who'd chosen poverty over complicity. <words>58</words> The night market sprawled before him, holographic vendors hawking synthetic dreams while real humans sold real desperation beneath flickering LED canopies. <words>79</words>

He didn't care, or rather, he cared too much to show it anymore—that fervent apathy that kept him moving when the world burned everyone who stopped to feel. <words>108</words> The hatpin began to emit a subtle vibration against his chest, its antique circuitry responding to the electromagnetic signature he'd been tracking for three weeks. <words>133</words> A child, augmented against her will, hiding somewhere in this maze of commerce and cruelty. <words>148</words>

The signal led him to a capsule hotel's maintenance level, where she'd made a nest beneath a rusted bed frame. <words>169</words> Antique marbles—real glass, not polymer—lay scattered across the floor in deliberate patterns. <words>181</words> Raze knelt, charting their swirl with practiced eyes, recognizing the old Traveler's Code his grandmother had taught him before the corporations sanitized history. <words>205</words> "Safe here," the marbles spelled. <words>210</words> "Trust nobody." <words>212</words>

"Smart kid," he whispered to the shadows, placing his own marble—cobalt blue, his calling card—at the pattern's edge. <words>230</words> The bed creaked, and wide augmented eyes peered out, scanning him with military-grade precision that no nine-year-old should possess. <words>250</words>

"You're him," she said. <words>254</words> "The one who helps without payment." <words>260</words>

He shrugged, the gesture deliberately careless though his heart hammered with purpose. <words>272</words> "Payment's overrated. <words>274</words> Besides, I'm broke." <words>277</words> He unpinned the hatpin, its nano-filaments still humming with her frequency, and set it on the floor between them. <words>296</words> "This can mask your signature for seventy-two hours. <words>304</words> Long enough to reach the underground railroad." <words>311</words>

"Why?" <words>312</words> Her voice carried the weight of someone who'd learned that kindness always had a price. <words>328</words>

Raze stood, his coat swirling like the cape of some ancient hero, though he felt nothing like one. <words>346</words> "Because in a world on fire, someone has to shelter what kindness remains, even if they have to pretend not to give a damn while doing it." <words>373</words> He turned to leave, then paused. <words>379</words> "The marbles were clever. <words>383</words> Keep using them." <words>386</words>

Walking back through the night market's chaos, penniless but oddly wealthy, Raze embodied the contradiction of his existence: a swashbuckler who fought not with swords but with small mercies, overcoming adversity one rescued soul at a time, caring desperately while perfecting the art of appearing not to care at all. <words>436</words>

The city's neon bled across puddles from the departed storm, and somewhere behind him, a child clutched an antique hatpin that would buy her freedom. <words>461</words> Tomorrow he'd be hungrier, broker, but tonight—tonight he'd won against the machine. <words>474</words>
