The wandering orchardist pressed her weathered palm against the barnacle-crusted door of what had once been City Hall, now drowned beneath forty fathoms of brine. <words>19</words> Her collection of dried leaves, sealed in wax and strapped to her diving suit, contained specimens from every orchard that had existed before the Great Submersion—apple, pear, cherry, plum. <words>48</words> Each leaf held the memory of trade routes that had connected this sunken metropolis to distant agricultural valleys, routes she needed to map again for the survivors above. <words>76</words>

Martha had earned her reputation as trustworthy unique among the surface settlements; she was the only diver who could navigate by reading the phantom impressions left in drowned buildings. <words>105</words> In this multiverse of infinite possibilities, where timelines folded and overlapped like wet paper, she'd learned that certain objects retained echoes across dimensions. <words>129</words> The dried leaves weren't just botanical samples—they were keys to understanding which trade partnerships had thrived in the parallel worlds where this city never sank. <words>155</words>

Inside the flooded council chamber, she found what she'd come for: the old oak kitchen table where councilors had once shared coffee and hard truths before formal meetings began. <words>185</words> Kitchen table wisdom, her grandmother had called it—the honest talk that happened when people stopped posturing and started solving problems. <words>206</words> Martha removed her glove and placed her bare hand on the waterlogged wood. <words>219</words>

The phantom hand touched hers immediately, cold even through the surrounding water. <words>231</words> Not a ghost, but a quantum echo—the mayor from a timeline where she'd chosen to stay and drown with her city rather than evacuate. <words>255</words> Through that spectral touch, Martha could reclaim the knowledge: trade agreements with the mountain orchards, shipping schedules, the names of trusted merchants who'd dealt fairly even when supplies ran short. <words>286</words>

Images flooded her mind—wagons loaded with preserve jars, children eating fresh apples at harvest festivals, the careful negotiations that had kept five counties fed through three separate droughts. <words>315</words> The phantom mayor's memories revealed which routes had survived longest across the multiverse's variations, which partnerships had endured even as cities rose and fell. <words>339</words>

Martha traced the routes onto her waterproof map with cramped, careful strokes. <words>351</words> Each dried leaf in her collection now had its corresponding trade line, its web of connections that could be rebuilt above the waves. <words>375</words> The work was lonely, diving through drowned histories to reclaim what was lost, but necessary. <words>391</words> When she surfaced, the settlements would have their roadmap—not just for survival, but for the kind of thriving that came from knowing which hands to shake, which promises to keep, which orchards to replant first. <words>427</words> The phantom hand released hers with what felt like gratitude. <words>438</words> Martha sealed her map and began her slow ascent, carrying the bittersweet weight of dead worlds' wisdom back to the living. <words>459</words>
