The minstrel's broken watch band dangled from her wrist like a question mark against time itself. <words>15</words> Above the endless city, the black velvet sky-lounge rotated slowly, its floor-to-ceiling windows framing a metropolis that stretched beyond every horizon. <words>37</words>

She'd been hired to perform, but now sat dismayed among scattered Polaroids instead. <words>51</words> Each photograph showed a different garden—rooftop sanctuaries hidden throughout the infinite urban sprawl below. <words>66</words> The images held secrets: shadows that shouldn't exist at certain hours, flowers blooming in impossible colors. <words>82</words>

"You're excavating memories," the lounge owner observed, his voice carrying laconic exuberance as he poured synthetic starlight into her glass. <words>102</words>

She nodded, studying how each garden's boundaries appeared differently depending on when the photo was taken. <words>119</words> The broken watch band had stopped mattering hours ago—or was it days? <words>132</words> Time moved strangely here, suspended between the city's electric pulse and the velvet darkness above. <words>148</words>

Her fingers traced the edges of one particular Polaroid. <words>157</words> A garden where night-blooming cereus covered wrought-iron gates, their petals opening only in darkness. <words>172</words> Another showed morning glories climbing walls that cast no shadows at noon. <words>185</words> Each image revealed how the city's gardens defied conventional boundaries between day and night. <words>200</words>

"I need to map this," she said, her musician's mind finding patterns in the chaos. <words>216</words> "An endless night exists here, hidden in plain sight among these gardens." <words>229</words>

The owner smiled. <words>232</words> "Subjectively rational, some would say—believing night persists simply because we choose not to see the sun." <words>249</words>

But she knew better. <words>253</words> The Polaroids proved it: timestamps that made no sense, shadows pointing toward light sources that shouldn't exist. <words>270</words> She began arranging them on the lounge's obsidian floor, creating constellations of secret gardens. <words>285</words>

Her broken watch band caught on a photo's edge, tearing it slightly. <words>298</words> Through the tear, she glimpsed something extraordinary—the same garden photographed from inside and outside simultaneously. <words>314</words> The boundaries weren't just drawn; they were permeable, shifting based on the observer's intent. <words>329</words>

She excavated meaning from each image, her dismay transforming into purpose. <words>341</words> The map wouldn't chart physical space but temporal boundaries, showing where eternal night pooled in the endless city's forgotten corners. <words>362</words>

Standing, she reached for her lute with newfound certainty. <words>371</words> The melody she played drew listeners from their conversations, its notes mapping the darkness she'd discovered. <words>388</words> The black velvet sky-lounge became her stage for revealing how night persisted in spaces between spaces, in gardens that bloomed beyond time's reach. <words>413</words>

The broken watch band finally fell away completely, unnecessary now. <words>423</words> She'd found her map in the intersection of music and memory, Polaroids and perception. <words>438</words> The endless night wasn't lost—it was waiting, hidden in gardens throughout the infinite city below. <words>454</words>
