Sheriff Wade pressed his weathered thumb against the tattered playing card—the Queen of Hearts, edges soft as moth wings from decades in his pocket. <words>18</words> The meditation room's lava lamps cast molten shadows across his badge, which he'd worn for thirty years without once feeling free. <words>38</words>

The road trips had started innocently enough. <words>45</words> Every weekend, he'd drive further from his jurisdiction, seeking something nameless in the steadily chaotic unraveling of his ordered life. <words>65</words> Gas stations became sanctuaries. <words>69</words> Rest stops, confessionals. <words>72</words> The highways whispered promises that duty never could. <words>80</words>

Today's drive had brought him here, to this unlikely refuge tucked behind a community garden where tomatoes grew wild against chain-link fences. <words>103</words> He'd stopped to buy vegetables from a roadside stand when someone jostled him—a young woman with dirt-caked fingernails and eyes like broken glass. <words>128</words>

"Sorry," she'd mumbled, then froze. <words>133</words> "You're him. <words>135</words> The sheriff from Millbrook." <words>139</words>

Wade's hand instinctively found the card. <words>145</words> His wife had held this same Queen the night she died, playing solitaire while waiting for him to come home from another late shift. <words>169</words> He never did make it in time. <words>177</words>

"I'm nobody," he said quietly. <words>182</words>

The woman studied him with an intensity that made his uniform feel like a costume. <words>198</words> "There's a place," she said. <words>203</words> "Through the garden. <words>206</words> For people who need to sit with themselves." <words>214</words>

Now, in the meditation room's amber glow, Wade understood why she'd brought him here. <words>228</words> The lava lamps moved like thoughts—slow, inexorable, reshaping constantly without violence or sound. <words>241</words> Other travelers sat in corners, each wrestling with their own invisible chains. <words>253</words>

He thought about his badge, his gun, the weight of protecting a town that had become his prison. <words>271</words> The Queen watched him from between his fingers, her painted smile faded but somehow more honest for it. <words>289</words> Through the window, he could see his patrol car parked beside the garden, looking suddenly temporary, like something he'd borrowed from another life. <words>313</words>

The woman appeared in the doorway, holding two cups of tea that smelled like earth and rain. <words>330</words> "Freedom isn't about running," she said, setting one beside him. <words>340</words> "It's about choosing to stay still when everything inside you is screaming to move." <words>354</words>

Wade set the card on the floor between them, its worn face catching the lamps' hypnotic light. <words>371</words> For the first time in thirty years, he removed his badge, placing it gently beside the Queen. <words>389</words> The metal made no sound against the meditation mat. <words>398</words>

Outside, the garden grew wild and purposeful, teaching him that true freedom meant learning when to let go and when to root deep. <words>422</words> His next road trip would be different. <words>429</words> He would drive home, turn in his resignation, and finally plant that garden his wife had always dreamed about. <words>448</words>

The Queen of Hearts smiled up at him, no longer tattered but transformed—a relic become talisman, a burden become blessing. <words>468</words> In the intensely quiet space between heartbeats, Sheriff Wade discovered that breaking free meant not escaping, but arriving. <words>485</words>
