The summoner slouched against the dream recording console, her apathy so perfected it had become an art form. <words>17</words> After the last breath of the dying god rippled through reality three days ago, the shared dream recording studio had emptied of all its usual technicians. <words>42</words> Only Mira remained, enthusiastically lazy in her dedication to doing nothing with great fervor, grinding coffee beans in the rustic hand-grinder she'd salvaged from the studio's break room. <words>71</words>

Each turn of the grinder's handle was a meditation on minimal effort maximized. <words>84</words> The coral reefs had died with the god—their polyps bleached white in both the waking world and the dreamscape. <words>103</words> Everyone else rushed about trying to resurrect divinity, but Mira understood what they didn't: river wisdom never fights the current. <words>123</words>

She summoned nothing, which was precisely the point. <words>131</words> In the deserted hall beyond the studio, twelve matching empty frames hung on the walls where dream-captures once shimmered. <words>150</words> The frames had contained the god's dreams of reef-building, each one a blueprint of calcium and color, symbiosis and salt. <words>170</words> Now they waited, hollow as promises. <words>176</words>

Mira poured the freshly ground coffee into the studio's neural interface, an unconventional choice that would have horrified the technicians. <words>196</words> The bitter aroma began to unfold through the frames like reverse smoke, each empty rectangle filling with the ghost of possibility. <words>217</words> This was her summoning: not calling forth, but allowing emergence. <words>227</words>

The coffee grounds carried earth-memory, rain-knowledge, the patient understanding of seeds. <words>237</words> They knew about waiting, about transformation, about the slow alchemy of becoming something else entirely. <words>252</words> The frames began to record not dreams but the spaces between dreams, the pause between divine breaths where creation actually lived. <words>273</words>

"You can't rebuild coral by forcing it," she murmured to the emptiness, her voice carrying the gentle sharpness of someone who'd learned to cut through illusion with kindness. <words>301</words> "You have to become the condition for its choosing." <words>310</words>

The studio's equipment hummed differently now, recording absence rather than presence. <words>321</words> Through the frames, something began to precipitate—not the god's vision of reefs, but the reefs' own dreams of becoming. <words>339</words> Tiny polyps of possibility, attracted to the coffee-dark warmth of patient indifference. <words>351</words>

Mira smiled, grinding more beans with the satisfied exhaustion of someone who'd discovered the secret: sometimes the laziest path requires the most profound effort. <words>375</words> The river wisdom flowed backward through the frames, teaching the coral to dream themselves into existence again. <words>392</words> After all, gods breathe out, but the world breathes in. <words>402</words> She just had to make space for the inhale. <words>411</words>
