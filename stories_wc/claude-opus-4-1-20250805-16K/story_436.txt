The sorrowful apothecary pressed her plastic spoon against the roughly refined crystal powder, watching it bifurcate into two uneven streams across the ancient mortar. <words>19</words> She worked alone in the exiled fortress floating above scorching deserts, its shadow dancing across endless dunes like a promise never kept. <words>40</words>

For three generations, her family recipes had sustained the oracle who once prophesied from this aerial prison. <words>58</words> But the oracle had fallen silent seventeen years ago, the very day the apothecary's daughter had plummeted from the fortress edge. <words>79</words> Now, in the final minute before the fortress library shut its doors for evening prayer, she discovered what she'd searched for across thousands of texts. <words>105</words>

Dream catchers. <words>107</words>

The oracle had been weaving them obsessively before her silence, leaving them scattered throughout the fortress like breadcrumbs of madness. <words>127</words> Each web contained a pattern—not random, but encoded. <words>136</words> The apothecary had spent months decoding dream catchers left behind, finding fragments of an ancient recipe her grandmother had whispered about only once. <words>159</words> "The Tongue of Stars," she'd called it, a tincture that could tempt an oracle to speak again, even against divine will. <words>180</words>

The plastic spoon—her daughter's favorite, kept from Earth before the exile—trembled in her weathered hands. <words>195</words> Such a simple thing, yet it connected her to both loss and hope. <words>208</words> The roughly refined ingredients responded to its synthetic touch differently than to metal or wood, creating reactions her ancestors couldn't have imagined. <words>231</words>

She understood now why the oracle had stopped speaking. <words>240</words> The woman had foreseen the child's death but chosen silence over prophecy, sparing a mother from anticipatory grief. <words>258</words> The dream catchers weren't madness but penance, each strand encoding an apology, each bead marking a future she refused to voice. <words>279</words>

As the library bell tolled its closing warning, the apothecary added the final ingredient—tears preserved in amber, harvested from joy rather than sorrow. <words>303</words> The mixture shimmered, then settled into something beautiful and terrible. <words>313</words>

She climbed the spiral stairs to the oracle's chamber, where the woman sat motionless among a thousand dream catchers, eyes vacant as the desert sky. <words>338</words> The apothecary held out the tincture, her voice breaking. <words>348</words> "I forgive you for your silence." <words>354</words>

The oracle's fingers closed around the vial, and for the first time in seventeen years, she wept. <words>371</words> "Your daughter," she whispered, voice cracking like dried earth finding rain, "she lives." <words>384</words>

The apothecary's knees buckled—painful joy flooding through her like lightning through sand. <words>396</words> Below them, the desert began to bloom. <words>403</words>
