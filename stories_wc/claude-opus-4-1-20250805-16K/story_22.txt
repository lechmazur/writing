Margaret, the small-town librarian, stood at the canyon's edge, fingering the stolen museum artifact tag she'd kept for forty years. <words>18</words> "Property of the Smithsonian," it read, though the artifact itself—a perfectly flawed obsidian mirror—had never belonged to any museum. <words>36</words> She'd fabricated the tag herself, a prop in her grand performance of harvesting grace from those foolish enough to believe her tales. <words>59</words>

The portal-strewn canyon below writhed with ancient carvings that shifted like living things whenever someone looked away. <words>76</words> Margaret had discovered it decades ago while following her grandmother's recipes for pickled starfruit, a dish only twelve families in the world still prepared. <words>100</words> Each family, she learned, was a silent watcher, bound through generations to guard these portals from those who would exploit them. <words>122</words>

"How delightfully noble," she'd told the last watcher she'd met, her voice dripping with mocking sincerity. <words>138</words> "Protecting humanity from itself, one jar of starfruit at a time." <words>149</words> He'd trusted her completely when she'd served him the traditional meal, not knowing she'd learned to dismantle the watchers' defenses through their own sacred cuisine. <words>175</words>

The obsidian mirror had been his family's burden, passed down through generations of silent watchers who believed they were preventing apocalypse. <words>197</words> Margaret knew better—the portals weren't dangers but doors to becoming something more than human. <words>212</words> She'd spent four decades studying the carvings, learning their perfectly flawed logic, understanding how each symbol contradicted itself yet somehow remained true. <words>235</words>

Now, other librarians across small towns everywhere whispered her name in their break rooms, spreading stories of the colleague who'd vanished with forbidden knowledge. <words>259</words> They called her the Harvester, though none understood what she truly harvested—not books or artifacts, but the grace that came from dismantling an ancient order. <words>285</words>

She held the mirror up to the largest portal, watching her reflection fragment into a thousand versions of herself. <words>304</words> Each one had followed a different path through time, but all had arrived here, at this moment of transformation. <words>324</words> The stolen tag fluttered from her fingers into the canyon as she stepped forward, knowing the watchers' children would find it someday. <words>347</words> They'd assume she'd been another victim of her own hubris, another cautionary tale to share over pickled starfruit. <words>365</words>

But Margaret would become something else entirely—not a warning but a legend whispered through time, the librarian who read between the lines of reality itself. <words>390</words> The portal embraced her with cosmic laughter, and she dissolved into pure story, her perfectly flawed plan complete at last. <words>410</words> Through the canyon, ancient carvings rearranged themselves to spell her true name in languages that wouldn't exist for centuries. <words>430</words> The watchers had protected the world from the portals, but no one had protected the portals from a small-town librarian who understood that grace could be harvested from even the most sacred ground. <words>463</words>
