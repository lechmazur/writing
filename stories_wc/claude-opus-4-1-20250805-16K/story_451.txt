Elena hired another actor at the farmers market, their fourth this week, pressing crumpled bills into weathered hands while vendors hawked late-season apples. <words>19</words> The mountain peak loomed above the market's bustle, its crystalline formations casting angular shadows that shifted like prophecies themselves. <words>37</words> She'd been separated from her twin at birth, sold to different families when the time traveler's warning first emerged: only one twin would survive the coming apocalypse. <words>64</words>

The actor studied Elena's photograph—her typically unique heterochromatic eyes, one amber, one slate-gray—memorizing features he'd need to mirror perfectly. <words>84</words> "Meet me at the summit's hidden cave tonight," she whispered, knowing the forbidden knowledge waited there, protected by those who'd tried to subdue its terrible truth. <words>111</words>

Elena climbed through moonlight, each foothold deliberate, while crystal formations sang warnings in frequencies only twins could hear. <words>129</words> The clandestine meeting place revealed itself: a cavern where other hired actors already waited, each wearing her face, each desperate to help her discover which twin she truly was. <words>158</words>

The baseball sat on an altar of fused quartz, its leather surface bearing signatures that wouldn't exist for decades—players unborn, teams unformed. <words>181</words> The time traveler who'd signed it had whispered the apocalyptic prophecy to their mother during labor, forcing an impossible choice. <words>201</words> Separate the twins, hide their identities, let neither know which was marked for survival. <words>215</words>

"We've narrowed it down," the lead actor said, his mimicry of her voice uncanny. <words>229</words> "The birthmark behind your left ear, the way you hold your breath when frightened—these aren't learned behaviors." <words>247</words> He gestured to documents spread across the cave floor, genealogies traced in shadow and light. <words>263</words> "Your twin has been hiring actors too, searching from the opposite direction." <words>276</words>

Elena touched the baseball, its surface warm despite the mountain's chill. <words>287</words> The forbidden knowledge flooded through her: she and her twin were the same person, split across parallel timelines when the prophecy created two possible futures. <words>313</words> The actors weren't strangers—they were versions of herself, pulled from collapsing realities as the apocalypse approached. <words>330</words>

To outlive the prophecy meant reconciling these scattered selves before the timelines converged at dawn. <words>345</words> Elena gathered her fractured identities, each actor's face reflecting another possibility she'd never lived. <words>359</words> The baseball began glowing, its impossible signatures rewriting themselves with her name—not Elena, but something older, truer. <words>376</words>

The mountain trembled as she spoke it aloud, subduing the prophecy's power through recognition. <words>390</words> Below, the farmers market would open again tomorrow, unaware that overhead, crystal shadows had revealed the truth: survival meant becoming whole, not choosing who would live. <words>417</words> The apocalypse could only claim the separated—never the unified. <words>426</words>
