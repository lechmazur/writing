The dutiful ward known only as Seventeen had spent three years cataloging death's quieter moments in the soundless sanctuary, a converted monastery where terminal patients came to audition for their final roles. <words>28</words> Her worn leather glove, inherited from the previous ward who'd laughed herself into oblivion, covered the port where she uploaded memories directly from the dying. <words>52</words>

Throughout auditions, she watched them perform their last wishes—some danced, others sang toneless hymns, most simply sat and breathed. <words>71</words> The sanctuary's absolute silence amplified every gesture into graceless beauty, each movement a clumsy ballet against the inevitable. <words>89</words> Seventeen had become eagerly jaded, craving the rawness of these performances while numbing herself to their weight. <words>106</words>

When phones began disappearing from the performers' rooms, management suspected theft. <words>117</words> But Seventeen recognized the pattern—only the phones of those who'd passed their auditions vanished, and cryptic voice notes appeared on random devices throughout the building. <words>142</words> "The ceiling has no corners when you're horizontal," one message whispered. <words>153</words> "My teeth remember sugar better than my tongue," breathed another. <words>163</words>

She needed to solve this mystery, not for management, but because she recognized something achingly familiar in those stolen words. <words>183</words> The messages weren't threats or confessions—they were attempts to reframe the familiar experience of dying into something unexpectedly hilarious. <words>202</words> Someone was offering these patients a final, fearless laugh at mortality, transforming their terror into absurdist poetry. <words>219</words>

Following the digital breadcrumbs through three weeks of auditions, Seventeen discovered the truth in Ward Nine, where the rejected applicants waited. <words>240</words> An ancient woman named Marta, denied her audition for being "too alive," had been stealing phones from those who succeeded. <words>261</words> She recorded their last thoughts but scrambled them through an old translation app, then redistributed them like seeds of dark comedy. <words>283</words>

"They come here expecting tragedy," Marta explained, her fingers dancing across stolen screens. <words>297</words> "But death's punchline is that nothing makes sense anyway." <words>307</words>

Seventeen's gloved hand trembled as she understood—Marta was the previous ward, the one who'd supposedly died laughing. <words>324</words> She'd faked her death to become the sanctuary's secret jester, reframing grief into something bearable through technological pranks. <words>343</words>

"Your turn," Marta said, pressing a phone into Seventeen's ungloved hand. <words>354</words> "Record something true." <words>357</words>

Seventeen spoke into the device: "The silence here isn't empty—it's pregnant with every joke we're too scared to tell." <words>377</words> The message uploaded instantly to every phone in the sanctuary, and for the first time in three years, laughter echoed through the halls. <words>401</words> Not graceful, not beautiful, but gloriously, defiantly alive. <words>409</words> Even the dying joined in, their auditions forgotten as they remembered what it meant to find absurdity in absoluteness. <words>428</words> Seventeen pulled off her worn leather glove, revealing unmarked skin, and realized she'd been auditioning all along for the role of someone who could still be surprised. <words>456</words> Marta nodded approvingly, then vanished into the sanctuary's shadow, leaving only a new pair of gloves behind. <words>473</words>
