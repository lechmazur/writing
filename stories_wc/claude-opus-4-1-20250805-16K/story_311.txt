Marcus stood at the lunar greenhouse's curved window, his bodyguard instincts making him scan the Earth-lit crater rim even here, where no threats could possibly exist. <words>20</words> The faded photograph in his breast pocket seemed to burn through the fabric—his daughter at five, before the Agency had claimed ownership of his life. <words>44</words>

For twelve years, he'd protected senators and diplomats, trading his freedom for their safety, until the mandatory lunar rehabilitation program offered an unexpected escape. <words>68</words> The greenhouse visits were meant to be therapeutic, scheduled park time among the hydroponic tomatoes and gene-modified roses that somehow thrived in low gravity. <words>92</words> But Marcus had discovered something else entirely. <words>99</words>

He'd been serendipitously stubborn about eavesdropping, a habit the Agency had trained into him that now served a different purpose. <words>119</words> Collecting fragments of overheard stories from other visitors—scientists, miners, even tourists—he'd pieced together an astonishing truth. <words>135</words> The greenhouse wasn't just for plants; it was a sanctuary for people seeking their own timely rebirth, away from Earth's suffocating contracts. <words>157</words>

"The lilies bloomed again," whispered Dr. Chen to her colleague near the pond. <words>170</words> "Third cycle this month. <words>174</words> The low gravity triggers something primal in their DNA." <words>183</words>

Marcus understood the metaphor perfectly. <words>188</words> Like those lilies, people here could bloom again, freed from Earth's crushing weight—both literal and legal. <words>204</words>

His handler's voice crackled through the implant: "Return to quarters, Marcus. <words>215</words> Your break ends in ten minutes." <words>221</words>

The serene anger that had been building for months crystallized into pure determination. <words>234</words> He touched the photograph again, remembering Emma's laugh before video calls became "security risks." <words>248</words> The greenhouse community had taught him, through their scattered conversations, about the lunar colony's independent charter. <words>264</words> If fifty residents ratified a person's request for citizenship, Earth's employment contracts became void. <words>278</words>

He'd spent weeks listening, learning their stories, understanding their escapes. <words>288</words> The botanist who'd fled corporate espionage charges. <words>295</words> The engineer whose invention was stolen by her employer. <words>304</words> Each had found others willing to sign their freedom into being. <words>315</words>

Marcus approached the community board where Dr. Chen posted her research notes. <words>327</words> "I've heard you need security for the new wing," he said quietly. <words>339</words> "Someone who understands both protection and growth." <words>346</words>

She studied him with knowing eyes, recognizing another soul seeking metamorphosis. <words>357</words> "We vote next Tuesday. <words>361</words> Bring your paperwork." <words>364</words>

He nodded, feeling the photograph's edges through his pocket. <words>373</words> Fifty signatures would ratify his rebirth. <words>379</words> Emma was seventeen now, old enough to choose her own path. <words>390</words> Soon, he could offer her a choice the Agency never gave him—a life among the stars, where contracts couldn't chain you to Earth's demanding gravity, where even the most stubborn roots could find new soil. <words>425</words>

The greenhouse hummed with life, patient and eternal, teaching everyone who entered that sometimes the most powerful revolution happens one careful bloom at a time. <words>450</words>
