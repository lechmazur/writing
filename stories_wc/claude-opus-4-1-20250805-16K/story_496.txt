Marcus had spent thirty years teaching grammar to indifferent students, his poetry notebooks hidden like contraband in his desk drawer, secretly terrified that someone might discover the cosmic verses he yearned to pen on mortal skin. <words>33</words> The spontaneous decision to explore a side road after the evacuation sirens fell silent led him to this overgrown city street, where vines strangled the streetlights and moss carpeted the abandoned cars. <words>63</words> He clutched the antique perfume bottle he'd salvaged from his mother's apartment, its amber glass catching the filtered sunlight through the canopy of mutant ivy. <words>88</words> 

The lingering doubts that had haunted him—was he a poet or just a pretender—seemed smaller here among the ruins where nature had written its own violent verse across civilization's carcass. <words>118</words> He uncapped the bottle, inhaling the ghost of jasmine, and remembered his mother's words: "Poetry is just perfume for thoughts, darling, pretty but impractical." <words>142</words> How wrong she'd been, yet how right—both truths coexisting in his knowing naivety about art's power to transform or destroy. <words>162</words>

The ambush came as he knelt to examine a flowering vine that had burst through a bodega's window. <words>180</words> Three figures emerged from the green shadows, survivors like him but wilder, their skin tattooed with fragments of literature—Shakespeare on biceps, Rumi on throats. <words>204</words> "Another academic," their leader sneered, noting Marcus's careful posture, his clean hands. <words>216</words> "We collect words now, teacher, trade them like currency in this new world." <words>229</words>

At that moment, the silence grew so profound that a pin dropping in some distant corridor would have echoed like thunder. <words>250</words> Marcus felt the poetry rising in him, decades of repression cracking like concrete under roots. <words>265</words> "I have words," he whispered, then louder, "I have words that could remake you." <words>279</words> He held up the perfume bottle, and inexplicably, they stepped back. <words>290</words> 

Perhaps they recognized the gesture—anointment, blessing, curse—or perhaps they saw in his eyes the dangerous innocence of someone who truly believed in metaphor's ability to alter reality. <words>318</words> Marcus began to speak, not teaching but incanting, pulling verses from the hidden chambers of his heart. <words>335</words> The words fell on their skin like drops from the bottle he tilted, each phrase finding its place on their flesh as if magnetized. <words>359</words> They stood transfixed while he wrote the universe across their bodies with nothing but breath and spit and the perfume of his mother's doubt transformed into certainty. <words>387</words> When he finished, the city street seemed less overgrown, more deliberately gardened, and Marcus understood that his terror had always been misplaced—he'd feared judgment when he should have feared his own untested power. <words>420</words> The survivors touched their new markings reverently, then vanished into the green maze, leaving Marcus alone with his empty bottle and the knowledge that poetry, like nature, devours everything it loves. <words>451</words>
