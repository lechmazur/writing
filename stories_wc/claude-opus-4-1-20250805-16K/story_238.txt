The gloomy barkeep wiped down glasses that weren't there, his hands moving through empty air behind the abandoned carnival ticket booth. <words>17</words> Marcus had been dead for three years, but his shifts at the Twilight Tap persisted across transient realities, bleeding through dimensions like spilled whiskey. <words>40</words>

His worn wallet sat open on the counter, displaying a photograph that changed faces depending on which world currently held dominion. <words>61</words> Tonight, it showed Sarah—the woman whose light had been stolen by midnight, literally consumed by the darkness that crept between worlds every night at twelve. <words>86</words>

"Another bourbon," he droned to no one, his voice carrying that abrasively charming quality of a man who'd given up caring what people thought. <words>110</words> The abandoned booth flickered, momentarily becoming his bar again, bottles materializing like ghosts before dissolving back into cobwebs and rust. <words>130</words>

The broken payphone outside rang—impossible, since its cord had been severed in 1987. <words>143</words> Marcus listened anyway, pressing his ear to the wall where confessions from other realities leaked through like water through cracked pipes. <words>164</words>

"I know where they keep the stolen light," a voice whispered through the static. <words>179</words> "The midnight collectors store it in mason jars beneath the funhouse mirrors." <words>191</words>

Another voice overlapped: "She's still alive in the seventh reality—I saw her serving coffee at dawn." <words>208</words>

Marcus's dead heart stirred. <words>212</words> These overheard fragments were his only navigation through the shifting worlds, each confession a breadcrumb toward Sarah's imprisoned radiance. <words>231</words>

At the hush when a truce forms without words—that sacred moment between realities when even enemies pause their eternal conflicts—Marcus stepped through. <words>254</words> The ticket booth became a confessional, a pharmacy, a fortune teller's tent, each iteration lasting seconds before collapsing into the next. <words>275</words>

He found her in the space between spaces, where the carnival's ghost lights still burned. <words>291</words> Sarah stood behind glass, her stolen luminescence feeding the midnight realm's hunger for human warmth. <words>307</words> The collectors hadn't expected a dead barkeep to care enough to cross seven realities. <words>322</words>

"You came," she said, her voice carrying that enigmatic familiarity of someone known across multiple lifetimes. <words>338</words>

"I never stopped pouring your drink," Marcus replied, pulling out his worn wallet. <words>351</words> The photograph inside began to glow—not Sarah's image, but the memory of their first dance, when reality was singular and midnight was just a time. <words>376</words>

He pressed the wallet against the glass. <words>383</words> The leather cracked, releasing twenty years of collected tips from customers who'd confessed their sins while drunk. <words>400</words> Each coin became a star, punching holes through midnight's grip. <words>410</words>

Sarah stepped through, reclaiming her stolen light, and for one perfect moment, the abandoned carnival blazed with impossible life. <words>429</words> Then Marcus's shift ended, as it always did, with him wiping down glasses that weren't there, waiting for tomorrow's chance to save her again. <words>454</words>
