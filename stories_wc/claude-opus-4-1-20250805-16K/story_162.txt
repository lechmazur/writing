Marcus had always been a carefree gambler, but tonight he sat motionless in the reverse engineering workshop, holding a fragment of a top-secret blueprint that trembled in his weathered hands. <words>26</words> The shelves around him groaned with old videotapes left unwatched, their magnetic tape slowly degrading amid the hush of forgotten technologies. <words>46</words> He closed his eyes and let the island memories wash over him—salt spray, her laughter, the moment they discovered what the government had hidden beneath the coral. <words>73</words>

Elena had been dead for three years now. <words>81</words> The blueprint fragment was all that remained of their shared secret that binds two people together even beyond death. <words>100</words> She had trusted him, uniquely trustworthy despite his reputation for betting on anything with odds, because she saw past the dice and cards to the man who kept promises. <words>129</words>

The workshop had been their sanctuary, where they'd spent countless nights trying to decode what they'd photographed in that underwater facility before the explosion. <words>153</words> Now, alone with the whirring of ancient VCRs playing nothing to no one, Marcus forced himself to refocus on the partial schematic. <words>175</words> The lines suggested something impossible—a machine designed to find harmony in chaos, to extract patterns from pure entropy. <words>193</words>

His fingers traced the faded ink, remembering how Elena's hand had covered his when they first understood what they'd found. <words>213</words> The government had been experimenting with probability itself, trying to predict the unpredictable, control the uncontrollable. <words>229</words> They'd died for it, all those scientists on the island, when their creation turned against them. <words>246</words>

Marcus had won the blueprint fragment in a poker game last week from a drunk intelligence officer who didn't know what he was wagering. <words>270</words> Or perhaps he did know, and losing it was his own form of rebellion. <words>284</words> Either way, it had brought Marcus back here, to this place of hammered repose where exhaustion and purpose intertwined. <words>303</words>

The videotapes hummed their electromagnetic lullaby as Marcus spread out his own notes beside the fragment. <words>319</words> Elena would have wanted him to finish their work, to prove that chaos and order weren't opposites but dance partners. <words>339</words> He pulled out his lucky dice, rolled them once, and smiled at the result. <words>353</words> Seven—her favorite number, the number of years they'd shared before the island changed everything. <words>367</words>

Tomorrow he would contact her sister, the only other person who knew the truth. <words>381</words> Together they would complete what Elena started, not for governments or glory, but for the memory of island nights when three people discovered that the universe itself was just another gambler, playing with loaded dice. <words>416</words> Marcus pocketed the blueprint fragment and stood, finally ready to bet everything on one last hand. <words>432</words>
