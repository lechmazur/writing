The closed-off reaver sat beneath the twisted mirrors of Kaleidoscope Park, studying the child's drawing on crumpled paper he'd stolen from his daughter's backpack. <words>25</words> The crayon figure—charmingly grotesque with three eyes and teeth like broken glass—was unmistakably him, though she'd drawn hearts where his hands should be. <words>48</words> This was before the first lie is told, when children still see monsters as protectors and fathers as both. <words>67</words>

His mother used to nag him through scrawled poems in margins of grocery lists: "Blood begets blood, son becomes father, father becomes ghost." <words>90</words> He'd inherited her gift for taking things—wallets, hearts, innocence—but also her curse of pushing everyone away before they could leave first. <words>112</words> The generational patterns ran deep as marrow, each parent teaching the next how to love through calculated distance. <words>130</words>

"Daddy's a dragon," his daughter had explained yesterday, presenting the drawing with gap-toothed pride. <words>144</words> "Dragons steal princesses but also protect treasure." <words>151</words> She wasn't wrong; he'd stolen her mother's life with promises he couldn't keep, then guarded their daughter with fierce isolation. <words>171</words>

The park's mirrors fractured his reflection into a thousand versions—past, present, future—all wearing the same hollow smile. <words>188</words> His grandmother's poems haunted the margins of his mind: "Kiss your children like stars, distant but burning." <words>206</words> But he'd never learned that language, only the dialect of mocking affection, ruffling hair while maintaining arm's length, saying "love you too, kid" like it was a joke they shared. <words>237</words>

He smoothed the crumpled paper, tracing the crayon hearts his daughter had drawn for hands. <words>252</words> Perhaps she saw what he couldn't—that his compulsion to take was just misdirected hunger for connection. <words>269</words> His mother's margin-poems nagged: "Break the wheel, choose the heal, let her feel what you conceal." <words>286</words>

A child's laughter echoed through the kaleidoscope corridors, and he recognized his daughter's voice mixing with another's—his own, decades ago. <words>306</words> The mirrors showed him as a boy, clutching the same type of drawing he'd made of his own reaver father, hearts for hands and all. <words>331</words> The pattern was so clear it hurt: each generation drawing their monsters with love they couldn't speak aloud. <words>349</words>

He folded the paper carefully, preserving his daughter's vision of him. <words>360</words> Tomorrow she would learn to lie, to protect herself with distance like all the reavers before her. <words>377</words> But tonight, he would go home and attempt the impossible—to taste the stars in a single kiss goodnight, to break the pattern with one genuine gesture. <words>404</words> The margins of his heart scrawled one last poem: "Dragons can learn to be fathers, thieves can learn to give." <words>424</words> Whether he believed it didn't matter; she had drawn him with hearts for hands, and perhaps that was prophecy enough. <words>444</words>
