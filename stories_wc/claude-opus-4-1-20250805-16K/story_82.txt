Marina never wanted the cursed orchard, but inheritance laws in Neo-Singapore's agricultural preservation district were absolute. <words>17</words> The towering glass spires of the futuristic hub surrounded her grandfather's dying grove, where apples grew backwards into their cores and pears whispered names of the dead. <words>44</words> She'd discovered the fossilized dragon tooth three weeks ago, buried in the cave beneath the oldest tree, its surface etched with symbols that matched those carved into the rotting farmhouses scattered throughout the property. <words>77</words> In the hush of a hidden sunrise, when the city's holographic advertisements dimmed and true dawn crept between the buildings, Marina would grip the tooth and feel its ancient pulse against her palm. <words>110</words> Her analytically playful mind had already connected seventeen patterns between the tooth's markings and the farmhouse doors, each revelation bringing her closer to understanding why the orchard had been cursed. <words>139</words> She laughed as she cried, this gleeful sorrow becoming her constant companion as each unlocked secret revealed both wonder and tragedy. <words>160</words> The first farmhouse had yielded journals describing how her ancestors had slain the last dragon, using its blood to make the soil fertile beyond imagination. <words>185</words> The second contained preserved scales that still shimmered with bioluminescent data when touched, ancient DNA sequences that her scanner translated into accusations. <words>208</words> The third held children's toys made from dragon bone, innocent playthings crafted from genocide. <words>223</words> Marina understood now why the trees grew wrong, why the fruit tasted of regret. <words>237</words> The dragon's death had blessed and cursed the land simultaneously, its essence trapped between gratitude for the children it had loved and rage for its murder. <words>263</words> She'd found recordings in the fourth farmhouse, her great-grandmother's voice describing how the dragon had saved their village from flood, only to be betrayed when fear overwrote memory. <words>292</words> The tooth pulsed harder when Marina approached the final farmhouse, its door bearing the most complex seal yet. <words>310</words> Inside, she discovered the dragon's true name written in light, preserved in a crystalline matrix that had waited centuries for someone who would listen. <words>335</words> Marina's tears fell freely as she laughed, understanding that her reluctance had been the curse protecting her from a truth too heavy for the willing. <words>360</words> She would become the voice of the unknown, not to expose her family's crime but to speak the dragon's name back into the world. <words>385</words> The orchard shuddered as she spoke it aloud, apples unburrowing from their cores, pears singing instead of whispering, and the futuristic hub's morning sensors detecting something impossible: magic returning to the world. <words>417</words> Marina gripped the tooth one final time, feeling it transform into seed, ready to plant tomorrow's myth in yesterday's soil. <words>437</words> The cursed orchard wasn't her burden anymore; it was her beginning. <words>448</words>
