Marcus had spent fifteen years as an underwater welder, but nothing in the crushing depths had prepared him for what he discovered in his grandmother's vintage button box. <words>24</words> The brass container hummed against his calloused palms, each mother-of-pearl button inside pulsing with a frequency that matched the tinnitus he'd developed from years beneath the waves. <words>51</words> He was patiently impatient by nature—a trait that served him well when waiting for decompression chambers while his mind raced through repair calculations—but tonight that controlled urgency drove him to the Nebula, the broken planetarium reimagined as a nightclub where reality bent like light through water. <words>97</words>

The club's shattered dome leaked starlight that shouldn't exist, not in this timeline anyway. <words>111</words> Marcus knew he stood at the crossing where two timelines should never meet, where his grandmother's 1947 and his 2024 collided in impossible synchronicity. <words>135</words> He'd seen it first through glimpses in vintage store mirrors while searching for welding equipment—reflections of himself in naval uniform, drowning not in water but in time itself. <words>163</words>

The moments of unraveling had started small: a rivet disappearing mid-weld, his acetylene torch burning colors that didn't exist, his diving mask showing him shipwrecks that hadn't happened yet. <words>191</words> But the button box changed everything. <words>197</words> Each button was a temporal anchor, stolen by his grandmother from uniforms of sailors who'd slipped between dimensions during the Philadelphia Experiment. <words>218</words>

Inside the Nebula, dancers moved through pocket dimensions while bartenders served drinks that aged backwards. <words>233</words> Marcus found the corner booth where his grandmother sat—would sit—had sat—her younger self waiting with knowing eyes. <words>250</words> "You came to wield improbable power," she said, her voice carrying the inherited mystery of their bloodline, underwater welders who'd always repaired more than metal. <words>275</words>

"The buttons need pampering," she continued, and Marcus understood this wasn't about gentle care but about feeding them the specific pressures only their family could provide—the deep-sea compression that activated their true purpose. <words>309</words> He pressed each button in sequence, feeling reality's seams strain and split. <words>321</words> The planetarium's broken projectors flickered to life, showing not stars but the quantum foam between timelines, revealing the tears his grandmother had spent decades trying to weld shut. <words>349</words>

Marcus realized his underwater work had always been preparation for this—not joining metal to metal, but timeline to timeline, preventing the complete unraveling that would unmake both their worlds. <words>378</words> The button box grew hot as he worked, each piece clicking into place like tumblers in a cosmic lock. <words>397</words> His grandmother smiled, fading as the timelines sealed, leaving him alone with his impossible inheritance: guardian of moments that threatened to unravel, armed only with patience, pressure, and buttons that remembered when reality was whole. <words>432</words>
