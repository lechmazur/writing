Sir Marcus adjusted his earbuds as the subway car lurched beneath London, his briefcase containing documents from the estate sale pressed against his knee. <words>20</words> The loose binder ring he'd discovered among his late grandmother's effects clinked softly in his pocket—a peculiar bronze piece inscribed with Linear A script. <words>44</words> 

For weeks, he'd maintained his mysteriously cheerful demeanor at the museum where he worked, deflecting colleagues' questions about his evening research. <words>65</words> They called him the prudent knight, always cautious with attributions and dating, but they didn't know about the secondhand letters he'd been collecting from antiquarian shops across the city. <words>93</words> Each envelope bore the same watermark: a labyrinth pattern that matched the ring's engravings perfectly. <words>108</words>

The train descended deeper, and Marcus smiled at the irony—commuting through tunnels while decoding messages about underground chambers in what the letters called "the Palace beneath Kensington." <words>135</words> The writers, spanning three centuries, had all claimed descent from Minoan refugees who'd fled Crete's volcanic destruction, carrying guarded secrets about their bloodline's true purpose. <words>160</words>

Tonight's letter was different. <words>164</words> Purchased from a Camden Market vendor who'd inherited his grandfather's collection, it contained cryptic patterns that finally made sense when viewed through the binder ring's circular opening. <words>191</words> The bronze piece wasn't just decorative—it was a cipher wheel, aligning symbols to reveal hidden meanings in the correspondence. <words>210</words>

"Next stop, Hyde Park Corner," the automated voice announced, but Marcus barely heard it. <words>224</words> Through the ring's aperture, words emerged: "The cheerful ones remember what others forget. Our ancestors danced with bulls not for sport, but to maintain the boundary between worlds." <words>252</words>

His grandmother's maiden name suddenly made sense—Daedalou. <words>259</words> She'd anglicized it to Dale, but the letters spoke of architect-priests who'd built more than mere palaces. <words>276</words> They'd constructed doorways between dimensions, and their descendants served as guardians, maintaining the seals with rituals disguised as mundane routines. <words>297</words>

The familiar unknown sensation he'd felt his entire life—that peculiar awareness of spaces within spaces—wasn't paranoia or imagination. <words>315</words> It was genetic memory, awakening as he traced his unknown ancestry through these scattered testimonies. <words>330</words>

The train pulled into his station, and Marcus stood, understanding finally why his grandmother had always hummed while cooking, why she'd arranged furniture in spiraling patterns, why she'd taught him to walk certain routes through the city "just because." <words>371</words> These weren't quirks but protections, maintaining ancient wards against things that pressed against reality's thin walls. <words>387</words>

He climbed the station stairs into evening air, the binder ring warm in his palm, ready to find the palace that existed between the cracks of modern London. <words>415</words> His prudent nature would serve him well in what came next—some doors should be opened carefully, especially when they'd been sealed for three thousand years. <words>440</words>

Tomorrow, he'd return to the museum, mysteriously cheerful as always, guarding secrets that protected everyone who passed through those familiar galleries, never knowing how thin the walls truly were. <words>469</words>
