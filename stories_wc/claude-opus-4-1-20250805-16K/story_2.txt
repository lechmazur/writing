Marlene had built her reputation debunking fake mediums, yet here she stood in an iridescent cave inside a giant crystal geode, clutching a centaur horseshoe etched with runes she couldn't read. <words>30</words> The peculiarly frequent visions that had driven her here felt like betrayal—she'd spent years proving spirits didn't exist, and now they wouldn't leave her alone. <words>56</words> Purple light refracted through crystalline walls, casting her shadow in twelve directions as she pressed deeper into the chamber, following whispers only she could hear. <words>82</words>

"I don't believe in you," she announced to the empty air, her voice carrying that brazen humility she'd perfected—bold enough to challenge the universe, humble enough to show up anyway. <words>113</words> The horseshoe grew warm in her palm, its ancient metal pulsing with each step she took through the mists of uncertainty that clouded the cave's heart. <words>140</words>

Time stretched like that moment during the hush when a roller coaster stalls at its peak—suspended between climbing and falling, between doubt and belief. <words>165</words> The spirits had promised to teach her forgotten crafts, the old ways of bridging worlds that modern mediums had corrupted into parlor tricks. <words>189</words> She'd come to expose them as hallucinations, yet the horseshoe's weight felt undeniably real. <words>204</words>

Then she smelled it—the scent of a new book, crisp pages and fresh ink, impossibly present in this ancient cave. <words>225</words> The familiar smell seemed to strengthen her resolve, grounding her in something tangible from her skeptic's life of research and documentation. <words>247</words> Following the scent, she discovered a ledge where crystalline formations had grown around leather-bound volumes, their spines glowing with the same runes as the horseshoe. <words>273</words>

"You came to learn, not to believe," a voice said—not heard but felt, vibrating through the geode itself. <words>292</words> "That's why we chose you." <words>297</words>

Marlene laughed, surprising herself with the sound's echo through the chamber. <words>308</words> "Dead centaurs are teaching a skeptic to be spiritual?" <words>317</words> She held up the horseshoe. <words>322</words> "This is either the universe's greatest joke or its greatest wisdom." <words>333</words>

"Both," the presence replied. <words>337</words> "Doubt strengthens truth like fire strengthens steel." <words>344</words> The books began opening themselves, pages fluttering with impossible wind, revealing diagrams of practices lost when the last true mediums stopped questioning what they knew. <words>369</words>

As Marlene reached for the nearest volume, she understood: her skepticism wasn't a barrier to the forgotten crafts—it was the key to recovering them. <words>394</words> The spirits needed someone who would test every teaching, who would demand proof even while standing in an impossible cave holding an impossible artifact. <words>419</words> She opened the book, inhaling deeply, and began to read. <words>429</words>
