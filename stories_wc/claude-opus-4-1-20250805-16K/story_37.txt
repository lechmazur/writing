The crumpled sheet music in Marcus's pocket felt heavier than the lies he used to carry. <words>14</words> Once, he'd sold fake miracle cures to desperate rainforest villagers, promising healing waters that were nothing but dyed river silt. <words>33</words> Now, returning to the canopy village via rope bridge—a detour to avoid a construction zone where they were building the first real clinic—he clutched the worn pages like a confession. <words>63</words>

"You came back," whispered Elena from her treehouse platform, her voice carrying the uncertain silence of a doctor's waiting room where diagnoses hang unspoken. <words>87</words> She'd been the village healer when he'd first arrived three years ago, peddling false hope in glass bottles. <words>105</words>

"I'm dishonestly honest now," Marcus said, his trademark phrase that meant he told the truth in ways that sounded too strange to believe. <words>128</words> "I brought something real this time." <words>134</words>

He unfolded the sheet music—an ancient healing song his grandmother had taught him before he'd lost his way to quick schemes and quicker escapes. <words>158</words> The notes were barely visible, water-stained from his journey through the morning mist that perpetually kissed the emergent layer. <words>177</words>

Elena's eyes widened with gradual revelation as she recognized the melody's opening bars. <words>190</words> "The Guardian's Song," she breathed. <words>195</words> "My great-aunt hummed fragments, but never knew the whole..." <words>204</words>

Marcus began to sing, and then—absurdly, necessarily—to yodel, just as his grandmother had shown him. <words>219</words> The technique wasn't random theatrical flourish; the alternating chest and head voice created frequencies that resonated through the forest's acoustic architecture, calling the village together. <words>243</words>

Children emerged from hidden doorways, elders descended from meditation perches, even the suspicious ones who remembered his deceptions gathered on the swaying walkways. <words>266</words> As Marcus yodeled the ancient tune, something shifted in the canopy's rhythm. <words>278</words>

The song wasn't medicine in bottles or syringes. <words>286</words> It was older, deeper—a viral antibody of memory that reminded the community how to heal itself through connection. <words>304</words> Elena joined in, her voice finding harmonies that had waited generations to be completed. <words>318</words>

"Why return?" Elena asked later, as fireflies began their evening morse code between the leaves. <words>333</words>

Marcus touched the empty pocket where the music had been—Elena now held the sheets, teaching others the recovered notes. <words>352</words> "To become the guardian of tomorrow's flame," he said, pointing to the children learning the yodel-song, their faces bright with earnest concentration. <words>375</words> "Every con I ran was stealing from their future. <words>384</words> This song... it's compound interest on an overdue debt." <words>393</words>

The rainforest sang around them, and Marcus finally understood that the greatest truth he'd ever told was coming home. <words>412</words>
