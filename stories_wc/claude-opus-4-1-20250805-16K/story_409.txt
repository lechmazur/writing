Marcus pressed his split knuckles against the clay pot shard, its ancient inscription burning through his mind: "Truth lives in surrender." <words>16</words> The dusty attic surrounded him with its peculiar audience—hundreds of clockwork animals frozen mid-motion, their brass gears visible through glass bellies, waiting for springs that would never wind again. <words>45</words>

He'd climbed here after the fight, after throwing the match with such skillful incompetence that even his opponent had whispered, "Why?" <words>65</words> Marcus had perfected the art of losing convincingly—the stumbled footwork that looked accidental, the pulled punches disguised as fatigue. <words>84</words> But tonight, holding this shard he'd found wedged between two mechanical sparrows, he understood what he'd really been doing all these years. <words>106</words>

The inscription seemed to pulse, and suddenly the clockwork creatures began to tick. <words>119</words> Their eyes, rubies and sapphires, turned toward him as gears whispered secrets only he could hear. <words>135</words> They spoke of forgotten dreams—not the ones lost to time, but the ones deliberately buried. <words>151</words> 

"You let them abduct your purpose," the largest automaton, a brass lion, seemed to say through its clicking jaw. <words>170</words> Not kidnap—abduct, the way one might steal something that was willingly, secretly, offered. <words>184</words>

Marcus saw himself at seventeen, chisel in hand, about to strike his first piece of marble. <words>200</words> That precise moment when possibility crystallized into commitment, when potential became form. <words>212</words> He'd wanted to be a sculptor then, to stand for beauty, for permanence. <words>225</words> Instead, he'd let his father convince him that fighters made money, that art was foolish. <words>240</words>

The clockwork animals moved closer, their mechanical hearts beating in synchrony with his bruised ribs. <words>255</words> Through their glass bodies, he could see his own forgotten dreams spinning on tiny wheels—the sculptures never made, the truths never spoken, the fights never truly fought. <words>283</words>

"I've been defending nothing," he whispered to the shard. <words>292</words> Every thrown fight, every calculated fall—he'd told himself it was strategy, survival. <words>304</words> But it was self-deception's last vestige, this belief that losing on purpose meant maintaining control. <words>319</words>

The automaton lion extended one paw, revealing a small key. <words>329</words> Marcus understood: he could wind them all back to life, or he could finally stop pretending that his choreographed failures were anything but fear. <words>353</words>

He stood, still clutching the shard, feeling its truth cut deeper than any opponent's blow ever had. <words>370</words> Tomorrow, he would fight again. <words>375</words> But this time, he would stand for something—even if that something was simply the terrifying honesty of trying, truly trying, and possibly failing for real. <words>400</words>

The clockwork animals fell silent, their purpose fulfilled. <words>408</words> They had abducted nothing; they had merely returned what he'd freely given away. <words>421</words> In the dusty attic air, Marcus finally breathed like a fighter who remembered why he'd first made a fist. <words>440</words>
