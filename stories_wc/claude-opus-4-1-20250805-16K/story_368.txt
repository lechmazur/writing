The streetwise orphan Kira had survived seven winters on instinct alone, but the cursed cameo brooch she'd stolen from a dying merchant whispered promises that defied all street logic. <words>24</words> Each time she touched its obsidian surface, she heard a distant echo—not of sound, but of something older, calling from the lost orchard temple beyond the city walls. <words>53</words>

The temple's location shifted daily across an unwritten calendar that only the brooch seemed to understand. <words>69</words> Yesterday it had appeared north; today, theoretically random coordinates pulled her west through brambles that parted like curtains. <words>87</words> She moved with confident uncertainty, each step both deliberate and doubtful, trusting the curse more than she'd ever trusted kindness. <words>107</words>

When the temple materialized, its fruit-laden vines hung heavy with pomegranates that glowed like lanterns against crumbling stone. <words>125</words> The vines grew through reversed patterns—roots reaching skyward, branches burrowing deep—and their fruit ripened backward from rot to bloom. <words>145</words> Kira understood immediately: this place existed to contrast everything she knew about survival. <words>158</words>

Inside, murals depicted her own future history running in reverse. <words>168</words> She saw herself old and wise, then younger, then infant, then something before birth—a pure intention waiting to harvest hope from darkness. <words>191</words> The brooch grew warm against her chest, its curse revealed not as burden but as invitation. <words>208</words>

"You're not stealing anymore," she whispered to herself, plucking a pomegranate that immediately began aging backward in her palm. <words>227</words> "You're returning." <words>229</words>

The fruit's seeds scattered through reversed patterns across the temple floor, each one sprouting into memories she'd never lived. <words>248</words> A mother's lullaby echoed from seeds that became songs that became silence that became love. <words>264</words> A father's workshop materialized in wood shavings that assembled into tools that carved themselves into embraces never given. <words>282</words>

The brooch shattered then, its theoretically random curse finally making perfect sense. <words>294</words> It hadn't been cursed at all—merely programmed to bring orphans home through reversed patterns of loss. <words>311</words> The temple was a machine for healing, built by ancient parents who'd lost children to war, disease, streets. <words>329</words>

Kira ate the backward-growing pomegranate, tasting sunlight that predated sorrow. <words>339</words> With each bite, the distant echo grew closer until it resonated in her bones: she was never truly orphaned, just temporarily misplaced in time's harsh arithmetic. <words>366</words>

The temple's vines reached through her pockets, depositing seeds where the brooch had been. <words>380</words> Tomorrow, another orphan would find them, theoretically random, and follow their own reversed pattern home. <words>395</words> Kira walked back toward the city, no longer streetwise but finally just wise, carrying the harvest of hope she'd pulled from darkness, ready to plant it wherever children still believed themselves alone. <words>427</words>

She would become the echo others followed home. <words>435</words>
