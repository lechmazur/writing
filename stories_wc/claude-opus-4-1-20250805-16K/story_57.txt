Lord Pemberton adjusted his gardening gloves while trimming the hedges surrounding the abandoned greenhouse—MI6's most peculiar secret agent workshop, where sound waves could liquify steel. <words>20</words> His submissive nature had always made him the perfect cover: who'd suspect an aristocrat content to prune roses while international espionage unfolded beneath his feet? <words>44</words> 

"Terribly sorry about the shears," he muttered to no one, though his unusually perceptive ears caught every vibration from the underground echo chambers below. <words>68</words> The workshop's acoustic experiments had created unintended listening posts throughout the garden, where trimmed hollows amplified classified conversations like nature's own surveillance system. <words>91</words> 

Today, something was different. <words>95</words> Through the soil's reverberations, Pemberton detected a tiny heartbeat—rapid, frightened, decidedly non-human. <words>108</words> A test subject, he realized with that peculiar silent empathy he'd cultivated through years of understanding without speaking. <words>126</words> 

"Oh blast, dropped my letter opener again," he announced cheerfully, kneeling to retrieve the deliberately dull blade he kept for such occasions. <words>148</words> The agents below never questioned his clumsiness; submissiveness invited dismissal, which suited him perfectly. <words>163</words> 

The conversations filtering up grew heated. <words>169</words> "Subject Seven's molecular cohesion destabilizes at forty kilohertz," someone said. <words>179</words> "Complete liquification within minutes." <words>183</words> 

Pemberton's fingers found the greenhouse's hidden frequency dial, disguised as a sprinkler timer. <words>196</words> His gift for perception extended beyond mere hearing—he understood resonance patterns like others understood words. <words>212</words> Subject Seven's heartbeat spoke volumes: a laboratory rabbit, perhaps, or something equally innocent. <words>226</words> 

"Frightfully warm today," he called down the ventilation shaft, his earnest tone masking swift calculations. <words>241</words> At thirty-nine kilohertz, he reasoned, the creature would experience paralysis but survive. <words>253</words> A merciful compromise. <words>256</words> 

His dull letter opener wedged perfectly into the dial's safety mechanism, preventing that final, fatal kilohertz. <words>272</words> Below, confusion erupted. <words>275</words> "System's locked at thirty-nine!" <words>279</words> 

"Technical difficulties, how delightfully British," Pemberton murmured, returning to his roses. <words>289</words> The rabbit's heartbeat steadied, frozen but alive. <words>296</words> Tomorrow, during routine maintenance, someone would discover the "malfunction" and release the creature. <words>309</words> They'd blame equipment failure, never suspecting the submissive aristocrat who spent his afternoons maintaining their cover story. <words>326</words>

He pocketed the letter opener, its dullness a deliberate mercy. <words>336</words> Sharp tools cut quickly, but blunt instruments taught patience—and patience, he'd learned, was how one saved lives without speaking a word. <words>358</words> The echo chambers below fell silent, but Pemberton's perception caught what others missed: a small, steady rhythm of survival, beating on. <words>380</words> 

"There's nothing quite like honest work," he told a passing butterfly, his flippancy genuine as earth beneath fingernails. <words>398</words> Silent empathy, after all, grew best in gardens where nobody thought to look. <words>411</words>
