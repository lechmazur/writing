The dry-tongued bard sat cross-legged beneath the phosphorescent gills of the giant mushroom meeting hall, her fingers tracing the edges of a stained glass prism she'd found buried in spore-dust. <words>27</words>

During the hush of this dreamless night, when even the fungal walls had ceased their gentle breathing, she felt the cloak of doubt settling heavier across her shoulders. <words>55</words>

Her voice had abandoned her three moons ago—not from illness, but from something deeper, a gorgeously awkward silence that bloomed whenever she tried to sing. <words>80</words>

The prism caught what little light filtered through the mushroom's translucent cap, fracturing it into colors that reminded her of the songs she used to weave. <words>106</words>

She reached for her communication device, an ancient thing that still captured voicemails from the world above. <words>123</words>

Forgotten messages lived there like preserved specimens—her mother's lullaby from five years past, a lover's whispered poem, her own voice practicing scales before the silence came. <words>150</words>

Each recording was a fragment of who she'd been, trapped in digital amber. <words>163</words>

The mushroom hall had become her refuge, its vast emptiness a perfect mirror to the hollow she carried. <words>181</words>

Yet tonight felt different. <words>185</words>

She held the prism to her throat, feeling its cool edges against her skin, and played her mother's voicemail through the device's tinny speaker. <words>210</words>

The words vibrated through the glass, through her flesh, creating new harmonics she'd never heard before. <words>227</words>

With crisp languor, she began assembling a choir of her preserved past—layering the forgotten voicemails, letting them echo through the cavernous space. <words>249</words>

Her lover's voice merged with her mother's, her own younger self harmonizing with both, the prism acting as conductor to this orchestra of memories. <words>274</words>

The cloak of doubt shifted, loosened. <words>280</words>

She wasn't escaping the prison of the self by running from it, but by acknowledging every version she'd ever been, gorgeously awkward in their collective imperfection. <words>306</words>

The mushroom walls began to hum in sympathy, their bioluminescence pulsing with each played message. <words>321</words>

Her dry tongue moved soundlessly, shaping words she couldn't speak but could finally feel. <words>336</words>

Through the night she sat, surrounded by voices that were and weren't hers, the stained glass prism refracting not just light but sound, memory, possibility. <words>362</words>

When dawn's first pale fingers touched the mushroom's crown, she discovered something profound—her voice hadn't left her. <words>380</words>

It had simply been waiting for her to understand that song could exist in the spaces between sounds, in the preservation of what was, and in the gentle acceptance of what is. <words>412</words>

The bard smiled, tongue still dry but heart finally wet with understanding. <words>424</words>
