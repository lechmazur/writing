Margot descended into the champagne vault beneath Paris, her pockets heavy with the stained-glass fragment she'd salvaged from Notre-Dame's ruins years ago. <words>18</words> The limestone cavern, transformed into an avant-garde venue, hosted the final performance of a molecular gastronomy exhibition—a science fair masquerading as haute cuisine. <words>40</words> She'd forgotten why she'd come until she spotted him: Dr. Chen, the biotechnologist whose engineered champagne yeast threatened to revolutionize—or obliterate—traditional French winemaking. <words>64</words>

"Ah, the urban forager," Chen said, his tone matching hers—that practiced indifference concealing fierce conviction. <words>79</words> "Still collecting fragments of dead culture?" <words>85</words>

Margot shrugged, though her fingers traced the glass shard's edges through worn fabric. <words>99</words> She'd encountered Chen three months prior at a sustainability science fair, where his presentation on synthetic fermentation had sparked protests from traditionalist vignerons. <words>122</words> Now, as opera singers performed amidst bubbling beakers and centrifuges, she understood the cultural clash wasn't merely scientific—it was existential. <words>142</words>

"Your yeast," she began, forgetting mid-sentence what she'd meant to say, then remembering with sudden clarity. <words>159</words> "The old champagne mothers in these caves—the original wild cultures that have lived here for centuries—your invention will kill them." <words>180</words>

Chen's expression softened imperceptibly. <words>184</words> "Progress demands sacrifice." <words>187</words>

"Does it?" <words>189</words> Margot produced the stained-glass fragment, its jeweled surface catching the vault's amber lighting. <words>203</words> "I found this after the fire, when everyone else saw only debris worth clearing." <words>218</words> She held it between them, this rescued piece of beauty. <words>229</words> "Some things deserve protection precisely because they're fragile." <words>237</words>

The soprano's voice soared through the ancient chambers as Margot began to negotiate, her charmingly scattered thoughts coalescing into unexpected eloquence. <words>258</words> "Give the traditional cultures sanctuary—just these caves, just this heritage." <words>269</words> She forgot Chen's first name, forgot the precise terms she'd rehearsed, but remembered what mattered. <words>285</words> "Your synthetic yeast can conquer the world above, but leave these wild mothers their underground kingdom." <words>302</words>

Chen studied the glass fragment, seeing in its rescued beauty what Margot saw in the microscopic cultures—irreplaceable wonders worth shielding from efficiency's march. <words>326</words> Around them, the performance reached its crescendo, tradition and innovation harmonizing in the limestone acoustics. <words>342</words>

"Three caves," he conceded finally. <words>347</words> "We'll preserve three caves of the original culture." <words>356</words>

Margot pocketed the glass, already forgetting the exact number but remembering the victory. <words>370</words> She drifted toward the exit with studied casualness, though inside she burned with quiet triumph. <words>386</words> The fragile wonder would survive, protected by her disinterested passion and a biotechnologist's reluctant grace. <words>401</words> Above ground, Paris continued its relentless transformation, but below, in these ancient vaults, something precious would endure. <words>418</words>
