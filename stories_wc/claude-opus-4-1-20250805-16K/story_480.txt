Marcus waited until the final chord faded from the abandoned music hall next door before slipping into the mess hall, his fingers already twitching to document nothing. <words>22</words> As a social media exorcist, he specialized in erasing digital ghosts—those viral moments people desperately wanted forgotten—but tonight, he hunted something different. <words>43</words> The mess hall stretched before him, tables overturned like digital profiles he'd scrubbed clean, and there, caught beneath a rusted bench leg, was an old grocery receipt. <words>70</words> 

He recognized the handwriting immediately, though he'd never met its owner—one of those familiar strangers whose shopping lists he'd been collecting for months. <words>93</words> Eggs, bread, bleach, birthday candles, rat poison—the combinations told stories that algorithms couldn't parse. <words>107</words> This particular receipt bore an address, inked in margins: "Tuesday midnights, behind Chen's Laundromat." <words>121</words>

Marcus moved through the city's capillaries, infiltrating secret clubs in alleyways where the digitally dead gathered. <words>137</words> These were people who'd hired him to erase their online selves, now meeting in spaces that smelled of wet concrete and whispered passwords. <words>161</words> Each club had its own rhythm—quietly loud in the way heartbeats sound deafening in silence. <words>177</words> 

At Chen's, he found her: Receipt Woman, as he'd named her in his collection. <words>191</words> She stood dealing tarot cards made from shopping lists, each item a prophecy of consumption. <words>207</words> "You're the exorcist," she said without looking up, her voice carrying that same quietly loud quality—soft words that crashed through consciousness. <words>229</words>

"I collect what remains," Marcus replied, producing her receipt. <words>238</words> 

She smiled, indifferent enthusiasm animating her features—the expression of someone who'd discovered life's punchline wasn't funny, just inevitable. <words>256</words> "We all leave traces. Even those you've erased." <words>264</words> She gestured to the gathered strangers, each one a client whose digital death he'd orchestrated. <words>279</words>

"Why gather here?" Marcus asked, his curiosity gnawing with life's raw edge. <words>291</words>

"To reignite," she said simply. <words>296</words> "Not online—that's your cemetery. But here, in forgotten spaces where receipts matter more than profiles." <words>312</words> She handed him a card: his own grocery list from three years ago, before he'd become an exorcist. <words>331</words> "You collected us before you knew us. Familiar strangers, feeding your curiosity." <words>343</words>

Marcus understood then—his archival obsession hadn't been random but preparation. <words>353</words> These people hadn't hired him to disappear; they'd recruited him to witness their analog resurrection. <words>369</words> The mess hall, the alleyway clubs, the receipts—all breadcrumbs leading to this moment where the digitally dead chose to reignite as something unnamed, untagged, gloriously invisible. <words>397</words>

He pocketed the receipt, joining their quietly loud revolution with the indifferent enthusiasm of someone who'd finally found home among familiar strangers. <words>420</words> The abandoned mess hall would remember what the internet forgot. <words>430</words>
