Markov had tended the particle acceleration garden for three centuries, watching quantum fruit trees bloom and decay in microsecond cycles while his nearly immortal body remained stubbornly constant. <words>24</words> The orchard keeper's bitter laughter echoed through the crystalline groves as he discovered what the Committee had done—they'd painted over the entire historical record of the garden's original ecosystem with their sanitized propaganda murals. <words>56</words>

His fingers, rigidly flexible from centuries of pruning probability branches, trembled as he held the single earbud cover he'd found buried beneath the oldest neutron-apple tree. <words>82</words> It was the last physical remnant of Dr. Sarah Chen, the garden's true creator, whose revolutionary work had been erased when the Committee decided her methods were too chaotic for their ordered vision. <words>115</words>

During his morning sketching—a ritual he'd maintained to document the garden's authentic patterns—Markov noticed something extraordinary. <words>131</words> The ink he'd accidentally spilled formed ephemeral patterns that matched Chen's original field equations, equations the Committee thought they'd destroyed. <words>152</words> The patterns flickered and shifted, revealing hidden frequencies that could launch a restoration sequence through the garden's quantum substrate. <words>172</words>

He laughed again, harsh and knowing, as he realized the Committee's greatest mistake. <words>186</words> They'd painted over history so thoroughly that they'd forgotten why Chen had designed the garden to be rigidly flexible in the first place—not as a contradiction, but as a survival mechanism. <words>218</words> The ecosystem could bend without breaking, adapt without losing its core identity, just like Markov himself had learned to do across his extended lifetime. <words>243</words>

Working through the ephemeral ink patterns, Markov began sketching the launch sequence with practiced precision. <words>258</words> Each stroke had to be perfect; the patterns would only remain visible for moments before the spilled ink dried and the quantum signatures dispersed. <words>283</words> The earbud cover served as his anchor point, its mundane plastic somehow retaining Chen's biometric signature after all these years. <words>304</words>

As the final pattern took shape, the painted murals throughout the garden began to crack and peel. <words>321</words> Beneath them, the true history emerged—not just Chen's work, but the collaborative effort of hundreds of scientists whose names had been erased. <words>344</words> The particle streams realigned, the quantum orchards shuddered, and slowly, impossibly, the original ecosystem began to restore itself from seeds hidden in probability loops. <words>369</words>

Markov's laughter turned genuine for the first time in decades as he watched butterflies made of living light return to pollinate the probability blossoms. <words>393</words> The Committee could paint over history, but they couldn't change the fundamental nature of a system designed to remember itself through chaos and time. <words>418</words> He pocketed Chen's earbud cover and returned to his sketching, documenting this new beginning with the bitter wisdom of someone who knew that history, like quantum fruit, always finds a way to ripen again. <words>451</words>
