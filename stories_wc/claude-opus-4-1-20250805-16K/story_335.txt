The mercenary's hands trembled as she pressed the amber chunk against the graffitied wall, its trapped spider catching the dying light that filtered through the collapsed cathedral's broken rose window. <words>24</words> Years of steady aim had abandoned her since Prague, since the child she'd failed to save, and now Rosa tracked ghosts through improbable rumor chains that led her here. <words>53</words>

"You're looking for the Weaver," a street artist had whispered in Barcelona, spray paint hissing against concrete. <words>70</words> "Try the old bishop who feeds pigeons in Munich." <words>80</words> The bishop had sent her to a fortune teller in Vienna, who'd spoken of a collapsed cathedral where artists gathered to paint over prayers. <words>104</words>

Rosa had learned to be carefully reckless with such breadcrumbs—rushing toward each lead while keeping one foot anchored in doubt. <words>124</words> The amber had been her father's, a soldier who'd returned from war with shaking hands and this strange trophy. <words>144</words> He'd claimed the spider inside was still alive, suspended between death and eternity. <words>158</words>

The cathedral's acoustics stretched each sound into an echoing hour, spray cans rattling like prayer beads, whispered conversations becoming confessions. <words>178</words> Rosa watched young artists transform broken saints into cosmic dancers, their paint breathing new life into dead stone. <words>197</words> She envied their ability to create rather than destroy. <words>206</words>

"The spider remembers," said a voice behind her. <words>214</words>

Rosa spun, hand reaching for a weapon she no longer carried. <words>226</words> An elderly woman stood there, paint-stained fingers extended toward the amber. <words>238</words> "Your father brought it back from the jungle wars, didn't he?" <words>250</words> "Thought if he could preserve one perfect moment of danger, he could master his fear." <words>266</words>

"How could you know that?" <words>271</words> Rosa's voice cracked like a teenager's. <words>278</words>

"Because I was the medic who couldn't stop his hands from shaking afterward." <words>291</words> The woman smiled sadly. <words>295</words> "We all search for the unknown path back to who we were before." <words>309</words>

Rosa felt the cathedral's broken beauty pressing against her chest—all these artists painting over sanctified walls, making peace with destruction through creation. <words>332</words> She understood now why the rumor chains had led her here, to this impossible moment where past and present collapsed together like the vaulted ceiling above. <words>359</words>

"I came to finalize something," Rosa said, extending the amber toward the woman who'd known her father's breaking. <words>378</words> "To let it go." <words>382</words>

The woman closed Rosa's fingers back around the amber. <words>391</words> "Keep it," she said. <words>395</words> "But paint something over it." <words>400</words> "Transform it." <words>402</words>

As the echoing hour faded into evening, Rosa picked up a can of gold spray paint, her shaking hands suddenly steady with purpose. <words>426</words> She began covering the amber with careful strokes, not hiding the spider but giving it wings, turning preservation into possibility. <words>447</words> Around her, the cathedral's newest congregation of artists nodded approval, understanding that sometimes the unknown we seek is simply permission to change what we've carried. <words>473</words>
