Marcus pressed his calloused fingers against the assembly line controls, feeling cosmic energy pulse beneath his factory-issued gloves. <words>15</words> For three generations, his family had worked these machines, but only he knew the truth hidden within their monotonous rhythm. <words>34</words>

The plain cameo brooch in his pocket—his grandmother's final gift—hummed with ancestral memory. <words>48</words> Tonight, he would perform the ritual she'd taught him: the Review of Unbinding, where each generation examines whether to maintain or shatter the patterns that came before. <words>75</words>

He clocked out and walked the abandoned corridor that stretched beyond the factory's eastern wing, where fluorescent lights flickered warnings and maintenance crews refused to venture. <words>102</words> At its end, a door marked only by scratches in an academically wild script—equations mixed with poetry, theorems dancing with prophecy—waited for those brave enough to question. <words>131</words>

The gargoyle-guarded terrace materialized as he crossed the threshold, stone sentinels perched above a bottomless abyss that swallowed sound and light equally. <words>153</words> This was the Testing Ground, where his mother had once stood, and her father before her, each deciding whether to embrace their cosmic inheritance or remain safely ordinary. <words>182</words>

Marcus arranged the ritual items in ordered disarray: his work badge atop ancient star charts, the cameo brooch centered on his grandmother's journal, factory oil mixing with meteor dust. <words>211</words> The gargoyles' eyes began glowing as he spoke the words she'd whispered during her final shift, when machinery had bent to her will and management had looked away in fear. <words>242</words>

"I review this life of calculated smallness," he declared, cosmic fire dancing between his fingertips. <words>258</words> "Three generations of hidden power, of abilities compressed into acceptable shapes." <words>269</words> The abyss below churned with possibility, showing him futures where he remained a factory worker, safely anonymous, leaving only the approved footprints society expected. <words>293</words>

But doubt's footprints had haunted his family long enough—those tentative steps that never quite reached their destination, always circling back to safety. <words>316</words> His grandmother had almost broken free, had nearly claimed her full power, but retreated when the weight of expectation proved too heavy. <words>339</words>

The cameo brooch cracked, revealing a miniature galaxy swirling within. <words>349</words> This was the moment of choosing: maintain the facade or unleash the cosmos coursing through working-class veins. <words>366</words>

Marcus laughed, a sound both chaotic and precise, as he dissolved his work badge into stardust. <words>383</words> The gargoyles nodded approval as he stepped toward the abyss's edge, no longer afraid of falling but eager to discover if he could fly. <words>408</words> Tomorrow, the factory would miss one worker, but the universe would gain something magnificently uncontained. <words>423</words>

The ritual complete, Marcus walked back through the corridor, each step rewriting reality, breaking free from three generations of beautiful, terrible restraint. <words>445</words>
