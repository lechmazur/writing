The sentinel crossed off the final name with theatrical deliberation, ink bleeding through yellowed paper like old blood. <words>16</words> "Certainly possible you're the last one who remembers," she muttered to the ghost swaying in the lighthouse keeper's bedroom, her dry wit intact despite three sleepless nights. <words>44</words>

The specter had been a keeper himself once, before the promises he'd made to passing ships began eroding like cliff faces beneath relentless waves. <words>69</words> Now he danced—always danced—the sailor's hornpipe in translucent bare feet, clutching a frayed piece of rope that had once secured everything he'd loved. <words>93</words>

"I need to learn the traditional methods," the sentinel said, watching him spin with reckless precision, each movement both wild and perfectly calculated. <words>117</words> "The old ways of keeping ships from rocks, before the automation, before the abandonment." <words>132</words>

The ghost paused mid-step, considering her with hollow eyes that still somehow sparkled. <words>146</words> "You know the hornpipe?" <words>150</words> His voice sounded like wind through broken glass. <words>158</words>

She did—her grandfather had taught her before the lighthouse service recruited her, before she'd learned that guarding abandoned beacons meant confronting what remained when duty died. <words>185</words> She rose from the moldering bed, matching his stance with muscle memory older than her cynicism. <words>202</words>

They danced together in the cramped bedroom, living and dead, their shared love for this specific maritime dance bridging the impossible gap between worlds. <words>227</words> With each synchronized step, he revealed secrets: how to read storms in seabird patterns, how to maintain the light when oil ran low, how promises to protect could become prisons. <words>258</words>

"The rope," she said between movements, eyeing the frayed hemp in his ghostly grip. <words>273</words> "You used it to lower supplies from the cliff." <words>282</words>

"And bodies," he whispered, "when the fever came and I couldn't leave my post." <words>296</words>

The list on the bed contained names of every soul he'd failed to save, promises broken by circumstance and time. <words>316</words> She understood now why she'd been sent to confiscate not just abandoned property but abandoned guilt. <words>333</words>

"Teach me everything," she demanded, dancing faster, her movements growing as recklessly precise as his. <words>349</words> "Before dawn erases you." <words>353</words>

He smiled—the first time in a century—and spun her through formations that encoded navigation secrets in their very steps. <words>373</words> The frayed rope dissolved between his fingers like sea foam, his burden finally witnessed, his knowledge finally passed on. <words>393</words>

By sunrise, she danced alone, but never again in ignorance. <words>404</words> The lighthouse stood empty of ghosts but full of purpose, its new sentinel armed with traditions that automation could never replicate. <words>426</words> She would keep different promises—ones that bent with storms rather than breaking, ones that honored the dead by protecting the living with reckless precision. <words>451</words>
