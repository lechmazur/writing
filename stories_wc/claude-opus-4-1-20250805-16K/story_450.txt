Marina's fingers traced the scorched NASA patch she'd sewn onto her leotard, a memento from her father's failed mission that everyone pretended had never launched. <words>22</words> The Thought Experiment Chamber hummed around her, its chrome walls reflecting infinite versions of herself preparing for the annual Kozlov family photo. <words>43</words>

"Is ready now?" she butted in broken English, her Russian accent thickening whenever she tried to speak his language. <words>62</words> Her brother Viktor sat in the chamber's central tub, surrounded by holographic bubbles that displayed alternate realities where their father had returned. <words>84</words>

Every year during Viktor's ritual bubble bath—the only time the chamber's probability matrices aligned properly—they recreated the last photo taken before the launch. <words>108</words> Marina would mimic their mother's final arabesque, frozen in that moment before everything changed, before denial became the family's native tongue. <words>129</words>

"The prophecy says when dancer speaks true, the lost returns," Viktor recited, adjusting the chamber's temporal settings. <words>146</words> Marina knew better than to believe grandmother's words, yet here she stood, sharp mind calculating the impossible angles of grief while her body held perfect form. <words>172</words>

"Papa is not coming," she said, the words feeling foreign and necessary. <words>184</words> The patch seemed to burn against her chest—evidence the government claimed never existed, debris from a "weather balloon." <words>202</words>

Viktor's bubbles showed a thousand variations: Papa stepping through the door, Papa's capsule landing safely, Papa never leaving. <words>219</words> But Marina saw what Viktor couldn't—how each scenario required them to keep playing this game, keep posing for photos with an empty space. <words>243</words>

"I dance his favorite," she attempted, her linguistic clumsiness somehow making the words more honest. <words>258</words> She began the routine he'd taught her before the mission, each movement a conversation with absence. <words>274</words>

The chamber's mechanisms whirred, calculating the probability of acceptance versus denial. <words>284</words> Marina's reflection multiplied across the walls, each version mimicking the next in an endless loop of inherited sorrow. <words>302</words>

"Is okay we stop pretending?" she asked, her grammar fracturing like their family had. <words>316</words> Viktor's hand reached for hers from the tub, soap bubbles clinging to his fingers like small, iridescent lies. <words>334</words>

The prophecy's twist wasn't that speaking truth would bring Papa back—it was that speaking truth would finally let him go. <words>355</words> Marina clutched the patch tighter, feeling its rough edges, its undeniable reality. <words>366</words>

"Take the photo," she said clearly, surprising herself with the sudden linguistic precision. <words>379</words> The chamber's camera clicked, capturing two siblings who'd finally stopped leaving space for ghosts. <words>394</words>

Outside the chamber, their mother waited with her own NASA patch hidden in her pocket, ready to join them in admitting what they'd always known. <words>419</words> The weight of denial, once lifted, left room for something else—not hope exactly, but permission to stop dancing around the truth. <words>441</words>

Marina held her final pose as the bubbles dissolved, each pop a small goodbye. <words>455</words> The prophecy was complete, though not as any of them had imagined. <words>467</words> Sometimes the lost return not in body, but in the courage to finally say they're gone. <words>483</words>
