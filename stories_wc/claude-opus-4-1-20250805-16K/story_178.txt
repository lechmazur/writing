The overburdened clerk clutched his vintage stamp collection as water pressed against the greenhouse dome above. <words>16</words> Three weeks ago, at the local trivia night, a marine biologist had asked an impossible question: "Which 1898 Mauritius stamp depicts a coral species that synthesizes compounds lethal to humans yet curative when properly quantized?" <words>50</words> Marcus had known the answer—not from memory, but because touching that exact stamp in his collection had always made reality shimmer. <words>72</words>

Now he stood in the undersea greenhouse on the coral plateau, breathing recycled air while his daughter lay dying above. <words>92</words> The trivia night encounter hadn't been chance; Dr. Reeves had been searching for someone who could weave between worlds. <words>111</words> "Time is absolutely relative here," she'd explained, gesturing at the bioluminescent coral swaying beyond the glass. <words>128</words> "What takes years above happens in the ephemeral pause of a breath below." <words>141</words>

Marcus opened his album to the Mauritius page, fingers trembling with dissonant calm—terror wrapped in necessary focus. <words>158</words> Each stamp was a doorway, but only one led to the cure. <words>170</words> The coral here grew in patterns that matched the perforations exactly, nature's own attempt to quantize infinity into comprehensible segments. <words>190</words>

He pressed his thumb to the blue two-penny stamp. <words>199</words> Reality folded. <words>201</words> The greenhouse became translucent, overlapping with another version where the coral glowed differently, where the disease had never evolved. <words>220</words> He could see both worlds simultaneously—his burden as a clerk had been cataloging not mail, but possibilities. <words>237</words>

Dr. Reeves watched him work, harvesting polyps from the space between dimensions. <words>249</words> "Your daughter's cells will accept these because they're from a world where her DNA already contains the resistance," she murmured. <words>269</words> The stamps weren't just pictures; they were coordinates, each one marking where realities touched. <words>283</words>

As Marcus selected the final polyp, he felt the weight of his revelation. <words>296</words> Years of sorting mail, organizing correspondence between strangers, had been preparation for this—threading the needle between worlds to deliver hope. <words>316</words> The greenhouse shuddered as pressures equalized between dimensions. <words>324</words>

He sealed the sample container, watching the coral's poison transform into medicine through the lens of parallel existence. <words>342</words> In that moment between breaths, between worlds, he understood why the collection had chosen him. <words>357</words> Every stamp he'd ever touched had been practice for this quantum sorting, this ultimate delivery. <words>372</words>

The water outside turned gold as sunrise reached the plateau. <words>382</words> Time resumed its normal flow. <words>387</words> Marcus held the cure, extracted from the infinite library of what could be, finally understanding that his burden had always been a gift waiting for its purpose. <words>415</words>
