Marina's dice clicked against the rustic candle mold she'd repurposed as a cup, the irony not lost on her as she waited at the abandoned tidal power monitoring station. <words>24</words> Every Thursday during what the locals called "candlelit dinners," she'd dock her leaking boat here, pretending to monitor gauges that hadn't worked since the grid collapsed. <words>50</words>

The unspoken bargains had started three months ago. <words>58</words> Professor Hendrik would arrive past midnight, wild-eyed and trembling, clutching stolen university equipment. <words>71</words> She'd bet him odds on which turbine would spin fastest when the tide turned, and he'd lecture her about entropy, chaos theory, and the mathematics of desperation. <words>98</words> Neither acknowledged what they really traded: her dwindling rations for his fading knowledge, both trying to capture one last spark before oblivion claimed everything. <words>122</words>

"You're early," Hendrik wheezed, materializing from shadows. <words>129</words> His rebellious midnight lectures had cost him tenure, then freedom, now possibly his mind. <words>143</words> Marina laughed, tears streaming as she always did these days—the body's confused response to a world gone rarely predictable. <words>162</words>

"The tide charts lied again," she said, shaking the candle mold. <words>173</words> "Bet you can't explain that with your theories." <words>182</words>

He sat heavily beside her, pulling out a genuine beeswax candle—worth a month's food. <words>197</words> "Tonight's lecture: probability collapse in closed systems." <words>204</words> His hands shook as he lit it. <words>211</words> "When observers become participants, when the house always wins becomes meaningless because there is no house." <words>227</words>

Marina had been naive once, believing luck could be courted, controlled. <words>238</words> Now she understood their game differently. <words>244</words> Each bet, each lecture, each Thursday dinner by candlelight was really about something else entirely. <words>259</words> The professor needed someone to remember his brilliance. <words>267</words> She needed someone to witness her still trying. <words>275</words>

"Double or nothing," she proposed, watching wax drip into the mold's ancient grooves. <words>288</words> "Your next lecture for my last tin of peaches." <words>298</words>

"What's the wager?" <words>301</words>

"That tomorrow the sun rises." <words>306</words>

Hendrik's laughter matched hers—tears and mirth inseparable. <words>313</words> "Terrible odds," he said. <words>317</words> "The data suggests—" <words>320</words>

"Take the bet, Professor." <words>324</words> She pushed the dice toward him. <words>330</words> "While we still can pretend it matters." <words>337</words>

Outside, the turbines groaned against impossible tides, their rhythm rarely predictable since the moon's orbit had shifted. <words>354</words> But inside their makeshift casino-classroom, two souls wagered everything on nothing, teaching and learning, betting and losing, capturing sparks in rustic candle molds while the darkness pressed against their windows. <words>384</words>

He rolled the dice. <words>388</words> They clattered, bounced, settled. <words>392</words> Neither looked at the numbers. <words>397</words>

"Lecture seventeen," he began, voice growing stronger. <words>404</words> "On the mathematics of hope in entropic systems." <words>412</words>

Marina closed her eyes, crying and laughing, memorizing every word before the candle burned out. <words>427</words>
