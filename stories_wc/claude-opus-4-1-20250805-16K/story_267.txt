The mild-tempered guard at Horizon's Edge Black Hole Resort pedaled his maintenance bike through the gravitational corridors, where reality itself seemed to fray like an unraveling thread. <words>27</words> Each morning shift began the same: following the resort's engineered stray cats through the service alleyways, their quantum-entangled collars leading him to dimensional breaches that needed sealing. <words>53</words> Today, a tabby named Void led him deeper than usual, past the tourist sectors where wealthy visitors experienced controlled event-horizon meditation, into the forgotten industrial wing. <words>79</words> There, inexplicably, stood an ancient blacksmith's anvil, its iron surface rippling with tidal forces that shouldn't exist this far from the singularity. <words>101</words> The guard dismounted his bike, approaching with the poetically bland curiosity that made him perfect for this job—neither heroic nor villainous, just methodically competent. <words>125</words> He'd refused promotion three times, content to exist between the false dichotomy of savior and threat that the resort's management constantly imposed on their security staff. <words>151</words> The anvil hummed with a frequency that made his teeth ache with savage bliss, that peculiar euphoria that came from proximity to controlled annihilation. <words>175</words> Another cat appeared, this one wearing what looked like a disguise—a holographic collar projecting the image of a small dog, glitching between forms. <words>198</words> The guard laughed, a sound swallowed immediately by the gravity well's acoustic dampening field. <words>212</words> He understood now: the cats weren't leading him to problems but away from them, creating a careful dance of misdirection. <words>232</words> The anvil was a gravitational anchor, illegally installed by someone to stabilize unauthorized time-tourism pods that management pretended didn't exist. <words>252</words> Following his feline guides had become his own disguise, a way to patrol without seeming to patrol, to protect without being labeled protector. <words>275</words> He touched the anvil's surface, feeling the universe's fabric bunch and smooth beneath his fingers like silk thread pulling loose from its weave. <words>299</words> The sensation was intoxicating—this proximity to absolute destruction wrapped in the mundane wrapper of a minimum-wage job. <words>316</words> Tomorrow he would bike these same routes, follow these same cats, maintain this same delicate balance between order and entropy. <words>336</words> The resort's brochures promised guests an encounter with the infinite, but the guard knew better: infinity was found in the repetition of small, necessary tasks performed at the edge of oblivion. <words>368</words> He remounted his bike, leaving the anvil undisturbed, its presence now part of his rounds' unspoken inventory. <words>385</words> The cats dispersed through the alleyways, their job complete until tomorrow's gentle conspiracy would begin again. <words>401</words> Behind him, the black hole spun in its cage of exotic matter, neither friend nor foe, simply the savage, blissful truth around which everything else pretended to matter. <words>430</words>
