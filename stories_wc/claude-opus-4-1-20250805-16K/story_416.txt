Sir Aldric's armor clinked as he waded through the luminous swamp, its bioluminescent algae casting green shadows across his determined face. <words>19</words> The championship archery match had ended badly—scoreboard wiped clean after a dispute about enchanted arrows—but he'd overheard something more intriguing. <words>39</words> A merchant whispered about the Spiral Prophet, an urban legend claiming a fossilized snail shell could reveal where destinies converged. <words>59</words>

Aldric had always been the kingdom's most dutiful knight, following every protocol, until he'd started secretly collecting these street myths. <words>79</words> His academically rebellious streak emerged during mandatory tactics lectures, where he'd sketch folklore maps instead of battle formations. <words>97</words> The other knights never suspected their most decorated brother-in-arms maintained detailed journals of tavern tales and marketplace superstitions. <words>115</words>

The swamp's glow intensified near the ancient library ruins, half-submerged but still operating. <words>128</words> Inside, phosphorescent moss illuminated crooked shelves. <words>134</words> He spotted it immediately—a perfect spiral fossil, alone on a high shelf. <words>147</words>

His gauntleted hand reached up. <words>152</words>

Another hand appeared. <words>155</words>

They collided, metal against leather, both grasping for the same prize. <words>166</words>

"Pardon," Aldric said curtly, then looked down. <words>173</words>

A swamp witch, young, with calculating eyes. <words>180</words>

"You're after the Prophet," she stated. <words>186</words>

"Just browsing." <words>188</words>

She snorted. <words>190</words> "Knights don't browse in cursed libraries." <words>196</words>

They stood frozen, both still reaching. <words>202</words>

"I need to verify something," Aldric admitted. <words>209</words> "About converging paths." <words>212</words>

"Whose?" <words>213</words>

"Mine and my brother's." <words>217</words> His jaw tightened. <words>220</words> "He vanished chasing the same legends I secretly document." <words>229</words>

The witch's grip loosened slightly. <words>234</words> "I seek my sister." <words>238</words> Her voice carried unexpected warmth. <words>243</words> "She followed a knight into these swamps, investigating old stories." <words>253</words>

Their eyes met. <words>256</words>

Understanding struck like lightning. <words>260</words>

"When?" they asked simultaneously. <words>264</words>

"Three moons past," both answered. <words>269</words>

The fossil seemed to pulse between their touching hands. <words>278</words>

"The shell shows where destinies converge," she whispered. <words>286</words> "Perhaps it already has." <words>290</words>

Aldric's disciplined facade cracked into something resembling a grin. <words>299</words> "Your sister—did she study astronomy?" <words>305</words>

"Obsessively." <words>306</words>

"My brother taught himself star navigation from forbidden texts." <words>315</words>

They lowered their hands together, cradling the fossil between them. <words>325</words> Its surface shimmered, revealing a map in the shell's spiral—two paths weaving toward a single point deeper in the swamp. <words>345</words>

"Partners?" the witch proposed. <words>349</words>

"Obviously." <words>350</words>

They left the library with matching strides, the straight-laced knight and the pragmatic witch, both driven by love disguised as curiosity. <words>371</words> The luminous swamp welcomed them like an old friend sharing secrets. <words>382</words> Behind them, the empty shelf waited for the next seekers whose destinies demanded convergence. <words>396</words> Some urban legends, Aldric realized with quiet joy, were simply prophecies waiting to be verified. <words>411</words>
