The groggy brewer stumbled through the haunted mansion graveyard, his head pounding from last night's experimental batch. <words>15</words> He'd been testing a new recipe when the protest began—something about preserving the old brewery district from demolition. <words>32</words> Now, during the lull when voices gathered again for another surge, he found himself inexplicably drawn to the crumbling mausoleum. <words>52</words>

"Uniquely generic," he muttered, examining the structure's predictably Gothic arches and utterly unremarkable gargoyles. <words>66</words> It was precisely its aggressive normalcy that made it stand out among the genuinely ancient graves. <words>82</words> His grandfather had always said brewing was about becoming a living embodiment of one's values—patience, precision, tradition. <words>99</words> But what values did this place embody? <words>106</words>

The piece of broken mirror caught his eye, wedged between two weathered stones. <words>119</words> As he bent to retrieve it, his reflection fractured across its surface—one eye here, half a mouth there. <words>138</words> "Well, that's unnecessarily metaphorical," he said aloud, his flippant tone masking genuine unease. <words>150</words>

The encroaching darkness wasn't subtle. <words>155</words> It crept from the mansion's basement windows like spilled stout, pooling in the courtyard's corners. <words>170</words> The protesters' distant chants grew muffled, as if someone had thrown a heavy blanket over the world. <words>187</words>

He noticed it then—the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase leading down into what must have been the mansion's wine cellar. <words>209</words> Or perhaps its brewing cellar, he thought with bitter irony. <words>219</words> The stain was barely visible, a shade darker than the surrounding grime, but it pulsed with intent. <words>236</words>

"Right then," he sighed, pocketing the mirror shard. <words>244</words> "Time to initiate whatever cosmic nonsense this is." <words>252</words> His grandfather would have walked away, but his grandfather hadn't spent thirty years perfecting ales only to watch the district become luxury condos. <words>276</words>

Each step down the staircase brought deeper shadow, thicker silence. <words>286</words> The mirror fragment grew warm in his pocket, and he understood with the clarity of fermentation science that this darkness wasn't destroying—it was transforming. <words>310</words> Like yeast converting sugar to alcohol, it was changing the very nature of things. <words>324</words>

At the bottom, he found an ancient brewing setup, copper kettles green with age. <words>338</words> The darkness swirled through them like living liquid. <words>346</words> "Of course," he laughed, the sound both mocking and reverent. <words>356</words> "Even the supernatural can't escape gentrification." <words>362</words>

He lifted the mirror shard, watching the darkness refract through it, splitting into something he could work with. <words>379</words> If he was going to embody his values, he'd do it his way—one careful brew at a time, even if the ingredient was darkness itself. <words>404</words> The protesters above resumed their chant, and he began his work. <words>415</words>
