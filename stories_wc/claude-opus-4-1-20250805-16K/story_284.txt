Marcus, the pirate radio operator known only as "Frequency" to his underground listeners, maintained his stoic composure even as the band stopped playing at the corner bar below his cramped broadcast booth. <words>29</words> His show had just ended with its usual sign-off—"Stay untamed, stay sincere"—delivered in the ironically earnest tone that his devoted audience mistook for wisdom rather than the pompous humility it truly was. <words>60</words> 

Descending the fire escape, he discovered a leather wallet wedged between rusted bars. <words>73</words> The ID inside pointed to an address he recognized: the old beekeeper's sanctuary on Miller Road, where hexagonal hives stood like ancient monuments to patience. <words>98</words> Marcus prided himself on returning lost things—it was his peculiar way of navigating uncharted emotional depths without actually connecting with people. <words>118</words>

The sanctuary gate stood open beneath a canopy of linden trees. <words>129</words> A woman in a mesh veil worked among the hives, her movements deliberate and graceful. <words>145</words> "Your wallet," Marcus announced, extending it with practiced detachment. <words>154</words>

She turned, lifting her veil to reveal eyes that sparkled with unexpected recognition. <words>167</words> "Frequency?" she gasped. <words>170</words> "I listen every night—your voice keeps me company while I tend the late swarms." <words>185</words>

Marcus felt his carefully constructed walls tremble. <words>192</words> From the wallet, she pulled out a folded paper plane, worn soft from handling. <words>207</words> "I made this during your first broadcast, three years ago," she said, her untamed sincerity cutting through his defenses like radio waves through static. <words>232</words> "You spoke about loneliness being a frequency we all tune into." <words>243</words>

She unfolded the plane, revealing words written in fading ink: "For the voice in the dark—thank you for being real." <words>263</words> 

Marcus studied the creases, each fold a decision, each angle an intention. <words>275</words> "I'm not real," he said, his pompous humility suddenly feeling hollow. <words>286</words> "I'm just noise on unauthorized frequencies." <words>292</words>

"That's what makes you real," she replied, refolding the plane with practiced precision. <words>305</words> "Your trying not to be." <words>310</words> She pressed it into his palm. <words>316</words> "The bees understand frequency too—they dance their directions, navigate by vibration." <words>327</words> Her hand lingered on his. <words>332</words> "Sometimes the most honest broadcasts are the ones that aren't supposed to exist." <words>345</words>

Marcus looked at the paper plane, then at her face framed by golden afternoon light filtering through honeycomb. <words>363</words> For the first time in years, his stoic mask cracked. <words>373</words> "Would you..." he began, then stopped, started again with untamed sincerity, "Would you like to co-host tomorrow's show?" <words>391</words>

She smiled, adjusting her veil. <words>396</words> "Only if we can broadcast from here, among the hives." <words>406</words>

Marcus nodded, clutching the paper plane—his first real connection, delivered by chance, received with grace. <words>421</words> The bees hummed around them, a natural frequency that needed no permission to exist. <words>435</words>
