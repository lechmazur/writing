The steampunk observatory dome housed many strange tenants, but none more virtually peculiar than Silas "Verses" Blackwood, an outlaw cowboy poet who'd traded his six-shooter for stanzas. <words>27</words> He sat in the observatory's copper-piped coffee shop, rolling his worn runic bone dice across the mahogany table while watching the walls display their ever-shifting text. <words>53</words> Throughout rehearsals for the astronomical society's annual performance, he'd noticed how the words on those walls seemed to predict futures—not just any futures, but intertwined destinies that bound strangers together like cosmic thread. <words>86</words>

Tonight's rehearsal felt different. <words>90</words> The dice clattered, showing symbols that shouldn't exist on ancient bone, while the wall's text flickered: "When stars misalign, truth speaks." <words>110</words> Silas frowned, his weathered fingers tracing the dice's impossible engravings. <words>120</words> He'd stolen these from a dying shaman in Tucson, back when he still rode with the Crimson Canyon gang, back before poetry saved him—or condemned him, depending on the day. <words>150</words>

The coffee shop walls pulsed with new messages, steam from brass pipes obscuring then revealing words that made patrons question everything. <words>171</words> "Your performance tonight will spark unstoppable curiosity in the astronomer's daughter," appeared briefly before dissolving into "But curiosity killed more than cats." <words>194</words>

Silas felt that familiar weight of saturated ambivalence—half anticipation, half dread—that had defined his existence since abandoning the outlaw life. <words>214</words> Was redemption real, or just another performance? <words>221</words> The dice seemed warm in his palm, their runes glowing faintly green against the observatory's gaslight ambiance. <words>237</words>

During dress rehearsal, as he recited verses about desert moons and steam-powered dreams, he watched the astronomer's daughter in the audience. <words>257</words> Her eyes held questions that the changing wall-text had predicted, questions that would either doom or deliver them both. <words>276</words> The bone dice in his pocket hummed with ancient energy, and suddenly Silas understood: the walls didn't predict fate—they revealed how deeply every destiny was already woven together. <words>304</words>

He deliberately began to misalign his practiced verses, improvising new lines that made the observatory dome itself seem to breathe and shift. <words>326</words> The audience leaned forward, captivated by this unexpected deviation. <words>335</words> The astronomer's daughter stood, her curiosity ignited like phosphorus meeting air. <words>346</words> 

The coffee shop walls, visible through the dome's glass panels, displayed one final message: "Some outlaws steal gold; others steal wonder." <words>367</words> Silas smiled, knowing his greatest heist was just beginning—not of wealth or freedom, but of imagination itself. <words>384</words> The dice rolled themselves in his pocket, their runes spelling out a future where poetry and stars conspired to crack open minds like safes, revealing treasures no vault could hold. <words>414</words>
