Beneath the cobblestone streets where children played hopscotch, their laughter echoing through storm drains, lived Mirin the necromancer. <words>17</words> She dwelt in the goblin city of Underholm, where phosphorescent moss painted everything in gentle green light. <words>33</words> Unlike her peers who commanded death with iron fists, Mirin spoke to spirits in whispers, apologizing each time she disturbed their rest. <words>55</words>

The universal riddle had consumed her for decades: why did life and death form such a tangled tapestry, each thread impossible to follow without unraveling the whole? <words>82</words> Every goblin child above knew the answer instinctively—she could hear it in their playground songs—but adults forgot, and the dead couldn't quite remember. <words>106</words>

Her fountain pen, its nib broken from years of frantic note-taking, lay useless beside her grimoire. <words>123</words> She'd documented ten thousand conversations with spirits, yet the riddle remained locked. <words>135</words> The goblins, peculiarly sincere creatures who couldn't lie even about their thievery, had told her the truth: "You're looking too hard, surface-dweller." <words>158</words>

One morning, as water dripped from the cavern ceiling, Mirin noticed something extraordinary. <words>171</words> A single dewdrop had formed on a spider's web, catching the faint light from above where children played. <words>190</words> Within that tiny sphere, she saw the entire underground city reflected—distorted, inverted, but complete. <words>205</words> The tangled tapestry of tunnels, the living and the dead, the goblin merchants and human visitors, all contained in one trembling bead of water. <words>229</words>

She understood then, with mystic simplicity that made her laugh at her own complexity. <words>243</words> Life and death weren't separate threads to untangle but the same strand viewed from different angles, like the city in the dewdrop—whole, perfect, inevitable. <words>268</words>

Mirin picked up her broken fountain pen, and for the first time in years, it wrote smoothly. <words>285</words> The damaged nib, catching ink at just the right angle, created letters more beautiful than when it was whole. <words>304</words> She began to regain not just her understanding but her purpose. <words>315</words>

"Thank you," she whispered to the spider, to the dewdrop, to the laughing children above. <words>330</words> The goblins gathered around her, their large eyes reflecting the same phosphorescent green, waiting with their peculiar sincerity for her to share what she'd learned. <words>355</words>

"The riddle has no answer because it is the answer," she told them gently. <words>369</words> "We are all dewdrops, containing everything while being almost nothing, beautiful in our brevity." <words>383</words>

Above them, the playground sounds continued—swings creaking, children calling, life persisting in its ancient rhythm. <words>398</words> Below, Mirin smiled, her broken pen writing perfect truths, finally understanding that some tapestries are meant to remain tangled, their beauty lying not in their individual threads but in their glorious, impossible whole. <words>431</words>
