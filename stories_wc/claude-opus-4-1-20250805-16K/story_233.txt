Elena clutched the marble fragment—a child's stone hand reaching upward—as her laptop screen flickered to life in the secret society's treasure vault. <words>19</words> The other summoners appeared as peculiarly virtual avatars, their true forms hidden behind pixelated masks that shimmered between commercials of the streaming service they'd hijacked for these rumor-charged midnight gatherings. <words>50</words> 

She was the youngest here, the most naive, still believing that magic was about grand gestures rather than whispered truths. <words>70</words> The broken statue piece had been her grandmother's, torn from some ancient guardian that once protected those who understood the old songs. <words>92</words> Now, surrounded by dusty relics and glowing screens, Elena pressed the fragment against her chest and began to hum. <words>111</words>

"Louder," urged Marcus, his avatar a shifting constellation of stars. <words>121</words> "Fate doesn't hear timid voices." <words>126</words>

The lullaby her grandmother taught her rose through the vault's shadows, each note trying to elevate beyond the physical walls, beyond the digital barriers, reaching for something infinite. <words>154</words> The other summoners joined through their microphones, creating a chorus that existed neither fully here nor there, but in that peculiar space between real and virtual where modern magic thrived. <words>184</words>

Elena didn't understand yet how the seeds of understanding were already sprouting within her. <words>198</words> Each gathering taught her fragments—how belief could buffer between commercial breaks, how ancient powers adapted to wifi signals, how treasure vaults became server rooms for souls. <words>224</words> The broken statue piece grew warm in her palm, responding to voices from six different time zones united in purpose. <words>244</words>

"I can feel it," she whispered, interrupting her humming. <words>253</words> The marble fragment projected ghostly images: the complete statue, a child offering songs to the sky, surrounded by believers who understood that fate wasn't distant but simply waiting for the right frequency. <words>285</words>

Marcus's avatar flickered approvingly. <words>289</words> "The naive ones always learn fastest," he said with distant warmth, remembering his own awakening. <words>304</words> "They don't know what's impossible." <words>309</words>

As the next commercial break approached, threatening to sever their connection, Elena hummed louder, desperately, purely. <words>325</words> The broken piece pulsed with sympathy, teaching her what the others already knew: every summoner starts naive, clutching fragments of greater wholes, singing to unhearing skies. <words>350</words> But through these midnight gatherings, through shared songs and digital fellowship, understanding germinated slowly, surely. <words>365</words>

The screen went dark as advertisements invaded their sacred space. <words>375</words> But Elena's voice continued in the treasure vault, her lullaby echoing off ancient artifacts and modern monitors alike, a bridge between worlds. <words>397</words> She finally understood—fate had been listening all along, waiting for her naive heart to elevate simple humming into something eternal, something that could heal even broken statues, one gathered voice at a time. <words>430</words>
