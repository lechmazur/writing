The spirited lumberjack Marlene dismounted her rusted bicycle outside *L'Ossaire*, the ancient ossuary turned gourmet restaurant where bone-white columns still bore scratch marks from desperate fingernails. <words>24</words>

She'd been cycling here nightly since discovering the coded letter from a future war tucked beneath her dying grandmother's pillow—a document describing healing traditions that could prevent catastrophic plagues, written in timber-marking symbols only a lumberjack would recognize. <words>65</words>

Inside, Chef Baptiste greeted her with harsh tenderness, his scarred hands gracefully awkward as he guided her past diners unknowingly eating above thousands of skulls. <words>91</words>

"The nightmares have returned," Marlene whispered, knowing Baptiste's hidden agenda aligned with hers—he'd lost his daughter to the same mysterious illness spreading through the logging camps. <words>118</words>

He nodded, leading her through the kitchen's steam to a concealed stone stairway. <words>131</words>

"Each bike ride here, I decode more," she said, producing the letter's latest translation. <words>146</words>

"The future warns of bioweapons hidden in imported timber, but also describes how medieval plague doctors here once used ossuary minerals to create immunity." <words>171</words>

Baptiste's eyes darkened. <words>174</words>

"My grandmother knew—she worked these forests, saw the first sick trees arrive last spring." <words>189</words>

They descended into the ossuary's untouched depths, where ancient healing symbols matched those in Marlene's letter perfectly. <words>206</words>

"We must revamp everything," Baptiste said, his voice echoing off walls lined with tibias. <words>221</words>

"Convert the restaurant into a treatment center without alerting whoever's behind this." <words>233</words>

Marlene touched a skull, feeling its strange warmth. <words>241</words>

"The letter says the nightmares are part of it—a psychic warning system reawakened when the pathogen nears." <words>258</words>

"That's why sensitive people like us dream of burning forests and bleeding earth." <words>271</words>

Over weeks of midnight bike rides, they smuggled equipment piece by piece, transforming the restaurant's wine cellar into a laboratory while maintaining the dining room's elegant facade. <words>298</words>

Marlene's gracefully awkward manner—stumbling through fancy dining rooms while possessing surgeon-steady hands with a chainsaw—made her the perfect spy. <words>318</words>

Nobody suspected the flannel-clad woman who knocked over wine glasses yet could identify diseased wood from fifty yards. <words>336</words>

The nightmares intensified, showing her glimpses of the war the letter described—biological devastation, forests weaponized, millions dying. <words>353</words>

But also hope: knowledge passed through time, hidden in plain sight within a lumberjack's calloused hands and a chef's broken heart. <words>375</words>

Together, they prepared the ossuary's ancient remedies, grinding bones that had survived plagues centuries past, following instructions bridging future and past. <words>397</words>

The harsh tenderness of their mission—saving lives while serving haute cuisine above humanity's remains—sustained them through exhaustion and fear. <words>417</words>

When the first sick loggers arrived, guided by Marlene's carefully spread rumors, the true work began. <words>433</words>

Each healing broke another fragment of the conspiracy, each recovery a small victory against tomorrow's war. <words>449</words>

The ossuary's dead, patient in their alcoves, seemed to whisper approval as life triumphed in their presence. <words>466</words>

Marlene's bicycle leaned against ancient stone, waiting for the next midnight ride between worlds. <words>480</words>
