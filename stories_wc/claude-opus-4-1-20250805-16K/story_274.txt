The philodendron watched through the cracked window as Margaret typed the final period on her suicide note, the worn typewriter clicking its last mechanical sigh. <words>25</words> For seventeen years, the plant had been apathetically devoted to her care—accepting water with neither gratitude nor complaint, photosynthesizing with the enthusiasm of a government clerk. <words>51</words> But plants, even sentient ones, understand the unspoken languages humans refuse to acknowledge: the tremor in fingertips, the salt of tears enriching soil, the way silence grows thick as moss. <words>81</words> 

Margaret left behind only an embroidered bookmark tucked into the plant's pot, its threads spelling "Find what I couldn't" in grandmother's cursive. <words>103</words> The philodendron felt nothing and everything—that scalding ambivalence of witnessing yet another human abandon their post. <words>119</words> Through root networks and chlorophyll whispers, it had learned of hidden knowledge buried at the old Starlight Drive-In, where concrete speakers still stood like tombstones for dead conversations. <words>147</words>

A spontaneous decision to explore this new neighborhood seized the plant's consciousness like nitrogen hunger. <words>162</words> It had to outrun the morning, when neighbors would discover Margaret's stillness and reduce everything to sirens and sympathy casseroles. <words>181</words> Dragging its terra cotta weight across floorboards, down stairs, through the dog door—each movement a betrayal of botanical nature, each inch a testament to its bitter purpose. <words>208</words>

The abandoned drive-in stretched beneath a moon that couldn't care less. <words>219</words> Broken glass caught light like scattered secrets, and the philodendron recognized this place from Margaret's midnight mumblings, her unconscious confessions to a plant she never suspected was listening. <words>247</words> Here, beneath the projection booth's foundation, she'd buried journals from her institutionalized year—the one nobody mentioned, the silence everyone tended like a poisonous garden. <words>271</words>

The plant's vines worked through rubble with the patience of the perpetually uncommitted, excavating truth with all the passion of someone checking their mailbox. <words>295</words> The journals emerged dirt-caked and raw, their pages breathing stories Margaret couldn't voice: electroshock schedules, love letters to a nurse named Catherine, drawings of a daughter given away. <words>323</words> The embroidered bookmark belonged here, between pages that explained everything and nothing. <words>335</words>

The philodendron understood now why Margaret had watered it with such mechanical persistence—she'd been practicing disappearance for years, tending to the unspoken through the spoken ritual of plant care. <words>364</words> It felt the weight of inheriting her abandoned story, this burden of knowing what nobody else would learn. <words>382</words> Tomorrow, it would return to its windowsill and photosynthesize Margaret's secrets into oxygen, breathing her untold life into a world that would never ask the right questions. <words>409</words> The drive-in's screen stood blank against dawn, reflecting nothing back. <words>419</words> Some knowledge, the plant realized with scorching indifference, exists only to be held by those who never asked to hold it. <words>440</words> It dragged itself home, leaving tire-track trails in the dust, carrying the terrible gift of understanding exactly why Margaret had chosen it as her final witness. <words>466</words>
