Marcus Chen lived in the utility closet beneath the Andromeda Nebula Observation Deck, selling contraband memories to tourists who'd forgotten why they came. <words>19</words> His broken zipper pull—a brass moth frozen mid-flight—served as his shop sign, dangling from the ventilation grate that marked his territory. <words>40</words>

The station's folklore claimed that anyone who stared into the nebula would receive visions of their predetermined future, a corporate-sponsored prophecy that kept the viewing tickets at premium prices. <words>69</words> Marcus had analyzed these stories for seven years, finding the contradiction that would become his liberation: every "vision" matched the exact template printed in the station's welcome brochure from 2387. <words>98</words>

"Your future awaits," he'd whisper to passing visitors, his voice carrying the impersonally personal cadence of someone who'd memorized your diary but never learned your name. <words>124</words> They'd stop, these seekers of cosmic truth, drawn by his peculiar gravity. <words>136</words>

He'd show them the broken zipper pull, explaining how it once sealed a spacesuit belonging to Elena Voss, the first person to see the nebula without the station's filtering glass. <words>166</words> "She saw nothing," Marcus would intone with absurd solemnity, "and in that nothing, she found everything the station didn't want her to see." <words>189</words>

The tourists would lean closer as he propagated his truth through carefully planted doubts. <words>203</words> Why did all prophecies involve promotion to middle management? <words>212</words> Why did every cosmic vision include the same brand of synthesized coffee? <words>224</words>

Across the hush of unspoken promises—those moments when visitors realized their expensive enlightenment was mass-produced—Marcus would offer an alternative. <words>243</words> For half the price of a viewing ticket, he'd disable their neural filters for seventeen seconds. <words>259</words> Just long enough to see the nebula raw, unprocessed, magnificent in its refusal to mean anything at all. <words>276</words>

Station security knew about Marcus, of course. <words>283</words> But his side hustle served their purposes; every rebellion needs a safety valve, and his clients always returned to their predetermined lives, carrying only the faintest memory of genuine wonder. <words>313</words>

Still, Marcus persisted in his mission to forge new paths through the cosmos of conformity. <words>328</words> Each night, after the observation deck closed, he'd press his face against the ventilation grate, staring at the nebula through the gaps in metal and protocol. <words>355</words> The broken zipper pull would catch the stellar light, casting moth-shadows that danced like possibilities across his closet walls. <words>374</words>

He was teaching the universe to remember itself, one contradicted prophecy at a time. <words>388</words> And in the space between what the station sold and what the nebula was, Marcus had found his own vision: a future unzipped from expectation, beautiful in its refusal to close. <words>419</words>
