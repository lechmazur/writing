The herbalist slouched against the glass wall of the observatory, too drained to care that she'd missed another tide measurement. <words>16</words> Her notebooks lay scattered across the floor, filled with meticulous observations she'd stopped believing mattered. <words>30</words> Outside, waves crashed against the cliff with mathematical precision she once would have cherished. <words>44</words>

She'd brought the blacksmith's bellows here three months ago, convinced its rhythmic pumping could simulate the ocean's breathing patterns during her afternoon naps. <words>68</words> Such thoughtfully thoughtless preparation—installing equipment for experiments she'd abandon halfway through, driven by a fervent indifference that consumed her more each day. <words>91</words> The price of perfection, she'd learned, was discovering that nothing you perfect actually matters. <words>105</words>

A lone goose traced its path across the observatory's ceiling, its shadow sliding over her closed eyelids. <words>122</words> She tracked its flight without opening her eyes, a skill developed during countless hours pretending to sleep while monitoring the tides. <words>144</words> The goose always flew the same route at 2:47 PM, banking left where the cliff met sky, then disappearing beyond her glass prison. <words>168</words>

She'd come here to study tide patterns, believing their secrets would unlock some grand botanical truth about coastal herbs' medicinal properties. <words>190</words> Now she understood the tides simply were—neither caring for her theories nor needing her documentation. <words>206</words> The bellows wheezed in the corner, its leather lungs matching her breathing as she dozed. <words>222</words>

In her half-dreams, she cherished this failure. <words>230</words> Not with bitter irony, but with the peculiar warmth of someone who'd pursued excellence so relentlessly that exhaustion had become a friend. <words>253</words> She'd measured every wave height, timed every surge, correlated each movement with the moon's pull. <words>269</words> Perfect data sets lined her shelves, useless as pressed flowers. <words>279</words>

The goose's shadow crossed her face again—impossible, since it never circled back. <words>291</words> She opened one eye. <words>295</words> The bird hovered outside the glass, wings beating against wind currents she'd never bothered to map. <words>311</words> It clutched something in its talons: a sprig of samphire, the coastal herb that had started her obsession. <words>329</words>

She laughed, a sound rusty from disuse. <words>337</words> The universe's joke was elegant—she'd ignored the actual plants while perfecting her study of their environment. <words>354</words> The goose released the samphire, and it tumbled down the cliff face toward the waves. <words>370</words>

Rising required enormous effort, but she managed it, shuffling to the bellows. <words>382</words> She pumped it once, twice, watching the tide retreat with each compression. <words>395</words> Correlation without causation—the refuge of the thoughtfully thoughtless. <words>403</words> Outside, the goose disappeared into fog, leaving her alone with her perfect, pointless sanctuary. <words>417</words> She returned to her nap, dreaming of tides that moved without her permission, cherishing their indifference as much as her own. <words>439</words>
