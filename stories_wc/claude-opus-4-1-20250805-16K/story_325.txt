Dr. Margot Thornweather adjusted her worn-out leather belt, the only thing keeping her specimen jars from tumbling down the mountain as she entered the Himalayan tea house at 14,000 feet. <words>27</words> The establishment's projector flickered during intermission, casting shadows that made her carnivorous plants writhe in their containers with unusual vigor. <words>46</words>

"The film reel," she announced to the startled patrons with comically serious intensity, "contains hidden sections that ionize the atmosphere." <words>66</words> The tea house owner, Pemba, who'd been her guide yesterday and her adversary today—such was the nature of fickle loyalty at these altitudes—merely shrugged. <words>90</words>

Margot had tracked the unexplained phenomena here: Venus flytraps growing wild above the tree line, pitcher plants thriving in frozen soil. <words>110</words> The ancient pathways she sought weren't mountain trails but electromagnetic corridors that her predecessors had mapped onto celluloid, frame by frame. <words>131</words>

"Your plants are eating my yaks' dreams," Pemba said flatly, pouring butter tea. <words>144</words> "Yesterday you promised they only ate insects." <words>151</words>

"Dreams emit specific ions when disrupted," Margot replied, examining the projector with scholarly fervor. <words>165</words> "My plants have evolved to detect them." <words>172</words> She threaded the film backward, revealing reversed images of botanical expeditions from 1923. <words>184</words> Between frames 447 and 448, she found it: a splice containing magnetized silver particles arranged in patterns matching the underground root systems she'd mapped. <words>207</words>

The tea house trembled. <words>211</words> Outside, aurora borealis shouldn't exist at this latitude, yet green fire danced across the peaks. <words>226</words> Her carnivorous plants began singing—not metaphorically, but producing actual harmonics through their modified stomata. <words>240</words>

"You're mad," Pemba declared, though he helped her steady the projector. <words>251</words> His loyalty shifted like mountain weather; he'd sell her secrets to competing botanists tomorrow, but tonight, witnessing the impossible, he was hers. <words>273</words>

The hidden sections in the black-and-white film reel weren't just maps—they were activation keys. <words>288</words> Each frame, when ionized by the projector's lamp at precisely this altitude, opened dormant pathways that connected the Earth's botanical nervous system. <words>311</words> Ancient monks had discovered this, encoding their knowledge in entertainment, hiding truth in plain sight. <words>326</words>

Margot's pitcher plant suddenly bloomed, revealing teeth that shouldn't exist in any taxonomy. <words>339</words> "The pathways are opening," she whispered reverently. <words>346</words> Through the tea house windows, impossible gardens materialized on barren peaks, carnivorous and magnificent, fed by dreams and starlight. <words>365</words>

Pemba poured another tea, his hands steady despite everything. <words>374</words> "Tomorrow, I'll deny this happened," he said. <words>381</words>

"Tomorrow," Margot smiled, tightening her worn belt around her expedition coat, "these plants will have already changed everything we thought we knew about evolution." <words>405</words> The film reel clicked to its end, but the pathways remained open, pulsing with ancient, hungry life. <words>422</words>
