The delicate warrior known as Moth stepped through the mysterious swamp filled with fireflies, their light painting her scarred face in fleeting gold. <words>18</words> She carried pressed seaweed in her satchel—the last evidence of a coastal village that had laughed itself to death three winters ago. <words>39</words> The fate of a secret hung between her teeth like bitter medicine: she had been the one to poison their wells with euphoria spores, believing joy could cure their plague. <words>69</words>

"Refreshingly cynical," the marsh witch had called her when they'd met at dawn. <words>82</words> "You incorporate death into life's tapestry with such gentle fingers." <words>92</words>

Moth touched the corroded cameo on a lost pocket watch chain hanging from her belt—inside, a portrait of her sister smiled with eyes that had never learned to weep. <words>122</words> The watch had stopped at midnight, at the end of a line nobody wants to cross, when laughter became screaming became silence. <words>145</words>

The fireflies pulsed in peaceful frenzy around her, nature's heartbeat made visible. <words>157</words> She understood their dance now—chaos wearing tranquility's mask, or perhaps the reverse. <words>170</words>

Her motivation had always been pure: to sow laughter in fields of despair. <words>183</words> The war-torn provinces needed hope, needed something beyond their daily rations of grief. <words>197</words> She'd studied under jesters and plague doctors alike, learning that the membrane between healing and harming was rice-paper thin. <words>216</words>

In the swamp's embrace, she knelt beside a pool that reflected nothing. <words>229</words> The pressed seaweed crumbled between her fingers as she sprinkled it into the water, each fragment a memory of children giggling while drowning in their own mirth. <words>257</words>

"I know you're listening," she whispered to the thing that lived beneath. <words>269</words> "The secret dies with me tonight." <words>275</words>

Bubbles rose, carrying whispers: "Your sister's cameo holds more than her image." <words>287</words>

Moth unclasped the corroded cameo carefully. <words>293</words> Behind her sister's portrait lay another pressed seaweed specimen—this one shimming with natural phosphorescence, untainted by her failed alchemy. <words>312</words> Her sister had known. <words>316</words> Had prepared an antidote before Moth's experiment ever began. <words>325</words>

The fireflies descended, forming words in the air: "She saved one village. Far north. They remember laughter without madness." <words>345</words>

Tears came then, the first in three winters. <words>353</words> The delicate warrior collapsed into the moss, her armor of cynicism cracking like old leather. <words>368</words> The peaceful frenzy of the swamp cradled her—predator and protector, witness and judge. <words>381</words>

She would go north. <words>385</words> She would find those who laughed without dying. <words>393</words> She would learn her sister's true secret: how to balance joy's blade so it healed without cutting too deep. <words>413</words>

The fireflies wrote one last message: "Delicate warriors break beautifully." <words>423</words>

Moth stood, incorporating this truth into her bones. <words>431</words> The swamp released her with a sigh that sounded almost like laughter—real laughter, the kind that knew sorrow's shape but chose to dance anyway. <words>456</words>
