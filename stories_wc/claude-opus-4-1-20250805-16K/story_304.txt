The baroque asteroid's gilded corridors curved like the pattern of a spider's web after rain, each junction gleaming with moisture from the atmospheric processors. <words>19</words> Katarina pressed her paint-splattered camera lens against the observation window, watching the transport bus complete its final route through the mining district far below. <words>42</words> The bus driver, unaware he carried her target, navigated the unforgiving road that spiraled through the asteroid's hollow core—a path carved by forgotten architects who believed their ornate designs were superficially profound statements about humanity's reach. <words>78</words>

She had been lurking for three cycles, learning the rhythms of this impossible place where baroque fountains sprouted from zero-gravity chambers and crystal chandeliers floated like frozen fireworks. <words>106</words> The assassination wasn't about credits or revenge; she needed to cradle the dawn in trembling hands, to steal the coded sunrise program her target carried—the only key to freeing her daughter from endless night on Europa Station. <words>143</words>

The paint on her lens wasn't decorative but functional, each splatter precisely placed to refract light into false images, creating blind spots in the surveillance network. <words>169</words> She'd studied how raindrops clung to spider silk, how they bent light into prisms, and replicated that geometry across the lens surface with thermochromic paint that shifted with her body heat. <words>200</words>

The bus descended through the carved marble tunnel, its headlights cutting through artificial mist like borrowed starlight—pale echoes of real suns that none here would see again. <words>227</words> Katarina moved through service passages, her footsteps silent on velvet-covered grating, past cherub statues whose eyes housed security cameras she'd already looped with yesterday's footage. <words>252</words>

When the bus reached the terminal's baroque plaza, where golden pillars twisted toward a painted ceiling depicting false constellations, she positioned herself behind a fountain of liquid mercury. <words>280</words> Her target emerged, briefcase magnetized to his wrist, unaware that his bodyguard had been replaced three stops ago. <words>297</words>

The moment arrived like a held breath releasing. <words>305</words> Katarina's blade found its mark with surgical precision, but as her target fell, he looked up through her paint-splattered lens and began to laugh—not with malice but with genuine mirth. <words>336</words>

"The dawn you seek," he gasped, pressing the briefcase release, "was always yours to take. I've been waiting for someone desperate enough to use it correctly." <words>363</words> Blood pooled across marble cut to resemble frozen waves. <words>372</words> "Your daughter sends her love through the dark." <words>380</words>

Katarina's hands trembled as she opened the case, finding not codes but a child's drawing—her daughter's drawing—of a sunrise painted in the same splatters that decorated her lens. <words>408</words> The unforgiving road had led her here, through borrowed starlight and baroque emptiness, only to discover that mercy sometimes wears an assassin's face, and dawn comes to those who've traveled through enough darkness to recognize its value. <words>446</words>
