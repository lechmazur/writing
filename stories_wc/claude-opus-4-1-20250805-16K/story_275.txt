The hermit arrived at the ghostly orchard as the comet began its arc across the sky, her wagon wheels crushing dead apple leaves beneath. <words>24</words> Throughout moving from one withered grove to the next, she'd carried her pressed flower album—pages filled with specimens from lands where things still grew. <words>49</words> The orchard's previous inhabitants had fled when the comet first appeared, believing its tail poisoned the soil, but she recognized a different truth in its burning trajectory. <words>77</words>

Her theoretically rebellious notion was simple: the comet wasn't killing the earth but speaking to it in angles only the desperate could translate. <words>101</words> She positioned her half-bent weathervane precisely where the old farmhouse foundation met scorched grass, adjusting its crooked arrow until it caught the comet's light at forty-seven degrees. <words>129</words> This exact angle, she'd discovered, revealed patterns in the shadows that corresponded to the pressed flowers in her album—each specimen a cipher for regeneration. <words>154</words>

The other hermits she'd encountered called her methods madness, but mindful choices had always guided her through the deliberate wilderness of dying places. <words>178</words> She opened the album to a page of pressed moonflowers, their ghostly petals matching the spectral apple blossoms that still clung to skeletal branches. <words>203</words> As the weathervane's shadow moved with the comet's passage, she traced its path across the barren ground, planting seeds at each intersection point. <words>227</words>

Throughout moving between the rows, she noticed how the comet's heat warmed soil that had been cold for three winters. <words>248</words> The weathervane creaked, bending further in the cosmic wind, changing the shadow-pattern's meaning from "wait" to "now." <words>266</words> She understood this translation instantly—the pressed flowers weren't just memories but promises, each one marking where life had triumphed before. <words>287</words>

By dawn, as the comet reached its zenith, thin green shoots emerged where she'd planted according to the weathervane's decoded message. <words>309</words> The ghostly orchard shimmered with possibility, its dead trees suddenly scaffolding for new growth rather than monuments to failure. <words>329</words> She pressed a fresh apple blossom between the album's pages, adding to her collection of proofs that rebellion against barrenness wasn't theoretical but practical. <words>354</words> 

The weathervane, now bent nearly horizontal, pointed toward the next dead place she would visit. <words>370</words> Throughout moving forward, she would carry this knowledge: that comets brought not death but transformation, readable only through the precise angles of broken things willing to translate celestial fire into earthbound hope. <words>403</words> Her wagon rolled on, leaving behind an orchard learning to breathe again, its ghost becoming flesh through her deliberate, mindful choices. <words>425</words>
