The blacksmith's fingers traced botanical drawings etched into grimy arcade walls, their delicate ferns and orchids obviously subtle against the neon-soaked concrete. <words>18</words> Between acts at the underground fight ring, when blood was mopped and bets collected, Kaine worked his true craft. <words>36</words> Not the neural-enhanced weapons he forged for street samurai, but something older, wilder. <words>50</words>

He studied how dust motes swirled beneath the arcade's single skylight, mapping their patterns with the patience of a cartographer charting undiscovered continents. <words>73</words> Each particle danced according to invisible currents, revealing pathways that the city's architects never intended. <words>89</words> These were the cracks where fantasy could take root. <words>98</words>

"You're wasting time again," Chen said, her chrome fingers drumming against a defunct pachinko machine. <words>114</words> "The next match starts in twenty." <words>120</words>

Kaine didn't look up from his work. <words>127</words> "Time isn't wasted when you're reclaiming what they stole." <words>136</words> His voice carried that drifting arrogance of someone who'd discovered a secret everyone else was too blind to see. <words>156</words>

The botanical drawings weren't decoration—they were instructions. <words>163</words> Each vine he'd etched showed where nature once thrived before concrete smothered everything. <words>176</words> The dust motes weren't random; they followed ancient wind patterns from when this place was forest. <words>193</words>

He pulled out his plasma torch, modified with components no corporation would approve. <words>207</words> Where others saw a weapon, Kaine saw potential to kindle something forgotten. <words>219</words> The torch's flame bent strangely, following the dust-mapped currents. <words>229</words>

"What are you—" Chen started, then stopped. <words>236</words>

Green shoots pushed through microscopic cracks in the floor, following the botanical drawings' guidance like sheet music for growth. <words>255</words> They grew with impossible speed, fed by the plasma torch's recalibrated energy and guided by patterns older than the city itself. <words>277</words>

The arcade's patrons, jacked on stims and neural feeds, barely noticed at first. <words>291</words> But as vines crept across broken screens and flowers bloomed from abandoned terminals, even the most augmented stopped to stare. <words>312</words>

This was Kaine's rebellion—not destroying the system, but weaving something untamed through its rigid structures. <words>328</words> Every botanical drawing was a memory, every kindled flame a resurrection. <words>339</words> The wild didn't need to overthrow the city; it just needed someone to show it the cracks. <words>357</words>

Chen watched moss spread across her chrome fingers, and for once, didn't brush it away. <words>373</words> "The authorities will shut this down." <words>380</words>

"Let them try," Kaine said, his wistful smile reflecting in the skylight's dusty beam. <words>395</words> "They can't unwild what remembers being free." <words>403</words>

The bell rang for the next match, but nobody moved toward the ring. <words>417</words> They were too busy watching a blacksmith teach a dying city how to bloom. <words>432</words>
