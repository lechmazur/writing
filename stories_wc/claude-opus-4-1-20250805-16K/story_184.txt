Margot wiped down the vacuum chamber garden's observation window with the same practiced indifference she'd once reserved for sticky tavern tables. <words>17</words> The seashells behind the glass—her grandmother's collection, now fractured into a thousand memories—floated in antigravity suspension, their broken edges catching starlight. <words>40</words>

"Predictably unpredictable," she muttered, watching the temporal field reverse another hour. <words>51</words> The sands of time flowed backward here, where Earth's last botanical sanctuary defied entropy through sheer technological stubbornness. <words>69</words> She'd tried to escape this calling—scrubbing floors at the Nebula's End tavern, pretending her genetic markers didn't scream "chrono-botanist" to every scanner. <words>91</words>

But destiny, like spilled beer, always found its level. <words>100</words>

The fossilized footprints appeared first in the observation deck's floor—impossible impressions from a dried-up riverbed that existed sixty million years ago, yet somehow bled through the station's temporal shielding. <words>128</words> Margot traced them with her boot, feeling the pull of ancient water, extinct creatures, possibilities that existed before humanity dreamed of stars. <words>150</words>

"Computer, randomize the growth patterns," she commanded with mock gravity. <words>160</words> "Let's catapult imagination beyond known realms, shall we?" <words>168</words>

The AI complied, shuffling DNA sequences like a cosmic card dealer. <words>179</words> Inside the vacuum chamber, impossible orchids began sprouting from the broken shells, their petals unfurling in reverse-bloom, dying into seeds that would never exist. <words>204</words> Each fragment of her grandmother's collection became a node in this temporal rebellion—barnacles growing backward into larvae, conch spirals unwinding into mathematical equations. <words>228</words>

She remembered Gran's last words: "Some inheritances choose you, girl." <words>238</words> Back then, Margot had laughed, poured another round, ignored the way plants bent toward her like drunks toward gossip. <words>257</words>

Now, watching time-reversed ferns write tomorrow's history in yesterday's soil, she understood. <words>269</words> The footprints in the floor weren't leading backward but forward—through time's looking glass where cause followed effect and gardens grew in airless void. <words>293</words>

A notification blinked: another tavern-hand position available on Mining Station Seven. <words>304</words> Margot deleted it without reading, her fingers already adjusting the temporal flow controls. <words>318</words> The shells continued their broken dance, each shard a universe of possibility, each crack a doorway to when the Earth still held rivers. <words>342</words>

"Inescapable," she said to the reversing roses, to the fossilized footprints, to the grandmother who'd hidden prophecy in seashells. <words>361</words> "But who's escaping?" <words>364</words>

She pressed her palm against the chamber glass, feeling the vacuum's hunger, the plants' impossible breathing, time's backward river flowing through her veins. <words>388</words> Tomorrow, she'd discover yesterday's seeds. <words>393</words> Yesterday, she'd plant tomorrow's extinction. <words>398</words> And somewhere between, in this flippantly solemn dance of destiny and defiance, a scrappy tavern-hand would tend the universe's most impossible garden. <words>421</words>
