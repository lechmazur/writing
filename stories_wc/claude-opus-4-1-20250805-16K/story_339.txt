Marina stood at the edge of the prismatic lake, where rainbow oil slicks from the construction machinery transformed the water into a mirror of impossible colors. <words>24</words> The abandoned amusement park behind her was being demolished, piece by piece, its skeleton exposed amid the construction chaos that had consumed her childhood sanctuary. <words>48</words> She clutched the simple drawer knob in her pocket—brass, unremarkable, except it was all that remained from her dressing room after the fire. <words>71</words> 

Twenty years ago, she'd been the star of this lakeside attraction, a modestly extravagant venue that drew families from three counties with its promise of wonder. <words>97</words> Now, as a joyless performer who still went through the motions at corporate events, she'd returned to organize what was left of her past. <words>121</words> The echo of a squeaking seesaw in the empty playground drifted across the water, its rhythm matching the pendulum of her indecision. <words>143</words>

She was torn between truths: the official report that blamed faulty wiring, and what she alone knew—that she'd left a candle burning that night. <words>168</words> Her partner had died in that fire. <words>175</words> The investigators never found the candle; she'd hidden it, wrapped in her costume, thrown into this very lake. <words>193</words> The guilt had transformed her from a radiant entertainer into someone who merely inhabited the stage, going through memorized movements without soul. <words>215</words>

The construction foreman had called her yesterday—they'd started dredging the lake. <words>226</words> Soon they would find what she'd hidden, or they wouldn't, and either outcome terrified her. <words>241</words> She pulled out the drawer knob, remembering how she'd unscrewed it moments before the flames reached her door, a futile attempt to save something beautiful. <words>266</words> 

The seesaw's squeak continued, though no child played there—just wind and rust creating a phantom melody. <words>283</words> With cautious abandon, she walked to the water's edge where oil rainbows swirled like liquid stained glass. <words>300</words> She could confess now, organize the chaos of two decades of performance, or let the construction bury everything deeper. <words>319</words> 

The drawer knob felt warm in her hand, its simple weight anchoring her to both versions of the truth. <words>338</words> She thought of all the children who'd laughed here, all the joy she'd once created before it burned away. <words>357</words> The prismatic water reflected her face in fragments—performer, liar, survivor, ghost. <words>368</words> 

Marina threw the knob into the lake with all her strength, watching it disappear into the rainbow depths. <words>386</words> Tomorrow the dredgers would find it, or they wouldn't. <words>395</words> But today, she would finally stop performing her innocence and organize the truth that had kept her joyless for so long. <words>416</words> The seesaw fell silent, as if waiting for her confession. <words>426</words> She pulled out her phone and dialed the number she'd memorized but never called—the fire investigator who'd never quite believed her story. <words>448</words>
