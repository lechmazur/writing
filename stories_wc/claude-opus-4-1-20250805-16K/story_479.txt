Margot Delacroix, the internet's most glamorous undertaker, adjusted her pearl necklace while scrolling through her grandmother's archived Facebook posts from 2009. <words>21</words> The brass measuring tape—passed down from her great-great-grandmother Céleste, the first mortician in their lineage—gleamed beside her laptop as she searched for evidence of the family's secret ritual. <words>50</words> 

"The myth of ordinariness," Céleste had written in a status update nobody had liked, "is believing death arrives without celebration." <words>70</words> Margot laughed with jubilant remorse, remembering how she'd once dismissed these posts as an old woman's ramblings. <words>87</words> Now, mixing cerulean and gold paint in her workshop while livestreaming to preserve ancient practices, she understood everything. <words>105</words>

The tradition was exquisite in its strangeness: before each burial, the family's undertakers would elongate the deceased's measurements by exactly three inches using the brass tape, recording a body larger than life itself. <words>137</words> This wasn't deception—it was poetry. <words>142</words> Céleste believed that death expanded rather than diminished us, that our stories stretched beyond physical boundaries. <words>158</words>

Margot had been fruitlessly patient for years, searching these digital archives for the ritual's origin while her followers begged for conventional makeup tutorials. <words>182</words> They wanted contouring tips; she gave them philosophy wrapped in Chanel No. 5 and formaldehyde. <words>197</words> During paint mixing—her meditation hour when pigments swirled like souls—she'd discovered Céleste's final post. <words>212</words>

"My darling descendants," it read, "ordinary death is the cruelest lie we tell ourselves." <words>226</words> Attached was a sepia photograph: Céleste holding the brass measuring tape beside a coffin painted in impossible colors, blues that sang and golds that wept. <words>251</words>

Margot's eyes filled with tears of recognition. <words>258</words> She understood now why she'd always felt compelled to document everything online, transforming her mortuary into a digital monument. <words>277</words> Each archived post, photo, and video elongated the presence of the departed, stretching their existence across servers and screens worldwide. <words>297</words>

She lifted the brass measuring tape, its weight familiar as DNA. <words>308</words> Tomorrow she would bury Mrs. Chen, and the measurements would be precisely three inches longer than truth. <words>325</words> She would mix paints in colors that didn't exist in nature, streaming the entire process to her million followers. <words>344</words> They would witness the transformation of grief into art, of endings into infinite beginnings. <words>358</words>

"Ordinary is the only death that's truly final," Margot typed into her status update, tagging her grandmother's ghost profile with jubilant remorse. <words>381</words> The notification would never be read, but somewhere in the vast social network archive, Céleste's digital spirit would smile, knowing the tradition lived on, beautifully and impossibly elongated. <words>409</words>
