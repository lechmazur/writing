Brother Cornelius pressed the plain metal bottle cap between his trembling fingers, its ridged edges cutting crescents into his palm as he studied the Sanskrit texts by candlelight. <words>23</words> The Victorian parlor, inexplicably transported brick by brick to the Amazonian depths, creaked against the pressing jungle humidity while vines strangled the mahogany shutters. <words>47</words>

"The unspoken agreements between man and divine," he muttered, his eyes wild with exhaustion, "they're all here, hidden in the theoretically playful arrangements of these ancient syllables." <words>74</words> Outside, howler monkeys shrieked their evening prayers, and Cornelius knew—with the certainty only zealots possess—that they too understood the contract. <words>94</words>

Lady Pemberton had commissioned this parlor's reconstruction after her husband's expedition disappeared, believing proper British décor might tame the wilderness. <words>114</words> Instead, the jungle had made it its shrine. <words>122</words> Cornelius had arrived three months ago, claiming divine visions led him here, though the servants whispered he'd simply followed the beetles that nested in his beard. <words>149</words>

The bottle cap—found beneath the ottoman that morning—had triggered his latest revelation. <words>161</words> Someone had drunk modern soda in this timeless space, proving that reality itself bent here like light through water. <words>180</words> He pressed it harder, feeling its industrial perfection mock the handwritten mysteries before him. <words>195</words>

"I must uproot everything," he declared to the empty room, though empty was relative when wallpaper grew eyes after midnight. <words>215</words> The studying had shown him patterns: how Victorian propriety and jungle law had merged into something neither civilization nor nature intended. <words>236</words>

Margaret, the housemaid, entered carrying tea that steamed like souls escaping purgatory. <words>248</words> In the darkness between bookshelf and wall, where shadows grew thick as tar, Cornelius pulled her close. <words>265</words>

"I'm terrified," he whispered, his confession dissolving his carefully constructed madness. <words>276</words> "The texts speak of surrendering control, but I've spent my whole life grasping for it through faith, through fury, through this absurd certainty that God speaks directly to me." <words>306</words> His fingers uncurled, releasing the bottle cap, which rolled across Persian rugs being slowly digested by moss. <words>323</words>

Margaret touched his face with fingers that smelled of silver polish and jungle rot. <words>338</words> "Perhaps your strength isn't in the grasping, Brother." <words>346</words>

The parlor's grandfather clock, which hadn't worked since arrival, suddenly chimed thirteen times. <words>359</words> Cornelius laughed—a sound like furniture breaking—and realized the cosmic joke: his zealotry had been armor against the beautiful terror of simply not knowing. <words>383</words> The bottle cap gleamed on the floor, a perfect circle of manufactured certainty in a world that had abolished such concepts. <words>405</words>

He returned to his studies with new eyes, seeing the texts not as puzzles to conquer but as invitations to dance with mystery. <words>429</words> The jungle pressed closer, and the Victorian parlor sighed its acceptance. <words>440</words> Some agreements, Cornelius finally understood, remain unspoken precisely because words would diminish their terrible, wonderful truth. <words>456</words>
