The orchard island drifted through the maelstrom's eye, its apple trees swaying with unnatural grace as Midwife Vera stood before the abandoned cottage's fireplace. <words>20</words> She had always been critical of the old ways, questioning every tradition passed down through generations of healers, yet here she stood, drawn by whispers of stolen memories. <words>48</words> The waxing moon's glow filtered through broken windows, illuminating half-burned diaries scattered among the ashes—pages she recognized as her own handwriting, though she had no memory of writing them. <words>77</words>

With practiced fingers that had delivered countless infants into this strange world, she lifted the charred remains, finding pressed herbs between the surviving pages: feverfew, rosemary, forget-me-not. <words>104</words> Each plant released its ancient scent, triggering fragments of knowledge she hadn't known she possessed. <words>120</words> The cottage belonged to her, she realized, though the realization came wrapped in that peculiar dissonant calm that had settled over the island since the maelstrom began. <words>147</words>

She was openly secretive about her work here—everyone knew she came to the cottage, yet no one questioned what transpired within. <words>169</words> The burned diaries revealed why: she had been documenting the island's transformation, how the orchard had torn itself from the mainland when the first memories were stolen. <words>197</words> Her critical nature had made her the perfect witness, questioning everything even as she recorded it faithfully. <words>214</words>

"To transcend is to remember," she read from a partially intact page, the words written in an ink made from crushed apple blossoms and sage. <words>240</words> The pressed herbs weren't mere decorations but ingredients for a remedy she had been developing—not to heal bodies, but to recover what the maelstrom had taken. <words>267</words> Each diary entry showed her growing wisdom, her understanding that the island's drift wasn't random but purposeful, seeking something beyond the spiral of forgetting. <words>291</words>

Under the waxing moon, she began mixing the pressed herbs with ash from her own burned memories, creating a paste that glowed faintly silver. <words>316</words> As she worked, more memories surfaced: delivering her own child on this island, watching it fade like morning mist, understanding that some losses teach us how to find. <words>345</words> The maelstrom wasn't destroying—it was sorting, separating those who could transcend forgetting from those who would drown in it. <words>364</words>

She applied the paste to her temples, and the cottage filled with the sound of remembered laughter, forgotten names, stolen moments returning like birds to their roost. <words>392</words> The critical midwife had delivered herself at last, not into new life but into recovered wholeness, her openly secretive work complete as the island continued its eternal drift through the swirling chaos, carrying its cargo of growing wisdom home. <words>432</words>
