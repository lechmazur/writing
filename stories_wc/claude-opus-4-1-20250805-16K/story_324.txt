The advisor's fingers trembled as she stood before the glass cylinder, its contents floating in synthetic fluid—a brain labeled simply "DUPLICATE" in fading ink. <words>21</words> In the hush of a simmering future where consciousness could be copied but never truly understood, Dr. Elena Marsh served as the most insecure advisor the secret agent headquarters had ever retained. <words>52</words> 

The rumor had consumed her for months: somewhere in the abandoned west wing, the original Dreamer still lived. <words>70</words> Not the body—that had been cremated years ago—but the calling itself, that clearly ambiguous phenomenon that allowed certain minds to slip between realities while sleeping. <words>96</words> Elena had chased this rumor beyond all reason, abandoning her duties, her reputation crumbling like the headquarters' forgotten corridors. <words>115</words>

She jabbed the activation sequence into the dusty terminal. <words>124</words> The brain in its jar pulsed once, bioluminescent threads firing in patterns she'd memorized from classified files. <words>141</words> This wasn't just any duplicate; it was her own, harvested during her recruitment when the agency still believed she might manifest the Dreamer's calling. <words>166</words>

Through the echo of footsteps in the abandoned place—her own, bouncing off metal walls that hadn't heard human presence in a decade—she felt it beginning. <words>192</words> The sound multiplied, fractured, became a rhythm that matched neither her gait nor her heartbeat. <words>207</words> The headquarters had been a paradise once, agents and advisors working in perfect synchronization, but that fractured idyll had shattered when the first Dreamer died mid-transit between worlds. <words>237</words>

"You're not supposed to be here," her duplicate's thoughts whispered through the neural interface, surprisingly coherent for preserved tissue. <words>256</words> 

Elena laughed, bitter and sharp. <words>261</words> "I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be." <words>269</words> Her insecurity had always been her strength—while confident agents charged forward, she questioned everything, especially the agency's insistence that the Dreamer's calling couldn't be artificially induced. <words>296</words>

The jar's fluid began to bubble. <words>302</words> Her duplicate brain was dreaming now, synapses firing in impossible cascades. <words>313</words> Elena felt the pull, that clearly ambiguous sensation of being both utterly present and completely elsewhere. <words>329</words> The abandoned wing transformed around her—walls became permeable suggestions, time stretched like taffy. <words>343</words>

She understood now why they'd labeled it duplicate rather than copy or backup. <words>356</words> It wasn't mere replication; it was iteration, each version reaching deeper into the dream realm than the last. <words>374</words> The rumor had been true, but incomplete—the Dreamer hadn't died but dispersed, leaving echoes in every preserved consciousness stored in these forgotten vaults. <words>399</words>

Elena's last coherent thought, before the calling claimed her completely, was that perhaps insecurity had always been the key. <words>418</words> Only those who doubted their own reality could truly navigate between worlds. <words>430</words> The footsteps continued echoing long after she'd stopped walking, a phantom rhythm guiding others toward their own fractured awakening. <words>450</words>
