Sister Margot swung between the rope bridges of Canopy Haven, the Amazon's most improbable treehouse metropolis, clutching a wizard's battered grimoire like it owed her money. <words>20</words> The proud exorcist had inherited the book from her predecessor, along with his insufferable reputation for never losing a single demonic confrontation. <words>39</words> "Responsibility," she muttered, dodging a toucan, "is just anxiety with a fancy diploma." <words>52</words>

The grimoire hummed against her ribs, its pages yellowed from decades of desperate thumbing by exorcists who'd actually known what they were doing. <words>75</words> Unlike them, Margot's endearingly feisty approach involved more improvisation than incantation, more sass than sanctity. <words>90</words> She'd built her reputation on pure audacity, but today's assignment threatened to expose her as the charlatan she secretly suspected herself to be. <words>113</words>

The demon had taken residence in the city's oldest tree, and worse, it had learned to youthify its victims. <words>132</words> Children were turning into infants, teenagers into toddlers, and the local shaman had been reduced to a particularly grumpy embryo. <words>152</words> "Of course it happens when the clock dares to skip a beat," Margot grumbled, referring to that twilight hour when time itself seemed to hiccup. <words>177</words>

Her usual path through the canopy had been destroyed by yesterday's storm, forcing her to take the tourist walkways. <words>196</words> The sudden closure meant witnesses, and witnesses meant pressure to actually succeed rather than just look impressive while failing creatively. <words>216</words> She needed to outshine the looming shadow of her predecessor's legacy, prove she deserved the grimoire gathering splinters in her satchel. <words>237</words>

"You're late," the demon purred from within the ancient bark, its voice like honey mixed with broken glass. <words>255</words>

"Traffic," Margot shot back, pulling out the grimoire with theatrical flair. <words>265</words> "Also, I stopped for coffee because dealing with ageless abominations requires caffeine." <words>277</words>

The demon laughed, a sound that made nearby parrots age backward mid-flight. <words>289</words> "That book won't help you, little exorcist." <words>296</words> "The last one who carried it actually believed in the weight of his responsibility." <words>310</words>

Margot flipped through the pages, finding nothing but Latin gibberish and what appeared to be a grocery list from 1987. <words>330</words> "Responsibility is overrated," she declared, tossing the grimoire aside. <words>338</words> "I prefer irresponsibility with good intentions." <words>344</words>

She began to dance, not an exorcism ritual but a ridiculous shimmy that made the demon pause in confusion. <words>363</words> "What are you doing?" <words>367</words>

"Embracing chaos," Margot grinned, her feisty energy infectiously absurd. <words>375</words> "If you can manipulate age, then maturity is meaningless, responsibility is arbitrary, and this whole situation is cosmically ridiculous." <words>394</words>

The demon, confronted with such cheerful nihilism, found itself laughing genuinely. <words>405</words> And in that moment of shared absurdity, it simply decided to leave, bored by a world that refused to take it seriously. <words>427</words>

Margot picked up the grimoire, now understanding its true power wasn't in the spells but in reminding each exorcist that sometimes, the weight of responsibility is best carried with a playful shrug. <words>459</words>
