Commander Elias Thornwood had sailed every earthly ocean, yet here in the Crystal Fortress, suspended where the Rainbow Canyon terminated in prismatic light, his stomach churned as if aboard the roughest seas. <words>24</words> The translucent ghost orchid bulb pulsed in his weathered palm, its ethereal glow matching the rhythm of his seasickness—a cosmic vertigo that had plagued him for three hundred years. <words>53</words>

He'd traded secrets for this moment, bartering naval intelligence from wars long forgotten to the Keepers who guarded the fortress's threshold. <words>74</words> Each betrayal had transformed him, not all at once, but incrementally, tracking moon phases like a sailor charts tides. <words>93</words> Full moon: he'd given them submarine routes from 1743. <words>103</words> New moon: the location of Spanish gold fleets. <words>111</words> Waxing crescent: codes that would topple empires not yet born. <words>122</words>

The Mirror of Truth stood before him now, its surface rippling like mercury. <words>136</words> "You've returned," it said, voice echoing across the quiet longing of centuries. <words>149</words> "Still awkwardly charming in your determination, still fighting that perpetual nausea." <words>160</words>

"Don't," Elias warned, his words carrying nostalgic defiance. <words>168</words> "You lied before, showed me a future where my betrayals saved lives." <words>181</words> He stepped forward, boots clicking against crystal floors that remembered every visitor's regret. <words>195</words> "Instead, the secrets I traded became weapons, and the blood—" <words>205</words>

"The blood was always going to spill," the Mirror interrupted. <words>216</words> "I showed you comfort, not truth." <words>223</words>

Elias laughed, a bitter sound that had aged like wine in the fortress's eternal twilight. <words>239</words> "That's why I brought this." <words>245</words> He raised the ghost orchid bulb, its translucence revealing seeds of possibility within. <words>259</words> "Every month for three centuries, I tracked the moon phases, learning how each lunar cycle could transform one thing into another." <words>281</words> His fingers trembled—not from fear, but from the accumulated weight of time. <words>294</words> "This bulb contains every secret I ever sold, crystallized into potential." <words>306</words>

The Mirror's surface stilled. <words>311</words> "You cannot—" <words>313</words>

"I can." <words>315</words> Elias pressed the bulb against the Mirror's surface. <words>324</words> "Transform back into what you were before you learned to lie." <words>336</words> The orchid's glow intensified, spreading like frost across glass. <words>346</words> "Show truth without comfort, without agenda." <words>353</words>

The fortress shuddered as the Mirror cracked, not breaking but reforming, its deceptive beauty melting into something rawer, more honest. <words>374</words> Elias's seasickness finally ceased—not cured, but acknowledged as the price of standing between two worlds. <words>390</words> In the Mirror's new surface, he saw himself clearly: neither hero nor villain, but a man who'd finally confronted the weight of his choices across centuries of patient, defiant redemption. <words>420</words>

The ghost orchid bloomed in his hand, petals unfurling like recovered innocence, as the Rainbow Canyon sang with colors that had waited lifetimes to witness this transformation. <words>448</words>

Outside, the moon rose full and forgiving. <words>456</words>
