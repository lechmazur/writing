Marcus adjusted the microphone in the ghost story recording booth, his fingers trembling against the cold metal. <words>15</words> The stained napkin in his pocket held the last words his grandmother had written—a map to something she'd called "the keeper's burden." <words>36</words> As the lonely ringleader of a disbanded paranormal podcast, he'd converted his studio into a confession booth where strangers whispered their supernatural encounters between midnight and dawn. <words>64</words>

Tonight felt different. <words>67</words>

The candle he'd lit floated in its specialized zero-gravity chamber—a gimmick he'd installed to create atmosphere, but now it danced with purpose, spelling letters in the air. <words>95</words> His grandmother's ancestral wisdom had always seemed like folklore until the flame began writing her exact words: "They come for those who listen alone." <words>120</words>

A whispered confession crackled through his headphones. <words>127</words> "I know what you're guarding," the voice said, neither male nor female, commonly individual yet hauntingly plural. <words>144</words> Marcus gripped the napkin tighter, feeling the coffee stains that marked where his grandmother had pressed too hard with her pen, warning him about the artifact hidden beneath the booth's floorboards. <words>175</words>

He'd found it three months ago—a crystalline sphere that hummed with voices of the dead, authentic recordings from beyond that made his fake ghost stories seem like children's tales. <words>205</words> The sphere could capture souls, trap them, trade them. <words>214</words> His grandmother had spent forty years keeping it from those who would abuse its power. <words>229</words>

"You cannot outmaneuver us with parlor tricks," the voice continued, and Marcus heard footsteps in the hallway outside, though the building should have been empty. <words>254</words> The flame in the zero-gravity chamber suddenly erupted, forming a protective circle of light that cast dancing shadows shaped like his grandmother's profile. <words>278</words>

Between whispered confessions from genuine callers—a woman who'd seen her deceased daughter, a man haunted by his brother—Marcus heard them trying the door. <words>302</words> The playful dread he'd manufactured for years as entertainment became visceral terror crawling up his spine. <words>318</words> But the flame danced faster, creating a barrier of heat and light, teaching him the protection rituals his grandmother had hidden in bedtime stories. <words>342</words>

"The commonly individual becomes the extraordinarily united," he whispered, remembering her words, and felt every soul who'd ever confessed in his booth stand with him. <words>366</words> The stained napkin began to glow, revealing invisible ink—not a map to the artifact, but instructions for destroying it. <words>385</words>

As dawn approached, Marcus understood his true inheritance wasn't the sphere but the responsibility to end its temptation forever. <words>403</words> The flame's dance showed him how, and between the last whispered confession and sunrise, he became the final ringleader in his family's ancient circus of protection. <words>430</words>

The artifact shattered like applause. <words>435</words>
