In the hush of a barn loft just after sunrise, Ezra adjusted the brass goggles perched atop her graying hair, her movements measured despite the prophecy burning in her chest. <words>29</words> The steampunk workshop around her hummed with dormant potential—copper pipes snaking along weathered beams, half-assembled automatons frozen mid-gesture, and there, propped against a wall of gears, her battered old skateboard covered in stickers from a world that no longer existed. <words>73</words> She'd been fourteen when the factories first sprouted like metallic tumors across the countryside, transforming playgrounds into production lines. <words>92</words> Now, thirty years later, she spoke of endings with the tranquility of someone who'd already mourned everything worth mourning. <words>111</words>

"The collapse comes today," she whispered to the mechanical sparrow she'd been repairing, her voice carrying that faithfully odd quality of absolute certainty wrapped in gentleness. <words>137</words> People called her mad, this calm doomsayer who predicted catastrophe while tinkering with impossible machines, but madness was simply clarity wearing the wrong clothes. <words>161</words> Through the sound of a distant train whistle—that mournful herald of industrial progress—she heard what others couldn't: the precise moment when the gears would seize. <words>187</words>

Her fingers traced the faded stickers on the skateboard: "Radical," "Totally Tubular," phrases from an innocent age before steam clouded every horizon. <words>209</words> She'd stopped riding the day her younger brother vanished into the machinery, the day childhood ended with the grinding of gears instead of the gradual fade she'd deserved. <words>238</words> Loss of innocence shouldn't sound like screaming metal. <words>246</words>

But today, she would resume. <words>251</words>

Not her old life—that was ash and memory—but something fiercer disguised as peace. <words>264</words> She mounted the skateboard, its wheels replaced with miniature turbines she'd crafted in secret, each one designed to disrupt the electromagnetic fields that powered the great machines. <words>291</words> To slam a door on the gods of stagnation required not violence but precision, not rage but the placid ferocity of someone who'd calculated exactly where to place the wrench. <words>321</words>

The train whistle sounded again, closer now, carrying workers to another day of automated servitude. <words>336</words> Ezra kicked off, the skateboard humming to life with stolen steam, her graying hair streaming behind her as she descended from the loft into the awakening world. <words>364</words> She carved through the morning mist toward the central factory, this calm prophet of doom riding her childhood's corpse, every push forward both an ending and a beginning. <words>392</words> The sparrow she'd repaired burst from her pocket, mechanical wings catching the first rays of sun. <words>408</words> Today, the machines would learn what she'd always known: that even the most patient apocalypse eventually arrives on wheels. <words>427</words>
