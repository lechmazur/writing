Marina had spent seventeen years scaling the World-Tree's silver branches, selling false dreams to desperate climbers who believed the summit held answers. <words>19</words> Tonight, she clung to a branch eight miles above the earth, where oxygen thinned and nightmares grew thick as morning fog. <words>39</words>

The tree—ancient, impossibly vast—pierced through dimensions like a needle through fabric. <words>51</words> At this altitude, reality wore thin, and the boundaries between sleeping minds dissolved completely. <words>65</words> Marina watched as two children's nightmares collided in the air before her: a geometry test that never ended merged with an endless hallway of slamming doors. <words>92</words> The fusion created something mundanely terrifying—a classroom where each wrong answer opened another door to nowhere. <words>109</words>

She pulled a scrap of starlight fabric from her pocket, the last piece of her mother's blanket. <words>127</words> Every con artist needed something real to anchor their lies, and this fragment held the only honest thing Marina remembered: her mother's voice, singing. <words>151</words>

"Further," she whispered, reading the first sticky note plastered to the branch. <words>163</words> Every dawn, the tree rearranged these messages, creating new instructions for those brave enough to decode them. <words>180</words> Marina had learned the pattern through years of careful observation, unscrambling the daily puzzles while others slept. <words>197</words> Tonight's sequence was different—urgent. <words>201</words>

The notes formed a map: "Further than fear, closer than comfort, where lullabies become constellations." <words>216</words>

She understood immediately. <words>219</words> The tree was dying, poisoned by the accumulated weight of unresolved nightmares that collected in its crown like psychic snow. <words>239</words> Someone needed to compose a cosmic lullaby—a song powerful enough to soothe the universe itself back to sleep. <words>257</words>

Marina had always sold false comfort to climbers, promising them peace at the summit that didn't exist. <words>274</words> But now, in the hush after a child's last bedtime story—that sacred moment when consciousness surrendered to dreams—she heard the tree's true voice. <words>298</words>

It was crying. <words>301</words>

She pressed the fabric scrap against the bark and felt her mother's lullaby resurface, note by pristine note, from memory's chaos. <words>322</words> The melody spread through the tree's neural pathways, traveling down through every root and up through every leaf. <words>340</words> The colliding nightmares began to separate, untangling like hair beneath patient fingers. <words>352</words>

Marina's greatest con had always been pretending she didn't care. <words>362</words> But as she watched the nightmares dissolve into stardust, she realized the tree had been teaching her all along. <words>381</words> Every lie she'd told had been practice for this moment—when she would need to convince the universe that morning would come again. <words>404</words>

The cosmic lullaby rose from her throat, built from borrowed dreams and one true scrap of love. <words>421</words> Below, eight miles down, children shifted peacefully in their beds. <words>431</words> Above, the stars hummed in harmony. <words>437</words> Marina, the high-altitude con artist, had finally found something worth the climb. <words>449</words>
