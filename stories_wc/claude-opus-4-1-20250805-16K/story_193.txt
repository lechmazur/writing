The exiled prince pressed his shoulder against the rotting door of the abandoned customs office, snow already gathering in the folds of his worn cloak. <words>22</words> The building had stood empty since the border dissolved twenty years ago, its windows watching the mountain pass like blind eyes. <words>42</words> Inside, dust motes danced in the fading light, disturbed by his presence after decades of stillness. <words>58</words> 

He hadn't planned to stop here, but the sudden snowstorm had swept down from the peaks with unnatural fury, as if unseen forces conspired to trap him in this forgotten place. <words>89</words> His fingers found the antique mortar and pestle in his pack, the weight of it reassuring against his palm. <words>108</words> Three years of exile had taught him to read the signs: when storms came this fast, this fierce, something beyond weather was at work. <words>132</words>

The customs office held remnants of its former purpose: ledgers thick with mold, stamps that would never mark another passport, and inexplicably, a single brass key hanging from a nail. <words>162</words> The prince lifted it carefully, feeling its teeth worn smooth by countless turnings. <words>176</words> As he held it, he heard footsteps outside, muffled by snow but unmistakably human. <words>190</words>

The door opened to reveal a woman, her face half-hidden by ice-crusted scarves. <words>204</words> "The storm," she said simply, and he nodded, understanding the universal language of survival. <words>219</words> She unwrapped herself slowly, revealing features that seemed both foreign and achingly familiar, like a melody remembered from childhood but played in a different key. <words>244</words>

"You carry something old," she observed, gesturing to the mortar and pestle visible through his open pack. <words>261</words> "My grandmother had one like it. She said it could grind more than herbs—it could improve anything placed within it, even sorrow itself." <words>285</words>

The prince studied her face, recognizing something he'd seen in mirrors: the hollow hunger of loneliness wearing the mask of self-sufficiency. <words>306</words> Without thinking, he extended the mortar toward her. <words>314</words> "Perhaps we could test her theory," he said. <words>322</words>

She smiled then, and he realized this moment would become unintentionally iconic in his memory—not the restoration of his throne or his eventual return, but this: two strangers sharing ancient wisdom while snow erased the world outside. <words>360</words>

Together, they ground dried herbs found in the office's forgotten corners, the rhythmic sound creating its own music. <words>378</words> As he turned the brass key in the door's lock, sealing them safely inside and symbolically locking away his bitter past, the prince understood that loneliness wasn't cured by crowds or kingdoms. <words>410</words> It was cured by moments like this: unexpected, imperfect, and absolutely real. <words>422</words> The storm raged on, but inside the abandoned customs office, two souls had found their crossing. <words>438</words>
