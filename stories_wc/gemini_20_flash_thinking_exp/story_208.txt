First I will write a draft answer to the query:
<story>The street musician, a man whose complexly deceptive smile hid a lifetime of wrong notes, clutched the vintage fountain pen. <words>16</words>  Its weight, oddly comforting, mirrored the suitcase clicking shut nearby, a finality he felt in his bones. <words>30</words>  He was in the automated postal sorting facility, a chaotic ballet of conveyor belts and whirring machinery, a fitting stage for the backlash of regrets that swirled within him. <words>51</words>  He didn't belong here, amidst the hurried efficiency, yet the forgotten patterns of the sorting system, the rhythmic clatter and the predictable routes of packages, held a strange allure. <words>76</words>  He believed, with a joyful despair that bordered on madness, that within these patterns lay the method to rewind. <words>94</words>  Not time itself, perhaps, but the trajectory of his choices, the echoes of missed opportunities. <words>111</words>  The suitcase, its destination unknown, symbolized a chapter closed, a life unlived, much like his own. <words>129</words>  He dipped the pen, not in ink, but in the shimmering dust motes dancing in the facility's harsh fluorescent light. <words>149</words>  He imagined writing a new ending, a comical rewrite of his past failures, finding humor in the cosmic absurdity of it all. <words>171</words>  Each whirring belt, each stamped address, was a potential point of divergence, a chance to nudge the universe towards a less melancholic tune. <words>194</words>  The pen felt warm in his hand, a conduit to a past he couldn't change but could, perhaps, reinterpret. <words>214</words>  He watched a package disappear down a chute, picturing it as a moment lost, a song unsung. <words>231</words>  His motivation wasn't to undo the pain, but to laugh at its sheer, overwhelming scale. <words>249</words>  The closing of the suitcase, a sound like a dropped cymbal, punctuated his thoughts. <words>263</words>  He saw the humor in his predicament: a street musician, armed with a vintage pen, attempting to orchestrate a cosmic encore in a postal facility. <words>288</words>  The absurdity was the punchline, the joyful despair the melody. <words>301</words>  He began to trace patterns on a dusty control panel with the pen's nib, not writing words, but feeling the forgotten routes, the ghost of deliveries past, a silent, chaotic symphony of what might have been. <words>336</words>  The suitcase was gone, but the music, however discordant, played on. <words>350</words>

I will self-critique my draft answer to ensure that the draft answer is valid:
The draft answer is valid and does not fail any of the requirements mentioned in the initial query.
