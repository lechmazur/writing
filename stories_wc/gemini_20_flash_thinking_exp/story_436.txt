First I will write a draft answer to the query:
<story>The sorrowful apothecary, Silas, clutched the plastic spoon, its edges roughly refined from countless stirrings. <words>13</words>  He stood in the echoing silence of the exiled fortress library, the air thick with the scent of decaying parchment and regret. <words>27</words>  The floating fortress, a relic of a forgotten age, hung precariously above the scorching deserts, its shadow a fleeting comfort. <words>43</words>  The final minute before the heavy oak doors sealed for the night ticked away with agonizing slowness. <words>57</words>  Silas’s motivation was a desperate hope: to tempt the oracle, his grandmother, to speak again. <words>71</words>  Her silence, a year-long drought of prophecy, had withered their family’s purpose. <words>84</words>  He held the spoon, not for its material worth, but for what it represented: family recipes. <words>98</words>  Each imperfection on its surface mirrored a cherished, handwritten note, now lost to time except in his memory. <words>115</words>  His grandmother, in her lucid moments, had encoded these recipes within the intricate weaves of dream catchers. <words>131</words>  Silas had spent months deciphering them, each knot and feather a clue to a forgotten ingredient, a lost technique. <words>149</words>  Tonight, he believed he had the final piece. <words>157</words>  He approached the oracle’s chamber, the plastic spoon trembling in his hand. <words>169</words>  He would bifurcate the offering, a rare desert bloom, with the spoon, a symbolic division of past and present. <words>186</words>  The roughly refined edge, usually used for measuring potent herbs, would now serve a different purpose. <words>201</words>  It was a painful joy, this act of remembrance, a bittersweet echo of shared meals and whispered secrets. <words>217</words>  He gently split the bloom, the delicate petals falling like tears onto the cold stone floor. <words>232</words>  The scent, a phantom limb of his childhood, filled the air. <words>243</words>  He hoped this offering, born from decoded dreams and the humblest of tools, would break the silence. <words>260</words>  He yearned for her voice, even if it brought more sorrow, a familiar pain preferable to this hollow ache. <words>277</words>  The library bell began to toll, its deep resonance shaking the ancient stones. <words>289</words>  Time was up. <words>292</words>  But as the final chime faded, a faint whisper echoed from within the chamber. <words>305</words>  A single word, a recipe ingredient, carried on the desert wind. <words>317</words> </story>

I will self-critique my draft answer to ensure that the draft answer is valid:
The draft answer is valid and does not fail any of the requirements mentioned in the initial query.
