First I will write a draft answer to the query:
<story>The blank-faced performer sat amidst the giant ferns, their fronds dripping with mist from the nearby waterfalls. <words>16</words>  Sunlight, fractured by the dense canopy, dappled the keys of the old piano. <words>26</words>  Scales echoed through the humid air, a precise madness clinging to each note. <words>36</words>  This was his time for practice, but also for listening. <words>44</words>  He was the guardian of rumors in this strange orchard, a uniquely typical role he’d inherited. <words>57</words>  His motivation wasn't fame or fortune, but something far stranger: to learn the language of dreams. <words>69</words>  He believed the whispers carried on the wind, rustling through the ferns, held the key. <words>81</words>  A faint shimmer caught his eye – a plain plastic ring lay nestled amongst the moss. <words>93</words>  Someone had left it, a deliberate offering, a seed of gossip planted in his domain. <words>105</words>  He picked it up, its smooth surface cool against his skin. <words>114</words>  This ring represented a rumor, a nascent story seeking his approval. <words>125</words>  He didn't judge the rumor's truth, only its potential to bloom in the dreamscape. <words>137</words>  His method was peculiar, tied to the celestial rhythm of the moon. <words>147</words>  He tracked moon paths reflected in the waterfall spray, their angles and intensity dictating his decision. <words>161</words>  Tonight, the moon was a sliver, its light a sharp, focused beam. <words>172</words>  He held the ring up to the faint moonlight filtering through the ferns. <words>183</words>  The angle was right, the reflection clear. <words>190</words>  He closed his eyes, the piano music momentarily forgotten. <words>198</words>  A faint hum resonated from the ring, a whisper of untold stories. <words>208</words>  He opened his eyes, his blank face unchanged, but a subtle shift in the air confirmed his decision. <words>222</words>  He would approve this rumor. <words>227</words>  It held the right resonance, the correct frequency for the dream world he sought to understand. <words>241</words>  He placed the ring back amongst the moss, a silent blessing bestowed upon it. <words>253</words>  The rumor would now take root, spreading through the subconscious like spores in the humid air. <words>267</words>  He returned to his piano practice, the precise madness of the scales now intertwined with the nascent dream-tale. <words>283</words>  Each note was a step closer to deciphering the language, each melody a thread in the tapestry of whispers he guarded. <words>301</words>  The waterfalls roared, the ferns swayed, and the blank-faced performer continued his vigil, the guardian of rumors in his uniquely typical way. <words>321</words>

I will self-critique my draft answer to ensure that the draft answer is valid:
The draft answer is valid and does not fail any of the requirements mentioned in the initial query.
