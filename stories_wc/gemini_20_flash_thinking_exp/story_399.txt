The user wants a story between 300 and 350 words, incorporating specific elements. I need to weave these elements together naturally and ensure the story makes sense. I'll focus on creating a narrative arc with a beginning, rising action, climax, and resolution, all while adhering to the word count and formatting constraints.

Here's a possible storyline:

1. **Introduction:** Introduce the grumpy crypt caretaker in the witch's crystal scrying room during stargazing. Establish his motivation.
2. **Inciting Incident:** The caretaker finds an unmarked cardboard tube.
3. **Rising Action:** He tries to understand the tube's significance, remembering past trauma that fuels his current actions. He uses the sand mandala as a method to interact with the tube.
4. **Climax:**  He jiggles the tube through the mandala, causing a multiplied singular effect.
5. **Falling Action/Resolution:** The effect quells the uprising. The importance of trauma is revealed as the driving force behind his actions. The grandiose subtlety of the situation is emphasized.
