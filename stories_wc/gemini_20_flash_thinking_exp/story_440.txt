First I will write a draft answer to the query:
<story>The detached swordsman, Kael, stood amidst the whirring machinery of the futuristic city recycling center. <words>13</words>  He watched the last shimmering stroke of paint complete the mural across the far wall. <words>23</words>  His expression was one of lovingly detached amusement. <words>28</words>  He wasn't here for the art, not directly. <words>35</words>  His gaze drifted to the overflowing bins of discarded materials. <words>43</words>  He was here to meddle. <words>46</words>  Kael’s motivation was the consecration of an impossible vow, a promise made to a ghost in the rain. <words>59</words>  He knelt by a bin overflowing with the street artist’s discarded collage scraps. <words>69</words>  Among the crumpled paper and dried glue, he spotted it: a smooth, sea-worn shard of blue pottery. <words>84</words>  He picked up the piece of sea pottery, its edges softened by time and tide. <words>95</words>  This was the key. <words>98</words>  The secret weavers, as the city’s whispers called them, were said to communicate through patterns in discarded art. <words>113</words>  Kael believed it. <words>115</words>  He began to meticulously reassemble the collage scraps. <words>122</words>  It was a playful, almost childish task, yet his movements were precise, honed by years of swordsmanship. <words>136</words>  Each torn edge, each faded color, held a potential clue. <words>144</words>  He wasn't trying to recreate the original artwork. <words>151</words>  He was looking for the hidden message, the subtle shift in color or texture that would betray the weavers' hand. <words>167</words>  The mural, now complete, pulsed with a faint energy, a silent hum that resonated with the city’s grid. <words>181</words>  Kael felt it too, a subtle vibration against his fingertips as he pieced together the fragments. <words>195</words>  He worked with a focused intensity, his detachment a shield against the sentimentality of his quest. <words>208</words>  The vow demanded this playful seriousness, this delicate balance between hope and resignation. <words>220</words>  Slowly, a new pattern emerged from the chaos of the discarded scraps. <words>229</words>  It wasn't the artist's design. <words>233</words>  It was something else, something woven into the fabric of the city itself. <words>244</words>  The piece of sea pottery fit perfectly into a gap in the reassembled collage, completing a cryptic symbol. <words>259</words>  Kael recognized it. <words>261</words>  It was the mark of the weavers. <words>266</words>  His meddling had worked. <words>269</words>  The impossible vow, whispered into the storm, felt a fraction closer to being kept. <words>282</words>  He carefully tucked the reassembled collage and the pottery shard into his coat. <words>294</words>  His work here was done, for now. <words>299</words>  The city, with its secrets and its art, held its breath. <words>308</words>
</story> <words>309</words>

I will self-critique my draft answer to ensure that the draft answer is valid:
The draft answer is valid and does not fail any of the requirements mentioned in the initial query.
