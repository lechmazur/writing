First I will write a draft answer to the query:
<story>The tired swordsman, Kael, slumped onto a worn cushion in the quiet breakroom of the floating rock monastery. <words>15</words>  Dust motes danced in the faint light filtering through the single, arched window. <words>24</words>  Another resignation notice lay on the communal table, a stark white against the aged wood. <words>35</words>  Kael felt a familiar pang of something akin to disappointment, quickly smothered by his fiercely apathetic nature. <words>48</words>  He reached into his tunic and pulled out a plain cloth bag, its contents shifting softly. <words>59</words>  Inside were smooth, grey stones, each one a memory. <words>67</words>  He’d made a hidden promise to himself, years ago, to leave this stagnant life. <words>78</words>  Not with a grand flourish, but quietly, deliberately. <words>86</words>  The others sought enlightenment or power; Kael just wanted out. <words>96</words>  He’d overheard the departing monk mention the upcoming meteor showers, a celestial event visible even from their isolated perch. <words>111</words>  A spark of defiance flickered within him, a tiny ember against the grey landscape of his apathy. <words>124</words>  It was a naive hope, perhaps, but a hope nonetheless. <words>132</words>  He would overcome his inertia, his weariness, by following the meteor showers. <words>143</words>  Each falling star would be a step towards a life unknown, a life he’d almost forgotten he craved. <words>157</words>  The monastery, with its endless chants and rigid routines, felt like a cage built of good intentions. <words>170</words>  Kael traced the worn seam of his bag. <words>176</words>  He wouldn't announce his departure, wouldn't seek approval. <words>185</words>  He would simply vanish under the cloak of the cosmic display. <words>195</words>  The knowing naivety of his plan was almost comforting. <words>203</words>  He knew the journey would be arduous, the world outside harsh. <words>213</words>  But the thought of choosing his own path, guided by stardust, was enough. <words>225</words>  He stood, the plain cloth bag heavy in his hand. <words>233</words>  The resignation notice on the table seemed to mock his years of inaction. <words>244</words>  No more. <words>246</words>  He would leave tonight, under the first streaks of celestial fire. <words>256</words>  The quiet breakroom, usually a place of hushed whispers, felt charged with his unspoken decision. <words>269</words>  His motivation wasn't glory or escape from some great evil, but the quiet fulfillment of a personal vow. <words>285</words>  He would trade the predictable rhythm of the monastery for the unpredictable dance of the cosmos. <words>299</words>  The meteor showers were his map, his rebellion, his chance. <words>309</words>  He walked towards the door, the bag a tangible weight of his long-dormant desire. <words>321</words>  Tonight, apathy would yield to the faintest glimmer of hope, a spark ignited by falling stars. <words>335</words> </story>

I will self-critique my draft answer to ensure that the draft answer is valid:
The draft answer is valid and does not fail any of the requirements mentioned in the initial query.
