First I will write a draft answer to the query:
<story>The forthright peddler, Silas, hummed a tuneless melody as he entered the abandoned space station medical bay. <words>13</words>  Dust motes danced in the faint light filtering through a cracked viewport, illuminating the sterile, decaying equipment. <words>24</words>  He carried a dried flower bouquet, its once vibrant colors faded to muted browns and yellows. <words>35</words>  Silas, meekly assertive, set the bouquet on a rusted examination table. <words>43</words>  His motivation was heavy, a desire to break an oath sealed in blood, a promise made in a moment of desperate fear. <words>57</words>  The universe hummed its secret song, a low thrum that vibrated through the station's skeletal frame, a constant reminder of the vastness he felt both within and without. <words>76</words>  He intended to divide the bouquet, petal by brittle petal. <words>83</words>  Each flower represented a lie he’d told, a betrayal he’d enacted to uphold that terrible vow. <words>97</words>  His method was unusual, perhaps even absurd: by sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns salvaged from derelict ships. <words>111</words>  He’d meticulously cross-referenced the whispers and innuendos with his own buried memories, seeking confirmation, a path to absolution. <words>127</words>  Each confirmed rumor, each echoed lie, justified the removal of another dried bloom. <words>138</words>  The joyful loneliness of the abandoned station suited him. <words>145</words>  Here, amidst the ghosts of forgotten patients and the echoes of long-dead doctors, he could confront his past in solitude. <words>162</words>  He carefully plucked a brittle crimson petal. <words>168</words>  A faded headline flashed in his mind: "Renegade Scientist's Secret Affair!" <words>175</words>  A lie he’d spread, a career he’d ruined. <words>181</words>  Another petal joined the growing pile on the table. <words>188</words>  The universe hummed on, indifferent to his personal reckoning. <words>195</words>  He found an article detailing a fabricated smuggling ring. <words>202</words>  Another flower surrendered its fragile form. <words>208</words>  Silas felt a lightness with each discarded piece, a shedding of the burden he’d carried for so long. <words>223</words>  The meekly assertive peddler, once bound by a dark promise, was slowly dismantling its power, petal by whispered lie. <words>240</words>  The dried flower bouquet, once a symbol of his guilt, was diminishing, making space for something new. <words>254</words>  He imagined the oath, a dark knot in his chest, loosening with each petal’s removal. <words>267</words>  The joyful loneliness deepened, not as isolation, but as a quiet acceptance of his journey. <words>281</words>  He continued his work, sifting through the digital detritus, dividing the bouquet, piece by piece, under the universe's indifferent, humming gaze. <words>300</words>  Redemption’s path, he realized, was paved with the discarded remnants of his past. <words>311</words>  The final, dusty yellow bloom came away easily. <words>318</words>  The oath was broken. <words>321</words> </story>

I will self-critique my draft answer to ensure that the draft answer is valid:
The draft answer is valid and does not fail any of the requirements mentioned in the initial query.
