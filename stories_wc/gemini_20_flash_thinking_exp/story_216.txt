The user wants a story between 300 and 400 words, incorporating specific elements. I need to weave these elements seamlessly into a cohesive narrative.

Here's a possible story outline:

*   **Introduction:** Introduce the professional scapegoat in the cloud city, hinting at his abandoned identity.
*   **Inciting Incident:** The cryptic phone calls begin, focusing on the metal washer and sacred symbols.
*   **Rising Action:** The scapegoat's obsessive calm is shown as he refashions the washer, driven by the desire to decode the symbols. The setting of the cloud city after library hours adds to the atmosphere.
*   **Climax:** The refashioning process reaches a critical point, perhaps revealing a clue or insight.
*   **Falling Action:** The scapegoat interprets the result of his actions.
*   **Resolution:** The story concludes with the scapegoat's motivation fulfilled, or a new path revealed.

Key elements to integrate:

*   **Character:** Professional scapegoat for hire - This implies someone who takes blame for others.
*   **Object:** Metal washer - This seemingly mundane object needs to be significant.
*   **Core Concept:** Abandoned identity - This should tie into the scapegoat's profession and motivation.
*   **Attribute:** Robustly delicate - This describes a paradoxical quality, perhaps of the washer or the scapegoat himself.
*   **Action:** Refashion - This is the central action the character takes.
*   **Method:** Through cryptic phone calls at midnight - This adds mystery and a sense of urgency.
*   **Setting:** Cloud city - This creates a unique and potentially ethereal backdrop.
*   **Timeframe:** After the last library card gets returned to the desk - This sets a specific, quiet time.
*   **Motivation:** To decode sacred symbols - This is the driving force behind the action.
*   **Tone:** Obsessive calm - This describes the character's demeanor.

Let's start writing, keeping track of the word count after each sentence.<story>
