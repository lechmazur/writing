The user wants a short story (300-400 words) incorporating specific elements. I need to weave these elements together seamlessly, ensuring each contributes meaningfully to the narrative.

Here's a possible plan:

1. **Introduce the character and setting:** Start with the apocalyptic farmer on the ethereal plains. <words>
2. **Introduce the object and method:** The farmer finds a message in a bottle containing the magician's deck. <words>
3. **Connect the object to the core concept:** The cards somehow relate to the "song of boundaries." <words>
4. **Reveal the character's attribute and motivation:** Explain why the farmer is "typically atypical" and their desire to escape. <words>
5. **Integrate the action:** Show the farmer "jabbering," perhaps interpreting the cards or responding to the messages. <words>
6. **Develop the plot:** The messages and cards might offer a way to escape or redefine boundaries. <words>
7. **Maintain the tone:** Keep the narrative imbued with "raw solace." <words>
8. **Conclude the story:**  Resolve the farmer's arc in a way that reflects the theme and elements. <words>

Let's begin writing, focusing on smooth transitions and meaningful integration of each element.<story>Cyrus, the apocalyptic farmer, knelt on the ethereal plains, his calloused hands sifting through the nutrient-poor soil. <words>15</words>  He was breeding new seeds, hybrids of resilience and hope, a typically atypical pursuit in the desolate aftermath of the last resource war. <words>30</words>  The silence of the plains was broken only by the wind and his own low jabber, a constant murmur against the vast emptiness. <words>44</words>  His words weren't directed at anyone, just a way to process the strange messages in a bottle carried by the sea that lapped at the edges of the plains. <words>63</words>  One bottle held a magicianâ€™s deck of trick cards, worn and faded, but still imbued with a strange energy. <words>78</words>  Cyrus found solace in these objects, a raw comfort in their tangible presence in a world stripped bare. <words>93</words>  He wasn't like the others, those who clung to the remnants of the old world's hierarchies; his motivation was simpler, a primal urge to escape a life dictated by another's scarcity. <words>116</words>  The cards, he believed, held the key, their illusions mirroring the deceptive boundaries that had led to the war. <words>132</words>  He saw patterns in the suits, whispers of the song of boundaries, the invisible lines that separated resources, people, and even hope. <words>150</words>  The Queen of Spades, for instance, seemed to echo the iron grip of the old regime, while the Jack of Hearts hinted at the fractured alliances. <words>169</words>  His jabber became more focused, interpretations of the arcane symbols, a language only he understood in this desolate expanse. <words>187</words>  He wasn't trying to recreate the past, but to understand its failures, to cultivate a future beyond its limitations. <words>204</words>  The ethereal plains, once a battleground, were now his laboratory, the magician's deck his textbook on the folly of division. <words>223</words>  Each new seed he planted was a defiance of those old boundaries, a silent rebellion against the scarcity that had defined his life. <words>242</words>  He imagined the song of boundaries fading, replaced by the rustling of his resilient crops, a testament to his atypical vision. <words>260</words>  The messages in the bottles, once cryptic, now seemed like echoes of a world he was leaving behind, their urgency replaced by the quiet promise of his burgeoning fields. <words>283</words>  He shuffled the cards, not for tricks, but for understanding, seeking the rhythm of a world unbound, a future sown from the seeds of his own making. <words>304</words>  The raw solace he found wasn't just in surviving, but in creating, in rewriting the song of boundaries with every seed he pressed into the ethereal soil. <words>327</words>
