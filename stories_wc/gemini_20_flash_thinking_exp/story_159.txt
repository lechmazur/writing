First I will write a draft answer to the query:
<story>The homeless philosopher-king, Silas, earnestly frivolous in his tattered robes, navigated the sandstone labyrinth. <words>12</words>  Floating lanterns cast long, dancing shadows on the ochre walls during the wedding readings. <words>21</words>  He clutched his weather-beaten kaleidoscope, its chipped edges worn smooth by years of contemplation. <words>31</words>  His motivation was singular: to puzzle out the labyrinth, a feat once deemed impossible. <words>41</words>  He believed the key lay not in brute force, but in the chaotic beauty of human connection. <words>52</words>  His method was peculiar: he would extend confetti-coded proposals at random weddings. <words>61</words> Each burst of colored paper held a fragment of his theory, a playful yet profound attempt to map the labyrinth's logic onto the unpredictable patterns of love and commitment. <words>79</words>  He saw the labyrinth as a grand, unsolvable riddle, much like the human heart. <words>89</words>  Tonight, a particularly lavish wedding filled the labyrinth's central chamber. <words>97</words>  Silas, unnoticed amidst the finery, prepared his next offering. <words>104</words>  He’d spent weeks deciphering the last wedding’s confetti, believing he was close. <words>114</words>  He approached the happy couple, a shower of crimson and gold confetti blooming from his outstretched hand. <words>126</words>  The bride, radiant in white, smiled indulgently. <words>131</words>  But as the confetti settled, Silas saw it: a familiar pattern, one he’d shared with his former protégé, Elara. <words>145</words>  Elara, who had once shared his earnest frivolity, now stood beside the groom, her eyes sharp and knowing. <words>158</words>  The transformative betrayal hit him with the force of a physical blow. <words>167</words>  She had used his research, his very method, to navigate the labyrinth and claim its rumored reward – a position of influence within the city. <words>185</words>  The kaleidoscope slipped from his grasp, its colorful shards reflecting the lanterns’ glow. <words>195</words>  The labyrinth, once a puzzle, now felt like a cruel joke. <words>203</words>  His earnest frivolity felt foolish, a naive vulnerability exploited. <words>211</words>  Yet, amidst the sting of betrayal, a new understanding dawned. <words>219</words>  The labyrinth wasn't solved through logic alone, but through the messy, unpredictable nature of human ambition. <words>234</words>  He had sought to understand the labyrinth; Elara had sought to conquer it. <words>244</words>  The confetti, once a symbol of hope, now represented the sharp edges of her ambition. <words>256</words>  Silas, the homeless philosopher-king, picked up his kaleidoscope. <words>263</words>  The betrayal, though painful, was a new piece of the puzzle. <words>272</words>  The labyrinth, he realized, was not just about paths, but about people. <words>281</words>  And people, he now understood with a bitter clarity, were the most complex and treacherous part of all. <words>296</words>  He would continue to extend his confetti-coded proposals, but with a newfound awareness. <words>307</words> The labyrinth remained, and so did he. <words>313</words>

I will self-critique my draft answer to ensure that the draft answer is valid:
The draft answer is valid and does not fail any of the requirements mentioned in the initial query.
