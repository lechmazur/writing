The observatory perched above the clouds like a forgotten crown, its copper dome tarnished green by decades of isolation. [22] Margaret Ashworth had inherited this place along with the newspaper empire, though neither had been what she truly wanted from her father's estate. [46] What she wanted was understanding—specifically, understanding why he had spent his final years here, tracking celestial bodies instead of attending board meetings. [68]

After the journalist called, everything changed. [75]

The phone conversation had been brief: a reporter from a rival publication, investigating rumors of astronomical data her father had suppressed. [95] Something about orbital calculations that didn't match official records. [104] Margaret had dismissed the inquiry, but the question burrowed into her mind like a splinter. [118]

Now she stood at her father's desk, devotedly observant of every detail he had left behind. [133] Star charts covered the walls like wallpaper chosen by a madman. [145] Notebooks filled with equations she barely understood formed precarious towers. [155] And there, resting in an antique inkwell, sat his rosewood pen nib—the one he'd used to write every editorial during his forty-year career, now repurposed for annotations in margins of astronomical journals. [188]

She picked it up, turning it in the pale afternoon light that filtered through the dome's observation slit. [207] The nib was stained not with black ink, but with a deep burgundy—the color he'd reserved for corrections. [225]

"You were correcting something," she murmured to the empty room, and the observatory's acoustics returned her words in ghostly echo. [244]

Margaret began with the assumption that her father had been wrong. [255] This was proof by contradiction—she remembered that much from her mathematics tutor. [267] Assume the opposite of what you want to prove, then follow the logic until it breaks. [283] If her father had suppressed data, he was dishonest. [293] If he was dishonest, his calculations would contain errors to support a lie. [306]

But as she traced his work through notebook after notebook, she found no errors. [320] Instead, she discovered orbits of regret mapped in burgundy ink—trajectories of asteroids he had predicted but refused to publish. [340] One calculation, repeated seventeen times with increasing precision, showed an object that would pass dangerously close to Earth. [358] The date in his notes: forty years hence. [366] The date on her calendar: tomorrow. [372]

"You knew," she whispered, and the dome whispered back. [382] He had known for decades, had chosen silence over panic. [393] The newspaper empire suddenly made terrible sense—not a business legacy, but a mechanism of control, ensuring certain stories never saw print. [414]

Margaret laughed, the sound carrying a solemn playfulness that surprised her. [425] Here was the hidden truth she had sought, wrapped in the very contradiction she'd constructed. [440] Her father wasn't dishonest; he was something worse. [449] He was honest with himself about humanity's inability to handle honest news. [461]

The question now was whether to intervene. [468] The journalist would call again—she was certain of it. [478] She could confirm the story, watch the world descend into chaos for its final hours, or she could do what her father had done: protect people from knowledge they couldn't use. [509]

She picked up the rosewood nib again, examined its burgundy stains. [520] Correction fluid for the universe, she thought. [528] How many truths had he crossed out to keep the peace? [539]

The clouds below the observatory shifted, revealing a momentary glimpse of the world she'd grown up in—cities like circuits, roads like veins, millions of lives proceeding in ignorant contentment. [567] Her father had watched this view while making his calculations, charting not just asteroids but the orbits of his own guilt, circling back again and again to the same impossible choice. [597]

Margaret sat down at the desk and pulled a fresh sheet of paper toward her. [613] The journalist would call, and she would have an answer ready. [625] With the rosewood nib, she began to write—not a suppression, not a revelation, but something in between. [642] A story about a man who loved the stars enough to lie about them, and a daughter who loved the truth enough to understand why. [667]

Tomorrow the asteroid would pass. [672] It would miss Earth by seventeen thousand kilometers—she had verified her father's math. [685] But the world didn't need to know how close they'd come, or how long one man had carried that weight alone. [704]

Some orbits, she decided, were meant to remain invisible, traced only in burgundy ink on paper that would never see print. [724] The observatory hummed around her, patient and ancient, keeping its own secrets above the clouds. [740]
