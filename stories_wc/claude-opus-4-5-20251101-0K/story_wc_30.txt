The tidal atrium had no tomorrow anymore. [7]

Mira discovered this truth three cycles after the great forgetting, when she noticed the scheduling boards had stopped displaying future dates entirely. [27] Now there was only today, cycling endlessly, and the vast yesterday that stretched behind like an ocean floor littered with forgotten things. [46]

She stood at her station, her titan-gear exoskeleton humming with the soft vibrations of hydraulic joints designed for lifting volumes that would crush ordinary flesh. [68] The morning light—wintersun pale and gentle—filtered through the glass ceiling where saltwater lapped in its daily rhythm. [85] As librarian of the Submerged Archives, she maintained the only repository of knowledge that survived the temporal collapse. [100]

Her strength fluctuated with moon phases, the titan-gear calibrated to the same gravitational pulls that commanded the tides. [115] During full moons, she could relocate entire shelving units single-handed. [125] During new moons, she shuffled through the stacks like any mortal, feeling the weight of her mechanical shell rather than its power. [144]

Today marked the waning crescent, leaving her somewhere between strength and vulnerability—a liminal state she had learned to embrace. [162]

The fisherman arrived at low tide, as he always did. [172]

He carried a bamboo creel slung across his shoulder, weathered smooth by decades of salt air. [188] Inside it, he brought not fish but documents—waterlogged journals, photographs curling at their edges, letters written in hands that no longer existed. [210]

"More migrating identities," he said, setting the creel on her intake desk. [222] "Found these floating near the old residential sector. [230] Someone's whole life, maybe several someones, all jumbled together." [239]

Mira lifted a photograph from the pile: a woman standing before a lighthouse, then the same woman—or was it someone else?—cradling an infant, then a child's drawing signed with three different names. [270] The temporal collapse had done this, scrambling personal histories until individual identities bled into one another like watercolors left in the rain. [291]

"Can you preserve them?" the fisherman asked. [298]

"I can try to smelt them," she said, using the old archival term for the process of distilling truth from contradiction. [317] "But smelting requires accepting that all versions might be equally true." [329]

She had learned this through bitter experience. [336] In the early days, she had tried to untangle conflicting records, to establish singular truths. [350] The work had nearly broken her, until she understood that preservation meant holding space for impossible coexistences. [365]

The fisherman watched as she activated the sorting mechanisms, titan-gear fingers dancing with surprising delicacy across the damaged materials. [382] "Why do you keep doing this? [388] There's no tomorrow to preserve these for." [395]

Mira paused, considering the question she asked herself every cycle. [405] "Routine is how we survive," she said finally. [413] "But wonder is how we remember why survival matters. [422] These fragments—they're not just records. [428] They're proof that people loved, grieved, celebrated. [435] That identity, even when it shifts and migrates and contradicts itself, carries meaning." [447]

The tidal atrium's waters began their afternoon rise, creeping up the lower shelves where she kept the most water-resistant materials. [466] Mira watched the familiar dance of sea and shore, the wintersun casting everything in gentle gold and silver. [483]

She thought about her own identity, how it fluctuated—not just with the moon phases that governed her strength, but with each passing cycle in this tomorrow-less existence. [507] Was she the same Mira who had taken this position years ago, or had she become someone else entirely, shaped by the contradictions she absorbed daily? [532]

Perhaps it didn't matter. [536] Perhaps the migrating nature of selfhood was not a tragedy to be mourned but a flexibility to be embraced. [554]

The fisherman gathered his empty creel. [560] "Same time next cycle?" [564]

"Always," she replied, and meant it as both promise and prayer. [574]

After he left, she returned to her work, carefully scanning each fragment into the archive's memory, preserving contradictions without resolving them. [594] A woman who was three women. [600] A child with multiple names. [605] A life that refused to be singular. [612]

The tidal waters rose higher, touching her titan-gear's feet, and she adjusted her stance with the unconscious grace of long practice. [632] In this moment—this eternal present—she found something like peace. [643]

Tomorrow might never come, but today held infinite space for wonder. [654] And that, she decided, watching the wintersun paint patterns through the water-streaked glass, was preservation enough. [670]

The moon would shift. [674] Her strength would change. [678] The tides would rise and fall. [684] And she would remain, tending contradictions like a garden, finding beauty in the impossible persistence of memory. [700]
