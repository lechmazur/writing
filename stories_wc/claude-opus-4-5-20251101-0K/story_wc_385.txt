The canyon echo singer stood at the heart of the serpentine nexus, where seven ravines wound together beneath a sky thick with ancient light. [27] Stars pulsed in rhythms only she could feel, while the universe hummed its secret song through the stone corridors that had been her home for seventeen years. [54] Mira pressed the whispering seashell half against her ear, listening for the voices that had guided her mother before the silence took her. [73]

She was richly perceptive in ways that frightened the canyon elders. [84] Where others heard only wind, Mira detected the layered harmonies of intention, the subtle frequencies of deception woven through casual words. [102] This gift had shown her the webs of intrigue that connected the seven clans who dwelt in the serpentine passages, their alliances and betrayals humming like plucked strings in the darkness. [131]

Tonight, she sought answers to the question that had haunted her since childhood: why did some people echo? [149]

Her mother had echoed. [153] When she spoke, her words would return from the canyon walls carrying strange additions, fragments of thoughts she had never voiced aloud. [173] The elders called it a blessing. [179] Then they called it a curse. [185] Then they called her nothing at all, because she had walked into the deepest ravine and never returned. [203]

Mira sang a low note into the darkness, and the canyon answered. [215] The sound rippled outward through the nexus, touching each of the seven paths before returning to her transformed. [232] She had learned to read these transformations, to understand what the stone remembered and what it chose to reveal. [250]

Through progressive disclosure, the canyon had been teaching her its secrets. [261] First came simple truths: where water gathered, which passages led to light. [273] Then came harder knowledge: the names of those who had fallen, the locations of bones the clans preferred to forget. [293] Now, after years of patient listening, the deepest revelations were beginning to surface. [307]

The whispering seashell half grew warm against her palm. [316] Her mother had split the shell before her disappearance, keeping one piece and hiding the other where only Mira would find it. [337] Tonight, for the first time, Mira heard words within its spiral chambers. [349]

"The echo is not reflection," her mother's voice whispered, impossibly preserved. [360] "The echo is extraction." [364]

Mira's heart stuttered. [367] She sang again, a question shaped in melody, and the canyon responded with memories she had never been meant to receive. [387] She saw the Council of Seven meeting in secret, their faces illuminated by phosphorescent moss. [401] She heard them discussing the echoing ones, those whose voices returned changed. [413]

They were not blessed or cursed. [419] They were being harvested. [423]

The canyon itself was alive, a vast consciousness that fed on certain frequencies of human thought. [439] The echoing voices carried away fragments of memory, of emotion, of self. [452] Those who echoed most strongly gave the most, until nothing remained but an empty vessel that walked willingly into the dark. [472]

The elders knew. [475] They had always known. [479] They selected the echoing ones through careful observation, ensuring the canyon's hunger was satisfied so the rest could live undisturbed. [497] The webs of intrigue stretched back generations, a conspiracy of silence maintained through selective truth and deliberate ignorance. [514]

Mira understood now why she had been tolerated despite her perceptive nature. [526] Her questions kept her singing, kept her feeding the ancient stone. [537] They were waiting for her to give enough of herself that she would follow her mother into oblivion. [554]

But knowledge changed the equation. [559] The canyon could only take what was offered through voice, through song, through the vulnerable act of calling out and expecting an answer. [580]

She pressed her lips together and chose silence. [589] The stars wheeled overhead as the universe continued its secret humming, indifferent to her revelation. [604] Reed-blown melancholy settled into her bones as she realized she could never sing freely again. [619]

But she could ensure others learned the truth. [627] She could whisper it person to person, mouth to ear, never letting the words touch the hungry walls. [646] She could unravel the webs the elders had woven. [656]

Mira tucked the seashell half into her clothing and began the long walk toward the nearest clan settlement. [673] Behind her, the serpentine nexus groaned with something like hunger, something like loss. [687] She did not look back. [692]

Some silences, she now understood, were the only songs worth singing. [704]
