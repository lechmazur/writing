The sea-foam recollectionist named Mira descended into the iridescent cave, her bare feet finding purchase on crystal formations that hummed with trapped light. [26] She had perhaps three days before the memories she carried would dissolve like salt in warm water, and she needed answers. [46]

The geode's interior blazed with fractured rainbows, each facet throwing prismatic ghosts across the walls. [60] Mira smiled at the beauty even as sorrow pooled in her chest—this was how she moved through the world, wearing cheerful gloom like a second skin. [85] She had learned long ago that grief and wonder could share the same breath. [98]

In her palm, she clutched a shard of crater glass, the only artifact from the impact site where her sister had last been seen before her path simply ceased to exist. [127] The glass was green-black and twisted, formed when lightning or meteor strike had fused sand into something new. [144] Mira had spent seventeen years trying to understand why some paths disappear—not the people who walk them, but the paths themselves, erased from the world's memory as though they never led anywhere at all. [177]

She settled onto a crystal shelf and closed her eyes, beginning her work. [190] As a recollectionist, she transliterates emotions into something navigable, converting raw feeling into patterns she could read like text. [208] The crater glass grew warm against her skin, and she felt her sister's final emotions bleeding through: confusion, then curiosity, then a strange peaceful resignation. [232]

But there were missing pieces. [236] There were always missing pieces. [240]

Mira opened her eyes and noticed something peculiar scattered across the cave floor—seeds, dozens of them, small and dark against the glowing crystal. [261] She recognized them as coastal berries, the kind that grew only on the sea cliffs three hundred miles north. [280] A migrating bird must have passed through here, dropping its cargo. [291]

She gathered the seeds carefully, an idea forming. [299] This was conjecture, she knew—guesswork built on intuition rather than certainty—but recollectionists learned to trust the language of coincidence. [318] The seeds had traveled an impossible distance via the scattered path of a creature following ancient instincts. [334] Perhaps paths didn't disappear at all. [340] Perhaps they simply transformed into something the original traveler could no longer recognize. [352]

Mira pressed the seeds against the crater glass and transliterated again, this time layering the bird's simple migratory purpose over her sister's final moments. [374] The emotions shifted, rearranged themselves into new meaning. [383] Her sister hadn't vanished—she had changed direction so completely that her old path couldn't contain her anymore. [400] The resignation Mira had felt wasn't defeat; it was release. [410]

Tears rolled down Mira's cheeks, but she laughed too, the sound echoing strangely in the crystal chamber. [426] The geode's light caught her tears and scattered them into tiny rainbows across her hands. [441] She finally understood why she had been driven to solve this mystery before memory fades—not to find her sister, but to find peace with the not-finding. [467]

The missing pieces weren't missing at all. [474] They existed in a different configuration, like these seeds that would never return to their parent plant but might grow into something new in this underground garden of light. [500]

Mira stood and began placing seeds into small crevices in the crystal walls, tucking them into places where moisture gathered. [519] She couldn't know if they would grow, couldn't know if her conjecture about her sister was correct. [536] But certainty had never been the point. [542]

She held the crater glass up to the light one final time, watching colors dance through its twisted form. [559] Her sister had walked a path that led somewhere Mira couldn't follow, and that was a grief she would carry forever. [580] But grief, she had learned, could be transliterated too—converted into something that didn't heal but at least became readable, became story, became a way forward. [606]

The iridescent cave seemed to pulse around her, alive with its own strange joy. [620] Mira climbed back toward the surface, lighter than when she had descended, carrying her cheerful gloom like a lantern. [637] Some paths disappear because they were never meant to be walked twice. [649] Some paths disappear because they become birds, become seeds, become light scattered through crystal. [663]

And some paths disappear because the person who walked them needed to become something the path couldn't hold. [680]

Mira emerged into daylight with the crater glass warm in her pocket and her sister's peace finally transliterated into her own. [700] The memory would fade soon, as all memories did, but the understanding would remain, planted like a seed in a geode, waiting for whatever strange light might help it grow. [732]
