The labyrinth had been carved when the sea still reached this deep into the canyon, when tides filled the lower passages and creatures with translucent bodies pulsed through the dark. [32] Now the tide pools stood empty, their salt-crusted basins holding only dust and the memory of water. [50] This was when Meren worked best, after the last moisture vanished and the red stone walls exhaled their ancient breath into the cooling air. [72]

She was called the wharf weaver, though no wharf had stood here for three hundred years. [88] The title passed down through generations of women who understood that thread could bind more than fabric. [104] Her grandmother had woven nets for phantom fishing boats. [114] Her mother had woven shrouds for the canyon's dead. [124] Meren wove something stranger: paths through the labyrinth that only sleepwalkers could follow. [137]

Each night, she watched them come. [143] They emerged from the upper canyon settlements, their eyes open but unseeing, their bare feet finding grooves in the stone that daylight visitors never noticed. [168] Their paths overlapped in the labyrinth's heart, creating a tangled map of unconscious journeys. [183] Meren had spent seventeen years charting these intersections, and now she could sew them together into something deliberate. [200]

Tonight she carried the storybook illustration plate, the only inheritance she truly treasured. [213] It depicted the labyrinth as it had been imagined centuries ago: flooded with moonlit water, whales passing through the widest corridors, children swimming alongside creatures that had no names. [241] The image was hauntingly optimistic, painted by someone who believed the labyrinth would always be full of wonder rather than emptiness. [262]

That artist had been wrong, but Meren did not hold wrongness against hope. [276]

She positioned herself at the convergence point where three sleepwalking paths overlapped. [288] A young man passed first, his fingers trailing the canyon wall, leaving invisible traces. [302] Then an elderly woman, humming a song from a country that no longer existed. [317] Finally, a child whose path Meren had never mapped before, wandering with the specific purpose that only dreamers possess. [335]

Meren began to sew. [339]

Her needle was carved from the bone of the last creature to die when the waters retreated. [357] Her thread was spun from the hair of every sleepwalker who had ever walked this labyrinth, freely given, collected from the stones where it caught and snagged. [386] She stitched the overlapping paths together, binding the unconscious journeys into a single coherent route through the maze. [404]

The precedents she broke were ancient. [410] Tradition held that the labyrinth existed to confuse, to separate the worthy from the unworthy, to make the journey toward the center an ordeal rather than an invitation. [438] Previous weavers had maintained these boundaries, strengthening the walls, sealing the shortcuts. [451] They believed the labyrinth's purpose was to filter pilgrims through suffering. [463]

But Meren had seen too much ruin to worship it. [473] She had watched children sob at dead ends, elderly pilgrims collapse in corridors they could not escape, desperate souls give up entirely on reaching the sacred center. [499] The labyrinth had become a monument to cruelty dressed in tradition. [511]

Her grandmother would have called this desecration. [518] Meren called it reverence of a different kind. [527]

The stitches held. [530] The overlapping paths merged into a single thread of intention, a route that would guide sleepwalkers and waking travelers alike through the red stone passages without endless suffering. [557] The journey would still be long. [563] The center would still demand something from those who sought it. [574] But the path would no longer punish for punishment's sake. [584]

Meren held up the illustration plate and studied it in the starlight. [597] The painted labyrinth glowed with possibility, whales and children and water all tangled together in joyful chaos. [614] The artist had imagined a labyrinth that welcomed rather than rejected. [626] Perhaps that vision had never existed, but Meren could sew its echo into the stone. [642]

Dawn approached. [644] The sleepwalkers drifted back toward their homes, following the new path she had created, moving easily through passages that had trapped their ancestors. [667] They would not remember this journey, but their feet would carry the knowledge forward. [683]

Meren touched the canyon wall, feeling the ancient grooves where water had once polished the stone smooth. [700] The tide pools would remain empty. [706] The whales would not return. [711] Some ruins could not be mended, only accepted with grace. [722]

But a labyrinth could become a garden instead of a prison. [734] A path could honor the past while refusing to perpetuate its cruelty. [748] And a weaver, working through the empty hours, could transform broken precedents into something that felt almost like orchid solace: delicate, rare, and quietly alive against the red stone. [778]

She gathered her thread and needle and climbed toward the canyon rim, where the sun was just beginning to paint the walls in shades of copper and rose. [807]

I need to trim this slightly to stay within the 600-800 word limit. Let me revise:
