The shrine had been carved three centuries ago by monks who believed ice held memory. [15] Now Mira knelt within it, surrounded by candle flames that painted the glacier walls in amber and shadow, their light borrowed starlight reflected through frozen depths. [41]

She placed the melted snow globe before her, its glass warped into something that resembled a teardrop. [56] Inside, the water had long ago escaped, leaving only the miniature ship encased in clouded resin—a relic from the wreck of the Celestine, which had gone down with forty-three souls aboard. [88]

Mira was what the coastal villages called a wreck-diver ghost whisperer, someone who descended into sunken vessels not for gold but for voices. [110] The dead who drowned violently rarely rested. [118] They scattered themselves across the dreams of the living, appearing as strangers in the background, faces half-glimpsed in crowds that shouldn't exist. [138]

Tonight, she would analyze the cameo appearances that had been plaguing fishermen for months—phantom passengers standing on dream-docks, watching, waiting. [156] The villagers had brought her their sleep journals, desperate for answers. [167] Three different dreamers had seen the same woman: pale, dark-haired, clutching something round to her chest. [182]

Mira closed her eyes and let the cold seep into her. [193] The shrine's ice served as a window of connection, thinning the veil between the breathing world and the silent one below. [216] She had learned long ago that ghosts didn't haunt places—they haunted moments, slipping through the margins of consciousness where the living forgot to guard their minds. [242]

The dreams came to her like photographs shuffled out of order. [253] She saw the fisherman Marcus standing on a pier that didn't exist, and behind him, a woman in a gray dress pressed against a railing. [277] In another dream—this one belonging to the innkeeper's daughter—the same woman sat in a crowded theater, her face turned toward the dreamer with desperate intensity. [303]

Mira traced the patterns. [307] The woman wasn't haunting randomly. [312] She was choosing witnesses, people whose minds held small cracks of grief or guilt, windows she could peer through from the other side. [333]

The snow globe had belonged to her. [340] Mira knew this now, feeling the psychic residue that clung to warped glass. [353] The woman's name surfaced like a bubble from deep water: Elise Varnum, traveling to meet a fiance she'd never reach. [372]

But there was more. [376] Mira weaves truth carefully, knowing that exposure demanded precision. [385] The dead didn't always want justice—sometimes they wanted absolution, or confession, or simply to be seen before they let go. [404]

She pushed deeper into the collected dreams and found what Elise had been trying to show them. [420] The Celestine hadn't struck a reef by accident. [428] In the margins of Marcus's dream, hidden behind the phantom woman, stood a man with familiar features—the current harbormaster's father, young and alive, extinguishing the lighthouse lamp. [455]

The truth was a knife, and Mira had to decide where to cut. [468]

She opened her eyes. [472] The candles had burned low, their light now barely reaching the shrine's curved ceiling. [486] The melted snow globe sat between her palms, warm despite the cold, as if Elise's hands still cradled it from the other side of glass and time. [514]

Mira understood the motivation that bound them together: to salvage something pure from the wreckage. [528] For Elise, it was acknowledgment—not revenge, but recognition that her death had been a theft, not an accident. [546] For Mira, it was the knowledge that some windows of connection, once opened, could offer passage both ways. [563]

She would expose the truth to the village council at dawn. [574] She would speak of lighthouse lamps and insurance claims and a young man's greed that had calcified into an old man's silence. [596] The harbormaster's father had died years ago, beyond punishment, but his son still walked the docks built on drowned foundations. [617]

The ghost needed witnesses. [621] Mira would give her forty-three. [626]

She wrapped the snow globe in cloth and stood, her breath crystallizing in the shrine's sacred cold. [642] Above her, through layers of ancient ice, stars she couldn't see still burned. [655] Their light reached her only secondhand, filtered through frozen water and the dreams of strangers, but it reached her nonetheless. [674]

That was enough. [677]

That had always been enough. [682]

Mira carried the dead woman's treasure out of the glacier and into the waiting dark, where morning was already beginning to pale the eastern sky. [706] Behind her, the candles guttered and died, and the shrine returned to its centuries-long silence, patient as only ice can be. [729]

The window remained open. [733]

Elise Varnum, at last, stepped through. [739]
