The queen had not believed in omens for seventeen years, not since her coronation had stripped belief from her like wet silk. [26]

Yet here she stood at the base of the ridge, her fingers wrapped around cold stone, preparing to climb toward the ember grotto that pulsed with dying light above the clouds. [56] The final warning had come three nights ago, whispered by her own reflection in the mirror: ascend or drown in what you refuse to see. [79] She had ignored the first six warnings, dismissed them as fever dreams brought on by too much wine and too little sleep. [99] But the seventh had shown her something that made her blood crystallize in her veins—her daughter's face, dissolving into starlight that bled red across an endless sky. [124]

The climb was treacherous, each handhold slick with condensation from the clouds that gathered below like curious ghosts. [141] Her guards had begged her not to go, had threatened to resign, had wept at her feet. [157] She had dismissed them with a voice softly commanding, the way one speaks to children who cannot understand the weight of maternal terror. [177] The recurring dreams had started six months ago, always the same: the cobalt grotto, the bleeding starlight, her daughter reaching for something the queen could not see. [202]

Halfway up, her muscles screaming, she paused on a narrow ledge where the air thinned to silk. [219] Below her, the kingdom spread like a tapestry of fields and rivers, beautiful and utterly meaningless if her daughter's fate remained tangled in nightmare. [241] She had been disenchanted with her crown for years, had worn it like a wound she refused to acknowledge. [260] But this pilgrimage was not about duty to the realm—it was about the only thread of love that still bound her to anything worth saving. [284]

The ember grotto revealed itself as she crested the final ridge, its walls glowing with veins of orange and gold that pulsed like a sleeping heartbeat. [309] But beyond it, connected by a natural bridge of obsidian stone, waited the cobalt grotto she had seen a thousand times in sleep. [332] Its depths shimmered with impossible blue light, and the clouds below formed a floor of silver that swirled with lacy menace, beautiful and hungry. [356]

She crossed the bridge, her breath catching as she entered the cobalt chamber. [369] The walls were lined with crystalline formations that seemed to drink the darkness, and at the center stood a basin filled with something that looked like liquid night. [394] The bleeding starlight descended from an opening in the ceiling—actual light, she realized, filtering through some cosmic wound in the sky itself, dripping red and luminous into the basin. [423]

"You came." [425]

The voice belonged to a woman who stepped from the shadows, ancient and young simultaneously, her eyes the same blue as the grotto walls. [446] "Your daughter carries my blood in her veins. [454] A gift given three generations ago, a debt now coming due." [465]

The queen's hands curled into fists. [471] "I came to unravel the mystery, not to bargain." [481]

"They are the same thing," the woman said, gesturing to the basin. [493] "The starlight bleeds because something in your lineage is awakening. [503] Your daughter will either become what I am—a guardian of the threshold between worlds—or the threshold will collapse, and both worlds will die." [524]

The queen approached the basin, her reflection fractured across its surface. [535] "And if I refuse?" [538]

"You cannot refuse what has already begun." [545]

A flutter of movement caught the queen's eye—tiny lights rising from the basin's depths. [558] Not lights. [560] Fireflies. [561] The first fireflies of summer, impossibly born from liquid starlight. [570]

The ancient woman drew close, and together they watched the emergence, sharing an exhale that felt like surrender and beginning at once. [590] "She will need a teacher," the woman said. [598] "Someone who understands what it means to wear a crown that no longer fits." [612]

The queen understood then. [616] The dreams had not been warnings—they had been invitations. [625] Her disenchantment with her mortal throne had been preparation for something far stranger, far more demanding. [640]

She would climb down from this ridge carrying not answers but a new kind of purpose, softly commanding a fate she had never chosen but would finally, fully embrace. [668] The bleeding starlight continued its descent, painting her upturned face in shades of crimson and gold. [683] Above the clouds, in the space between worlds, the disenchanted queen began to believe in omens once more. [700]
