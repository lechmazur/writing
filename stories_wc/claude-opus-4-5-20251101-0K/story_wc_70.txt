The lightning collection tower stood dark against the amber sky, its copper spires reaching toward clouds that had already spent their charge. [24] After the city-wide blackout, Mira found herself alone at her post, the toll gate frozen open in the absence of power. [46] She had always loved this time of day, when the light turned thick as honey and the world seemed suspended between states. [68]

Travelers rarely came to the tower anymore, not since the automated systems failed. [81] But Mira stayed because someone had to count what passed through, had to mark the boundary between the storm fields and the city below. [104] She preserved wonder in routine, finding meaning in each tally mark, each stranger's face. [118]

A woman approached the gate carrying a lacquer box, its surface catching the nectar dusk in ripples of gold and crimson. [138] The box hummed faintly, vibrating with something alive inside. [148]

"The toll is suspended," Mira said, though she hadn't meant to speak at all. [162] The words came unbidden, as they always did when truth demanded release. [174] She had been this way since childhood, involuntarily truthful in moments that mattered most. [187] "But you knew that already. You came specifically because the power failed." [199]

The woman stopped, eyes narrowing. [204] "How did you know?" [208]

"I don't know how I know things," Mira admitted, the honesty spilling from her like water through broken glass. [224] "I only know that I cannot lie about them once I do." [236]

The humming from the lacquer box grew louder, more distressed. [246] The woman set it down on Mira's toll counter with trembling hands. [258]

"My drone beehive," she said. [263] "The electromagnetic pulse during the storm corrupted their navigation protocols. They can't find their way back to the hive mind. Without the tower's charge to recalibrate them, they'll burn out by midnight." [295]

Mira watched the box pulse with frantic light through its seams. [306] Hundreds of mechanical bees, confused and dying, desperate for a signal that no longer existed. [321]

"You're lying about something," Mira said, unable to stop herself. [332] "Not about the bees. About why you care." [341]

The woman's composure cracked. [345] "They were my daughter's project. Before she—" [353] She couldn't finish. [356]

Mira reached beneath her counter and retrieved a matchbox, old and worn. [368] She had carried it for twelve years, since her own mother had pressed it into her palm at a different toll gate, in a different life. [393]

"Open it," she said. [397]

Inside, written in faded ink on a slip of paper, was a cryptic riddle: What feeds the lightning but never burns? [416] What keeps the dark but holds no urn? [424]

The woman read it twice, confusion clouding her grief. [433] "I don't understand." [436]

"Neither did I, for years." [441] Mira pointed to the tower's base, where a small copper door had been installed long before automation claimed the sky. [459] "The answer is memory. The tower doesn't just collect lightning. It stores echoes of every charge, every storm. My mother built the first collection chamber." [485]

She could reveal this now because the truth insisted upon it. [496] "There's enough residual charge in the memory banks to recalibrate your bees. Enough to bring them home." [513]

The woman clutched the matchbox like a relic. [521] "Why would you help me? You don't know me." [530]

"Because I know what it means to carry something that belonged to someone you've lost." [545] Mira gestured toward the lacquer box, toward the desperate hum that was already weakening. [559] "And because wonder shouldn't die just because the lights go out." [570]

Together they descended into the tower's depths, where phosphorescent moss lined walls that remembered a thousand storms. [586] The woman connected her lacquer box to the old terminals, and slowly, beautifully, the mechanical bees began to synchronize. [604] Their distressed buzzing resolved into a harmony, a song of navigation rediscovered. [616]

In the nectar dusk filtering through ancient vents, Mira watched the bees spiral upward in perfect formation, returning to the hive mind that awaited them somewhere in the darkened city. [646]

The woman wept silently, and Mira stood beside her without speaking, because some truths required no words at all. [666]

Later, the woman left without paying a toll that had never been owed. [679] But she left the matchbox on Mira's counter, the riddle answered, ready to guide the next lost traveler through the dark. [699]

Mira returned to her post as the first stars emerged, marking another passage in her ledger, preserving the wonder that lived in the space between storms. [726]
