The ivy had swallowed Platform 3 entirely, green tendrils threading through shattered windows and wrapping the rusted benches in living shrouds. [24] Maya Chen arrived at the disused railway station precisely because no one would think to look for her there. [42] As a disaster-relief logistician, she had spent fifteen years appearing exactly where catastrophe demanded, then vanishing before gratitude could pin her down. [63]

She sat on a moss-covered trunk and pulled the fragment of moon rock from her pocket, turning it beneath the fractured skylights. [84] The sample had been stolen, technically, though she preferred to think of it as borrowed from a collapsed research station in Nepal. [105] Dr. Yuen had pressed it into her palm while the aftershocks still rattled the mountainside, whispering, "Find Dr. Okonkwo. Tell him the reciprocity protocol is ready." [131]

Maya had spent three months tracking this Okonkwo through improbable rumor chains that wound through relief camps and field hospitals. [150] A nurse in Bangladesh mentioned a peculiar neurologist who treated earthquake survivors. [162] A water engineer in Honduras recalled a man obsessed with oxytocin research who fixed their generator in exchange for satellite phone access. [181] A pilot in the Philippines swore she'd flown someone matching his description to an abandoned train station in the English countryside. [201]

Now Maya waited, desperately jocular even with herself. [209] "Well," she announced to a curious fox watching from the ticket booth, "if he doesn't show, at least I've found an excellent place to start a vineyard." [238]

The fox blinked and disappeared. [243]

"That's rather rude," said a voice behind her. [251] "I thought we were having a moment." [258]

Dr. Emmanuel Okonkwo was smaller than she'd imagined, with silver-streaked locs and eyes that catalogued her within seconds. [275] He wore a gardener's apron over his clothes and carried pruning shears like weapons. [289]

"The ivy needs managing," he explained, gesturing at the station. [299] "It's quite hostile without regular negotiation." [306]

Maya stood, brushing lichen from her jacket. [313] "Dr. Yuen sent me. He said you'd understand reciprocity." [323]

Okonkwo's expression shifted from amused to intense. [330] "You have the sample?" [334]

She held out the moon rock fragment, and he received it with trembling hands. [348] "Fifteen years," he breathed. [352] "Fifteen years of favors traded through disasters, and finally the last piece arrives." [365]

"I don't understand," Maya admitted. [370] "What is the reciprocity protocol?" [375]

Okonkwo led her through a door strangled with vines into what had once been the stationmaster's office. [391] Inside, improbably, a laboratory hummed with equipment. [398] Charts covered the walls, mapping neural pathways and social networks with equal precision. [410]

"Loneliness," he said, "is the disaster no one calls me to fix." [422] He placed the moon rock under a microscope. [430] "Dr. Yuen discovered that certain lunar minerals can catalyze a compound that repairs the neural pathways damaged by chronic isolation. [449] But harvesting enough requires a network of people willing to give without expectation of return." [464]

Maya laughed, the sound genuinely surprised. [470] "So you built a favor economy through disaster zones." [479]

"Bound by reciprocity," he confirmed. [484] "Everyone who helped transport this sample received something they needed first. [494] The nurse got antibiotics for her village. [501] The engineer got his daughter airlifted to surgery. [509] The pilot got her brother found in the rubble. [518] No one knew they were part of something larger." [527]

"Polite anarchy," Maya murmured. [531] "Everyone breaking rules for each other." [537]

Okonkwo smiled for the first time. [543] "Precisely. The cure for loneliness isn't a pill. [551] It's the network itself. [555] The compound simply reminds the brain what connection feels like long enough for people to seek it again." [571]

Maya watched him work, understanding finally why she'd spent her career slipping between tragedies. [584] She'd been running from the very thing she craved, helping others connect while keeping herself elusive. [600]

"When does the story change?" she asked quietly. [608]

Okonkwo looked up from his microscope. [614] "When you stop running, Ms. Chen." [620] He gestured at the ivy pressing against the windows, patient and persistent. [631] "This station was abandoned thirty years ago. [638] The plants never stopped reaching toward it anyway." [646]

Outside, the fox had returned with a companion. [654] Maya watched them settle together in the ticket booth's shadow. [664]

"I could help distribute the compound," she offered, the words unfamiliar and terrifying. [677] "I know how to move through catastrophes." [684]

"I know," Okonkwo replied, still smiling. [690] "That's why you're here. [694] Someone started a rumor you were exactly the person I needed." [705]

Maya laughed again, the sound less desperate now, more like an opening door. [718] The ivy crept another inch toward the light. [727] Somewhere in the distance, a train whistle echoed, impossible and perfect, as though the old station remembered what it was for. [747]

She was bound now, finally, by the gentle chains of reciprocity. [759] It felt, remarkably, like freedom. [764]
