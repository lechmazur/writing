Father Marcus pressed his thumb against the loop pedal, and the cathedral fell into a silence so complete it felt like decoration itself. [24] The dimensional anchor hummed beneath the flagstones, its ancient mechanisms the only reason this pocket of reality hadn't collapsed into the void pressing against every wall. [50] He had three minutes before the possession completed—three minutes before Sister Elena became something else entirely. [65]

She knelt at the altar, her body trembling as shadows writhed beneath her skin. [78] The entity hadn't finished threading itself through her consciousness, not yet. [89] There was still time to reach her, to illuminate the hidden assumptions that had made her vulnerable in the first place. [107]

Marcus stepped forward, his bare feet cold against stone worn smooth by centuries of penitents. [121] In his left hand, he clutched an artist's palette—a gift from his seminary days, now bearing only a single color: ash gray, the hue of unraveled stillness. [147] He had mixed it himself from the dust of collapsed dimensions, the residue of realities that had forgotten how to hold together. [168]

"Elena," he said, his voice muffled yet strangely clear in the acoustic void. [181] "Do you remember what you told me about faith?" [190]

She lifted her head, and her eyes flickered between brown and something ancient and yellow. [204] "I told you... I told you it was certainty." [213]

"Was that faith, or was that fear wearing faith's clothing?" [223] Marcus circled slowly, his words deliberate rhetorical tools designed to plumb the depths of her doubt. [237] He pressed the loop pedal again, and his previous question echoed back, layering: "Was that faith, or was that fear wearing faith's clothing?" [257]

The entity hissed. [260] It hated questions—they created spaces where its influence couldn't reach. [270]

"You assumed certainty protected you," Marcus continued, building his argument like a cathedral of logic. [284] "But certainty is a closed door. And closed doors..." [293]

"...can be broken down," Elena whispered, her own voice threading through. [303] "I thought if I believed hard enough, nothing could enter." [313]

"Yet what is a fortress that never questions its walls? Is it not simply a prison that calls itself safe?" [331] Marcus dipped his finger in the ash-gray paint and began drawing symbols on the floor—geometric patterns that anchored dimensional boundaries. [351] Each stroke decorated the silence between his words, making the emptiness itself a barrier against the encroaching presence. [368]

The loop pedal cycled his questions again, and he layered new ones atop them: "What did you assume about worthiness? About who deserves protection? About what darkness wants?" [395]

Elena's hands clutched her temples. [400] "It said... it said I was empty. That my doubts had hollowed me out." [413]

"And you assumed emptiness was weakness." [419] Marcus knelt before her, his voice cutting through the muffled clarity like a bell wrapped in cloth. [434] "But emptiness is simply space. Space for questions. Space for growth. Space the entity needed you to fear so you'd fill it with false certainty instead." [459]

The shadows beneath her skin began to writhe more violently. [469] The possession was fighting back, but it was also losing ground. [480] Every assumption Marcus illuminated was a thread pulled from its weaving. [491]

He pressed the palette against the floor, completing the anchor pattern. [502] The dimensional stabilizers beneath the cathedral resonated with the gray dust, and suddenly the boundaries between here and the void grew solid again. [524]

"You decorated your soul with silence because you feared your own questions would make you weak," Marcus said, his final rhetorical strike aimed at the entity's foundation. [548] "But what if silence is strength? What if questions are armor? What if the thing that makes us vulnerable to darkness is not doubt, but the assumption that doubt is sin?" [579]

Elena screamed—and then laughed, tears streaming down her face. [589] The yellow faded from her eyes. [594] The shadows dissolved like morning mist. [600]

The loop pedal played one last echo: "What if doubt is sin?" [611]

And in the ringing silence that followed, the question hung unanswered—because Marcus knew that some questions weren't meant to be answered. [631] They were meant to be lived. [636]

He helped Elena to her feet, and together they stood in the dimensional anchor's steady hum, two people who had learned that unraveled stillness wasn't destruction. [660] It was the space between certainties where truth could finally breathe. [671]

The possession had failed because it had assumed fear. [680] And assumptions, Marcus had always believed, were the first thread to pull when unraveling darkness. [694]
