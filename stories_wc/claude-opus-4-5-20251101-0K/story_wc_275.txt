The tower fell on a Tuesday, and by Wednesday, Mira had already begun teaching the roses how to forgive. [20]

She knelt in the copper-tinted soil of the glass-domed enclosure, her father's old bounty hunter insignia buried somewhere beneath her knees, forgotten like the violence it represented. [46] The dome arched above her, filtering the harsh wasteland sun into something gentler, something that wouldn't scorch the delicate petals of her desert roses. [69] Outside, smoke still curled from the distant ruins of the Sovereignty Tower, that monument to order that had collapsed under the weight of its own cruelty. [93]

Mira pressed her palm against the stem of a young rose, closing her eyes. [107] She was senselessly perceptive, her mother used to say, able to feel the subtle tremors of emotion in living things that others dismissed as imagination. [130] Now she channeled that gift deliberately, inculcating plants with values she wished the world would learn. [145] Patience. [146] Mercy. [147] The quiet strength of choosing not to strike back. [156]

The rose's thorns softened slightly beneath her touch, or perhaps she only imagined it. [170] Either way, the practice centered her, weaving continuity through chaos in the only way she knew how. [186]

Her father had never understood. [191] Garrett Stone had hunted men across three territories, collected bounties that paid for this very dome, this sanctuary she now tended alone. [212] He'd wanted her to inherit his rifle, his instincts, his willingness to do what was necessary. [227] Instead, she'd inherited only his stubbornness, turning it toward gentler purposes. [238]

She reached into her apron pocket and withdrew the airship ballast sandbag scrap, worn soft from years of handling. [255] It had arrived with her father's final effects after the Sovereignty executed him for refusing to hunt refugees. [271] Even the bounty hunter had found his limit, it seemed. [282] Even he had learned, too late, that some prey deserved to run free. [295]

Mira had sewn the scrap into a small pouch, filling it with rose seeds. [310] She carried it everywhere now, a reminder that weight could be released, that descent could be chosen, that the things meant to keep airships grounded could be transformed into vessels of new growth. [344]

The dome's glass panels caught the afternoon light, creating what she called the tranquil blaze, that paradox of fire and peace that defined her existence. [369] Flames had taken the tower. [374] Flames had taken so many things. [380] But here, the light burned without consuming, illuminated without destroying. [390]

She moved between the rows, her fingers brushing each plant, reading their small green thoughts. [405] The roses nearest the eastern panel were anxious, sensing the vibrations of distant conflict. [419] Survivors from the tower's fall were fleeing across the wastes, and some would inevitably seek shelter here. [435] Mira would welcome them. [439] She would offer water, shade, and the company of flowers that had learned compassion. [453]

A sound interrupted her meditation, the dome's entrance grinding open. [463] Mira's hand moved instinctively toward the knife at her belt, her father's training surfacing despite everything. [478] But she stopped, chose differently, and instead reached to sheathe the blade more securely, a deliberate rejection of the impulse. [497]

The figure in the doorway was dust-covered and bleeding, a Sovereignty soldier by his uniform, a frightened boy by his eyes. [518]

Mira approached slowly, her perception reading his exhaustion, his shame, his desperate hope that someone might show him kindness he'd never earned. [540] The engraved quiet of the dome wrapped around them both, that carved-out silence she'd cultivated over years, a peace so intentional it felt etched into the very air. [569]

She guided him to a bench among the roses, pressed water into his trembling hands, and began cleaning his wounds with cloth soaked in rosewater. [595] He wept, and she let him, understanding that some falls took longer than others. [611]

Outside, the world burned and rebuilt and burned again. [621] Factions would rise from the tower's ashes. [628] Violence would beget violence in endless, exhausting cycles. [636] But here, in this glass-domed sanctuary, Mira continued her quiet revolution, teaching roses and soldiers alike that growth required no conquest, that strength could mean surrender, that the most radical act in a world of chaos was simply to tend something beautiful and refuse to let it die. [687]

She touched the sandbag scrap in her pocket, thinking of her father, of weight released, of seeds waiting to become gardens. [709]

The soldier slept among the roses, and Mira returned to her work, patient as petals, steady as roots drinking deep from hidden wells. [733] The tower had fallen. [737] But the dome stood, blazing tranquilly in the desert light, a small bright promise that continuity was possible, that peace was a practice, that even the bounty hunter's daughter could choose what she would hunt. [772]

And what she hunted was hope. [778]
