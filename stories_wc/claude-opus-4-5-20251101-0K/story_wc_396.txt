The lighthouse orchard clung to the cliff's edge like a prayer refusing to be forgotten, its gnarled apple trees dusted with salt spray from the ice floes that groaned and shifted in the waters below. [36] Kira moved between the frozen rows, her breath crystallizing in the pre-dawn air, the shadows that clung to her uniform rippling with each step as though alive. [62] She was a peacekeeper, yes, but the shadows that laced her coat and pooled at her boots marked her as something more dangerous—a vessel for the darkness she'd chosen to carry so others wouldn't have to. [96]

In her pocket, wrapped in cloth, rested a broken crystal ball fragment no larger than her thumb. [113] It had belonged to the last oracle of the northern territories before the ice had swallowed everything she'd prophesied. [130] Now it was worthless for divination, cracked and clouded, yet Kira kept it close like a splinter she couldn't remove. [149]

The lighthouse keeper had summoned her three days ago with a message that made no sense: "The mirrors remember what we've forgotten." [169] She'd traveled across shifting ice bridges that could vanish in an hour, through abandoned settlements where frost had claimed the furniture mid-meal, all because something in those words had resonated with the calmly intuitive sense that had guided her through seventeen years of keeping peace in lands that wanted only war. [219]

She found him in the lighthouse's ground floor, surrounded by salvage from a vintage store that had once operated in the drowned village below. [243] Mirrors of every size leaned against stone walls, their silver backing spotted with age, their frames carved with flowers that hadn't bloomed in these latitudes for a century. [271]

"You're the anomaly they whisper about," the keeper said without turning. [282] His voice was steady, almost reverent. [288] "The one who walks with shadows but serves the light." [298]

"I'm a peacekeeper," Kira replied. [303] "Nothing more." [305]

"Then why did the fragment call you here?" [313]

She had no answer for that. [319] The crystal piece had grown warm against her hip the moment she'd read his message, and hadn't cooled since. [338]

The keeper gestured to the mirrors. [344] "Look." [345]

Kira approached the nearest one, a tall oval framed in tarnished brass. [357] Her reflection stared back, but wrong—younger, unmarked by shadow, laughing at something beyond the frame. [372] In the next mirror, she saw herself kneeling beside a wounded enemy, binding his wounds while her own blood dripped into the snow. [393] Another showed her standing before a council, speaking words she couldn't hear, watching hard faces soften. [408]

"Glimpses," the keeper explained. [412] "Every act of courage you've performed, every time you chose mercy over expedience. [424] The mirrors hold them." [428]

"Why?" [429]

"Because you need to reconstitute what you've lost." [437] He took the crystal fragment from her pocket before she could protest, holding it up to catch the light from a dozen reflections. [458] "You've given so much empathy to others that you've forgotten how to feel it for yourself. [474] The shadows grow because you feed them your own compassion, believing you deserve none." [488]

Kira watched as the fragment began to glow, drawing threads of light from each mirror—each remembered kindness, each courageous choice that had marked her as an anomaly among peacekeepers who'd grown cold. [519] The warmth spread through her chest, and for the first time in years, the shadows around her didn't feel like chains. [540]

"To map empathy onto action," she whispered, understanding now. [549] "I have to include myself in that map." [557]

The keeper nodded during the weighted breath before reply, letting the silence hold its own meaning. [571] "The ice floes shift," he finally said. [578] "The world changes. [581] But someone must remember that peace isn't just the absence of conflict—it's the presence of connection." [595]

Kira took the crystal back, now whole in her palm, glowing with borrowed light. [609] Below the cliff, the ice groaned and rearranged itself, ancient patterns forming and dissolving. [623] The apple trees stood witness, their bare branches reaching toward a sky that was beginning to lighten. [639]

She would return to her work, to the borders and the broken places where her shadow-touched presence kept violence at bay. [659] But she would carry these glimpses with her now—proof that courage wasn't the absence of fear or the denial of self. [680] It was choosing, again and again, to extend the circle of care outward while finally leaving room for herself within it. [700]

The lighthouse beam swept across the orchard as dawn approached, and Kira walked back through the frozen trees, her shadows trailing behind her like loyal hounds rather than hungry ghosts. [730] The crystal pulsed gently against her heart, a compass pointing toward every act of mercy yet to come. [749]
