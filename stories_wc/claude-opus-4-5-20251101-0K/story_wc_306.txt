The lighthouse keeper called herself a conscience for hire, though she preferred to think of it as lending clarity to those who had misplaced their own. [28]

She arrived at the breezy lighthouse at dawn, just as the horizon split itself between night's retreat and morning's advance. [47] The structure groaned against the coastal wind, its whitewashed walls catching the first amber light while shadows still pooled in the corners. [68] This was her preferred hour for appointments—after the campfire's last spark dies somewhere on the beach below, when the world exists in that liminal space between conviction and uncertainty. [95]

Her client was already waiting inside, a young woman named Sera who clutched something wrapped in cloth against her chest. [113] Sera's eyes held the particular desperation of someone who had made a decision but couldn't live with it. [131]

"You come recommended," Sera said, her voice thin as sea glass. [142] "They say you can tell people what they should do." [153]

The keeper smiled, sincerely insincere in the way all professionals of moral commerce must be. [168] "I tell people what they already know. [175] The fee is for making it bearable to hear." [184]

She gestured toward the narrow staircase that spiraled up toward the light. [196] "Come. [197] My office is above." [201]

The lighthouse's crown was a cathedral of wind and glass, where seventeen wind chimes hung from the iron frame surrounding the dormant lamp. [223] Each chime was different—copper, shell, bone, glass—and each sang its own interpretation of the morning breeze. [240] This was her method: deciphering wind chime selections to read the questions clients couldn't bring themselves to ask aloud. [258]

"Sit," she instructed, positioning Sera beneath the copper chimes. [268] "And show me what you've brought." [274]

Sera unwrapped the cloth with trembling fingers, revealing a hollow mirror shard no larger than her palm. [291] Its surface was dark, reflecting nothing, though its edges caught the light in fragments. [306]

"It belonged to my sister," Sera whispered. [313] "Before she disappeared. [316] I found it in her room, and I need to know if I should search for her or let her go." [336]

The keeper studied the shard, then listened as the copper chimes above Sera's head began their chorus—a minor key, hesitant, circling back on itself. [360] Doubt. [361] The cloak of doubt wrapped itself around this girl so completely she had forgotten she was wearing it. [378]

"You've already searched," the keeper observed. [384] "You've searched for months. [388] What you want now is permission to stop." [396]

Sera's face crumpled. [399] "Is that selfish?" [402]

The keeper walked to the window where the sea stretched endlessly beneath ribbons of cloud. [415] She had learned long ago that certainty was a trap, that the people who paid for her services wanted absolution when what they needed was complexity. [440] Her true motivation in this work was to welcome nuance into certainty, to unhook her clients from the desperate need for clean answers. [463]

"Your sister left this mirror deliberately hollow," she said finally. [473] "She removed her reflection from it before she left. [482] Does that tell you anything?" [487]

Sera stared at the shard. [492] "She didn't want to be found." [498]

"Perhaps. [499] Or perhaps she wanted you to stop looking in mirrors for her and start looking at the world she left behind. [520] There's a difference between abandoning someone and accepting their choice to leave." [532]

The bone chimes stirred now, adding their lower register to the copper's doubt. [545] Grief, the keeper recognized. [549] But also relief, creeping in like tide through sand. [558]

"I can unhook you from this guilt," the keeper said, turning back to face her client. [575] "But only if you're willing to hold two truths at once: that you love your sister, and that her path is not yours to walk." [600]

Sera lifted the hollow mirror shard to the growing light. [610] For a moment, the keeper saw something flicker in its dark surface—not a reflection, but possibility. [627]

"Keep it," the keeper advised. [632] "Let it remind you that emptiness isn't always absence. [641] Sometimes it's just space waiting to be filled differently." [650]

Sera wrapped the shard carefully, and when she descended the spiral stairs, her shoulders sat differently—still burdened, but no longer crushed. [673] The keeper watched her go, then turned back to her wind chimes as they settled into silence. [690]

This was her protected vulnerability: wearing other people's doubts like borrowed coats, then hanging them back on their hooks before they became her own. [712] She was sincerely insincere because sincerity alone would break her, and insincerity alone would make her useless. [730]

The lighthouse lamp would sleep until evening, but she would remain, waiting for the next soul who needed permission to be uncertain. [752] The wind chimes stirred again, speaking of someone approaching the path below. [765]

Another conscience for hire, another dawn. [771]
