Mira stitched another spiral arm into the silk, her needle catching lamplight as autumn winds rattled the cobalt dome above. [22] The observatory had stood for three centuries, its blue-tinted walls absorbing starlight and secrets in equal measure. [38] She hummed a nonsense tune, the kind that made the astronomers dismiss her as simple, which was precisely what she needed them to believe. [58]

"Still embroidering your silly pictures?" [63] Admiral Voss descended the spiral staircase, his medals clinking against brass buttons. [74] He never looked at her work closely enough to see that each thread-galaxy matched the naval fleet positions she overheard during their midnight observations. [96]

"The stars tell stories, my lord," Mira said, letting her voice carry the vacant sweetness of a fool. [114] "I just listen." [117]

Voss snorted and continued past, joining the cluster of officers gathered around the great telescope. [131] Their whispers echoed against the dome's copper ribs, fragmenting into syllables she collected like scattered pearls. [146] Before the coup, they grew careless with their conspiracies, confident that power would soon render caution obsolete. [162]

The eternal candle burned at the center of her worktable, its flame having passed unbroken from embroiderer to embroiderer for seven generations. [182] Mira's grandmother had pressed the brass holder into her hands with dying fingers, whispering that the flame remembered every conversation it had witnessed. [203] Superstition, perhaps, but Mira found that watching the flame's subtle flickers helped her synchronize the fragments she gathered into coherent patterns. [222]

Tonight, the flame leaned east, toward the cluster of conspirators. [232]

She listened for the unheard stories, the ones buried beneath official proclamations and sanctioned histories. [246] Every court had its chorus of approved voices, but Mira had learned that truth lived in the spaces between words, in the pauses where men swallowed their real intentions. [274] The astronomers thought they studied distant light, but she studied them, mapping the constellation of their treachery. [291]

"The southern fleet will hold position until the signal," one officer murmured. [302] "Then we move simultaneously on the capital and the coastal fortresses." [313]

Mira's needle paused above a dense star cluster she'd been stitching for weeks. [326] She adjusted one thread, shifted another, and suddenly the pattern revealed itself through adjacent possibilities. [340] Each piece of intelligence she'd gathered connected to the next like stepping stones across dark water. [355] The Admiral's nephew controlled the treasury. [361] The Duchess had dismissed her personal guard last week. [370] The new cannon shipments had been redirected without explanation. [379]

She saw it now, the complete conspiracy embroidered across her silken galaxy. [391] Not just a coup, but a purge. [398] The Queen would fall, yes, but so would anyone who might question the new order. [413]

The flame flickered twice, and Mira understood. [420]

She rose, gathering her embroidery frame with deliberate clumsiness, letting her thread spools scatter across the floor. [436] The officers glanced over with familiar contempt as she crawled after rolling silk. [449]

"Careful, little fool," one laughed. [454] "You'll tangle yourself into knots." [459]

"Always do, my lord," she giggled, collecting the last spool from beneath the map table where their battle plans lay spread like an open confession. [481]

The echoed silence of the dome swallowed their voices as Mira retreated to her corner. [496] She had three days before the coup, three days to carry her embroidered evidence through the servants' passages and into hands that could read its warning. [522] Her foolishness was her fortress, her art her cipher. [532]

Outside, autumn leaves spiraled past the cobalt glass like copper coins thrown to fate. [546] The eternal flame burned steady as Mira added the final thread to her galaxy chart, a single red stitch marking the Queen's chamber, surrounded by the converging forces that meant to extinguish it. [580]

But now someone would listen to the unheard story. [589] Someone would see the pattern she had synchronized from whispers and glances and the careless confidence of powerful men. [606]

Mira smiled her fool's smile and began a new panel, already gathering the next constellation of secrets. [622] The flame leaned toward her work approvingly, carrying the weight of seven generations who had listened, watched, and stitched the truth into silk while empires burned around them. [649]

In the cobalt observatory, surrounded by men who charted distant stars while plotting earthly destruction, the embroiderer worked on. [668] Her needle moved like a compass finding north, threading wisdom through the disguise of foolishness, one galaxy at a time. [687]

The silence echoed with all the stories yet to be told. [698]
