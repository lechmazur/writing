The medium's boat slipped between the mangrove roots as the spirits began their evening song, their voices threading through the twisted branches like silver through dark water. [29]

Celeste had come to the labyrinth because she was not yet ready to decide, and the spirits here existed in that same suspended breath between intention and action. [56] Her fingers traced the gargoyle's rainspout shard in her pocket, its edges worn smooth from years of the same unconscious gesture. [73] The piece had broken from her mother's church the night of the accident, and she had kept it without knowing why. [93]

"You carry unsent letters in your blood," the boatman had warned her at the dock. [108] He had looked at her with eyes that saw too much, the way the medium always did when she caught her reflection. [129] She had spent twenty years helping others speak to their dead, channeling messages that bridged impossible distances, yet she had never sent her own. [152]

The mangroves here grew in patterns that defied navigation, but Celeste did not need to navigate. [168] She needed only to wait in the space where her apology hung unspoken, suspended like morning fog over the brackish water. [189] Her mother had died believing Celeste blamed her for the fire that scarred her hands, and Celeste had never corrected that belief. [212]

A spirit materialized beside the boat, its form shifting like heat shimmer, its song a low hum that vibrated in Celeste's chest. [234] "You seek the moment before," it sang, its voice multiple and ancient. [247] "The crossroads before the path was chosen." [254]

"I need to understand why I stayed silent," Celeste said. [264] "Before I can break it." [269]

The spirit gestured toward a clearing where moonlight pooled on the water, impossibly bright for the canopy's density. [286] Celeste knew this light. [290] She had healed in moonlight since childhood, her burns fading each month as the full moon rose, leaving only faint traces by morning. [312] Her mother had called it a gift from the church gargoyles, those stone guardians who watched over their family for generations. [332]

She stepped from the boat onto a platform of tangled roots, and the spirits' song shifted, became the voice of her mother humming over dishes, became the creak of the old church, became the sound of flames. [367]

In the moonlight, condensation formed on the water's surface like breath on winter glass. [382] Words emerged, letter by letter, in the cryptic method Celeste used to channel the dead when voice failed them. [400] But these were not her mother's words. [407]

They were her own, unsent. [412]

"I stayed silent because I was afraid you were right," the condensation spelled. [425] "Afraid that loving you meant becoming you. Afraid that forgiving you meant the fire didn't matter." [441]

The gargoyle shard grew warm against her thigh, and Celeste pulled it free, holding it to the moonlight. [459] In its fractured surface, she saw her mother's hands placing her as an infant into the stone guardian's shadow, praying for protection. [481] She saw her mother pulling her from the burning church, screaming her name. [494] She saw what she had refused to see: the fire had not been carelessness. [507] Her mother had gone back for the shard, for the family's guardian, because she believed it kept Celeste alive. [525]

The spirits' song crescendoed, and Celeste felt twenty years of silence crack inside her like ice in spring thaw. [543]

"Mama," she whispered, and the word held everything: accusation and absolution, grief and gratitude, the fierce tenderness of loving someone whose flaws had shaped you. [567] "I'm sorry I made you die believing I hated you." [578]

The condensation shifted one final time, spelling words in her mother's cadence now: "I knew, little moon. I always knew." [597]

The shard pulsed with moonlight, and Celeste understood that her mother had been waiting here, in this labyrinth where spirits sang and decisions remained unmade, for Celeste to finally evoke the truth between them. [630]

She pressed the shard to her lips, tasting salt and stone and forgiveness. [644]

The spirits carried her unspoken apology outward, their song transforming it into something that could finally reach its destination, twenty years late but no longer silent. [669] Celeste climbed back into the boat, her scarred hands steady on the oars for the first time she could remember. [689]

She had found the moment before deciding, and in that crystalline pause, she had chosen to speak at last. [708]

The mangroves parted before her like a held breath finally released, and the spirits sang her home. [725]
