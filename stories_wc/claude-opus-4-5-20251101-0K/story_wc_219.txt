The rainwashed tower stood against the spring sky like a finger pointing toward questions no one had thought to ask. [22] Mira climbed its worn steps slowly, her boots leaving dusty footprints on stone that centuries of pilgrims had smoothed to a dull shine. [44] She was the last of them to arrive, the final skeptic in a procession of skeptics, all converging on this place after the signal had changed everything. [71]

Three months since first contact, and humanity still hadn't decided whether to celebrate or mourn. [85] The beings from Kepler-442b had sent no ambassadors, no ships, only coordinates—thousands of them, scattered across Earth like seeds thrown by a careless gardener. [108] This tower was one such coordinate. [114] The aliens had marked it as sacred without explaining why, and now pilgrims came, drawn by curiosity or desperation or something they couldn't name. [137]

Mira called it an artificial pilgrimage. [143] She had written papers about manufactured meaning, about how humans would sacralize anything if given permission. [158] Her colleagues at the university had called her academically rebellious, too willing to dismantle comfortable beliefs. [172] Now she climbed these steps to understand why even she felt the pull. [185]

The chamber at the top held five others, strangers who had followed the same coordinates through different paths. [200] Rain streaked the tall windows, casting everything in bronze quiet. [210] No one spoke. [213] They had all learned, in the weeks since arrival, that words felt insufficient here. [226]

On a pedestal at the chamber's center sat a piece of amber the size of a child's fist. [243] Inside it, suspended in golden resin, a fly had been preserved for forty million years. [258] The aliens had specified this object in their transmission, had sent its molecular signature across light-years of void. [274] They wanted humanity to look at it. [281] They wanted humanity to understand something. [287]

Mira approached the amber while the others watched. [295] She had studied chemistry before turning to anthropology, had spent years understanding how molecules bonded and broke apart. [312] The fly amber wasn't valuable by human standards—insects in resin were common enough. [326] But the aliens had chosen it. [331]

She thought about homecoming, about the chemistry of it. [340] How certain smells could transport a person back decades. [349] How the brain stored memory in molecular traces, in the firing of neurons that recognized patterns laid down in childhood. [368] The fly had died forty million years ago, trapped in tree sap that slowly hardened around it. [385] Its home had been a forest that no longer existed, on a continent that had since drifted. [401] Yet here it was, preserved, recognizable, still somehow itself. [410]

The rain softened against the windows. [416] One of the other pilgrims, an elderly man with weathered hands, began to weep silently. [430] Mira understood suddenly what the aliens were trying to say. [440]

They had been watching Earth for a long time. [449] Long enough to see forests rise and fall, species emerge and vanish, continents reshape themselves. [463] They had watched humanity crawl out of Africa and spread across the globe, always searching, always returning, always trying to find the place that felt like the beginning. [489]

The coordinates they sent weren't random. [495] Each one marked a site where something had been preserved against time—a fossil, a cave painting, an ancient tree. [513] Evidence that existence could endure, that home wasn't a place but a continuity, a thread connecting what was to what would be. [534]

Mira touched the amber's cool surface. [540] The fly inside had never known it would become a message, a bridge between worlds. [554] It had simply lived, and died, and remained. [562]

She thought about her own skepticism, how she had spent her career questioning why people needed meaning. [577] Now she understood that the question itself was the answer. [587] The need to understand was the thread, the molecular bond that held consciousness together across the void. [603]

The six pilgrims stood in bronze quiet as spring rain washed the tower clean. [617] They had converged here via dusty footprints left on an overgrown sculpture path, following coordinates sent by beings who understood that every journey home was also a journey forward. [647]

Mira was still a skeptic. [652] But she was luminous now, lit from within by a certainty she had never expected to find. [669] The chemistry of homecoming wasn't about returning to a place. [679] It was about recognizing yourself in the amber of time, preserved and continuing, connected to everything that had ever reached toward the stars. [700]

Outside, the rain stopped. [704] The spring sun broke through clouds, casting the tower's shadow across the overgrown path below. [719] Somewhere, forty-two light-years away, beings waited to learn if their message had been understood. [734]

Mira descended the steps, ready to tell them yes. [744]
