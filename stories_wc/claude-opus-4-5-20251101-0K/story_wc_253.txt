The wind turbines turned slowly above the farmhouse, their shadows sweeping across the kitchen floor like the hands of a broken clock. [24] Mira stood at the counter, her face as empty as the mandate required, though inside she felt the familiar heaviness that citizens no longer acknowledged. [47]

"And now," she announced to the empty room, her voice carrying the theatrical cadence she'd perfected during her years as a performer, "the protagonist approaches the most dangerous task of her morning routine: the washing of dishes." [82]

Her hands moved through soapy water while she narrated. [91] This was the only way she remembered how to exist anymore—transforming the unbearable mundaneness into something she could observe from outside herself. [111]

The Happiness Mandate had passed three years ago, after the Great Mourning had nearly collapsed society. [126] Grief was now a private matter, confined to licensed facilities. [136] Public faces were to remain pleasant, neutral, blank. [145] For former performers like Mira, this came naturally, though it had hollowed her completely. [158]

On the windowsill sat a dried flower bouquet, brown and brittle, the last thing her daughter had picked before the accident that nobody spoke of anymore. [182] Mira wasn't supposed to keep such relics. [190] Grief counselors called them "anchors to darkness." [197] But she couldn't let go, and this made her morally ambiguous in the eyes of the state—someone who chose to remember when forgetting was the law. [222]

"Our heroine retrieves the sacred knife," she narrated, pulling a small blade from the drawer. [237] "She will now whittle the morning's kindling, each stroke a meditation on impermanence." [250]

She took a piece of pine to the porch, where the turbine blades cast their rhythmic shadows. [266] The whittling had become her prayer, the curls of wood falling like the tears she couldn't shed in public. [284] Each cut removed something unnecessary, revealing the shape hidden beneath. [294]

This was how she cultivated lightness in grief—by giving it texture, by narrating it into something bearable. [311] The mandate demanded happiness, but happiness had become impossible. [321] Instead, Mira had discovered something else: a remade hush, a quietness that wasn't the void of suppression but something she had chosen. [342]

A drone passed overhead, its camera eye scanning for signs of public distress. [355] Mira kept her face blank, her movements steady. [364] The wooden figure taking shape beneath her blade looked vaguely human, vaguely small. [376] She didn't let herself acknowledge what she was carving. [385]

"The wood surrenders its secrets," she continued, her theatrical voice carrying across the empty fields. [399] "And our protagonist wonders if she, too, might one day reveal what lies beneath her performance." [415]

The neighboring farms had all been abandoned after the mandate. [425] People moved to the cities where the monitoring was constant but the distractions were plentiful. [439] Mira stayed because the turbines' hum drowned out the silence, and because leaving meant abandoning the dried flowers on her windowsill. [458]

She finished the figure—a small girl with arms outstretched—and placed it among the others on the porch rail. [476] Seventeen figures now, one for each week since she'd begun her secret mourning practice. [490]

"The ritual complete, our heroine returns inside," she narrated, "where she will prepare the evening meal with the solemnity of ancient ceremony." [512]

Inside, she touched the dried bouquet gently, feeling the brittle petals crack slightly under her fingers. [527] The emotional void she presented to the world was her armor, her compliance, her survival. [542] But here, in the shadows of the turbines, she had carved out a space where grief could exist transformed—not as the drowning darkness the state feared, but as something whittled down to its essence. [576]

The mandate called this dangerous. [581] Perhaps it was. [584] But Mira understood something the legislators didn't: you couldn't mandate happiness any more than you could mandate the wind to stop. [602] You could only turn the blades, harness the force, let it power something else. [616]

"And so," she whispered, her blank face reflecting in the kitchen window, "our story continues, one narrated moment at a time, until the performer and the performance become indistinguishable." [646]

Outside, the turbines turned endlessly, and Mira began chopping vegetables with the gravity of someone defusing a bomb. [664] In this remade hush, she had found her rebellion: not joy, not sorrow, but the quiet persistence of continuing. [683] The dried flowers watched from the windowsill, and somewhere beneath her practiced blankness, Mira almost smiled. [699]

Almost. [700]
