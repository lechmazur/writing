The conjurer descended into the cavern orchard after the last cricket had ceased its song, after the orchard grew silent beneath the moon whose pale light filtered through fissures in the limestone ceiling. [37]

Mira had kept her craft secret for seven years now, ever since her brother Theo had vanished into the mountain's depths and returned as neither living nor dead, but simply absent. [65] The villagers called it a blessing that he'd left no body to mourn. [78] She knew better. [81] Ambiguous loss carved stranger wounds than clean grief ever could. [91]

Tonight, she carried her most precious possession: a taxidermist's glass eye pair that had belonged to Theo, salvaged from his abandoned workshop. [112] The eyes were mismatched—one brown, one startlingly green—and he had always joked they represented his divided nature. [130] Now they represented everything she couldn't bury and couldn't keep. [140]

The orchard sprawled before her in impossible beauty, apple trees and pear trees growing from beds of phosphorescent moss, their branches heavy with fruit nourished by the eternal drip of mineral-rich water from stalactites overhead. [173] Each drop fell in precise intervals, a mathematics of sustenance that Mira had spent months charting. [189] She believed—had to believe—that emotion operated by similar hidden formulas. [200]

Her motivation had crystallized the day she realized she couldn't remember Theo's laugh. [212] If she could understand the mathematics of emotion, perhaps she could calculate the exact coordinates of her grief, plot its trajectory, and finally locate its endpoint. [237]

She knelt beside the central stepping stone, a mosaic her brother had laid before his disappearance. [252] Time had chipped its patterns into fragments, but Mira saw meaning in the erosion. [267] The missing tiles formed shapes: a spiral here, a branching tree there. [280] She traced them with her fingertips, reading damage like language. [290]

Via the chipped patterns on the mosaic stepping stone, she began her work. [303] Each absent tile became a variable in her equation. [312] Each remaining fragment, a constant. [317] She had spent three years developing this gently inventive system, refusing the harsh binaries of presence and absence that everyone else accepted. [337]

The glass eyes watched from her palm as she worked, catching the bioluminescent glow. [351] She had tried conventional scrying, traditional conjuring. [358] Nothing had shown her Theo. [362] But tonight she would dovetail two disciplines that had never been joined: the taxidermist's art of preserving what was gone and the conjurer's art of summoning what remained. [390]

She placed the brown eye at the spiral's center, the green eye where the branching tree began. [407] Between them, she traced calculations in the moss with her finger, equations that described not location but feeling. [424] The intensity of Tuesday afternoons when she still expected him home. [435] The volume of silence in rooms he'd occupied. [444] The half-life of hope. [448]

Water dripped from the stalactites in its ancient rhythm. [457] The equations began to glow. [461]

The mosaic shuddered, and something emerged—not Theo, but not nothing either. [473] A shape made of overlapping images: her brother at seven, at fifteen, at twenty-three. [487] Every version she'd ever known, superimposed into a shimmering possibility. [497]

"You're not him," she whispered. [502]

The shape tilted its head in a gesture so familiar her chest ached. [515] "I'm what remains when someone isn't gone and isn't here," it said with a voice like wind through the orchard branches. [536] "I'm the space between your equations." [542]

Mira understood then. [545] She had been trying to solve for Theo when she should have been solving for herself. [560] The mathematics of emotion wasn't about locating the lost. [570] It was about mapping the shape loss carved in the one who stayed. [583]

She picked up the glass eyes, warm now with residual magic. [594] The apparition faded, but the orchard seemed brighter somehow, the fruit more vivid. [608]

She would return tomorrow night, and the night after. [618] Not to find Theo—she accepted now that some equations had no solutions—but to continue her gently inventive work. [636] To dovetail loss and love into something she could carry. [646]

Above her, through the cavern's ceiling, moonlight shifted. [654] Somewhere, water dripped its patient rhythm onto ancient stone. [663] Somewhere, an orchard grew in darkness, fed by what fell from above. [676]

Mira climbed toward the surface, the glass eyes safe in her pocket, their mismatched gazes finally at peace. [693] She had not found her brother. [699] But she had found the formula for surviving his absence, and buried within that discovery was something unexpected: the first green shoot of optimism she had felt in seven years. [729]

The mountain kept its secrets. [734] So did she. [737] But now they were secrets she chose, not secrets that chose her. [750]
