The catacomb orchard had no sky, only the vaulted stone ceiling where phosphorescent moss painted everything in perpetual twilight. [24] Mira descended the worn steps, her lantern unnecessary within the glow of half-lit corridors that stretched between the ancient trees. [43] Their roots snaked through femurs and ribcages, drinking deep from the calcified remains of ten thousand forgotten dead. [59] Apples grew here nonetheless, pale as moonstone, fed by the mineral memory of lives long ended. [75]

She was a reckless idealist, everyone said so. [83] Her mother had called her foolish for believing the old stories. [94] Her teachers had dismissed her theories about the soul traders who once walked these passages. [109] But Mira had spent seventeen years with a hole in her chest that no prayer, no medicine, no love could fill. [131] She had come to patch holes in the soul, and the catacomb orchard was the only place where such mending remained possible. [153]

The burned tarot card in her pocket still smelled of smoke and sacrifice. [166] The Tower, half-consumed by flame, its image forever caught between destruction and possibility. [179] She had pulled it from her grandmother's dying fingers three weeks ago, along with the whispered confession: "I traded your fate for mine, child. [201] Find the Gardener. [204] Make him give it back." [209]

Bartered destinies were the currency of this place. [217] Mira understood that now, inlaying meaning everywhere she looked as she walked deeper into the orchard. [232] The skulls arranged in geometric patterns along the walls were not random decoration but a ledger of transactions. [249] The way certain roots avoided certain bones while embracing others told stories of choices made in desperation. [266] Every detail mattered here, every symbol carried weight. [274]

She found the Gardener beneath the oldest tree, its trunk so thick three people could not have encircled it. [292] He was pruning dead branches with movements that seemed almost tender, despite his skeletal frame and the darkness pooling in his eye sockets. [314] Yet when he turned to face her, his voice was fiercely gentle, soft as moss, warm as decay. [332]

"Another seeker," he said, not a question. [339] "Another hole that needs filling." [344]

"My grandmother made a trade." [349] Mira's voice did not waver. [354] "She gave you my destiny to extend her own life. [364] I want it back." [368]

The Gardener laughed, a sound like wind through bone. [377] "And what will you offer in exchange? [384] Destinies are not refunded. [388] They must be bartered anew." [393]

Mira pulled out the burned tarot card. [400] "This was hers. [403] The fate she purchased with mine. [409] I'm returning it." [412]

"That is not how the exchange works, child." [420] He stepped closer, and she saw that his hands, though skeletal, moved with impossible gentleness among the pale fruit. [439] "To trammel a destiny, to bind it back to its original owner, requires sacrifice. [453] Not payment. [455] Sacrifice." [456]

"Then tell me what." [460]

He studied her with those dark hollows. [467] "Your grandmother bought forty years of life. [474] Forty years you would have lived with purpose, with fire, with a fate that mattered. [489] To reclaim it, you must give up forty years of certainty. [501] You will live, but never knowing if any choice is truly yours. [513] Never trusting that your path is your own. [521] Is uncertainty not its own kind of hole?" [529]

Mira thought of the emptiness she had carried since birth. [539] The sense that she was living someone else's shadow. [548] At least uncertainty was hers to bear. [555]

"I accept." [557]

The Gardener reached toward her chest, his touch fiercely gentle, and she felt something shift in the darkness behind her ribs. [577] The burned card in her hand crumbled to ash, and somewhere above, in the world of sun and sky, her grandmother's borrowed time ended. [601]

Mira climbed back through the half-lit corridors, past the snaking roots and sleeping bones, carrying her reclaimed destiny like a wounded bird. [622] It was damaged, uncertain, frayed at the edges. [630] But it was hers. [634]

The catacomb orchard kept her secret, as it kept all secrets, in the patient embrace of root and stone and the quiet resolve of those who chose to make themselves whole again, whatever the cost. [668] Above her, the phosphorescent moss dimmed as she ascended, as if the ancient place itself was closing its eyes. [687] She emerged into true darkness for the first time in her life, and smiled. [701]

Even the night felt like possibility now. [708]
