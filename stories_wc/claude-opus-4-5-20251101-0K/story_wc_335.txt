Mira walked backwards through the forgotten library, her heels clicking an anxious retreat against marble floors that hadn't felt a mop in decades. [27] She always moved this way when the weight of decisions pressed against her chest, a habit formed in childhood that she'd never outgrown. [50] The shard-mirror archivists had found it endearing at first, then simply accepted it as part of who she was, this woman who catalogued fragments of broken reflections. [75]

Today, however, she had reason beyond mere nervousness. [83] Today she would decide whether to annotate the final page of Kael's exile record, the boy who had shattered the Sacred Looking Glass three winters ago. [106]

She paused at her desk, where afternoon light slanted through the grimy window and caught in a glass paperweight, trapping a shadow like amber preserves a wasp. [133] The afternoon shadow caught in glass seemed to pulse with judgment. [144] Mira touched it gently, remembering how Kael had touched the Sacred Looking Glass the same way—curious, reverent, destructive. [162]

"You're thinking about him again." [167]

Mira didn't turn. [170] Old Thessaly emerged from between towering shelves, carrying a chipped teacup. [181] The elder archivist had been her mentor once, before reversing her own exile and returning to these dust-clogged halls. [199]

"The council wants my recommendation," Mira said, finally rotating to face her. [211] "Reversible exile was designed for those who could prove transformation. [220] How do I know if he's transformed?" [227]

Thessaly set the teacup on Mira's desk with deliberate care. [237] "You analyze. [239] That's what you do." [243]

Mira stared at the tea leaves settling in murky patterns at the cup's bottom. [257] By analyzing the geometry of tea leaves, the old texts claimed, one could read intention in its purest form. [276] She'd dismissed it as superstition until Thessaly had shown her otherwise—not fortune-telling, but pattern recognition, the same skill that made her invaluable as a shard-mirror archivist. [304]

"Triangles mean conflict unresolved," Mira murmured, tracing the shapes with her gaze. [316] "But look—they point inward, not outward. [323] His war is with himself now." [329]

"And?" [330]

"And circles. [332] So many circles, nested like years." [338] Mira felt her throat tighten. [343] "He's been walking in circles, waiting." [350]

She thought of the timeframe of his exile—measured not in days but in silences, in moments like the hush as an empty playground swing drifts in the breeze. [378] Kael had been eleven when they cast him out, old enough to understand consequence, young enough to be crushed by it. [400] Now he was fourteen, and Mira had watched his file grow thick with reports of a boy who rebuilt what others discarded, who taught younger exiles to mend rather than break. [432]

"You want to mentor him," Thessaly said. [440] It wasn't a question. [444]

"I want to mentor resilience quietly," Mira corrected, her voice sharpening despite herself. [456] "Not parade him as reformed. [461] Not make him a symbol. [466] Just give him the tools to survive what he remembers." [476]

"That sounds like tenderness." [480]

"It sounds like combat." [484] Mira grabbed her annotation quill. [489] "Every day he'll fight the memory of what he destroyed. [499] Every day he'll face archivists who remember his hands covered in mirror-dust. [511] I'm not offering him comfort. [516] I'm offering him armor." [520]

She began to annotate his record, her script precise and unforgiving. [531] Recommendation for exile reversal. [535] Conditional mentorship under Archivist Mira Voss. [541] Restricted access to reflection chambers for minimum two years. [550]

The words felt inadequate, but words always did. [558] The real work would happen in the silences between lessons, in the moments when Kael walked backwards through his own anxiety and Mira pretended not to notice. [585]

Thessaly watched her finish, then collected the teacup with its prophetic dregs. [597] "You reversed your own exile once," the old woman said quietly. [608] "Shattered something precious. [611] Someone gave you the same chance." [617]

Mira set down her quill. [622] The afternoon shadow in the glass had shifted, stretching toward evening, toward change. [635] "I know," she said. [639] "That's why I have to do this right. [648] Combative tenderness, you called it once. [655] Love that demands growth rather than permits stagnation." [663]

She sealed the annotation with red wax, pressing her shard-mirror sigil into its surface. [677] Tomorrow, Kael would return to the forgotten library, walking whatever direction his nerves demanded. [691] And Mira would be here, ready to teach him that broken things could still reflect light—differently, imperfectly, but reflecting nonetheless. [711]

Outside, somewhere beyond these walls, a swing drifted in evening silence, waiting for a child to return. [729]
