Mira had not expected to find an orchard underground. [10]

She descended the worn stone steps with her lantern held low, following the map her grandmother had pressed into her hands before the old woman's final breath. [37] Twenty years in distant cities had taught Mira to trust nothing without evidence, yet here she was, a diaspora returnee chasing faith down into the earth of her ancestors. [63]

The catacombs opened into a vast chamber where apple trees grew in impossible rows, their roots threading through skulls and ribcages like patient fingers. [86] Pale fruit hung from branches that had never known sunlight, and the air tasted of soil and sweetness and something older than memory. [108] Mira's breath caught in her throat, not from fear, but from a warmly curious wonder she had thought lost to childhood. [130]

She had come to excavate a tomb, to find proof that the old stories were lies, that her family's devotion had been wasted on empty tradition. [157] Instead, she found herself wandering purposefully between the bone-laced trees, drawn deeper by something she could not name. [174]

The map indicated a central chamber, but Mira let her feet choose the path. [188] Each tree she passed bore small tokens tied to its branches—faded ribbons, carved beads, paper prayers curled with age. [206] These were offerings from generations of her people, pilgrims who had made this journey before the wars scattered them across the world. [227]

On the third day of excavation, she discovered the sundial base. [238]

It sat in a clearing where four trees had grown together, their roots forming a natural altar around a carved stone pedestal. [260] The gnomon was missing, broken off at some point in the centuries since someone had placed this impossible timekeeper in a place without sun. [284] Mira knelt before it, tracing the hour lines with her fingers, and understood. [297]

This was never meant to measure daylight. [304] The sundial had tracked something else entirely—the slow passage of faith through darkness, the hours spent in devotion when no light remained to guide the way. [330]

Her grandmother had spoken of interrupted journeys, of pilgrims who began the descent but turned back when their courage faltered. [350] The tokens on the trees marked how far each one had come before retreating. [365] Mira's own mother had made it to the second chamber before fleeing, pregnant and alone, to build a new life in a country that did not remember these roots. [395]

Now Mira understood her motivation with sudden clarity: she had not come to disprove the faith but to restore it, to complete the journey her family had abandoned. [424]

She began to rebuild. [428]

Through purposeful wandering, she gathered materials—a straight branch from the oldest tree, stripped and shaped with her excavation tools. [447] She found copper wire among the offerings and bound it tight. [458] When she placed the makeshift gnomon into the sundial base, something shifted in the catacomb's still air. [474]

The pale apples began to glow. [480]

Soft light spread through the orchard, casting shadows that moved like hour hands across the walls of bone. [497] Mira watched with cautious enchantment as the sundial performed its ancient function, not measuring time but generating it—making time where none existed, creating moments of grace in the perpetual dark. [528]

She spent another week completing the excavation, not of artifacts but of understanding. [542] Each day she wandered new paths between the trees, discovering chambers her grandmother's map had not shown. [559] She found the names of her ancestors carved into roots, found the place where her great-great-grandmother had planted the first seed with hands still dirty from burying her husband. [588]

The tomb she had come to excavate was not a place of death but of continuation. [604] Her people had built this orchard to prove that life persists, that roots can grow through bones and transform ending into beginning. [624]

When Mira finally climbed back into the sunlight, she carried seeds in her pocket and the sundial base strapped to her pack. [647] She would plant new trees in the courtyard of her grandmother's empty house. [662] She would teach her own children to make the pilgrimage. [673]

The interrupted journey of her family had found its completion, and her lost faith had returned not as certainty but as something better—as wonder, as warmly curious devotion to mysteries that did not demand answers. [710]

Behind her, in the darkness below, the orchard continued its patient work of growing light from bone. [728]
