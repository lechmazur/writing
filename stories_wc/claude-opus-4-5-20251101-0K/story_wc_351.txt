The canyon walls spiraled upward like frozen helixes, their striations catching moonlight in patterns that only Vera could read. [21] She had always thought this way—in spirals, in coils, in the endless turning of DNA strands and drilling mechanisms and the recursive loops of memory itself. [45] Tonight, the transformation she had been engineering for three years would finally complete itself, or it would unravel her entirely. [63]

In her trembling hands, she held the broken periscope mirror, its surface cracked into seven precise fragments that still somehow held together. [82] She had salvaged it from the submarine her grandmother had died in, that vessel of abandoned dreams rotting at the bottom of a reservoir no one remembered. [106] The mirror had once helped navigate darkness through reflection, and now Vera would modify it for a different kind of navigation entirely. [127]

Her workshop—a converted mining station carved into the canyon wall—hummed with equipment that seemed to contradict itself at every turn. [147] Chaotically precise, her colleagues had called her methods, before they stopped being colleagues and became merely people who once knew her. [167] Every wire crossed at impossible angles yet carried current perfectly. [177] Every calculation sprawled across her walls in what looked like madness but predicted outcomes to the seventh decimal. [193]

The procedure she had designed worked through synaptic plasticity, rewiring the brain's architecture to access memories that weren't strictly one's own. [213] Entangled memories, she called them—the psychic residue left behind when someone abandoned a dream so violently that it scarred the fabric of consciousness itself. [235] Her grandmother had dreamed of exploring trenches no human had seen. [246] Her father had dreamed of composing symphonies for instruments not yet invented. [257] Her mother had dreamed of growing gardens on Mars. [266]

All of them had abandoned these dreams, and the abandonment had killed something in them long before their bodies followed. [285] Vera had watched each of them hollow out, and she had sworn to become something new—an archaeologist of these forsaken visions, someone who could excavate what others had buried and give it form again. [319]

The moonlight shifted, and the canyon sang with wind that seemed to carry voices. [333] Vera positioned the broken mirror at the precise angle her calculations demanded, letting its fractured surface catch the light and split it into seven distinct beams. [358] Each beam illuminated a different neural interface she had embedded in her own skull over months of agonizing self-surgery. [376]

She initiated the sequence. [380]

The first memory hit her like drowning—her grandmother's hands on submarine controls, the pressure of depth crushing hope into something dense and brilliant. [400] Then her father's, fingers aching for piano keys that could play colors instead of notes. [415] Then her mother's, soil samples from a world forty million miles away crumbling between imaginary fingers. [430]

The dreams cascaded through her modified neurons, finding purchase in tissue she had prepared for exactly this colonization. [447] Her brain burned and rebuilt itself, synapses firing and dying and reforming in configurations that human evolution had never intended. [467] She screamed, and the canyon echoed her transformation back at her in harmonics that sounded almost like approval. [484]

When it ended, Vera lay on the cold stone floor, the broken mirror still clutched against her chest. [501] She could feel them now—not just her family's abandoned dreams but others, thousands of others, pressing against the edges of her consciousness like archaeological sites waiting for excavation. [528] A Victorian engineer who had envisioned wireless electricity. [536] A medieval nun who had theorized flight. [542] A child in ancient Mesopotamia who had dreamed of capturing starlight in jars. [554]

The canyon walls still spiraled upward, but now Vera could see them differently. [566] Each striation was a layer of abandoned time, each shadow a dream that someone had once held precious before letting it fall. [586] She stood on unsteady legs, her helix-minded perception now expanded into dimensions she had only theorized. [602]

The broken mirror caught moonlight one final time, and in its fragmented reflection, Vera saw not herself but all the dreamers whose visions she would now carry forward. [629] She had become their archaeologist, their resurrectionist, their living monument to everything that had been surrendered too soon. [647]

Tomorrow she would begin the excavations in earnest. [655] Tonight, she simply stood in the quaking reverie of what she had become, listening to the canyon whisper secrets in the voices of the forgotten. [678] The transformation was complete. [682] The work—the true work—was only beginning, and it would take the rest of her spiral-shaped life to complete. [701]

She climbed toward the canyon rim as dawn began to threaten the darkness, carrying within her the weight of a thousand unlived futures finally ready to be born. [730]
