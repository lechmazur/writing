In the mirror world, where light had become legend, Elara tended the alchemical orchard greenhouse with trembling hands. [20] Her memories scattered like seeds in wind, fragments of faces and names drifting beyond her grasp, yet she remembered the songs. [39] Always the songs. [42]

The greenhouse stretched in crystalline silence beneath endless night, its mica windows catching no sunlight because there was none left to catch. [61] Once, these translucent panes had filtered golden warmth into prismatic rainbows that nourished the luminous trees. [76] Now they stood as monuments to absence, their thin mineral sheets reflecting only Elara's gaunt face and the phosphorescent glow of dying silver apples. [97]

She was the memory keeper, though she kept them poorly. [107] Names slipped through her consciousness like water through cupped fingers. [117] She had forgotten her mother's voice, her village's location, the reason she had first come to this place. [134] But the songs remained embedded in her throat like seeds waiting to sprout. [147]

The realm was dying. [151] Without woven dawns—the intricate tapestries of light that once spread across the mirror world's sky each morning—the land had withered into shadow. [172] The alchemical trees, whose fruit once sustained entire communities, produced only bitter dust. [185] Elara could feel the wrongness in her bones, the way darkness pressed against the mica windows with hungry patience. [202]

She began to sing. [206]

The melody emerged rusty and uncertain, a lullaby she could not remember learning. [219] It spoke of gathering threads of starlight, of fingers weaving luminescence into fabric, of communities standing together at the horizon's edge to catch the first golden strands. [244] A forgotten song, abandoned when people stopped believing dawn would ever return. [256]

The nearest mica window trembled. [261]

Elara pressed her palm against its cool surface, feeling vibrations answer her voice. [274] Through the translucent sheet, she glimpsed movement—not outside, but within the mineral itself. [287] Memories stirred there, trapped like insects in amber. [295] She saw figures gathered around looms of light, their hands passing radiant threads back and forth, their voices raised in this same ancient song. [316]

The mica had remembered what she could not. [324]

She sang louder, and the windows throughout the greenhouse began resonating in harmony. [337] Each pane held different memories: here, a woman teaching her daughter to weave; there, a council of elders blending their voices to strengthen the dawn's fabric. [360] The songs had never truly been forgotten—they had been preserved in the very bones of this place, waiting. [377]

Elara moved between the dying trees, gathering fallen petals that still held traces of silver light. [392] She began to swaddle each mica window with these petals, wrapping them like precious infants, singing all the while. [410] The gesture was instinctive, rising from depths of memory she could not consciously access. [423] This was how the weavers had prepared their looms—by cradling the frames in organic matter, creating vessels where light could take root. [443]

The darkness outside pressed harder against the glass, sensing threat. [453]

But within the swaddled windows, something kindled. [460] Pale threads began spiraling outward from each petal-wrapped pane, seeking connections. [471] They found each other across the greenhouse's expanse, linking window to window in an expanding web. [485] The alchemical trees stirred, their branches reaching toward the nascent light. [496]

Elara's scattered memories began returning—not as possessions but as shared gifts. [507] She saw that she was not one memory keeper but many, her consciousness distributed across every person who had ever sung these songs. [528] The community she had thought lost lived within her voice, within every mica window that had witnessed their gatherings. [546]

The web of light grew dense enough to illuminate the entire greenhouse. [558] Then it pushed outward, through the windows, into the endless night. [569] The mica panes no longer merely reflected—they transmitted, becoming thresholds through which accumulated memory flowed into the starving world. [586]

Dawn would not return all at once. [593] It would be woven slowly, thread by thread, voice by voice, as people throughout the mirror world remembered the old songs and added their strands to the growing fabric. [620] Elara understood now that rekindling a dying realm required not a single brilliant flame but countless small lights choosing to burn together. [642]

She pressed her forehead against the nearest window, watching the first pale threads stretch toward the horizon. [658] The mica felt warm now, alive with purpose. [666] Somewhere beyond the greenhouse, she heard another voice take up the melody—thin and uncertain, but present. [682]

Then another. [684]

The bound darkness was releasing its grip, one forgotten song at a time. [696] Elara kept singing, her scattered memories finally finding their home in the shared tapestry of light. [712] By the time true dawn broke, she would remember nothing of herself and everything of her people. [729]

This was the price. [733]

This was the gift. [737]

The woven dawns spread onward, knitting communities together across the mirror world's wounded sky. [751]
