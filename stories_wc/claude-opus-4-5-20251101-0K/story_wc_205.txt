The baroque asteroid Verantis-7 drifted through space like a forgotten jewel, its surface carved into impossible spirals and gilded arches by the civilization that once breathed here. [31] Maren stood at the observatory's edge, watching time flow past the crystalline dome in ribbons of amber and violet—visible now, ever since the Fracture had peeled back reality's skin. [59]

She had been a revolutionary once, before the cause died and took her purpose with it. [73] Now she was merely a woman with ink-stained fingers and a heart that spoke in verse, cataloging the bones of a dead world while the academic council debated ownership of its ghosts. [105]

The archaeological dispute had raged for three standard years. [114] The Consortium claimed Verantis-7 belonged to them by right of discovery; the Remnant Collective argued that the asteroid's people were their ancestors, scattered across the galaxy before memory became reliable. [142] Maren cared nothing for their territorial squabbles. [150] She wanted only to understand—to reimagine an entire civilization from the fragments they'd left behind. [165]

In her quarters, she kept a crystal vase shard wrapped in synthetic silk. [178] It had been the first artifact she'd uncovered, three years ago, when her hands still trembled with the ghost of revolution. [197] The shard caught light like captured lightning, and sometimes, when the temporal storms rolled across the asteroid's surface, she thought she could see faces moving within it. [225]

The storms came often now, great waves of visible time crashing against the baroque spires. [240] Maren had developed her own ritual for surviving them: covering mirrors during storms, draping them with dark cloth so the reflections wouldn't show what had been or what might be. [268] The other archaeologists thought her superstitious, but they hadn't seen what she'd seen—hadn't watched their own past selves reaching through the glass, mouths open in warnings that never arrived in time. [300]

Tonight, the temporal currents ran thick and golden outside her window. [312] She turned the crystal shard in her fingers and began to devise a new theory, one that would reshape everything they thought they knew about Verantis-7. [336]

The civilization hadn't died. [340] They had seen time coming—visible, inevitable, beautiful—and they had chosen to step sideways into it. [355] The baroque architecture wasn't decorative excess; it was calculation, each spiral designed to catch temporal flow like a sail catches wind. [374] They had sailed away on the river of their own history. [386]

Maren wrote her hypothesis in verse, because that was how truth moved through her. [400] "They carved their goodbye in stone and gold / and left us here to count the cold / spaces between what was and is / while they dance in temporal bliss." [430]

The words felt hollow, burnished with a sorrow she couldn't shake. [442] Her revolutionary days had taught her that grand theories meant nothing without proof, and proof required sacrifice. [458]

She looked at the mirrors she'd covered, then at the storm raging outside. [472] The crystal shard pulsed in her palm like a heartbeat remembering itself. [485]

Maren uncovered the largest mirror. [490]

The reflection showed her younger self, fierce-eyed and certain, standing at the barricades of a revolution that would fail. [507] But behind that image, deeper in the glass, she saw them—the people of Verantis-7, frozen mid-step in their eternal departure. [528] They turned to look at her with eyes like polished amber. [540]

She understood now. [543] The vase shard wasn't a fragment of something broken; it was a key left behind for whoever loved their world enough to follow. [566] To reimagine their civilization meant to join it, to step through the storm-touched mirror and become part of the verse they'd written across reality. [592]

Maren pressed the crystal to the glass. [599] The mirror rippled like water. [604] Behind her, her research notes fluttered in a sudden wind, carrying her theories out into the baroque corridors where the academic council would find them and argue for another three years about what they meant. [639]

She smiled, feeling the old revolutionary fire kindle in her chest. [651] Perhaps this was what she'd always been meant to overthrow—not governments or systems, but the boundary between what was lost and what could be remembered. [676]

The temporal storm sang against the spires of Verantis-7 as Maren stepped through the mirror, the crystal shard dissolving into light against her heart. [700] The baroque asteroid continued its slow drift through space, but it was no longer a tomb. [717] It was a doorway, and she had finally found the courage to walk through. [732]

In the silence she left behind, her final poem waited on the desk: "All civilizations end in leaving / All departures start with believing / That somewhere beyond the visible hours / We too might become something ours." [768]

The mirrors stood uncovered now, reflecting only the storm. [778]
