The diminutive titan stood no taller than a child, yet her shadow stretched across the ancient temple library like a mourning veil draped over forgotten centuries. [28]

Mira had been guardian here since before the stars learned their current positions, watching constellations shift and pause in their eternal dance while dust settled on scrolls that held the world's oldest truths. [56] Her stature contradicted her nature—titans were meant to shoulder mountains, not cradle delicate manuscripts—but she moved through the towering shelves with a grace that made the air itself seem clumsy. [83]

The library existed outside proper time, suspended in the breath between one celestial arrangement and the next. [97] When the stars paused their slow rotation, Mira worked. [106] When they moved again, she waited. [112] This had been her rhythm for eons, regally unpretentious in her vigil, wearing no crown though she could have claimed one, demanding no worship though prayers still echoed in the marble columns. [141]

But now someone had disturbed the silence. [148]

She traced her finger along a message scrawled in the margin of a crumbling bestiary: "The crowned one wears borrowed light." [168] The ink was iron gall, the same ancient formula the temple scribes had used millennia ago, yet this message was fresh—the acid still eating into the vellum. [195] Mira had found seven such messages across the past three pauses, each cryptic warning left in a different text, each pointing toward the same terrible truth. [220]

Someone in the mortal realm was about to crown a pretender to the throne of the Eastern Sovereignty. [238]

The library remembered everything, including the bloodlines of every dynasty that had ever sought its wisdom. [254] Mira pulled an iron gall ink pellet from her robe—the last of the original temple supply, compressed to the size of a river stone and hard as obsidian. [281] She wet it with water from the eternal spring that fed the library's gardens, and the black liquid bloomed like smoke in clear water. [306]

The rune of drift materialized beneath her brush: a symbol that meant dissolution, passage, the graceful collapse of one thing into another. [327] It was the mark of transitions, of kingdoms ending not in fire but in the gentle erosion of legitimacy. [345] She painted it onto a blank page, then watched it sink through the parchment, through the shelf, through the stone floor itself—drifting down into the mortal world below. [373]

Whoever had left those cryptic warnings would recognize it. [382] They would know help was coming. [388]

Mira descended through levels of the library she had not visited in centuries, passing chambers where scrolls had turned to powder and chambers where they remained pristine as the day they were written. [417] The architecture folded around her, corridors that existed in multiple times simultaneously, and she walked them all. [435]

At the library's lowest level, she found what the messages had prepared her to find: a genealogical record, deliberately misfiled, showing that Prince Aldric of the Eastern Sovereignty was not the late king's son at all. [469] He was a changeling, a usurper's tool, planted in the royal nursery thirty-two years ago by a sorcerer who had since died with the secret. [497]

But someone else had discovered it. [503] Someone who could not speak openly, who could only hide truth in the margins of borrowed books, hoping the library's guardian would piece together what they dared not say aloud. [531]

Mira understood now. [534] She would have to sunder the pretender's claim, not with violence—titans had learned long ago that breaking things solved nothing—but with truth. [555] She gathered the evidence: birth records, astrological charts, the sorcerer's own journal buried in the restricted stacks. [571]

The constellations were beginning to shift again. [578] Time was resuming its flow. [582]

She climbed back to the main hall, where the great windows showed stars sliding into new positions, marking the end of an age. [602] With careful hands, she placed the compiled evidence into a reading alcove where visiting scholars might find it—where the right scholar, the desperate one who had been leaving messages, would certainly find it. [635]

The graceful collapse of a false dynasty would begin with paperwork, as all the best collapses did. [652]

Mira returned to her post among the highest shelves, diminutive and patient, watching the stars settle into their new arrangement. [671] The throne would find its rightful heir. [678] The pretender would fall not to armies but to ink and vellum, to the quiet power of records kept too well. [699]

She was a titan, after all. [705] She did not need to be large to hold up the weight of truth. [719]
