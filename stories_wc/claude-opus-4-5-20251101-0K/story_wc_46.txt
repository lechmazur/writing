The serpentine grotto breathed mist like a sleeping dragon, its curved walls glistening with mineral deposits that caught what little light filtered through the entrance. [28] Maren had discovered this place forty years ago, when her legs could still carry her up the coastal cliffs without protest. [47] Now she came less frequently, but always when the memories grew too heavy to carry alone. [62]

She settled onto the smooth stone ledge where she had once sat with her daughter, setting down her worn leather satchel. [81] The grotto's natural acoustics amplified even her gentle movements, creating whispers that seemed to answer her presence. [96] From the satchel, she withdrew a collection of sea glass gathered over decades, each piece holding a moment she refused to release. [117]

The emerald fragment had been Lila's favorite. [124] Her daughter would hold it up to the sun and laugh at how it painted green shadows across her face. [142] That was before the fever took her, before Maren learned that some lights extinguish without warning. [157]

She arranged the pieces on the ledge, their frosted surfaces reflectively vibrant even in the grotto's dim atmosphere. [173] The mist caught what luminescence existed and multiplied it, creating an ethereal glow that seemed to emanate from the glass itself. [193] This was why she came here to work. [201]

From her satchel, Maren retrieved her polishing tools, the same kit she had used for thirty years as a gem polisher at the harbor jeweler's shop. [225] The craft had taught her patience, the art of revealing beauty hidden beneath rough surfaces. [240] Now retired, she applied those skills to humbler materials, transforming beach-worn glass into something precious. [254]

She selected a piece of blue glass, its edges still sharp in places, and began to work. [271] The familiar motion calmed her as memories resurfaced, playing across her mind like light through water. [287] Lila at seven, collecting shells. [292] Lila at twelve, asking why stars fell. [299] Lila at sixteen, gone. [303]

Maren had spent years as an earthbound star watcher after that, climbing to high places each night to map the heavens her daughter had loved. [326] She learned the constellations, tracked the wandering planets, witnessed meteor showers that felt like messages. [341] But she could never share what she saw. [349] Fire was the traditional beacon, the ancient way of signaling from hilltops, but fire reminded her too much of fever's heat. [369]

The sea glass caught the ambient glow as she polished, and suddenly Maren understood what she had been working toward all these years. [391] She lifted the blue piece, now smooth as water, and watched it gather the grotto's diffuse light and hold it. [411] A pearl of stillness formed in her chest, that rare moment when grief and gratitude balanced perfectly. [428]

She could weigh this feeling, she realized, the same way she had once weighed gemstones on her precision scale. [446] Sorrow measured against love, loss against legacy. [453] The calculation never quite balanced, but perhaps that was the point. [464]

Working steadily, Maren polished each piece of glass, then began arranging them in a spiral pattern on the ledge. [482] The mist swirled around her creation, and the glass began to glow with borrowed light, passing illumination from piece to piece. [502] No flame, no heat. [506] Just cold light, gentle as a zephyr bloom, those first spring flowers that opened to wind rather than sun. [524]

She imagined other grieving souls finding this grotto, following the trail of sea glass she would leave along the path. [543] They would enter the mist and find this spiral of light, this message that said: I too have lost. [562] I too still search the sky. [568] We need not burn to shine. [574]

The polishing complete, Maren placed the final piece, the emerald glass, at the spiral's heart. [589] Lila's fragment, now smooth as forgiveness, anchored the entire arrangement. [599]

She sat in the serpentine curves of the grotto as the mist thickened toward evening, watching her creation pulse with soft radiance. [620] Tomorrow, others might come. [624] They might add their own pieces, their own polished griefs, and the spiral would grow. [639] A community of light-sharers, learning what Maren had finally understood. [649]

Fire devours. [651] But this, this patient glow, sustained itself on nothing but presence. [662]

Maren gathered her tools and stood slowly, her joints protesting the damp. [674] She looked back once at the glowing spiral, then made her way toward the entrance where the first stars were emerging. [694] Tonight she would watch them again, but this time she would not feel so alone. [710]

She had finally found a way to share what she saw. [721]

The mist followed her out like a blessing, carrying fragments of light into the darkening world. [737]
