The whale had been dead three days when Mira finally understood what the coffee grounds were telling her. [18]

She had worked as the dock-side lantern lighter for eleven years, her hands calloused from striking flint against steel each dusk, her lungs accustomed to the brine-thick air. [43] But the beaching changed everything. [48] The massive creature had washed ashore carrying something in its belly that the tide master's men extracted before dawn—a sphere of compressed light that fluctuated mysteriously, pulsing between impossible brightness and absolute darkness. [77]

They'd taken it to the salt crystal growing chamber beneath the old lighthouse, where the walls glittered white and silence gleamed like polished glass. [100] Mira had followed, drawn by something she couldn't name, a hollow ache where memories should have been. [117]

Her mother had disappeared when Mira was seven. [125] Not died—disappeared, as if erased from the world's ledger. [135] Mira remembered fragments: the smell of crushed lavender, a voice humming, hands pressing wildflowers between pages of a heavy book. [153] But the center of these memories was gone, excavated clean, leaving only the edges. [168]

In the salt chamber, she learned the sphere created pockets of gravity that behaved unlike anything natural. [184] Objects drifted toward it, then repelled violently. [191] Time moved strangely in its presence. [197] The tide master declared it dangerous, sealed the chamber, and forbade entry. [209]

Mira obeyed for two days. [214]

On the third morning, she sat in her cramped quarters above the dock keeper's office, staring into her coffee cup. [231] The grounds had settled into a pattern she recognized from her mother's old divination books—the ones Mira had hidden beneath her floorboards after the disappearance, the ones she'd taught herself to read in secret. [263] The pattern showed a spiral descending into a closed eye. [274]

It meant exhumation. [277] It meant bringing buried things to light. [284]

That night, instead of lighting the harbor lanterns, Mira descended to the salt chamber with her mother's book of pressed wildflowers tucked against her chest. [309] The book was the only proof her mother had existed at all; townspeople claimed not to remember her, records showed no marriage to Mira's father, no birth certificate for a daughter named Mira Voss. [344]

The sphere hung suspended in the chamber's center, its luminescence casting the salt crystals in silver fire. [361] The gravity fluctuated mysteriously around her—one moment her hair lifted toward the ceiling, the next her knees buckled under invisible weight. [382] The silence gleamed, thick and crystalline, pressing against her eardrums. [393]

Mira opened the book. [397]

Pressed between the pages were forget-me-nots, sea lavender, yarrow blooms flattened into paper-thin ghosts of themselves. [413] She held them toward the sphere, and the gravity seized them, drawing them into the light. [430]

The sphere cracked open. [434]

Inside was not emptiness but density—compressed moments, stolen memories, deleted lives swirling in a vortex of captured time. [451] Mira saw her mother's face clearly for the first time in eighteen years: dark eyes, weathered skin, a smile that curved like the moon's edge. [477] She saw her mother standing before another sphere, making a bargain, trading herself to seal something monstrous away. [494]

The memories poured back like water through a broken dam. [504] Her mother had been a keeper of boundaries, a lighter of different lanterns—ones that burned between worlds. [521] The whale had swallowed the prison sphere when her mother's seal finally failed, carrying it across oceans until death beached it on this shore. [546]

Mira understood now. [549] The pockets of gravity were tears in reality, places where deleted things accumulated like sediment. [564] Her mother had known that erasure was never permanent, only displaced. [575]

She pressed her palm against the sphere's surface. [583] The fluctuation steadied, recognizing the bloodline of its jailer. [592] Her mother's voice rose from the depths, faint but clear: "Light the lantern, Mira. [606] Not the ones on the dock. [612] The one I left you." [617]

In the book's back cover, pressed flat as any flower, was a key made of crystallized salt. [635] Mira had looked at it a thousand times, never seeing it for what it was. [651]

She climbed from the chamber as dawn broke over the harbor. [662] The whale's carcass still lay on the beach, being slowly claimed by gulls and tide. [678] In the lighthouse's highest room, behind a panel she'd never thought to open, waited a lantern of black iron and blue glass. [700]

Mira struck her flint. [704]

The flame caught, burning with colors that had no names, illuminating a door that had always been there, hidden in the gleaming silence between moments. [728]

Her mother stood on the other side, older, transparent as sea glass, but smiling. [743]

"You found where deleted memories go," her mother whispered. [752]

"I did," Mira said. [756] "Now I'm going to bring them home." [763]

She stepped through the door, lantern raised, leaving the salt chamber's silence gleaming behind her. [778]
