The elevator groaned upward through the icebound spire, its brass gears clicking against the frozen walls as Mira clutched the leather case to her chest. [28] She had been a servant in the Cloudspire household for seven years, but today marked her final ascent through the ten floors that separated the kitchens from Lady Vesper's abandoned observatory. [58]

Through the elevator's frosted window, she watched the clouds thin into wisps, revealing the pale blue nothing that existed above the world. [79] The airship captain's goggles hung around her neck, their amber lenses catching the strange light that filtered through ice crystals embedded in the walls. [101] They had belonged to her mother, who had piloted supply vessels between the spires before the Great Freeze claimed her ship and scattered her belongings across the household's charity boxes. [131]

Mira had found her mother's encrypted diary three days ago, tucked behind a false panel in the servants' quarters. [150] The leather was cracked, the pages filled with symbols that made no sense until she discovered the goggles' secret purpose. [170] When she held the amber lenses over the pages, the scattered light transformed the cryptic markings into words, sentences, confessions. [189]

The elevator passed the fourth floor, and Mira allowed herself to unfold the first page she had decoded. [207] Her mother's handwriting filled the margins around the decrypted text, small notes that spoke of joy found in unexpected places. [226] "I have learned," the entry read, "that grief is merely joy wearing a heavier coat. [241] Beneath every anguish, there waits something precious that the sorrow was trying to protect." [255]

Mira understood now why she had spent seven years climbing these floors, carrying trays and folding linens and listening to the household's whispered sorrows. [278] She was warmly inquisitive by nature, always asking the cook about her late husband's favorite meals, always wondering what made the groundskeeper tend the frozen gardens with such devotion. [307] She had thought herself merely curious, but her mother's diary revealed a different truth. [322]

The sixth floor passed in silence. [328] Through the goggles' lenses, the ice walls became prisms, casting rainbows across Mira's hands as she read another entry. [348] Her mother had written about the Cloudspire's highest room, about Lady Vesper's grief for a daughter lost to the winds, about a secret that waited in the observatory above the clouds. [379]

"The lady keeps her joy locked in amber glass," the diary explained. [391] "She thinks preserving it will protect her from losing anything else. [402] But joy is not meant for preservation. [409] It must be released, must touch the light, must scatter and reform in new patterns." [425]

The eighth floor. [428] Mira's heart beat steadily despite the cold that seeped through the elevator's walls. [441] She had served Lady Vesper for years without understanding the woman's distant affection, the way she looked at servants with something like love held carefully at arm's length. [469] Now she recognized it as the same affectionate detachment her mother had written about, the careful distance of someone afraid to feel too deeply. [493]

The ninth floor brought Mira to her feet. [502] She pressed the goggles to her eyes and watched the final page of the diary reveal itself through scattered light, the symbols rearranging into a message that seemed written specifically for this moment. [536]

"My darling girl, if you have found these words, then you have learned to see what others cannot. [555] The observatory holds Lady Vesper's collection of preserved memories, each one waiting for someone brave enough to release them. [573] You will know what to do. [579] You have always known how to find joy beneath anguish, even in the frozen places where others see only ice." [599]

The elevator shuddered to a stop at the tenth floor. [609] Mira stepped into the observatory, where crystalline jars lined every shelf, each one containing a fragment of golden light. [628] Lady Vesper sat beside the window, aged and small, watching the endless sky with eyes that had forgotten how to hope. [650]

Mira approached with the diary open in her hands, the goggles warm against her chest. [666] She understood now that her years of service had been preparation, that every question she had asked had been practice for this moment. [689]

"My lady," she said softly, "I believe these memories are ready to come home." [703]

She lifted the first jar toward the window, and the light scattered through the ice, transforming grief into something luminous and alive. [724] Lady Vesper gasped, tears forming as forgotten joy touched her face like a daughter's hand. [741]

The ascending servant had finally reached the top, carrying light into the frozen places. [755] And somewhere in the clouds below, her mother's spirit smiled, knowing that joy, once released, could never truly be lost. [775]
