The mirrors in the abandoned funhouse still held light from fires that had burned out decades ago, their surfaces contaminated by a photographically cursed condition that trapped every terrified face that had ever screamed before them. [40] Vera moved through the tilted corridors, her footsteps echoing against warped floorboards, searching for the whispering advisor who had summoned her here three weeks after her resuscitation. [65]

She had drowned in the river, technically dead for seven minutes before the paramedics dragged her back. [81] Something had followed her from that cold darkness, a fear so complete it had nested in her chest like a living thing, feeding on her heartbeat. [103] The advisor had promised her a way to destroy it, but only if she came alone, only if she came here. [123]

"You're late," the voice slithered from everywhere and nowhere, a sound like dead leaves scraping against bone. [139] Vera turned and found him standing in a doorway that hadn't existed moments before, his form barely distinguishable from the shadows that birthed him. [160] He was repulsive in his beauty, his face shifting between expressions of hunger and tenderness, each transition nauseating to witness yet impossible to look away from. [184]

"You said you could help me unbosom this thing from my chest," Vera said, pressing her palm against her sternum where the fear pulsed like a second heart. [210]

The advisor smiled, revealing teeth that seemed to exist in too many dimensions. [224] "Fear is ancient and clever," he whispered, his voice threading through her ears like silk made of spider legs. [243] "It cannot be killed through courage or conquered through will. [253] It can only be tricked into revealing its weakness, and only then can you consume it as it has consumed you." [272]

He pressed something cold into her palm: an opera cloak clasp, tarnished silver shaped like a moth with wings of blackened pearl. [294] "This belonged to the last person who attempted what you seek," he continued. [307] "She failed because she approached fear with hatred. [315] You must approach it with seduction." [321]

From his coat, he produced a leather-bound book, its pages yellowed and stained with substances Vera chose not to identify. [340] "A dream dictionary," he explained, "but written through paradoxical notes. [351] Each definition contradicts itself, creating impossible spaces in the mind where fear cannot find footing." [365]

Vera opened the book and read: "Terror: the warmth of being truly seen. [377] Safety: the knife that never stops cutting." [384]

"Read three definitions before sleep," the advisor instructed. [392] "When you dream, your fear will manifest to investigate the disturbance. [403] In that space between meanings, you will see its true face, and there, its weakness will be exposed like a nerve." [422]

The mirrors around them flickered with their lingering luminance, those captured screams playing on loop in the cursed glass, faces stretched into expressions of beautiful agony. [445] Vera understood now why he had chosen this place, this funhouse where joy and horror had merged into something neither could survive alone. [467]

"What do you gain from helping me?" she asked. [476]

The advisor leaned close, his breath carrying the scent of forgotten flowers rotting in cemetery soil. [491] "I am what remains when fears die," he whispered against her ear. [503] "I feed on their corpses. [508] Your victory is my banquet." [513]

She should have been disgusted. [518] She was disgusted. [521] Yet she clasped the opera pin to her collar and tucked the dream dictionary under her arm, feeling something shift in her chest, the fear recognizing its predator had found a new ally. [552]

That night, Vera read the impossible definitions until language lost meaning. [563] She dreamed of the funhouse, but now she was the mirror, and the fear stood before her, forced to witness its own reflection for the first time. [588]

It was smaller than she expected, smaller than the space it had carved inside her. [603]

Its weakness was simple: it had never learned to fear itself. [614]

Vera smiled with borrowed teeth, felt the advisor's hunger merge with her own determination, and watched as the thing that had drowned with her began to shake. [639]

In the morning, she woke with an empty chest and a mouth that tasted of ash and victory. [658] The opera clasp gleamed on her nightstand, no longer tarnished, as if fed by what she had destroyed. [676]

Somewhere, in an abandoned funhouse, the mirrors captured one more face, but this one was smiling. [692] The lingering luminance grew brighter, adding Vera's triumph to its collection of eternal moments, beautiful and terrible, preserved forever in cursed silver glass. [714]

She never saw the whispering advisor again, but sometimes, in dreams, she heard him feeding in the dark places where fears went to die. [738]
