The greenhouse glass had yellowed from years of filtering the city's exhaust, casting everything in a saffron quiet that Mira found easier to breathe than the air outside. [31] She hadn't slept in four days, but her hands remained steady as she mixed pigments by the light of the waxing moon, its glow diffused through smog into something softer than it had any right to be. [67]

The rooftop garden belonged to no one anymore. [76] The building's owner had died seven years ago, and the tenants below had forgotten this place existed, overgrown with night-blooming jasmine and herbs that had outlived their gardener. [102] Mira had claimed it as her studio three months ago, hauling canvases up the rusted fire escape, methodically hopeful that isolation might cure what pills could not. [130]

Tonight she painted words. [134]

Not English, not any language still spoken. [142] She copied them from photographs she'd taken in abandoned churches, from gravestones in overgrown cemeteries, from the margins of water-damaged books she'd found in estate sales. [167] Lost languages fascinated her because they proved that entire ways of thinking could vanish, yet something always remained. [185] A fragment carved in stone. [190] A name no one could pronounce anymore. [198]

The brush she used had belonged to a calligrapher who'd lived in this building decades before. [214] Mira had found it in a crack between floorboards, its handle carved from bone, its tip shaped like a crescent moon that held ink the way cupped hands hold water. [245] She called it her moon-tipped brush, and she only used it for the dead words, the forgotten alphabets. [264]

Through the glass ceiling, the waxing moon climbed higher. [274] Its light fell across her canvas, and Mira felt the familiar drift begin, the state between waking and dreaming that insomnia eventually granted like a bitter gift. [302] Daydreams sparked by moonlight were the only rest she knew anymore. [314]

In the half-vision, she saw the calligrapher. [323] An old woman with ink-stained fingers, sitting where Mira sat now, before the greenhouse glass had yellowed, before the smog had thickened. [345] The woman was writing a letter in a script Mira almost recognized, and though no sound carried across the years, Mira understood the words were meant to rouse someone from despair. [376]

The vision shifted. [379] A young man reading that letter in a cramped apartment, tears cutting through the grime on his face. [395] He'd been a stranger to the calligrapher, just someone she'd seen crying on the bus. [412] She'd followed him home only to learn his address, then spent three days crafting a letter in the ornate script her grandmother had taught her, a language that had died with her village in a country that no longer existed under that name. [457]

The young man couldn't read the words. [465] But he'd understood the kindness. [471] Mira watched him pin the letter to his wall, watched him choose to live another day because a stranger had remembered he existed. [493]

She emerged from the daydream with moonlight still pooling on her canvas. [506] The brush had moved without her conscious guidance, painting the same script from the letter, words in a language that had stopped being spoken a century ago. [533]

Mira understood now why she couldn't sleep. [541] Her mind refused to rest until she finished this work, this proof that kindness echoed forward through time. [558] The calligrapher had saved a stranger with a dead language and a moon-tipped brush. [572] Decades later, another stranger had found that brush and begun painting lost words onto canvas. [587]

Tomorrow, Mira would hang her paintings in the stairwell of this forgotten building. [601] She would let the tenants discover them, let them wonder at the beautiful alien scripts they couldn't read. [617] Perhaps someone crying in their apartment would see one and feel, without understanding why, that a stranger had once thought they mattered enough to remember. [641]

The smog-filtered dawn began to lighten the eastern sky, but Mira kept painting. [656] Her eyes burned and her back ached, yet her heart felt methodically hopeful for the first time in months. [674] She was not creating art. [679] She was translating kindness across the barrier of years, proving that compassion could survive even when the languages that named it had been swallowed by time. [702]

The waxing moon faded into pale morning, but its work was done. [715] Mira set down the calligrapher's brush and finally felt tired enough to sleep. [729] In her dreams, she would see the old woman smiling, pleased that her brush had found another hand willing to write letters the world had forgotten how to read. [759]
