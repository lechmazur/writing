The last ship had sailed three hours ago, its lanterns fading into the gray mouth of the harbor like dying stars. [24] Margot remained in the palace garden, where autumn had turned the hedgerows to rust and the shadows stretched long beneath a copper sky. [47] She carried her leather satchel, worn soft from years of wandering, and inside it lay the tools of her peculiar trade: ink, paper, and the weight of words meant for the living. [78]

She wrote obituaries for people who still breathed. [86] Not predictions of death, but eulogies for the selves they had abandoned—the explained absences that haunted every life. [102] The merchant who once painted. [107] The mother who once sang. [112] The soldier who once believed in something softer than iron. [122] Margot chronicled these quiet deaths, these small vanishings, and in doing so helped people understand what they had lost before they could begin to find it again. [148]

The palace garden had been abandoned since the siege. [157] Weeds pushed through marble pathways, and the fountain stood dry, its basin filled with decomposing leaves. [172] Yet there was a lonesome splendor here, a beauty made more acute by its decay. [187] The roses still climbed, crimson against stone walls blackened by old fires. [199] The oak trees still held their dying leaves like offerings to an indifferent sky. [213]

Margot had come seeking the Countess. [219]

She found her kneeling by a collapsed trellis, her fingers working at something in the dirt. [234] The Countess did not startle when Margot approached. [242] Perhaps she had been expecting someone, or perhaps she had simply stopped expecting anything at all. [257]

"You're the obituary writer," the Countess said without looking up. [267] "They told me you might come after the ships left." [277]

"I go where the absences are," Margot replied, settling onto the cold ground beside her. [292] "And yours called loudly." [296]

The Countess finally looked at her, and Margot saw the geography of healing mapped across her face—the terrain of grief, the rivers of endurance, the mountains yet to be climbed. [326] Understanding that landscape was why Margot traveled, why she sought the broken and the bereft. [341] Each face taught her something about the journey from wound to scar. [353]

"I am pulling threads," the Countess said, gesturing to her work. [364] In her hands, she held a fragment of palace carpet, filthy and water-damaged, salvaged from the ruins. [380] She was separating the weft threads from the warp, each strand a different color—amber, wine, deep forest green. [396]

"This carpet covered the throne room floor the night my son was born," she continued. [410] "And the night he was taken from me." [418] Her voice remained steady, vividly descriptive as she spoke of flames, of soldiers, of a boy too young to understand why his world was burning. [439] "He would be seventeen now. [444] I don't know if he's alive. [450] That's why you've come, isn't it? [456] To write the death of my hope?" [462]

Margot reached out, her hand covering the Countess's. [470] The gesture was intimate, tender in a way that surprised them both. [482] "No," she said softly. [486] "I write the deaths of the selves we cannot carry any longer. [498] The woman who waited by the harbor—she died tonight when the last ship left without word. [514] I'm here to write her obituary so you can become someone new. [527] Someone who can live with not knowing." [534]

The Countess's fingers stilled on the carpet thread. [541] "How do you do this work?" she asked. [549] "How do you bear so much sorrow?" [556]

Margot smiled, though her eyes remained sad. [563] "By projecting presence," she answered. [568] "I make myself fully here, in this moment, with this person. [580] Your grief becomes something we carry together, just for a while. [592] And in that sharing, it transforms." [598]

She took the weft thread from the Countess's hand—a single strand of amber silk, impossibly beautiful despite its age and damage. [618] "May I keep this? [622] For the obituary." [625]

The Countess nodded. [628]

They sat together as night descended over the shadowed garden, autumn wind stirring the dead leaves around them. [645] Margot began to write by the last gray light, her pen moving across the page in vividly descriptive strokes, chronicling the woman the Countess had been—the waiting woman, the hoping woman, the woman who counted ships. [682]

When she finished, she read the words aloud, and the Countess wept. [694]

But when morning came, she also rose. [701]

Margot wound the amber thread around her satchel strap, one more explained absence carried forward. [716] She walked toward the next harbor, the next ship, the next geography of healing waiting to be understood. [734]

Behind her, the Countess began to clear the garden. [743]
