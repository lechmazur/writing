The package arrived on a Tuesday, wrapped in kelp and barnacles, addressed to no one living. [17]

Ezra Crane had been an undertaker for forty years, his hands intimate with the silence of the departed, his shoulders bent from carrying grief that was never his own. [44] When he opened the mysterious parcel, saltwater pooled on his workbench, and inside lay the shattered remains of a lighthouse lens, its prismatic fragments still catching light that seemed to come from nowhere. [74]

He should have thrown it away. [80] That would have been the sensible thing. [87] But Ezra was inadvertently stubborn in ways he never recognized in himself—he simply couldn't abandon broken things that had once served a purpose. [108] The lens had guided ships home, and now it sat orphaned in his mortuary, sending fractured rainbows across the faces of the dead. [130]

That night, the fragments began to pulse. [137] Not with light, but with something deeper—a rhythm like a heartbeat transmitted through water, a distress signal from somewhere impossible. [156] Ezra pressed his palm against the largest shard and felt the ocean rush into his lungs, not drowning him but filling him with coordinates to a place that shouldn't exist. [184]

He descended through dreams or death or something between. [193] The forgotten underwater city library rose before him, its spires crusted with coral, its windows illuminated by bioluminescent fish that swam through reading rooms where books had become reefs. [221] Ezra found he could breathe here, move here, exist in ways that defied the architecture of reality—occupying impossible spaces between the shelves where geometry bent like grief. [248]

The library's inhabitants were not ghosts, exactly, but not the living either. [260] They were the unburied—sailors and swimmers and seekers who had drowned before anyone could give their deaths proper witness. [278] They drifted between the stacks, searching for something they couldn't name, their faces wearing the same exhausted expression Ezra saw in his own mirror each morning. [303]

He understood immediately why the lens had called to him. [313] These souls had been sending distress signals for centuries, their lighthouse destroyed by the same storm that claimed them, their light scattered into fragments that washed ashore across the world. [342] Without the lens to guide them, they couldn't find their way to rest. [355]

"I bury people," Ezra said to the eldest among them, a woman whose hair floated like seaweed around her hollow face. [374] "That's all I know how to do." [381]

"Then bury us," she replied. [385] "Give rest a permanent address." [390]

For seven nights—or what felt like nights in a place where the sun never reached—Ezra worked among the drowned. [408] He learned their names from the library's waterlogged records, pieced together their stories from faded passenger manifests and captain's logs. [427] Each name he spoke aloud seemed to revitalize something in the corresponding spirit, their transparency solidifying slightly, their aimless drifting taking on direction. [449]

The broken lens became whole again as he worked, each funeral rite fusing another fragment. [463] Ezra moved through the impossible architecture of the library, finding souls tucked into spaces that couldn't exist—between pages that opened into rooms, inside words that contained entire chambers. [491] His weariness deepened with each burial, but so did his sense of purpose. [504]

When the last soul found peace, the lens blazed once with golden light, a beacon that illuminated a path upward through the black water. [526] The library began to settle, its restless energy finally still, its books closing like eyes at the end of a long vigil. [548]

Ezra surfaced in his own mortuary, dawn light streaming through windows he'd forgotten existed. [562] The lens sat on his workbench, intact now, no longer signaling distress but simply catching the morning sun and scattering it into quiet colors. [584]

He placed it on the shelf beside his other artifacts—tokens from funerals that had mattered more than most, reminders that his work had weight. [607] For the first time in decades, the exhaustion in his bones felt earned rather than endless. [622]

The drowned had found their rest, and in guiding them there, Ezra had finally stopped running from his own stillness. [641] He sat in his chair, let the chased silence catch him at last, and understood that some things must be buried before they can be kept. [667]

The lighthouse lens glowed faintly in the morning light, its purpose fulfilled, its distress finally answered by a weary man who had simply refused to abandon broken things. [695]

Outside, the ocean breathed against distant shores, and somewhere beneath the waves, a library slept in peace, its impossible shelves empty at last of the wandering dead. [724]
