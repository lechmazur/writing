The mechanical birds shrieked their copper warnings as Maren descended the cliffside labyrinth, her breath visible in the dying light. [22] She carried nothing but a small nut tucked into her coat pocket, the last harvest from the orchard she'd never wanted to tend. [43]

Three years ago, her grandmother had died and left Maren the twisted grove of hazel trees that grew where no hazels should, their roots drinking from cursed groundwater that made the nuts bitter and strange. [74] She'd tried to abandon it twice, but the orchard called her back each time with dreams of travelers lost in darkness, their voices pleading through her sleep. [99]

Tonight, those voices had a source. [105]

The labyrinth carved into the cliff face had been built centuries ago by engineers whose names history had swallowed. [121] Now only their creation remained: a maze of narrow paths and false turns, patrolled by mechanical birds that swooped and clicked their brass beaks at anyone who strayed too close to the edge. [152] The birds had been guardians once. [158] Now they were simply obstacles, their original purpose corrupted by centuries of neglect. [170]

Maren moved with offhandedly exact precision, her steps measured without conscious thought, the result of navigating uneven orchard ground since childhood. [189] She'd memorized this labyrinth during her first year as caretaker, understanding instinctively that the cursed trees had some connection to this place. [210] The groundwater that fed her orchard flowed from these cliffs. [221]

"Hello?" a voice called from somewhere below. [228]

"Stay where you are," Maren shouted back. [235] "The frost comes soon, and the paths ice over. [244] Follow my voice." [247]

She couldn't see them yet, the travelers who'd wandered into this maze seeking shelter from the approaching cold. [263] Every autumn brought a few, drawn by old maps that promised a shortcut to the valley towns. [280] The maps never mentioned the mechanical birds or the paths that led nowhere but empty air. [295]

Maren reached into her pocket and withdrew the small nut. [305] Its shell had darkened to near-black, and when she held it against the cliff wall without making contact, it left an impression in the stone, a faint luminescent mark that glowed green in the gathering dusk. [342] This was the curse's gift, if gifts could be called such things. [355] The nuts from her orchard could leave impressions without touching, marking paths through darkness for those who needed guidance. [372]

She'd discovered the forgotten blueprint in her grandmother's cellar last winter, yellowed diagrams showing how the mechanical birds and the hazel grove had once worked together. [395] The birds were meant to respond to the nuts' marks, to guide travelers rather than menace them. [412] Someone had broken that connection generations ago. [419]

Tonight, Maren intended to assemble what remained. [426]

She moved deeper into the labyrinth, pressing the nut near each wall she passed, leaving a trail of ghostly light. [445] The mechanical birds circled overhead, their copper wings catching the last sunlight. [458] They clicked and whirred, confused by signals they almost remembered how to read. [471]

"I see something," the traveler called. [477] "Green light on the walls." [482]

"Follow it upward," Maren said. [487] "Don't stop, not even when the birds dive close. [496] They won't hurt you if you stay on the lit path." [507]

She didn't know if that was true. [514] But the birds were already changing their pattern, swooping toward the marked walls instead of the traveler, their ancient programming stirring back to life. [536]

The first ice crystals began forming on the stone as Maren climbed. [548] She could see them now: a woman and a child, huddled at an intersection where three paths diverged into darkness. [568] Only one path glowed. [572]

"Up," Maren said, reaching down. [577] "Before the night frost forms. [582] It's not far now." [586]

The woman grasped her hand, and Maren pulled them both onto the lit path. [600] Above them, the mechanical birds settled onto their ancient perches, silent for the first time in decades. [616]

They emerged at the cliff's edge as the last light failed, the valley spread below them in graceless beauty, all sharp angles and honest ugliness, bare trees and stone houses waiting for winter. [650] It wasn't pretty. [653] But it was safe. [657]

"Thank you," the woman whispered. [661]

Maren nodded, already thinking of the orchard waiting for her return, its cursed trees heavy with bitter nuts that could light the way for whoever wandered lost next autumn. [692] She'd never wanted to be its caretaker. [699] But some burdens chose their bearers, and some purposes revealed themselves only in darkness, one glowing mark at a time. [718]

The mechanical birds sang their first true song in centuries as Maren turned toward home. [733]
