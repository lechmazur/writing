The carousel had stopped three days ago, or perhaps three years. Mira could no longer tell the difference. [18]

She crouched at the edge of the kinetic lagoon, watching the luminescent waters churn above the cloudline, driven by mechanisms no one remembered how to repair. [42] The floating debris caught in its perpetual motion held everything she needed to survive: scraps of metal, fragments of old machines, pieces of lives that had tumbled from the sky platforms above. [71] She was a resolute scavenger, the last one willing to wade into those glowing currents where time moved strangely and memory grew slippery. [93]

In her palm sat today's find: a disposable camera wheel, its serrated edge worn smooth by the lagoon's endless circulation. [112] She turned it over, watching light catch the teeth that once advanced film frame by frame, capturing moments that no longer existed anywhere but in chemical ghosts. [138]

"You wanted to be a photographer once," said the voice behind her. [150]

Mira didn't turn around. [154] She knew what she'd see: herself, but younger, sharper, with eyes that still believed the carousel would spin forever. [173]

"That was before," Mira said. [178]

"Before what?" [180]

"Before I understood that ambitions erode like everything else up here." [190]

The ghost stepped closer, and Mira felt the familiar cold that preceded these negotiations. [204] She had been collecting fragments of overheard stories for months now, whispered conversations that drifted up from the cloud layers below, hoping to find the right words to finally settle this debt with her former self. [240]

Yesterday, or perhaps last week, she had heard an old man telling his grandson about regret. [256] "It's not the mistakes that haunt you," he'd said, his voice carried on thermals. [271] "It's the person you stopped being to avoid making more of them." [284]

The ghost sat beside her now, dangling translucent legs over the lagoon's edge. [297] "You remember when we came here first? [304] The carousel was still running. [309] All those golden horses rising and falling, and you said you'd capture every revolution until you understood its secret." [327]

"I was chronologically confused even then," Mira admitted. [335] "I thought time was something you could hold, like the lagoon holds debris. [348] I didn't know it would start slipping through me instead." [358]

The kinetic lagoon surged, throwing phosphorescent spray across their faces. [368] Only Mira's skin grew wet. [373]

She had tried so many times to negotiate with this specter of ambition. [386] Each attempt ended the same way: the ghost would demand she remember what she'd wanted, and Mira would offer instead the practical wisdom of survival. [411] Neither would yield. [414] The fractured stillness between them grew wider each time, a silence made of all the photographs never taken, all the stories never told. [435]

But the overheard fragment had given her something new. [444]

"I regret," Mira said slowly, tasting the word like something foreign. [455] "Not that I stopped being you. [461] I regret that I pretended the stopping was a choice." [471]

The ghost flickered, its edges growing less defined. [479]

"The carousel halted and I told myself I chose to become this." [492] She held up the camera wheel. [498] "A collector of broken things instead of a maker of images. [510] But ambition doesn't erode from wisdom. [516] It erodes from fear." [520]

"Then why keep scavenging?" the ghost asked, and for the first time its voice carried something other than accusation. [537]

Mira thought of all those fragments of stories she'd gathered, each one someone else's truth drifting upward through the clouds. [556] She had told herself she collected them for survival, for barter, for understanding how to navigate this suspended world. [573] But perhaps she had been assembling something else entirely. [582]

"Because even broken wheels turn," she said. [589] "Given the right current." [593]

She stood, pocketing the camera wheel, and finally looked directly at her ghost. [606] The face was still hers, still young, still burning with the desire to capture light and meaning. [622]

"I can't become you again," Mira said. [629] "But maybe I can stop pretending I never was." [638]

The ghost smiled, the first smile in all their negotiations. [648] "That's all I wanted to hear." [654]

It dissolved into the lagoon's spray, joining the other fragments caught in perpetual motion above the clouds. [670]

Mira watched the waters churn, holding debris that had once been something else, would perhaps become something else again. [688] Somewhere far below, she heard voices rising, new stories she might collect, new words she might finally use as her own. [709]

The carousel remained still, its golden horses frozen mid-stride. [718] But the lagoon never stopped moving, and neither, Mira decided, would she. [730]
