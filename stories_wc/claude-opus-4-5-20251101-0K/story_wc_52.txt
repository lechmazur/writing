The kettle began its slow climb toward singing, and Marguerite settled into the worn leather chair beneath the rain-beaded skylight, letting the gray light wash over her hands and the ash wood carving blank she held. [43]

Three years since Viktor had stepped into the ring for the last time, and still she could smell the sawdust and musk that had clung to his skin. [70] Here and gone, she thought, the way all things eventually become. [82] But not yet forgotten. [86]

The loft had been his studio once, where he'd crafted the wooden props for his act—the hoops the lions leaped through, the pedestals they posed upon. [111] Now it was hers, transformed into something hauntingly practical: a workshop where she taught grief to hold still. [128]

The ash wood warmed in her palms, its grain tight and patient. [141] She had learned that mourning needed a container, something to hold the shapeless weight before it crushed you. [158] Viktor had known this instinctively, channeling his fear of the beasts he tamed into the careful motions of his hands across wood. [180] She had watched him work for twenty-seven years, never quite understanding until he was gone. [195]

Rain tapped against the skylight in irregular rhythms, and Marguerite thought of the first lesson she had harvested from loss: that time does not heal, it crystallizes. [222] Moments that once flowed liquid and impossible to grasp became solid, could be turned over and examined, could be shaped into something that fit in the palm. [249]

She picked up her smallest gouge and began to carve, following a form only she could see inside the pale wood. [270]

The kettle's voice rose slightly, still minutes from its full cry. [282] Enough time. [284] Always just enough time. [288]

Her students would arrive in the afternoon—other widows, mostly, some widowers, a few who had lost children or parents or the versions of themselves they'd been before illness rewrote them. [317] She taught them to carve because Viktor had taught her, though he'd never meant to. [333] She had simply watched, and watching had seeped into her hands. [345]

The form emerging from the ash wood was a lion, of course. [358] It was always a lion, though each one came out different. [370] This one had Viktor's calm around its eyes, that particular stillness he'd worn when facing a creature that could kill him with one swipe. [393] He had never been afraid in the way others imagined—he had simply contained his fear, made it useful, made it a tool for paying attention. [418]

The grief she carried now was like that, she had learned. [430] Here and gone, it moved through her in waves, but she no longer drowned. [445] She contained it in these small wooden forms, crystallized it through the slow work of blade against grain. [463]

Outside, October painted the city in rust and amber, the colors bleeding through rain-streaked glass. [477] The loft held that same hue—weathered brick walls, copper pipes greening with age, the warm brown of sawdust gathered in corners. [498] A rust-hued peace had settled over her life, not the bright joy of before but something sturdy, something that could bear weight. [521]

The kettle began to whistle, and Marguerite set down her tools. [533] The lion was rough yet, barely suggested in the blank's surface, but it was there. [549] It would wait for her, patient as the wood from which it emerged, patient as the dead who asked nothing but remembrance. [571]

She rose and crossed to the small kitchen alcove, her joints protesting the cold. [586] The tea she made was strong and black, the way Viktor had taken it after performances, when the adrenaline still buzzed beneath his skin. [608] She carried the cup back to her chair, let the steam rise between her face and the gray skylight. [628]

Tomorrow she would work on the lion's mane, each strand a moment preserved. [642] Her students would bring their own blanks, their own formless griefs, and she would show them how to make something that could be held. [666]

The rain continued its soft percussion overhead. [674] Marguerite sipped her tea and watched the light shift through water droplets, each one a tiny lens containing the whole sky, here and gone between one breath and the next. [702]

This was what she had harvested from loss: the knowledge that nothing truly disappears, it only changes form. [720] Viktor lived now in her careful hands, in the lions she released from wood, in the quiet she had learned to love. [742]

The cup warmed her palms the way the ash wood had, and she thought perhaps this was enough. [760] Perhaps this had always been enough. [767]
