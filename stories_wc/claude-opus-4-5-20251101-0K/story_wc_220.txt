The bloodhound's nose had long since forgotten the scent of decay. [12]

Marta crouched in the shell of a gutted refrigerator, her graying muzzle twitching at dust instead of death, and watched the sunrise paint the scrapyard settlement in shades of rust and amber. [44] After the last resource war, nobody needed a body-finder anymore. [54] The dead were everywhere, and the living had stopped counting. [64]

She had retired from finding corpses the day she realized she was searching for something else entirely—some trace of the daughter who had vanished into the eastern wastelands three winters ago. [93]

The settlement of Crag Hollow sprawled across a cracked wasteland like a wound that refused to heal, its towers of compressed cars and sheet metal homes casting long shadows over paths worn smooth by desperate feet. [127] A wild hush pervaded everything here, the silence of a world holding its breath, punctuated only by the creak of settling debris and the whisper of wind through hollow pipes. [157]

Marta descended from her perch, her joints protesting with each movement, and made her way toward the Archive—a half-buried shipping container where Old Ven kept his collection of pre-war artifacts. [188]

"You're back," Ven said without turning. [194] His fingers, intuitively descriptive in their movements, traced the grooves of a phonograph cylinder he held to the light. [211] "I found something." [214]

The cylinder was brass, tarnished green in places, and covered in scratches that Marta had once dismissed as damage. [231] But Ven had spent weeks studying them, discovering that they weren't scratches at all. [245]

"Secret texts," he murmured. [249] "Someone used these grooves to hide messages. [256] Layer them over the music, encode them in the spaces between notes." [267] By reading secret texts in the grooves of a phonograph cylinder, he had uncovered fragments of old communication networks—routes, safe houses, messages between survivors. [291]

And one name: Sera. [295]

Marta's daughter. [297]

"She left you a riddle," Ven said, finally turning to face her. [308] His weathered face was kind but cautious. [315] "Or a test, maybe. [319] Something to prove you're really you." [326]

He handed her a scrap of paper where he'd transcribed the words: [337]

What I kept to remember the end of growing things, you will find where metal dreams of being earth again. [356]

Marta's breath caught. [359] Sera had always been fascinated by transformation, by the way the world recycled itself even as humans tore it apart. [378] And she remembered—god, how she remembered—the autumn leaf. [388]

When Sera was seven, just before the final resource war erupted, she had preserved an autumn leaf in wax, sealing its red-gold brilliance against time's decay. [416] Marta had laughed at the careful, serious way her daughter had worked, explaining that she wanted to keep something beautiful before beauty became impossible. [440]

Metal dreams of being earth again. [446]

The compost pit. [449]

Every settlement had one—a place where they buried scrap too corroded to use, hoping rust and time would return it to soil. [472] Crag Hollow's pit lay at the settlement's western edge, a depression filled with oxidizing fragments that bled orange into the surrounding clay. [495]

Marta ran. [497]

Her old bloodhound instincts fired despite years of disuse, her nose catching not death but life—traces of recent passage, disturbed earth, the faint organic sweetness of someone who had been here within the season. [532]

She dug where the scent was strongest, her paws throwing aside flakes of rust and soil until they struck metal. [550] A box. [552] Inside, wrapped in oilcloth, lay the autumn leaf preserved in wax, its amber perfection unchanged after fifteen years. [569]

Beneath it, a map. [573]

The tinted revelations came slowly as Marta traced the marked routes—coordinates leading east, through territories she had believed impassable. [592] Her daughter hadn't vanished. [596] She had been building a path, leaving breadcrumbs only Marta could follow, using their shared memories as a cipher. [613]

Sera was translating distance into closeness, collapsing the impossible miles between them into steps her mother could take. [631]

Marta pressed the waxed leaf to her chest, feeling its edges through the oilcloth, and looked east toward the horizon where the cracked wasteland met the colorless sky. [661] The wild hush of Crag Hollow seemed to deepen around her, as if the world itself was waiting for her decision. [683]

She had spent years finding bodies, following the dead to their final rest. [696] Now, for the first time since the war ended, she would follow the living. [711]

Marta gathered the map, the leaf, and the last of her courage, and began walking toward a daughter who had never stopped believing her mother would come. [740]

Behind her, the scrapyard settlement continued its slow transformation, metal dreaming of earth, and somewhere ahead, a girl waited with answers written in grooves and autumn gold. [769]
