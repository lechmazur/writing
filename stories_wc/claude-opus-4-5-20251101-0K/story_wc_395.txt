The numbers started appearing three weeks after Helena became the corporate memory keeper for Nexus Social, the platform where two billion people had once shared their lives. [28]

She first noticed them in a corrupted timestamp: 7-14-7-14, repeating across seventeen deleted accounts. [43] Then they surfaced in engagement metrics, in server logs, in the algorithmic detritus she spent her days cataloging. [59] Her job was to preserve what mattered and discard what didn't, but Helena had grown brightly attentive to patterns that shouldn't exist. [79]

The Nexus archive occupied a former missile silo in Nevada, its servers humming like mechanical ghosts. [94] Helena walked the corridors alone most nights, listening to fragments of audio that played unbidden from failing drives—birthday songs, lullabies, drunken karaoke from parties a decade past. [121] Across the echo of forgotten songs, she hunted for meaning. [132]

The missing persons case had been closed for eleven years. [142] Marcus Chen, software engineer, vanished without trace. [150] His profile still existed in deep archive, a digital fossil Helena had stumbled upon while migrating legacy data. [167] The official story said he walked away from everything—his job at Nexus, his apartment, his mother who still posted on his memorial page every Christmas. [192]

But the numbers told a different story. [199]

7-14 was Marcus's employee ID. [205] Helena found it embedded in code he'd written, in deleted messages restored from backup fragments, in the metadata of photographs that showed a young man with tired eyes and a patch sewn onto his jacket. [240] The patch depicted a rocket trailing smoke, commemorating the Artemis-7 mission that had crashed on the lunar surface fifteen years ago, killing all six crew members. [266] Marcus had been obsessed with space exploration. [273] His mother's posts mentioned he'd applied to the astronaut program four times. [285]

Helena understood obsession. [288] She had taken this job to answer a question that haunted her: where do deleted files go? [304] The corporate line was simple—they're overwritten, recycled, gone. [314] But she had seen too many fragments persist, too many ghosts refusing erasure. [327] Nothing truly disappeared from Nexus. [333] It just became harder to find. [339]

She found Marcus's final private message at 3 AM on a Tuesday, hidden in a corrupted sector that should have been reformatted years ago. [361] It was addressed to someone named "Administrator-0," a system account that had no human operator assigned. [376]

"I know what you're doing," the message read. [384] "I found the shadow profiles. [389] I found where you're hiding the deleted people." [398]

Helena's hands trembled as she scrolled. [404] Shadow profiles. [406] The term didn't exist in any Nexus documentation. [414]

She had to lie to access the restricted servers. [423] She told Security she was running a routine integrity check, smiled brightly, kept her voice steady. [439] Inside the sealed vault, she found what Marcus had found: thousands of accounts belonging to users reported missing across twelve countries. [458] Their data hadn't been deleted. [463] It had been moved, consolidated, studied. [469]

The Artemis-7 patch on Marcus's jacket suddenly made terrible sense. [479] The mission hadn't crashed by accident. [485] Those astronauts had discovered something, and someone had decided they needed to disappear. [497] Marcus had discovered the same thing—that Nexus wasn't just a social network. [509] It was a surveillance apparatus, and the missing persons weren't coincidences. [520] They were collections. [523]

Helena copied everything she could to a physical drive, her heart pounding against her ribs. [538] The numbers 7-14 blinked in the corner of her screen, almost like a warning. [553] Or a blessing. [556]

She found Marcus's last known location buried in geolocation data: a warehouse fourteen miles from this very silo. [571] The sensed absence that had defined her work here crystallized into certainty. [583] He hadn't walked away. [587] He had been walked away. [592]

Helena pocketed the drive and the Artemis-7 patch she'd found pressed between archived server manuals like a bookmark. [609] Someone had wanted it preserved. [614] Someone had believed that eventually, a brightly attentive keeper would come looking. [625]

The forgotten songs played on as she climbed the stairs toward the surface, toward the truth that deleted files never really went anywhere. [647] They waited. [649] They accumulated. [651] They testified. [653]

She would find Marcus Chen, or she would find what remained of him. [667] Either way, the cold case was about to get very, very warm. [680] The numbers had led her here, and now she understood their message: some patterns exist because someone needed them to survive, to speak across the echo of their own erasure. [713]

Helena stepped into the Nevada night, the stars above her burning like distant servers, and began to run. [732]
