The cobalt terrace stretched toward the darkening horizon, its blue tiles catching the last amber light of dusk as Maren settled into her ritual. [26] She had come here every evening for three weeks now, since the letter arrived—the one that had unraveled everything she thought she knew about her work. [52]

For twelve years, she had been the best black market genealogist in the northern territories, manufacturing false memories for clients who needed new pasts. [73] A refugee seeking asylum could suddenly produce three generations of documented citizenship. [84] A criminal could vanish into a fabricated lineage stretching back to respectable merchants. [95] She had believed herself a liberator, freeing people from histories that trapped them. [107]

But the letter had revealed the other side of her transactions. [118]

A woman named Elise Varen had hired Maren seven years ago to erase her daughter from family records, to manufacture memories suggesting the child had never existed. [143] Maren hadn't asked questions then—she never did. [152] Now she knew that Elise's daughter, abandoned and identity-stripped, had spent years searching for proof of her own existence before walking into the winter sea. [176]

Maren descended the terrace steps toward the forgotten shore below, where driftwood accumulated in silver piles along the tide line. [195] This had become her penance: sifting through driftwood carvings along a forgotten shore, searching for something she couldn't name. [214] The beach had once been a sculptor's retreat, and fragments of abandoned art washed up daily—faces half-formed, hands reaching, figures twisted by salt and time. [238]

She worked in what she called the sieved hush, that particular silence that fell when the waves pulled back and the wind died, leaving only the sound of her own breathing and the whisper of wood against wood. [275] Each piece she examined felt like a confession she was afraid to make. [288]

Tonight, her fingers found something different among the fragments. [297] A carved hand, delicate and feminine, clutched a broken watch hand—the hour indicator snapped clean, frozen at some moment that would never arrive. [319] The craftsmanship was remarkable, the wooden fingers curled around the metal with desperate precision. [333]

Time stopped, Maren thought. [337] Someone carved this to show how time stops. [345]

The weight of unspoken words pressed down on her as she sat in the sand, cradling the carving. [363] She had never told anyone about her guilt—not her sister, not the few friends who still called, not the priests who sometimes wandered the terrace seeking converts. [390] She had swallowed her confession like a stone and felt it growing heavier each day. [406]

The withheld truth was simple: she had known, hadn't she? [417] When Elise Varen had come to her with cold eyes and a trembling signature, Maren had sensed something cruel in the transaction. [438] But the money had been exceptional, and she had told herself that her role was mechanical, that she merely arranged papers and suggested memories. [461] She had not asked what would happen to the erased girl because she had not wanted to know. [479]

Now she needed to discover the weight of that withheld truth—to hold it fully, to stop letting it poison her in increments. [500]

The carved hand seemed to pulse in the dying light. [510] Maren realized she was weeping, something she had not done since childhood. [523] The sieved hush surrounded her, that silence between waves that felt like the pause between heartbeats, and in that space she finally spoke aloud. [548]

"I helped erase her," she said to the empty shore. [559] "I made her nobody." [563]

The words did not quell her guilt—nothing could do that entirely. [574] But speaking them aloud began to loosen the grip that had been strangling her for weeks. [590] She understood now that she would have to find the girl's real family, the ones who might still remember her. [610] She would have to use her terrible skills in reverse, to reconstruct what she had helped destroy. [627]

Maren climbed back up to the cobalt terrace as the first stars emerged. [640] She placed the carved hand on the tiles, the broken watch hand still clutched in its wooden fingers. [657] It would remind her of stopped time, of moments that demanded attention, of the work ahead. [673]

The tempered regret she felt was not absolution—she knew she deserved none. [686] But it was honest, and honesty was the one thing she had never offered her clients or herself. [704]

Tomorrow she would begin searching for the people who had loved the girl before Elise Varen erased her. [721] She would give them back what fragments she could find. [732] It would not be enough, but it would be true, and truth was the only currency she had left that wasn't counterfeit. [754]

The dusk deepened into night, and Maren sat with her grief, finally willing to carry its full weight. [772]
