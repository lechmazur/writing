The year the Bureau of Cognitive Revenue began taxing thoughts was the year Marcus Chen discovered that gourd rattles could carry secrets. [24]

He stood in Dr. Amelia Voss's greenhouse, surrounded by glass walls that sweated with humidity and terrariums housing beetles from six continents. [45] The entomologist had been dead three months now, but her collection thrived, mandibles clicking in the filtered light like a chorus of tiny conspirators. [68] Marcus rolled the single gourd rattle seed between his fingers, feeling its ridged surface, the promise coiled inside its shell. [87]

"You're candidly cryptic, you know that?" [93] Sofia Reyes appeared between rows of praying mantis enclosures, her gardening gloves stained with soil from the community plot two blocks north. [114] "You told me to come here but not why. [123] You said it was urgent but smiled like you had all the time in the world." [138]

"Because I do have time," Marcus replied, his scholar's mind already calculating angles, his rogue's heart already measuring escape routes. [156] "Time is the one thing they haven't figured out how to tax yet. [169] Thoughts, yes. [171] Dreams, pending legislation. [174] But time remains free, and we're going to use every second of it." [186]

The Bureau's neural monitors had made silence the only refuge. [196] Think too loudly about dissent, and you'd find the charge on your monthly statement. [211] Marcus had watched his university colleagues lobotomize their own curiosity, afraid of the fees accumulating behind their foreheads. [228] But Marcus had always been too charming for his own good, too convinced that knowledge belonged to those bold enough to chase it. [251]

He needed to warp reality, to bend the Bureau's surveillance into a shape they wouldn't recognize. [266]

"Dr. Voss left me this seed," he said, holding it up to catch the light filtering through atlas moth wings pressed against glass. [290] "And these instructions." [293] He produced a worn notebook, filled with diagrams of garden plots, planting schedules, and what looked like choreography for vegetables. [312]

Sofia's eyes widened. [315] "The Secret Language Club. [318] I thought that was just a rumor, something the old resistance started before—" [330]

"Before thoughts became currency? [334] It was real. [337] Dr. Voss was a founding member." [343] Marcus flipped to a page showing aerial views of community gardens across the city. [356] "They developed a system. [360] Plant patterns that spelled messages, visible only from above, readable only by those who knew the code. [377] Gourd rattles were their punctuation marks—rare enough to stand out, common enough not to raise suspicion." [394]

The greenhouse hummed with insect life, a converging chaos of wings and legs and hungry mouths. [410] A death's-head hawkmoth battered against its enclosure, drawn to the single lamp Marcus had lit. [426] Everything was converging now: the Bureau's tightening grip, the scattered remnants of the old resistance, the desperate need to think freely again. [446]

"Why me?" Sofia asked. [450]

"Because you've been joining community gardens all over the city for two years." [463] Marcus smiled his charming smile, the one that had talked him out of three expulsions and into two forbidden archives. [481] "You thought you were just growing tomatoes. [488] But you were building infrastructure." [493]

She stared at him, then at the seed, then at the notebook's intricate diagrams. [506] Understanding bloomed across her face like morning glories opening. [515]

"We stand guard," Marcus said softly, "over our own spark of defiance. [526] That's what Dr. Voss wrote on the last page. [535] The Bureau can tax what we think, but they can't tax what we grow. [549] Not yet." [551]

The beetles clicked. [554] The moths stirred. [557] Somewhere in the city, a community garden waited for its first encoded message, spelled in squash and corn and single gourd rattle plants that would shake their seeds like whispered warnings. [587]

Sofia pulled off her gloves and reached for the seed. [597] "Show me the alphabet." [601]

Marcus opened the notebook to page one, where consonants were carrots and vowels were climbing beans. [616] The chaos of the greenhouse pressed around them, life refusing to be cataloged, categorized, controlled. [631] Dr. Voss's insects continued their secret songs, and Marcus began to teach Sofia a language the Bureau's algorithms would never decode. [652]

By spring, he thought, the gardens would bloom with rebellion. [663] By summer, the patterns would warp across the city like a virus of hope. [677] By fall, maybe—just maybe—thoughts would be free again. [687]

But that was tomorrow's revolution. [692]

Tonight, there was only the seed, the scholar, and the slow patient work of planting something the taxmen couldn't touch. [712]
