The coachman arrived at the blooming jetty as the last light bled from the sky, his lantern unnecessary against the phosphorescent flowers that had colonized every plank and piling. [31] He had not driven passengers for three years now—not since the reef died and the coastal road collapsed into the sea, taking Gloom Hill's last connection to the mainland with it. [62]

His name was Erasmus, though no one remained who used it. [72] The war had seen to that, just as it had seen to the fishing village, the lighthouse keeper's family, and the young soldiers who had turned the eastern headland into a mass grave. [101] Now he walked the jetty each evening, speaking to the birds in tongues no human throat had shaped for centuries. [120]

The cormorants understood Sumerian best. [125] He had learned this through patient observation, noting how they tilted their heads when he pronounced the guttural consonants, how they responded with specific calls that mapped onto meanings he was only beginning to comprehend. [154] The terns preferred Akkadian, the herons a dialect of Linear B that he had reconstructed from fragments and intuition. [172] Each species carried messages between the submerged reef and the shore, maintaining a concord that predated human memory. [189]

Erasmus reached into his coat and withdrew the leather pouch that held his collection of dried seed pods. [205] Thirty-seven varieties, gathered from the battlefield's edge where wild things had begun their slow reconquest of the trenches. [223] Poppy and thistle, clover and vetch, each pod containing the promise of something green rising from ground that had drunk too much blood. [245]

A cormorant landed on the nearest piling and made a sound like stones grinding underwater. [260] Erasmus listened, then responded in careful Sumerian, asking about the nitrogen content of the water, the mineral deposits the dying reef had left behind. [283] The bird's answer came in a series of clicks and whistles that he translated slowly, nodding as comprehension formed. [301]

The reef's death had released something. [307] Calcium, phosphorus, the accumulated life of ten thousand years dissolving into the current that swept past the jetty. [323] The flowers that now grew from every surface were the first sign—not planted by any hand, but summoned by the sea's new chemistry. [345] The birds had shown him how to read this transformation, how to understand that death on such a scale created conditions for unprecedented growth. [368]

He opened his pouch and selected a cluster of vetch pods, their surfaces wrinkled like ancient skin. [384] The terns had told him where the current would carry seeds if he released them at this hour, in this season. [403] They would drift toward the eastern headland, settle into the churned earth where two hundred young men had died in a single morning. [424]

Erasmus crushed the pods between his palms, letting the seeds fall into the glowing water. [438] This was how he would fertilize the battlefield—not with blood meal or bone char, but with the reef's dissolved remains, carried by tides the birds could predict with perfect accuracy. [467] The narrow vastness of the twilight sea stretched before him, infinite yet contained between the jetty's weathered rails. [484]

Each evening he performed this ritual. [490] Each morning he walked the headland and found new shoots pushing through the rusted wire and shattered stone. [507] The garden would take years to fully establish, perhaps decades, but time had become irrelevant since the last coach departed Gloom Hill. [528]

A heron descended, spoke in syllables that sounded like wind through broken windows. [541] Erasmus answered in kind, confirming that tomorrow he would bring the clover pods, then the thistle, following the rotation the birds had helped him understand. [565] Their calls mapped the subsurface currents, the temperature gradients, the precise conditions each seed required. [580]

The flowers on the jetty glowed brighter as true darkness fell. [591] Somewhere beneath the waves, the dead reef continued its slow dissolution, feeding a resurrection it would never witness. [608] Erasmus watched the seeds disappear into the luminous water, carrying forward a conversation between species that needed no translation—only patience, observation, and faith that gardens could heal what armies had broken. [640]

He would return tomorrow, and the day after, until the battlefield bloomed or he joined the reef in its generous decay. [662] The cormorant spread its wings and vanished into the narrow vastness, carrying news of seeds and tides to whatever listened beneath the darkening waves. [687] The coachman stood alone on the blooming jetty, fluent in languages of the dead, tending a garden that existed mostly in the future, held in submerged concord with a world still learning to speak.
