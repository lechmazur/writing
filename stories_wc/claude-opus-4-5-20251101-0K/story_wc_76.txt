The lighthouse keeper had been dead for seventeen years when Alaric rowed ashore, his toolbox rattling against the hunger stone he'd stolen from the dried riverbed in Dresden. [32]

Low tide exposed the island's skeleton—black rocks jutting like vertebrae, tide pools holding the last breath of retreating water. [50] The lighthouse itself spiraled wrong, its architecture defying expectation, stairs winding counter to every other tower Alaric had ever climbed. [67] But then, he'd spent his life making clocks that ran backward, so wrongness felt like home. [82]

He was a counter clockwise clock maker by trade and obsession, a man who believed time could be unwound like thread from a spool. [102] His workshop in Munich had produced timepieces that measured regret, that counted down to moments already passed. [118] Collectors called him neatly inventive. [123] His ex-wife called him insane. [128] Perhaps both were true. [132]

The hunger stone sat heavy in his satchel, its carved warning visible even through the canvas: "If you see me, weep." [152] Medieval villagers had placed such stones in rivers to mark drought and famine, monuments to suffering that appeared only when waters fell desperately low. [172] This one bore an additional inscription, nearly worn away: coordinates leading here, to this lighthouse that appeared on no modern map. [192]

Inside, seventeen years of dust coated everything except a single object on the lighthouse keeper's desk—an ancient yoyo, its wood dark with age, its string impossibly intact. [218] Alaric recognized the symbols carved into its surface. [227] They matched the hunger stone exactly. [233]

He understood then why he'd been drawn here, why every backward-spinning clock he'd built had pointed toward this moment. [250] The yoyo wasn't a toy. [255] It was a mechanism, a puzzle box disguised as something innocent. [265] And puzzles were meant to be solved. [272]

Through reverse-engineering, Alaric began to initiate his understanding of the device's true nature. [284] He disassembled it carefully, finding gears within gears, springs coiled in directions that made his backward-running clocks seem pedestrian. [303] Each component revealed more complexity, more intentional wrongness. [311] Whoever had built this had understood something fundamental about the direction of causality itself. [324]

Hours passed under the slow exhale of low tide, the ocean holding its breath as Alaric worked. [340] The hunger stone began to glow. [346]

Not brightly—nothing so dramatic. [351] Instead, it emanated what he could only describe as latent radiance, light that had always been present but never expressed, potential finally becoming kinetic. [373] The stone's warning took on new meaning: if you see me, weep—not from sorrow, but from the overwhelming beauty of hidden things revealed. [396]

Alaric's hands trembled as he reassembled the yoyo in reverse order, following the logic of its backward construction. [414] His motivation crystallized with each piece: to step beyond fate's design, to prove that destiny was just another mechanism that could be unwound. [435] He'd lost his daughter to an accident he'd arrived too late to prevent. [448] Every backward clock since then had been a prayer, a desperate hope that time could be convinced to reconsider. [466]

The completed yoyo felt different now—heavier, more present. [475] When he cast it downward, it didn't simply drop and return. [486] It fell through something, trailing light from the hunger stone like a fishing line cast into deeper waters. [502]

The lighthouse lens above him ignited spontaneously, sweeping its beam across rocks that no longer looked quite so skeletal. [520] Bleak exhilaration flooded through him—the specific joy of standing at the edge of the impossible, terrified and alive. [537]

He pulled the yoyo back, and it brought with it a sound: his daughter's laughter, distant but real, echoing from some fold in time he'd finally learned to access. [564]

The hunger stone's light intensified, and Alaric understood its true purpose. [575] It wasn't a warning about famine. [581] It was a key, waiting for waters to fall low enough—for circumstances to become desperate enough—for someone to finally use it. [600]

He cast the yoyo again, following the light, chasing the laughter toward a moment he'd spent seventeen years trying to reach. [620] The lighthouse spun its beam counter clockwise now, unwinding the night, and Alaric climbed the backward stairs toward whatever lay beyond fate's design. [644]

Outside, the tide began to return, slowly covering the hunger stone's resting place, hiding the path for whoever might come seeking next. [666] But Alaric was already gone, pulled through a door that only opened for those desperate enough to build backward, to think counter to everything the world insisted was true. [695]

The lighthouse stood empty again, waiting, its lens still spinning wrong against the brightening sky. [711]
