The lore keeper's boots left no prints on the crystalline path as she approached the waterfall that fractured light into impossible colors. [22] Meridia had spent forty years cataloging the old stories, and now, with only hours until sunrise, she would finally test the most persistent legend of all. [47]

Beyond the kaleidoscopic cascade lay the orchard where the first emperors had planted their succession trees, each fruit said to contain the memory of a rightful heir. [72] The throne had sat empty for three centuries, its holographic crown flickering in an empty chamber while bureaucratic councils squabbled over legitimacy. [91] But Meridia knew what the politicians had forgotten: legitimacy could still be claimed. [103]

She stepped through the waterfall, its prismatic spray coating her weathered cloak in droplets that gleamed like scattered data points. [121] The orchard sprawled before her, ancient trees heavy with luminescent fruit, their gnarled trunks wrapped in forgotten circuitry that had once monitored the health of dynasties. [144] This was the empire's heart, hidden and waiting. [153]

Meridia moved wisely through the rows, adventurous enough to seek what others feared but cautious enough to read the signs. [172] She had not survived six decades of upheaval by rushing toward destiny. [185] Her motivation was singular: somewhere in this orchard stood the stairway of ascension, the mythic path that would carry a worthy soul to the throne's chamber. [208]

The first mural revealed itself on the gardener's shed, paint peeling from its walls in sheets that curled like ancient scrolls. [229] Meridia's trained fingers worked carefully, lifting away centuries of camouflage to expose the pigments beneath. [244] An emperor's face emerged, his hand pointing toward the orchard's center where the trees grew thickest. [259]

She sallied forth, her pace quickening as the moons began their descent toward morning. [273] Each structure she passed yielded more secrets through the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals that formed a narrative map. [293] Here, a queen ascending stairs that spiraled into clouds. [303] There, a prince kneeling before a tree whose roots became steps. [315]

The ruby flake had been her grandmother's, a fragment of the throne's shattered seal passed down through generations of lore keepers. [335] Meridia drew it from her pocket now, watching it pulse with warmth as she neared the orchard's heart. [353] The old texts claimed such fragments resonated with the stairway's location, a failsafe the builders had installed for those patient enough to preserve them. [376]

The central tree was massive, its trunk wide as a council chamber, its bark etched with circuitry that still hummed with dormant power. [398] Paint covered one section completely, a later addition meant to hide what the desperate had sought to protect. [416] Meridia worked methodically, peeling back layer after layer until the final mural blazed forth in colors that had not faded despite three hundred years of concealment. [441]

The stairway of ascension was no physical structure. [450] The mural depicted the tree itself, its branches reaching upward through dimensional gates, each step a choice, each landing a test of worthiness. [471] Meridia pressed the ruby flake against the painted trunk, and the bark before her shimmered, becoming translucent, becoming a doorway. [491]

She thought of the unclaimed throne, of the empire fragmenting into corporate territories and algorithmic governance, of children who had never known what it meant to have someone chosen by more than market forces. [520] The old ways had been flawed, but they had held meaning. [532] Perhaps, she thought with the wisdom her adventures had granted her, new ways could hold both meaning and progress. [550]

Dawn approached. [552] The first rays would seal the passage for another century, the old texts had warned. [566] Meridia was sixty-four years old, a keeper of lore rather than a wielder of power, and she had never imagined herself a ruler. [589]

But someone had to climb. [594] Someone had to try. [598] Someone had to believe that the future could learn from what the past had hidden rather than simply forgotten. [616]

The lore keeper stepped through the shimmering bark and felt the first stair materialize beneath her feet. [632] Above her, the branches stretched into impossible distances, each one a path she might take, each one a future she might shape. [654] The ruby flake dissolved into light, becoming part of her, becoming proof of her right to ascend. [671]

She climbed as the sky brightened beyond the kaleidoscopic waterfall, leaving behind the hidden orchard but carrying its stories with her. [691] The throne awaited, unclaimed no longer. [697] And when she reached it, she would remember that she was still, first and always, a keeper of lore. [715] Some stories, she knew, were not meant to be preserved. [726] They were meant to be continued. [732]
