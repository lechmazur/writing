The elevator shaft had been flooded for decades, but Mira descended anyway, her headlamp cutting through water that had turned the color of weak tea. [28]

She hated enclosed spaces. [32]

Every spelunker joke she'd ever heard mocked the irony, but they didn't understand. [45] The fear was precisely why she went into the dark places—because someone had to remember what was buried there, and terror kept her sharp. [68]

The forgotten research facility sprawled across the seafloor like a drowned cathedral, its observation domes still intact after forty years. [87] When the undersea cables connecting it to the mainland had been severed during the earthquake of 1983, the scientists inside had twelve hours of air. [111] Twelve hours between one tidal change and the next, and then nothing but silence on every frequency. [128]

Nobody came back for them. [133]

The world moved on to other projects, other facilities, other priorities. [144] The cable network was rerouted, and Station Epsilon became a footnote redacted from official records. [158]

Mira found the first body in the communications room, still seated at the console where she'd died trying to restore the severed line. [180] The nameplate read Dr. Helena Voss. [186] Mira photographed it, logged the coordinates, and moved deeper. [196]

Her equipment was specialized—sensors that tracked invisible things, the electromagnetic ghosts of old transmissions still echoing through corroded copper. [214] The undersea cables had carried more than data; they'd carried voices, last words, pleas that rippled outward and faded into static. [234] She followed those traces now, mapping the final hours of people who deserved witnesses. [248]

In the archives, she found the codex. [255]

It shouldn't have survived the flooding, but someone had sealed it in a pressurized case, their last act of preservation before the water came. [278] Mira cracked the seal carefully, her gloves trembling against the membrane. [289] Inside, pages of handwritten notes documented experiments in phase transitions—matter shifting between states, solid to liquid to gas and back again. [308]

The margin illumination caught her light. [314] Gold flecks, painstakingly applied, decorated the borders of each page with images of waves and transformation. [329] Someone had made this beautiful in the middle of groundbreaking science, had cared enough to gild their work like medieval monks. [349]

The name inside the cover was Dr. Samuel Chen. [358]

She found him in the laboratory, preserved by the cold and the pressure, his hands still wrapped around a photograph of a child she would never identify. [382] The crashing hush of the deep pressed against her suit, that particular silence that wasn't silence at all but the weight of an ocean holding its breath. [408]

Mira's chest tightened. [411] The walls were close here, closer than she liked, the ceiling low and barnacled. [425] She forced herself to breathe, to stay, to document. [434]

This was why she came. [439]

Not for discovery or glory or the academic papers she'd publish. [450] She came to stand witness for the unremembered, to say their names aloud in the dark and prove that someone, finally, had returned. [471]

"Dr. Samuel Chen," she said into her recorder, her voice strange in the flooded chamber. [485] "Researcher. Artist. Father, probably. I see you." [493]

The tidal window was narrowing. [498] She had perhaps two hours before the currents shifted and the facility became inaccessible again, swallowed by the same forces that had claimed it originally. [521] Water moved through phase transitions of its own down here—not temperature but pressure, the way it behaved differently at crushing depths. [540]

She photographed each body. [544] Seven scientists in total, scattered through the station in poses of work and waiting and hope. [559] Seven names for her records, seven people who had trusted that the world would remember them. [574]

The return journey was harder than the descent. [582] Mira's muscles burned as she ascended through the flooded shaft, the codex secured in her sample bag. [598] Above her, the surface waited with its sunlight and its short memories. [611]

But she would not forget. [616]

She emerged between tidal changes, gasping, and the codex's gold flecks caught the dying light like small preserved stars. [633] The undersea cables nearby hummed with new data flowing to new destinations, the world perpetually moving forward. [650]

Mira sat on the research vessel's deck, water streaming from her suit, and began to write the names. [667]

Helena Voss. [669]

Samuel Chen. [671]

Five others, waiting their turn. [676]

The ocean crashed its endless hush against the hull, and she kept writing until every last scientist was remembered, their stories surfacing from the deep where they'd been buried too long. [704]

This was her gift and her curse—tracking the invisible, following the fading signals, descending into spaces that made her want to scream. [725]

But someone had to go into the dark places. [734]

Someone had to bring the forgotten home. [741]
