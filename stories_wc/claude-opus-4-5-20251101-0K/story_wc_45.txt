The hedge maze had grown wild in the seventeen years since Eleanor last walked its paths, yet her feet remembered every turn. [24] She emerged into the secret garden at twilight, where her sister's grave marker stood beneath the apple tree, unchanged except for the moss claiming its edges. [50]

After the substitute body was found, they had buried it here with full honors. [64] Eleanor had been eleven then, old enough to be a forgiving skeptic when her mother whispered that the real Charlotte had been taken by the fair folk, replaced by something that died in its crib. [95] She had nodded and said nothing, though doubt lived in her bones like an ache that never quite healed. [113]

Now she was a doctor, trained in the practical art of bone setting and the clinical certainty of anatomy. [130] She had mended fractures in mining towns, aligned joints in charity wards, and learned that bodies were simply puzzles of calcium and cartilage. [152] Yet here she stood, holding the small wooden box her mother had pressed into her hands on her deathbed. [170]

Inside lay a single tooth, impossibly small, still bearing the faint opalescent sheen that marked it as belonging to no human child. [192] A changeling's baby tooth, her mother had called it, the only proof that Charlotte had been real and had been stolen. [214]

Eleanor turned it over in her palm, feeling the cleft in certainty that had defined her life crack wider. [232] She had built her career on evidence, on the tangible truth of flesh and bone. [247] But evidence lay in her hand now, glowing faintly in the gathering dark, and she could not explain it away. [268]

The garden smelled of night-blooming jasmine and something older, sweeter, like honey left too long in the sun. [286] Eleanor knelt beside the grave and began to dig with her bare hands, shrewdly innocent in her trespass, knowing that sometimes answers required desecration. [310]

The bones she unearthed were wrong. [316] Too light, too curved, as if they had belonged to something that flew rather than walked. [332] She held a femur up to the moonlight and saw it was hollow, delicate as a bird's wing. [350]

All those years of yearning to understand, and understanding had been waiting here beneath her feet. [366]

She thought of her mother, who had spent decades being called mad for insisting on the truth. [382] She thought of Charlotte, wherever she truly was, perhaps still alive in some realm beyond the hedge maze. [399] And she thought of herself, the skeptic who had needed proof while secretly hoping to be proven wrong. [416]

A wind stirred the apple blossoms, and Eleanor made her decision. [427]

She would not rebury these bones. [433] She would study them, document them, find others who had lost children to cribs that held the wrong bodies. [452] She would turn her mother's grief into scholarship, her own doubt into discovery. [465] The mistakes of dismissal, the cruelty of calling truth madness, these she would transform into constellations of evidence that others could navigate by. [487]

It was nostalgic work, this excavation of old pain, but innovation lived in its heart. [502] Science could expand to hold mystery without breaking. [511] She had spent her career setting broken bones; now she would set broken beliefs, realigning the world's understanding until it could accommodate what she held in her hands. [540]

Eleanor placed the changeling's tooth back in its box, alongside a fragment of the impossible skeleton. [555] Tomorrow she would return to the city, to her practice, to the carefully ordered life she had built as a fortress against wonder. [578] But she would carry this garden with her now, this secret space where certainty ended and something stranger began. [596]

The moon rose higher, and somewhere beyond the hedge maze, a child laughed with a voice like silver bells. [614] Eleanor smiled, forgiving herself at last for all the years she had refused to listen. [630]

Her mother had been right. [635] The fair folk were real, and Charlotte was still out there, and the world was far more vast and terrible and beautiful than any anatomy textbook could contain. [661]

She would find her sister, or she would spend her life trying. [673] Either way, she would make meaning from loss, turn sorrow into stars. [685]

The hedge maze closed behind her as she left, but Eleanor knew the path now. [700] She would always know the path back to the place where skepticism learned to kneel before wonder, and wonder learned to offer proof. [722]
