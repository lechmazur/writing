The lantern maker's hands never stopped moving, even when her heart begged for stillness. [14]

Mei worked in the floating island tea garden, where jasmine perfumed the air and grief hung heavier than the mists below. [33] Her workshop occupied the garden's eastern pavilion, surrounded by ancient oolong bushes that whispered secrets to anyone patient enough to listen. [52] Through her window, she could see the glass basilica on a floating isle—a cathedral of crystalline spires that captured starlight and refracted it into dreams. [74]

The basilica was where dream recording happened, where the wealthy paid fortunes to preserve their happiest memories in gemstone spheres. [93] But Mei had discovered another use for the technology, one that required her particular craft. [107]

She folded another crane, her thousandth this month, each one infused with a fragment of her daughter's laughter. [123] Lin had fallen from the garden's edge three seasons ago, and Mei had been folding grief into origami cranes ever since, trying to transform unbearable weight into something that could fly. [152]

The cranes lined her shelves, paper wings catching lamplight, each one a vessel for sorrow she couldn't carry in her chest. [173]

But paper wasn't enough anymore. [178]

Tonight marked the anniversary—the timeframe after the shadow detaches, when the soul's silhouette finally separated from the body it once inhabited. [198] The monks said Lin's spirit would complete its journey at midnight. [209] Mei intended to intercept it. [214]

She pulled out her gem polishing kit, the same tools she used to craft the lenses for her famous lanterns. [232] The basilica's dream recorders used similar technology, refracting consciousness into crystal matrices. [244] Mei had spent months studying their methods, trading lanterns for secrets, being crafty where others were merely clever. [261]

Her masterwork sat on the workbench: a lantern unlike any she'd made before. [274] Its frame held seventeen polished gems, each one ground to specifications she'd calculated through sleepless nights and mathematical desperation. [292] The central lens was cut from the same crystal the basilica used, smuggled out piece by piece in tea shipments. [312]

The lantern would capture Lin's departing shadow, recording her essence before it dissolved into the cosmic winds. [328]

Mei climbed to the garden's highest terrace as midnight approached. [338] The sensation was strange—she descended while ascending, her spirit sinking into memory even as her body climbed the stone steps. [358] Each stair brought her closer to the sky and further from the woman she'd been before loss hollowed her out. [378]

The glass basilica pulsed with accumulated dreams, its spires catching moonlight. [389] Mei raised her lantern. [393]

The shadow came at the stroke of twelve—Lin's silhouette, wavering like heat above summer stones. [408] It wore her daughter's shape, carried her daughter's essence, and Mei's hands trembled as she activated the lantern's mechanism. [427]

Light blazed through seventeen gems, each one polished to capture a different frequency of spirit. [442] The shadow scattered into prismatic fragments, then reassembled inside the central crystal. [454]

Mei fell to her knees, clutching the lantern. [462]

Inside the lens, Lin's shadow moved—not trapped, but transformed. [472] The recording hadn't just captured her daughter's departing spirit; it had given that spirit a new vessel, a home of light instead of flesh. [495]

The lantern glowed with luminous torment, beautiful and terrible. [504] Mei could see Lin's face in the refractions, could almost hear her voice in the crystal's resonance. [521]

"Mama," the shadow whispered, and Mei's grief cracked open like an egg, spilling not darkness but dawn. [539]

She understood now why she'd folded so many cranes. [548] Not to escape sorrow, but to practice transformation—to learn that nothing truly disappears, it only changes form. [565] Paper became birds became prayers became this moment, where death bent toward reunion. [578]

Mei hung the lantern from the pavilion's eave, where it would shine across the tea garden forever. [595] Lin's shadow danced inside, no longer departing but dwelling, a dream recorded in crystal and mother-love. [612]

The glass basilica dimmed slightly, as if acknowledging a rival. [622]

Mei folded one final crane from moonlit paper and released it into the wind. [636] It spiraled upward toward the lantern, and Lin's shadow reached out to catch it. [651]

The transformation was complete. [655]

Grief had become light, loss had become presence, and a crafty lantern maker had built a window between worlds using nothing but polished gems, stolen knowledge, and a love that refused to let go. [687]

The tea garden's jasmine bloomed brighter that night, as if the flowers themselves approved. [701]

And in her workshop, surrounded by a thousand paper cranes, Mei finally slept without nightmares, her daughter's light watching over her until dawn. [723]
