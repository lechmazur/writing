The sunken orchard greenhouse rose from the seabed like a cathedral of moss and fractured glass, its iron ribs threaded with kelp that swayed in currents no living sailor remembered. [31] Marina descended through the hatch each morning, her pressure suit humming against the cold, drawn by work that made sense to no one on the surface. [54] The shipwrecks encircling the structure had become part of its architecture now, their hulls fused with the greenhouse walls by decades of salt and silence. [76]

She was a hearing aid designer by trade, though her clients had long since stopped being ordinary. [91] The devices she crafted here were meant for the dead, or rather, for those who wanted to hear what the dead had left behind. [114] Marina herself heard colors faintly, a synesthetic gift that turned the aurora's green shimmer into a low hum and the rust-red of old anchors into something like whispered vowels. [140] This made her perfect for the work, though it had also made her lonely in ways she rarely examined. [158]

At the greenhouse's heart stood the ashen forge, a relic from a whaling ship that had carried it down when the vessel split against the reef sixty years ago. [184] The forge still functioned, heated now by geothermal vents rather than coal, and above it the aurora's light filtered through cracked glass panels in ribbons of singing green. [210] Marina spent her hours there, shaping tiny receivers from salvaged metals, each one calibrated to capture a specific frequency of absence. [230]

Her method was unconventional: she collected absences. [237] Where conversations had ended, where promises had broken, where trust had shattered between two people, there remained a hollow in the air that most instruments could not detect. [261] Marina's devices could. [264] She would place a receiver in the forge's pale heat, let the aurora's vibration imprint upon the metal while cells divide, while life continued its quiet multiplication in tide pools and in the bodies of those still breathing above. [301]

Her current project consumed her entirely. [307] She wanted to find the sound of trust breaking, that specific frequency of collapse when one person realizes another has failed them. [327] It was not revenge she sought, though her mother's face flickered sometimes in the green-lit water. [343] It was understanding. [346]

Her mother had designed hearing aids too, before the accident, before the trial, before she vanished into a facility where Marina was not permitted to visit. [370] The memories of their workshop surfaced unbidden: her mother's hands adjusting tiny components, the smell of solder, the aurora visible through their northern window. [393] Those memories had weight, had texture. [399] They pressed against Marina's chest like pressure from fathoms of water. [410]

The impact of memories, she had learned, was physical. [419] They left marks on the world, sonic fossils that persisted long after the moments themselves had drowned. [435] In the shipwrecks around her, she had collected dozens of such fossils: a captain's final order, a bride's seasick laughter, a child asking when they would reach shore. [462] Each absence told a story of presence now gone. [471]

Today she worked on her mother's frequency. [478] She had retrieved a fragment of glass from their old workshop, had carried it down through the hatch in a lead-lined case. [500] The glass still held the residue of their last conversation, when her mother had admitted the fraud, when Marina had felt something inside her chest crack along invisible fault lines. [528]

She placed the glass beside the forge. [535] The aurora sang through the greenhouse ceiling, and Marina listened for the color of that moment, the exact shade of broken green. [556] Her newest device warmed in her palm, its circuits ready to receive. [568]

The imprint came slowly, the way all true things do. [578] She heard it first as a color, the murky amber of disappointment, then as a sound, thin and high, like a wire snapping under tension. [601] Trust breaking. [603] It sounded nothing like she expected. [609] It sounded like her own voice, fourteen years old, saying I believe you just before the lie became visible. [627]

Marina held the device against her chest and wept into her helmet. [639] The shipwrecks creaked around her, their own absences singing in sympathy. [650] Above, the aurora continued its silent burning, green light filtering down through fathoms of loss. [664]

She would finish the device. [669] She would send it to her mother, wherever her mother had gone. [681] Perhaps it would help. [685] Perhaps her mother needed to hear that frequency too, needed to understand what had shattered between them. [700]

The forge cooled as Marina worked, her battered marvel of a workshop holding steady against the tide. [715] Some things, she thought, were worth descending for. [724] Some sounds were worth the pressure of all that water, all that memory, all that absence made finally, impossibly, audible. [743]
