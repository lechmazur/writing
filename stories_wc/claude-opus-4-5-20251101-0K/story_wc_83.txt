The floating observatory drifted through perpetual twilight, suspended above clouds that had long forgotten the earth beneath them. [21] Yara pressed her palm against the cold viewport, watching her breath fog the glass where stars should have been visible. [40] The circuit breakers had tripped again, overloaded by her latest calculations, and she had perhaps twenty minutes while they cooled before the systems would allow another attempt. [65]

She reached into her pocket and withdrew the geode crystal, its hollow interior catching what little light remained. [82] Her brother Tariq had given it to her three days before the wedding, before the sky had opened and delivered fire that took everyone but her. [105] The geode was intangibly tangible now, a physical object that somehow felt like holding smoke, like gripping a memory that kept slipping through her fingers. [129]

Seven years of survival had led her here, to this impossible station where astronomers once mapped distant worlds. [146] Now she used their abandoned equipment for a different purpose: to hunt for the places where unused potential pools, those reservoirs of possibility that the universe had somehow forgotten to spend. [176]

Through perturbation theory, she had developed a method to detect these anomalies. [188] Small disturbances in the cosmic background radiation revealed pockets where reality had neglected to collapse its wave functions. [204] Where futures that should have been observed remained suspended, unresolved. [214] If she could find enough of them, chart their locations, perhaps she could understand why some moments branched into death while others somehow sprouted survival. [238]

The console beeped. [241] Two more minutes until the breakers reset. [248]

Yara turned the geode over in her hands, studying the amethyst crystals clustered inside its dark shell. [264] Her therapist at the displacement camp had called her condition survivor's guilt. [275] But that was wrong. [279] What she felt was not guilt but incompleteness, the sensation of being half-awake in a world that demanded full consciousness. [296]

The attack had been an unfiltered awakening in the worst possible way. [308] One moment she had been adjusting her sister-in-law's veil, and the next she was lying in rubble, ears ringing, tasting copper and ash. [332] No buffer, no gradual realization. [338] Just the immediate, brutal knowledge that everyone she loved had become shadows burned into stone. [352]

Now she sought another awakening, one she could control. [361]

The observatory groaned as wind currents shifted its position. [370] Outside, the clouds below churned in patterns that resembled brain tissue, folds and valleys of gray matter contemplating nothing. [388] Yara found a bleak exhilaration in this isolation, this hunt conducted miles above a world that had proven itself capable of casual annihilation. [410]

The console chirped. [413] Breakers cooled. [415] Systems online. [417]

She loaded her latest data set and began the calculations again. [428] The perturbation equations scrolled across her screen, each variable representing a tiny deviation from expected reality. [444] Somewhere in the mathematics, she believed she would find the answer to why potential accumulated in certain places, why some possibilities remained forever unrealized while others exploded into being without warning or mercy. [478]

A spike appeared on the readout. [484]

Yara leaned forward, her heart accelerating. [490] The signature was unmistakable: a concentration of unresolved quantum states approximately three hundred kilometers northeast, hovering in the atmosphere like a held breath. [512]

She recorded the coordinates with trembling fingers. [519] This was the third such pocket she had located this month. [530] Together, they formed a pattern she was beginning to understand, a map of what the universe had chosen not to become. [551]

The geode caught the screen's glow and scattered it into fragments of purple light across the observatory walls. [568] Yara watched the play of illumination and thought about hollow things, about how beauty sometimes grew only in darkness, in the spaces where solid matter failed to form. [596]

She would continue the hunt tomorrow, and the day after, for as long as the station remained aloft. [614] Not for vengeance, not for closure. [620] But because somewhere in those pools of unused potential lay the blueprint for a different world, one where wedding dresses did not burn and children did not become statistics in reports filed by men who would never know their names. [661]

Finding that blueprint would not resurrect the dead. [669] But it might prove that their deaths had not been inevitable, that the universe contained alternatives to cruelty even if humanity had failed to choose them. [693]

The clouds below continued their slow rotation, and Yara returned to her equations, the geode warm now in her palm, no longer intangible but impossibly, unbearably real. [721]

In the silence of the floating observatory, suspended between stars and storms, she calculated her way toward an answer that might never come, sustained by nothing but bleak exhilaration and the stubborn conviction that unused potential was not the same as wasted hope. [771]
