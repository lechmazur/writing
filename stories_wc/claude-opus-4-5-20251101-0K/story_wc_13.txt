The canals ran between towers like silver threads stitched through the sky, and Miriam balanced on the narrow stone edge, her sketchbook pressed against her chest. [28] She had spent thirty years drawing the bones of extinct creatures, the spiraling shells of ancient mollusks, the feathered impressions of birds that would never sing again. [54] Now she sought something far older than fossils. [62]

The infinity symbol pendant hung heavy against her sternum, warm as if it held its own pulse. [77] Her grandmother had given it to her on the day she died, whispering that the symbol was not decoration but instruction. [97] "Time is a loop," the old woman had said, "and those who understand this can sculpt it like clay." [115]

Miriam had not believed her then. [121] She believed her now. [125]

Above the rooftop canal system, the giant Aldros slept across the horizon, his body forming the distant mountain range that cradled the city. [147] His naps lasted three days exactly, and during these periods, the world held its breath. [163] Sound traveled differently. [166] Light bent in ways that made her illustrator's eye ache with wonder. [178] And somewhere in the acoustic chambers between the towers, echoes were born rather than merely reflected. [193]

She needed to find that place. [199]

The method had come to her in a dream: borrowing time. [210] Not stealing it, which would leave holes in the fabric of moments, but borrowing against her own future, pulling hours forward like thread from a spool. [237] The pendant allowed this, heating against her skin each time she reached into tomorrow and drew seconds back into now. [257]

She had perhaps borrowed a month's worth already. [266] She tried not to think about what that meant for whatever waited at the end of her life. [284]

The canal water beside her moved upward in lazy spirals, defying gravity as it always did during Aldros's sleep. [302] Miriam followed the waterway between two obsidian towers, her boots finding purchase on stones worn smooth by centuries of similar travelers. [323] The pendant grew warmer. [327]

She heard it then: an interrupted cadence. [334]

A melody began somewhere ahead, climbing toward resolution, then stopped. [345] Not faded, not silenced—stopped, like a sentence without its final word. [358] The incompleteness pulled at something deep in her chest, a yearning she had never named until now. [375]

This was what she had been illustrating her entire life without knowing it. [388] Every extinct species, every fossilized wing, every shell of a creature swallowed by time—they were all interrupted cadences, songs that stopped before their ending. [413]

The space between towers opened into a courtyard suspended above the city, and at its center stood a cage made of crystallized sound. [437] Inside, echoes circled like trapped birds, their wings made of half-finished phrases and truncated notes. [454]

Miriam understood. [456]

Echoes were not born here. [461] They were imprisoned here, caught the moment they began, prevented from ever completing their journey. [476] That was why the world felt so hollow, so haunted by incompleteness. [488] Every sound that should have returned to its source had been stopped mid-flight. [501]

She touched the pendant, felt it burn. [508] Borrowing time again, she pulled hours from her distant future, sculpting the seconds around her like wet clay. [527] Time slowed, stretched, became malleable in her hands. [536]

With her borrowed moments, she reached toward the cage's bars. [547] They dissolved at her touch—not breaking but completing, becoming the silence they had always been meant to become. [565]

The echoes burst outward. [569]

Miriam watched them fly: the final notes of songs sung centuries ago, the last words of conversations left hanging, the completed calls of birds whose species existed now only in her illustrations. [599] They spiraled upward through the canal system, seeking their origins. [610]

Above the city, Aldros shifted in his sleep, and Miriam thought she saw him smile. [626]

She sat down on the courtyard's edge, suddenly exhausted. [636] The pendant had cooled. [640] She did not know how much time she had left now, how many tomorrows she had traded for this moment. [659]

But for the first time in thirty years, she heard an echo return to her: her grandmother's voice, finally completing its interrupted sentence. [680]

"—and you will know peace." [685]

Miriam opened her sketchbook and began to draw, not bones or shells or feathers, but the shape of a completed cadence, rising like breath toward home. [712]
