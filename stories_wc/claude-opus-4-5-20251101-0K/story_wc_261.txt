The tower stood silent as dawn bled across the horizon, and Mira pressed her palm against the frosted hourglass that had belonged to her mother. [27]

She had woken forty minutes ago, the anesthesia finally releasing its grip on her consciousness after the surgery that was supposed to fix her, supposed to remove whatever aberration in her temporal lobe had made her hear the whispers of growing things. [62]

It hadn't worked. [65]

The fern on the windowsill murmured to her now, its fronds catching the first light, speaking of thirst and the slow patience of roots. [85] She was still accidentally telepathic with plants, and the doctors would want to try again, would want to tunnel deeper into her brain until they carved out whatever miracle had taken residence there. [115]

But Mira had other plans this morning. [122]

She traced the coffee rings stained into the wooden desk where her mother had once sat, reading fortunes in the circular marks left by ceramic cups. [145] Three rings overlapped near the edge, and Mira studied them the way she'd been taught—the thickest one representing the past, the faintest one the future, the middle ring the present moment of decision. [179]

Her mother had been a closure seeker, traveling to families broken by loss, helping them find peace. [195] But closure, Mira had learned, was just another word for opening wounds carefully enough that they could finally drain. [212]

The fern whispered of someone approaching. [218]

"You're supposed to be resting," said Thomas from the doorway, his footsteps quiet on the stone floor. [235] Her brother looked exhausted, having kept vigil through her surgery in the medical wing below. [249]

"I need to find her," Mira said, not turning from the desk. [262] "Mother's last patient. The one she never finished helping." [272]

Thomas exhaled slowly. [275] "The surgery was supposed to make you normal, Mira. Not send you chasing ghosts." [289]

"The surgery failed." [292] She finally turned to face him, letting him see the truth in her eyes. [306] "I can still hear them. The ivy outside is worried about the frost. The moss on the north wall remembers when this tower was young." [330]

His expression shifted from concern to something like grief. [339] "Then they'll want to operate again." [346]

"Which is why I have to go now." [354] Mira lifted the frosted hourglass, watching sand that had stopped flowing years ago, frozen in its descent like a displaced miracle caught between one moment and the next. [381] Her mother had found it in the aftermath of a meteor strike, pulled from earth that had been touched by something beyond understanding. [401]

The sand had never moved since. [407]

"Mother believed that scars tell stories," Mira said softly. [416] "She spent her life learning to read them—the stories in wounds, the narratives written in damage. She could look at someone's healed flesh and know what had broken them." [444]

"And what killed her was trying to heal someone whose scars ran too deep," Thomas replied. [459]

"No." [460] Mira set the hourglass down and pointed to the coffee rings on the desk. [474] "I've been examining these for months. Mother left a message in them, Thomas. She knew she might not come back from that last visit. The rings tunnel backward through her final days—she mapped her entire journey." [508]

The fern's whispers grew urgent, speaking of vibrations in the earth, of roots sensing movement far below. [524]

"Something's still alive down there," Mira said, the plant's voice clear in her mind. [538] "In the caverns beneath the old monastery where she disappeared. The plants know. They've always known." [554]

Thomas stared at her, and in the hush of dawn—that meteor-strike silence before the world fully wakes—she watched him choose. [573]

"The doctors will come looking for you," he finally said. [583]

"Then help me tunnel out through the garden passage before they do." [595]

He crossed to her side, looking down at the coffee rings, seeing nothing but stains. [610] But he trusted her—trusted the wound she kept opening in herself by refusing to forget their mother, trusted that some damage was worth carrying. [633]

"The plants," he said carefully. [638] "Can they guide us?" [642]

Mira smiled, feeling the ivy outside curl with something like hope. [653] "They've been waiting to." [658]

She pocketed the frosted hourglass, its frozen sand a reminder that miracles don't always land where they're expected, that sometimes they take root in the wrong garden and bloom into something the world calls aberration. [694]

Together, they descended into the waking tower, following the whispered directions of moss and root, chasing closure through wounds that had never been allowed to heal. [720]

And in her palm, impossibly, the sand began to fall. [730]
