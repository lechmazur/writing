The sensory map maker pressed her palm against the rusted hull of a derelict shuttle, feeling the texture of forgotten journeys seep into her fingertips. [26] Mira had catalogued a thousand surfaces across a dozen dimensions, each one leaving its imprint on her specialized neural interface, but the abandoned spaceport repair bay held something different. [52] Here, in the skeletal remains of humanity's first interstellar ambitions, reality felt thin as membrane. [66]

She pulled the green glass shard from her pocket, watching it catch the faint luminescence of dying emergency lights. [82] Her mother had given it to her seventeen years ago, the night before disappearing through a rift that shouldn't have existed. [100] "Find where this came from," she had whispered, "and you'll understand why I had to go." [115]

The bay stretched around Mira like a cathedral to obsolescence—maintenance drones frozen mid-repair, tools scattered across workbenches, coffee cups still bearing lipstick stains from technicians who'd evacuated decades past. [142] In the murmur of half-remembered dreams, this place existed between moments, neither fully abandoned nor entirely forgotten. [158] The quantum stabilizers had failed here first, creating pockets where time folded and worlds bled together. [173]

Mira knelt and touched the floor, letting her sensory mapping gift translate the concrete into data. [188] Footsteps layered upon footsteps—workers, refugees, travelers like herself who'd learned to slip between dimensional seams. [202] And there, beneath it all, her mother's distinctive gait pattern, preserved in the substrate of space-time. [217]

The glass shard grew warm against her thigh. [225]

She'd spent years mastering the art of weaving between worlds, learning to feel the pressure points where realities overlapped. [241] Her ability manifested cyclically spontaneous—she couldn't control when the gift would surge, only recognize the signs and ride the current. [259] Tonight, the surge was building. [264]

The shard pulsed green, and Mira saw it: a thread of light connecting this universe to another, running directly through the massive magnetic coupling unit that dominated the bay's center. [292] In her home dimension, the unit sat dormant. [301] But parallel versions of this same space hummed with different histories—she could sense them stacked like pages in a book. [320]

She approached the coupling unit, mapping its surface with trembling fingers. [331] Her mother had touched this exact spot. [338] The sensory data confirmed it. [343]

The truth she sought had weight—Mira had felt it pressing against her consciousness for years, a gravitational pull from the withheld. [362] Her mother had known something about the rifts, about the glass shard's origin, about why certain people could slip between worlds while others remained anchored. [384]

The cyclical surge crested. [388]

Reality split along invisible fault lines, and Mira found herself standing in the same bay, now alive with activity. [405] Technicians moved around her like ghosts, unaware of her presence. [416] Through parallel universes, she'd learned to redirect her trajectory, nudging herself toward the moments she needed to witness. [433]

There—at the magnetic coupling unit—stood her mother, younger by two decades, arguing with a man in a military uniform. [451]

"You can't suppress this research," her mother hissed. [459] "People are dying because they're crossing without understanding the dimensional toxicity. The green resonance crystals filter it—" [475]

"The crystals reveal the rifts," the officer interrupted. [483] "If civilians learn they can move between worlds, containment becomes impossible." [494]

Her mother's hand went to her pocket—the same pocket where Mira now carried the shard. [508] "Then I'll prove it myself. I'll document every safe passage, and when I return—" [523]

"You won't return. The toxicity accumulates. Everyone who's tried to chart the pathways..." [536]

The surge faded, yanking Mira back to the silent, abandoned version of the bay. [550] But now she understood. [554]

Her mother hadn't abandoned her. [559] She'd been mapping safe routes through dimensions, knowing the exposure would eventually kill her, sacrificing herself so others might travel freely. [577] The green glass shard wasn't just a memento—it was a filter, protection against the invisible poison that accumulated with each crossing. [595]

Mira pressed the shard to her heart, finally feeling the weight of the withheld truth settle into her bones. [612] Her mother had given her the only protection she possessed, ensuring her daughter could continue the work. [628]

The sensory map maker stood in the cathedral of forgotten ambitions and began charting her next crossing, the first of many safe passages she would document. [652] The weight of truth, she realized, wasn't a burden. [662] It was an anchor, keeping her grounded even as she learned to fly between worlds. [676]

In the murmur of half-remembered dreams, her mother's voice whispered approval. [687] And Mira, at last, stepped forward into the rift—protected, purposeful, finally understanding the price of the gift she'd inherited. [705]
