The phoenix had risen three days ago, leaving the sky streaked with ash and amber, and the glassblower's courtyard still hummed with residual heat. [28]

Mira pressed her palm against the warm flagstones, feeling the pulse of something ancient beneath. [42] She had come here not to watch glass being shaped, but to find a man who traded in awakenings—the kind that couldn't be bought with coin. [67]

Her canvas bag held little of value to most: dried lavender, a chipped teacup, and a concertina reed tongue she'd salvaged from her grandmother's ruined instrument. [92] The thin brass strip had once given voice to songs she could no longer remember, and its weight in her pocket felt like carrying a small ghost. [117]

The courtyard sprawled before her, abandoned furnaces cooling in neat rows, their glass remnants catching light she could only partially perceive. [136] Mira was a colorblind painter, and the world had always been a study in muted tones and educated guesses. [154] Red and green collapsed into the same muddy territory; her sunsets were famously melancholic, though she'd intended them to be vibrant. [173]

But she had learned to see differently. [180] Texture, form, the weight of shadow—these became her vocabulary, and she found beauty in what others called imperfection. [197]

"You've brought an offering." [201]

The voice came from behind a trellis thick with climbing jasmine and moonflower. [214] Theo emerged, the glassblower's apprentice turned something stranger since the phoenix's passage. [226] His eyes held that unsettling light of someone who had witnessed resurrection and been changed by proximity. [241]

"I've brought a trade," Mira corrected, her tone innocently cunning—a skill she'd honed from years of negotiating with gallery owners who assumed a colorblind painter would be easy to cheat. [268] "You barter in awakenings. I need to see what I've been missing." [282]

Theo smiled, neither kind nor cruel. [288] "The phoenix's fire burned through me. Now I can kindle that same fire in others—but only in exchange for something that carries genuine loss." [310]

Mira withdrew the concertina reed tongue, letting it catch the strange post-phoenix light. [323] "My grandmother played until her hands failed. This is the only piece I saved before the flood took everything else." [342]

Theo examined it without touching it. [348] "Loss, yes. But what do you offer of yourself?" [358]

She had prepared for this. [363] From her bag, she produced small clay pots, each containing carefully arranged plants: rosemary for remembrance, rue for regret, and thorned roses pruned into spiraling shapes. [385] In the language she'd developed—communicating through plant arrangements when words failed her—this configuration spoke of sacrifice willingly made. [402]

Theo read the arrangement like others read letters. [410] "You're offering your familiar darkness in exchange for overwhelming light." [421] He looked up. [424] "You understand that seeing colors won't make your work better? It might destroy everything you've built." [440]

"I don't want better," Mira said. [447] "I want true. Even if true is ugly, even if it reveals that everything I've painted has been wrong—I need to awaken to the full world." [472]

Theo took the reed tongue, and it seemed to vibrate in his grasp, releasing a single mournful note. [490] "Kneel by the furnace," he said. [497]

She obeyed, pressing her knees to warm stone. [506] He placed the brass strip against her closed eyelids, and the metal grew hot—not burning, but alive with accumulated memory. [525]

When Mira opened her eyes, the world exploded. [533]

The jasmine was cream, not the pale grey she'd always known. [545] The cooling glass scattered across the courtyard blazed in cobalt and amber and impossible emerald. [560] Tears streamed down her face as she stared at her own hands, seeing the blue veins beneath her skin for the first time. [583]

"The imperfections remain," Theo said softly. [590] "Color doesn't erase them. You'll still see the cracks, the flaws, the places where beauty falters." [607]

Mira laughed, wiping her eyes. [612] "That's exactly what I wanted." [618] She could see now that the courtyard's glass shards weren't beautiful because they were whole—they were beautiful because they were broken, and each break created new angles for light to enter. [650]

She had traded a piece of grief for a new kind of sight, and the exchange felt holy. [668]

In her bag, the plant arrangement had wilted—the sacrifice complete. [679] But already, she was planning her next painting: a phoenix rising, rendered in colors she finally understood, with all its imperfect glory burning against an imperfect sky. [704]

She would paint the cracks in the flames. [713] She would paint the ash alongside the gold. [722]

That was the beauty she'd always sought, and now she could finally see it true. [738]
