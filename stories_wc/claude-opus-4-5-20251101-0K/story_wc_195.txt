The greenhouse had not seen true sunlight in seven years, yet the silver-leafed trees still bore fruit that glowed with an inner phosphorescence. [27] Sir Aldric moved between the rows of alchemical orchards, his armor dulled to the color of old pewter, each step deliberate and silent. [50] He had been withdrawn from the Order of the Dawn three winters past, not for failure but for the crime of doubt. [71] Now doubt was all he had, and he carried it like a second skin beneath his chainmail. [88]

The endless night pressed against the glass panes overhead, a darkness so complete it seemed to breathe. [104] Aldric understood this darkness was factually mystical, born when the conjunction of three dying stars had torn a permanent wound in the sky above this valley. [130] The alchemists who had tended these orchards were long gone, fled or transformed into something the common tongue had no words for. [152]

He found it beneath a tree whose branches dripped with luminous pomegranates: an abandoned marionette theater program, its pages yellowed and spotted with age. [175] The cover depicted a puppet queen whose painted eyes seemed to follow him as he knelt in the loamy soil. [195] He should have left it there among the fallen leaves and glowing rinds, but his fingers recognized the symbols printed along the margins. [218]

Forgotten patterns. [220] The same patterns his grandmother had traced on his palm when he was a boy, promising they would keep him safe. [241] The same patterns he had seen carved into the walls of the temple where he had sworn his first oath. [261]

Reality shifted. [263] It did so gently at first, like a sleeper turning beneath heavy blankets. [275] The greenhouse walls seemed to stretch, the distance between trees expanding into cathedral vastness. [288] Aldric felt the shivering bliss of recognition move through him, that particular joy threaded with terror that came when truth revealed itself unbidden. [310]

He began to unsnap the clasps of his armor, letting each piece fall to the earth with a muffled thud. [330] Breastplate, pauldrons, vambraces, all the weight he had carried since boyhood. [341] Beneath them, he wore only a thin linen shirt, and his skin prickled in the greenhouse's eternal twilight. [359]

The program's pages turned without wind, stopping on an illustration of tangled strings descending from darkness. [375] Beneath it, words he somehow knew how to read: To capture the shape of possibility, one must first release the shape of certainty. [398]

A murmured allegiance rose to his lips, words he had never spoken but had always known. [414] They were not the oaths of his order, those rigid promises of sword and duty. [429] These were older, softer, a pledge to the uncertain and the unformed. [442] He spoke them to the glowing trees, to the wounded sky, to the ghost of whatever puppeteer had once performed in this strange place. [465]

The patterns on the program began to lift from the page, golden threads spinning upward through the humid air. [483] They wove themselves through the branches above him, connecting tree to tree, fruit to fruit, creating a web that hummed with potential. [505]

Aldric understood now why he had been drawn here, why his withdrawal from the world had been not an ending but a preparation. [529] The shape of possibility was not something to be seized with armored fists. [543] It required empty hands, a surrendered heart, the willingness to become a vessel rather than a warrior. [560]

Reality shifted again, more violently now. [566] The greenhouse groaned, its glass panels rippling like water. [575] Through the transparent walls, Aldric glimpsed other worlds bleeding through, cities of light and forests of shadow, oceans that burned and deserts that sang. [597]

He raised his arms into the web of golden threads, feeling them wrap around his wrists where his vambraces had been. [617] Not binding but connecting. [621] Not controlling but channeling. [625]

The shivering bliss consumed him entirely as possibility took its shape through him. [638] He was the marionette and the puppeteer both, moved and moving, a knight no longer withdrawn but finally, fully present. [658]

Above the wounded sky, something began to heal. [666] The endless night grew a single star, small and trembling, newborn. [677] The alchemical trees lifted their branches toward it, their glowing fruit brightening in response. [690]

Sir Aldric laughed, a sound he had forgotten he could make, and the greenhouse rang with its echo through every shifting reality at once. [713]

The program's pages settled, blank now, waiting for a new story to be written. [728] And in the eternal night of the alchemical orchard, possibility had finally found its shape: a withdrawn knight transformed, dancing in shivering bliss among the silver leaves, forever becoming. [758]
