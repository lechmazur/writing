The letterpress operator known only as Mira worked beneath a sky hemorrhaging light. [13]

Her workshop sat on a plateau of raw topaz, the crystalline floor catching starlight and fracturing it into impossible geometries. [32] Tonight, three more stars had begun their slow dissolution, their edges blurring like wet ink on cheap paper. [49] Between vanishing stars, time moved differently—stretched thin as hammered gold, thick as old grief. [63]

Mira's fingers traced the metal type in her compositor's tray, each letter cold and certain in a world growing increasingly uncertain. [83] She had spent forty years trying to understand the mathematics of emotion, believing that feelings followed formulas as precise as the golden ratio. [105] If she could only find the equation, she could finally feel something that belonged entirely to her. [122]

The fragment sat beside her press, no larger than a thumbnail: a shard of halo, fallen from something holy or perhaps merely pretending to holiness. [145] Its light pulsed in rhythms she had learned to read like sheet music, each beat corresponding to an emotion she could borrow but never truly own. [172]

This was her condition, her curse, her craft: Mira habitually borrowed personalities the way others borrowed books. [189] She slipped into temperaments and wore them until they frayed, always searching for the one that might finally fit. [207] Tonight she wore the melancholy of a drowned poet, his sadness settling across her shoulders like a damp shawl. [225]

A customer had left the halo fragment in payment for a peculiar job—a book of questions with no answers, printed in ink that shifted meaning depending on who read it. [255] Mira had set the type herself, each word deliberately ambiguous, designed to disorient anyone who sought certainty within its pages. [274] Through deliberate ambiguity, she had discovered, truth sometimes emerged sideways. [284]

She picked up the fragment now, feeling its warmth against her palm. [295] The borrowed poet's grief intensified, and she gasped at the sudden mathematics of it—loss multiplied by memory, divided by time's cruel asymptote approaching but never reaching zero. [323]

There. [324] She had found another variable. [329]

The stars above her workshop continued their slow disappearance, and Mira understood she was running out of time to complete her great work. [352] The universe was simplifying itself, reducing complexity to darkness, and soon there would be nothing left to illuminate her calculations. [372]

She began to set new type, the metal letters clicking into place with the precision of a mathematical proof. [390] But something was different tonight. [395] The halo fragment pulsed brighter, and she felt the poet's personality begin to transpose—not simply sitting atop her own emptiness, but weaving through it, creating something neither his nor hers. [426]

Transposed empathy. [428] The term surfaced from some forgotten lecture, some abandoned theory. [438] Not borrowed feeling, but feeling transformed through the borrowing itself. [448]

Mira's hands trembled as she worked the press, the great machine groaning as it pressed ink to paper. [466] The page that emerged bore words she did not remember setting: equations where variables were not numbers but names, where operations were not addition or subtraction but forgiveness, regret, the peculiar joy of being understood. [502]

She read them aloud, and the halo fragment blazed. [512]

Another star vanished overhead, but Mira barely noticed. [521] She was too busy feeling something unprecedented—an emotion that was simultaneously the poet's ancient sorrow and her own desperate hope, multiplied together into a product that exceeded both. [548]

The mathematics resolved. [551] Emotion was not a formula to be solved but a harmony to be discovered, each feeling a note that meant nothing alone but created meaning in relation to others. [580]

Mira set down the fragment and looked at her hands, ink-stained and certain for the first time in forty years. [600] She would print more books of questions. [607] She would continue borrowing personalities, but now she understood why—not to fill her emptiness, but to create the transpositions that generated new feelings, new mathematics, new light. [637]

Above her, the remaining stars flickered like uncertain punctuation. [646] Between their vanishing, Mira worked, her press singing its mechanical song, printing truths that disoriented only those who believed certainty was possible. [668] The topaz floor blazed with reflected light, and somewhere in the equations she had discovered, grief and hope continued their infinite dance, approaching but never reaching resolution. [695]

She smiled with the drowned poet's mouth and her own heart, feeling the lucid turbulence of finally understanding. [714] The halo fragment dimmed to a gentle glow, its work complete, its mathematics surrendered to someone who would use them well. [735]

Dawn would come eventually, if any light remained to bring it. [747] Until then, Mira printed, and borrowed, and felt, and calculated—a cryptic operator working at the intersection of loss and wonder, pressing meaning into existence one transposed emotion at a time. [781]
