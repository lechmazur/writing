The static shock changed everything. [5]

Maya pressed her fingertips together, watching the residual charge dance between them in the darkened studio, and for the first time in three weeks, she could feel the telepathy pill working again. [36]

Not working the way it had before, when the pharmaceutical company's little miracle had connected her to every stray thought within fifty meters. [55]

This was different. [58]

Fractally precise. [60]

She picked up her light-painting wand, the fiber-optic tip glowing amber, and began to trace patterns in the air while her camera's long exposure captured each movement. [88]

The streaks of light branched and rebranched, each spiral containing smaller spirals, each curve holding infinite curves within it. [106]

Her body remembered what her mind could not quite grasp. [116]

That was how the recall worked now, ever since the static shock from her studio's faulty ground wire had somehow rewired the drug's effects. [139]

Through somatic markers. [142]

When her shoulder tingled, someone nearby felt grief. [150]

When her left hand trembled, joy. [156]

When her stomach dropped, she knew without knowing that a secret was being kept. [170]

She hadn't believed in any of it at first. [179]

Maya Chen was an affectionate skeptic by nature, the kind of woman who would kiss her grandmother's lucky coin before politely explaining that correlation did not imply causation. [204]

But the body didn't lie the way the mind could. [214]

And now, after three weeks of learning to read these physical whispers, she was beginning to devise a method to use them. [236]

The pharmaceutical company wanted their pills back. [243]

The recall notice had arrived two days after the shock, citing "unexpected interactions with electromagnetic fields." [258]

Maya had flushed most of hers down the toilet, but she'd kept the last one, along with the muscovite geode sliver her brother Daniel had given her before he disappeared. [289]

The sliver sat on her workbench now, catching the amber light from her wand, its layered mica sheets glittering like frozen thought. [311]

Daniel had been on the same telepathy trial. [319]

Daniel had stopped answering his phone. [325]

Daniel had left behind only the geode and a single cryptic text: "Follow the pathways they don't want you to see." [345]

Her motivation had crystallized around those words. [352]

To illuminate hidden pathways. [356]

She swept the light wand in another arc, and her right knee buckled slightly, a somatic marker she'd come to recognize as proximity to someone with knowledge deliberately concealed. [386]

The studio door was closed. [391]

The windows were dark. [395]

She was alone, and yet her body insisted she was not. [406]

Maya set down the wand and picked up the muscovite sliver, holding it between her thumb and forefinger. [424]

The mica's crystalline structure had always reminded her of Daniel's mind, layer upon layer of brilliant complexity that most people never bothered to peel back. [449]

The tingling started in her palm. [455]

Not grief, not joy. [459]

Recognition. [460]

She closed her eyes and let the somatic markers guide her, moving through the darkened studio like a sleepwalker, her body responding to stimuli her conscious mind couldn't process. [488]

Her hand reached out and touched the wall behind her largest light panel. [501]

Cold. [502]

Her fingers found the seam Daniel had hidden there, the one she'd never noticed in three years of sharing this space. [521]

Behind the panel lay a small chamber, no bigger than a shoebox, containing a journal and seventeen more muscovite slivers arranged in a pattern that made her heart ache with recognition. [551]

Daniel's handwriting filled the pages. [556]

He'd devised the same method she had, months before the recall, before his disappearance. [570]

He'd mapped the pathways through his own body's responses, traced them like light paintings in the air, and discovered what the pharmaceutical company was really selling. [595]

Not telepathy. [597]

Control. [598]

And he'd found a way out. [604]

Maya's hands trembled as she read, but this time the trembling was her own, pure and unmediated, the hope rising in her chest as fragile and luminous as light through willowglass. [635]

Her brother was alive. [639]

He'd left her breadcrumbs written in mica and memory, trusting that she would learn to read them. [655]

Trusting that the same affectionate skepticism that made her question everything would also make her believe when belief finally became the only logical choice. [677]

She gathered the slivers carefully, pressing each one between the journal's pages. [690]

Tomorrow she would begin following the pathways Daniel had mapped. [700]

Tonight, she picked up her light wand one last time and painted his name in the darkness, watching the long exposure capture each letter in threads of golden fire. [730]

A message, a promise, a prayer. [736]

I'm coming to find you. [741]

The static charge still danced in her fingertips, and for the first time in weeks, Maya smiled. [758]
