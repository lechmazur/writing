The rain-beaded skylight loft had become Vera's sanctuary after the cryptocurrency crashes, when the old galleries emptied and she could afford the rent on a fortune-teller's meager income. [32]

She sat cross-legged on the worn Persian rug, her onyx-ink cartomancer's deck spread before her in a pattern she had invented herself—not for divination, but for something far more precise. [60] The cards were black as wet stone, their illustrations rendered in ink so dark it seemed to absorb the gray afternoon light filtering through the water-spotted glass above. [86]

Vera pulled the measuring tape from her pocket, the same one her grandmother had used to size fabric in the old country, and stretched it across the spread. [113] She noted the distance between the Hanged Man and the Tower, between the Empress and the reversed Five of Pentacles, recording each measurement in her leather journal. [139]

This was her true work: reverse engineering the cultural patterns hidden in how people chose their cards. [154]

For three years, she had tracked every reading, every hesitation, every instinctive reach toward one image over another. [170] The cryptocurrency collapse had given her the perfect dataset—hundreds of desperate clients seeking answers about vanished fortunes, each one unconsciously revealing the myths they lived by. [193] She was steadily curious about what would emerge, patient as the rain that had been falling for six days straight. [212]

A knock at the loft's iron door broke her concentration. [222]

Marcus Chen stood in the doorway, his designer coat soaked through, looking nothing like the venture capitalist who had once dismissed her practice as "theatrical nonsense" at a dinner party two years ago. [252] Now his face carried the hollow expression she had seen on dozens of clients since the digital money turned to digital ash. [273]

"I didn't know where else to go," he said. [282]

Vera gestured to the cushion across from her. [290] "Sit." [291]

She watched him settle, watched his eyes dart to the cards, watched his hands tremble almost imperceptibly. [307] This was data too—the body's confession before the mouth spoke a word. [320]

"I don't actually believe in this," Marcus said. [328]

"I know." [330] Vera began gathering the cards. [335] "But you came anyway. [339] That's what interests me." [343]

She shuffled the onyx deck with practiced hands, the cards whispering against each other like secrets. [358] "Choose nine," she instructed. [362]

He reached for the Wheel of Fortune first—they always did, these fallen financiers, drawn to the image of change, of cycles, of the hope that what goes down must come up. [392] She measured the position of his choice, added it to her mental catalog. [405]

As she laid out his reading, she began to confide in him—not about his future, but about her project. [423] "Every card you choose tells me something about the stories your culture planted in you," she said, tapping the Emperor he had selected third. [446] "Authority, control, the father figure who promises stability. [455] Eighty-three percent of male clients from your demographic choose this card in their top five." [468]

Marcus frowned. [470] "You're analyzing us?" [474]

"I'm mapping you," she corrected. [479] "By multiplying paths—tracking every possible choice against every actual choice—I can see the invisible architecture of belief." [495] She pulled out her journal, showed him the diagrams: branching trees of decisions, probability maps, cultural fault lines rendered in her grandmother's measuring tape measurements. [518]

"The crash didn't just destroy wealth," she continued. [527] "It revealed which myths people cling to when their constructed realities collapse. [538] Some reach for fate, some for judgment, some for rebirth." [548] She pointed to his spread. [553] "You reached for the Wheel, the Emperor, and the Magician. [563] Control, control, control. [567] Even now, you believe you can will your way back." [577]

The rain intensified overhead, drumming against the skylight like impatient fingers. [588] Marcus stared at his cards, and Vera recognized the moment—the crack in the armor she had seen so many times. [607]

"What does someone reach for when they've truly given up control?" he asked quietly. [621]

Vera smiled, shuffling the deck again. [627] "That's exactly what I'm trying to find out." [636]

She had inherited this mystery from her grandmother, who had read cards in another country after another crash, who had known that divination was never about predicting the future. [664] It was about revealing the present—the stories people carried like stones in their pockets, weighing them down or holding them steady. [685]

Marcus reached for another card without being asked. [694] The Moon: intuition, illusion, the unconscious path. [702]

Vera measured its position from the others and wrote the number down. [715] Another data point in her growing map, another thread in the pattern she was slowly, steadily, curiously unraveling—the hidden architecture of what people believed when everything else fell away. [746]

Outside, the rain kept falling, and inside, the onyx cards whispered their secrets to anyone patient enough to listen. [766]
