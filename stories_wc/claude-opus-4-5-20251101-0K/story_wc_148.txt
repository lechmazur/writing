The boy who cried wolf had a son, and that son learned early that no one believes the children of liars. [23]

Milo inherited his father's reputation like a birthstone no one wanted to wear. [35] Now seventeen, he stood in the lighthouse prison off the jagged reef, where the state sent those who sustained impossibilities—criminals whose confessions defied natural law, whose testimonies bent reality until the courts simply locked them away and forgot. [70]

The copperlight of dusk filtered through salt-crusted windows, casting everything in amber stillness. [83] Milo had come before they find the bodies, before the mainland patrol would arrive at dawn and discover what the warden had been doing to inmates who spoke too much truth. [111]

He needed to thread a labyrinth with his own story—to finally be believed. [124]

His father had died here, in cell fourteen, still insisting he'd seen wolves that last time. [140] The court records called it delusion. [147] The guards called it justice. [153] But Milo had found letters hidden in the old farmhouse, letters describing something hunting the peninsula's edge, something that wore silence like skin. [175]

Chasing hush, his father had written. [181] They're chasing hush, and when they catch it, no one will hear the screaming. [196]

The narrow door to the abandoned confessional stood ajar, as it had for decades, its frame scarred with scuffs from prisoners dragged through against their will. [223] Milo pressed his palm against those marks—stories worn into wood, prayers scraped into silence. [238] Through the scuffs on a narrow door left ajar for decades, he slipped inside. [252]

The confessional had been converted from a lighthouse storage room when the building became a prison, a place where inmates could unburden themselves to a priest who visited monthly. [280] Now dust claimed the velvet kneeler, and something else claimed the corner. [293]

A lattice from the confessional screen lay propped against the wall, torn free by desperate hands. [309] Through its diamond-shaped openings, Milo could see scratches in the stone—tally marks, yes, but also words. [327] Names. [328] Dates. [329] His father's handwriting. [332]

She comes when belief dies, the scratches read. [340] She feeds on the space between cry and answer. [350]

Milo's breath caught. [353]

A sound rose then—or rather, an absence of sound so profound it pressed against his eardrums. [370] The copperlight seemed to thicken, honey-slow, as something began to hover in the doorway behind him. [387]

He turned. [389]

She sustained impossibilities: a woman-shaped void where light bent wrong, where his shouts would go to die. [407] The hush given form. [411] She had fed on his father's final cries, on every prisoner's ignored pleas, growing fat on disbelief. [428]

"You're real," Milo whispered. [432]

The void tilted, curious. [436] No one had stated that so plainly in years. [446]

"My father saw you." [450] Milo gripped the lattice, its wooden diamonds biting his palms. [461] "He tried to warn everyone. [466] They called him a liar because of what his father did, what I'm still paying for." [482]

The hush-thing drifted closer, and Milo felt words evaporating from his tongue. [494]

But he had come prepared to be disbelieved. [503] He had threaded his own story through the labyrinth of his family's shame, and he understood now what his father never had—the wolf was never the point. [532] The point was that truth needs a witness who chooses to listen. [545]

He held up the lattice, that broken confessional screen, and spoke through it: "I see you. [561] I name you. [564] I believe in what my father saw." [572]

The words passed through those diamond openings and struck something in the creature's hollow center. [587] She flickered, destabilized by recognition, by the impossible gift of being acknowledged. [599]

For beings that feed on silence, nothing burns like being heard. [611]

The hush-thing shattered into a sound like breaking waves, and dawn light flooded the confessional. [627] Milo stood trembling, the lattice cracked in his hands, as somewhere below the prison stirred awake. [644]

They would find the bodies soon—the warden's victims, the silenced witnesses. [656] They would find Milo too, holding evidence of the impossible, ready to cry wolf one more time. [673]

But this time, he thought, letting the copperlight settle around him like absolution, this time he had proof. [690] This time he had his father's words and his own witness. [702]

This time, someone would listen. [707]

The patrol boat's horn sounded across the reef, and Milo walked toward the narrow door, toward the story he'd finally made his own. [731]
