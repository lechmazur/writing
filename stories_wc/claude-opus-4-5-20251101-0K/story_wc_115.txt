The tunnel mouth gaped like a confession waiting to spill, and Marcus stepped inside with his flashlight cutting weak arcs through the dust-thick air. [27]

He had spent three years exploring abandoned mills across the rust belt, crawling through collapsing floors and breathing asbestos like it was mountain air, but this was different. [52] The train tunnel connected to the old Harmon textile factory, and somewhere in its depths, his sister had disappeared seventeen years ago. [70]

Marcus was religiously skeptical, the kind of man who dismissed miracles while hunting ghosts of a more personal variety. [86] He didn't believe in spirits or divine intervention, but he believed in the weight of swallowed truths, the kind that lodged in your chest until you excavated them or died trying. [113]

His boots crunched on gravel as he moved deeper, past rusted track switches and the skeletal remains of maintenance carts. [130] The air held that peculiar drowsy alertness of three in the morning, when the world hung suspended between sleep and waking. [150]

In his earbuds, he listened to recordings he'd compiled over six months, frantic calls to talk-radio psychics that mentioned the Harmon factory. [169] A woman named Clara had called in repeatedly during 1987, the year Daniela vanished, speaking in coded panic about a ghost shift. [188]

"They're working them at night," Clara had said, her voice crackling through decades of audio decay. [202] "The girls nobody claims, nobody counts. The factory ghost shift." [212]

Marcus had learned to interpret these calls like scripture, parsing the desperation for geographical details, names, anything that pointed toward truth. [230] Clara mentioned a valve room, a wheel covered in beads from a broken necklace, a tunnel where the uncounted girls came and went. [251]

He found the junction where the tunnel met the factory's underground loading dock. [263] His flashlight caught something on the wall, a faded sign reading VALVE CONTROL, and his heart stuttered. [278]

The room was small, dominated by pipes that snaked toward the ceiling like frozen serpents. [292] And there, mounted on the central pipe, sat a valve wheel strung with glass beads, dozens of them threaded onto the rusted spokes. [313]

Marcus approached slowly, understanding settling into his bones with terrible weight. [324] Each bead was different, colors faded but still distinguishable: blue, amber, green, red. [336] He began to appraise them with trembling fingers, counting thirty-seven in total. [348]

Thirty-seven girls on the ghost shift. [354]

Daniela had worn an amber necklace the day she disappeared, a cheap thing from a carnival booth that she'd loved anyway. [373]

He found the amber bead near the top of the wheel, scratched but whole. [387]

The tunnel seemed to hold its breath around him, that hush that follows a sudden confession when the speaker waits to see if they'll be believed. [411] Marcus stood in that silence, finally understanding what Clara had tried to tell the world through late-night radio frequencies that nobody took seriously. [432]

The factory had run illegal shifts during the recession, hiring girls from group homes and foster care, girls whose disappearances would generate police reports that went nowhere. [456] The valve room had been their memorial, each bead placed by someone who witnessed and couldn't speak plainly. [472]

Marcus photographed everything, his movements mechanical now, the reckless explorer in him finally slowing to something more careful. [489] The truth he'd swallowed at fifteen, when everyone said Daniela had simply run away, was finally dissolving. [506]

She hadn't run. [509]

She'd been erased, and then commemorated in secret by someone with no other power to mark her passing. [526]

He sat down against the damp wall, exhaustion and revelation pressing equally on his shoulders. [541] The drowsy alertness sharpened into something clearer, a focus that came from finally reaching the end of a seventeen-year tunnel. [560]

In his earbuds, Clara's voice continued its desperate loop: "Someone needs to find them, someone needs to count them properly." [578]

Marcus counted. [580]

He counted thirty-seven beads and imagined thirty-seven girls walking into this tunnel in darkness, working shifts that officially never existed, and he understood that finding this truth was only the beginning. [608]

The weight of it settled into his chest where the swallowed silence had lived for so long, heavier but somehow easier to carry. [631]

He would make them count. [636]

He would drag the ghost shift into daylight where skeptics like himself would have to reckon with evidence instead of faith. [655]

The amber bead caught his flashlight one more time as he rose, and Marcus touched it gently before turning back toward the tunnel mouth and the world waiting to hear what he'd found. [686]

Daniela had been here. [690]

Now she could finally leave. [695]
