The cobalt glade held its breath at dusk, that impossible hour when the sky turned the color of bruises and promises. [24] Mira stood among the overgrown hedges, her bare feet tangled in roots she had cultivated herself over seventeen years of waiting. [46] She was a root-bound visionary, they called her—someone who saw far but could never leave, her gift anchored to this sacred ground. [68]

The future had arrived early. [73] Three days ago, the great convergence that prophets had predicted for the next century simply happened, without warning, without ceremony. [92] Stars aligned decades ahead of schedule, and the eclipsed covenant—that ancient pact between dreamers and the waking world—shattered into fragments of possibility. [113] Now reality bled at its edges, and Mira was purposefully curious about what seeped through. [127]

She clutched the maze topiary clipping in her scarred palm, the last piece of the labyrinth her grandmother had tended before the covenant broke. [150] The hedge maze had dissolved overnight, its centuries of careful growth reduced to wild tangles, but this single cutting remained green and vital. [173] It hummed against her skin like a tuning fork. [182]

"You have to heed the signs," her grandmother had always said. [193] "Dreams have geography. Find where they cross, and you find truth." [205]

Mira had spent her life mapping that geography from this glade, never traveling physically but journeying through visions that left marks on her body. [228] Each scar told a story—the thin silver line on her forearm from dreaming of ice cliffs, the rough patch on her shoulder from a vision of desert suns. [256] She had learned to read others' scars too, linking through scars to understand their dream-paths, tracing the landscape of the unconscious through the evidence it left on flesh. [284]

Now, with the covenant eclipsed, those paths were colliding. [293] People arrived at the glade's edge daily, drawn by instinct they couldn't name, their scars glowing faintly in twilight. [312] They came seeking the intersection of dreams—that mythical point where all sleepers' journeys crossed, where collective meaning crystallized from private visions. [332]

Tonight, seven stood waiting. [336] Mira felt their scars calling to hers across the clearing. [346]

The anxious elation that had gripped her since the convergence intensified. [356] This was wrong and right simultaneously—the covenant's breaking meant chaos, but it also meant possibility. [372] For the first time, the intersection might be reachable by those bound to earth, not just those who could fly through dreamspace. [394]

She pressed the topiary clipping into the soil at her feet. [405] Immediately, roots erupted from its base, weaving with the ones already tangled around her ankles. [420] The hedge began to grow, but strangely—not upward, but outward in geometric patterns, recreating the maze in miniature around her. [441]

"Come closer," she called to the seven. [448] "Show me your marks." [452]

They approached through the deepening blue light, rolling up sleeves, lifting shirts, exposing the cartography of their unconscious travels. [469] A woman with burn scars shaped like wings. [477] A man whose keloid tissue formed spiraling paths. [485] A child with scratches that spelled words in no waking language. [496]

Mira read them all, linking through scars, feeling each person's dream-journey overlay her own internal map. [512] The topiary grew faster, its branches forming corridors that matched the patterns she perceived. [526] The clipping remembered its original maze and rebuilt it according to new specifications—the combined specifications of eight dreamers' unconscious minds. [545]

The intersection emerged at the maze's center. [552] Not a place, exactly, but a presence—the point where all their paths crossed, made visible now that the covenant no longer kept such things hidden. [576] It looked like a door made of overlapping shadows. [585]

Mira's roots strained against their earthly anchor. [592] She could see beyond the door, vast territories of shared meaning, the collective dream-landscape that humanity had always sensed but never accessed while waking. [615]

"We go together," she said, her voice trembling with anxious elation. [625] "Or not at all." [628]

The seven nodded. [631] They linked hands, scar to scar, forming a circuit of mapped journeys. [643] The topiary maze closed around them like a protective shell. [653]

Mira finally understood why she had been root-bound all these years—not as punishment, but as preparation. [669] Someone had to anchor the bridge between dreaming and waking, to hold the door steady while others crossed. [687]

The cobalt glade darkened toward true night. [694] Through the door, dawn was breaking over landscapes no one had walked before. [707] Mira heeded her grandmother's wisdom at last, finding the intersection not by leaving her roots, but by letting others grow from them. [729]

The future had arrived early, and they would meet it dreaming. [740]
