The observatory deck had been ambered for eons now, preserved in crystalline resin that caught light from dying stars and held it prisoner. [28] Mira stood at the central console, her fingers tracing the edges of her collection of foreign coins—currency from worlds that had folded back into the cosmic singularity, from civilizations that existed only in the contracting memory of spacetime. [62]

After the universe began its great inhalation, collapsing inward toward whatever came before the beginning, Mira had discovered her purpose was not to predict the future but to remember it. [92] The backwards prophecy had found her three cycles ago, arriving not as vision but as certainty of events that would un-happen. [112]

She was a cast lots decision maker by training, one of the last practitioners of chance-divination in a universe where probability itself was rewinding. [134] The coins she threw no longer fell randomly—they fell toward outcomes already determined by futures folding into pasts. [152] Each foreign coin represented a different thread of collapsed possibility, and she read their patterns the way her ancestors had read tea leaves and entrails. [176]

Today, she needed to distill meaning from static. [184]

The observatory's receivers still functioned, pulling in transmissions from the shrinking edge of reality, but the signals came backwards now, endings before beginnings, conclusions before premises. [210] Mira had spent decades understanding static bursts, learning to hear language in the chaos of cosmic background radiation. [228] What others heard as interference, she recognized as the universe speaking its final words first. [243]

She cast the coins across the amber-smooth surface of the navigation table. [255] A tetradrachm from the Kepler Confederacy landed face-down. [264] A hexagonal credit from the Andromeda Exchange spun three times before settling. [276] A small copper piece from Old Earth—her most treasured artifact—rolled to the edge and stopped. [292]

The pattern spoke of alignment. [297]

Mira felt quietly enthusiastic about this reading, though she had learned not to show her hopes openly. [314] In a contracting universe, enthusiasm itself was a form of rebellion against entropy's reversal. [328] She allowed herself only a small smile, a private acknowledgment that the coins had shown her what she needed. [346]

To wavelength align with purpose—that was her motivation, the driving force that kept her working at this ambered station while reality compressed around her. [369] She believed that consciousness could synchronize with the cosmic contraction, could ride the wave of un-becoming back to whatever source had started everything. [393] The backwards prophecy promised this was possible, though it offered no guarantees. [406]

Stellar doubt crept into her thoughts, as it always did. [416] What if she was reading the signals wrong? [424] What if the prophecy was merely her mind creating meaning where none existed, a final delusion before annihilation? [440] The stars themselves seemed uncertain now, their light blue-shifting as they rushed toward the center, as if they too questioned whether any of this made sense. [466]

She gathered the coins and cast them again. [475]

This time, the static in her receivers peaked, and she leaned closer, filtering the bursts through years of trained intuition. [494] The message came backwards, as all messages did now: "—beginning the reach you before ending your start must you—" [512]

Mira translated, reversing the sequence: "You must start your ending before you reach the beginning." [527]

The backwards prophecy clarified itself with each casting, each distillation of noise into signal. [541] She understood now that alignment was not about surviving the contraction but about accepting dissolution as transformation. [557] Her foreign coins would melt back into ore, into stellar dust, into the primordial unity that preceded separation. [574]

She placed each coin deliberately on the amber surface, arranging them in a spiral that mirrored the galaxy's collapse. [592] The observatory deck hummed with ancient purpose, its preservation finally meaningful—not as protection against time but as witness to its reversal. [614]

Mira cast the lots one final time. [621]

Every coin landed on edge, an impossibility that confirmed everything. [631] She was quietly enthusiastic now, fully allowing herself the emotion, because the static bursts had resolved into a single clear tone, and her wavelength finally matched the frequency of the dying universe. [663]

The amber began to glow. [668]

She had distilled a lifetime of doubt into one moment of certainty. [681] The backwards prophecy had always been about this: not knowing what would happen, but trusting that un-happening was just another way of becoming. [704]

As the observatory contracted with everything else, Mira aligned herself with purpose and let the universe remember her into being. [724]
