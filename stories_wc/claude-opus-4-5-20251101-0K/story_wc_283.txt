The amber warehouse beneath the cliffs had not heard a human voice in seventeen years. [14]

Marlowe descended the rope ladder into that unearthed silence, her boots finding purchase on fossilized crates that once held honey from a civilization now forgotten. [39] As an hourglass turner, she had spent her life reversing time's small catastrophes—mending broken moments, unsticking frozen seconds—but this assignment demanded something different. [59] She needed to spin a prophecy into raw possibility, to transform what was written into what could be. [76]

The warehouse stretched before her in amber-tinted darkness, its walls carved directly from the cliff face. [91] Stalactites of crystallized resin hung from the ceiling like frozen tears. [103] Somewhere in this repository of abandoned things lay the answer to a riddle that had consumed three generations of her family. [123]

Her grandmother had been the first to hear the prophecy: that the world would end not with fire or flood, but with forgetting. [145] Already, Marlowe had watched entire languages dissolve from human memory, seen people wake unable to recall their own children's names. [165] The forgetting spread like morning frost, and no amount of turning hourglasses could reverse it. [180]

She found the first button near a toppled shelf of amber-encased beetles. [192] Small, bone-white, carved with a symbol she almost recognized. [202] Then another, black jet, hidden in a crack. [211] Then a third, mother-of-pearl, gleaming beneath dust. [219]

Marlowe understood. [221]

She began cataloging lost buttons with the methodical patience of someone who had learned that time reveals its secrets only to those who wait. [244] Each button she found had belonged to someone—a coat, a dress, a uniform—and each carried a fragment of memory that the forgetting had not yet claimed. [271] By cataloging them, she began to unscramble something larger: a pattern, a message, a truth that had been scattered across decades. [292]

Hours passed. [294] Her collection grew to forty-seven buttons, arranged on the stone floor in the order she'd discovered them. [312] When she stepped back, she saw that they formed a constellation—the same shape as the birthmark on her left shoulder, the same pattern her grandmother had once drawn in flour on the kitchen table. [346]

In the constellation's center sat a jar she had initially dismissed as empty. [360] But when she lifted it to the amber light filtering through the cliff's cracks, she heard it: a canyon echo in a jar, captured and preserved like the insects around her. [392] The echo spoke in her grandmother's voice, then her mother's, then voices she did not recognize—a chain of women stretching back through centuries, each adding their understanding to the whole. [422]

Shared wisdom, Marlowe realized. [426] The prophecy wasn't a prediction. [431] It was an instruction manual, passed down in fragments, protected by being scattered. [443] The forgetting was not a curse but a cleansing, and the world that emerged on the other side would only survive if someone remembered how to rebuild it. [469]

She pressed the jar to her ear as the truth unraveled like thread from a spool. [485] The voices told her about seeds hidden in mountain caves, about water sources that would remain pure, about the exact moment when she would need to turn her hourglass backward instead of forward—not to reverse time, but to create a pocket where new time could grow. [529]

Marlowe sat quietly inspired in that amber darkness, surrounded by buttons and beetles and the weight of responsibility. [546] She had come seeking a way to prevent the end. [556] Instead, she had found instructions for a beginning. [564]

The echo in the jar faded to silence, its wisdom now transferred to her own memory—the one place the forgetting could not reach, because she had been born with her grandmother's gift for holding onto what mattered. [599] She gathered the buttons carefully, each one a key to a different door that would need opening when the time came. [620]

Above her, the cliffs groaned with the weight of centuries. [631] Below, the amber warehouse waited, patient as honey, for the next keeper of scattered truths. [646] Marlowe began her climb back toward the surface, toward a world still forgetting, carrying possibility in a jar and salvation in her pockets. [669]

The silence of the warehouse settled behind her like a held breath. [682] It had kept its secrets for seventeen years. [691] Now those secrets walked upward on steady legs, ready to become something more than prophecy. [706]

Ready to become tomorrow. [710]
