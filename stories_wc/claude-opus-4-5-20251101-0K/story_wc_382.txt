The first time I knocked on Professor Elara Voss's door, I only wanted sugar. [16]

She had been dead for three years before I moved into the apartment below hers, though no one thought to mention this until much later. [39] The building superintendent simply said the top floor was occupied by a quiet tenant who kept unusual hours. [55] When I climbed the fire escape that September evening, seeking a cup of sugar for a cake I would never bake, I found her tending roses on the rooftop garden, her silver hair catching starlight. [87]

"You're here about the sugar," she said, not turning around. [97] "Everyone starts with sugar." [101]

I should have questioned how she knew. [108] I should have questioned many things. [114] But the rooftop garden sprawled before me like a secret language, every stone and beam arranged with intention, and I understood immediately that Professor Voss could teach me to read it. [145]

She had been a tutor of dead languages in life, Sanskrit and Sumerian and tongues that had crumbled with their civilizations. [166] Now she tutored in a different kind of archaeology. [175]

"Buildings speak," she explained during our second tea session, the following Wednesday. [186] Her hands moved with patient nimbleness across an antique desk seal she used as a paperweight, fingers tracing its worn inscription. [204] "But their language is dying too. [210] Soon no one will remember how to listen to the complaints of old foundations or the memories held in window glass." [229]

I watched meteors streak across the October sky, our weekly ritual now established. [241] The rooftop garden had become a classroom, and the building beneath us served as our primary text. [257]

"Why me?" [259] I finally asked. [262]

Professor Voss smiled, that expression of mysterious familiarity she wore like a second face. [275] "You heard the elevator singing last month. [282] You apologized to the banister when you scratched it. [291] The building told me you were ready." [298]

I did not ask how a dead woman received messages from architecture. [310] We had agreed upon lies between us, unspoken but understood. [320] She was simply a neighbor who kept unusual hours. [329] I was simply a student seeking knowledge. [336] The tea was simply tea, the sugar was simply sugar, and the meteors falling around us were not measuring out the borrowed time we shared. [358]

She taught me to interrogate the building's secrets with gentleness. [368] To press my palm against load-bearing walls and feel the weight of decades. [381] To read the settlement cracks like sentences and interpret the groaning pipes like poetry. [394] The antique desk seal, she explained, had belonged to an architect who understood this language two centuries ago. [411] He had pressed it into wax on letters to buildings, formal correspondence that acknowledged their sentience. [425]

"The seal recognizes those who can learn," she said, pressing it into my hand. [439] Its brass surface was warm despite the autumn chill. [448] "Consider it your certificate of enrollment." [454]

By November, I could hear the building's morning stretches. [463] By December, I understood its lullabies. [469] By January, when the rooftop garden lay dormant under frost and Professor Voss's form had grown translucent as old curtains, I could read the entire structure like a memoir. [496]

"You'll need to find new students," she said during our final tea session. [510] A January meteor shower painted the sky, rare and significant. [520] "Start with sugar. [523] It always works." [526]

I wanted to interrogate her about what came next, about where tutors of dead languages go when their teaching is complete. [545] But some questions honor the agreed upon lies we need to survive. [557]

She faded with the last meteor's arc, leaving only the desk seal pressed against my palm and roses that would somehow bloom despite the frost. [580]

The building hummed its goodbye. [585]

Now I tend the rooftop garden, and I keep sugar stocked in quantities no reasonable person needs. [601] When new tenants move into the apartments below, the building whispers their names to me, identifies those who might hear its stories. [621]

Last week, a young architect knocked on my door with an empty measuring cup and uncertain eyes. [638]

"You're here about the sugar," I said, not turning around. [648] "Everyone starts with sugar." [652]

The building sighed with satisfaction beneath us, its old bones settling into the posture of a patient teacher, and I understood finally that some languages survive by choosing their speakers carefully, passing from voice to voice like heirlooms, like secrets, like the borrowed sweetness that opens every door. [704]

The rooftop garden waited. [708] The tea kettle sang. [712] Another student had arrived, and the dead language would live a little longer. [725]
