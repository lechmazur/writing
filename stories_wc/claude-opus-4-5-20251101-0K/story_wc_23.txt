The hydraulics failed on a Tuesday, and Mira stayed anyway. [10]

Everyone else evacuated the starlit signal station when the great rotating beacon seized mid-turn, its mechanical joints groaning like something wounded. [30] But Mira had nowhere else to go, and the geography of loss had already claimed every other place she'd ever called home. [50]

She was a patchwork navigator by necessity, not training. [59] Her charts were stitched together from her grandmother's hand-drawn coastlines, her father's tide tables, and her own desperate annotations made during the three years since the Departure. [84] That's what the officials called it—the Departure—when half the coastal population migrated inland, fleeing rising waters and failing infrastructure. [103]

But Mira had discovered something the officials didn't understand: some things needed to return. [117]

The bronze censer foot sat on her workstation, its patina green-black from decades of salt air. [132] It was the only piece she'd recovered from her mother's shrine, the rest lost when their village went under. [150] She'd found it washed up on the station's rocks three months ago, as if the sea itself was practicing reverse migration, returning what it had swallowed. [175]

That's when the midnight calls began. [181]

The station's emergency landline still worked, fed by cables buried too deep for the failing hydraulics to affect. [198] Every night when the moon rose, the phone would ring. [208] The caller never identified themselves, only spoke in fragments: coordinates, dates, names of the drowned. [223]

"Thirty-seven degrees north," the voice would rasp. [230] "Sixteen fathoms. The fishing nets remember." [236]

Mira wrote everything down. [240] Her ability to interpret the cryptic messages fluctuated with the moon phases—during full moons, the patterns crystallized into perfect clarity, and she could plot exact locations on her patchwork charts. [268] During new moons, the words scattered like static, and she could only wait. [282]

Tonight, the moon hung three-quarters full, and Mira was ready to build. [294]

Not repair—the station's hydraulics were beyond saving. [302] Instead, she was constructing something new from the bones of the old: a manual signal array, cobbled together from salvaged mirrors and the beacon's shattered lenses. [328] If she couldn't rotate the light mechanically, she would redirect starlight itself, bouncing it between reflective surfaces to create a new kind of navigation. [352]

The phone rang at exactly midnight. [358]

"The reverse migration begins at the winter solstice," the voice said, clearer than it had ever been. [375] "They're coming back. Not the living—the lost. Guide them home." [387]

Mira's hand trembled as she gripped the bronze censer foot, its cool weight grounding her. [402] She understood now. [405] The Departure hadn't just been people fleeing inland. [413] Something essential had been torn loose—memories, spirits, the accumulated meaning of generations who'd lived and died by these waters. [431]

She had to build a beacon not for ships, but for souls. [443]

Through the station's cracked windows, she could see the stars wheeling overhead, indifferent and eternal. [458] But the sea below churned with purpose, each wave carrying whispers of what had been taken. [474] Her mother's voice. [477] Her father's laugh. [480] The smell of incense burning in a shrine that no longer existed. [492]

Mira worked through the night, her hands raw from handling broken glass and corroded metal. [508] She positioned each mirror according to the coordinates the midnight caller had provided, creating a constellation of reflections that would only align properly during specific lunar phases. [536]

When dawn approached, she placed the bronze censer foot at the array's center—not because it served any mechanical purpose, but because some kinds of navigation required an anchor to memory. [565]

The signal station would never guide physical vessels again. [574] But as Mira watched the first test of her creation—starlight fracturing into a thousand directed beams that swept across the water—she felt something shift in the geography of her grief. [603]

The reverse migration wasn't about bringing back what was lost. [613] It was about creating a path for loss itself to find meaning, to transform from absence into presence of a different kind. [634]

The phone rang one final time. [640]

"Well done, navigator," the voice said, and Mira recognized it at last—her own voice, older, returned from some future where the work was already complete. [665] "Now keep the light burning. They're almost home." [674]

She hung up and watched the horizon, where the first returning lights were already beginning to gather, drawn by a beacon built from salvage and sorrow, flickering in raw solace against the endless dark. [708]
