The tea house had been forgotten by everyone except the vines. [11]

Mei discovered it three autumns ago, after the birds flew south and left the palace courtyard in silence. [28] The overgrown jasmine and creeping fig had swallowed the small wooden structure so completely that she walked past it twice before noticing the door. [52] But noticing was what Mei did. [58] She noticed things that crept—changes so gradual that others forgot there had ever been another way. [74]

She noticed when the bakery on Chrysanthemum Street vanished overnight, though her neighbors insisted it had never existed. [91] She noticed when the temple bells stopped ringing at dawn, and when the old songs disappeared from the radio one verse at a time. [115] She noticed the slow erasure of memory that passed for normalcy in the city below the palace walls. [133]

Now she sat in the tea house each morning, her fingers wrapped around a chipped cup, and she noticed herself becoming gentle with the world's wounds rather than furious. [162] This heuristically gentle approach—learning tenderness through trial and error—had cost her years of rage before she understood that observation required patience, not force. [186]

On this particular morning, frost still clung to the wild roses outside. [198] Mei unwrapped the cloth bundle she'd carried from home and stared at the small loaf inside. [214] Bread from the vanished bakery. [219] She'd found it in her grandmother's freezer last week, preserved in plastic wrap with a date from seven years ago. [239] The bakery's name was printed on the wrapper in faded blue ink: Chen Family Bread, Est. 1923. [256]

Her grandmother remembered the bakery. [261] Her mother did not. [265] Her younger sister looked at Mei with concern when she mentioned it, as though forgetting were healthy and remembering were a symptom of something broken. [290]

Mei broke off a small piece of the bread, now thawed and stale but still carrying the ghost of its original sweetness. [312] She placed it on the wooden table like an offering. [322]

This was her method of uncloaking the disappeared: through guerrilla gardening. [333] In the palace courtyard, she had planted seeds from extinct varieties—tomatoes that no longer appeared in markets, flowers that had been bred out of existence for more fashionable hybrids, herbs that healers once used before they were dismissed as superstition. [372] Each plant was an act of recovery, a refusal to let the gradual vanishing complete itself. [388]

The bread would not grow, but she could plant what it represented. [400] She had saved seeds from a wheat variety that the Chen family had used for three generations. [417] After tea, she would dig a small bed near the eastern wall and commit them to the soil. [435]

Was this absolution? [438] The word felt too heavy, too certain. [445] What Mei sought was more tenuous—not forgiveness for the world's forgetfulness, but perhaps a temporary reprieve from the weight of being the one who remembered. [470] If the wheat grew, if someone else found this garden someday and asked questions, then maybe the burden would distribute itself across other shoulders. [494]

The tea cooled in her hands. [500] A spider had built its web in the corner of the tea house, and Mei watched it work with the patience she had cultivated over years of loss. [528] The sacred was here, she knew—in the steam rising from her cup, in the bread's stubborn sweetness, in the spider's geometry. [550] Finding the sacred in the ordinary was not escapism; it was the only honest response to a world that kept trying to make the extraordinary disappear. [575]

She finished her tea and stepped outside with her seeds and her small trowel. [589] The courtyard held its breath around her, wild and overgrown and alive with things that refused to be forgotten. [607] She knelt in the cold soil and began to dig, her movements slow and deliberate, heuristically gentle with the earth as she had learned to be gentle with herself. [638]

The wheat would grow or it would not. [647] The garden would be discovered or it would remain hidden. [657] But today, in the quiet after the birds had flown south, a woman who noticed creeping normality planted seeds against erasure. [677]

She covered them with soil and whispered the bakery's name. [687]

Chen Family Bread, Est. 1923. [692]

The wind carried nothing back, but Mei had stopped expecting answers. [703] She only expected to keep asking, keep planting, keep noticing the slow disappearances that others had already forgotten. [720] This was her tenuous absolution—not being forgiven, but refusing to participate in the forgetting. [735]

She gathered her things and left the tea house to the vines, knowing she would return tomorrow. [751]

The spider continued its work in the corner, patient and precise, building something beautiful that no one else would see. [770]
