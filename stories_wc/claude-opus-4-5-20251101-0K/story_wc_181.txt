The curator had never understood why her grandmother left her an asteroid, but standing now in the astral orchard as silver blossoms drifted upward instead of down, Maren finally began to question the right questions. [41]

The trees grew from nothing—no soil, no water, just the black rock of the asteroid and whatever strange light filtered through the membrane that kept her breathing. [68] Each tree bore fruit that looked like memories crystallized into something edible, and Maren was bewildered by all of it, as she had been bewildered since the reading of the will six months ago. [99]

Six months, and yet here, time moved differently. [108] The lawyer had explained that Maren would inherit "between the first and last page," which she'd assumed was poetic nonsense until she opened the leather journal and found herself standing among impossible orchards. [139]

In her palm, she held the only object that had accompanied her: a pistachio shell cameo blank, smooth and waiting for an image that had never been carved. [166] Her grandmother had worn it as a pendant for sixty years, this incomplete thing, and now Maren understood it was meant to remain incomplete. [189] The inheritance was not the asteroid or the orchard or even the journal—it was the question the blank represented. [208]

She walked deeper into the grove, and the brightened disquiet that had settled in her chest since arrival intensified. [225] Everything here felt simultaneously welcoming and wrong, like a smile from someone who knew too much about your future. [243]

A small structure emerged between two flowering trees—a bathroom, inexplicably. [254] Marble floors, a gilt-framed mirror, a toilet that shouldn't exist on an asteroid but did. [269] Maren had learned not to question such things. [278]

She stepped inside and closed the door. [285]

Her grandmother's notes had mentioned this: "The breakthroughs come in bathrooms. Don't ask why. Just trust the tiles." [301] Maren sat on the closed toilet lid and stared at her reflection, and the forbidden knowledge she'd been chasing since childhood—since her grandmother first whispered about family secrets that moved backward through time—began to crystallize. [341]

"Why did you leave me this?" she asked her reflection, inquiring of the ghost she half-expected to appear. [359]

The answer came not as a voice but as understanding, simply complicated in the way all true things are. [377] Nonlinear inheritance meant exactly what it said: the orchard had belonged to Maren first, passed backward to her grandmother, then forward again. [399] The family didn't inherit from ancestors. [405] They inherited from themselves, from futures that hadn't happened yet, from pasts that would only exist once the knowledge was properly carried. [425]

Maren looked at the cameo blank and understood it was waiting for her to carve herself into it—not her image, but her comprehension. [449] The forbidden knowledge wasn't forbidden because it was dangerous. [459] It was forbidden because knowing it made you responsible for its continuation. [471]

She left the bathroom changed. [476]

The orchard stretched endlessly now, or perhaps it always had and she simply hadn't possessed the eyes to see. [495] Other structures dotted the grove: a kitchen where someone had brewed tea that still steamed, a study filled with books she would write, a nursery for a child who would teach her grandmother everything she knew. [531]

Time here was a river that flowed in every direction simultaneously. [542] Maren was the curator of this place—not because her grandmother had appointed her, but because she had always been, would always be, had retroactively created the position for herself. [571]

She pressed her thumbnail into the pistachio shell and began to carve the first line: not a face, but a map. [593] The orchard needed documenting. [597] The blossoms needed cataloging. [601] The knowledge that had been forbidden to her as a child was now her sacred duty to preserve and pass backward and forward through the family line. [626]

In the journal, new pages appeared even as old ones faded, and Maren understood she would exist here, working, forever—or at least between the first and last page, which was perhaps the same thing. [661]

The asteroid continued its lonely orbit around a star she couldn't name, and the astral orchard blossomed in perpetual silver spring, and Maren carved and cataloged and wondered, bewildered still but purposefully so. [696]

Some inheritances, she realized, weren't meant to be understood. [706] They were meant to be inhabited, lived in, grown into like a shell waiting sixty years for the creature complex enough to call it home. [732]

She smiled at the brightened disquiet humming in her bones, and returned to the bathroom to chase her next breakthrough. [751]
