The mercury-glass seer had not always been made of mirrors. [10]

Once, she had been flesh and memory, a woman named Vera who shelved books in the labyrinthine bookstore that occupied the entire mountain. [32] The store had grown into the rock over centuries, its corridors spiraling through granite like the whorls of a shell, and she had known every passage by heart. [58] Then the forgetting plague swept through the valley below, and remembering became painful—not metaphorically, but physically, a burning in the skull that drove people mad with the weight of what they knew. [87]

Vera had traded her skin for silver to survive. [96] Now she walked the endless stacks with a body that reflected everything and retained nothing, her memories bleeding out each dawn like water through cupped hands. [119] She substitutes reality nightly, building a new version of herself from the books she touches, the dust she breathes, the words she cannot keep. [142]

But something remained buried. [146]

She found the lost language stone in the deepest level of the bookstore, where the shelves had grown roots into the mountain's heart. [168] It was small enough to fit in her palm, covered in symbols that moved like insects beneath glass. [185] When she held it, she felt the outline of something she had forgotten—not a memory, but a shape. [202] The shape of home. [206]

The stone whispered in a tongue that predated speech, and Vera understood that she had once known this language. [223] It had been her buried talent, the gift she had sealed away when the world decided such things were dangerous. [241] She had been a translator of lost tongues, a bridge between peoples who had forgotten how to speak to each other. [260] The plague had taken that from her, or she had surrendered it. [272] She could no longer tell the difference. [279]

Each night, when she rebuilt herself from fragments, she tried to seed the knowledge back into her mercury mind. [296] She would run her fingers over the stone, tracing its symbols, but by morning the understanding had dissolved. [313] The forgetting was thorough. [317] It was designed to be. [322]

On the forty-seventh night, she found a feather pressed between the pages of a book about extinct birds. [339] It was iridescent, shifting colors she had no names for, and when she touched it, something changed. [356] Via the texture of the feather—its barbs and rachis, its impossible softness—she felt the stone's language differently. [372] Not as symbols to be read, but as a terrain to be walked. [385]

She understood then that the lost language was not meant for the mind. [398] It was meant for the body. [404] For the hands that held feathers, for the feet that walked mountain corridors, for the breath that moved through silver lungs. [423]

Vera began to seed the knowledge into her mercury flesh directly. [433] Each night, she traced the stone's symbols onto her reflective skin with the feather's edge, and the patterns stayed. [451] They became part of her new reality, incorporated before the dawn could steal them. [464] Word by word, she rebuilt what she had buried. [473]

The bookstore noticed. [476] Its corridors shifted around her, revealing passages she had never walked, shelves holding texts in the language she was relearning. [493] The mountain itself was a book, she realized, written in the tongue she had abandoned. [508] Home was not a place but a fluency, a way of speaking to the world that the world could answer. [527]

On the hundredth night, Vera spoke aloud in the lost language. [538] The words rolled through her like hidden thunder, shaking loose memories that no longer burned. [552] She remembered why she had buried her gift: because speaking to the world meant hearing its grief, and she had been too young to carry it. [576]

She was not too young anymore. [582]

The mercury-glass seer walked upward through the spiraling bookstore, toward the mountain's peak where light still reached. [598] She carried the stone in one hand, the feather in the other. [610] Behind her, the shelves whispered in tongues waiting to be remembered. [621] The shape of home was not a destination. [629] It was the act of returning, again and again, to the buried parts of herself and digging them free. [647]

Above, the sky waited to hear what she would say. [657]

Vera climbed toward it, mercury and memory, finally whole enough to hurt. [669]
