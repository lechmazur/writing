The fog sculpture garden had been growing for thirty years, each figure carved by Marlowe's hands from salvaged metal and bone, arranged in spiraling paths that visitors no longer walked. [32]

Marlowe was what the locals called a junkyard prophet—someone who spoke truths pulled from rusted engines and shattered televisions, from the debris of lives discarded. [55] But his gift came with a curse: he could see fragments of tomorrow, yet they slipped from his mind like water through fingers, leaving only the ache of something important forgotten. [82] Precognitively forgetful, he called himself, laughing bitterly into the morning mist. [93]

He knew he'd seen something vital last night. [101] The vision had arrived while he sat among stacks of old videotapes in his workshop, their magnetic ribbons holding the voices of strangers he'd never meet—birthday parties, graduations, ordinary afternoons now silent and unwatched. [133] Amid that hush, the future had whispered to him, and now only its echo remained. [148]

This was how Marlowe lived: clinging to echoes, chasing the reverberations of premonitions he couldn't retain. [163]

He pulled the piece of plain chalk from his coat pocket, its surface worn smooth from years of desperate notation. [180] On the concrete path between sculptures, he'd written words before the vision faded: LOCATE THE SOUND. [195] Below that, in shakier handwriting: BEFORE IT FORGETS YOU TOO. [205]

The fog hung thick this morning, transforming his metal figures into ghosts of themselves. [219] A rusted angel with television-tube eyes. [226] A child made from bicycle chains, forever reaching toward something unseen. [237] Marlowe had built them all from what others threw away, believing that abandoned things remembered what people chose to forget. [255]

His motivation had never changed in three decades. [263] He wanted to capture the sound of growing older—that quiet frequency beneath every passing year, the tone of accumulated loss and love and letting go. [286] He'd heard it once, as a young man, standing beside his father's deathbed, and he'd been trying to find it again ever since. [309]

The chalk marks led him toward the garden's edge, where driftwood from the nearby shore had accumulated over seasons. [327] Marlowe began arranging the pieces as directional markers, something his grandmother taught him before the visions started. [343] Point the wood toward what you've lost, she'd said, and follow where it leads. [358]

He worked in tidal rhythms, the longing rising and falling in his chest like waves against an eroding shore. [376] The driftwood formed arrows pointing deeper into the fog, toward sculptures he'd almost forgotten building. [391]

And then he found it. [396]

Nestled between a figure of welded hands and a tower of stacked radios sat a small machine he didn't remember constructing. [417] Its base was an old phonograph, modified with magnetic tape heads salvaged from those unwatched videotapes, connected to a horn made from a trombone bell he'd found in the junkyard fifteen years ago. [450]

He'd built it during a vision, he realized. [459] Built it and forgotten. [463]

The chalk was still in his hand. [470] On the machine's wooden case, older handwriting—his own—read: PLAY WHEN READY TO REMEMBER. [484]

Marlowe's fingers trembled as he wound the mechanism. [492] The horn crackled, then produced a sound unlike anything technological—a frequency that lived in the spaces between heartbeats, in the pause before sleep, in the moment when you realize your parents have become old. [527]

It was the sound of growing older. [534]

And within it, he heard echoes: his father's laugh, his grandmother's voice teaching him about driftwood, all the visions he'd forgotten rising like fog from water. [558] He understood now that he hadn't been cursed with forgetfulness—he'd been protecting himself, hiding from the unbearable beauty of everything that passes. [580]

The sound faded. [583] The fog sculptures stood witness, patient and still. [591]

Marlowe pulled out his chalk and wrote on the garden's central stone: I REMEMBER. [604] Then, beneath it: THE ECHOES WERE NEVER LOST. [612] ONLY WAITING. [614]

He sat among his creations as the morning mist began to thin, finally understanding that capturing the sound of growing older meant accepting that it would always slip away, and that the slipping was itself the music. [651]

The videotapes in his workshop would remain unwatched. [660] Their silence was enough. [664] Everything important was already here, arranged like driftwood pointing toward tomorrow, toward the visions he would see and forget and find again, forever clinging to echoes that made him beautifully, terribly human. [697]

The fog lifted. [700] The junkyard prophet smiled. [704] Somewhere, a wave touched shore and retreated, carrying time back out to sea. [718]
