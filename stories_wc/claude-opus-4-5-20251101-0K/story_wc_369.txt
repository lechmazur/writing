The labyrinth beneath the Stormlit Tower had been Maren's responsibility for seventeen years. [14] She knew every turn, every dead end, every place where the hedges grew too thick and needed trimming back with her curved blade. [35] Tonight, however, she climbed instead of descended, ascending the spiral stairs toward the astronomer's abandoned study where rain hammered the windows like desperate fingers. [56]

In her pocket, wrapped in oilcloth, she carried the broken sextant. [67] Old Vestris had left it to her in his will, along with a note that simply read: "The trees remember what we forget. [86] Map the dreams, Maren. [90] You'll understand." [92]

She hadn't understood, not for three months. [99] But then the sorrow had started—not vague sadness, but something precise, measurable, arriving in waves she could almost count. [117] Fourteen units when she passed the ancient oak at the labyrinth's heart. [128] Twenty-three when she touched the willow by the northern fountain. [138] Forty-one when she stood beneath the cypress that had watched the tower for eight hundred years. [153]

Quantified sorrow, she had started calling it. [160] Each tree held a specific weight of grief, accumulated from every person who had ever rested in their shade, wept against their bark, or whispered secrets to their leaves. [186] The trees witnessed everything, and now, somehow, she could feel it. [197]

The astronomer's study smelled of dust and old starlight. [206] Maren set the sextant on the worktable as lightning illuminated the room, followed by the bass rumble of thunder rolling across distant hills. [228] The moon emerged between storm clouds, silver light streaming through the cracked window. [241]

The sextant began to heal. [246]

She watched, breath held, as the bent brass straightened itself, as the shattered mirror reassembled piece by piece. [263] The instrument drank moonlight like water, fractures sealing, tarnish fading, until it gleamed as if newly made. [280]

"Mundane miracles," Vestris had always called such things. [288] The small magics hiding in plain sight, the ones nobody bothered to notice because they expected magic to be grand. [307]

With the sextant whole, Maren understood what she needed to do. [318] She began to deconstruct the mechanism, carefully removing each component and laying them out in precise order. [335] The mirrors, the arc, the index arm, the filters—each piece represented a different angle of observation. [350] Not of stars, she realized now, but of dreams. [359]

The trees' dreams. [362]

By mapping scattered dreams, Vestris's note had said. [370] The old astronomer hadn't been charting constellations in his final years. [381] He'd been charting the collective unconscious of the ancient grove surrounding the labyrinth, using the sextant to triangulate where memories gathered thickest. [400]

Maren began reassembling the device with new purpose, aligning the mirrors to capture not starlight but the silvered reflection of sleeping minds. [420] The cypress dreamed of plague years. [426] The oak dreamed of lovers' meetings, of duels, of a child buried beneath its roots four centuries past. [443] The willow dreamed of floods and of the woman who had planted it to remember her drowned son. [460]

At the moment a pin is heard in a silent corridor—that precise, crystalline instant when all sound stops—Maren completed her work. [480] The storm held its breath. [485] The tower fell utterly quiet. [490] And the sextant, now pointed through the window at the moonlit grove below, showed her everything. [506]

Numbers cascaded through her vision: the exact measure of every witnessed joy and tragedy the trees had absorbed. [522] She saw her own grief among them, the forty-one units she'd left beneath the cypress when she'd learned her sister had died. [543] The trees had taken it, held it, kept it safe. [553]

Not stolen. [555] Witnessed. [556]

The labyrinth existed, she understood now, because someone had to tend the living things that remembered for us. [572] The paths wound between trees not as obstacles but as pilgrimage routes, leading seekers to deposit their sorrow where it could be held in bark and ring and root. [599]

Maren descended the stairs at dawn, the healed sextant hanging at her belt. [612] Her work had changed. [616] She was still a maintenance worker, but now she maintained something larger than hedgerows—she maintained the delicate balance between human grief and arboreal memory, ensuring the trees could continue their quiet, essential witnessing. [648]

Outside, the labyrinth waited, washed clean by rain, every leaf holding captured storm and gathered moonlight. [664] She knelt beside the oak and pressed her palm to its bark. [676]

"Thank you," she whispered. [680]

The tree, in its way, whispered back—through the sextant's gentle vibration, through the morning light warming her face, through the mundane miracle of being heard. [704]

Fourteen units of old grief released like breath. [712]

The cypress still held forty-one, but that was all right. [722] Some sorrows were meant to be kept, witnessed, remembered. [731] Maren smiled and began her morning rounds, trimming hedges, clearing paths, mapping the dreams that drifted like leaves through the labyrinth's living heart. [754]
