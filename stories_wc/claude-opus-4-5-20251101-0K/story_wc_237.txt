The floating rock drifted through amber twilight, suspended above clouds that churned with the memory of one tempest and the promise of another. [26] Mira knelt on the weathered stone platform, her apprentice robes pooling around her like spilled ink, and tried to remember how to breathe. [49]

The tea ceremony required stillness. [54] Her mentor had explained this before departing on the previous wind-ship, leaving Mira alone with porcelain cups, dried leaves, and the weight of her first solo ritual. [77] The crow quill trimmed tip lay beside the ceremonial scroll, its edge sharp enough to inscribe the runes she had spent three years learning to read but never dared to write. [106]

She lifted the kettle. [110] Steam curled upward, and in its rising, she saw the old lightning scar that branched across her forearm—a souvenir from the storm that had killed her grandmother's orchard and sent seven-year-old Mira screaming into the root cellar. [148]

The memory triggered it. [152] Along her fingertips, frost began to crystallize, spreading in delicate fractals across her knuckles. [166] She inhaled sharply and held the breath, as her grandmother had taught her during those long cellar hours. [183] Count the crows, little one. [188] One for sorrow, two for joy. [194] The old superstition surfaced unbidden, and Mira found herself scanning the bruised sky. [207]

Three crows circled the platform's edge. [213] Three for a girl, she thought, and something in her chest loosened. [225]

The ice receded. [228]

She poured the tea with trembling hands, watching the liquid fill the first cup—meant for ancestors—then the second—meant for storms—then the third, which she would drink herself. [258] This was the breath between storms, that sacred pause when scholars could petition the sky for knowledge. [275] Her petition was simple: she wanted to understand why her body turned to ice whenever fear found her, and whether the runes could teach her to transform this curse into something useful. [307]

The crow quill waited. [311]

Mira picked it up, feeling the trimmed tip's precision against her thumb. [323] Rune scholars spent decades perfecting their inscriptions, but the oldest texts spoke of another path—one where the body itself became the page. [345] She had found that passage in a water-damaged manuscript, dismissed by her mentor as folk nonsense. [362] But folk nonsense was simply superstition that had survived. [371]

She dipped the quill into the tea meant for storms. [381]

The first stroke crossed her scar. [387] Not cutting—just tracing, letting the warm liquid seep into the old wound's geography. [400] She drew the rune for memory, then the rune for release. [412] The platform shuddered beneath her, caught in crosswinds from the approaching front, but Mira stayed fixed in that held breath, counting heartbeats instead of crows. [441]

Ice began forming again along her wrists, but this time she did not fight it. [457] She drew the rune for transformation directly onto the crystallizing skin. [468] The frost crackled, then shed from her arms in glittering sheets that caught the dying light and scattered like startled birds. [489]

Beneath, her scar remained—but changed. [495] The lightning-branch pattern now held faint iridescence, as though the tea and quill had left behind a map of something larger than old pain. [519]

Mira exhaled. [521]

The breath between storms ended. [526] Thunder rolled across the cloud-sea below, and rain began to fall in silver curtains around the platform's edge. [544] But the stone remained dry at its center, protected by whatever ancient craft kept it aloft, and Mira sat within that pocket of stillness like a secret kept by the sky itself. [578]

She lifted the third cup and drank. [585] The tea tasted of char and honey, of storms already weathered and storms yet to come. [600] Tomorrow she would return to the academy and show her mentor what she had learned. [614] She would explain that the ice was not a flaw to be purged but a language to be spoken. [632] She would write her scars into stories that other frightened children might one day read and recognize. [649]

For now, she simply existed in the saturated hush of rain meeting stone, of old wounds becoming new alphabets, of a budding scholar finally understanding that the space between terrors was not empty—it was where the real work began. [694]

The crows settled on the platform's edge, watching her with ink-drop eyes. [707] Four for a boy, five for silver, six for gold. [717] Seven, her grandmother used to say, for a secret never told. [729]

Mira smiled and began counting. [734]
