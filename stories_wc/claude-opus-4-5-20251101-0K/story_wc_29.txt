The basement of Harrington Hall smelled of burnt coffee and old electronics, a fitting tomb for WXHU's broadcast equipment. [21] Mira Chen adjusted her headphones and studied the astronomical charts spread across the console, their concentric circles and declination lines marked with her own crimson annotations. [44] Three weeks ago, she had been a graduate student in astrophysics, mapping stellar drift patterns. [57] Now she was the only celestial signal interpreter the university had left, the only one who understood what was really coming through the static. [77]

The signal had first appeared during a routine observation of Sagittarius A. [88] Most researchers dismissed it as interference, but Mira had isolated the pattern—a subsonic frequency embedded beneath the normal radio waves, pulsing in mathematical sequences that predated human civilization. [115] The beings on the other end weren't gods, despite what the growing cult on campus believed. [130] They were tricksters, cosmic entities that fed on chaos and division, and they were using the university's own transmitter to broadcast their influence across the community. [155]

Through the booth's grimy window, Mira watched Professor Aldridge lead another candlelit procession across the quad. [169] Half the faculty had joined his Communion of the Ascending Voice, convinced the signals promised transcendence. [183] The other half, led by the skeptical Dean Morrison, had called for total radio silence, demanding the station's destruction. [199] The community divided cleanly as a bone snapping—believers and deniers, neither side seeing the trap they were walking into. [217]

That was exactly what the tricksters wanted. [224] Conflict. [225] Polarization. [226] The psychic energy of a society tearing itself apart. [234]

Mira traced her finger along the charts, following the signal's origin point through three relay systems and a gravity lens near Proxima Centauri. [253] The entities had done this before—she'd found evidence in historical radio astronomy records, similar patterns preceding upheavals at research stations across the globe over the past century. [280] They weren't invaders. [283] They were farmers, cultivating human discord like a crop. [292]

But they'd made a mistake this time. [299] They'd chosen a station where someone actually listened. [307]

Her plan was cautiously hopeful at best, built on theoretical physics and desperation in equal measure. [321] The tricksters transmitted through subsonic frequencies because such waves bypassed conscious perception, embedding directly into the emotional centers of the brain. [341] Fear. [342] Certainty. [343] Righteous anger. [345] All amplified, all weaponized. [349]

What they hadn't anticipated was someone using those same frequencies against them. [360]

Mira's modified transmitter sat on the console, a Frankenstein creation of salvaged parts and stolen lab equipment. [375] She'd spent every night for two weeks building it, studying the signal's architecture, learning its grammar. [390] Now she would interfere—not by blocking the transmission, but by corrupting it, introducing dissonance into the carefully constructed emotional payload. [409]

The control room door rattled. [414] Fists pounded against the reinforced metal she'd welded shut yesterday. [424]

"Chen!" Dean Morrison's voice, hoarse with panic. [431] "Open this door! The board voted unanimously—the station gets demolished at midnight!" [443]

Mira checked her watch. [447] Forty-seven minutes. [449]

She ignored the shouting and powered up her transmitter. [458] The astronomical charts fluttered in the sudden electromagnetic field, and she felt the subsonic hum in her teeth, her bones, the liquid of her eyes. [482] The original signal screamed back at her, a sound that wasn't sound, a pressure that pushed against the walls of her skull. [503]

The tricksters knew. [506] They were paying attention now. [511]

Good. [512]

Mira began broadcasting her counter-frequency, modulating it through the patterns she'd decoded from the charts. [526] Instead of fear, she transmitted uncertainty. [532] Instead of righteousness, she sent curiosity. [538] Complex emotions, ones that resisted easy manipulation, ones that made people pause and think rather than march and burn. [555]

The pounding on the door stopped. [561]

Outside, through the static of her headphones, she heard the procession faltering. [572] Voices raised in confusion rather than fervor. [579] Someone was asking questions instead of chanting. [586]

The signal from Sagittarius A stuttered, its mathematical precision fracturing into noise. [597] Mira felt something vast and ancient recoil from her transmission, offended by her audacity, perhaps even afraid. [613]

The tricksters would return eventually. [618] They always did, patient as starlight. [624] But tonight, at least, the harvest was spoiled. [632]

Mira leaned back in her chair, watching the signal decay on her oscilloscope, her reflection ghosting across the screen like something not quite earthbound. [654] The community would need time to heal, to understand how close they'd come to destroying themselves over voices that weren't even real. [676]

She pulled out fresh astronomical charts and began scanning for the next frequency, the next manipulation, the next battle in a war nobody else knew was being fought. [700]

The door finally burst open at 11:58, but by then it didn't matter. [714] The transmitter had done its work, and the silence that followed was the most human sound Mira had ever heard. [733]
