The birch bark scroll crackled in Vera's hands as she unrolled it across the ranger cabin's rough-hewn table, its surface covered in her own handwriting from dreams she couldn't remember dreaming. [35]

Three weeks had passed since she'd stumbled upon her own grave in the meadow below, the headstone weathered by decades that hadn't happened yet. [58]

She'd been chronicling lucid dreams for eleven years, recording the architecture of her sleeping mind with the precision of a cartographer mapping shifting continents. [80] But the discovery of that granite marker—her name, her birth date, a death date forty years hence—had fractured something in her temporal understanding. [101]

Now the dreams bled backward and forward without warning. [110]

She traced her finger along the bark's surface, reading an entry dated three years ago, or perhaps three years from now—the handwriting was hers but steadier, more assured. [137] The cabin groaned against the mountain wind as she read words describing this exact moment: a woman at a table, lost between versions of herself. [161]

Feral nostalgia, that's what she'd named it in her research notes. [173] The savage, untamed longing not for a specific past but for the wild sensation of having once been whole and present. [195] She'd documented it in hundreds of dreamers before recognizing it in herself. [208]

The scroll described a dream where she could soar above the peaks, arms spread wide, the valley floor a quilt of evergreen and stone. [232] She remembered that flight—or would remember it—the cold air rushing past, her body weightless and certain. [250] Reading about it now, she felt something sharp twist beneath her ribs. [262]

Jealousy. [263]

She was jealous of the version of herself who had written these words. [276] That Vera had possessed the clarity to dream of flight without questioning whether the ground below was past or future. [295] She envied the Vera of last month who hadn't yet seen her own ending carved in stone, who could sleep without waking into days that might have already happened. [324]

The chronicler's curse, she thought with jaded wonder. [333] You spend so long documenting the extraordinary that you forget you're allowed to simply live it. [350]

She pulled another scroll from the stack, this one older, the bark brittle and dark. [366] Her handwriting here was almost unrecognizable—younger, messier, full of exclamation points and sprawling margins. [381] Nineteen-year-old Vera had dreamed of this cabin before she'd ever seen it, had sketched its layout with eerie accuracy. [400]

The dreams had always known. [405]

She'd come to this mountain ranger station three months ago to distill chaos into narrative, to impose order on the temporal chaos her sleeping mind produced. [429] The isolation was supposed to help. [435] Instead, she'd found her grave and lost her grip on sequence entirely. [447]

Now she understood that the chaos was the narrative. [456]

Vera stood and moved to the cabin's window, where dawn was either beginning or ending—she'd stopped trusting the evidence of light. [476] Below, the meadow held her headstone like a secret. [486] Above, the peaks promised the kind of flight she'd once taken for granted in dreams. [501]

She picked up her pen and a fresh piece of bark, stripped yesterday from the birch behind the cabin. [520] The writing came slowly at first, then faster, as if her hand remembered a rhythm her conscious mind had forgotten. [540]

She wrote about the jealousy, how strange it was to envy yourself, to look at your own memories like a stranger's treasures. [562] She wrote about soaring, about the precise angle of morning light through mountain air, about the specific loneliness of knowing your own ending before you've finished your beginning. [590]

The dream chronicle had always been her attempt to catch water in a net. [604] But maybe the point wasn't catching anything. [612] Maybe it was the reaching. [616]

She finished the entry and rolled the scroll, adding it to the stack of past futures and future pasts. [635] Tomorrow she would climb to the ridge and try to remember how her dream-self had felt, arms spread against the wind. [657]

The grave would still be there when she returned. [666] It would always be there, patient as stone, marking an ending she was finally ready to stop fearing and start writing toward. [687]

Vera smiled, tasting something like wonder beneath the jade of her exhaustion. [699] The chaos wasn't disorder. [703] It was simply a story told out of sequence, waiting for a chronicler patient enough to listen from every direction at once. [723]

Outside, the mountain wind carried the scent of birch and snow, smelling exactly like a memory she hadn't made yet. [742]
