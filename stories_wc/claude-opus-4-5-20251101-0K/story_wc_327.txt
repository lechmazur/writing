The storyteller traced the copper veins that wound beneath her skin, watching them pulse with each word she spoke into the canyon. [23] She had been born with these metallic threads running through her flesh, a gift or a curse depending on who told the tale. [46] Now, standing at the entrance to the towers of bone, she understood their purpose for the first time. [62]

The towers rose like frozen screams from the canyon floor, ancient vertebrae stacked upon ribs, skulls crowning the highest spires. [79] This was where the language of her people had come to die, its last speakers having built these monuments from their own bodies centuries ago. [102] She was the final inheritor of their tongue, and she felt it withering inside her throat with each passing season. [121]

In her palm sat the flawed diamond, its interior fractured by a dark vein that collectors called the Tongue-Taker's Flaw. [138] Rumored to be cursed, it had silenced every owner who tried to possess it, stealing their voices one syllable at a time. [159] But she had not come to possess it. [167] She had come to use it. [173]

"The texture of grief feels like sand caught in honey," she said quietly, her voice articulate and precise despite the trembling in her hands. [194] The copper veins beneath her skin hummed with recognition. [203] She had spent her life translating texture into sound, finding the words that made people feel silk or thorns or the weight of wet wool against their shoulders. [230] It was why her stories lingered in memory long after the telling. [242]

But there were no words left for what she needed to say. [253] The dying language held sounds that her adopted tongue could never recreate, consonants that required the shape of the bone towers to resonate properly. [276] Without them, the final stories of her ancestors would be lost forever. [288]

Above her, a flock of white birds burst from one of the skull-crowned towers. [301] They wheeled and scattered, then reformed in patterns that seemed almost deliberate. [313] She watched them divide and merge, their wings catching the eternal echoes that bounced through the canyon. [328] The echoes never stopped here. [333] Words spoken a hundred years ago still traveled through this tunnel of echoes, growing fainter but never truly fading. [351]

She raised the flawed diamond and studied the birds through its fractured heart. [364] The patterns shifted, and suddenly she understood. [371] The birds were living algorithms, their flight paths describing the shapes of forgotten phonemes. [384] Each formation was a letter in the dying language, preserved not in writing but in movement. [399]

To harness their knowledge, she would need to speak through them. [410]

She pressed the diamond against her throat, feeling its cold curse seep toward her voice. [424] But the copper veins intercepted it, channeling the silencing power into something new. [436] Instead of stealing her words, the diamond began to translate her intentions into frequencies only the birds could hear. [453]

She thought of rough bark, of the texture of her grandmother's hands, of the grit that settled in the creases of old linen. [474] The copper beneath her skin sang these textures as sound, and the birds responded. [488] They swooped into formations she recognized from her earliest memories, shapes her mother had drawn in the air while telling stories she could no longer understand. [511]

Through the patterns in the flock of birds in flight, the forgotten words began to return. [526]

She spoke them as they came, her quietly articulate voice finding rhythms it had never known before. [542] The bone towers caught her sounds and multiplied them, sending them down the tunnel of echoes to join the voices of her ancestors. [565] The flawed diamond cracked further with each word, its dark vein spreading like roots through crystal. [581]

By the time she finished, the diamond had shattered completely, its curse dispersed among a thousand echoes. [597] The birds settled on the towers, folding their wings into rest. [608] She stood in silence, feeling the weight of a complete language resting in her copper-threaded blood. [624]

The death of the language had taken three centuries. [633] Its resurrection had taken one afternoon. [639] But the true work lay ahead, translating each recovered texture into sounds that new tongues could learn, building bridges between what was lost and what might yet be saved. [669]

She walked deeper into the canyon, following the echoes of her own voice as they spiraled toward the oldest towers, where the first stories still waited to be heard again. [698]
