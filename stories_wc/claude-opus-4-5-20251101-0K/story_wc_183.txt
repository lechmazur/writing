The carnival ship drifted through fog so thick it seemed to swallow time itself, and Mira pressed the emerald swatch card against her palm until its edges left crescents in her skin. [32]

She had found her twin three days ago, though "found" was the wrong word. [45] Discovered, perhaps—the way one discovers that the reflection in a mirror has been moving independently all along. [62] Her sister Vera existed in the spaces between Mira's memories, appearing only when the fog rolled thickest across the abandoned deck, her form assembled from narrative threads that Mira had spent twenty years trying to forget. [95]

"You keep coming back to this spot," Vera said, materializing beside the rusted carousel. [110] Her voice carried the quality of an echo that preceded its source. [122]

"The garden of forgotten names," Mira replied, not looking up. [132] "Mother said it was real. [137] That if we found it, we could recapture what we lost." [148]

The emerald swatch card had been their mother's—one of hundreds she'd collected during her years as the ship's fortune teller, each color corresponding to a different fate she'd woven for paying customers. [180] Emerald meant renewal, rebirth, the verdant possibility of starting over. [190] Mira had stolen it from her mother's cabin the night before the ship was abandoned, before the passengers fled and left only ghosts and rust behind. [214]

Vera reached for the card, and Mira watched her sister's fingers pass through it like smoke through a keyhole. [232] "You're still trying to make me solid," Vera observed. [242] "Still trying to believe I was real." [249]

"You were real." [252] Mira's voice cracked on the word. [258] "You are real." [261]

But as memories alter, so too does truth. [269] Mira had been the chimera twin discoverer—the one who'd found, at age seven, that she carried traces of a sister who had never been born, absorbed in the womb, reduced to cells that whispered in her blood. [305] The doctors called it vanishing twin syndrome. [312] Her mother, blissfully aberrant in her grief, had called it a visitation. [323]

"She's still with you," Mother had insisted, painting stories across the carnival ship's walls as it sailed through foggy bays and stranger waters. [345] "You just have to find her through the narrative threads—through the stories we tell ourselves to survive." [362]

So Mira had learned to construct Vera from possibility, from longing, from the unkindled solace of imagining she had never been alone. [382]

Now the ship drifted without engine or anchor, trapped in a bay that appeared on no charts. [399] The fog created a prison of infinite visibility—she could see nothing, yet felt seen by everything. [416] This was trapped freedom: the ability to go anywhere while going nowhere, to speak with a sister who could not truly answer. [436]

"The garden exists," Vera said, and her form flickered like a film reel catching. [450] "But you have to stop trying to recapture me. [459] The forgotten names aren't names at all—they're the words we never spoke because we were afraid they'd make our ghosts too real." [481]

Mira turned the emerald swatch card over. [488] On its back, in their mother's cramped handwriting: For my chimera daughters, when you finally meet. [502]

"She knew," Mira breathed. [506]

"She always knew." [509] Vera's edges softened, becoming less like memory and more like mist. [521] "The garden is wherever you let me go. [529] Plant my name among the forgotten ones. [536] Stop building me from what you wish had been." [545]

The fog thinned for the first time in days, revealing a shoreline Mira didn't recognize—green and wild, tangled with flowers that seemed to be growing even as she watched. [574] The abandoned carnival ship groaned as if releasing a held breath. [585]

Mira walked to the railing and let the emerald swatch card fall. [597] It caught an updraft, spinning once, twice, before disappearing into the garden below. [611]

"Vera," she said aloud—not to the ghost beside her, but to the cells within her, the sister she had carried for thirty years. [635] "Thank you for staying." [639]

When she turned, Vera was gone, but Mira felt lighter, more whole, as if the weight of an imaginary twin had transformed into something she could finally hold: the blissfully aberrant knowledge that loneliness and love are sometimes the same thing, carried differently. [681]

The ship drifted on, but now the fog felt less like a cage and more like a cradle—unkindled solace finally catching flame. [703]

Mira sat on the carousel's painted horse and watched the garden of forgotten names grow wild and beautiful beneath a sun she could almost see. [728]

She would reach that shore eventually. [734] Until then, she practiced speaking to the empty air, not to summon ghosts, but to honor them—threading new narratives from old grief, finding in trapped freedom the most peculiar kind of peace. [764]
