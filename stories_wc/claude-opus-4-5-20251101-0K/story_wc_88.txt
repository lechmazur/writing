The underground lake glowed with a cold blue light that reminded Marcus of the operating theater where they had scraped his memories clean. [25] Three weeks after the procedure, and he still couldn't remember his own crimes, only the weight of them pressing against his chest like a phantom limb. [50]

He had come here following breadcrumbs hidden in newspaper articles—phrases that didn't quite fit, first letters that spelled coordinates when you knew how to look. [73] Someone wanted him to find this place. [80] Someone who knew what he had been before the wipe. [90]

The bioluminescent algae painted everything in shades of impossible blue, delicately robust in their survival down here where nothing should grow. [109] Marcus understood that contradiction now. [114] The procedure had been meant to give him a clean slate, but the slate kept showing through, faint marks of the man who had done terrible things to people who trusted him. [143]

He found the baseball resting on a flat stone at the water's edge, its leather surface cracked but the signature still legible: "To Marcus—make better choices this time. —J.L., 2089." [172]

The date stopped him cold. [177] That was sixty years from now. [183]

"You found it." [186] The voice came from the shadows where the lake's light couldn't reach. [197] A woman emerged, her face carrying the jaded wonder of someone who had seen too many miracles to be impressed but couldn't quite stop looking. [220] "I wasn't sure you'd follow the clues." [228]

"Who are you?" [231]

"Someone who knew you before." [236] She sat on a stone across from him, the blue light making her look like a ghost. [252] "My name is Elena. [256] You killed my brother." [260]

Marcus felt the phantom weight press harder. [267] "I don't remember—" [270]

"I know." [272] Her voice held no anger, only exhaustion. [279] "That's why I brought you here. [285] The procedure was supposed to give society a reformed citizen. [294] But it just gave us a man who doesn't know why he should feel sorry." [308]

She gestured at the baseball. [313] "That's real. [316] Someone from the future found a way to send objects back. [326] They've been appearing for decades, always with instructions. [334] This one came with a message for me: 'Help him remember feeling, not facts.'" [348]

"Why would you help me?" [353] The question scraped against his throat. [360]

"Because my brother wouldn't want me to spend my life hating a stranger." [373] Elena pulled a folded newspaper from her jacket. [381] "You taught yourself to read between the lines when you were a con artist, using coded messages to run your schemes. [401] The procedure couldn't erase skills, only memories. [408] So I used your own methods to bring you here, to the one place where you might understand." [425]

She pointed at the water. [430] "This lake is a labyrinth. [435] There are seven tunnels leading out, each one a choice. [445] One leads to the surface. [450] The others loop back or dead-end. [457] You have to feel your way through—the algae respond to emotional states, brighten when you're being honest with yourself." [475]

"And if I choose wrong?" [480]

"You keep trying until you get it right or give up." [491] Elena stood. [493] "That's what redemption is. [498] Not one perfect choice, but a thousand imperfect ones, each one teaching you something about who you want to become." [517]

Marcus looked at the baseball, at the impossible date, at the promise that somewhere in the future he had become someone worth sending messages to. [540] The journey ahead terrified him—not the physical maze, but the internal one he'd have to navigate simultaneously. [556]

"Why kindle empathy in someone like me?" [562] He asked because he needed to understand, needed to feel something other than this terrible numbness. [576]

"Because empathy isn't a reward for good people. [584] It's a tool for making people better." [591] Elena's jaded wonder softened into something almost like hope. [600] "My brother believed that. [604] You took that from me when you took him. [612] Now I'm taking it back by proving him right." [621]

She disappeared into one of the tunnels, leaving him alone with the glowing water and the weight of choices he couldn't remember making. [642]

Marcus gripped the baseball, feeling the stitches under his fingers, and waded into the lake. [657] The water was cold, the light strange and shifting around him. [668] Ahead, seven tunnels waited like questions he didn't know how to answer yet. [681]

But the algae around his feet began to brighten, responding to something true stirring in his hollow chest. [697]

He chose a tunnel and started walking, reading his own heart the way he once read newspapers, searching for meaning in the spaces between what was written and what was meant. [728]
