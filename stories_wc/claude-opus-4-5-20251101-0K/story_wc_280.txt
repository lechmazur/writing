The applause had faded three hundred years ago, but Madeline still heard it in colors—great swells of crimson and gold that painted the air whenever she manifested. [29]

She drifted through the hedge maze long after the estate's garden tours ended, when the last visitors had shuffled away and twilight claimed the grounds. [54] This was her hour, the liminal space after the business closes, when reality grew thin enough for a ghost to taste the living world again. [77]

The mystic orchard garden concealed within the maze's heart had once been a theater. [90] Three centuries prior, traveling performers had staged their comedies and tragedies among the apple trees, their voices carrying through leaves that trembled like eager audiences. [112] Madeline had been their star, a leading lady whose synesthetically blessed senses transformed every word spoken near her into cascading hues and textures. [132] She had tasted sonnets on her tongue like honey, felt laughter as velvet against her skin. [147]

Now she was merely an encore-seeking stage ghost, trapped in loops of memory, forever waiting for a curtain call that would never come. [168]

But tonight, something shifted. [172]

A young woman sat beneath the oldest apple tree, her shoulders curved inward like parentheses around grief. [188] Madeline recognized that posture—she had seen it in mirrors during her mortal years, during the dark season when she had nearly walked away from the stage forever. [213]

The woman held something small, turning it over in trembling fingers: a hand-painted tarot coin, its face showing a figure balanced between towers that spiraled in impossible directions. [238] The Crossroads, Madeline knew. [243] The choice that comes when all paths seem equally hopeless. [253]

Despair radiated from the woman in deep indigo waves that Madeline could see pooling at her feet. [269]

The ghost descended, drawn by purpose older than memory. [279] To lure possibility from the brink of despair—this had been her gift in life, hadn't it? [295] To show audiences that tragedy could transform, that endings could become beginnings? [306]

Madeline reached for the fractured timeline that spiraled around the orchard like a tangle of silver threads. [321] She had learned, in her centuries of haunting, that time here did not flow in a single direction. [339] The maze had been built on sacred ground, and the years had twisted back upon themselves, creating echoes and overlaps where past and present could intertwine. [363]

By producing echoes, she began to work her strange magic. [373]

The woman gasped as voices drifted through the apple trees—not ghostly whispers, but full, rich sounds from another age. [391] Madeline pulled a scene from 1721: herself, young and despairing, sitting in this very spot before her greatest performance. [410]

"I cannot go on," the echo of living Madeline said to a figure beside her—Thomas, the playwright who had believed in her when she could not believe in herself. [437]

"Then don't go on as you were," Thomas replied, his words tasting of copper and pine. [453] "Go on as who you're becoming." [459]

The present-day woman watched, transfixed, as ghost-Madeline wove another thread into the scene—1892, a grieving widow finding solace in the orchard. [478] Then 1956, a failed artist discovering unexpected purpose among the same ancient trees. [491] Timeline after timeline fractured and reformed, each echo showing someone at their lowest moment, each showing the turn toward light. [510]

The scenes began to intertwine, voices overlapping in harmonies that painted the air in colors the woman couldn't see but somehow felt. [531] Madeline watched her grip on the tarot coin loosen, watched her shoulders straighten almost imperceptibly. [546]

Rising nostalgia flooded the orchard—not Madeline's alone, but accumulated from every soul who had ever found hope in this hidden place. [567] The emotion built like the crescendo of a symphony, like the moment before an audience rises to its feet. [586]

"The coin shows crossroads," Madeline whispered, her voice carrying on wavelengths just beyond mortal hearing. [601] "Not endings. Never endings." [605]

The woman looked up sharply, perhaps sensing something, perhaps simply caught by the evening breeze. [619] She lifted the coin to the fading light, studying its painted figure anew. [632]

When she finally stood and walked away through the maze, her steps carried a rhythm that Madeline heard in pale green and silver—the colors of growing things, of possibility unfurling. [660]

The ghost remained beneath the apple tree as stars emerged, waiting. [672] Tomorrow night, after the tours ended, she would return to this stage. [685] There would be other visitors lost in the maze, other souls carrying their crossroads coins. [699]

And Madeline would give them what she had always given her audiences: a performance that made them believe in encores. [717]

The applause would never return. [722]

But this, she decided, was close enough. [729]
