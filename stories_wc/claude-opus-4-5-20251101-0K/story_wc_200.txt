The lost soul collector descended into Echo Gorge as the first pale light crept over the eastern ridge, illuminating nothing so much as her own uncertainty. [28] For three centuries, Maren had gathered the wandering dead, guiding them toward whatever peace awaited beyond the veil, but somewhere in those endless years, she had misplaced herself. [56] Her own name felt borrowed. [61] Her purpose, once crystalline, had grown opaque as river fog. [71]

She carried little: a worn leather satchel, a silver bell that no longer rang true, and a crocodile's tooth on a cord around her neck. [95] The tooth had belonged to her teacher, old Vasilis, who had plucked it from a beast in the Nile delta before Maren was born. [118] He claimed it held the memory of ancient laughter, of joy so pure it could cut through any darkness. [136] She had never believed him until he died laughing, his final breath a wheeze of genuine delight. [152]

Now she pursued something she barely understood, drawn to this gorge by whispers that echoed through the realm of the dead. [172] They spoke of a harp hidden in the canyon's depths, an instrument so badly misaligned that its notes bent reality itself, creating spaces where the living and dead could speak truths impossible anywhere else. [208] Spectral confessions, they called them, words that could only exist in distortion. [221]

Maren was modestly fearless, which meant she felt every tremor of apprehension but refused to let it stop her. [240] Fear was familiar, an old companion she had learned to walk alongside rather than flee. [256] The gorge swallowed her footsteps, then threw them back as ghostly repetitions. [268] Each echo carried fragments of voices, some ancient, some achingly recent. [279]

She found the harp at the canyon's heart, where the walls narrowed to a throat of striated stone. [296] It stood taller than she was, its frame carved from bone-white wood, its strings hanging slack and crooked. [314] The instrument looked abandoned, yet when she approached, it shuddered as if recognizing her. [328]

Maren touched a string. [332] The note that emerged was wrong, beautifully wrong, sliding between pitches like water finding cracks in stone. [349] The air around her shimmered, and suddenly she was not alone. [361]

Spirits materialized, drawn by the distorted music, their forms translucent in the hidden sunrise. [375] They were the souls she had collected and released over centuries, hundreds of them, thousands perhaps, and they carried something she had never noticed before: gratitude tangled with grief, sorrow wrapped around unexpected joy. [410]

One spirit stepped forward, a child who had drowned in a winter river two hundred years ago. [428] Through the harp's warped resonance, the girl spoke words that should have been impossible. [442] "You hummed while you carried me," she said. [451] "I was so scared, but you hummed, and it made me laugh. [463] I crossed over laughing." [468]

Another spirit, an old soldier with hollow eyes, added his voice. [479] "You told me a terrible joke about a three-legged horse. [490] I had not laughed in forty years of war. [499] You gave that back to me." [505]

The confessions poured through the misaligned harp, each distorted note releasing another memory Maren had forgotten. [520] She had been healing them not just by guiding their passage but by weaving laughter into their final moments, offering levity as a bridge between terror and peace. [549] She had done this instinctively, never recognizing it as purpose. [560]

Tears streamed down her face, luminous in the growing light. [571] The ache she had carried for so long began to shift, transforming from weight into warmth. [586] She was not lost. [590] She had simply been looking in the wrong direction, searching for meaning in the destination when it had always lived in the journey. [612]

Maren gripped the crocodile's tooth, finally understanding Vasilis's last lesson. [623] Joy was not the absence of sorrow but its companion, the medicine that made grief survivable. [639] Her work was not merely collection but connection, not just passage but presence. [652]

She struck the harp again, and this time she laughed, a sound raw and real that echoed through the gorge and back through centuries. [676] The spirits laughed with her, their spectral voices harmonizing with the crooked music. [690] In that hush of hidden sunrise, surrounded by the dead she had saved without knowing it, Maren found herself at last. [712]

She was a healer. [716] She had always been. [720] And there were more souls waiting, more laughter to offer against the dark. [734]

She climbed out of Echo Gorge as dawn broke fully, the crocodile's tooth warm against her chest, her purpose restored. [754] The ache remained, but now it glowed. [762]
