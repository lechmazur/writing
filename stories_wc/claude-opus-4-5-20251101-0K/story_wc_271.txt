The arboretum had outlived the lighthouse keeper by seventeen years, though his ghost still wandered through Mariam's mornings in small ways: the rusted watering can she found half-buried near the sequoias, the initials carved into the potting shed's doorframe. [47]

She came here after the wedding that ended in fire from a cloudless sky. [61]

Now she tended the cliffside gardens where rare species clung to existence above the churning Pacific, her hands learning the quiet talent of coaxing life from salt-blasted soil. [89] The other groundskeepers called her gifted, though she never spoke of how she'd learned patience—in hospital beds, in sleepless nights, in the slow work of rebuilding a nervous system that had learned to freeze at the sound of aircraft overhead. [126]

This morning, fog rolled through the cypress grove as Mariam knelt beside a row of endangered orchids. [143] Her therapist had taught her to track her body's signals through somatic markers: the tightening of her shoulders that preceded panic, the hollow sensation in her chest that meant grief was surfacing, the strange warmth behind her eyes that sometimes preceded memory. [179] She felt that warmth now and paused, letting it move through her rather than fighting it. [195]

In her pocket, the crumpled photograph waited like a patient wound. [206]

She'd carried it for four years—her cousin Fatima laughing in her wedding dress, henna still fresh on her palms, face turned toward a future that would last exactly forty-three more minutes. [235] The photograph had been in Mariam's bag when the missile struck. [246] She'd been outside, walking back from a shop with extra flowers for the table arrangements. [261]

The concussion had thrown her into a stone wall. [270] She'd woken to silence and smoke and the understanding that everything she'd known had been reorganized into categories of before and after. [291]

A red-tailed hawk circled overhead, and Mariam's body responded before her mind could intervene: muscles locking, breath catching, that ancient freeze response claiming her nervous system like a hostile country. [321] She placed one hand flat against the cool earth, feeling the texture of soil, the tiny roots threading through it. [340] She counted the somatic markers—racing pulse, contracted diaphragm, tunnel vision—and named them without judgment, the way her body named danger without asking permission. [362]

Slowly, like tide water receding, the panic ebbed. [370]

The hawk was just a hawk. [376] The sky held only weather. [381]

She extracted the photograph and studied it, as she did most mornings, searching for what she called a pearl of stillness within the storm of what it represented. [407] Today she found it in Fatima's earrings—small gold crescents that had belonged to their grandmother, that Mariam now wore against her own skin. [430] The dead lived in the living. [436] This was not comfort exactly, but it was true, and Mariam had learned to anchor optimism in realism rather than false hope. [456]

She believed the world could grow gentler. [463] She also believed it might not. [469] Both truths existed simultaneously, like the arboretum itself—cultivated beauty perched above wild, indifferent ocean. [482]

The lighthouse stood dark now, automated systems having replaced human witness, but Mariam sometimes imagined the last keeper standing where she stood, watching the same horizon, wondering the same questions about what purpose meant when the world kept turning regardless of human presence. [522]

She tucked the photograph away and returned to the orchids. [532]

Quietly talented, the head botanist had written in her evaluation. [542] Shows remarkable intuition for plant stress signals. [549] Mariam had almost laughed at that—of course she recognized stress signals. [560] She'd learned to read them in herself the way others read weather, and the translation to plants seemed natural. [577] Both she and the orchids were survivors of hostile environments. [587] Both required specific conditions to bloom. [593]

By noon, she'd transplanted three specimens and repaired a section of protective netting that the wind had torn loose. [611] Her shoulders ached pleasantly. [615] Her mind was quiet. [619]

The fog lifted, revealing the coastline in sharp detail: black rocks, white foam, the endless gray-green water stretching toward horizons she'd never see. [640] Somewhere across that water, the country of her birth continued existing without her, continued making weddings and funerals and ordinary Tuesdays. [659]

Mariam breathed in salt air and released it slowly, feeling her feet against solid ground, her heartbeat steady and present. [678]

The pearl of stillness lived in moments like this—not the absence of pain, but the presence of something larger that contained pain without being consumed by it. [703]

She picked up her tools and walked toward the greenhouse, where seedlings waited in their careful rows, each one a small vote for the future. [728]

Tomorrow she would return to the orchids. [735]

Tomorrow the sky might hold anything. [741]

But today, the arboretum held her, and that was enough. [751]
