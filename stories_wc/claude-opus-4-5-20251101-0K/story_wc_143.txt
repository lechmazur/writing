The crater inspector climbed the final ridge as Earth's blue crescent hung low on the lunar horizon. [17] Maria Chen had spent eleven years cataloging impact sites across the Sea of Tranquility, but tonight's assignment carried a weight that pressed against her chest like decompression sickness. [44] She was here to photograph the last untouched Apollo footprint before the mining consortium's dozers arrived at dawn. [61]

Her boots crunched against regolith that had remained undisturbed for over a century. [74] The space age had promised humanity the stars, but it had also taught them to consume everything they touched. [93] Now, in 2089, the moon was real estate, and history was just another obstacle to profitable extraction. [111]

Maria adjusted her helmet camera and knelt beside the preserved bootprint, her purposefully curious nature driving her to examine every ridge and depression in the ancient impression. [138] Buzz Aldrin had stood here in 1969, she thought, and looked up at that same Earth. [154] The dawning hush of the lunar morning crept across the moonlit summit, that peculiar silence before the sun's harsh light would erase the soft shadows that made the footprint visible. [184]

She had maybe three hours before the corporate crews arrived with their equipment and their schedules. [200] Three hours to document what would soon become a graded parking area for helium-3 extractors. [215]

From her belt pouch, Maria retrieved a small vial containing a single grain of sand from an antique hourglass. [233] It had belonged to her grandfather, who had worked as a nightwatch at the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum for forty years. [256] When he died, they'd scattered his ashes near the Wright Flyer, but Maria had kept this one grain from his hourglass, the timekeeper that had measured his lonely shifts guarding humanity's aerospace heritage. [291]

She pressed the grain into the regolith beside the footprint, a private memorial that the corporation would unknowingly destroy. [310] Let something of a man who loved this history rest here with it. [324]

Her radio crackled with a transmission from Station Armstrong, sixteen kilometers east. [336] "Inspector Chen, consortium transports are launching early. You have ninety minutes." [347]

Maria's jaw tightened. [350] She would outlast their schedules, their bureaucratic indifference, their appetite for erasing the past. [363] She had prepared for this possibility. [369]

From her equipment case, she withdrew a series of chemical packets, each one calibrated to react at precise intervals. [388] The technique was old, something she'd learned from her grandfather's stories about cold war espionage: using chemical reactions for timed messages. [409] When exposed to lunar vacuum and solar radiation, each packet would release a different colored phosphorescent compound at staggered intervals over the coming weeks. [433]

She placed them in a careful pattern around the footprint zone, buried just beneath the surface. [450] Even after the dozers came, the chemicals would bloom upward through disturbed soil, creating temporary monuments that would appear in orbital surveys. [473] The messages were simple coordinates and dates, breadcrumbs for historians who might someday care. [488]

The sun's first rays touched the distant crater rim. [498] Maria worked faster, photographing from every angle, her purposefully curious eye catching details that decades of remote scanning had missed: a tiny fragment of gold foil, a scuff mark where an astronaut had stumbled, the subtle discoloration of soil touched by human presence. [543]

Dawnlit melancholy settled over her as she finished. [551] She understood that she was not really preserving anything. [561] The footprint would vanish, her photographs would be archived in some database that nobody would access, and her chemical messages would fade within months. [585] Everything she loved about her work, the detective story of reading impacts and pressures and ancient violence in stone, was being rendered obsolete by commerce. [610]

But she would document anyway. [615] She would witness. [618]

Her grandfather had once told her that the nightwatch's job was never to stop the dawn from coming. [636] It was simply to be awake when no one else was, to hold vigil over precious things during their darkest hours. [658]

Maria took one final photograph as golden light spilled across the summit, transforming the footprint's shadows into mere suggestions. [678] In ninety minutes, the dozers would arrive. [686] In ninety years, perhaps no one would remember this place had mattered. [699]

She pressed her gloved hand against the regolith beside the ancient bootprint, adding her own mark to the story. [718]

Then she stood, gathered her equipment, and began the long walk back to base, leaving the moonlit summit to its final dawn. [742]
