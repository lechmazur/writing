The xenobiology research station hung suspended in the atmosphere of Kepler-442b, its docking arms stretched like the legs of a sleeping spider. [24] Mira Chen wiped grease from her hands and watched the twilight settle over the gas giant's cloud layers, painting everything in shades of amber and violet. [47] As the station's only sky mechanic, she maintained the delicate balance of engines and stabilizers that kept three hundred researchers alive. [67] But tonight, her work served a different purpose entirely. [76]

The creatures they called cloudweavers had returned to their roosts along the station's outer hull, their massive translucent wings folding into silence. [96] Within the hush of beating wings at rest, Mira finally had her window. [109] She pulled the lever that opened the auxiliary observation deck, feeling the mechanically warm vibration of the station's systems humming through her bones. [130]

Dr. Vasquez had laughed when she first proposed her theory. [140] Time doesn't move sideways, he'd said. [147] That's not how causality works. [152] But Mira had spent eighteen years fixing machines in the sky, watching patterns that earthbound physicists never saw. [169] She understood how things connected, how systems influenced each other in ways that defied linear explanation. [184]

The magnetic nexus formed at twilight, every twilight, when the planet's three moons aligned and the station's position created a perfect intersection of electromagnetic fields. [208] Through holographic principles, Mira had mapped these intersections, projecting them as shimmering lattices in her makeshift laboratory. [225] The patterns weren't random. [229] They repeated, but not in sequence. [235] They echoed sideways through time, effects preceding causes, memories existing before the events that created them. [250]

Tonight, she would prove it. [255]

Mira positioned her modified resonance scanner at the center of the observation deck, adjusting the calibration with the patient precision of someone who had realigned countless thruster arrays. [281] The cloudweavers stirred slightly in their sleep, their bioluminescent markings pulsing in slow rhythms that matched the station's heartbeat. [300] She had always felt more kinship with machines and alien creatures than with her own kind. [315] Both operated on principles that made sense once you learned their language. [327]

The holographic display flickered to life, projecting the magnetic field lines as they converged toward the nexus point. [345] Mira watched the data stream, her breath visible in the cold deck air despite the warmth radiating from the scanner's core. [366] That contradiction had always defined her life here. [374] Icy warmth, the way space stations balanced freezing vacuum against the fever of contained power. [388]

There. [389] The anomaly appeared exactly as her calculations predicted. [397] A ripple in the magnetic field, propagating not forward or backward, but perpendicular to the timeline itself. [413] The scanner recorded a signal that would arrive at its source three hours before transmission. [428] Effect before cause. [431] Time moving sideways. [434]

Mira's hands trembled as she saved the data. [442] This wasn't the explosive revelation the holovids promised for scientific breakthroughs. [453] It was quieter, a subdued awakening that settled over her like dawn light through cloud cover. [467] She had spent so long trying to prove something she already felt in her bones. [482]

The cloudweavers began to stir, their wings unfolding with whispered grace as they sensed the twilight's end. [498] Mira watched them launch into the amber sky, their movements impossibly synchronized despite having no visible means of communication. [516] She understood now. [519] They had always known what she had struggled to prove. [529] Time wasn't a river. [533] It was an ocean, and everything happened in all directions at once. [545]

She pulled the lever to seal the observation deck, the mechanically warm shudder of the closing doors mixing with the distant calls of departing creatures. [568] Tomorrow, she would present her findings to Dr. Vasquez. [578] He would demand verification, peer review, years of confirmation studies. [588] That was fine. [591] The proof existed now, recorded in the intersection of alien biology and electromagnetic fields and the patient work of an obliging sky mechanic who fixed things for a living. [617]

The station drifted through the purple dusk, carrying its cargo of sleeping researchers and one woman who had glimpsed the true shape of time. [641] Mira returned to her quarters through corridors humming with the icy warmth she had come to love, the holographic data chip pressed against her heart. [666] Some awakenings arrived like thunderstorms. [672] Hers had come like the cloudweavers settling into rest, soft and certain and irreversible. [685]

She fell asleep to the rhythm of the station's engines, dreaming of sideways rivers and wings that knew tomorrow's wind before it blew. [708]
