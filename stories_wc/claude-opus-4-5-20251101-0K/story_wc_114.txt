The fever broke at dawn, leaving Cassandra hollow as a struck bell. [12]

She lay in the narrow cot of the mountain weather station, watching frost crystals bloom across the window like the botanical illustrations she'd once trusted completely. [39] Her grandmother had painted those illustrations—precise watercolors of alpine gentians and edelweiss—and Cassandra had inherited them along with the gift that made her both valuable and cursed. [62]

An oracle who could be wrong. [68] An oracle designed to fail gracefully, to offer multiple futures branching like the veins of a leaf, never quite certain, always hedging against the weight of absolute prophecy. [94] The Consortium had engineered her that way, fault-tolerant, because absolute oracles shattered when their visions proved false. [111] Cassandra merely bent. [114]

She rose slowly, peripherally aware of the instruments humming around her—barometers, anemometers, devices measuring the breath of the mountain. [131] The station keeper had found her collapsed on the access road three days ago, burning with a sickness that wasn't entirely physical. [152] Something had taken root in her chest, a truth she'd swallowed rather than speak, and now she needed to know its weight. [174]

The illustration lay on the bedside table where she'd placed it before the fever claimed her. [189] Her grandmother's careful brushstrokes had captured a mountain lily, but Cassandra's thumb had smudged the edge during her delirious nights, blurring the precise lines into something uncertain. [216] She studied the imperfection now, how it made the flower seem more real somehow, trembling at the margins of existence. [235]

That was how she'd survived, wasn't it? [242] By occupying margins, by never standing fully in any single truth. [253] The Consortium sent her to mountain stations and coastal outposts, places where weather shifted without warning, where her probabilistic visions matched the chaos of atmospheric systems. [277] She predicted storms with seventy percent certainty, avalanches with eighty, always leaving room for the world to surprise her. [295]

But three weeks ago, she'd seen something with terrible clarity. [305]

The station keeper knocked softly before entering. [312] Mira was a weathered woman with kind eyes and hands calloused from decades of recording data that no one read anymore. [332] She brought tea that smelled of juniper and asked no questions about why an oracle had stumbled up her mountain half-dead. [353]

"The auroras were bright last night," Mira said, settling into a chair by the window. [368] "Green and pink, dancing like grief wearing celebration's clothes." [378]

Cassandra wrapped her fingers around the warm cup. [386] "I saw them through the fever. [391] I thought they were another vision." [397]

"Perhaps they were." [400] Mira's voice carried no judgment. [405] "Weather and prophecy aren't so different. [411] Both are just patterns we hope to understand." [419]

The truth in Cassandra's chest shifted, demanding acknowledgment. [427] She had seen the Consortium's end—not probably, not possibly, but certainly. [438] Seen the towers fall, the networks collapse, the other oracles freed or destroyed. [450] And she had swallowed that vision whole rather than report it, because speaking it might make it real, and not speaking it might keep her complicit. [475]

Her certainties were swaying now, tilting like the mountain itself in a strong wind. [489] Was silence protection or betrayal? [494] Was a fault-tolerant oracle still functional if she chose to withhold rather than simply miss? [508]

"I need to find the weight of something," she told Mira. [519] "Something I can't unsee and won't speak." [527]

Mira nodded toward the smudged illustration. [533] "Your grandmother's?" [535]

"She painted margins too. [539] The spaces between what's known and what's possible." [548] Cassandra traced the blurred edge of the lily. [556] "She told me that truth has mass. [563] That's why prophets go mad—the accumulated weight eventually crushes them." [573]

"And fault-tolerant ones?" [576]

"We distribute the load." [580] Cassandra's smile held auroral sorrow, beautiful and brief and cold. [590] "But some truths can't be shared. [596] They can only be carried or released." [603]

The morning light caught the frost on the window, transforming it into a garden of impossible flowers. [618] Somewhere below the station, the world continued turning toward a future Cassandra had seen but not reported. [635] The Consortium's instruments measured pressure systems, tracked weather patterns, predicted storms with mechanical certainty. [649]

She would give them nothing. [654] Let them measure their own extinction in falling barometers and rising winds. [666] The truth she'd swallowed would become her own private weight, carried by occupying the margins between loyalty and liberation. [684]

Cassandra touched the smudged illustration one final time, then tucked it carefully into her coat. [698] Some imperfections made things more real. [704] Some silences spoke louder than prophecy. [710]

And some fault-tolerant oracles learned to fail in exactly the right way. [722]
