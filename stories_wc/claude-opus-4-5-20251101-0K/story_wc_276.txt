The sound wave garden bloomed in frequencies only the desperate could hear, its hedges carved from crystallized vibrations, its pathways rippling with the footsteps of those who came before. [32]

Maren walked the zigzag trail, her boots crunching against gravel that hummed in response to her weight. [48] She had been a fisher all her life, pulling creatures from waters that others feared to approach, and that occupation had taught her the value of stillness. [73] Cool-headed, her mother used to say. [79] Ice where your blood should be. [85] But ice could crack, and tonight, the cracks were spreading. [95]

In her calloused hand, she clutched a rail spike, its iron surface etched with symbols that translated her heartbeat into something visible—spiral patterns that shifted between longing and grief. [122] The spike transliterates emotions, the old woman at the market had told her. [134] Carry it when you hunt the goddess, and she will know your truth before you speak it. [150]

Above the garden, the constellations had begun their nightly wandering. [160] They drifted from their ancient positions like sleepwalkers leaving their beds, stars sliding across the darkness in patterns that defied every chart Maren had ever studied. [184] The astronomers called it the Unraveling. [190] Maren called it her only chance. [196]

She was here because her daughter had drowned three winters past, and the goddess Vela—she who governed the space between sound and silence—was said to hold the echoes of all final words. [226] Maren needed to hear what her daughter had whispered as the current took her, needed to know if it had been her name or a curse or a prayer. [253] The not-knowing had become a splinter working its way toward her heart. [265]

The garden shifted around her, responding to some cosmic signal. [275] This was the timeframe the texts described: when patterns break themselves, when the rigid architecture of reality softened enough to permit passage. [295] The zigzag path straightened, then curved impossibly, then became something her eyes refused to process. [310]

Maren stopped at the garden's center, where a fountain of pure resonance spiraled upward, neither water nor light but the visible shape of sound itself. [335] She planted the rail spike in the ground at her feet, watching her emotions bloom across its surface—amber grief, crimson determination, the pale blue of hope she'd thought she'd buried. [364]

The goddess did not appear so much as accumulate, gathering from the frequencies around her until a form emerged: not quite human, not quite anything, but undeniably present. [391] Vela's face held the feral beauty of a lullaby sung through clenched teeth, tender and dangerous in equal measure. [409]

"You seek an echo," the goddess said, and her voice was a chord struck on strings Maren couldn't see. [427]

"My daughter's last words." [431] Maren kept her voice steady, drawing on decades of patience learned while waiting for fish to bite. [447] "I'll give you anything."

"Echoes are not given," Vela replied. [454] "They are called. [457] By voicing silence." [460]

Maren understood then why she had been chosen for this, why her cool temperament was not a flaw but a gift. [479] She closed her eyes and found the place inside her where all the words lived that she had never spoken—the apologies, the fears, the love she'd been too reserved to express. [508] She opened her mouth and released nothing. [515] Not breath, not sound. [519] Pure, absolute silence given form. [524]

The garden shuddered. [527] The sleepwalking constellations paused in their wandering, and Maren felt something ancient turn its attention toward her. [543]

From the fountain, a whisper emerged, carried on frequencies that bypassed her ears entirely and settled directly into her bones. [562]

"Mama. [563] Don't blame the water. [567] I was trying to reach a star." [574]

Maren's knees buckled, but she did not fall. [582] The rail spike pulsed with colors she had no names for, translating her relief, her sorrow, her terrible and beautiful release into patterns that matched the drifting constellations above. [608]

Vela smiled, and it was the smile of something beyond human reckoning, fierce and gentle as a mother wolf singing her cubs to sleep. [633]

"The echo is yours," the goddess said. [640] "Now go, fisher. [644] The waters will not judge you, and neither will she." [654]

Maren rose slowly, retrieved the rail spike, and walked the zigzag path back toward the garden's edge. [671] Above her, the constellations resumed their sleepwalk, and she realized they had never been lost at all—only searching, as she had searched, for something worth finding. [696]

Behind her, the sound wave garden began its slow fade into frequencies beyond perception, a feral lullaby humming in her wake. [717] She would return to her nets, her boats, her patient waiting for creatures beneath the waves. [733] But she would fish differently now. [739]

She would fish for stars. [744]
