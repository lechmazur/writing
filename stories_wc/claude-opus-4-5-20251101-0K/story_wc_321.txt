The ferry had been vanishing for exactly seventeen minutes when Mara finally understood that time was not a river but a net. [23]

She gripped the rusted railing of the Meridian as the vessel dissolved into silver mist, her deckhand's uniform dampening with spray that smelled of salt and static electricity. [49] Around her, the commuters flickered like old television signals—businessman reading his newspaper, mother clutching her child, elderly woman knitting something that never grew longer. [72] They had been making this crossing for years, or perhaps seconds, trapped in the moment when clocks run sideways and destinations become theoretical. [93]

"Beautiful evening for a dissolving, isn't it?" [100] Mara called out to no one in particular, her voice carrying the bright edge of someone who had accepted the impossible and decided to smile anyway. [122] The passengers didn't respond, but she hadn't expected them to. [133] They never did, these permanent transients, these souls caught between departure and arrival. [145]

The ferry's horn sounded—three long blasts that echoed wrong, bouncing off walls that shouldn't exist. [159] Then the Meridian completed its nightly miracle, sliding through the membrane between worlds and emerging in the spectral grotto. [177]

Mara had discovered this place on her third crossing, when she'd followed the interconnected patterns of phosphorescence that traced the water's surface like a map written in light. [201] The grotto opened beneath a ceiling of raw stone that somehow admitted starlight, impossible stars that burned in configurations from a dozen different skies. [224] Stalactites dripped with luminescent water, and the walls shimmered with reflections of every ferry that had ever been lost. [242]

She pulled the empty hourglass from her pocket, the one her grandmother had given her before the old woman's own disappearance. [260] "Time runs out," her grandmother had said, "but time also runs in, and through, and around." [277] The hourglass had been empty when Mara received it, and she'd spent years believing it broken. [293] Now she understood it was waiting. [299]

The radio crackled at her belt—another impossibility, since the Meridian's communications had died with the engine years ago. [316] But the grotto had its own rules, its own connections. [326] Mara lifted the receiver and heard voices layered like sediment: her own voice, younger; her grandmother's laugh; the captain announcing destinations in languages that hadn't been spoken in centuries. [352]

"I know what you want," Mara said into the static, her resiliently positive nature treating the impossible conversation like any other. [372] "You want to merge the timelines. [378] You want the passengers to arrive." [384]

The response came not in words but in patterns—the phosphorescence on the water rearranging itself, the stars above shifting, the reflections in the walls aligning into a single coherent image. [410] She saw the moment of divergence: the Meridian, fifteen years ago, choosing to go left around the rocks instead of right. [432] One timeline where it arrived safely. [438] One where it vanished forever. [443] The passengers living two lives simultaneously, present in neither. [452]

Mara had been a deckhand on both vessels. [460] She remembered arriving and also remembered never arriving, and somehow she had remained whole while everyone else fractured. [478]

The empty hourglass grew warm in her hands. [486] She understood now—it wasn't measuring time, it was collecting it, gathering the scattered seconds that the Meridian had lost. [504] Via the interconnected patterns of light and sound and memory, she could pour those seconds back into the world. [522]

"This might not work," she told the flickering passengers cheerfully. [531] "But then again, what does, really?" [537]

She upended the hourglass over the glowing water. [545] Nothing visible fell, but the grotto shuddered. [552] The stars wheeled overhead. [556] The radio screamed with a thousand overlapping arrivals. [563]

The businesssman looked up from his newspaper, confused. [571] The mother's child began to cry—actually cry, not just mime the motion. [583] The elderly woman's knitting had grown a full inch. [592]

The Meridian began to solidify, its mist becoming wood, its ghosts becoming flesh. [605] The grotto walls faded, replaced by the familiar harbor lights of a city that had mourned them for fifteen years. [624]

Mara felt herself splitting, the arriving-Mara and the vanishing-Mara trying to occupy the same moment. [640] The pain was extraordinary. [644] She laughed anyway. [647]

When the ferry finally docked, she was the only one who remembered the crossing. [661] The passengers disembarked into a world that had moved on without them, clutching belongings from another decade, blinking at unfamiliar skylines. [680]

Mara stayed aboard, holding her grandmother's hourglass, which had begun to fill with something that looked like starlight. [697]

There were other ferries, other grottoes, other souls caught between. [707]

She had work to do. [712]
