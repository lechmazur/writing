The hospice existed where no earthly hospice should, suspended in a radiant haven above the clouds where light poured through every surface like honey through gauze. [31] Mira had worked here for seven years, guiding the dying through their final transitions with music that made the mundane sacred. [50] She was decisively kind, the sort of person who could tell you the hard truth while making you feel held, who could sing a grocery list and somehow transform it into prayer. [78]

Today she carried a fragment of a broken vinyl record in her pocket, its jagged edge wrapped in tissue paper. [95] It had belonged to Samuel Chen, room forty-three, who had shattered it himself three days ago when the preliminary results suggested what everyone feared. [117] Now they waited, all of them suspended in pulsing stillness, for the blood work to come back and confirm what the shadows on the scans had whispered. [142]

Mira found Samuel sitting by the window that opened onto nothing but sky, clouds drifting below like slow thoughts. [159] His hands trembled against his knees. [165]

"I broke my father's record," he said without turning. [174] "Ella Fitzgerald. The only thing I had left of him." [184]

"I know." [186] Mira sat beside him, not touching, just present. [194] "You were angry." [197]

"I was terrified." [200] His voice cracked on the word. [206] "Still am." [208]

She understood terror. [211] She had seen it transform people, watched it curdle into rage or dissolve into despair. [225] But she had also seen it become something else entirely when met with the right presence. [240] This was her work: not to eliminate fear, but to companion it until it revealed its hidden face. [256]

"Would you like to try something?" she asked. [264]

He finally looked at her, eyes red-rimmed. [271] "What's the point? [274] The results will say what they say." [281]

"The results will come after," she agreed. [288] "But you're here now. [292] Right now, in this moment, you're still breathing." [300]

She pulled out her guitar, the one with the cracked body that she'd never replaced because its imperfection gave it warmth. [319] Then she began hymning the mundane, her voice soft as she sang about the light on the floor, the dust motes swimming in sunbeams, the way his coffee sat cooling on the table. [351]

Samuel listened, first with confusion, then with something like recognition. [361] His shoulders slowly descended from where they'd been hunched near his ears. [372]

When she finished, she withdrew the wrapped record fragment from her pocket. [383] "I found the other pieces," she said. [390] "We could try to reunify them. [396] Not to play again, but to honor what it was." [406]

"It won't be the same." [411]

"Nothing ever is." [414] She smiled, that decisively kind smile that somehow acknowledged loss and hope simultaneously. [426] "But sometimes broken things can hold new meaning." [434]

They spent the next hour at her small worktable, carefully fitting the black shards together with gold-tinted adhesive, the Japanese art of kintsugi applied to vinyl. [459] As they worked, Samuel began to talk about his father, about Sunday mornings and jazz floating through a small apartment, about the scent of hope that always lingered when Ella sang "Summertime." [490]

"He believed better days were coming," Samuel said, pressing two pieces together. [502] "Even at the end. [506] Even when he couldn't lift his head." [513]

The record took shape, veined with gold, more beautiful in its brokenness than it had ever been whole. [529] When they finished, Samuel held it to the light, watching the clouds drift through the cracks. [544]

"I want to execute a flawless goodbye," he said quietly. [554] "If that's what the results demand. [561] I want him to be proud of how I finish." [570]

"Then we'll make it beautiful," Mira promised. [577] "We'll sing every ordinary moment until it shines." [586]

The nurse appeared in the doorway, folder in hand, her expression carefully neutral. [598] The results had arrived. [602]

Samuel inhaled deeply, and Mira caught it then, threading through the sterile air: the scent of hope, inexplicable and undeniable, like honeysuckle through an open window. [627] It wasn't optimism about outcomes. [632] It was something older, something that existed independent of survival or surrender. [643]

He reached for her hand. [648] She took it. [651]

Together, in that radiant haven suspended between worlds, they turned to face whatever came next, the golden-veined record catching light on the table between them, proof that shattered things could still be holy. [686]

The nurse stepped forward. [690]

The stillness pulsed. [693]

And somewhere, somehow, Ella Fitzgerald sang on. [701]
