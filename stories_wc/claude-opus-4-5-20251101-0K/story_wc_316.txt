The floating rock dojo drifted through the churning void where timelines collided and merged, where empires rose and fell in the span of a breath, where history rewrote itself in endless permutations beneath them. [37]

Master Kira had chosen this place precisely because nothing here was permanent. [48]

She knelt on the stone platform, her scarred hands resting on her knees, watching the two figures who had come to claim what sat between them: a glass jar containing a preserved brain, its label reading "DUPLICATE - BATCH 7." [85]

"I am the original," said the woman on the left, her voice sharp as broken glass. [99]

"I am the continuation," said the woman on the right, softer, almost pleading. [112]

They were identical in every physical aspect—the same angular jaw, the same gray-streaked hair, the same constellation of freckles across their cheekbones. [133] But Kira had learned to see beyond surfaces. [140] Three years ago, she had died on a meditation cushion in a monastery burning with civil war, her sense of self dissolving into nothing, her ego shattering into fragments she would never fully reassemble. [168] She had survived that death, emerged from it like a snake shedding skin, and now she could slice through pretense with a single glance. [191]

"You both came to claim custody of your third iteration," Kira said. [203] "The brain that could be grown into another version of yourselves. [214] But neither of you has told me why you actually want it." [226]

The sharp one—Vex, she called herself—laughed bitterly. [234] "Because she'll destroy it. [238] She wants to end our line entirely." [245]

"Because she'll activate it," the softer one—Sera—countered. [253] "She wants an army of herself, endless copies to fill the void where her feelings used to be." [270]

Kira watched the timelines shift beneath the dojo, civilizations flickering like candlelight. [282] She had trained here for two years, learning that truth emerged only through complementary opposites—light defining shadow, silence giving meaning to sound. [302] These two women were halves of a fractured whole, and the brain in the jar was the fulcrum of their conflict. [321]

"Vex," Kira said, "you haven't felt anything real since your original death and resurrection. [335] You seek copies because you believe that through them, you might vivify your own deadened heart, spark something in yourself by watching fresh versions experience the world." [359]

Vex's mask of confidence cracked. [364] Her jaw tightened. [367]

"And Sera," Kira continued, "you feel too much. [376] Every emotion floods you because you were created as the empathic mirror to Vex's analytical mind. [389] You want to destroy the brain because you cannot bear the thought of another consciousness suffering as you do." [407]

Sera's eyes glistened. [410]

"You are both trying to defeat emotional numbness," Kira said. [420] "One by multiplication, one by elimination. [426] Neither path leads where you hope." [432]

The dojo shuddered as a particularly violent historical revision swept through the void—Kira glimpsed pyramids rising, falling, rising again in different configurations. [452] Nothing lasted. [454] Everything returned. [456]

"The brain doesn't belong to either of you," Kira said. [466] "It belongs to itself, to the potential person it might become." [477]

"Then what do we do?" Vex whispered, her pretense finally shattered entirely. [487]

Kira rose. [489] She lifted the jar carefully, watching the preserved tissue float in its nutrient solution. [501] "You stop fighting over custody of your future selves and start taking custody of your present ones." [517]

She placed the jar in the exact center of the platform, where the dojo's meditation circle was carved into stone. [535]

"Vex, you will train with Sera. [541] Sera, you will train with Vex. [548] Through your complementary opposites—her emotional depth, your analytical distance—you will teach each other what you've lost." [564]

"And the brain?" Sera asked. [569]

"Remains here, in sanctuary, until it can choose for itself whether to be vivified. [582] That is the only ethical path." [588]

The two women looked at each other across the jar, across years of hatred and fear and the desperate loneliness of being fractured copies of a dead original. [613]

Vex extended her hand first. [618]

Sera took it. [621]

Below them, history continued its endless revisions, but here on the floating stone, something small and unprecedented began: two broken halves learning they were never meant to be whole alone. [651]

Kira watched them bow to each other, beginning the first form of a practice that might take years or might take forever. [672] She had survived the death of her ego and discovered that identity was not a fixed point but a flowing river. [692]

Perhaps these two would learn the same lesson. [700]

Perhaps the brain in the jar would wake someday to find not enemies fighting over its existence, but family waiting to welcome it home. [722]

The dojo drifted on through the reshaping cosmos, patient as stone, steady as breath. [736]
