She had been the library's guardian for so long that she forgot whether she had chosen the role or grown into it like moss consuming stone. [28] The frozen garden stretched before her now, crystalline roses suspended in perpetual winter, their petals catching what little light pierced the mist. [50] This was not her world. [55] She remembered that much through the fog of centuries—remembered warmth, remembered walls that held books bound in leather rather than frozen time, remembered a sun that moved across a sky instead of hanging motionless behind pearl-gray clouds. [89]

The boundaries of light here were different. [96] They did not cut clean lines between shadow and illumination but bled into each other, creating zones of foggy lucidity where she could think clearly while still feeling the dream-weight pressing against her skull. [127] She existed through the veil of sleep, never fully awake, never quite unconscious, suspended in the same eternal pause as the garden's ice-locked flowers. [151]

Something gleamed beneath the frost near the marble fountain. [160] She approached on bare feet that left no prints, her movements feral and cautious after so many years without company. [179] Her fingers, too long now, too sharp at the nails, brushed away the rime to reveal a pendant—a spiral of black iron wrapped around a stone that pulsed with inner darkness. [209] A cultist's pendant. [212] She recognized the symbols even through dimensions, even through the fog. [222] Someone had been here. [226] Someone had crossed over. [230]

Wait, she told herself. [234] Patience was the first lesson the library had taught her, back when she still had a name, still had skin that didn't shimmer with half-visible scales of frozen light. [259] The guardian must always wait. [264] But the pendant was warm in her palm, impossibly warm, and it pulled at something deep in her chest—that hollow space where homesickness lived like a second heart. [292]

She was dimensionally homesick for a place she could no longer name. [303] The garden's mist curled around her ankles as she stood there, examining the pendant, trying to understand what it meant that someone else had wandered here. [329] The cultists sought power between worlds, sought to unmake the boundaries of light that kept realities from bleeding into each other. [349] Were they enemies? [352] Perhaps. [353] But they were also the only evidence in centuries that she was not entirely alone. [367]

The library had taught her a method for surviving: interiorizing exteriors. [377] She had swallowed the garden whole, made its frost part of her veins, its mist part of her thoughts. [395] She had consumed the endless shelves of frozen books, absorbed their knowledge until she could not distinguish between memory and text. [415] The world outside became the world inside, and she became the guardian by becoming the place itself. [433]

But the pendant resisted absorption. [438] It remained stubbornly other, stubbornly warm, stubbornly connected to somewhere else. [449] She closed her fist around it and felt the pull toward a reality where fires burned and voices spoke and time actually passed. [470]

She had spent so long fighting uncertainty—fighting the not-knowing of whether anyone would ever find her, whether her original world still existed, whether she was alive or dead or something between. [502] The guardian's role demanded vigilance against all intrusion. [510] But now, holding proof that the veil could be crossed, she felt her motivation shifting like ice cracking beneath spring's first warmth. [530]

Perhaps the cultists would return. [535] Perhaps they would bring chaos and darkness and the unmaking of everything she protected. [547] Or perhaps they would bring answers. [553] Perhaps they would bring company. [558]

She decided to make friends with uncertainty. [565] Not to fight the not-knowing, but to sit with it, to let it curl around her like the mist, to accept that the pendant's warmth and the garden's cold could coexist in her palm. [600]

She placed the pendant in the hollow of the frozen fountain where it would be visible to anyone who crossed over. [619] A gift. [621] An invitation. [623] A trap, perhaps, but she no longer cared which. [632]

The boundaries of light shifted overhead as something that was almost dawn or almost dusk rippled through the veil of sleep. [652] She retreated to her library, its frozen spines glittering behind walls of ice, and she waited. [669] The guardian had always been patient. [675] But now patience had a purpose beyond mere preservation. [684] Now she was waiting not just to protect, but to see who might come through the mist, drawn by a cultist's lost pendant and the promise of something strange and lonely and ready, finally, to be found. [720]

The frozen roses held their breath. [727] So did she. [731]
