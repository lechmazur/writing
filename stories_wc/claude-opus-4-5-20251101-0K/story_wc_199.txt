In the ashen skyborne arbor, where great trees grew from clouds of volcanic soot and their roots drank from mist rather than soil, Wren worked as she always had: sorting seeds. [32]

Her fingers moved with practiced precision through the day's harvest, separating the viable from the hollow, the promising from the corrupted. [51] Each seed told a story through its weight, its shell, its subtle imperfections. [63] She had sorted ten thousand seasons' worth, and in that time, she had noticed something peculiar about the falling leaves. [81]

They carried messages. [84]

Not words exactly, but patterns—veins that mapped constellations, edges that curved like half-remembered alphabets. [96] Regional folklore whispered of the First Gardeners, ancient tenders who had planted these sky-trees and encoded their prophecies in the very genetics of the foliage. [116] Wren believed it. [119] She had to believe it, because otherwise the leaves were just leaves, and her life was just sorting, and the grey expanse of the arbor was just emptiness disguised as home. [146]

The timeframe mattered. [149] She had learned this through decades of observation: only during the hush where past meets prophecy—those strange twilight moments when yesterday's echoes and tomorrow's whispers occupied the same breath—could the messages be read clearly. [180] During those hushed intervals, the leaves fell slower, as if time itself paused to watch. [194]

Today felt different. [197] The air held a peculiar weight, mossy and sweet, carrying the green scent of things growing despite all logic. [215] Wren set down her sorting tray and retrieved her most precious tool: a slender probe tipped with a moonstone cabochon dust speck, so small it was nearly invisible, yet it caught light from sources that shouldn't exist in this perpetually overcast realm. [253]

She used it to prod the leaves, gently, reverently, tracing their vein-patterns as the moonstone dust illuminated hidden structures within the cellular architecture. [275] Where she touched, the leaves revealed their secrets—tiny glowing pathways that mapped something vast and incomprehensible. [292]

This was her method of worship, her way of honoring what others dismissed: building tiny monuments to forgotten things. [309] Along the arbor's suspended walkways, she had constructed hundreds of them. [321] A cairn of hollow seeds marking where a rare species had gone extinct. [333] A spiral of bark fragments commemorating a branch that had fallen into the clouds below. [347] A delicate tower of crystallized sap honoring the last words of a dying elder who had also sought meaning in the leaves. [368]

Each monument was small enough to fit in her palm, yet together they formed a constellation of remembrance that stretched across the arbor's expanse. [391]

The hush descended. [394]

Wren felt it like a held breath, like the space between heartbeats. [406] She prodded a freshly fallen leaf—crimson and gold, larger than her hand—and the moonstone dust speck blazed with sudden, impossible light. [426]

The leaf's patterns rearranged themselves before her eyes. [434] Not a message, she realized now. [440] An invitation. [442]

The First Gardeners had not encoded prophecy. [449] They had encoded transformation. [453] Every leaf that fell carried instructions for becoming something new, something that emerges transformed always, that cannot remain static in the face of revelation. [474]

She understood, finally, why she had spent her life sorting seeds. [485] Seeds were potential. [488] Leaves were completion. [491] And she stood at the intersection, a bridge between what things could become and what they had been. [508]

The moonstone dust speck dissolved into her skin, warm and tingling. [519] Wren felt her edges blur, her certainties soften. [527] She was not becoming something inhuman—she was becoming more fully herself, the version that had always existed in the spaces between sorted seeds and studied leaves. [551]

When the hush ended and ordinary time resumed its flow, Wren stood transformed. [564] Her eyes now held flecks of moonstone. [571] Her fingers, when they touched leaves, could read them like braille. [582] The arbor's grey expanse seemed suddenly vibrant, alive with messages she could finally, fully comprehend. [597]

She returned to her sorting tray, but now each seed sang to her of its future tree, its eventual leaves, the messages it would one day drop into waiting hands. [624]

She built a new monument that evening: a tiny structure of woven leaf-veins and seed hulls, marking the spot where an ordinary sorter had become a translator of ancient tongues. [653]

The ashen skyborne arbor stretched endlessly in all directions, patient and full of secrets. [667] Wren smiled, feeling mossy delight bloom in her chest like something long dormant finally finding sun. [682]

There was so much more to decode. [689] There was so much more to remember. [696] And now, finally, she had the tools to do both. [706]
