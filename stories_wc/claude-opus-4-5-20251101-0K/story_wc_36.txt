The Thunder-echo Range had fallen silent since the guardianship ended, its peaks no longer resonating with the old songs that once kept the boundaries sealed. [28] Mira climbed the narrow path toward the Keeper's Hollow, her boots scraping against stone worn smooth by generations of footsteps that would never return. [51] She was the last of them now, the final relic keeper, driven by a purpose her predecessors would have called madness. [69]

The failure still lived in her bones. [76] Three years ago, she had watched the veil between worlds tear open above these very mountains, spilling creatures of smoke and whisper into the mortal realm. [100] The other keepers had died sealing it, their voices joining the thunder that gave these peaks their name. [117] But Mira had survived, and survival demanded understanding. [125]

She paused at a junction where three paths diverged into morning mist. [136] From her pack, she withdrew pieces of driftwood she had collected from the River of Returns, each piece weathered by passage between shores that existed in different realities. [162] Carefully, she began arranging driftwood as directional markers, pointing toward the path where the air tasted of copper and distant rain. [182] The wood remembered its crossings, and it would guide her back if the weaving went wrong. [197]

The hollow opened before her, avalanchingly quiet in a way that pressed against her eardrums like deep water. [214] No wind stirred. [217] No birds called. [220] Even her own breathing seemed to vanish into the stillness, absorbed by stone walls that had witnessed ten thousand rituals. [239]

At the altar's center rested the case she had come for. [250]

Mira knelt before it, her fingers trembling as they found the bronze clasps. [262] She had sworn never to uncase this relic, had promised Master Verren on his deathbed that some instruments were meant to remain silent. [284] But Master Verren had not seen what she had seen. [294] He had not watched the veil's patterns as it shredded, had not glimpsed the logic beneath the chaos. [312]

To harvest insights from failure, she needed to return to the moment of collapse. [326]

She lifted the lid. [330]

The gilded reed flute lay nested in velvet the color of thunderclouds, its surface etched with symbols that seemed to shift when viewed directly. [354] Gold leaf covered its length in patterns that mapped the spaces between worlds, the thin places where reality grew permeable. [374] The old keepers had used it to weave between worlds, stepping sideways into the spaces where time moved differently and truth revealed itself without disguise. [397]

Mira raised the flute to her lips. [404]

The first note emerged not as sound but as sensation, a vibration that rippled outward through the canyon hush. [422] The second note pulled at something behind her eyes. [431] By the third, the hollow's walls had grown translucent, and she could see the shadow-realm pressing against them like water against glass. [454]

She played the sequence she had reconstructed from fragments of memory and desperate research. [467] The melody wove her consciousness sideways, and suddenly she stood in both places at once: the hollow as it existed now, and the hollow as it had been three years ago, filled with screaming keepers and a sky torn open. [506]

She watched the failure unfold from outside time. [514]

There. [515] The flaw in their working, visible now as a dark thread in the weave. [528] They had sung in unison when they should have sung in counterpoint. [540] The veil required tension to hold, opposing forces in balance, and they had offered only harmony. [556]

The insight burned itself into her understanding. [563]

Mira lowered the flute, letting the vision fade. [571] The hollow solidified around her, solid and silent and achingly empty. [582] But she was not empty anymore. [588] She carried knowledge now, purchased with three years of grief and one terrible act of disobedience. [603]

When the veil weakened again, and it would, she would be ready. [615] Not with harmony, but with the beautiful discord that held worlds apart. [627]

She returned the gilded reed flute to its case, closed the clasps, and began the long walk down. [645] Behind her, the driftwood markers pointed homeward, their purpose fulfilled. [656] Above her, the Thunder-echo Range remained silent, but Mira thought she felt something in that silence now. [673]

Not emptiness. [675]

Potential. [676]

The next guardianship would begin with her, alone, armed with the wisdom that only failure could teach. [692] And this time, when she sang to hold the boundaries, her voice would carry the discord of a keeper who had learned to weave between worlds and returned with secrets the dead could never share. [727]
