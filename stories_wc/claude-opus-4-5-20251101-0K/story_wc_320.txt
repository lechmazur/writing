Mira climbed the rusted ladder toward Transmission Spire Nine, her boots finding purchase on rungs that hadn't borne weight in decades. [24] Below her, the gorge yawned like a mouth that had forgotten how to close, its depths lost in perpetual mist. [44] The abandoned radio tower city of Voxhaven stretched across the chasm on cables and platforms, a skeleton of humanity's loudest era now given over to silence. [70]

She was a celestial signal interpreter by trade, one of the few who could parse meaning from the transmissions that leaked through the fabric between stars. [94] Tonight, during lunar perigee, the moon would hang so close that even the dead towers might resonate with frequencies they'd abandoned long ago. [116]

Her motivation was simple, though others called it paradoxical: to find the beginning in every ending. [131] Every signal that faded carried within it the seed of something new. [144] Every collapsed star whispered of the nebula it would become. [155]

The Hollywood star fragment hung from a chain around her neck, a genuine piece of the Walk of Fame she'd excavated from the ruins of Los Angeles. [180] The name etched into it had worn away, but that made it more valuable to her. [196] Anonymous fame, she thought. [200] A celebrity returned to potential. [205]

At the platform's summit, she found the console she'd been seeking, its dials frozen with corrosion. [220] The atmosphere here was serenely electric, charged with the approaching perigee yet utterly calm, as if the air itself held its breath. [243]

Mira set to work. [247] The practical matter of receiving celestial signals required equipment that functioned, so she pulled components from her pack and began splicing them into the ancient circuitry. [273] Fantasy had its place, but machinery demanded respect for physical law. [285]

She needed to tune the array, but every attempt produced static that sounded like screaming. [299] The frequencies were wrong, corrupted by assumptions built into the original engineering. [312] These towers had been designed to broadcast human voices outward, never to receive what might answer back. [328]

By discarding assumptions, she could rebuild the logic. [337] She removed the filters meant to eliminate interference, because what the engineers had called interference was often the signal itself. [357] She reversed the amplification cascade so it would pull inward rather than push outward. [372] She stripped away the comfortable notion that communication meant words. [383]

The moon rose over the gorge's edge, swollen and impossibly near. [395]

The array hummed to life, and what came through was not sound but texture. [410] A shard of hush descended upon Voxhaven, a fragment of cosmic silence so profound it had weight and presence. [430] Mira felt it settle around her shoulders like a cloak woven from the space between heartbeats. [447]

Within that silence, she heard everything. [453]

Stars dying in distant arms of the galaxy sang their endings, and threaded through each death was the chemical promise of new worlds. [476] A civilization she would never know had just transmitted its final message into the void, and buried in its despair was a formula for hope that another species might someday decode. [506]

The Hollywood star fragment grew warm against her chest, as if remembering what it meant to be part of something people believed in. [528]

Mira wept, though she couldn't have explained why. [537] The shard of hush carried no sadness and no joy, only truth: that endings were not walls but doors, and every door opened both ways. [561]

She recorded what she could, knowing her instruments captured only shadows of the full transmission. [576] Tomorrow she would climb back down to the swaying bridges of Voxhaven, return to the enclave of interpreters who waited for her findings, and try to translate silence into something others could use. [607]

But for now, she stood in the serenely electric dark, letting the moon's proximity amplify signals that had traveled for millennia to reach this dead city above a gorge. [637]

The towers around her, built to shout, had finally learned to listen. [650]

When dawn came and the perigee faded, Mira descended with her recordings and her fragment of borrowed fame and the strange peace that came from understanding that nothing truly ended. [678] It only changed frequency, broadcasting on channels the universe was still learning to tune. [693]

She would find the beginning. [698] She always did. [701] That was the practical magic of her work: patience, equipment, and the willingness to hear what others dismissed as noise. [721]

Behind her, Voxhaven's towers caught the first light, no longer abandoned but waiting, ready to receive whatever the cosmos chose to say next. [745]
