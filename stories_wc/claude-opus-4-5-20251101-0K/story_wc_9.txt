The midnight glade floated above the clouds like a secret the sky had forgotten to tell, and Morrigan climbed the last silver ladder with lungs burning and heart full of desperate hope. [32]

She had been searching for three years now, ever since the birth. [44]

Three years since her daughter had drawn breath and Morrigan had felt time itself fracture, moments slipping through her fingers like water through cracked porcelain. [68]

The onyx-ink cartomancer settled onto the moonlit grass, her dark fingers already reaching for the cards that hung at her hip in their leather pouch. [93]

Below her, the cloud sea churned in luminous waves, and above, stars pressed close enough to wound. [110]

She understood now why they called this place the Glade of Cloudbound Repentance—pilgrims came here to confess not to gods, but to the accumulated weight of moments they had squandered. [140]

Morrigan's cards were stained with the same midnight ink that ran through her veins, a gift from her grandmother, who had taught her that divination was not prophecy but archaeology—digging through the sediment of what was to find what had been lost. [181]

She spread the cards across the grass, their faces blank until she breathed upon them. [196]

Images bloomed: her daughter Iris at six months, reaching for light; at one year, speaking her first word; at two, running through summer gardens. [220]

All moments Morrigan had witnessed but somehow failed to hold, time sliding past her like she was made of glass. [239]

From her pack, she withdrew the cracked saucer from Iris's dolls' tea set—the only object that seemed to anchor her daughter's fleeting presence in her memory. [264]

The crack ran through its center like a fault line, a tiny devastation that Iris had wept over before forgetting entirely. [284]

Morrigan had not forgotten. [288]

She placed the saucer at the center of her card spread, willingly perplexed by the ritual she was attempting, uncertain whether this was magic or madness. [312]

Her grandmother had always said the cloudbound glades were where lost time accumulated, pooling like rain in mountain hollows. [330]

If Morrigan could find that reservoir, perhaps she could drink from it, reclaim the hours that had slipped away while she nursed and worried and stared at walls wondering who she had become. [362]

She began the family custom her grandmother had taught her—tracing her hand upon the grass as if it were a birthday tablecloth, the way generations of women in her line had marked their presence at celebrations. [396]

But instead of cloth, the earth beneath her palm grew warm, and instead of ink, light traced the outline of her fingers. [419]

The cards began to rearrange themselves. [425]

Morrigan watched, breathing the choking beauty of the glade—jasmine and ozone and something older, something like grief preserved in amber. [444]

The cards formed a door. [449]

She reached down to unfasten the leather cord at her wrist, the one Iris had tied there on her third birthday, clumsy fingers making seven knots that Morrigan had sworn never to undo. [481]

Now she understood: the cord was the lock. [489]

As the leather fell away, the card-door swung open, and Morrigan saw them—all the lost moments, suspended like fireflies in a vast darkness beyond the grass. [515]

There was Iris's first smile, hovering just out of reach. [525]

There was the afternoon Morrigan had spent crying in the bathroom, certain she was failing, while her daughter napped peacefully—that hour glowed amber and wounded. [549]

There were midnight feedings and lullabies sung half-asleep and a thousand tiny gestures of love performed while Morrigan's mind wandered elsewhere, desperate for rest or solitude or her old self. [581]

She reached into the darkness and touched one moment—Iris at four months, laughing at the way light fell through curtains. [601]

It flooded through her like warm water, and suddenly she remembered not just the image but the feeling, the weight of her daughter against her chest, the smell of milk and clean skin, the absolute certainty that nothing else mattered. [640]

The cracked saucer began to glow. [646]

One by one, Morrigan drew the lost moments back into herself, weeping with the beauty of recovery. [663]

She understood now that time had not been stolen—she had simply been too exhausted, too transformed, too newly-made as a mother to hold it all. [690]

The cloudbound glade had kept it safe. [697]

When dawn began to pink the eastern clouds, Morrigan climbed back down the silver ladder with cards at her hip and cracked saucer in her pocket and three years of love restored to her memory. [732]

Iris was waiting at the bottom, held in her grandmother's arms, reaching toward her mother with tiny hands that Morrigan would trace a thousand times, on a thousand tablecloths, never forgetting again. [764]
