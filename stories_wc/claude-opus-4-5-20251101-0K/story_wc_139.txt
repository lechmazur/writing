The embalming table gleamed under fluorescent lights as Mira arranged her father's tools with mathematical precision. [17] She had inherited his steady hands but not his talent for deception. [29] Where Felix Crane had spent decades crafting false identities and elaborate cons, his daughter found herself drawn to the honest geometry of death—the angles of a peaceful expression, the equations of preservation. [58]

The vintage ink pot sat on the prep room counter, its brass surface tarnished with age and memory. [73] Her father had used it to forge documents for desperate people, selling them new lives at prices that left them broken. [93] But Mira had claimed it for different purposes since taking over the funeral home six months ago. [109]

Tonight, a body waited that would change everything. [117]

Elena Vasquez lay beneath the white sheet, a journalist who had exposed corruption in three governments before someone silenced her permanently. [136] Her sister Maria sat in the viewing room upstairs, waiting with the hollow patience of the bereaved. [152] But Maria had whispered something when she'd brought Elena's body through the back entrance: "She's not really dead." [168]

Mira had learned to recognize the mathematics of desperate trades. [178] Her father's marks had taught her that—the way their eyes calculated risk against hope, survival against cost. [194] Maria's eyes held those same calculations now. [201]

The funeral home had become something her father never intended: a waystation for the hunted. [215] Political asylum seekers found their way here through whispered networks, seeking the one document forger's daughter who wouldn't drain them dry. [235] Mira didn't charge what her father had. [242] She charged only what people could genuinely spare—a fair trade, balanced like the chemical equations she used to preserve the dead. [261]

Elena's chest rose imperceptibly. [265] The sedative would wear off in hours. [272] Mira had studied the compounds carefully, learning which drugs mimicked death convincingly enough to fool border agents and assassins alike. [291]

She uncorked the vintage ink pot and began preparing the documents that would give Elena a new identity. [308] Swedish passport, work visa, medical records showing a history of heart conditions that explained any lingering irregularities in her vital signs. [328] The forgery was perfect—her father's gift, twisted toward redemption. [338]

A knock on the prep room door made her freeze. [348]

"Funeral director?" [350] The voice belonged to Agent Torres, who had been circling Mira's operation for weeks. [363] "We have questions about your recent clients." [370]

Mira set down her pen and covered Elena with the sheet completely. [382] Then she waited. [385]

This was the method her father had never understood—waiting actively, letting rigid thinking liquefies itself against patience. [400] Torres expected her to panic, to make mistakes. [408] Instead, she breathed with the steady rhythm of someone comfortable among the dead. [421]

The door handle turned. [425] Torres entered, eyes scanning the room for evidence of the breach in border security his superiors suspected. [441] His gaze passed over Elena's shrouded form without recognition. [450]

"Working late," he observed. [454]

"Death doesn't keep business hours." [459] Mira gestured to the ink pot, the documents. [467] "Paperwork for tomorrow's service. [471] Mrs. Vasquez lost her sister. [476] Heart condition, very sudden." [480]

Torres studied her face for tells, the same tells her father had exploited in countless marks. [495] But Mira had no tells because she wasn't lying—Elena Vasquez had died tonight, and someone new would wake in her place. [517]

The mathematics balanced perfectly: one death, one resurrection, one fair trade between a woman fleeing murder and a daughter atoning for theft. [538]

"We'll be watching," Torres said finally, finding nothing to grasp. [549]

"I expect you will." [553]

After he left, Mira returned to her work. [561] The ink flowed from her father's pot, spelling out salvation in careful strokes. [575] In four hours, a hearse would carry Elena's "body" to a private airfield. [589] In twelve, she would wake in Stockholm with papers proving she had never been Elena at all. [606]

Maria appeared in the doorway, tears streaming. [613] "How can I repay you?" [618]

Mira thought of her father, who would have named an impossible price. [630] Instead, she said: "Live well. [636] Tell the truth. [639] That's payment enough." [643]

The funeral home hummed with deathly vitality—this place where endings became beginnings, where a con artist's honest child had finally solved the equation her father never could. [670] The mathematics of a fair trade wasn't about taking everything someone had. [683] It was about giving exactly what they needed and accepting only what they could afford to lose. [700]

Elena's chest continued its secret rise and fall beneath the sheet, and Mira smiled at the beautiful geometry of mercy. [719]
