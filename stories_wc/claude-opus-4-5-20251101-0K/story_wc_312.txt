The sapphire viaduct stretched across the morning sky like a frozen river of gemstone, its crystalline arches catching the first light of dawn and scattering it into a thousand shards of blue fire. [37] Corin stood at its center, his robes the color of tepid dishwater, and held the broken ship's bell in his trembling hands. [58]

He was not a great mage. [64] He was not even a particularly good one. [72] His instructors at the Academy had described his magical talent as "lukewarm at best," a phrase that had followed him through three decades of mediocre practice. [96] But mediocrity had never stopped Corin from believing, with all the earnest naivety of a child watching their first sunrise, that he could fix what was broken in the universe. [125]

The last fish had been caught seven days ago. [134] Not the last fish in a pond or a river or even an ocean—the last fish in existence. [151] The Great Salmon of the Cosmic Current had been pulled from the celestial waters by a fisherman who hadn't known what he'd hooked, and with that final catch, the balance of the world had cracked like an eggshell. [190]

Corin understood the problem in terms of dripping rates. [199] Everything in the cosmos leaked, flowed, transferred from one state to another. [211] Water evaporated, rain fell, rivers ran to seas. [220] Life became death became life again. [226] The fish had maintained the drip—swimming endlessly through the channels between worlds, keeping the current moving. [241] Without it, reality was becoming stagnant, pooling in places it shouldn't, leaving other places dangerously dry. [256]

The broken ship's bell had belonged to his mother's fishing vessel, the Constant Hope. [269] It had cracked the day she died, its voice silenced forever—or so everyone believed. [284] But Corin had spent his life studying flow and drip and the patient mathematics of things that moved between states. [302] He knew that sound was just another kind of current, that the bell's ring still existed somewhere, waiting to flow again. [322]

His devotion to this task was brittle, he knew. [331] One sharp blow of doubt and it might shatter entirely. [341] He'd already failed twice to rebuild the bell's voice, and the viaduct—ancient, patient, indifferent—offered no encouragement. [359] The sapphire arches had been built by gods who understood cosmic plumbing in ways mortals never could. [375] Corin was just a lukewarm mage with a broken bell and a theory about dripping. [390]

But theories were all he had. [396]

He began the ritual as dawn painted the crystal blue-gold. [406] The method was simple in concept, impossible in execution: he needed to understand exactly how sound dripped from bronze, how silence accumulated in cracks, how a bell's voice could evaporate into the cosmic current and then, perhaps, condense again. [445]

He measured the hairline fractures with instruments made of spider silk and morning dew. [460] He calculated the rate at which silence had pooled in the bell's hollow interior—seventeen years of accumulated quiet, thick as honey. [481] He traced the paths where sound had once flowed, mapping channels invisible to any eye but his. [498]

The bell began to warm in his hands. [506] Not with magical fire, but with something gentler—the lukewarm heat of patient determination, of hope that refused to be reasonable. [527]

He poured his understanding into the cracks like water, letting it find its own level. [543] The fractures didn't close—that was beyond his power—but they remembered what they'd been. [558] The drip began. [561] Silence leaked out; sound leaked in. [567]

When the bell rang, it was not loud. [575] It was barely a whisper, a single drop of sound falling into an ocean of quiet. [591] But drops accumulated. [594] That was the nature of dripping, of flow, of the patient cosmic current that connected all things. [611]

Far below the viaduct, in waters that had grown still and strange, something stirred. [625] Not the Great Salmon—that was gone forever. [632] But a new current was forming, born from a cracked bell's whisper, guided by a lukewarm mage who understood that even broken things could learn to flow again. [660]

Corin smiled as the sapphire viaduct caught the full light of dawn, and for one perfect moment, his brittle devotion held. [680] The universe dripped on, one drop at a time, carried by the impossible whisper of a bell that should have stayed silent. [702]

It was not a miracle. [707] Miracles required power he didn't have. [713] But it was possible, just barely, plausibly possible—and that was enough. [726]
