The aurora rippled above the tidal bluff like silk torn from dying stars, casting violet shadows across Meren's weathered hands as she arranged the painted rocks in their careful sequence. [32]

Three days had passed since friction disappeared from the world. [42]

Ships no longer sailed—they slid endlessly across glassy seas until they collided with something solid enough to stop them. [61] People learned to grip ropes anchored to bedrock, to move with terrifying deliberation. [74] The eels, however, thrived. [78] Without the water's resistance, they glided through the depths like thoughts through a dreaming mind, and Meren alone knew how to call them back. [101]

She was an eel herder, though the authorities had never managed to prove it. [115] For decades she had evaded their census, their taxes, their curious questions about where the colony's protein supply actually originated. [134] Elusive by nature and necessity, she lived in the spaces between official knowledge. [147]

But now the world had changed, and she needed answers more than anonymity. [160]

The painted rocks—each one bearing geometric symbols in pigments made from crushed seashells and bioluminescent algae—formed a spiral pattern on the slick stone before her. [186] This was the method her grandmother had taught her, the way to harness the sacred patterns that underlay reality itself. [206] Place them correctly, in mathematical sequences that echoed the proportions of nautilus shells and hurricane eyes, and the universe would whisper its secrets. [229]

Meren positioned the seventeenth stone, completing the outer ring. [238]

The vision struck immediately, as it always did. [246]

She saw the friction returning, but wrong—reversed somehow, pulling instead of resisting. [259] She saw the eels twisted into impossible shapes, the aurora going dark, the tidal bluff crumbling into a sea that had forgotten how to hold weight. [286] And behind it all, she saw the moment from twenty years ago that had made this future inevitable. [304]

Her curse had shown her this before. [311]

Precognitively cursed since birth, Meren could see fragments of futures that her very seeing seemed to cement into certainty. [329] Every vision she witnessed became more likely to occur, as though the universe mistook observation for permission. [346] She had learned to look away, to blur her inner eye, to herd her eels and pretend she was ordinary. [366]

But her grandmother had made her promise. [373]

"When the world forgets how to hold itself together," the old woman had said, "you will be the one who remembers the patterns. [396] You must understand them, Meren. [401] Not just use them—understand." [406]

That lingering promise had haunted Meren through every slippery dawn since friction vanished. [418] She had been running from knowledge her whole life, but her grandmother had seen further than any curse, had known this moment would come. [443]

Meren reached into the seal-skin pouch at her hip and withdrew the vial of collapsed star dust. [461]

It had taken her seventeen years to gather enough—scraping it from meteorite craters, trading eels for fragments held by collectors who didn't understand what they possessed. [488] Star dust was the remnant of gravity so intense it crushed light itself, and when placed at the center of a proper geometric sequence, it could anchor a vision without corrupting it. [521]

She poured the shimmering powder into the spiral's heart. [530]

The aurora above her blazed brighter, shifting from violet to gold—a borrowed dawn arriving hours before the sun would rise. [551] In that false light, the painted rocks began to glow with their own luminescence, and Meren finally understood what her grandmother had always known. [576]

The friction hadn't disappeared randomly. [581] Someone had solved the same patterns Meren now traced, but they had solved them backward, undoing instead of understanding. [600]

The eels in the waters below surfaced, hundreds of silver bodies catching the auroral light. [614] They had always known the patterns instinctively, swimming in formations that echoed the mathematics Meren now grasped for the first time. [635]

She could feel the vision trying to form—the dark future pressing against her consciousness—but the star dust held it at bay. [657] For once, she could look without causing. [664] She could understand without condemning. [669]

The solution emerged like tide revealing stone: she had to complete the sequence in reverse, using the eels as living elements of the pattern. [693] They would swim the geometry that friction required, carving it back into the fabric of the world. [712]

Meren stood, her grip sure despite the slick ground. [721]

"I kept my promise," she whispered to her grandmother's memory, to the borrowed dawn, to the eels waiting in patient spirals below. [744]

Then she began to harness the sacred patterns at last, her curse finally serving creation instead of calamity. [762]

The aurora sang above the tidal bluff, and somewhere in the depths, the eels began to dance. [779]
