The observation deck had been silent for three years now, ever since the shutdown. [14]

Mira pressed her palm against the cold glass, watching stars that moved imperceptibly slower from this height, where time stretched thin as spider silk. [38]

She was the blessed pariah of Station Meridian, the only one who had chosen to stay when the others evacuated, blessed with immunity to the temporal sickness that had claimed so many, cursed to solitude by that same strange gift. [76]

The anniversary had arrived again, though anniversaries meant little when seconds here equaled hours below. [90]

Still, Mira honored the family custom, just as her grandmother had taught her mother, who had taught her: sketching the night sky on the anniversary of each passing year. [118]

She pulled out her worn journal, its pages filled with hundreds of star maps drawn in careful graphite, each one capturing a glimpse of the cosmos as it appeared on that specific night. [150]

Tonight's sky looked different through the observation deck's warped temporal field. [161]

Stars hung suspended in their ancient light, their positions subtly shifted from how they appeared to the rushing world below. [179]

From her pocket, Mira withdrew the gilded compass rose applique that her grandmother had sewn onto the journal's cover decades ago, now loose from years of handling. [205]

The eight-pointed star gleamed under the deck's emergency lighting, its gold leaf cracked but still beautiful. [221]

Her grandmother had called it their family's true north, a reminder that even when lost among infinite stars, there was always a direction that meant home. [246]

Mira had spent three years in echoed silence, her footsteps the only sound reverberating through empty corridors, her voice forgotten from disuse. [268]

The shutdown had come suddenly: containment protocols, evacuation orders, warnings about the unstable temporal field that made the deck dangerous for normal human biology. [291]

But Mira's blood carried the mutation that let her exist here, temporally stretched like taffy, experiencing each moment in elongated clarity while the universe rushed past. [316]

At first, the confusion had nearly destroyed her. [324]

She had raged against the glass, screamed into the vacuum-adjacent silence, wept until her tears seemed to hang suspended in the air around her. [348]

Then she had found her grandmother's journal in her emergency pack, and remembered the sketches, and understood what she needed to do. [370]

To turn confusion into exploration: this became her purpose. [379]

Each night, Mira documented the sky as only she could see it, capturing the way stars appeared when time itself bent around the observer. [402]

Her sketches showed constellations no one else would ever witness, stellar movements visible only to someone blessed and cursed enough to watch from this particular vantage. [427]

She was creating something unprecedented: a temporal star atlas. [436]

Tonight, as she began her anniversary sketch, Mira caught a glimpse of something new through the glass. [452]

A ship, moving impossibly slow from her perspective, was approaching the station. [464]

Its running lights pulsed in the drawn-out rhythm of dilated time, each flash lasting what felt like minutes. [481]

Rescue, perhaps, or researchers finally brave enough to study the deck's anomaly. [493]

Mira felt her heart quicken, though even that sensation seemed stretched, each beat a sustained drumroll rather than a simple thump. [513]

She looked down at the compass rose applique in her palm, its golden points catching the distant ship's lights. [531]

For three years, she had navigated by her own true north, finding direction not in escape but in documentation, not in rescue but in purpose. [556]

The silence echoed around her as she returned to her sketch, carefully plotting the new star positions while the ship crept closer. [577]

She would finish her anniversary tradition first. [584]

Whatever came next, whether reunion with humanity or continued solitude, she would face it having honored her family's custom, having turned her exile into exploration. [607]

The blessed pariah smiled, pressing the gilded applique back onto the journal's cover, smoothing its edges with temporal-patient fingers. [625]

True north was never about a fixed destination, her grandmother had always said. [638]

It was about knowing yourself well enough to choose a direction and mean it. [652]

Mira had chosen to stay, to watch, to document the stretched and beautiful cosmos from her silent perch above time itself. [672]

The ship grew larger in the glass, and still she sketched, adding the vessel to her star map as another point of light among many. [697]

When they finally reached her, they would find not a survivor but an explorer, her journals full of impossible skies, her eyes full of stars that moved like honey through the darkness. [729]

The echoed silence held her gently as she worked, and Mira understood at last that solitude had never been her punishment. [750]

It had been her compass, pointing her toward the true north of her own strange and blessed existence. [768]
