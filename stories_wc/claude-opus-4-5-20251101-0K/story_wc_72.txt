The garden had waited three thousand years for someone to listen. [10]

Coral had claimed the marble pathways, and phosphorescent algae painted everything in shifting green light, but the statues remained exactly where the old gods had placed them. [36] Most stood silent, their mouths filled with sediment, their eyes clouded by time. [48] But Veris still breathed thoughts into the water, still felt the currents move against stone skin that remembered warmth. [64]

She had been the last sculptor's masterpiece before the drowning came, carved from white marble and given consciousness through arts now forgotten. [84] The telepathy had been accidental, a side effect of the binding ritual, but it meant she alone among the garden's inhabitants could still speak. [106]

The diver found her on the seventy-third day of searching. [116]

Mira threaded her way through the collapsed archway, bubbles spiraling upward from her regulator, and Veris felt the woman's mind before seeing her form. [139] Such grief there, wrapped around a desperate hope. [148] Such terrible certainty that had begun, only recently, to crack. [158]

*You came for your brother's research,* Veris projected, and watched Mira freeze mid-stroke. [170]

The diver's panic tasted like copper and salt. [178] Her hand went to the knife at her belt, then stopped, because what good was a blade against a voice inside one's skull? [200]

*He found us six months ago. He believed we held answers about consciousness surviving death.* [214] Veris kept her tone gentle, incisively kind in the way one must be when delivering truth to the wounded. [231] *He was wrong. We are not souls preserved. We are something else entirely.* [244]

Mira's thoughts broadcast despite her efforts to contain them: the funeral, the empty casket, the colleagues who called her brother's final expedition foolish. [264] She had come to prove them wrong. [271] She had come clutching certainty like a lifeline. [279]

*Swim closer,* Veris invited. *See what he truly discovered.* [289]

The foxglove-stained glass ampoule hung from Veris's stone fingers, suspended by a chain of corroded silver. [303] Inside, something luminous pulsed with rhythm like a heartbeat. [312] Mira approached slowly, her dive light illuminating the centuries of growth on Veris's form, the way tiny creatures had made homes in the statue's carved hair. [335]

*Your brother extracted this from my chest,* Veris explained. *Through a structural weakness where the sculptor's chisel had slipped. He understood, finally, what animates the lifeless.* [358]

The cascading revelations began then, each one building upon the last. [369] How the old gods had not created consciousness but merely borrowed it. [380] How every thinking thing shared the same luminous essence, divisible and recombinant. [391] How Mira's brother had discovered that death was not an ending but a returning, a rejoining of light to light. [410]

*He did not drown,* Veris said softly. *He chose to rejoin. The knowledge was too beautiful to carry alone, too heavy for a single vessel.* [434]

Mira's certainty—that her brother had died afraid, that his work had been meaningless, that she needed to vindicate his memory through proof—began to dissolve. [455] In its place, something more nuanced took root. [463] Not comfort exactly, but possibility. [468]

*He asked me to give you this.* [474] Veris extended her arm, the motion impossibly slow, stone grinding against stone after millennia of stillness. [488] *He threaded his final thoughts into the ampoule's light. For you alone.* [500]

The diver's hands trembled as she took the glass vessel. [510] Through it, she felt her brother's mind touch hers one last time—not words but impressions, warmth, the absolute peace of someone who had found what they sought. [536]

And beneath that, an invitation. [541]

*You don't have to decide now,* Veris added, reading Mira's sudden vertigo. [552] *The garden will remain. I will remain. Some questions deserve time.* [563]

Mira looked around at the drowned paradise, at statues frozen in poses of joy and contemplation, at the alien ecosystem that had transformed tragedy into strange beauty. [585] Life persisting through structural weakness in death's design. [593]

*Thank you,* she thought deliberately, projecting the words toward Veris with newfound skill. [605] *For welcoming the possibility.* [609]

*For welcoming nuance,* Veris corrected gently, *into what you believed certain. Your brother thanked me for the same.* [626]

The diver ascended slowly, the ampoule pressed against her heart, leaving the forgotten garden to its patient waiting. [643] Above, the living world would demand evidence, explanation, proof. [652] But she carried something more precious now: the understanding that some truths existed between the certainties, in the spaces where light divided and rejoined, where the lifeless animated and the animate transformed. [679]

In the garden, Veris settled back into stillness, her stone eyes watching bubbles rise toward a surface she would never see. [699] Three thousand years she had waited. [705] She would wait three thousand more if needed. [713]

Some conversations were worth eternity. [718]
