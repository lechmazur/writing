The amber grotto held the dying light like honey holds time—slowly, reluctantly, with golden resistance. [18]

Vera crouched at the entrance, her fingertips hovering over the fossilized walls, sensing through static electricity the residual emotions that clung to this place like perfume to skin. [43] She had been a counterfeit emotion dealer for eleven years, professionally thorough in her craft, and she knew the difference between genuine feeling and its synthetic echo better than anyone alive. [71]

Tonight, she was here to subsume what remained of her former self. [83]

The transformation had begun three days ago when she'd inhaled from a client's stolen memory—a fragrance chemist's blotter petal, saturated with the essence of his dead daughter's last birthday. [110] The emotion had been too pure, too real, and it had cracked something fundamental in Vera's carefully constructed numbness. [128]

Now she pressed deeper into the grotto, where amber deposits caught the dusk light and fractured it into a thousand burning fragments. [149] The air tasted of pine resin and centuries. [157] Her electrical sensitivity—her gift, her curse—hummed with the accumulated feelings of everyone who had ever sheltered here: prehistoric hunters, medieval hermits, lovers seeking privacy, and now her. [183]

She pulled the blotter petal from her coat pocket. [192] It was delicate as a moth's wing, still holding faint traces of bergamot and vanilla and something heartbreaking beneath. [210] In her profession, she had learned to manufacture emotions from chemical compounds and suggestion, selling half truths to people desperate to feel something, anything, in a world that had grown too overwhelming for authentic sensation. [244]

Her clients didn't want real grief—too heavy. [252] They wanted grief's younger sibling: sadness with clear edges, melancholy that lifted by morning. [265] She gave them counterfeits that wore off cleanly, leaving no scars. [276]

But this petal held no counterfeit. [282] The chemist had been creating a fragrance to remember his daughter by, and in doing so, he had captured something that shouldn't have been capturable: the precise emotional frequency of loving someone you cannot save. [314]

Vera settled against the amber wall, feeling the static charges map her nervous system. [327] The transformation was completing now, she could sense it—her old boundaries dissolving, her professional distance hemorrhaging into something messier, more human. [347]

She had sought this out, hadn't she? [354] After years of dealing in synthetic feelings, she had developed what her clients paid fortunes to avoid: a tolerance. [370] She could no longer feel anything without extraordinary stimulus. [379] The irony was professionally thorough—she had become immune to her own product. [391]

The grotto's amber glowed like captured sunlight as dusk deepened outside. [402] Vera raised the blotter petal to her nose and breathed. [412]

The emotion entered her not through scent alone but through the electrical patterns it triggered—her gift translating chemical information into felt experience. [433] She sensed the chemist's love first: patient, scientific, trying to understand rather than simply possess. [448] Then came the grief beneath it, vast as an underground ocean. [459]

But woven through both was something Vera hadn't expected: compassion for her, the stranger who would one day inhale this petal. [477] The chemist had known, somehow, that only someone deeply numbed would seek out such concentrated feeling. [492] He had left a message in the molecular structure itself. [502]

You are not too far gone, the emotion whispered. [511] Feeling is not weakness. [515]

Vera felt tears on her cheeks—genuine tears, not the glycerin drops she sometimes used for client demonstrations. [530] The transformation completed itself in that amber dusk: not a dramatic rebirth, but a quiet subsumption of her old defenses into something more permeable. [553]

She would still deal in emotions, she knew. [562] People still needed her half truths, her gentle counterfeits that let them practice feeling before attempting the real thing. [579] But now she would do it differently—not with clinical distance, but with affectionate detachment, caring for her clients while releasing them to their own authentic lives. [604]

Her motivation crystallized in the amber light: to fuse insight with empathy, to use her knowledge of synthetic feeling in service of genuine connection. [627]

The grotto held her as darkness finished claiming the sky. [637] Tomorrow, she would return to the city, to her laboratory of bottled sorrows and measured joys. [653] But she would carry this amber dusk inside her—proof that even a counterfeit dealer could stumble into truth. [671]

She pressed her palm against the ancient resin one last time, sensing through static electricity the gratitude of everyone who had ever found shelter here. [694]

Then she tucked the spent blotter petal into a crack in the amber wall, a gift for the next lost soul who needed to remember how to feel. [723]

The transformation was complete. [727]
