The quartz-eye mender had been climbing for three hours when she finally pulled herself onto the first rafter, her crystalline left eye catching the amber light that filtered through the cathedral's broken rose window. [37]

Above her, the orchard sprawled impossibly across the wooden beams—apple trees rooted in centuries of accumulated dust and decay, their branches heavy with fruit that glowed like lanterns against the vaulted ceiling. [68]

Mira wiped her brow and laughed at the absurdity of it all. [80]

The breach of contract had changed everything. [87]

When the old guild dissolved, taking with it the accumulated knowledge of three hundred years of eye-mending, she'd assumed the craft would die with her generation. [112]

The deciduous vows her grandmother had spoken of—promises that fell away each autumn only to be renewed each spring—had finally dropped for good. [135]

Or so she'd thought. [139]

Her granddaughter Petra had found the letter in the abandoned guild hall, written by Mira's own daughter before she'd died: directions to this place, to the last repository of mending knowledge. [169]

Mira touched the faded hair ribbon tied around her wrist, the one she'd kept since her daughter was seven. [188]

It had been blue once. [193]

Now it was the color of fog. [200]

"You're slower than a drunk beetle," Petra called from above, already perched on a higher beam with an apple in her hand. [221]

The girl was endearingly feisty, all sharp elbows and sharper tongue, but her fingers had the steadiness that marked true menders. [242]

"Respect your elders," Mira grunted, hauling herself higher. [250]

"I'll respect you when you catch up." [257]

Petra grinned, and for a moment, she looked exactly like her mother. [269]

The old bag Mira had grabbed from the guild hall bumped against her hip as she climbed. [286]

She'd nearly left it behind, dismissing it as empty junk. [296]

But Petra had insisted they bring everything, every scrap. [305]

Now, wedged between two massive branches that had grown together over decades, Mira finally opened it properly. [321]

Inside: three quartz crystals of varying opacity, a vial of solution that smelled of pine and copper, and a journal bound in leather so soft it felt like skin. [350]

Her daughter's handwriting filled every page. [356]

"What is it?" Petra dropped down beside her, suddenly serious. [366]

"Instructions," Mira whispered. [369]

"For what?" [371]

Mira's quartz eye whirred as she focused, the mechanism her daughter had helped her build forty years ago still functioning perfectly. [391]

"For teaching you. [394]

She wrote down everything I taught her, everything my mother taught me. [406]

She must have known the guild would fall." [414]

Petra leaned closer, reading over her shoulder. [421]

"There's a whole section on lens calibration. [428]

And look—diagrams for treating crystal cataracts." [434]

The accidental wisdom of hoarding struck Mira then: her daughter had packed this bag years ago, probably intending to organize it later, and never had. [456]

And now that forgotten collection held everything they needed. [465]

"We persist," Mira said, half to herself. [472]

"What?" [473]

"That's what the deciduous vows mean. [479]

We let go, but we come back. [486]

We keep coming back." [490]

Above them, the orchard rustled, leaves drifting down like green snow. [501]

Somewhere, a bird had made its nest in an apple tree growing sideways from a Gothic arch. [518]

Life finding purchase in impossible places. [524]

Mira untied the hair ribbon from her wrist and pressed it into Petra's palm. [538]

"Your mother would have wanted you to have this." [547]

Petra stared at it, then at her grandmother. [555]

"It's just a ribbon." [559]

"It's a promise," Mira corrected. [564]

"That I'd teach her everything. [569]

Now I'll teach you instead." [574]

Petra tied it around her own wrist, the fog-colored silk bright against her brown skin. [590]

"Then start teaching, old woman. [595]

We've got an entire orchard to explore and I want to know why my left eye keeps going fuzzy." [614]

Mira laughed—really laughed—for the first time in months. [623]

"Probably because you keep staring at those crystals without proper shielding, you stubborn creature." [636]

"I learned stubbornness from you." [641]

"You learned it from your mother, and she learned it from me, so technically you're triply cursed." [658]

They climbed higher together, grandmother and granddaughter, into the impossible orchard where knowledge waited like ripening fruit. [675]

The breach of contract had ended one era. [683]

But here, in a cathedral reclaimed by growing things, another was quietly beginning. [695]

The vows would fall again, Mira knew. [702]

They always did. [705]

But spring always returned, and so would they. [713]
