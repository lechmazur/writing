The falcon returned at dusk, settling on the antenna tower with ice crystals clinging to its jesses. [18] Maren watched it from the outpost window, her breath fogging the glass in slow, rhythmic clouds. [33] She had been waiting seventeen days. [39]

The rusted outpost crouched at the edge of the frozen lake like something ashamed of itself, all oxidized panels and groaning joints. [59] Once it had been a research station; now it was merely the last waypoint before the unmapped territories where cartographers feared to speculate. [82] Maren had spent two decades correcting their speculations, her red pen bleeding through atlases with subtly confident strokes. [99] "Rivers don't begin where you want them to," she would tell her junior editors. [114] "They begin where they must." [119]

The phrasebook sat open on the desk, its corner dog-eared so severely the page had nearly separated from the binding. [139] Someone before her—another searcher, another fool—had marked the Evenki phrase for "headwaters." [152] The translation was wrong, of course. [158] The word actually meant something closer to "the place where water remembers its purpose." [172] Maren appreciated the distinction. [176]

She pressed her fingertip to the window and drew a line through the condensation, tracing the route the falcon had flown. [197] The bird's return meant confirmation: the passage north was open, however briefly. [210] In three days, perhaps four, the ice would shift again and seal everything until spring. [226] This was her singular convergence—the moment when timing, terrain, and terrible stubbornness aligned. [239]

"You're actually going," said Volkov from the doorway. [248] He ran the outpost's communications, though there was rarely anyone to communicate with. [262] His voice carried the worrying tranquility of a man who had stopped being surprised by death. [278]

"The Selenga's tributaries are documented incorrectly in every atlas published since 1967," Maren said, not turning from the window. [296] "Forty-three maps, forty-three lies. [301] Someone has to herald the correction." [307]

"Herald." [308] Volkov almost smiled. [311] "You make it sound noble." [316]

"I make it sound necessary." [321] She studied the condensation pattern, watching how moisture gathered differently where the glass was scratched versus smooth. [338] The same principle applied to watersheds: water followed paths of least resistance, pooling in the scars geography had accumulated. [356] If she understood the scars, she could trace anything to its source. [368]

The phrasebook's dog-eared page fluttered as the outpost's heating system coughed to life. [382] Maren closed the book and slipped it into her pack. [393] Wrong translations or not, languages were maps too—they showed where people had traveled and what they had needed to name. [414]

"There's a reason nobody comes back with proof," Volkov said. [425] "The terrain doesn't want to be known." [432]

"The terrain doesn't want anything." [437] Maren finally turned to face him. [443] "That's the comfort of geography. [448] It simply is. [451] We're the ones burdened with wanting." [457]

She wanted to find where the rivers began because every other question in her life had proven unanswerable. [474] Why her daughter had stopped calling. [480] Why her wife had packed methodically rather than in anger. [490] Why competence had never been enough to make her lovable. [500] But rivers—rivers had origins you could stand in. [509] Rivers had truth you could photograph and measure and defend against editorial committees. [522]

The falcon screamed once from its perch, impatient or hungry or simply cold. [535] Maren shouldered her pack and checked the GPS unit she didn't entirely trust. [548] Maps lied, instruments failed, but condensation on glass always told you something true about temperature differentials. [563] She had learned to read smaller languages than that. [572]

"If I'm not back in twelve days, file the revised coordinates anyway," she told Volkov. [587] "My notes are in the green folder. [594] The Selenga deserves accuracy even if I don't return to insist on it." [607]

The frozen lake accepted her weight without complaint, ice groaning its ancient vocabulary beneath her boots. [622] Behind her, the outpost's lights flickered in the growing dark, worryingly peaceful against the white expanse. [639] Ahead, somewhere in the territory where maps dissolved into speculation, water remembered its purpose and waited to be found. [657]

Maren walked north, following the falcon's trajectory, her breath marking the air with small temporary clouds that vanished almost instantly. [676] The rivers began somewhere. [680] Everything did. [682] She had simply decided, with the subtly confident resolve of someone who had stopped asking permission, to be present when geography finally confessed its secrets. [704]

The ice held. [707] The silence held. [710] Maren kept walking toward the source of something, trusting that finding it would be enough. [726]
