The gargantuan shell had been her home for three hundred years. [11]

Minerva traced her fingers along the nacreous walls, feeling the whorls that spiraled upward into darkness, and remembered when she had first crawled inside this abandoned dwelling of some cosmic mollusk long dead. [44] She had been running then, fleeing the war between the Sun Speakers and the Moon Hollowed, carrying nothing but a galaxy postcard pressed against her chest like a talisman. [72]

The postcard showed the Andromeda spiral, rendered in pigments that still shimmered faintly after all this time. [88] Her mother had given it to her the night before the bombing, whispering, "Find somewhere beautiful to remember me." [106] Minerva had found somewhere vast instead, somewhere that echoed with ocean memory and calcium prayers, and she had made it beautiful through centuries of longing. [130]

She could not sleep. [134] She had never been able to sleep, not since the war's first thunder cracked open her childhood bedroom. [152] The insomnia had become her companion, then her medium, then the very ink with which she wrote her verses across the shell's interior walls. [176] Each poem glowed with bioluminescent algae she had cultivated, words blooming blue-green in the perpetual twilight. [193]

Tonight, as every night, she stood at the shell's aperture and sang. [206]

Her voice was not beautiful—it wavered and cracked, drifted flat and sharp by turns. [221] But the wind that swept through the shell's chambers caught her half-sung lullabies and carried them outward, transforming them into something stranger and more tender than music. [249] Across the reef where the shell rested, creatures stirred at the sound. [262] Small things with translucent bodies emerged from crevices to listen. [272] Larger shadows paused in their hunting. [278]

This was how she had brokered the blossom armistice, all those decades ago, when the reef's factions had been tearing each other apart in their own miniature echo of the war she'd fled. [308] Not through negotiation or force, but through lullabies sung off-key into an off-key wind, carrying peace like pollen into enemy waters. [332] The fighting had stopped, and in its place, flowers of coral had bloomed where blood had clouded the sea. [352]

Minerva was shyly unstoppable. [356] She did not announce herself or demand attention, but neither could she cease her work. [371] The pain inside her—her mother's face, the smoke, the silence where a city had been—demanded transmutation. [388] She had learned to photosynthesize that darkness, to turn grief into something that fed others, the way plants turned light into life. [410]

She ensconced herself deeper in the shell when the memories grew too vivid. [423] In the innermost chamber, where the spiral wound tightest, she had created her sanctuary: walls covered in luminous verse, the galaxy postcard mounted in a frame of polished shell-fragment, a nest of sea-silk where she never slept but sometimes rested her exhausted eyes. [468]

There was joy here, she had discovered. [476] Not the bright joy of before, but something deeper—reef-shadow joy, the happiness that lived in filtered light and hidden places. [497] It moved slowly, this joy, like the creatures that grazed on her glowing words as if they were sustenance. [516] Perhaps they were. [519] Perhaps poetry, like algae, could nourish. [525]

A century ago, a young thing with too many arms had come to her with its own war wounds, its own inability to sleep. [548] She had taught it to write. [554] Now its verses spiraled up the chamber adjacent to hers, red-orange against her blue-green, a conversation in light. [572] Others had come since—refugees of a hundred tiny catastrophes, drawn by lullabies on the wind. [588]

The shell was no longer empty. [594] It was a library, a hospital, a monument to survival. [605]

Minerva looked at the galaxy postcard, at the spiral that mirrored her home's architecture, and finally understood what her mother had meant. [626] Beauty was not a place you found. [633] It was something you built, poem by poem, across centuries of longing, from the raw material of everything you had lost. [655]

She opened her mouth and began another lullaby, letting the imperfect wind carry it where it needed to go. [674] Somewhere in the reef's darkness, something wounded lifted its head to listen. [687]

Somewhere, a war was ending. [692]

And Minerva, sleepless and shyly unstoppable, wrote another line of light upon her walls, transmuting one more fragment of ancient sorrow into something that would feed the dark. [721]
