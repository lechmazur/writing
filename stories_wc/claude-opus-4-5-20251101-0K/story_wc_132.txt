The rain had stopped only an hour ago, but Vera knew it would return. Storm season never offered more than brief respites, just enough time to check on her most vulnerable specimens before the sky opened again. [42]

She walked the gravel path toward the old trellis at the back of her nursery, where moss had claimed every surface in soft emerald layers. [66] Water still dripped from the wooden lattice in slow, meditative rhythms. [77] This was where she came to think, though lately thinking had become dangerous. [90]

At sixty-three, Vera had spent four decades studying plant behaviors, documenting how her seedlings responded to music, to conversation, to the phases of the moon. [114] Her notebooks filled entire shelves, crammed with observations that academic botanists dismissed as unscientific. [128] She didn't care. [131] The plants told her things that instruments couldn't measure. [140]

But this morning, the linden tree had shown her something that frightened her. [153]

She reached into her apron pocket and withdrew a single leaf, still damp from when she'd found it pressed against her kitchen window at dawn. [178] The linden stood fifty feet from her house. [187] No wind could have carried it there, not through the maze of greenhouses and hedges. [201] Yet there it had been, as if placed deliberately. [210]

Vera turned the leaf over in her weathered hands. [219] The veins formed a pattern she recognized from her dreams—the same branching network that had appeared in her sleep for weeks now, spreading across her vision like roots seeking water. [250]

"What do you want from me?" she asked the air, her voice circuitously sincere, wrapping around the question she really meant: What am I becoming? [275]

The answer came not in words but in sensation—a pulling at the base of her spine, a green stirring in her blood that she'd been ignoring since spring. [304]

Her body was changing. [308] The bark-like patches on her forearms that she'd blamed on age. [320] The way she'd stopped needing breakfast, then lunch, finding herself standing in sunlight for hours instead, inexplicably satisfied. [338] The dreams of roots. [342]

Storm clouds gathered again on the horizon, purple and inevitable. [352]

She had fought this metamorphosis with every tool at her disposal—creams, doctors, denial. [365] But resistance only made the transformation more painful, like a stem forced to grow against its nature. [382] Her plants had taught her this lesson a thousand times: growth cannot be commanded. [395] It can only be permitted. [400]

Vera pressed the linden leaf to her chest and closed her eyes. [412]

To reconstruct herself, she understood now, she would have to release control entirely. [425] Let the change move through her like water through soil. [435] Stop asking why and simply allow. [441]

The first drops of new rain touched her face. [450] She tilted her head back and felt the moss beneath her feet pulse with welcome. [465] The trellis seemed to lean toward her, its ancient wood remembering when it too had been alive, had grown, had transformed. [486]

Her fingers tingled. [489] When she looked down, she saw green threading through her veins, visible just beneath the skin like leaves pressed under glass. [508] Fear rose in her throat, but she breathed through it, letting it pass like weather. [524]

This was what she'd spent her life studying, she realized—not plant behaviors, but the language of becoming. [541] Every seed she'd nurtured had been teaching her the same truth: that change requires surrender, that growth demands the death of what came before. [566]

The rain fell harder now, and Vera laughed—a sound like wind through branches. [580] Her hair began to silver into something finer, lighter, more like silk from milkweed pods. [595] Her feet, bare against the moss, felt roots descending, testing, questioning the soil. [609]

She would not become a tree. [615] She understood that now, holding the linden leaf that had summoned her here. [628] She would become something new, something between—a translator standing at the border of two kingdoms, finally fluent in both tongues. [650]

The storm broke fully overhead, and Vera remained at the mossy trellis, letting the rain wash away her old boundaries. [670] Tomorrow, she would open her nursery as always. [679] Her customers would notice something different about her—a greenish tint to her skin, perhaps, or the way flowers turned to face her—but she would smile and speak of weather and fertilizer, keeping her transformation private as prayer. [718]

For now, she simply stood in the sustaining downpour, reconstructing herself one released breath at a time, becoming what she had always been meant to be. [746]

The linden leaf dissolved in her hands, returning to the earth, its message finally delivered and received. [763]
