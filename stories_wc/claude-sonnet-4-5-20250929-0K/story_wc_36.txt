The Thunder-Echo Range held its breath as Maren climbed the final slope, her pack heavy with the gilded reed flute she had sworn to protect. [27] For fifteen years she had been its keeper, guarding it in the monastery's vault, and for fifteen years she had failed to understand why. [52] Now, after the guardianship had passed to younger hands, she had finally been released to seek the answer that had eluded her. [75]

The mountain's silence was avalanchingly quiet—not peaceful, but oppressive, as though the world itself withheld judgment. [92] Thunder never came here anymore, only its memory reverberating through stone corridors and canyon depths. [107] Maren had read the old texts: this place had once been a junction, a thin point where worlds pressed close enough to touch. [131]

She began arranging driftwood at the canyon's mouth, ancient pieces bleached white by centuries of flash floods that no longer came. [151] Each piece she positioned carefully, following the diagrams she had memorized from forbidden manuscripts. [165] The wood formed arrows, spirals, signs that meant nothing in this world but everything in the spaces between. [184] Directional markers for travelers who moved through different dimensions than height and width and depth. [200]

Her hands trembled as she worked. [206] Failure had been her constant companion during the guardianship—every ritual performed precisely, every protection maintained flawlessly, yet the flute had remained inert, purposeless, a beautiful cage for silence. [234] The younger keepers whispered that perhaps there was nothing to understand, that some relics were simply meant to be preserved, not used. [257] But Maren had felt something else in those long nights standing vigil: potential, coiled and waiting. [273]

The driftwood pattern complete, she knelt at its center and began to uncase the flute. [289] The gilded surface caught the thin sunlight, scattering it into fragments that didn't quite behave as light should. [307] She had never been permitted to remove it from its protective wrappings before. [321] The monastery's laws were absolute: observe, protect, never touch. [331] But she was no longer bound by those laws. [341]

The flute felt warm, almost alive. [347] Maren raised it to her lips, remembering the single instruction passed down through generations of keepers: play only in the place where thunder remembers itself. [372]

The first note emerged soft, barely a whisper in the canyon hush. [385] The second note followed, and the air began to fold. [396] Not metaphorically—she watched it crease like fabric, creating angles that hurt to perceive. [410] The driftwood markers began to glow with foxfire light, each piece pointing toward the same impossible direction: inward. [428]

Through the folds, Maren glimpsed what lay between: other ranges, other canyons, stretching through probability and choice. [445] In one, the Thunder-Echo Range roared with perpetual storms. [455] In another, it had crumbled to dust millennia ago. [465] In a third, it had never existed at all. [475]

She understood now. [478] The flute didn't belong to one world—it was a needle for weaving between them, a tool for those who needed to step sideways through reality. [504] Her failure had been in thinking it was meant to do something in her world, when its purpose was to facilitate passage beyond it. [529]

The canyon's silence deepened, becoming a presence rather than an absence. [540] Maren lowered the flute and watched the folds slowly smooth themselves back into normal space. [556] The driftwood markers crumbled to ash, their purpose fulfilled. [566]

She had her insight now, harvested from fifteen years of misunderstanding. [577] The relic she had kept was never meant to be kept—it was meant to open doors. [594] And now, standing in the avalanchingly quiet heart of the Thunder-Echo Range, Maren faced a choice: return to the monastery with her knowledge, or step through those folds herself and discover what lay in the spaces between worlds. [630]

She raised the gilded reed flute again. [637] The thunder's echo, silent for so long, began to wake. [648] This time, when she played, she didn't stop at two notes. [660] The canyon walls remembered what they had been, and the worlds began to weave. [675] Maren stepped forward into the fold, driven not by duty now, but by understanding earned through failure's patient teaching. [694] The Thunder-Echo Range watched her disappear, its hush finally broken by the sound of doors opening between forever. [712]
