The terrace drifted through gray space, its crystalline edges refracting nothing into everything. [13] Mara stood at the boundary where glass met void, her fingers tracing the wooden rail worn smooth by travelers who no longer existed. [35] She analyzed the grain carefully—oak rings compressed by decades, each whorl a record of distance kept and distance closed. [55] The pattern reminded her of her father's corn mazes, those calculated pathways designed to confuse and enlighten simultaneously. [73]

She had been twelve when he vanished into his own creation. [85] That autumn, he'd grown obsessed with what he called "necessary distances"—the exact spaces required between turning points to transform confusion into revelation. [108] The maze that year sprawled across forty acres, its corridors measured with surveyor's precision. [123] He'd carried his pilot logbook everywhere, though he'd never flown, filling its margins with weather codes: CAVOK for clear skies, NOSIG for no significant change. [149] Weather patterns, he insisted, were just another kind of maze. [160]

The search parties found the logbook in the maze's heart, opened to a page where he'd written: "Some thresholds feel sacred because they measure what we're willing to cross." [188]

Now Mara inhabited this aftermath—the world after the butterfly effect, after one architect's obsession rippled outward and unmade causality itself. [209] The drifting prism terrace was what remained: a fragment of reality suspended in probability's wake. [226] Others lived here too, displaced souls learning to intuit direction where conventional space had failed. [242]

She was featherly determined—that's what the other residents called her approach. [254] Light as down, persistent as migration. [261] Each morning she studied the furniture salvaged from collapsed timelines: chairs that existed in three states simultaneously, tables whose legs touched floors that weren't there. [286] In the wood grain, she found her father's mathematics. [296]

The oak rail beneath her hands showed a disruption at year twenty-three—when he'd built his first maze. [314] The growth rings tightened, compressed by something invisible. [323] Pressure from without, or discipline from within? [331] She closed her eyes and let her fingertips read the story. [343]

Behind her, footsteps whispered across the terrace's impossible surface. [352] Thomas, another refugee, approached with his fractured hush—that particular way survivors here had of speaking, voices cracked into careful quiet. [372]

"You're still searching," he said. [377]

"I'm still finding," Mara corrected. [382] She opened her eyes to the gray expanse where directions were suggestions. [395] "He wasn't lost. [398] He was measuring." [401]

Thomas studied the rail with her. [407] "Measuring what?" [409]

"The distance between staying and leaving. [415] Between father and architect. [419] Between the child who needed him and the vision that consumed him." [432] She traced a particularly tight spiral in the wood. [442] "Every maze he built was practice for the final threshold." [453]

"You think he found what he sought?" [460]

Mara intuited the answer in the grain's culmination—where the rings suddenly smoothed, spacing themselves with perfect equanimity. [479] Peace, or dissolution? [482] Transcendence, or abandonment? [485] The wood held both truths. [490]

"I think he learned that sacred thresholds aren't about the crossing," she said. [503] "They're about standing at the edge long enough to understand what the distance means." [518] She pulled the pilot logbook from her pocket—she'd carried it for years, adding her own notations. [535] Beside his final weather code, BECMG—becoming—she wrote her own: PRESNT—present. [547]

The terrace shimmered, its prism walls catching light from somewhere beyond the gray. [561] For a moment, she glimpsed other terraces, other refugees, all analyzing their salvaged fragments, all measuring necessary distances. [579]

"Will you build mazes?" [583] Thomas asked. [585]

Mara smiled, feeling the oak's grain beneath her palm like a map home. [599] "I'll build thresholds," she said. [605] "And teach people it's okay to stand at them. [616] To measure the distance. [620] To choose." [622]

The fractured hush deepened around them, but within it, Mara heard her father's voice reading weather codes, felt his featherly determined hands guiding hers through the first maze, teaching her that some paths lead outward by spiraling in. [657]

She had found him after all—not lost in the maze, but distributed through it, present in every threshold she chose to honor rather than cross. [683]

The necessary distance, she understood now, was love. [692]
