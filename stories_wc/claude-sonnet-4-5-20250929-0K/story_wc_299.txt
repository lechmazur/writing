The speaker grille cloth hung from Marcus's desk lamp, a tattered square of black fabric punctured with rust holes. [19] He'd carried it through three decades and a dozen lives, this scrap from the Marshall stack that had blown out during Whitesnake's '87 tour. [44] Now it swayed in the drafty quarry office trailer like a prayer flag for everything he'd lost. [61]

Outside, limestone dust settled over machinery that hadn't moved in two weeks. [73] The quarry had shut down after Marcus publicly misidentified a supposed Ming vase on the local news segment—confidently uncertain, the station manager had called him, which was both generous and devastating. [104] The vase was a reproduction, worth thirty dollars instead of thirty thousand, and Marcus's reputation as an antiques appraiser had crumbled faster than the sedimentary rock surrounding this trailer. [131]

He touched the grille cloth, remembering the roar that came after the applause, when crowds dispersed and roadies like him broke down the stage in holy silence. [156] That's when the real work happened, when purpose felt solid. [166] Now he sat alone in this aluminum box, hired to appraise the former owner's collection before the bank seized everything, and he couldn't even trust his own eyes anymore. [192]

The trailer door banged open. [196] Sarah Chen, the bankruptcy attorney, stomped in with a wooden crate. [207] "Found this in the site manager's house," she said. [217] "Tell me it's worth something." [222]

Marcus pulled the crate closer, insulating emotionally with facts the way he always did when fear crept too close. [241] "Pine construction, dovetail joints, approximately 1880s based on saw marks and nail composition," he recited, his voice steady even as his hands trembled. [264] "Hardware is period-appropriate brass." [268]

"But what's inside matter?" [272] Sarah asked, impatient. [275]

He lifted the lid carefully. [280] Nested in straw lay six glass bottles, their contents dark and labeled in faded German script. [296] His heart accelerated. [299] He'd seen these before, or thought he had, in a Stuttgart flea market between tour stops in '89. [317]

"They're medicine bottles," he began, then stopped. [324] Was he certain? [327] Could he be certain about anything anymore? [334] The Ming vase had looked perfect too—right weight, appropriate crazing, convincing patina. [346] He'd recited facts then with the same confidence he'd had adjusting feedback loops and soldering cable connections, when his hands knew truth through touch and sound. [370]

"Marcus?" [371] Sarah's voice echoed in the metal space, valley-deep with concern. [381]

He picked up one bottle, held it to the weak afternoon light. [393] The glass showed irregular bubbles, hand-blown. [400] The label's typeface matched 1890s pharmaceutical standards. [408] But so could a forgery. [413] So could anything, if someone wanted it badly enough. [423]

"I need to wrest some meaning from this," he said quietly, surprising himself with honesty. [438] "After the applause dies, after everyone goes home, you're left with what's real and what you pretended was real." [457] He set the bottle down. [462] "On stage, with the band, I knew my purpose. [472] I kept the sound clean, kept the show running. [482] Then I tried to reinvent myself, learn antiques, become someone educated instead of just skilled." [497] He gestured at the grille cloth. [504] "But I brought facts to something that needs feeling. [514] That needs the same instinct I had when I knew a speaker was about to blow just from its vibration." [533]

Sarah sat on the desk edge. [540] "So what do your instincts say?" [547]

Marcus closed his eyes, held the bottle again. [555] It felt right—weight, temperature, the way the glass had aged. [567] Not certain, but true in a way facts couldn't capture. [578] "They're genuine," he said. [582] "Worth maybe two thousand dollars total." [588] He opened his eyes. [592] "And I'm done being confidently uncertain. [598] I'm just going to trust what I feel, even if I fail again." [612]

The grille cloth twisted slowly in the draft, and Marcus heard it—an echo of purpose, faint but returning, like the last reverb after the lights come up. [636] Not applause, not anymore. [641] Something quieter. [643] Something that might sustain him through the silence ahead, in this cold trailer at the edge of an empty quarry, where things were broken down to discover what they'd always been. [673]
