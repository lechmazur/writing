The viaduct glowed amber beneath Kael's boots, wet stone catching the last defiant rays of a dying sun. [17] She stood at the arch's apex, where rain still beaded on ancient mortar, and felt gravity loosen its claim on her bones. [38] This was her curse and gift: she existed between the drop and the ripple, suspended in that infinite moment before consequence arrived. [61]

The clay tablet felt warm against her palm despite the evening chill. [73] She'd found it lodged in the viaduct's cornerstone, its surface crawling with runes that shifted like living things. [91] Each time she tried to read them, the symbols rearranged themselves into new configurations, as if generated by some cosmic algorithm she couldn't quite grasp. [114]

"Show me," she whispered. [118] The runes pulsed, and suddenly she was falling upward. [127]

Kael had learned to navigate her condition through retracing—walking the same paths repeatedly until she understood how time folded around her presence. [149] Each retrace revealed new details, like a procedurally generated landscape that grew richer with every iteration. [165] The viaduct had appeared different each of the seventeen times she'd crossed it today: sometimes moss-covered, sometimes pristine, occasionally fractured by veins of light that suggested futures not yet collapsed into being. [193]

But this time felt different. [198] The tablet thrummed with recognition. [203]

She'd spent three years learning to defy gravity, to slip sideways through moments others experienced linearly. [219] Yet freedom from physical laws had only revealed a deeper prison. [231] The labyrinth wasn't external—it was the maze of her own fragmented self, scattered across timelines that refused to converge. [251]

Every version of Kael existed simultaneously: the child who'd first felt gravity's grip weaken during a storm, the teenager who'd learned to walk on walls, the woman who now stood nowhere and everywhere at once. [283] To conquer the labyrinth of self, she needed to gather these fragments, to retrace every divergent path until she understood which choices had splintered her across probability itself. [310]

The runes suddenly aligned into clarity. [316] They weren't instructions—they were a map of her own timeline, branching and re-branching like neural pathways. [332] Each symbol represented a moment of choice, a fork where she'd simultaneously taken every option, creating new Kaels in procedurally generated realities. [352]

She pressed her thumb against the deepest rune. [360] The viaduct shattered into light. [365]

Suddenly she was everywhere she'd ever been: falling from the oak tree at seven, suspended above her mother's grave at nineteen, floating through the carnival where she'd first kissed someone who tasted like cotton candy and regret. [399] Each memory blazed bright and then darkened at the edges, a brightening darkness that hurt to perceive. [417] This was the truth of being periodically eternal—you didn't escape time; you experienced all of it at once, forever and never. [439]

But now she could see the pattern. [446] The procedural generation wasn't random. [451] Each timeline branched according to her deepest fears, creating infinite variations of running away. [465] The labyrinth of self was built from her own cowardice. [476]

Kael began to retrace deliberately, following the map backward through her fractured lives. [489] Where timelines diverged, she chose the harder path—the conversation not avoided, the grief not escaped, the love not abandoned. [508] With each choice, a fragment rejoined her. [515] She felt herself becoming heavier, more singular, as gravity reasserted its claim. [527]

The viaduct reformed around her, solid and singular for the first time in years. [541] Rain had stopped, and the stones no longer glowed with temporal uncertainty. [553] The tablet crumbled to dust in her hand, its purpose fulfilled. [564]

Kael's feet settled firmly on wet stone. [571] She felt the full weight of her body, the ache in her knees, the chill of evening air. [590] Gravity held her like an old friend welcoming her home. [601]

She was no longer scattered across infinite maybes. [609] She was here, now, whole—one woman walking forward on a rain-slicked bridge toward whatever came next, unafraid of the ripple she would make. [633]
