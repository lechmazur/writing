The carousel horses had stopped turning three years ago, but Mira still heard their phantom music echoing through the abandoned carnival ship's corridors. [25] She pressed her palm against the salt-crusted porthole, watching fog roll across the bay like erasing fingers, rewriting the coastline with each pass. [49] Her twin brother Soren materialized beside her—or rather, the memory of him did, though lately she couldn't tell which version was real. [72]

"You're holding it wrong," he said, gesturing at the emerald swatch card in her trembling hand. [88] The card, once part of a fortune-teller's deck abandoned in the ship's rusted hull, had become her compass through fragmenting time. [109] Its color shifted between jade and viridian depending on which memory she inhabited, a phenomenon she'd learned to trust more than her own recollections. [133]

Mira had discovered they were chimera twins six months before the ship began drifting—two souls split imperfectly at conception, each carrying fragments of the other's DNA, each bleeding into the other's consciousness. [165] The doctors called it blissfully aberrant, this genetic tangle that let them share thoughts and sensations. [181] But the doctors hadn't warned her what would happen when Soren died, how his memories would continue colonizing hers, rewriting her past as if he'd never left. [208]

The carnival ship groaned, listing slightly to starboard. [216] Mira had come here seeking unkindled solace—that peculiar comfort found in abandoned places where joy once lived but never would again. [238] Here, amid the peeling paint and corroded metal, she felt simultaneously trapped and free, caught between what was and what might have been. [261]

She followed the emerald card's instructions, walking through narrative threads that Soren had left behind. [276] His jacket hung on a broken bumper car. [285] His handwriting marked the wall beside the ticket booth: "The garden remembers what we forget." [300] She'd read those words a hundred times, but today they rearranged themselves, the letters dancing into new configurations. [319] Was this what he'd always written, or was the present reaching backward, altering what had been? [336]

The garden of forgotten names—that's what Soren had called it in his final weeks, when the tumor pressed against his temporal lobe and made him speak in riddles. [365] He'd insisted it was real, a place where all discarded identities gathered, where the selves we'd abandoned could finally rest. [387] Mira had dismissed it as delirium then, but now, feeling her memories shift and reform like the fog outside, she understood. [408]

The carnival ship's lower deck held the funhouse mirrors, and Mira descended carefully, the emerald card glowing brighter. [426] In the mirrors, she saw not reflections but variations—herself at seven, at fifteen, at twenty-three, each version slightly different depending on which memories were currently true. [453] In one mirror, Soren stood beside her, solid and breathing. [464] In another, she was alone, had always been alone, an only child inventing an imaginary brother to fill the silence. [485]

"You have to recapture it," Soren's voice echoed from somewhere within her skull. [498] "Not me—the truth. [502] Before it drifts too far out." [508]

She understood finally. [511] The garden of forgotten names wasn't a place but a process—the moment before memory calcified into history, when everything remained fluid and negotiable. [534] The carnival ship drifted in that threshold space, trapped between bay and ocean, past and present, truth and revision. [554]

Mira held up the emerald swatch card, watching it catch the dim light filtering through fog. [570] Through its translucent surface, she could see all the narrative threads at once—every version of her history, every way Soren lived or died or never existed at all. [597]

She chose the thread that hurt least and pulled. [607]

The ship shuddered, and somewhere in the distance, the carousel began to turn again. [622] In this version of the story, Soren had left her the card deliberately, a map to this place where she could hold all their contradictions at once—chimera twins forever, trapped in the freedom of stories that refused to settle into single truths. [664]

The fog lifted slightly, revealing not the shore but another ship, then another, an entire fleet of abandoned vessels holding their own forgotten names. [690]

Mira stepped forward into the garden, finally home. [698]
