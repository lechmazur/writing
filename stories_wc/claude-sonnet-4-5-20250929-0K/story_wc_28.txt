The plaza had survived three empires, but the great fire left it exposed beneath a sky fractured like broken glass. [20] Layla knelt on the ancient stones, her augmented fingers tracing the chipped patterns of a mosaic stepping stone that had once adorned a minaret before the flames brought everything down. [52] The tessera—a single blue tile fragment no larger than her thumb—pulsed with captured time, and through it she fell backward into memory that wasn't hers. [78]

She saw the plaza as it had been: merchants calling out prices, children dancing around fountains now reduced to rubble, the minaret towering overhead with its spiral of geometric perfection. [108] Then the soldiers came, and Layla watched—trapped in this retrocognitive loop as she had been for months—as they forced everyone to kneel. [131] The commander raised his hand, and she knew what would follow: the fire, the screaming, the sky itself seeming to crack from the heat. [154]

"Not again," she whispered, pulling herself free with effort that left her shaking. [167] Her mechanical hands, gifts from the regime she'd once served, clicked softly as they cooled. [183] She had been their weapon, their perfect soldier, until the day she'd been ordered to burn this very plaza. [203] She had refused—an act of aberrant mercy that should have cost her life. [218] Instead, they'd done something worse: bound her consciousness to the tiles, forcing her to relive the atrocity endlessly, a punishment disguised as preservation. [244]

But Layla had learned to read the patterns. [252] Each chip in the mosaic, each crack in the tessera, told a story of resistance. [268] The plaza had been renamed seven times by seven conquerors, each trying to erase what came before. [286] Yet the stones remembered everything, and so would she. [296]

She gathered the fragments carefully, arranging them according to the method her grandmother had taught her—before the regime, before the fire, before everything turned to ash and iron. [325] The chipped patterns formed words in an alphabet the authorities had banned. [338] Names. [339] Real names, not the sanitized labels stamped onto official records. [349]

"Mikhail ibn Rashid," she read aloud, her voice carrying across the empty plaza with warm coldness, a gentleness edged in steel. [370] "Yara of the Eastern Gardens. [376] Samir the Baker. [379] Chen Wei-Long." [381] Each name she spoke aloud fractured the retrocognitive trap a little more. [394] The regime had tried to erase these people, to make their deaths meaningless, but Layla would remake them through remembrance. [413]

Her hands—these instruments of destruction—now cradled each tessera as if it were a child. [429] This was her gentle radicalism: to weaponize empathy against those who had forged her into their tool. [447] They had given her arms of steel to destroy; she would use them to preserve. [463]

The sky flickered above, its fractured dome revealing stars that had watched civilizations rise and fall. [479] Layla placed the last tessera in position, completing the pattern. [490] The mosaic now formed a new name—not for the plaza, but for what would grow here. [508]

"Memorial of Unbroken Names," she declared, and something shifted in the air. [521] The retrocognitive loop loosened its grip. [528] She could feel time moving forward again, no longer an endless spiral into the past. [544]

From the ruins, others emerged—survivors who had been hiding, waiting for someone to name what had been lost. [563] They gathered around Layla and her mosaic, adding their own fragments, speaking their own names. [579]

The regime would come for her eventually. [586] They always did. [589] But beneath this shattered sky, in this ancient plaza marked by fire and remembering, Layla had created something they couldn't burn: a tessera-studded testament that mercy, however aberrant, could still reshape the world through the simple act of naming the dead and honoring what endured. [631]

Her steel hands held the final piece—a blue fragment from the minaret that had called the faithful to prayer centuries before conquest, before fire, before forgetting. [657] She pressed it into place, and the plaza remembered itself whole. [669]
