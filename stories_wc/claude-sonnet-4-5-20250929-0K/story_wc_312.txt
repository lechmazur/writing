The sapphire viaduct stretched across the chasm like a frozen river of light, its crystalline surface catching the first pale rays of dawn. [24] Emris stood at its midpoint, the broken ship's bell clutched against his chest, watching condensation form on the underside of the ancient stone arch above. [50] Drop by drop, the water fell in a rhythm he'd been studying for three weeks now—seven drops per minute from the northern span, eleven from the southern. [78]

The fishing villages below had caught their last fish six months ago. [90] The ocean had simply stopped yielding, as if some fundamental equation had been corrupted. [104] The elders said the world was unbalancing, tilting toward an ending no one could name. [119] But Emris believed he understood why. [125]

He was what the other mages called lukewarm—his magic neither hot enough to forge nor cold enough to preserve, existing in that tepid middle ground where most practitioners gave up entirely. [155] His mentor had suggested he become a clerk. [164] But Emris possessed something more valuable than raw power: he noticed things. [176] The dripping rates, for instance. [181] How they corresponded to the tide tables from before the fish vanished. [193] How they changed when he held the ship's bell at different angles. [206]

The bell had washed ashore three days after the last catch, its clapper broken off, its bronze surface covered in barnacles that spelled out letters in no language he recognized. [236] Or rather, letters that rearranged themselves depending on the light. [247] At dawn, they formed something almost readable. [255]

Emris was earnestly naive in ways that made his colleagues wince. [267] He believed that devotion could substitute for talent, that trying hard enough could bend the universe's laws. [284] He'd spent his modest savings on charts and measuring instruments, filling notebooks with drop patterns and bell resonances. [302] His devotion was brittle, he knew—one more failure might shatter it completely—but he couldn't stop. [318]

The cosmic imbalance wasn't random. [323] He'd figured that much out. [329] The ocean had been taking for millennia—fish, ships, sailors, prayers. [340] Now it was full, oversaturated, like a sponge that couldn't absorb another drop. [353] The dripping water wasn't condensation at all. [361] It was the sea trying to give something back, leaking through the viaduct's ancient stones. [376]

The bell was a key, though broken. [384] And Emris was going to rebuild it. [392]

He'd learned that his lukewarm magic, so useless for dramatic spells, was perfect for delicate work. [408] He could heat bronze just enough to make it malleable without melting it. [422] He could cool it slowly enough to prevent cracks. [432] For two months, he'd been collecting the dripped water in consecrated bowls, understanding how each drop carried a fraction of the ocean's debt. [453]

Now, as dawn fully broke and the viaduct blazed with refracted light, Emris began. [468] He'd fashioned a new clapper from melted-down fishing hooks, donated by villagers who thought him mad but couldn't afford disbelief. [487] His hands moved steadily, applying heat in measured pulses, letting the metal remember its purpose. [502]

The reconstruction took hours. [506] His magic guttered and flared, never quite sufficient, always barely enough. [518] But he understood the dripping rates, understood that consistency mattered more than intensity. [531] Seven drops, eleven drops, the pattern holding as he worked. [542]

When he finally lifted the restored bell and struck it, the sound rippled across the viaduct like a physical force. [561] The dripping water reversed direction, flowing upward into the bell's hollow core, then outward in a fine mist that sparkled with impossible colors. [583]

Below, in the villages, fishermen would later report that the ocean began yielding again at that precise moment. [601] Not abundantly—the imbalance would take years to fully correct—but enough. [612] A plausible impossibility: that one lukewarm mage with brittle devotion and earnest naivety could matter. [627]

Emris hung the bell from the viaduct's center span, where it would ring with each drip. [644] Seven and eleven, the rhythm of the world relearning balance. [655] He walked home as the sun climbed higher, his shadow stretching long across sapphire stone, his magic exhausted but his devotion, somehow, no longer brittle at all. [681]
