The natural history illustrator known as Vera climbed the final ladder to the rooftop canal system, her leather satchel heavy with specimen jars and charcoal sticks. [27] Between the bronze towers of the sleeping city, water flowed in elevated aqueducts, reflecting the giant's slow, rhythmic breathing that vibrated through every stone. [50] According to the old chroniclers, the giant beneath the city napped for exactly seven hours—time enough for her task, if she moved carefully. [74]

Around her neck hung an infinity symbol pendant, passed down from her mentor. [88] It was no mere ornament but a key to her peculiar gift: the ability to sculpt time itself. [108] By borrowing minutes from one moment and grafting them onto another, Vera could stretch a single second into an hour, or compress a day into a heartbeat. [136] But every manipulation left a mark, an interrupted cadence in the world's natural rhythm, like a musical phrase that never quite resolved. [158] She'd learned to feel these temporal scars, the places where time limped rather than flowed. [175]

Today she sought something more elusive than any butterfly or rare orchid she'd ever illustrated. [191] She wanted to find the place where echoes are born. [202]

Her mentor had whispered of it once, delirious with fever before death claimed him. [217] "Between the towers, where water catches breath before falling," he'd said. [229] "That's where sound remembers itself, where the first echo learns to speak." [242] For a natural history illustrator, such a discovery would be like finding the original template from which all living things were copied. [265]

Vera walked the narrow stone paths beside the canals, listening. [276] The giant's breathing created a bass note that thrummed through everything, but within it she detected subtle variations—frequencies that didn't quite match, temporal hiccups where the sound folded back on itself. [308] An interrupted cadence, she realized. [313] Time here was already wounded, already limping. [320]

She touched her pendant and began her work. [328] Carefully, she borrowed five minutes from the giant's third hour of sleep and wove them into the present moment, stretching the now into a gossamer thing. [355] The water in the canals slowed to syrup. [364] Droplets hung suspended, and in their stillness, she heard it—a sound trapped between the instant of utterance and the moment of reflection. [388]

A caged bird sang from a nearby tower window, its melody crystallizing in the thickened air. [405] Vera moved toward it, following the sound's ghost as it bounced between bronze walls. [420] There, in a narrow gap between two aqueducts, she saw it: a shimmering pocket of space where the bird's song met itself coming back. [445] The echo wasn't born after the sound—it was born with it, twin and original, locked together like the loops of her infinity pendant. [470]

She reached out, and her fingers touched something that felt like silk made of memory. [486] The echo was caged here, trapped in this moment by the architecture and the giant's steady breath and the weight of borrowed time she'd laid upon the world. [516]

To understand it, to illustrate it truthfully, she would need to uncage it. [530]

Vera gathered the stolen minutes back, releasing them to flow naturally again. [542] Time snapped forward, and the echo burst free, rippling outward in visible waves. [556] She watched, sketching frantically as the phenomenon unfolded—the way sound split itself like a cell dividing, how each echo carried memory of its origin while becoming something new. [586]

The bird's song multiplied across the rooftops, a thousand voices born from one. [600]

Below, the giant stirred slightly in sleep, dreaming perhaps of music. [612]

Vera smiled, her illustration complete. [617] She had borrowed time and sculpted it into revelation, had found the birthplace of all echoes and set them free. [638] The interrupted cadences would heal eventually, the temporal scars fading like bruises. [651] Her pendant grew warm against her chest, the infinity symbol glowing faintly with spent power. [667]

She descended before the giant woke, carrying proof that some mysteries weren't meant to stay caged, that truth required liberation to be truly seen. [691]
