The library hung suspended between cloudbanks, its ice-hewn shelves catching the pale glow of dawn like captured starlight. [18] Miren pressed her gloved palm against a frosted window, watching the lunar eclipse fade into morning—the fifth one this month, each darkening lasting longer than natural law allowed. [48] As a lunar-eclipse locksmith, she repaired the mechanisms that regulated celestial movements, but lately, every lock she opened revealed deeper fractures in the world's foundations. [74]

She moved through aisles where books crystallized into sculptures, their pages too frozen to turn without shattering. [92] Under the soft hush of a distant morning, wind whispered through cracks in the ancient architecture, carrying fragments of forgotten songs. [113] This place reminded her of driftwood—something once vital, now bleached by time and circumstance, beautiful in its decay. [132]

Her fingers found the corner shelf where prophecies lay scattered like shed skin. [146] These weren't grand pronouncements but scraps—margin notes in almanacs, corrections penciled into star charts, confessions tucked between recipe cards. [167] Through scraps of prophecy hidden in a library's corner, she'd been piecing together why the eclipses multiplied, why time itself seemed to stutter and repeat. [193]

The answer pointed here: to the Hall of Mirrors deep within the library's frozen heart. [210]

Miren descended spiral stairs where ice reflected ice reflected ice, each surface throwing back distorted versions of her lantern's flame. [231] The Hall wasn't a room but a corridor of facing mirrors that created infinite recession, and somewhere in that endlessness lived the master mechanism—the device that once kept celestial rhythms synchronized with earthly time. [265]

She found it between two mirrors, existing in the space that shouldn't exist: a framework of interconnected gears, hauntingly bright against the dimness, glowing with captured moonlight. [291] Each gear tooth was etched with lunar phases, and the largest wheel bore the face of every eclipse recorded in human memory. [313]

But three gears had stopped. [318] Rust furred their edges like orange moss. [326]

Miren uncapped her toolkit, the brass clasp clicking in the silence. [338] Inside lay her clockmaker's gear assortment—inherited from her grandmother, who'd been a temporal mechanic before the profession faded into legend. [360] Each replacement gear was cut from fallen meteors, their metal remembering the vacuum of space, the patient turning of heavenly bodies. [382]

She'd come to learn the rhythm of repair, not just the mechanical sequence but the deeper music beneath it. [402] Locks and clocks were cousins; both measured thresholds, both required understanding what wanted to open and what needed to stay closed. [424]

The first gear slipped into place with a satisfying click. [435] Through the mirrors, infinite Mirens performed the same motion, creating a chorus of small mechanical prayers. [452] The second gear proved stubborn—its housing had warped from neglect. [463] She heated her smallest pick over the lantern until it glowed, then carefully persuaded the metal back into true. [483]

The third gear was missing entirely, consumed by whatever force was fracturing reality. [497]

Miren studied her assortment. [501] None matched exactly, but repair was always translation—finding what could serve where perfection was impossible. [517] She selected a gear cut from the Perseids meteor shower, its teeth slightly irregular, and filed it down with rhythmic scrapes that echoed like meditation. [542]

When she fitted the final piece, the mechanism shuddered. [551] The hauntingly bright glow intensified, spreading through the mirror corridor until every reflection blazed with moonlight. [568] The gears began to turn—slowly, then with gathering confidence. [578]

Outside the library's windows, the eclipse completed its retreat. [588] The moon emerged whole and silver, resuming its proper station. [599]

Miren packed her tools, listening to the mechanism's steady tick. [610] The rhythm was imperfect, slightly syncopated, but alive. [619] Perhaps perfection wasn't the point. [625] Perhaps the world's mechanisms, like driftwood, grew more beautiful for having survived their fractures. [640]

She climbed back through the frozen aisles, leaving the Hall of Mirrors to its infinite watch. [657] The prophecy scraps had promised nothing beyond this: that someone would remember how to listen, how to match broken rhythms with patient hands. [681]

As she stepped into the morning, the clouds below parted to reveal distant oceans, their waves catching light like gear teeth meshing with the sky. [705] Somewhere, other mechanisms waited for repair. [712] Other eclipses would come, and she would be ready, carrying her grandmother's tools and the knowledge that time, like moonlight, could be coaxed back into beauty. [737]
