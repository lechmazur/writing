The floating rock tea ceremony platform hung suspended between two mountain peaks, anchored by chains so old their iron had turned silver with enchantment. [26] Mira knelt before the stone table, her crow quill trimmed tip resting beside the ancient rune manuscript, and tried to steady her breathing. [50] The air held that peculiar quality her grandmother used to call "a breath between storms"—the saturated hush before everything changed. [72]

Her hands had begun to crystallize again. [79] The stress response she'd inherited from her father's bloodline meant that whenever fear gripped her, her fingers turned to translucent quartz, rigid and useless. [103] She watched the transformation creep across her knuckles like frost on winter glass. [117]

The manuscript before her contained the Shedding Runes, symbols that could help a person release what no longer served them. [137] Mira had spent three years studying at the Archives, learning to read the old language, preparing for this moment. [156] The scars on her arms—some from childhood accidents, others from the fire that had taken her parents—pulsed beneath her sleeves. [178] She had come to this sacred platform not to erase them, but to transform scars into stories, to give them meaning beyond mere pain. [203]

But first, she needed her hands. [209]

Closing her eyes, Mira remembered her grandmother's voice: "When the stones take you, child, remember the small magics." [227] She had dismissed those teachings as youthful superstitions back then, before the Academy, before she understood that scholarly knowledge was only half the picture. [251] Her grandmother would knock on wood three times before difficult conversations, would whisper to the moon when seeking clarity, would trace protective circles in salt around the garden. [277]

Mira knocked three times on the stone table. [285] The sound echoed across the chasm. [292]

She whispered to the wind: "I am not my fear." [303]

With her left hand—still flesh, still warm—she traced a circle on the platform's surface. [319]

The crystallization paused. [322] Then, gradually, it began to reverse. [329] Her fingers softened, blood returning to transparent stone, warming it back into skin and bone. [345] Mira flexed them carefully, testing, then lifted the crow quill trimmed tip. [358]

The quill had belonged to her mother, who had been a keeper of stories before the fire. [376] Its tip had been precisely cut to hold ink without dripping, perfect for the delicate work of rune transcription. [396]

Mira dipped it into the tea she'd prepared—not to drink, but to write. [411] Tea ceremony on the floating platforms wasn't about consumption but transformation, the liquid serving as a bridge between intention and reality. [432]

She began to trace the first Shedding Rune onto her forearm, directly over the oldest scar. [449] The symbol flowed from the quill like liquid moonlight, settling into her skin. [463] This rune meant "the breaking that allows growth." [472] As she completed it, the scar beneath began to pulse with soft light. [487]

In the held breath between one heartbeat and the next, she saw the memory: herself at seven, reaching for the high shelf, the pot of boiling water falling. [515] But now she saw past the pain to what came after—her grandmother's gentle hands, the healing songs, the patience she'd learned from weeks of recovery. [541]

That scar had taught her to ask for help. [551]

She moved to the next scar, drawing the rune for "what the flames could not take." [569] This one showed her parents' faces, not burning but laughing, teaching her to read her first runes by candlelight. [589]

One by one, she shed the weight of each wound while keeping its wisdom. [604] The scars remained visible, but they no longer ached with unanswered questions. [617] They had become a text she could read, a manuscript written in flesh and experience. [633]

When the last rune was complete, the first drops of rain began to fall. [649] The breath between storms was ending. [656] Mira corked her tea-ink, cleaned her mother's quill, and carefully rolled the manuscript. [671]

She stood, no longer a budding rune scholar but something more—a living text, a story that had learned to read itself. [694] As she walked toward the chain-path leading home, her hands remained steady, warm, and blessedly human. [711] Behind her, thunder rolled across the mountains, but she was no longer afraid of storms. [727] She had learned that everything—even fear, even loss—could be transformed if you knew the right symbols, the right small magics, the right way to hold your breath and begin again. [761]
