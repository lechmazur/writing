The velvet observatory smelled of honeysuckle and old starlight, its domed ceiling open to the midsummer sky. [17] Elena pressed her palms against the transparent violin, feeling the ice crystal hum beneath her fingertips. [33] As a provenance researcher, she'd authenticated countless artifacts, but this instrument defied every logical timeline she knew. [49]

The ferns along the observatory's curved walls whispered their usual gossip—*careful, careful, the roots remember*—directly into her mind. [67] She'd stopped being surprised by the accidental telepathy six months ago, around the same time she'd discovered she could read futures in the dregs of her morning coffee. [93]

This morning's cup had shown her everything: the violin dissolving at dawn, taking with it the only proof that the Kellerman Empire had stolen its greatest cultural treasures from the mountain monasteries. [123] Her report was due before sunrise, before the promise she'd made to the monks lost its glow, before their faith in justice turned to ash. [148]

"Show me," she whispered to the violin, and lifted it to her shoulder. [161]

The bow was carved from the same impossible ice, never melting despite the summer heat. [176] When she drew it across the strings, the sound that emerged wasn't music but memory—a perforated destiny, punched through with holes where choices had been stolen, where histories had been rewritten by imperial scholars with clever pens and empty consciences. [216]

The pothos vine above the telescope *felt* it too, sending down a tendril that brushed her hair. [233] *Propagate the truth*, it urged. [239] *Seeds know how to break through concrete*. [246]

Elena set down the violin and retrieved her coffee cup from the brass observation table. [261] She'd learned the method by accident, staring at rings and drips during a sleepless night last winter. [278] Now she swirled the last drops, watching the dark liquid pattern itself against white porcelain. [293]

There: two futures branching like arterial paths. [300] In one, she filed her report confirming the violin's monastic origin, watched the Empire's lawyers bury it in appeals, saw the artifact melt before any court could rule. [326] The monks would have their truth acknowledged and ignored—a victory that tasted like defeat. [341]

In the other path, she lied. [347] Called the violin a modern forgery, released it from the Empire's climate-controlled vault back to the mountains. [363] The monks could hide it in their sacred caves where winter never ended, where ice crystal sang to ice crystal in frequencies that made glaciers weep. [388] But her career would end, her credibility shattered. [396] She'd spend the rest of her life weighing that dream against an empire's reputation, wondering if truth served through lies could ever balance the scales. [420]

The mulberry bush outside the dome—planted, ironically, by an imperial botanist a century ago—pressed its consciousness against hers. [438] Its ache was old and deep, roots wrapped around the observatory's foundation, purple fruit staining the white marble year after year. [459] *We persist*, it told her. [464] *We propagate in impossible places*. [469]

Elena looked at the violin again, its crystalline structure refracting midsummer moonlight into spectral colors across the velvet walls. [486] Inside its transparent body, she could see the tiny imperfections, the deliberate holes that let certain notes escape while trapping others. [505] A perforated destiny was still a destiny. [512] Perhaps truth worked the same way—some of it had to escape, to scatter like seeds, to take root in unexpected soil. [533]

She opened her laptop and began to type, fingers flying across keys. [545] Her report would be immaculate, detailed, irrefutable—and she would encrypt it, send copies to seventeen different monasteries, three investigative journalists, and a network of provenance researchers she'd been quietly cultivating like a garden. [577] Then she'd submit the official version to the Empire, stripped of its most damaging details, buying time. [593]

The violin would melt at dawn. [599] But the truth, like the mulberry's seeds, like the ferns' spores, like every persistent growing thing the plants kept teaching her about—the truth would propagate in the dark places where empires couldn't reach. [631] She had until sunrise, before her promise lost its glow. [641]

Elena smiled and kept typing, the ice crystal violin singing softly behind her, already beginning to weep. [657]
