The gorge had worn its name honestly for three centuries, swallowing every sound and returning it transformed. [16] Kael descended the limestone switchbacks in the hush of a hidden sunrise, when fog still clung to the chasm walls and the first light struggled through in pale threads. [44] She carried the crocodile's tooth on a leather cord around her neck—a compass of sorts, though it pointed toward grief rather than north. [67]

As a lost soul collector, she pursued what others fled: the lingering dead who couldn't release their final breaths, their spectral confessions. [88] Echo Gorge held dozens, their voices trapped in the stone's memory, repeating traumas in endless loops. [104] Most collectors worked in silence, but Kael had discovered something her guild considered heretical—that laughter, woven carefully into the work, could transform collection into genuine healing. [129]

Her fingers found the harp strapped across her back. [138] The instrument had been damaged in a rockslide years ago, its frame subtly warped, its strings never quite true. [157] Through the distorted notes of this misaligned harp, she'd learned to match the frequency of trapped souls, to harmonize with their pain rather than simply extract it. [182]

The crocodile's tooth grew warm against her sternum. [190] Close now. [192]

She rounded an outcropping and found him: a young man's shade, translucent in the dawn, crouched at the gorge's narrowest point. [211] His mouth moved in constant confession, words she couldn't yet hear. [222] The stone around him bore scorch marks—old pain, burned deep. [233]

Kael settled cross-legged on the path, modestly fearless in the way of those who've faced death enough to know its textures. [253] She wasn't brave in the bold sense; she simply understood that fear served no purpose here. [269] The dead needed presence, not bravado. [275]

She plucked the first string. [280] The note emerged crooked, sharp where it should have been soft. [292] The shade's head snapped toward her. [298]

"I killed them," he said, voice suddenly clear, and the gorge caught his words, threw them back. [315] *Killed them, killed them, killed them.* [321]

Kael played another note, then another, building a melody through the harp's deliberate wrongness. [335] The distortion created spaces between the notes, gaps where new truths could breathe. [348]

"Tell me," she said, and continued playing. [355]

The confession spilled out: a fire, a family, a door he couldn't reach in time. [370] The gorge echoed each detail, layering his guilt until the air grew thick with it. [386] This was the crucial moment—where most collectors would simply pull the soul free, storing it for processing, filing it away like a specimen. [409]

Instead, Kael shifted her melody. [414] She found the absurdity first—how he'd been carrying a birthday cake when the smoke alarm went off, how he'd slipped on dropped frosting three times trying to reach the stairs. [441] Her fingers danced across the warped strings, and she began to laugh, soft and genuine. [457]

"A cake," she said, playing through the words. [465] "You were carrying a cake." [470]

The shade stared at her. [475] The gorge caught her laughter, sent it back transformed—not mockery, but something luminous, aching with recognition of how tragedy and mundanity forever tangle. [498]

"Pink frosting," the shade whispered, and something broke in his voice. [509] "Strawberry. [510] My daughter's favorite." [513]

Kael played faster, the harp's misalignment creating harmonics that shouldn't exist, frequencies that reached into the space between life and lingering. [533] She laughed again, tears on her cheeks now, because the gorge was throwing back the daughter's name, and the shade was beginning to remember not just death but the years of birthday mornings before it. [566]

The crocodile's tooth flared hot—a predator's instinct recognizing the moment. [576] Kael stood, still playing, and the shade rose with her. [587] In the growing light, he was becoming translucent, but his face had softened. [600]

"She'd have laughed too," he said. [606] "About the frosting." [609]

"She did," Kael said gently, watching him fade. [617] "In another way. [621] That's what we remember." [625]

The gorge fell silent. [629] The soul had released itself, integrated and healed rather than merely collected. [641] Kael touched the cooling tooth at her throat, shouldered her broken harp, and continued her descent into the waking canyon, pursuing the next luminous ache. [665]
