The greenhouse roof had buckled during the flood three weeks ago, and now Helena crouched among shattered glass and waterlogged tomato plants, searching for what remained of her collection. [30] As a neutron star researcher, she spent her working hours contemplating objects so dense that a teaspoon would weigh a billion tons, yet here she was, on her knees in mud, mourning the loss of something infinitesimally light. [66]

The butterflies were gone, of course. [72] The monarchs she'd been raising had either drowned or escaped through the torn panels overhead. [88] But scattered across the workbench, mixed with soil and broken pottery, were traces of their presence: dust from butterfly wings, iridescent scales catching the gray morning light like microscopic mirrors. [118]

Helena had always preprocessed reality, as her ex-husband used to say. [130] She couldn't help filtering experience through layers of analysis before feeling it. [143] When their marriage ended, she'd made spreadsheets. [151] When her mother died, she'd catalogued memories by decade. [161] The butterflies had been different, though—a hobby chosen specifically because it demanded presence, attention to gradual change rather than catastrophic events. [182]

She collected the wing dust carefully with a soft brush, transferring it to a glass slide. [199] Under her portable microscope, the scales revealed their architecture: overlapping shingles of chitin, each one a marvel of biological engineering, their arrangement creating color through light interference rather than pigment. [230] The flood had stripped everything else away—the drama of emergence, the spectacle of migration she'd planned to witness—leaving only this quiet evidence of transformation. [253]

Through accumulated dust patterns, Helena began to see what she'd missed while the butterflies lived. [269] Each scale type clustered in specific areas. [277] She photographed, measured, documented. [281] The ground scales from the wing bases, sturdy and plain. [291] The cover scales that created the orange warning coloration. [301] The androconial scales from the males, modified for dispersing pheromones. [312] Every butterfly left behind a record of its existence, as precise as the decay curves she plotted for rotating stellar remnants. [333]

The comparison wasn't frivolous. [337] Neutron stars were themselves evidence of catastrophe, the collapsed cores of exploded suns. [351] She studied their gradual spin-down, the way they shed rotational energy over millennia through magnetic fields and particle winds. [371] Decay was just transformation observed patiently. [378] The universe was always losing something to become something else. [389]

Helena had wanted the butterflies to strip needless drama from her life, to teach her appreciation of incremental beauty. [408] Instead, the flood had done the stripping, and the butterflies—or what remained of them—were teaching her something more subtle. [428]

She spent the afternoon arranging the scales on slides, creating a systematic record. [442] Her hands moved with the same precision she brought to analyzing pulsar timing data. [457] But now there was something else beneath the methodology: a kindled humility, warm and unfamiliar. [473] These scales had once powered flight, had carried living creatures through the complicated work of transformation from crawling to soaring. [493] Now they were dust, and yet they still held information, still mattered, still meant something. [509]

By evening, she had documented seventeen distinct scale types across four developmental stages. [523] The greenhouse remained a wreck around her, but she'd built a small island of order on the workbench. [542] Tomorrow she would start repairs. [548] Next spring, she would begin again with caterpillars. [557]

She held the final slide up to the fading light. [568] The scales glowed like stars, each one a tiny mirror reflecting something that no longer existed but had been real, had been beautiful, had mattered in its moment. [596]

Helena understood neutron stars because she'd always understood endings. [606] The butterflies were teaching her about the space between—the gradual changes that didn't announce themselves, the transformations that happened whether you documented them or not, the way light could linger even after its source had moved on. [642]

She carefully stored the slides and locked the greenhouse door. [653] The humid air outside smelled of wet earth and coming rain. [665] More water, more damage, more opportunities for things to fall apart and reveal what they'd been holding all along. [685]

Helena walked home through the dusk, her hands finally steady, her mind quiet. [699] The stars were emerging overhead, including several pulsars she could name from memory. [713] They spun in their perfect decay, patient and constant, leaving trails of light through accumulated time. [730] Just like butterflies. [733] Just like everything that had ever lived and changed and scattered itself across the universe, waiting to be understood. [753]
