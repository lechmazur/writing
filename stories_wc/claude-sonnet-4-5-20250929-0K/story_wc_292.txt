The experimental weather station had been Mira's home for three months, ever since the jet stream shifted and stranded her here on the ice shelf. [28] She stood at the circular window, watching violet clouds twist into impossible geometries, and touched the copper nail in her pocket—the only thing she'd salvaged from her great-grandfather's coffin before the floods claimed the coastal cemetery. [64] As the station's sole map librarian, she'd been sent to catalog historical maritime routes, but the ancestor she'd barely known had led her to something else entirely. [91]

The shipwrecked journals had arrived in a cargo drop, frost-damaged and illegible to everyone but Mira, who recognized the peculiar notation system her great-grandfather had developed for his Arctic expeditions. [118] Between weather observations and supply inventories, she'd discovered coded stanzas—poems that weren't poems at all, but instructions. [136] Instructions for something called reversible exile. [142]

"You seem nervously confident today," Dr. Kao observed, appearing in the doorway with two mugs of synthetic coffee. [159] The climatologist had a habit of reading Mira's moods with unsettling accuracy. [172]

"I think I've decoded another sequence." [178] Mira spread the journals across her desk, their yellowed pages crackling like thin ice. [193] "My great-grandfather wasn't just mapping trade routes. [201] He was documenting places where the boundaries between being and unbeing grew thin—places where exile could be chosen, reversed, chosen again." [222]

Dr. Kao leaned closer, squinting at the archaic handwriting. [231] "That sounds metaphysical, not geographical." [236]

"The weather makes geography metaphysical now," Mira said, gesturing at the window where reality seemed to bend. [252] Since the jet stream's collapse, the station had recorded phenomena that violated every atmospheric model: snow that fell upward, auroras that sang in frequencies that made equipment malfunction, temperatures that existed in negative states beyond absolute zero. [287] "I think he found these places deliberately. [294] I think he was exiled—or exiled himself—and found a way back." [307]

She pulled out the copper nail, watching it catch the strange light. [319] "This was driven through his coffin lid. [327] Old tradition, meant to keep the dead from wandering." [337] Her voice carried the spongey dread that had been building since she'd first understood the journals' true content. [354] "But what if he wanted to wander? [362] What if that was the point?" [369]

Dr. Kao's expression shifted from skepticism to something more unsettled. [379] "Are you suggesting your great-grandfather achieved some kind of voluntary disappearance?" [391]

Mira nodded slowly. [394] "The coded stanzas describe thirteen sites where the world's membrane weakens. [406] Places of extreme cold, extreme isolation. [412] He called them 'wound-doors.'" [416] She traced her finger across a map marked with tiny copper-colored symbols. [429] "One of them is here. [435] Beneath this station." [439]

"That's why you volunteered for this posting." [447] It wasn't a question. [451]

"Everyone thinks he abandoned his family, disappeared like a coward during the first climate wars." [467] Mira's idealism, her need to rehabilitate his memory, burned through her careful academic demeanor. [482] "But he was brave in a way no one understood. [493] He mapped escape routes for a drowning world—ways to step sideways out of catastrophe." [509]

Dr. Kao set down the coffee mugs carefully. [517] "And you want to follow him." [524]

"I want to prove it's possible." [531] Mira held up the nail like a key. [541] "To honor what he discovered. [547] To question everything we assume about permanence and exile." [557] She looked at the journals, at the maps, at the window where the broken weather performed its impossible ballet. [576] "If exile can be reversed, if we can step out of one world and back into another, then maybe we're not as trapped as we think." [601]

The station's instruments began their evening chorus of warnings and measurements. [612] Mira pocketed the copper nail and reached for her thermal gear. [624] The wound-door waited below, in the ice, in the place between staying and leaving. [639] Her great-grandfather had been there first, but she would be the one to bring back proof. [657]

"Coming?" [658] she asked Dr. Kao, nervously confident, already halfway to the airlock. [670]

The climatologist picked up a journal, studying its coded stanzas with new respect. [683] "Someone should document this properly," Dr. Kao said, and followed her into the strange, singing cold. [700]
