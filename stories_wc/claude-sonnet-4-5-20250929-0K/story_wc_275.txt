The tower had fallen three seasons ago, and still the sky rained dust. [13]

Mira knelt in the eastern quarter of the glass-domed enclosure, her fingers working soil around a transplanted desert rose, its coral petals catching the amber light filtered through sand-scratched glass. [40] Her father's ship had landed an hour before dawn, the familiar groan of hydraulics announcing another hunt completed, another fugitive delivered to the regional magistrate. [64] She hadn't gone to meet him. [70]

The dome rose cathedral-high above the farm, a relic from before the tower's collapse, when architects believed humanity could master any landscape. [91] Now it served a quieter purpose. [97] Mira moved between rows of roses, each plant carefully positioned, speaking to them in whispers her father would have mocked—or perhaps had mocked, before she stopped listening. [122]

"You hold what the world forgets," she told a struggling seedling, pressing torn canvas around its base. [139] The fabric was scrap from an old airship ballast sandbag, something she'd found half-buried after the tower's fall scattered commerce vessels across three territories. [163] She'd discovered she could inculcate plants with values if she surrounded them with objects that carried intention, memory, purpose. [183] The roses grown beside ballast scraps learned balance. [191] Those near compass fragments always turned toward true north, no matter how the wind screamed. [206]

Her father entered through the eastern airlock, sand sifting from his coat. [218] Kael was a silhouette of edges—knives at his belt, rifle across his back, the hard geometry of a man who'd built his life on certainty. [242]

"The western beds need culling," he said, sheathing a blade Mira hadn't noticed he'd drawn. [258] He did that sometimes, she'd observed with her senselessly perceptive eye: kept weapons ready even in the only place that might be called home. [281]

"They need patience," Mira replied, not looking up. [289] "Not every weakness requires cutting away." [295]

Kael crouched beside her, and she caught the scent of cordite and exhaustion. [308] "The magistrate's asking about the dome. [315] Says we're wasting resources that could feed refugees." [323]

"These plants feed refugees. [327] Fifty families buy our roses for medicine." [335]

"They want the space, Mira. [340] For housing." [342]

She finally met his eyes—her father's eyes, everyone said, though hers had never learned to harden. [359] "The tower fell because we forgot how to cultivate anything but fear," she said. [373] "I'm weaving continuity through chaos. [378] Someone has to." [381]

The phrase hung between them, engraved quiet in the filtered light. [392] Kael had heard her speak it before, this daughter who'd chosen soil over iron, growth over capture. [409] He'd never understood how watching him drag terrified people across wastelands had transformed her into this—someone who believed in teaching roses to hold steady, in surrounding fragile things with purpose until they internalized strength. [441]

"Your mother grew these," he said finally, touching a mature plant near the entrance. [455] "Before." [456]

"I know." [458] Mira did know, with that uncanny perception that caught every meaningful detail. [470] She knew her mother had started this farm as an anchor when Kael's work grew darker, had whispered to seeds about resilience and hope. [493] She knew her father had buried his grief in contracts after the sickness took her, had convinced himself that capturing the guilty imposed order on an orderless world. [518]

She knew he was lying about the magistrate. [526]

"You want me to give up the farm," she said. [536] "You think if I leave, I'll finally join you. [546] Learn the trade." [549]

Kael's silence was confirmation. [553]

Mira returned to her work, pressing ballast canvas around another seedling. [564] Outside, the wind rose to a tranquil blaze of sand against glass—not violent, but constant, reshaping everything it touched. [584]

"I already learned your trade, Father," she said softly. [593] "I'm just hunting different things. [598] Stay for tea. [601] The roses are blooming, and I've saved you a cutting from Mother's original plant. [615] Something to carry with you, if you want." [623]

She didn't watch him decide. [628] She simply kept planting, kept whispering, kept weaving her careful continuity into soil that would outlast every tower humanity might build or break. [650]

Behind her, she heard the softest sound: her father's blade sliding home into its sheath, staying there. [667]

"Tea sounds good," Kael said. [672]

Through the dome's eastern panels, the first clean light in months broke through the thinning dust. [687]
