The storyteller's copper-veined hands trembled as she traced the diamond's flaw, a dark thread running through its heart like a frozen scream. [25] Her name had been Sarielle in the old tongue, but no one spoke that language anymore—no one except her, and soon, not even that. [51] The towers of bone rose around her like ancient teeth, jutting from the canyon floor where echoes never died, only layered upon themselves in infinite conversation. [77]

She had come here because texture needed translation. [85] Every surface held a story her fingers could read: the rough bark of dead trees, the smooth worry of river stones, the sharp geometry of crystal. [110] But her people, the Velathi, had communicated through touch, and now they were gone. [124] Their language died when the last child who could feel its nuances succumbed to the fever three winters past. [144] Sarielle alone remained, quietly articulate in a tongue no ear could hear. [157]

The diamond was her last hope—flawed, cursed, or so the canyon dwellers claimed. [171] They said it had stolen voices, turned singers mute, made poets forget their words. [185] But Sarielle understood: it didn't steal, it transformed. [194] The flaw wasn't corruption; it was a tunnel of echoes, a passage between one form of expression and another. [213]

She watched the birds—canyon swifts that wheeled above the bone towers in patterns that seemed almost purposeful. [231] For weeks, she had observed them, noting how they moved in response to wind, to the presence of predators, to the quality of light. [254] Their murmurations were another language, written in motion against the sky. [266]

Sarielle held the diamond up to catch the setting sun. [277] Light fractured through its flaw, projecting shadows that danced across the bone towers. [291] The echoes in the canyon responded, creating harmonics she'd never heard before. [304] Her copper veins—the mark of her lineage, metallic threads beneath translucent skin—began to warm. [320]

She pressed the diamond to the tower nearest her, feeling its texture through the stone. [336] Rough where marrow had once been, smooth where time had polished edges. [348] Her fingers read the bone's story: mammoth, ancient, killed by cold rather than tooth or claw. [365] She needed to harness this, to bind texture to sound through the diamond's transformative flaw. [381]

The birds spiraled lower, their pattern tightening. [388] Sarielle realized they were responding to the echoes, which were responding to the light, which was responding to her touch. [408] Everything connected. [410] She began to move her hands across the bone tower in the patterns of Velathi grammar—circular motions for questions, sharp angles for imperatives, flowing curves for poetry. [435]

The diamond grew hot. [439] Through its flawed heart, her touches became sound. [448] Not the crude approximation of spoken language, but something truer: the actual sensation of texture converted to acoustic form. [467] Rough bone sang in grinding bass notes. [475] Smooth hollows hummed with hollow clarity. [482] The sharp edges of broken calcium created staccato bursts like wooden instruments. [494]

The canyon's endless echoes caught each sound and wove them together. [506] The birds wheeled faster, their pattern becoming a visible representation of what she created—a dance that was also a translation, a bridge between touch and hearing, between dead language and living sound. [539]

Sarielle worked through the night, her copper veins blazing with reflected moonlight. [551] She touched every tower within reach, translating the texture of her people's history into sound. [567] The bone towers had witnessed the Velathi's existence; now they would testify to it in a form others could comprehend. [587]

By dawn, the canyon sang with voices made from stone and light and motion. [602] The diamond's curse was broken—or perhaps fulfilled, depending on how one understood transformation. [616] Sarielle's fingers were worn smooth, her copper veins dimmed, but the echoes would never stop speaking. [633]

She set the diamond at the tallest tower's base and walked away. [647] Her language had died, but through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight, through the faithful translation of texture into sound, it would speak forever in the canyon of endless echoes. [683]

The storyteller's work was complete. [688] Even after she was gone, anyone who came to listen would hear not words, but the sensation of meaning itself, rough and smooth and sharp and true. [714]
