The living bridge garden had always existed in three states at once: what it was, what it remembered being, and what it would become when the roots finally won. [30] Lyra walked its moss-slick spans every morning, carrying her surveyor's tools and a leather case of fading photographs that showed hedge mazes she'd never quite finished designing. [58]

She was retrocognitively trapped, the physicians had explained with clinical detachment—her consciousness slipping backward through her own timeline like a stone skipping across water, touching moments already lived, already lost. [87] The photographs helped anchor her: images of labyrinthine gardens she'd created for wealthy clients, their green walls captured in silver halide that yellowed more each day, as if her past were being slowly erased from both memory and matter. [124]

Today she'd come to the garden's heart, where the oldest bridge arched across a ravine choked with flowering vines, seeking the halo fragment. [148] She'd found it three weeks ago—or would find it; time had become unreliable—a curved shard of crystallized light embedded in the bridge's living railings. [174] Local legend claimed it fell from a saint's crown during a battle no history recorded, but Lyra suspected something stranger. [195]

The fragment pulsed as she approached, responding to her peculiar condition. [206] She set down her case and withdrew the photographs, spreading them across the bridge's surface where roots had woven themselves into geometric patterns. [230] Each maze she'd designed had been an attempt to discover the texture of time itself—not its passage, but its substance. [252] What did a moment feel like when you held it? [263] Could you map it, wall it in, force it to reveal its architecture? [277]

The halo fragment blazed brighter. [282] In its glow, Lyra saw her photographs beginning to change. [293] The hedges in the images started growing, their paths shifting into impossible curves that bent back through themselves. [311] She recognized the mathematics immediately: hyperbolic geometry, the kind that existed in spaces where parallel lines diverged infinitely, where triangles contained less than 180 degrees. [335]

Her hands trembling in quaking reverie, she touched the fragment to the nearest photograph. [350] The paper grew warm, then hot. [357] The maze within began to disintegrate, its particles spiraling outward in golden streams that hung suspended in the air. [377] But they weren't disappearing—they were unfolding, revealing dimensions the flat photograph had compressed. [392]

Through hyperbolic geometry, time could curve back into itself, creating loops and whorls. [406] Lyra understood now why she'd been designing mazes all her life. [418] Each one had been a three-dimensional model of temporal architecture, paths that doubled back not through space but through duration itself. [441] Her retrocognitive condition wasn't a curse—it was her consciousness learning to navigate these loops, to experience the hyperbolic nature of lived moments. [465]

She pressed her palm against the halo fragment fully. [475] Light exploded through the bridge garden, and every photograph in her case began to disintegrate simultaneously. [492] The maze designs rose into the air as intricate geometric structures, their hedges revealing themselves as temporal pathways, their dead ends as moments she'd tried to escape, their centers as instances of perfect understanding. [526]

The living bridge itself responded, its roots twisting into new configurations. [538] All around her, the garden was reorganizing according to the principles her mazes had always expressed: hyperbolic space made botanical, time made navigable. [561]

Lyra felt her consciousness sliding backward again, but this time she didn't resist. [574] She understood the texture now—time felt like soil after rain, dense with possibility, yielding yet structured. [593] It curved around moments of significance the way the living bridge curved around the ravine, not avoiding the depths but embracing them, drawing strength from what lay beneath. [621]

The halo fragment cooled in her hand, its light dimming to a steady glow. [636] The photographs were gone, but she didn't need them anymore. [647] The maze she'd spent her life designing was finally complete, written not in hedges but in the living geometry of her own recursive existence. [673]

She placed the fragment back in the bridge's railing, where it belonged. [687] Tomorrow, or yesterday, or in whatever direction time truly flowed, she would walk these paths again, both designer and designed, forever discovering what she'd already known. [714]
