The vagrant penny poet had seventeen names that month, and none of them felt true. [14] She sat cross-legged in the rusted library under stars, its corrugated metal roof peeled back like a sardine can, revealing the desert sky above. [35] The prison library had been abandoned three years ago when the state deemed the facility too costly to maintain, but Mara—her name this week—still came here every full moon to sort books with Kai. [67]

Kai had been released last spring, but the habit of Tuesday nights among the stacks had followed him outside the walls. [88] "You're different again," he said, not looking up from the poetry section he was rebuilding after last month's dust storm had scattered everything. [110] "Your hands move differently." [114]

She smiled, though smiling felt borrowed from whoever she'd been in August. [126] The molting had started years ago, personalities shedding like snake skin on a monthly cycle she'd stopped trying to control. [146] September's self was quieter, more angular in thought. [154] "I found something," she said, retrieving the coffee tin from her pack. [167]

The tin was rusted like everything else in this place, but when she twisted the bottom, a false compartment opened. [188] Inside: seed packets, dozens of them, wrapped in wax paper to survive the desert heat. [204] Kai's eyes widened. [207] "Where—" [208]

"The old warden's office. [212] Someone hid them before the evacuation." [218] She spread them across the warped library table: nightblooming jasmine, evening primrose, moonflowers, desert marigolds. [232] All plants that thrived in darkness and neglect. [240]

This was why she kept returning, why she'd first volunteered at the prison library five years ago when the voices in her head grew too numerous to contain. [267] To forge beauty from anarchy—not despite the chaos of her shifting selves, but because of it. [284] Each month brought new eyes to see possibility in ruins. [295]

Kai understood. [297] In prison, he'd rebuilt himself page by page, sorting books while sorting his thoughts. [311] She'd been June then, manic and caffeinated, reciting penny poems for cigarettes in the visitors' yard. [327] He'd laughed at her rhymes, terrible doggerel about sparrows and freedom. [338] But he'd also listened when August came and brought silence, when she could only shelve books and weep. [356]

"We could plant them," he said now, as the moon cleared the skyline, bright and merciless. [373] "Start here, in the library." [378]

The blooming resistance had begun accidentally. [384] Someone had scattered wildflower seeds on the prison's north fence last spring, and by summer, the razor wire disappeared beneath cascades of orange and yellow. [408] The authorities cut it down, but seeds had already spread. [419] Now flowers erupted in every forgotten corner—parking lots, gutters, the cracks in cell block D. [435]

"Not just here," she said, September's clarity cutting through. [445] "Everywhere they tried to kill beauty." [451]

They worked as the moon climbed higher, its light spilling through the library's broken roof like liquid silver. [469] The luminous fracture of everything—her mind, this building, the whole abandoned complex—felt suddenly purposeful. [485] She sorted books while Kai prepared the ground, digging into corners where dust had drifted deep enough to hold roots. [505]

Her October self would forget the specific joy of this moment, remember only the outline: planting something with Kai, moonlight, laughter. [525] But September knew that forgetting was part of the work. [535] Each personality carried different tools, different ways of seeing where beauty might take hold. [549]

"Read me something," Kai said, tamping soil around the first planted seed. [561]

She pulled a water-damaged volume from the nearest shelf, opened to a random page. [575] "They say a garden grows best where bones are buried," she read, making up the words as she went, a penny poem for this specific luminous night. [602] "But I say ruins bloom brightest when tended by broken hands, under stars that shine through holes we didn't choose to open, planting futures we won't recognize when they arrive." [631]

Kai laughed, that same sound from years ago in the prison library. [644] "That's terrible poetry." [647]

"I know," she said, grinning with September's sharp edges. [656] "That's why it's only worth a penny." [663]

But they kept planting anyway, rebuilding the rusted library into something that would bloom when the rains finally came, when the moon made its next circuit, when she'd molted into someone new who would return here and remember, hazily, that beauty was possible even now. [703]

Especially now. [705]
