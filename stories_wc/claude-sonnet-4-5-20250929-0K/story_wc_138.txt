The prismatic escondite shimmered beneath churning auroras as Cassius pressed his palm against the crystalline wall, feeling the magnetic fields writhe like serpents through the stone. [28] He had lived three thousand years, and boredom had become his most faithful companion—until the fragment arrived. [47]

The cursed amulet piece sat on his obsidian desk, no larger than a thumbnail, pulsing with a rhythm that shouldn't exist in this dimension. [71] Outside, the solar storm intensified, warping the aurora into impossible geometries that hurt to perceive. [87] Cassius was dimensionally aware—a curse in itself—and he could see the fragment wasn't merely cursed. [104] It was a key, bleeding between realities. [111]

"You're going to do something foolish," whispered Naia from the doorway, her voice carrying that hushed thunder quality she'd perfected over centuries of watching him court disaster. [138] She was mortal, or had been once, before he'd shared too much of his blood to save her. [158] Now she existed in the grey space between life and forever, resenting him for it. [175]

"The spatial coordinates keep shifting," Cassius said, gesturing at the equations hovering in light above the fragment. [193] "There's a mutiny occurring within the fabric itself—different dimensional planes refusing to align. [208] The fragment is causing it, or perhaps responding to it." [219]

"And you want to follow where it leads." [227] Naia stepped closer, her shadow fragmenting through the prismatic walls into a dozen ghost-images. [243] "You always do. [247] Three millennia of chasing mysteries because you're too proud to admit immortality is just waiting, forever." [265]

He turned to face her, seeing the accusation beneath her words. [277] "You're leaving." [280]

"Yes." [281] The word hung between them like a blade. [290] "I've found a way to die properly, finally. [299] A ritual that works even on half-immortals." [307]

The solar storm screamed against the escondite's shields, magnetic fields cascading through walls that bent light into impossible spectrums. [326] Cassius felt something unfamiliar coiling in his chest—urgency, perhaps, or the ghost of fear he'd thought long extinct. [347]

"The fragment," he said slowly, understanding blooming like poison. [357] "You brought it here. [362] You're using the spatial mutiny it creates." [370]

Naia smiled, sad and ancient despite her young face. [380] "The dimensions are revolting against their fixed positions. [389] When they tear free during the storm's peak, there will be a moment—a gap—where something like me can slip through. [411] Not to another dimension, but to what lies between them. [423] To the after." [427]

"You don't know what's there." [433] His voice came out rougher than intended. [441] "Three thousand years I've watched souls vanish beyond that veil. [452] Not once has anything returned to tell what waits." [462]

"Exactly." [463] She lifted the fragment, its curse marks crawling up her arm like living tattoos. [478] "You're bored because you can't discover anything truly new anymore. [489] I'm suffocating because I never chose this half-life you gave me." [502] She moved to the window where magnetic fields danced visible and terrible. [515] "At least let me satisfy both our curiosities. [524] Let me discover what happens after goodbye." [532]

The storm reached its crescendo, and reality began folding like paper. [544] Cassius could see the dimensions mutinying, refusing their ordained positions, creating gaps that shouldn't exist. [560] Naia pressed the fragment to her chest, and it sank inward, disappearing into her sternum. [577]

"Tell me what you find," Cassius whispered, though he knew she couldn't, knew this was the one mystery that would remain forever sealed. [601]

Naia looked back at him, tears tracking down her cheeks, each drop refracting into tiny prisms. [618] "Maybe that's the point. [623] Maybe some goodbyes are meant to be final." [632]

The dimensions tore, and she stepped into the gap, her form unraveling into threads of light that wove themselves into the magnetic currents of the storm. [658] For one eternal moment, Cassius thought he saw what lay beyond—not darkness, not light, but something else entirely. [679]

Then the storm passed, the dimensions settled into sullen compliance, and the prismatic escondite stood empty except for one bored immortal who finally understood what he'd lost. [706]

In the silence that followed, he began plotting how to tear the dimensions apart again. [722]

After all, he had nothing but time. [730]
