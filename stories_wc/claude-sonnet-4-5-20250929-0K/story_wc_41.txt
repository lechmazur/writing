The junkyard prophet walked through the fog sculpture garden at dawn, his fingers tracing the outlines of shapes that dissolved before he could name them. [28] He carried a piece of plain chalk in his coat pocket, its dusty presence a comfort against the confusion that came with his peculiar curse. [56] He was precognitively forgetful—he forgot things before they happened, lost memories of futures he would never see. [74]

The garden had been built decades ago by an artist who worked in mist and vapor, creating temporary monuments that lived only as long as the marine layer held. [103] Now the sculptures were gone, but the fog remained, thick and salt-heavy, curling around the metal frames and stone plinths like magnetic tape unspooling from forgotten cassettes. [131] Somewhere in storage units across the city, old videotapes sat in boxes, their images slowly degrading, their magnetic particles forgetting what they once recorded. [155] The prophet felt kinship with those tapes, all of them clinging to echoes of something that was already dissolving. [176]

He had come to the garden because he needed to locate something he'd lost three days from now—a sound, specifically. [197] The sound of growing older, which he had heard once in a dream that might have been a premonition, or might have been just a dream. [226] It was the creak of joints becoming architecture, the whisper of cells replacing themselves with slightly inferior copies, the tide of blood moving slower through narrowing channels. [255] He wanted to capture it, bottle it somehow, before he forgot it forward into oblivion. [271]

The beach bordered the garden's eastern edge, and he had spent yesterday gathering driftwood, arranging the bleached pieces as directional markers. [293] Each piece pointed toward a different vanishing point in the fog, creating a compass rose of possible futures. [312] North: the sound of his daughter's voice, which he would forget before she spoke her wedding vows. [330] East: the taste of the last meal he would cook in his current apartment. [346] South: the face of a woman he would almost love. [357] West: the garden itself, empty, twenty years gone. [366]

He knelt beside the central marker and withdrew the chalk from his pocket. [379] On the dark stone beneath him, he began to write everything he could remember about tomorrow's losses. [397] The words appeared backwards, white on black, a negative image of prophecy. [410] His handwriting grew smaller as he worked, cramming more and more text into shrinking spaces, because he could feel the memories of the future already starting to slip. [437]

The fog pressed closer, intimate and cold. [444] It carried sounds from the highway, from the ocean, from the gulls wheeling overhead, and mixed them into a susurrus that might have been music if he could just decode it correctly. [476] This was the tidal longing that had driven him here—the pull of something vast and rhythmic, something that took things away and brought them back altered, something that understood both erosion and accumulation. [513]

He wrote faster. [516] The chalk stuttered against the stone. [522] He documented the sensation of forgetting his mother's funeral before it happened, how he would stand at the grave and feel only a puzzled absence where grief should have nested. [552] He wrote about the coffee shop that would close, the tree that would fall, the letter he would fail to send because he'd forgotten it was important three weeks before it arrived. [586]

When the chalk crumbled to nothing in his fingers, he stood and looked at his compass of driftwood, his map of chalk, his catalog of beautiful losses. [613] The fog was lifting now, and in the pale morning light, he could see what he had built: a monument to all the futures he would never fully inhabit, a recording of the sound that played constantly beneath everything else. [653]

The sound of growing older wasn't a single note. [662] It was this—the accumulated silence of all the videotapes left unwatched, all the prophecies forgotten before their time, all the echoes that faded while you were still clinging to them. [694] He had captured it after all. [700]

The prophet walked back toward the junkyard, leaving his markers behind. [712] Tomorrow, he would forget he'd ever made them. [720] The day after, he would return, confused, and find them mysterious. [731] The day after that, the tide would take them. [740] But for now, for this crystalline moment, he held the sound inside him like a seashell holds the ocean—imperfectly, approximately, but with absolute devotion. [766]
