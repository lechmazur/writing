The prophet had been dead three days when Senna climbed to the kinetic parapet beneath the dunes. [17]

She wore the half-mask that marked her as a line walker, silver across her left eye, skin bare on the right—the old symbol of those who traveled between what was known and what could only be sensed. [54] The parapet hummed under her feet, its ancient mechanisms still responding to footfalls, still shifting its metal lattices to accommodate weight and intention. [77] Below, the murmuring pavilion spread like a moth's wing, its fabric walls breathing with the voices of those who had come to mourn. [100]

Senna wasn't there to mourn. [105]

The prophet had arrived six months ago, speaking in a voice like wind through reeds, and the settlement had transformed. [125] Where there had been rigid pathways, she conjured clearings—spaces that appeared between thoughts, places where people could gather without the weight of predetermined purpose. [149] The pavilion itself was one such clearing, manifested from collective need, held in place by shared attention. [167]

Now the prophet was gone, and the clearings were beginning to fade. [179]

Senna descended the parapet's spiral stairs, feeling the metal adjust beneath each step. [192] The murmuring grew louder as she approached—not grief, exactly, but a soft confusion, people wondering aloud how to hold onto what they'd been given. [216] She slipped through the pavilion's entrance, and the whisperfield calm that had characterized the prophet's presence still lingered here, though threadbare, wearing thin. [240]

"You're the line walker." [244] An old man approached, strangely honest in his directness. [254] Most people avoided looking at her mask. [261] "Can you preserve what she made?" [267]

"I'm here to try," Senna said. [273]

She had studied the method all her life—not to create clearings herself, but to recognize them through peripheral awareness, to sense the edges of spaces that existed only when observed from the corner of consciousness. [308] If you looked directly at a conjured clearing, it would collapse under the weight of scrutiny. [325] You had to feel it, trust the sideways glance, the half-knowing. [337]

The pavilion held perhaps fifty people, all murmuring their memories of the prophet. [350] Senna moved among them, not listening to their words but to the spaces between. [365] There—in the pause between one woman's sentence and another's—she felt it. [378] A pocket of potential. [382] She marked it in her mind, continued walking. [390]

More pockets revealed themselves. [394] The clearings weren't fully gone; they'd been woven into the community's way of gathering, into the rhythm of their conversations. [414] But without intention, without someone to consecrate them as real, they would dissolve like morning mist. [431]

Senna reached the pavilion's center, where a stone had been placed—rough granite, unremarkable except for the attention it drew. [451] The prophet's marker. [454] She knelt beside it, removed a small vial from her belt. [466] Inside: sand from the parapet above, iron filings from its kinetic mechanisms, threads from the pavilion's first raising. [485] Physical anchors. [487]

She poured the mixture in a circle around the stone, then placed both palms on the granite. [505]

"I consecrate these spaces," she whispered, "not as holy, but as necessary. [518] As gathering-places. [520] As clearings in the forest of our certainties." [529]

The murmuring stopped. [532]

Senna kept her eyes on the stone but expanded her peripheral awareness, feeling for the pockets she'd identified. [551] With careful attention—not too much, never too much—she acknowledged each one. [564] Recognized them. [566] Gave them permission to persist. [571]

The echo of the prophet's wisdom wasn't in her words, Senna realized. [584] It was in the architecture of pause she'd built, the spaces where people could exist without prescription. [602] These could be preserved, not through rigid ritual, but through the community's willingness to keep noticing them, to trust what they couldn't quite see. [628]

Senna stood, adjusted her half-mask. [634]

The murmuring resumed, softer now, reverent. [641]

Outside, the kinetic parapet continued its eternal adjustments beneath the dunes, and the clearings held. [657]

They would need maintenance—a line walker's regular visits, the community's gentle attention—but they would hold. [674]

The prophet had arrived, and the prophet had departed, but her gift remained: spaces conjured from nothing, preserved through the simple act of believing in what existed at the edge of sight. [706]

Senna left the pavilion as whisperfield calm settled over it like snow. [719]
