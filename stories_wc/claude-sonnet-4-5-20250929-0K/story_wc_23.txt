The starlit signal station had been dead for three weeks, ever since the hydraulics failed and the great antenna locked into place, pointing uselessly toward a constellation that no longer mattered. [32] Mara sat cross-legged on the observation deck, her jacket a patchwork of navigation charts from a dozen failed expeditions—fabric maps of places people used to go before the reverse migration began. [64] She traced the stitched coastlines with calloused fingers, remembering when humanity moved outward, not inward, not back toward some ancient center no one could name but everyone felt pulling at their bones. [95]

The phone rang at midnight, as it had every night since she'd arrived. [108]

"The bronze piece," the voice said without preamble. [116] "The patina tells you which direction. [122] Green toward the valleys, black toward the mountains." [130]

Mara lifted the censer foot from her workbench—all that remained of her grandmother's altar, salvaged from the coastal temple before the first wave of returnees swept through, dismantling everything in their desperate pilgrimage inward. [161] The bronze was ancient, one decorative foot from a ceremonial vessel, its surface a map of corrosion that shifted between emerald and obsidian depending on the light. [186]

"It changes," Mara said into the receiver. [193] "Different every night." [196]

"Like everything now." [199] The caller's voice carried the texture of smoke. [207] "The pull fluctuates with moon phases. [213] Stronger at the dark, weaker at the full. [221] You're building a compass, navigator. [226] To find what we've lost by mapping what we're losing." [236]

She'd been building for weeks, though she hadn't known what until this moment. [249] Scattered across the dead station's floor lay salvaged gyroscopes, magnetic cores from abandoned vehicles, fragments of old GPS satellites she'd hauled up from the valley below. [273] The reverse migration had left a trail of discarded technology—no one needed coordinates to follow the pull, that collective magnetism drawing millions back toward the world's forgotten heart. [300]

But Mara needed to understand why. [306]

Her brother had gone six months ago, walking away from their repair shop in the middle of a sentence, wrench still in hand. [327] Her mother, three months after that, leaving dinner on the stove. [338] The geography of loss was measured in empty chairs, cooling meals, projects abandoned mid-motion. [352]

"Where does it lead?" [356] Mara asked the midnight voice. [361]

"To the question you should be asking," the caller said. [371] "Not where, but whether you can build something that shows people the way back out again. [388] After they remember why they left in the first place." [398]

The patina bronze caught starlight through the station's broken dome, and Mara saw it—not direction, but duration. [415] The oxidation patterns weren't a map but a calendar, chemical time encoded in decay. [430] She arranged the gyroscopes in a circle, placed the bronze foot at the center, began wiring the magnetic cores into a web that might, just might, triangulate not position but temporal density—the weight of gathered time. [465]

The work took hours, her hands moving with the muscle memory of all her patchwork navigation, stitching together broken systems into something that could point toward meaning. [489] Outside, the moon thinned toward darkness, and she felt it in her sternum, that tug like fish-line wrapped around her heart, the same pull that had taken everyone she loved. [516]

At dawn, the device hummed. [521] The bronze foot rotated slowly on its axis, the patina shifting from green to black to green again, and the gyroscopes spun out a reading she could finally interpret. [548]

The reverse migration wasn't moving toward a place. [556] It was moving toward a time—a collected density of memory, every person adding their weight to a gravitational well of shared history, trying to become so heavy with past that they'd bend time itself into return. [593]

Mara picked up the phone before it could ring. [602]

"I understand now," she said to the silence that would soon become a voice. [616] "They're not looking for a place they lost. [624] They're trying to build it backward, memory by memory, until loss becomes impossible." [638]

"And you?" [640] the midnight voice asked. [644]

She looked at her compass, at the station's dead antenna, at the charts stitched into her jacket. [661]

"I navigate what remains," Mara said. [667] "For when they need a way to find forward again." [678]

The raw solace of that purpose settled into her bones, a different kind of weight than the pull. [695]

She began to build in earnest. [701]
