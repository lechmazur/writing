The observatory deck glowed amber through its crystalline dome, filtering light from the collapsing cosmos beyond. [15] Mira stood at the central console, her fingers hovering over a brass bowl containing coins from seventeen extinct civilizations. [33] She was quietly enthusiastic about her work, though few understood why anyone would pursue prophecy when the universe itself was shrinking toward its final singularity. [56]

"You're still doing this?" [60] Kael entered through the pressure seal, his voice carrying the stellar doubt that infected everyone nowadays. [76] "Reading fortunes while reality folds in on itself?" [85]

Mira selected three coins without looking—Persian, Atlantean, something pre-human with symbols that predated language. [100] She had become a cast lots decision maker not from mysticism but from mathematics. [115] When the universe began contracting five years ago, causality started flowing backwards in pockets, creating temporal eddies where effects preceded causes. [136] Traditional prediction became useless. [140] Only randomness, she discovered, could navigate backwards prophecy. [148]

"The static bursts are stronger today," she said, adjusting her headset. [159] The device picked up quantum fluctuations, translating them into sound—understanding static bursts was her method for detecting causality reversals. [178] "Something significant will happen. [182] Or already happened. [185] Or is happening in a direction we can't perceive." [195]

She tossed the coins. [199] They spun through the amber light, and as they landed, her equipment shrieked with interference. [215] Mira closed her eyes, letting the static wash over her consciousness. [227] This was how she worked now—distilling chaos into meaning, filtering the universe's death rattle for patterns. [243]

Images crystallized backward through her mind. [249] She saw herself yesterday, celebrating a discovery she hadn't made yet. [261] She saw Kael tomorrow, weeping at her empty station. [271] She saw last week, when the answer to everything would arrive. [283]

"The alignment," she whispered. [287] "That's what the coins are showing me. [295] Not fortune—instruction." [297]

"Instruction for what?" [300] Kael moved closer, his doubt wavering. [307]

"To wavelength align with purpose." [312] Mira pulled up star charts, overlaying them with frequency analyses. [323] "The universe isn't dying randomly. [328] It's condensing toward a specific resonance, a fundamental frequency. [338] If consciousness can match that wavelength..." [345]

The static burst again, violent and clarifying. [352] Now she understood the backwards prophecy completely. [360] The coins hadn't predicted the future—they'd received instructions from it. [371] In three days, the contraction would reach critical density. [381] Minds that matched the universe's final frequency would survive the transition, would become something new when expansion began again. [401]

"You're saying we can live through the Big Crunch?" [411] Kael's voice cracked between disbelief and desperate hope. [420]

"Not live. [422] Transform." [423] Mira studied the foreign coins again, understanding now why she'd collected them obsessively. [437] Each civilization had faced its ending. [443] Each had left currency behind—medium of exchange, symbols of value, tokens of meaning. [457] She arranged them in a pattern matching the frequency signature. [468]

The amber light deepened as another stellar collapse registered on the instruments. [481] Thousands of galaxies compressed into singularities every hour now. [491]

"Teach me," Kael said simply. [496]

Mira's quiet enthusiasm finally had purpose. [503] She showed him how to listen to the static bursts, how to hear causality running backwards, how to let random chance reveal deterministic truth. [527] The cast lots method wasn't about prediction—it was about reception, about catching messages thrown backward through time by their future selves who'd already survived. [552]

As they worked through the amber-lit hours, more observatory staff returned, drawn by the same backwards whisper. [570] Mira distilled her method into teachable steps, spreading the knowledge like a vaccine against oblivion. [586]

When the final contraction came, they stood together on the observatory deck, minds tuned to the universe's ultimate frequency. [606] The amber light brightened to white, and they felt themselves not ending but wavelength aligning with purpose, transforming into the seed pattern for whatever universe would bloom next. [634]

The prophecy had been right all along. [642] They just had to receive it backwards. [650]
