The cavern orchard grew silent beneath the moon's filtered light, which seeped through cracks in the limestone ceiling like silver milk. [22] Elara moved between the ancient apple trees, their roots drinking from pools fed by dripping stalactites, their branches heavy with fruit that glowed faintly in the darkness. [48] She was a secretive conjurer, known in the surface world only as a mathematician who had disappeared three years ago, leaving behind unfinished theorems and a grief no equation could solve. [78]

Her brother had vanished—not died, not stayed, simply ceased to exist in any provable way. [95] This ambiguous loss had driven her underground, literally and figuratively, searching for something she couldn't name. [111] Here in the cavern, she had planted an orchard nourished by mineral-rich water, each tree a variable in her gently inventive attempt to understand the mathematics of emotion. [137]

Tonight, she carried a small wooden box containing a taxidermist's glass eye pair, amber-brown and unsettlingly lifelike. [154] She had found them in her brother's studio—he had been learning the craft before he disappeared, studying how to preserve what was lost. [177] The eyes seemed to watch her even now, and she wondered if they had belonged to an owl or a wolf, something that saw in the dark. [205]

Elara knelt beside a mosaic stepping stone she had constructed at the orchard's center, each tile salvaged from the ruins of her brother's apartment. [229] The chipped patterns formed a spiral, but recently she had noticed something remarkable: when moonlight struck the damaged surfaces at certain angles, shadows formed numbers. [256] Prime numbers, specifically. [259] The sequence didn't repeat, didn't follow any pattern she recognized, and yet she felt certain it meant something—a code embedded via the chipped patterns on a mosaic stepping stone, left perhaps by accident, perhaps by design. [293]

She placed the glass eyes at the spiral's center, positioning them to face opposite directions. [308] In her practice, she had learned that conjuring wasn't about creating something from nothing; it was about revealing what already existed in the spaces between observable things. [335] Her mathematics of emotion required new axioms: that love could be quantified not by its presence but by the shape of its absence, that loss created a topology all its own. [368]

The stalactites dripped in rhythm, a metronome for her whispered calculations. [379] She spoke theorems into the darkness, equations that dovetailed quantum uncertainty with the subjective experience of grief, attempting to prove that her brother existed somewhere in the unmeasurable gaps. [408] The glass eyes began to gleam, not reflecting light but generating it, and the apple blossoms—impossible in this season—started opening around her. [432]

Through the eyes, she saw double: the cavern as it was, and the cavern as it might be. [450] In the overlapping vision, she glimpsed a figure moving between trees that weren't quite there, tending to branches in a parallel orchard. [472] Her brother? [474] A ghost? [476] A probability that hadn't yet collapsed into certainty? [484]

She didn't call out. [488] Instead, she continued her work, adding new terms to her equations, understanding now that the answer wasn't in finding him but in accepting that some systems remained unsolvable while still being true. [519] The glass eyes showed her that ambiguous loss created its own dimension, one where the missing could tend their own gardens, where silence could be companionship. [544]

As dawn approached, the moonlight faded, and the double vision dimmed. [556] Elara collected the glass eyes, noting their warmth. [564] The orchard returned to its singular state, but she felt changed, the buried optimism in her chest finally breaking surface like a seed through stone. [588] She had not solved the mathematics of emotion, but she had mapped its territory—that was enough. [605] In the cavern's perpetual twilight, she would continue planting, calculating, conjuring, knowing that some questions were answered not by their solutions but by the elegance of their asking. [634] The stalactites dripped, the roots drank, and the orchard waited for her next theorem, patient as stone, alive as grief, growing toward its own mysterious proof. [663]
