The lunar observatory hung suspended above the cloud line, its titanium struts anchored to the mountain's peak by bolts driven deep into bedrock that had not shifted in millennia. [31] Until yesterday. [33]

Kenji felt the tremor through his workbench as he bent over the disassembled chronometer, its mechanism spread before him like the organs of a clockwork heart. [58] The clock hand—salvaged from the observatory's grand orrery—wouldn't stop spinning, a blur of brass catching the thin alpine light that streamed through the dome's aperture. [84] He'd been trying to still it for three days, but it rotated with relentless momentum, as if pursuing its own escape velocity from the constraints of time itself. [111]

Another tremor rippled through the floor. [117] Director Chen appeared at his shoulder, her face luminous with equal parts wonder and worry. [132] "The seismographs are going mad," she said. [139] "But Kenji, look at the moon." [145]

Through the observatory's primary telescope, Earth's companion glowed with an intensity that seemed to pulse in rhythm with the foundation's shuddering. [166] Something was shifting in the celestial mechanics they'd observed changelessly constant for decades. [179]

"It's the orbital decay," Kenji murmured, understanding flooding through him like cold water. [192] "Accelerating." [193]

He'd come to this place, this sanctuary above the clouds, precisely because he'd hoped to capture moments before they fled. [214] To harness the ephemeral—that had always been his calling, whether repairing cameras that froze instants in silver halide or calibrating instruments that measured the moon's patient dance. [240] But now that dance was changing, the foundations literally shaking beneath certainties they'd built their lives upon. [257]

The spinning clock hand blurred faster. [263]

"We need to restructure the entire tracking array," Chen said, her voice tight with urgency. [278] "Recalibrate every instrument. [281] Can you do it?" [285]

Kenji closed his eyes, letting the tremors speak through his feet, through his bones. [300] His grandmother had taught him to repair cameras by the sound of a leaf falling—to trust his senses beyond sight, to hear the whisper of a shutter blade settling into its groove. [333] She'd understood that true precision came not from force but from listening to what wanted to move, to change, to escape. [355]

He opened his eyes and began to work. [363]

Not fighting the spinning hand, but following it. [371] He adjusted the orrery's gears, not to slow the mechanism but to redirect its energy through new pathways. [390] Each tremor from below became data; each pulse of lunar luminescence through the dome, information. [405] The other instruments—cameras, spectrographs, the ancient telescope itself—he rewired them all to accept motion rather than resist it. [425]

Chen watched, understanding dawning. [429] "You're not trying to restore the old parameters." [438]

"The old parameters are gone," Kenji said, his fingers dancing across calibration dials with the delicate certainty of a sage who'd spent forty years learning the grammar of precision instruments. [467] "The moon is leaving us. [472] Not tomorrow, not next year—but the acceleration has begun. [482] We can't photograph what was. [488] We can only capture what's becoming." [494]

As he spoke, the clock hand's blur began to resolve into discrete motion, no longer chaotic but purposeful, tracing ellipses that matched the moon's new trajectory. [517] The restructured array hummed to life, cameras clicking in rhythmic sequence, each one now calibrated to anticipate change rather than memorialize stasis. [538]

The foundation trembled again, but this time Kenji felt no fear, only a luminous ache in his chest—the bittersweet recognition that everything beautiful eventually reaches for its own escape velocity. [567] The moon would slip away across centuries, following the same physics that made the clock hand spin. [585] All he could do, all anyone could do, was bear witness to the leaving. [600]

Through the telescope, the moon blazed against the void, already infinitesimally farther than it had been that morning. [618]

"It's recording," Chen whispered, watching the data stream across her monitors—the first measurements of humanity's companion in the act of departure. [639]

Kenji carefully placed the still-spinning clock hand back into the orrery's heart, where it belonged. [654] Let it spin. [657] Let everything reach for the velocity it needed. [666] His instruments would follow, faithful and ready, capturing light across the growing distance until even that ephemeral thread finally broke. [686]

The clouds below glowed silver. [691] Above them, the observatory stood witness, restructured and listening, as the foundations of everything continued their gentle, inexorable shake. [710]
