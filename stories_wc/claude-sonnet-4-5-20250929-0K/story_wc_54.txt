The carnival had left three days ago, taking with it the last pretense that anyone still cared about the Meridian Spaceport. [22] Lena stood in the passenger terminal's central atrium, her engineering tablet casting blue light across cracked marble floors where families once gathered to watch departures through the dome overhead. [49] Now only starlight filtered through the pitted glass, silent and indifferent. [60]

She was supposed to be surveying structural integrity for the demolition company, cataloging failure points in concrete and steel. [78] Instead, she found herself tracing water stains on the walls, following the dark fingers that spread from ceiling to floor in patterns that seemed almost deliberate. [105]

"Water finds its way," her supervisor always said. [113] "Engineers just convince it to go where we need it." [123]

The thought made her pause at an old information kiosk. [133] Behind its shattered screen, she noticed something metallic wedged between wall panels—a brass arc with calibrated markings, part of an antique sextant. [156] She carefully extracted it, wondering what explorer had passed through here, what stars they'd been chasing. [172]

The terminal was a maze of intentions, she realized. [181] Every corridor had been designed to channel passengers efficiently—toward gates, restaurants, observation decks. [194] The architects had choreographed human flow with invisible precision, and even in abandonment, those pathways remained, ghost rivers of purpose. [213]

Lena climbed to the upper concourse, where the carnival had set up its final stand. [228] Cotton candy stains still marked the floor in pink spirals. [238] She understood why they'd chosen this place—the high ceilings, the sense of transition, the melancholy romance of departure. [257] The carnival had redirected the terminal's dormant energy one last time, resurrect­ing it briefly as something new. [274]

That's when she saw it: the water damage wasn't random. [284] The stains mapped the terminal's original drainage system, but decades of neglect had created new pathways. [299] Rainwater entering through dome fractures now flowed along electrical conduits, behind wall panels, through ventilation shafts—a shadow infrastructure that had evolved without human intention. [323]

She pulled up the original blueprints on her tablet, overlaying them with thermal scans she'd taken. [338] Where water now traveled, temperature differentials created micro-climates. [346] In one abandoned bookstore, moisture condensation had fostered a garden of shelf-mushrooms. [358] In another corridor, mineral deposits had formed crystalline patterns across windows, refracting light into unexpected spectrums. [374]

Lena's mind began working through the equations, functionally creative in the way only desperate optimism allowed. [389] If she could map these new flows, could redirect them intentionally through the existing structure... [404]

She spent the night drafting. [409] The demolition company wanted a teardown, but what if the terminal could be resurrected through its own decay? [427] Use the water infiltration to create hydroponic gardens in the old gate areas. [441] Channel condensation to drive turbines in the baggage handling tunnels—small-scale power generation. [454] Let the crystalline mineral deposits continue forming on strategic windows, creating an ever-changing art installation. [470]

The sextant piece sat beside her laptop, its arc catching starlight through the dome. [484] Explorers had once used such instruments to find their way by measuring angles between celestial bodies and horizons. [502] She was doing something similar—finding bearings not by fighting the terminal's degradation but by measuring the angles between what it had been and what it was becoming. [530]

By dawn, she had a proposal: not demolition but metamorphosis. [541] A community space powered by redirected flows, where abandoned infrastructure became living architecture. [554] The terminal's maze of intentions, designed to move people toward departure, could be rewired to draw them toward arrival—to gardens, to gathering spaces, to possibility. [578]

Her supervisor would probably reject it. [584] The demolition contract was already signed. [590] But Lena attached her calculations to an email and sent them anyway, these new equations for hope pieced together from brass instruments and water stains. [613]

Outside, stars faded as morning approached. [619] The terminal stood stoic around her, waiting to learn whether it would fall or rise. [634] Lena pocketed the sextant piece and walked through the maze one more time, already seeing green where there was only gray, already hearing voices where there was only echo. [663]

The carnival had left town. [668] But perhaps, she thought, something else was just beginning to arrive. [679]
