The umbral grotto floated among the clouds like a secret held between sky and heaven, its shadowed mouth breathing mist into the endless white. [26] Keiko had discovered it three years ago, when grief still carved hollows in her chest, back when she climbed trees to think better and found this impossible place at the summit of the oldest cedar. [64] Now she returned monthly, carrying water and rice for the woman who lived within. [79]

The woman had no name Keiko knew. [86] She sat always in the same position, cross-legged on smooth stone, her hair falling like a silver waterfall to pool around her knees. [108] An antique hairpin—lacquered red with a phoenix rising—held back one temple's worth of that impossible length. [126] Keiko had asked about it once, and the woman had smiled with such ancient kindness that Keiko felt her question answered without words. [148]

"You've come again," the woman said, her voice carrying that vineyard hush Keiko associated with sacred things, with the moment before prayer becomes breath. [171] "Still seeking?" [174]

Keiko knelt and unpacked her basket. [180] Rice cakes wrapped in bamboo leaves. [186] Fresh water in clay bottles sealed with wax. [194] "I thought I'd found it," she admitted. [202] "Last month, I thought I understood contentment." [210]

The woman's laugh was soft as clouds passing. [218] "And now?" [221]

"Now I think contentment has no source, no single spring to cup my hands beneath." [237] Keiko arranged the offerings carefully, as a committed caretaker should. [248] She had been tending to her mother when she first climbed that cedar, desperate to escape the bedroom's medicinal smell, the labored breathing, the waiting. [272] Her mother had done the unforgivable—abandoned Keiko and her sister for another family when they were small. [289] But when disease came calling, there was only Keiko to answer. [301]

"Tell me what you've learned," the woman said, and Keiko heard the command beneath the gentle request—kindly decisive, like a blade wrapped in silk. [325]

Keiko settled beside her. [329] Through the grotto's opening, clouds moved in their eternal dance, forming and reforming, never the same shape twice. [347] "I've been watching the fishermen in the village," she said. [358] "They scallop the bay's edges each morning, gathering what the tide brings in." [372] She paused, finding her words. [377] "They don't question why the sea gives. [385] They don't seek its source." [391]

The woman reached up, and for the first time in three years, removed the antique hairpin. [408] Her hair cascaded forward, and Keiko gasped—because beneath those silver strands, she saw her mother's face. [425] Not as she'd been at the end, diminished and pleading, but as Keiko barely remembered from earliest childhood, luminous with youth. [445]

"The cycle of rebirth," the woman said, "isn't about becoming someone new." [458] She pressed the hairpin into Keiko's palm. [466] "It's about remembering who we've always been, again and again, until we can hold all our selves at once without breaking." [489]

Keiko's fingers closed around the lacquered wood. [496] She had forgiven her mother during those final months, spooning soup into cracked lips, washing wasted limbs, receiving mumbled apologies she'd stopped believing she needed. [518] After forgiving the unforgivable, she'd expected peace to arrive like a gift. [531] Instead, she'd found this restlessness, this hunger to understand why forgiveness hadn't solved everything. [545]

"Contentment," the woman continued, and Keiko knew now she was speaking to both her mother and this eternal guardian, both and neither, "isn't found. [570] It's practiced, like breathing. [575] Like climbing trees when the ground feels too solid. [585] Like bringing rice to strangers who might be everyone you've ever loved." [597]

The woman—her mother, herself, the mountain, the mist—smiled. [607] "Keep the hairpin. [610] When you need to think better, hold it and remember: the source you seek is the seeking itself." [629]

Keiko descended the cedar with steady hands, the antique phoenix pressing against her palm like a heartbeat, like a promise, like the next breath in an endless, contented cycle. [658]
