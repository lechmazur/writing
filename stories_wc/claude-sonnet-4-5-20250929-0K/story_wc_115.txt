The valve wheel's beads clicked under Marcus's fingers as he turned it, each ceramic segment worn smooth by decades of phantom workers. [23] The abandoned textile mill squatted at the edge of town like a rusted monument, and Marcus had explored every room except the basement tunnel that connected to the old rail line. [54] Now, standing in that tunnel's throat, he felt the drowsy alertness that came from three consecutive nights chasing rumors. [73]

His phone played softly against the dripping darkness—WKRZ's overnight psychic hotline, the only station that reached down here. [92] Marcus had learned to appraise the mill's mysteries through these frantic calls, believing that desperate people revealed patterns the religiously skeptical could decode. [113] Tonight, caller after caller spoke of factory work, of shifts that never ended, of truths they'd swallowed and couldn't digest. [133]

"I keep hearing the second shift," a woman's voice trembled through the static. [146] "But the factory closed in '73. [152] My father worked there. [156] He never told us what happened the night Tommy Reeves disappeared." [167]

The psychic's theatrical voice oozed sympathy, but Marcus leaned closer to his phone. [180] Tommy Reeves—he'd seen that name scratched into the brick near the valve station. [194]

The tunnel stretched ahead, railroad ties rotting into the earth. [204] Marcus's flashlight caught something metallic: another valve wheel, this one decorated with blue and white beads arranged like rosary prayers. [223] Someone had cared enough to beautify these industrial remnants. [232] He photographed it, adding to his documentation. [239]

"The truth has weight," the caller continued, her voice breaking. [249] "It sits in your stomach like a stone. [257] My father knew Tommy didn't just leave town." [265]

Marcus turned the beaded wheel slowly. [271] Water hammered somewhere in the pipes, a rhythmic pulse like machinery that had never truly stopped. [288] The factory ghost shift—he'd dismissed it as folklore until he'd spent five nights listening to the radio calls, until he'd mapped every confession against the mill's architecture. [315]

The pattern was undeniable: people called during specific hours, always between two and six AM, always mentioning the second shift, always carrying the weight of swallowed truths. [339]

"I need to say it," the woman whispered, and in the sudden hush that followed, Marcus heard it—footsteps on metal, the distant clang of lunch pails, voices discussing production quotas. [366]

The confession came like water breaching a dam. [374] "Tommy found out about the chemical dumping. [381] They were pouring it straight into the groundwater. [389] My father was there when the foreman—when they—" [398]

The line went dead. [402]

Marcus's flashlight flickered, and in that stuttering illumination, he saw them: shadows moving with purpose along the tunnel walls, carrying shapes that might have been tools or evidence or guilt itself. [432] The factory ghost shift, working eternally to process what had never been properly resolved. [446]

He turned another beaded wheel, and the shadows paused. [455] In his religiously skeptical mind, Marcus understood—these weren't supernatural remnants but psychic impressions, the weight of collective guilt pressed into stone and steel and water. [479] Every frantic caller to the radio psychic was trying to lighten a load their families had carried for fifty years. [499]

The tunnel's air grew thick with drowsy alertness, that liminal state between dream and waking where truth becomes visible. [517] Marcus found more valve wheels, each decorated with beads in different colors—prayers or markers or both. [533] Someone had been documenting the ghost shift's path, mapping where the workers walked their eternal routes. [549]

His phone crackled to life again. [555] Another caller, another confession about the mill, about Tommy Reeves, about chemicals and coverups and the weight of swallowed truth. [575]

Marcus turned the final valve wheel, and water rushed through ancient pipes. [587] The shadows along the tunnel walls seemed to lighten, to lift, as if confession—even secondhand, even through desperate calls to radio psychics—could finally release the pressure of decades. [615]

He climbed back toward the mill's entrance, his documentation complete. [626] The factory ghost shift would continue, he knew, until every family found the courage to speak directly. [642] But he'd found what he came for: the weight of a swallowed truth, measured in beaded valve wheels and midnight confessions, heavy enough to press shadows into stone for half a century. [673]

Behind him, the tunnel filled with the sound of a shift change, workers finally clocking out. [689]
