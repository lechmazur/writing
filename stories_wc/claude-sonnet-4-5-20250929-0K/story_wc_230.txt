The hanging orchard swayed in the ravine's perpetual wind, its gnarled branches clinging to rope bridges that groaned with each gust. [22] Mira descended the hemp ladder with practiced efficiency, her canvas sack already heavy with black truffles dug from the storm-churned soil below. [44] She was rational about her foraging—mapping fungal networks, tracking rainfall patterns, avoiding the superstitious rituals other foragers had adopted since the empathy virus swept through three years ago. [70]

The virus hadn't killed anyone, but it had fractured something essential in how people connected. [86] Those infected experienced involuntary truth-telling, their inner thoughts spilling out in jagged confessions that destroyed relationships and communities. [104] Mira had survived uninfected, watching her neighbors turn on each other as brutal honesty replaced social grace. [121] Now she lived alone, preferring the company of trees and fungi to the psychological minefield of human interaction. [139]

She was examining a promising root system when she noticed the glass eye half-buried in mud. [156] It was antique, hand-blown, with an iris of impossible green swirled through with gold. [171] Something about its weight in her palm felt significant, though Mira dismissed the impulse. [185] She pocketed it anyway, a habit from her old life as an antiquities dealer. [200]

At the market, old Henrik grabbed her sleeve with trembling fingers. [212] "You found it," he whispered, staring at the glass eye now displayed among her truffles. [228] "The Weeping Saint's relic. [233] We thought it lost when the smugglers' ship went down in the ravine flood." [248]

Mira knew the story—a medieval artifact supposedly blessed by a saint who could occlude painful memories, smuggled across borders for decades by collectors seeking its legendary powers. [275] "It's just glass," she said, but Henrik was already crying. [287]

"My daughter won't speak to me since the virus made me tell her what I really thought about her marriage. [307] Please. [309] The old textbooks mention cures. [315] Discredited now, yes, but what if they knew something?" [326]

Mira had seen those books—pre-scientific texts claiming that certain relics could absorb unwanted truths, creating spaces where people could interact without the virus's brutal honesty. [352] Nonsense, obviously. [355] Yet Henrik's desperation carved something loose in her chest. [365]

She'd been cultivating psychological safety in her own way, she realized—retreating from all human contact rather than risk the virus's truth-telling spreading to her. [389] But that wasn't safety. [393] That was just isolation wearing a protective mask. [401]

"I'll make a deal," Mira said. [408] "I'll let people come to the orchard. [416] Hold the relic if they want. [422] But I won't promise miracles." [427]

Word spread quickly. [430] The infected came in pairs and small groups, descending into the storm-battered ravine where the hanging orchard created a world apart. [451] Mira watched as they passed the glass eye between them, speaking carefully, trying to rebuild conversations that the virus had demolished. [471]

She noticed something curious. [475] When people believed the relic could occlude their compulsive honesty, they spoke with more care—not lies, but grace. [493] They paused before responding. [497] They considered their words. [501] The relic did nothing, Mira was certain, but their faith in it created space for intention, for choosing which truths to voice and which to hold privately. [527]

Henrik reconciled with his daughter on a rope bridge between apple trees, both of them clutching the glass eye like a talisman. [548] Mira charged nothing, asked nothing, simply maintained the orchard and let people come. [562]

She understood now that rationality wasn't about dismissing human need for ritual and symbol. [576] Sometimes the most rational approach was recognizing that people required frameworks—even false ones—to rebuild what had been fractured. [596]

The glass eye remained on a wooden post at the orchard's entrance, weathered by storms, catching light like a beacon for those seeking not truth or lies, but the difficult grace between them. [628]

In her canvas sack, truffles continued to grow in their mysterious patterns beneath the earth, proof that hidden things could flourish even in damaged soil. [652]
