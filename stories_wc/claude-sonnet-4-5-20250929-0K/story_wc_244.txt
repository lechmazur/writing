The disused railway station had become Mara's headquarters not by design but by necessity, its platforms overgrown with ivy that crept through broken windows like nature reclaiming its due. [30] She operated from the old ticket office, where moss-covered benches hosted crates of water purifiers and medical supplies awaiting distribution to disaster zones most relief organizations had forgotten. [58] Mara was elusive by profession—appearing in crisis zones, coordinating impossible logistics, then vanishing before anyone could properly thank her or demand she fill out paperwork. [84]

"The thing about loneliness," she told the fragment of moon rock she kept on her makeshift desk, "is that it's the only disaster no one sends aid for." [112] The rock had arrived three weeks ago in a package with no return address, accompanied by a note: *You helped my village after the floods. [138] Reciprocity demands I help you. [143] This fell from the sky near my home. [151] Perhaps it fell near yours too.* [157]

Mara had laughed—that desperately jocular bark she'd perfected to deflect genuine emotion—and kept the stone. [173] She didn't believe it was actually lunar material, but she appreciated the gesture. [186] In her work, reciprocity was the invisible currency; she helped communities, and they helped each other, creating networks of mutual aid that governments couldn't map or control. [213]

That's when Emil found her. [218]

He materialized in the doorway like rumor made flesh, which was appropriate because rumor was how he traveled. [236] "You're harder to locate than credible information," he said politely, though his eyes held the wild gleam of someone who'd decoded too many conspiracy theories. [261] "But I heard from a doctor in Jakarta who heard from a nurse in Naples who heard from a water engineer in Morocco that you might have it." [290]

"Have what?" [292] Mara asked, though something in her chest tightened. [300]

"The moon rock fragment." [304] Emil stepped inside, uninvited but not unwelcome, his movements carrying the practiced anarchy of someone who'd crossed too many borders without permission. [326] "There are seventeen of us. [331] We all received fragments. [335] We all work in disaster relief. [341] We're all—" He paused, and his professional mask cracked. [351] "We're all so bloody lonely we've forgotten what connection feels like." [362]

Mara lifted the stone. [366] In the station's dim light, it seemed to pulse with something deeper than reflection. [380] "Someone's conducting an experiment," she said. [386]

"Or trying to catalyze something," Emil countered. [393] "The rumor chains are too precise. [399] Each fragment came with coordinates—not addresses, but meeting points. [408] Abandoned places where infrastructure failed but nature persists." [416] He gestured at the ivy-shrouded station. [422] "Like this." [424]

Over the following days, others arrived, guided by improbable rumor chains that connected disaster zones across continents. [341] There was Yuki, who'd coordinated shelter logistics through three pandemics. [451] Marcus, who'd built water systems in war zones. [459] Seraphine, who'd delivered medicines to forgotten islands. [466] Each carried a moon rock fragment. [472] Each wore the same desperately jocular mask Mara recognized from her mirror. [483]

They gathered in the old station, and someone suggested combining the fragments. [495] When the seventeen pieces touched, they didn't merge or glow or do anything mystical. [509] But something shifted. [512]

"This is when the story changes," Mara said quietly. [521] Because suddenly she understood: the moon rocks weren't magic. [530] They were permission. [533] Permission to stop moving. [537] Permission to need others. [541] Permission to build something permanent from their shared understanding of impermanence. [551]

"Reciprocity," Emil said, comprehending. [555] "Whoever sent these knew we'd only stop for each other. [566] Knew we'd only trust a network we discovered ourselves." [575]

The disused railway station became their anchor point, where the logistics of human connection were finally mapped. [591] They still disappeared to disasters, but they always returned, bound by reciprocity, cured of loneliness not by magic but by choosing, finally, to stay found. [614]

The moon rocks remained on a shared table, fragments of something distant that had catalyzed something immediate: the polite anarchy of people who'd learned that mutual aid began with aiding each other. [644]

In the ivy-covered station where trains no longer ran, they built the infrastructure no relief organization provided—a network for the networkers, disaster relief for those who'd forgotten they were disasters too. [675]

And when asked how they'd found each other, they'd laugh—desperately, jocularly, and finally, genuinely—and say only: "We heard a rumor." [695]
