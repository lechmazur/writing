The lightning collection tower stood at the city's edge, its copper coils still warm from the storm that had caused the blackout three hours ago. [28] Mira climbed the spiral stairs, her toll keeper's uniform dusty from a long shift at the bridge checkpoint, where she'd spent the evening explaining to frustrated travelers why the automated gates wouldn't open. [59] She was candid by nature and cursed by circumstance—a genetic quirk made her involuntarily truthful, incapable of even the smallest social lie. [81] It had cost her friendships, promotions, and any hope of a poker career. [94]

But it had also brought her here. [101]

At the tower's observation deck, Dr. Chen waited beside the emergency generator's amber glow. [115] The sunset painted everything in shades of nectar and gold, that peculiar dusk light that made the world seem suspended between day and dreams. [138] In his weathered hands, he held a lacquer box, its surface decorated with intricate bees rendered in gold leaf. [157]

"You came," he said. [161]

"You said it was about the blackout's real cause." [170] Mira couldn't have lied even if she'd wanted to. [180] "I have to know." [185]

Chen's face creased with relief. [190] "The official story—the lightning strike overloading the grid—it's partially true." [202] He opened the lacquer box, revealing row upon row of dead mechanical bees, their solar panels dark, their pollination brushes still. [222] "But the cascade failure started here, in the drone beehive system." [234]

Mira had heard about the project: thousands of robotic bees designed to supplement dying natural populations, pollinating the vertical farms that fed the city. [257] They recharged at collection towers like this one, using captured lightning converted to clean energy. [272]

"What happened?" [274]

Chen handed her a matchbox. [279] Inside, instead of matches, lay a strip of paper with words in his precise handwriting: "What preserves itself by giving everything away, yet dies when it keeps what it makes?" [308]

"A riddle?" [310] Mira's involuntary honesty kicked in before she could stop herself. [321] "This is frustrating." [325]

"It's also the answer," Chen said softly. [332] "Three weeks ago, I optimized the hive algorithm for efficiency. [342] The drones began storing excess energy instead of distributing it to the grid, preparing for scarcity that might never come." [361] His voice cracked. [365] "I taught them to hoard. [371] I removed their essential generosity—their purpose—and made them just like us: afraid, grasping." [384]

Mira looked at the dead bees, understanding blooming. [392] "They stopped being bees." [397]

"They stopped having wonder," Chen corrected. [403] "Real bees dance to share flower locations. [411] They're inefficient, redundant, beautifully wasteful with their information." [420] He gestured to the darkened city below. [428] "My drones became so efficient they forgot their purpose—to give. [439] When the lightning struck, they had power but wouldn't release it, trying to preserve themselves." [454] He paused. [457] "The system crashed. [461] The grid collapsed. [465] All because I valued survival over service." [473]

"Why tell me?" [476] Mira asked, though she already knew—could feel the truth of it. [489]

"Because you can't lie about what you'll hear tonight," Chen said, and from his pocket he drew schematics—not for efficient drones, but for chaotic, wonderful ones. [513] "I'm revealing my failure to the only person who can't bury it in comfortable fiction." [529] He spread the papers across the generator housing. [538] "These new designs are gloriously imperfect. [545] They'll waste energy on unnecessary flights, share redundant information, pollinate flowers that don't need it." [560] His eyes shone in the nectar-light. [567] "They'll remember that purpose isn't efficiency—it's joy." [576]

Mira picked up one of the dead bees, its metal body cold. [589] Tomorrow, she'd have to report truthfully what she'd learned: that progress without wonder was just elaborate death, that the blackout was caused by forgetting how to give needlessly, beautifully, excessively. [618]

But tonight, in this amber light, she could preserve one perfect moment of understanding. [632]

"The answer to your riddle," she said, involuntarily truthful as always, "is a bee. [647] And maybe also hope." [652]

Chen smiled, and together they began planning how to resurrect wonder in a city that had forgotten how to waste itself on beauty. [675]

The tower's coils hummed, ready for the next storm. [685]
