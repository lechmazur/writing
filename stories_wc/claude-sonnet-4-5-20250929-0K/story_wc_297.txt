The future arrived three weeks ahead of schedule, and Mira hadn't been ready. [13] She stood at the edge of the cobalt glade as dusk painted the sky in bruised purples, clutching the maze topiary clipping she'd stolen from the old estate. [38] The leaves still held their geometric precision, a fragment of order in a world that had suddenly lurched forward into prophecy. [60]

Mira had always been what her grandmother called root-bound—a visionary whose dreams grew so dense and tangled they couldn't expand, couldn't reach beyond their own recursive patterns. [87] She'd seen the convergence coming in her meditations, felt it in the way reality seemed to shudder and skip, but she'd thought she had time. [113] Time to prepare, time to understand, time to find where her dreams intersected with everyone else's waking world. [131]

The covenant had been eclipsed the moment the future collapsed into the present. [144] That ancient agreement between seers and the timeline itself—the promise that visions would arrive with warning enough to act—had been swallowed by shadow. [169] Now Mira stood in the glade where blue grass grew in defiant, unnatural spirals, purposefully curious about what might still be salvaged. [191]

She pressed the topiary clipping against the scar on her palm, a mark she'd earned five years ago when she'd tried to prune her own prophetic abilities. [217] The pain had taught her something crucial: that connecting through wounds, linking through scars, revealed pathways that unblemished skin could never perceive. [239]

"You came," a voice said behind her. [246]

Marcus emerged from the cobalt shadows, his own hands marked with the crescent-shaped scars of someone who'd tried to grasp the future too tightly. [269] He was a visionary too, but where Mira's dreams grew inward, his scattered like dandelion seeds, never taking root. [287] They'd been seeking this intersection for years—the place where his breadth and her depth might finally meet. [305]

"The covenant broke," Mira said, her voice trembling with anxious elation. [316] The emotion felt wrong and right simultaneously, terror and joy braided together until she couldn't separate them. [333] "We have to heed what's happening now, not what we saw before." [346]

Marcus nodded, holding up his own artifact—a shard of mirror from the collapsed timeline, edges sharp enough to draw blood. [367] "Link with me," he said. [372] "Through the scars. [375] It's the only way to map where our dreams actually intersect." [387]

They'd theorized this method for months: that trauma held memory, that wounds recognized other wounds, that pain could become a navigation system through chaos. [412] Mira pressed her scarred palm against his, the topiary clipping crushed between them, and felt the jolt of connection. [431]

Images cascaded through the joining: his scattered visions of a thousand possible tomorrows suddenly anchored by her deep, root-bound certainty. [450] Her tangled dreams finding pathways through his expansive networks. [459] The intersection wasn't a place but a state of being—a recognition that their limitations had always been complementary. [478]

The cobalt glade pulsed around them, responding to their merged consciousness. [489] The grass spiraled tighter, forming new patterns, new geometries that reflected both depth and breadth. [505] Mira understood now why the future had arrived early: because they'd been waiting for permission, for the perfect moment, instead of heeding the urgent call of now. [531]

"We can still guide it," Marcus whispered, his voice carrying the same anxious elation that thrummed through her veins. [549] "The eclipsed covenant—we can write a new agreement." [558]

The topiary clipping crumbled between their palms, its ordered shape dissolving into fertile soil. [572] From that soil, Mira felt something new beginning to grow: not her root-bound visions or his scattered prophecies, but something that belonged to both and neither. [598] A shared dream, rising through their linked scars into the darkening cobalt sky, finally finding the intersection where all possible futures converged. [620] They stood together as dusk deepened into night, no longer separate visionaries but a single, purposefully curious force, ready to navigate the future that had arrived too soon and exactly on time. [651]
