The escape room proprietor arrived at her nocturnal haven beside a quiet brook just as the moon cleared the treeline. [21] Margot had purchased the weathered cottage three years ago specifically for its isolation, a place where she could design puzzles without interruption, where ideas could flow freely across the hush of a possibility just born. [57] Tonight, however, she carried something that had arrived uninvited: a small padded envelope containing a single seed and no return address. [79]

The mystery seed mail phenomenon had plagued puzzle enthusiasts for months. [90] Someone was sending cryptic botanical specimens to escape room designers across the region, each package containing only a seed and a card printed with coordinates. [115] Margot had dismissed the reports until her own package arrived that afternoon. [127]

She settled onto the cottage's worn deck, listening to the brook's gentle murmur beneath the storm-born silence that follows heavy rain. [148] The air hung thick and expectant. [154] Margot had always been notably receptive to patterns others missed—it was what made her escape rooms legendary. [171] Players praised her ability to weave seemingly unrelated clues into elegant solutions, to guide them through orthogonal approaches that suddenly converged at the final lock. [196]

She turned the seed over in her palm. [204] Large, flat, oddly textured. [209] The coordinates on the card pointed to a location upstream, perhaps a mile into the woods. [225]

Most recipients had planted their seeds, treating the mystery as a game. [237] But Margot recognized something darker in the pattern. [245] Three designers who'd received seeds had closed their businesses within weeks. [256] One had sold her entire operation. [262] Another had converted his space into a conventional arcade. [271] The third had simply disappeared. [276]

Margot photographed the seed under her desk lamp, then searched her botanical database. [289] The match appeared within seconds: Amorphophallus titanum. [296] Corpse flower. [298] The bloom was legendary—massive, rare, and infamous for its stench of rotting flesh. [312] It could take seven to ten years to flower, requiring specific conditions and constant attention. [327]

Her breath caught. [330]

This wasn't a game. [334] It was sabotage. [337]

Someone understood that escape room proprietors shared a particular obsession with mysteries, an inability to leave puzzles unsolved. [355] Plant the seed, follow the coordinates, invest time and resources into nurturing something that would eventually bloom into a putrid spectacle. [377] The cultivation would consume the very creative energy needed to design new rooms. [390] The distraction would flow through every aspect of their business, slowly drowning innovation under the weight of botanical obligation. [408]

Margot's escape room, The Liminal Door, had become a sanctuary for unconventional thinkers. [421] Engineers tested their lateral reasoning there. [427] Artists found inspiration in her narrative puzzles. [434] Teenagers discovered they could solve problems their standardized tests never measured. [445] She'd built it to safeguard space for innovation, for the kind of thinking that emerged only when minds were free to explore orthogonal approaches to conventional problems. [472]

She wouldn't let someone corrupt that. [478]

Margot walked to the brook's edge, seed in hand. [488] The coordinates likely led to others who'd been trapped by their curiosity, tending their corpse flowers in isolated clearings, watching their businesses wither. [509] She could go. [512] She could investigate. [515]

Or she could choose a different solution. [522]

She dropped the seed into the flowing water and watched it tumble away into darkness. [537] Tomorrow, she would contact every escape room designer who'd received mystery seed mail. [551] She would warn them about the corpse flower, about the calculated attack on their creative spaces. [567] She would help them understand that some mysteries weren't meant to be solved—some were meant to be recognized as traps and avoided. [589]

The brook carried the seed away into the storm-born silence. [600] Margot remained on the bank, notably receptive to the peace that settled over her nocturnal haven. [616] She had protected her space, not by following someone else's coordinates, but by refusing to let the mystery control her path. [636]

Above, clouds parted. [639] Moonlight touched the water. [643] Tomorrow, her work would continue. [648] Tonight, innovation was safe. [652]
