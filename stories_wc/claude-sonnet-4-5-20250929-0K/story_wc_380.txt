The whale had beached three days ago, and since then the gravity had gone wrong. [15]

Maris made her rounds along the docks at dusk, lighting the iron lanterns one by one, but now she had to judge each step carefully. [38] Some sections of the pier held her boots fast to the weathered planks, while others let her rise dangerously high before she caught a mooring post and pulled herself down. [68] The pockets of gravity fluctuated mysteriously, strongest near where the whale's great body had been carved away and hauled to the salt crystal growing chambers inland. [94]

She carried her grandmother's book of pressed wildflowers in her coat pocket, its weight a comfort against the inconstancy of everything else. [114]

The city had hired diviners to read the patterns, and they hunched over coffee grounds in the harbormaster's office, searching for meaning in the dark sediment. [137] Maris watched them through the window as she worked, their fingers tracing invisible connections, their faces grave in the lamplight. [157] They said the whale had carried something in its belly, some dense thing that bent the world around it even now. [178]

But Maris suspected differently. [182]

Her grandmother had walked these same docks forty years ago, lighting the same lanterns, and had vanished one winter night. [202] No body, no note, just gone—and with her, all of Maris's childhood memories of the woman's face. [221] She remembered the *facts* of her grandmother: the lantern route, the pressed flowers, the worn hands. [238] But the living moments had been excised, leaving only hollow knowledge. [249]

The diviners said deleted memories had to go somewhere. [258] Matter and memory both conserved, they insisted, just transformed beyond recognition. [269]

Maris had spent years searching, and when the whale beached, she knew. [282]

The salt crystal growing chambers stretched beneath the city like a cathedral of stone and brine. [299] Maris descended after her rounds, lantern in hand, following the maintenance tunnels to where they'd stored the whale's organs. [319] The gravity grew heavier with each step, then lighter, then sideways, and she pressed her palm against the wall to stay oriented. [341]

The chambers gleamed in silence, vast pools of saturated water where salt crystals formed their slow geometry. [358] The whale's heart sat in the center chamber, still and huge, surrounded by brine. [374]

Maris set down her lantern and removed the book of pressed wildflowers. [387] She'd studied the diviners' methods, watched how they read patterns in grounds and leaves. [402] Carefully, she scattered the brittle flowers across the water's surface—columbine, foxglove, sea lavender—and watched them drift and turn. [422]

The patterns formed quickly: spirals within spirals, recursive and purposeful. [433]

The flowers pointed toward the heart. [439]

Maris waded into the pool, gasoline-slick with dissolved minerals, the cold biting through her clothes. [455] The gravity shifted around her, pulling her toward the heart, then pushing her away, then sideways through dimensions she couldn't name. [476]

She pressed her hands against the whale's heart and understood. [487]

The creature hadn't carried some dense object—it had carried absences, gaps, the spaces where removed things went. [505] Deleted memories, excised moments, all the extracted pieces of lives. [516] They accumulated in the deep places, in the bodies of old things that swam the oldest currents. [534]

To exhume them, she would have to enter. [543]

Maris drew her grandmother's paring knife from her belt and cut into the heart's thick muscle. [560] The flesh parted easily, and inside she found not blood but crystallized moments: her grandmother's laugh, the smell of lamp oil and lavender, the weight of a hand on her child-shoulder. [590]

She gathered them carefully, these salt-crystal memories, feeling gravity stabilize around her as she worked. [606]

The diviners would wonder why the fluctuations ceased. [615] They would read their coffee grounds and find only her absence, another deletion, another transformed thing. [631]

But Maris would be walking the docks inside the memory-crystals, lighting lanterns beside her grandmother in the gleaming silence of recovered time, where everything lost finally settled into pattern and permanence. [660]

She pressed the crystals to her chest and let the whale's heart close around her, salt and memory crystallizing together, while far above, the lanterns burned steady through the night. [689]

The gravity, at last, held true. [695]
