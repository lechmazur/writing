The fortress walls wept after the rain, and Chef Maron pressed his bare hand against the ancient stone, feeling the echo of a hundred years of regret. [28] His gift—or curse—had always let him taste memories in food, but here in the Sahel Fortress, touching wet sandstone made him shudder with the stored remorse of soldiers who'd died defending these walls. [59] The emotion was contagious, spreading through his fingertips like frost, threatening to subsume his own identity beneath their collective grief. [80]

He pulled away, steadying himself against the parapet. [88] The dream that had brought him here—unspoken, recurring, insistent—was finally ending its hold on him. [104] In it, he'd seen the coral icebound pavilion beneath the dunes, impossible and real, pulsing with frozen memories that needed tasting, smoothing, forgetting. [128]

"You feel it too," said Amira, the fortress's last keeper, approaching without touching him. [142] She knew about contagion. [146] Everyone here did. [150]

"Three days I've been analyzing the tidal pool formations in the canyon," Maron said, his voice sturdy despite the brittle edge of exhaustion. [172] "The rain revealed them—salt pools that shouldn't exist this far inland." [184] He turned to face her. [189] "They're pathways, aren't they? [193] To what's below." [196]

Amira nodded, her weathered face impassive. [202] "The pavilion has been waiting since the ocean left us, ten thousand years ago." [217] She gestured toward the canyon where temporary streams still trickled between red rocks. [231] "Some memories are too sharp to bear. [238] We store them there, in the coral ice, where they can't cut us anymore." [253]

"But they're rotting," Maron said. [258] "I can taste it in the air, in the water, in the bread you served me yesterday." [276] He'd nearly wept eating that bread, overwhelmed by the ancient sorrow baked into every grain grown in this poisoned soil. [297] "The stored remorse is leaking. [302] Soon it will subsume everything—every person, every thought, every moment of joy you have left." [318]

"That's why you're here," Amira said quietly. [325] "To sandpaper the rough memories smooth. [332] To make them bearable again." [337]

The descent took hours. [341] The tidal pools formed a staircase of salt and memory, each one revealing itself only after Maron analyzed its formation—the way crystals grew, the direction of ancient currents, the temperature differentials that spoke of depths below. [376] His chef's training served him here: reading patterns, understanding chemistry, trusting his senses even when logic failed. [392]

The pavilion materialized in the darkness like a ghost of the Cretaceous, its coral pillars encased in impossible ice that couldn't exist at these temperatures, in this place. [417] But it did exist, because memory made its own rules. [428] Because remorse, stored long enough, created its own climate. [437]

Maron removed his gloves. [441] This required touch. [444]

The first pillar burned against his palm—a mother's grief for a child lost to thirst. [460] He tasted it: bitter almonds, spoiled milk, the metallic tang of desperation. [473] Carefully, he worked the memory like dough, kneading away the sharpest edges, softening the texture until it became something survivable. [493] Not forgotten—never forgotten—but no longer a knife in the dark. [505]

The emotion tried to pour into him, to make him subsume it entirely, to drown in someone else's ancient pain. [525] But Moran had spent years learning to touch without being consumed. [537] He was sturdy in his boundaries, even as the memories remained brittle in his hands. [553]

He moved from pillar to pillar through the frozen pavilion, touching, tasting, smoothing. [566] Each memory he sandpapered became translucent, lighter, its stored remorse transformed into something closer to wistful acceptance. [583] The ice began to melt. [588] The coral began to breathe. [593]

When he emerged at dawn, the fortress no longer wept. [604] Amira stood waiting, and when she took his hand to help him up the final step, he felt only her gratitude—clean, simple, warm. [628]

The unspoken dream was over. [633] The memories below would hold for another age. [642] And Maron finally understood why some gifts required the desert, the rain, and the courage to touch what everyone else had learned to fear. [668]

He tasted salt on his lips and smiled. [676] It was only tears—his own, this time, and bearable. [687]
