The amber pavilion stood at the edge of town, its glass panels catching the late afternoon light like captured fire. [19] Mara had come here every day across the melting of winter's last snow, watching the world transition from white silence to the first brave greens of spring. [47] She was a mural artist by trade, known for her vivid depictions of nocturnal gardens, but lately her work had stalled. [68] The question that haunted her—why certain flowers bloom only at night—had become an obsession she couldn't paint her way through. [88]

Inside the pavilion, she spread her collection of old postcards across the hexagonal table, each one showing night-blooming cereus from different decades, different countries. [112] Her grandmother had gathered them over a lifetime, and Mara had inherited both the collection and the question. [129] The postcards were yellowed with age, their corners soft, but the flowers depicted remained luminous even in faded ink. [148]

"You're here again," came a voice from the doorway. [157] Father Benedict stood backlit by the amber glass, his outline soft and indistinct. [171] He was the keeper of St. Margaret's Cathedral, whose famous windows Mara had studied for months. [187]

"I'm trying to reckon with something," Mara said, touching the nearest postcard. [200] "Why beauty would choose darkness." [206]

The priest moved closer, his footsteps quiet on the wooden floor. [218] He was quietly driven in his own way, she'd learned—a man who spent hours examining the hidden layers of etched glass in a cathedral window, understanding how light could be transformed by what it passed through. [254]

"Have you considered," he said gently, "that perhaps night isn't darkness to the flower?" [269]

Mara looked up at him, then back at her postcards. [279] The pavilion was emptying of visitors as evening approached, leaving them in what she thought of as a dawning hush—that particular silence when the world pauses between states of being. [310]

"The windows at St. Margaret's," Father Benedict continued, settling into a chair across from her, "they seem simple from the nave. [330] But when you examine them closely, through the hidden layers of etched glass in a cathedral window, you see how many transparencies work together. [354] The lead artist layered them—clear, then amber, then pearl—so the light would change throughout the day. [372] Morning light reveals saints. [376] Afternoon light reveals angels. [380] And at night, with only candles behind them, they reveal stars." [392]

Mara gathered her postcards slowly, arranging them in a new pattern. [404] "You're saying the flower knows something we don't about its own light." [418]

"I'm saying that what we call darkness might be the flower's perfect illumination," he replied with umbral tenderness. [437] "The moon is no less light for being gentler than the sun. [451] And some truths only reveal themselves in shadow." [460]

Outside, true dusk was falling across the autumn grounds. [470] The pavilion's amber panels deepened to copper, then bronze. [480] Mara thought about her murals, how she'd been trying to paint night-blooming flowers as defiant creatures choosing the hard path. [501] But what if they were simply opening to their proper sun? [513]

"My grandmother," she said quietly, "she wrote on the back of one postcard that she hoped I would understand why flowers bloom at night." [537] She found it in the stack, turned it over. [548] The handwriting was spidery but clear: *Some of us are moon-rooted, darling. [561] That's not sadness—that's knowing your own sky.* [569]

Father Benedict smiled. [572] "She sounds wise." [575]

Mara stood, gathering her postcards with new purpose. [584] She could already see the mural forming in her mind—not flowers defying darkness, but flowers drinking in their element, their petals like small cups raised to receive a gentler star. [616] The amber pavilion had taught her what the cathedral windows had shown Father Benedict: that beauty reveals itself in layers, and sometimes you must look through different glass to understand the light. [649]

"Thank you," she said. [653]

As she stepped into the autumn evening, the first stars were appearing overhead, and somewhere in a garden she couldn't see, the night-blooming flowers were beginning their slow unfurling, opening to greet their rightful sun. [687]

She finally knew what to paint. [694]
