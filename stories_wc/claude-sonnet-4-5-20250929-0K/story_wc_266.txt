The ferry guides wore their years like polished driftwood, smooth and salt-silvered. [12] They stood at the veiled ridgeway where mountain mist met ocean fog, waiting as they always did in the hour between dog and wolf. [34] Mara arrived breathless, clutching the torn leather leash still warm from her dog's collar. [48]

"She's been gone three days," Mara whispered, her voice breaking like foam on stones. [62] "I held on too tight, and when the leash finally snapped, she just ran." [77]

The older guide, whose name might have been Thomas or might have been something the wind knew better, nodded with understanding that required no response. [102] His companion, a woman whose eyes held the gray-green of deep water, produced a ticket punch from her weathered satchel. [122] It was brass and ancient, its handle worn smooth by countless hands, and when she pressed it into Mara's palm, the star-shaped hole at its center seemed to hold a fragment of twilight. [152]

"The direct path won't lead you to what you're seeking," the woman said, her tone as gentle and persistent as waves reshaping shore stones. [175] "What you've lost isn't your dog, child. [183] It's something that bolted when the leash broke—something that's been leashed far longer than three days." [199]

Mara wanted to argue, to insist she only needed help finding Luna, but the guides were already moving along the ridgeway, and she found herself following. [223] Through indirect routes they led her, not down toward the beaches where she'd already searched, but upward where the path disappeared into veiling mists. [246]

The ticket punch grew warm in her hand. [254] Each time they paused at a crossroads of fog and fern, the older guide would gesture for her to use it—to punch through leaves, to press it against tree bark, to let starlight through its center illuminate their way. [292]

"I don't understand," Mara said as they traversed another slope that seemed to lead nowhere practical. [308] "How does this find Luna?" [313]

"Tell us about before the leash broke," the woman guide said, settling onto a moss-covered stone to keep their vigil in the deepening twilight. [334] "Tell us about all the times you almost let go." [345]

So Mara spoke, her words tumbling out like a confession to the dimming sky. [359] She told them about the job she'd refused because it required travel, about the man she'd loved who'd wanted adventure while she'd craved safety, about the art she'd abandoned because creating felt too much like stepping off solid ground. [395] Luna had been her anchor, her excuse, her tether to a life that felt manageable and small. [412]

"And when the leash broke?" [417] the older guide asked, gently persistent. [423]

"I felt terrified," Mara admitted. [428] "But also—" She paused, surprised by her own truth. [437] "Also lighter." [439]

The woman guide smiled, a expression like moonlight on water. [449] "The courage you need has been waiting, unused, all this time. [460] Your dog knew it. [464] That's why she ran—not away from you, but toward something." [475]

They stood together in the thickening dusk, and Mara raised the ticket punch to the sky. [491] Through its star-shaped center, she saw not the ridgeway's mist but a clearer path, one she'd never dared traverse. [510] She understood then that this wasn't about finding Luna—it was about following her. [524]

"She's waiting where the unused courage waits," the older guide said, his voice a shoreline lullaby, rhythmic and sure. [543] "But you'll have to walk there without a leash." [553]

Mara nodded, pocketing the punch like a promise. [561] The guides began to fade into the twilight, their work complete, dissolving like sea foam into the evening air. [579] She stood alone on the veiled ridgeway, the broken leash still in one hand, a star-shaped hole in the other, and for the first time in years, she felt ready to run. [609]

Down from the ridge she went, not back toward home but forward through the gathering dark, following the indirect routes that fear had always forbidden, traversing at last toward where both her dog and her courage had been waiting all along. [647]

The twilight deepened into night, and Mara ran on. [656]
