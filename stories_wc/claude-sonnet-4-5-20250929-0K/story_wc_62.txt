The gravestone carver arrived at the ancient greenhouse as the first monarchs settled on the rusted glass panels overhead. [19] She carried her tools in a leather satchel and a roll of woven ribbon her grandmother had given her three migrations ago. [41] The ribbon bore words from poems traded across generations of family dinners, each verse inked in a different hand. [60]

Marcus had summoned her here, though Marcus had been dead for seven months. [73]

She'd carved his stone herself, choosing limestone for its willingness to hold fine detail. [87] His epitaph came from a Neruda poem he'd recited the last dinner they'd shared, before the cancer silenced his voice. [107] But the carving hadn't brought closure—only more questions about how sorrow moved through bloodlines, how it changed shape across time. [128]

Inside the greenhouse, tomato vines grew wild among cracked Victorian planters. [138] Dusk filtered through amber and green glass, creating pools of copper light. [150] The monarchs outside began their thundering calm, thousands of wings beating in disciplined silence as they prepared for the night. [170]

"You're retracing old paths," Marcus said. [176]

His form materialized between the overgrown herbs, translucent as morning mist. [187] She didn't startle—she'd felt him here for weeks, pulling at her attention whenever she passed the abandoned structure. [205]

"I'm trying to understand," she said, unrolling the ribbon across a weathered potting bench. [219] "Why some griefs echo louder than others. [226] Why yours won't let me rest." [232]

Marcus drifted closer, studying the ribbon's inscribed verses. [240] "Because you're carrying more than mine," he said. [249] "Read them again. [252] Really read them." [255]

She began with her great-grandfather's contribution, a Whitman passage about grass growing from graves. [268] Then her grandmother's Dickinson, her father's Szymborska, her mother's Angelou. [279] Marcus had always brought García Lorca, those fierce meditations on death that somehow celebrated life. [293]

"Our family custom," she whispered. [298] "Trading poems at dinner. [302] I thought it was about beauty." [308]

"It was about this," Marcus said, his spectral form settling into stillness. [320] "Teaching each other how to hold loss. [327] Preparing for it. [330] The poems were practice." [334]

She traced the letters with her fingertips, feeling suddenly the weight of every family member who'd chosen their verse knowing someday it would become epitaph. [358] The ribbon was a map of anticipated grief, each poem a way of saying: when I'm gone, remember me like this. [379]

"You wanted to discover the shape of collective grief," Marcus continued. [390] "But you were looking in the wrong place. [398] Not in the stones you carve for strangers. [406] In this." [408] He gestured toward the ribbon. [413] "In how we taught each other to survive the unsurvivable." [423]

Through the greenhouse glass, the monarchs began to lift again, their migration patterns written in orange and black across the dying light. [344] They moved as one organism, individual griefs merged into collective motion, each butterfly both alone and part of something larger. [366]

"The stones you carve," Marcus said, "you approach them too carefully. [377] Too separately. [379] Each one isolated." [382]

She understood then. [385] Her work had been treating each death as singular tragedy, when grief was actually a continuous thread—like the ribbon, like the butterflies' ancient routes, like poems passed hand to hand across decades of dinners. [418]

"Show me how," she said. [423]

Marcus spent the remaining light teaching her to see monuments differently. [434] Not endpoints but waypoints in an ongoing conversation between the living and dead. [447] He showed her how to carve so stones spoke to each other, creating gardens of collective memory rather than isolated markers. [467] The greenhouse became their studio, his spectral hands guiding hers through new techniques, teaching her to retrace the lines between individual loss and communal sorrow. [491]

When the last butterfly departed weeks later, Marcus began to fade. [502]

"Will you trade me a poem?" [508] she asked. [510]

"You already have it," he said, gesturing to the ribbon where his Lorca verse waited. [525] "Add your own now. [529] For whoever needs your mentorship next." [535]

She watched him dissolve into the settling darkness, the greenhouse suddenly just an abandoned structure again. [550] But she understood now what she was meant to carve: not individual grief, but its larger architecture—the way sorrow moved through families like butterfly migrations, ancient and purposeful. [576]

She rolled up the ribbon, selected a pen, and began to write her own poem in the remaining space. [595]

It began: "We are the carvers of each other's remembering." [605]
