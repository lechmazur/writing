The floating rock dojo spun slowly through the void, tethered to nothing, anchored by meditation alone. [16] Kira sat cross-legged on the obsidian platform, staring at the glass jar between her and her clone. [33] Inside floated a brain, pristine and wrinkled, labeled "DUPLICATE" in her own handwriting from before the dissolution. [50]

"We can't both raise her," Clone-Kira said, her voice identical yet foreign. [62] "The court needs a decision." [68]

The child—their daughter, created from shared genetic material before Kira's ego death—played in the adjacent chamber, unaware her mothers were fragmenting. [87] Kira remembered being whole once, remembered the arrogance of believing consciousness was singular, indivisible. [101] Then the meditation accident had shattered her, scattered her across probability streams, and when she'd reassembled, nothing felt real anymore. [121]

"You still feel things," Kira said, slicing through the pretense of civility. [133] "I came back wrong." [137]

Clone-Kira reached for the jar, cradling it. [145] "This was supposed to be our backup. [153] Your backup. [156] But you copied yourself twice that day, didn't you? [166] Once to the jar, once to me—a living vessel." [176]

The dojo rotated, and through the transparent floor, Kira watched history rewrite itself in the quantum foam below. [193] Timelines branched and merged like neural pathways, each decision creating new pasts to justify new presents. [208] She'd learned to see it after ego death, this constant revision of causality. [222] It should have been enlightening. [227] Instead, it made everything meaningless. [232]

"I don't love her," Kira admitted, the words ash in her mouth. [244] "I know I should. [249] I remember loving her—the memory is there, intact—but I don't feel it." [262] She gestured at the neural tissue floating in its preservative bath. [274] "Maybe that part stayed in the jar." [282]

Clone-Kira's eyes glistened. [286] "Then let me have her. [292] Let me be enough." [297]

"No." [298] Kira stood, and the platform adjusted to her weight, maintaining perfect balance. [311] "I need her. [315] Not for love. [319] For the opposite." [323]

She approached the jar, lifted it. [330] The brain inside shifted, settling. [336] "Master Chen taught us that wholeness comes through complementary opposites. [346] Light needs dark. [350] Form needs void. [354] Maybe feeling needs numbness to define itself." [362]

Clone-Kira rose, defensive. [366] "You can't experiment with our daughter's life." [374]

"Not experiment—vivify." [377] Kira held the jar before her like an offering. [388] "I'm dead inside, yes, but I see clearly now. [398] You feel everything too intensely, always drowning in emotion. [407] You'll smother her with anxiety, project every fear onto her future." [419] She met her clone's eyes. [426] "Separately, we're both disasters. [431] Together, we balance." [435]

"Joint custody?" [437] Clone-Kira laughed bitterly. [441] "The court wanted a clean answer." [448]

"Courts want simplicity. [452] Judges want narratives that fit precedent." [459] Kira set the jar down carefully between them again. [469] "But look around us. [474] We're on a rock floating in nothing, while history rewrites itself every moment, while I exist in three forms simultaneously." [493] She pressed her palm against the cold glass. [502] "Nothing about us is simple." [508]

Clone-Kira knelt, mirroring Kira's posture. [514] They flanked the brain, two versions of the same woman who'd tried to transcend limitation and instead had fragmented into philosophical problem. [533]

"I need to defeat this numbness," Kira said quietly. [543] "Not overcome it—use it. [548] Channel it. [551] My emptiness can hold space for her storms. [560] Your passion can warm my void. [567] We're complementary opposites." [571]

The child's laughter echoed from the other chamber, pure and uncomplicated. [582]

Clone-Kira extended her hand across the jar. [590] "If you fail her, if this cold vision of yours freezes her—" [603]

"Then your fire melts me." [609] Kira gripped her clone's hand. [616] "That's the point. [620] That's the balance." [624]

The dojo completed its rotation, and somewhere below, history shuffled itself into a new configuration where this outcome had always been inevitable. [644] Two mothers, one child, a brain in a jar labeled with honest uncertainty. [657]

Not simple. [660]

Not clean. [663]

But vivified. [666]

Whole. [668]
