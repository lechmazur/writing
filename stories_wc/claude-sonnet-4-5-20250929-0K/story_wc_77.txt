The funhouse mirrors reflected nothing but dust motes dancing in pale moonlight, and Margot knew the resuscitation had changed her in ways she couldn't yet name. [27] Three days after drowning in the carnival's forgotten duck pond, she'd awakened with an affliction the nurses whispered about—photographically cursed, capturing in her mind's eye every shadow, every angle, every awful detail with perfect, inescapable clarity. [63] Now she stood before the warped glass, watching her distorted face multiply into infinity, each reflection burning itself permanently into her memory. [86]

"You came back for a reason," the whispering advisor said, materializing beside her like condensation forming on cold metal. [106] His voice had the quality of silk dragging across gravel, simultaneously revolting and magnetic. [122] No one knew his real name; he'd haunted the abandoned carnival since before Margot was born, offering counsel to those desperate enough to seek him. [147]

Margot clutched the opera cloak clasp she'd found gripped in her dead hand when they'd pulled her from the water—a strange artifact of tarnished silver shaped like a screaming face. [178] It radiated what she'd come to think of as lingering luminance, a faint glow visible only in her cursed photographic memory, persisting long after she looked away. [205]

"I need to understand what fear wants from me," she said, her voice echoing through the funhouse's twisted corridors. [225] "Since I came back, I'm afraid of everything—breathing, sleeping, even thinking. [237] It's consuming me." [240]

The advisor's smile was a wound opening. [247] "Fear has weaknesses, like any predator. [253] But to expose them, you must trick it into revealing itself." [265] He produced a slim volume from his coat, its leather cover mottled with age. [280] "A dream dictionary. [283] Not the common kind." [287]

Margot opened it, her cursed sight immediately capturing every paradoxical note scrawled in the margins. [303] Under "Water": *To drown is to breathe deeply for the first time.* [317] Under "Mirror": *Reflections show what you are; shadows show what you'll become.* [331] Under "Fear": *That which runs from itself will eventually circle back and give chase.* [347]

"I don't understand," Margot said, but the advisor was already fading into the funhouse's grotesque shadows. [364]

She spent hours wandering the decaying attraction, the opera cloak clasp growing warm in her palm, its lingering luminance brightening in her mind until it seemed to pulse with her heartbeat. [393] The dream dictionary's contradictions gnawed at her thoughts. [402] Finally, in the hall of mirrors, she began to unbosom herself to her own reflections—speaking aloud every terror that had gripped her since the resuscitation. [428]

"I'm afraid of water because I drowned in it," she said. [440] "I'm afraid of breathing because I stopped." [448] With each confession, she watched her photographically cursed memory capture the scene—but something was changing. [464] The reflections weren't just showing her fear; they were showing fear itself, a separate entity hovering behind her shoulder, its form becoming clearer as she spoke. [491]

It was small. [494] Pathetically small. [496]

The paradoxical notes suddenly made sense. [502] Fear wasn't the massive force crushing her—it was a tiny parasite that only seemed large because she kept running from it, never turning to look at its actual size. [533] By unbosoming herself completely, speaking every dread into the open air, she'd tricked it into materializing where her cursed sight could capture it truthfully. [558]

The opera cloak clasp flared hot, and Margot understood its purpose. [569] She fastened it to her collar, feeling its weight settle against her throat. [583] The screaming face on the clasp wasn't expressing fear—it was fear itself, trapped in silver, its weakness finally exposed. [604]

The whispering advisor's laughter drifted through the funhouse, repulsive in its satisfaction yet alluring in its promise of freedom. [624] "Now you know," his voice echoed. [630] "What we fear most is seeing fear clearly." [638]

Margot walked out of the carnival, her photographic curse now a weapon, carrying the clasp like a trophy. [656] Behind her, the funhouse lights flickered with lingering luminance, and the mirrors reflected nothing at all. [673]
