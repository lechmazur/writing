The letterpress operator worked under a ceiling of vanishing stars, their light dimming one by one as the universe slowly compressed. [20] In her topaz workshop, the amber walls pulsed with bioluminescent veins that responded to her shifting moods, creating patterns she could never quite replicate. [43] She was arranging type when the messenger arrived with the halo fragment—a curved shard of crystallized light that hummed with residual divinity. [66]

"From the Seraph Collapse," the messenger said, setting it beside her lead types. [79] "Payment for the empathy work." [85]

After he left, she held the fragment close, feeling its warmth against her sternum. [99] The operator had no name of her own anymore—she'd borrowed so many personalities over the years that her original self had dissolved like sugar in rain. [126] Today she wore the anxious precision of a clockmaker, yesterday the languid confidence of a river guide. [144] Each borrowed identity helped her understand another facet of the mathematics she sought: the terrible, beautiful equations that governed how hearts break and mend. [169]

She placed the halo fragment into her press, setting it among the metal letters like a jewel in a crown. [189] The workshop's topaz walls brightened, responding to her intention. [199] She began composing a message, but not in any language the messenger would recognize. [214] Through deliberate ambiguity, she arranged words that meant three different things depending on how light struck them, phrases that shifted between comfort and threat, hope and despair. [240] This was her gift: to disorient readers so completely that their defenses collapsed, allowing her to transpose their empathy from one person to another. [263]

The press descended with a mechanical sigh. [270] When she lifted it, the paper showed not ink but emotional residue—the crystallized feelings of everyone who had touched the halo fragment before its bearer's fall. [296] Grief, certainly. [298] Loneliness like a frozen lake. [303] But also: joy sharp as broken glass, love that tasted of copper and rain. [317]

She'd been collecting these emotional signatures for decades, trying to map their relationships. [330] If she could understand the mathematics of emotion—the precise angle at which hope transforms into delusion, the rate at which affection decays into resentment—perhaps she could predict the next collapse. [359] Perhaps she could save the remaining stars. [366]

Above, another light winked out. [371] The universe was contracting, they said, curling back into itself like a dying flower. [385] Between these vanishing stars, time moved strangely—thick and viscous as honey, then sudden and sharp as shattering ice. [404] She'd learned to work in these fluctuating moments, to press meaning into paper while reality held its breath. [422]

Tonight she borrowed the personality of a mathematician she'd met during the first stellar collapse—his patient wonder, his belief that everything could be reduced to elegant proofs. [448] She arranged the emotional data from the halo fragment into columns and rows, seeking patterns. [463] The grief here created resonance with the loneliness there. [473] The joy, surprisingly, shared structural similarities with rage. [482] Both were acts of reaching beyond oneself. [489]

Her hands moved faster, setting type, pressing, examining. [497] The topaz walls pulsed in synchronization with her heartbeat—or was it the borrowed heartbeat, the mathematician's steady rhythm? [516] She could no longer tell where she ended and her assumed identities began. [530] Perhaps that was the point. [535] Perhaps true empathy required this dissolution, this willingness to become a vessel for others' experiences. [550]

The halo fragment grew warmer, brighter. [556] On the paper before her, the emotional equations finally aligned into something approaching comprehensibility. [570] She saw it then: emotions weren't separate variables but different expressions of the same underlying force, the way light and heat were both electromagnetic radiation. [594] Love equaled fear plus hope divided by distance. [603] Grief was joy multiplied by loss, squared. [611]

Another star vanished. [614] She pressed the halo fragment between two fresh sheets of paper, creating an impression that glowed with lucid turbulence—clear yet chaotic, ordered yet wild. [636] When she held it up, the topaz workshop reflected her smile—someone else's smile, borrowed from a person who'd believed mathematics could save them all. [660]

Outside, the stars continued their slow disappearance. [668] Inside, surrounded by letters and fragments of fallen angels, the operator worked on, habitually trying on new souls, seeking the equation that might explain why hearts insisted on feeling anything at all. [698]

The press descended again, steady as a heartbeat, patient as the mathematics of the dying sky. [715]
