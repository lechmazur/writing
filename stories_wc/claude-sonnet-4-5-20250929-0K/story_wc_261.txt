The morphine fog lifted as dawn touched the tower's eastern windows, and Mara woke to the familiar throb of her reopened wrist. [22] She'd picked at the scars again during surgery recovery, the ones she'd promised Dr. Venn she would leave alone. [40] But how could she learn to read their stories if she kept them covered, kept them smooth, kept them silent? [60]

The tower had been quiet for three hundred years before she'd arrived, a research station abandoned when the meteor passed close enough to hush all electromagnetic frequencies within a fifty-mile radius. [91] No phones, no computers, only the slow communication of living things. [102] That's when Mara discovered she could hear the plants. [111]

Not hear, exactly. [114] More like feel their slow thoughts pressing against her mind, patient and green. [127] The ivy climbing the tower's stone walls remembered centuries. [136] The moss had stories deeper than soil. [144] And Mara, who had spent five years searching for closure after her sister's disappearance, had finally found witnesses who couldn't lie. [164]

She rose from the cot, steadying herself against the wall, and approached her workspace. [177] Coffee rings overlapped on the wooden table like sedimentary layers, each one a record of sleepless nights spent questioning the clematis, interrogating the ferns. [200] She'd learned to read the patterns in the dried coffee, how the rings revealed timelines, how the breaks in their circles showed where memories fractured. [224]

The frosted hourglass sat beside her notes, its sand frozen mid-fall by the meteor's passing—a displaced miracle, the locals called it. [244] Time had stopped for the sand but nothing else, a contradiction that shouldn't exist but did. [259] Like her sister's body, found three months ago in a place it couldn't possibly be, wearing clothes she'd donated to charity years before she vanished. [283]

Mara lifted her wrist to the dawn light, examining the fresh blood on the surgical tape. [298] She'd asked them to open the old wound during the procedure, to cut deeper, to expose the scar tissue beneath. [317] The nurses had looked horrified, but Dr. Venn understood. [327] Some scars wrote themselves in layers. [333]

Outside, the climbing roses pressed their ancient consciousness against her thoughts. [344] They'd been here when the research station was built, when the meteor passed, when her sister stumbled through these woods five years ago, confused and seeking help. [368] The roses had tried to guide her, bending their branches toward the tower, but Sarah had been afraid of thorns. [387] She'd gone the other way, toward the collapsed mine shaft. [397]

Mara had spent weeks learning to tunnel through the roses' memories, pushing past the surface impressions to the deep root-knowledge where truth lived. [417] She'd seen Sarah fall, had felt the roses' frustration at their immobility, their silent screaming. [432] But she'd also felt something else, something the roses didn't understand: a warmth, a presence, someone else in the woods that night. [452]

She studied the coffee rings again, comparing them to her sketches of the roses' timeline. [466] There—a gap in the pattern where two memories should connect but didn't. [478] A space where someone had been edited out, deliberately forgotten. [488]

Her wrist throbbed as she pressed her scarred palm against the table. [500] The wood was old enough to remember, and under the meteor's hush, everything living shared its secrets if you knew how to listen. [522] The table had been built from trees that once grew where the mine shaft collapsed. [537] It had memories of being forest, of watching, of witnessing. [548]

And there it was, finally: Dr. Venn, younger, helping someone stumble through the woods. [561] Not helping—dragging. [564] Sarah fighting, falling, disappearing into darkness. [570] Then nothing, until three months ago when he'd needed to move her, when the mine was scheduled for demolition. [588]

Mara picked up the frosted hourglass, feeling its impossible weight. [598] Some miracles displaced more than sand. [604] Some wounds needed opening before they could tell you where the bodies were buried, before you could stop seeking closure and start seeking justice. [627] She pressed the hourglass against her reopened wrist, letting her blood christen its frozen surface. [642]

The roses would testify. [646] The table would remember. [650] Even the coffee rings held their truth in circular patterns that never quite closed. [664] And Mara, accidentally telepathic in the meteor's eternal hush, would finally learn to read the complete story written in her sister's absence, in her own scars, in the quiet tower at dawn. [695]

Some wounds opened themselves. [699]
