The mist rolled through the abandoned rail depot like breath through lungs, and Mara stood perfectly still, listening to the mechanical hummingbird stutter in her palm. [28]

She had been blind for three years now, ever since the welding accident that had taken her sight but sharpened everything else. [50]

Her repair shop occupied the old stationmaster's office, where copper pipes still threaded through walls and water features she'd installed herself created a geography of sound. [75]

The artificial hummingbird drone belonged to Captain Voss, whose cargo vessel was scheduled for its maiden voyage within the hour. [95]

"The guidance system is compromised," she said, her voice carrying that magnetic calm that put nervous clients at ease. [113]

"It keeps circling back to the ship instead of scouting ahead." [124]

Voss shifted his weight, boots scraping stone. [131]

"Can you fix it before we launch?" [138]

Mara moved to her workbench, where a shallow basin held water that cycled through a series of glass channels. [157]

She had designed this feature specifically to decode feedback into direction—the water's movement created subtle temperature changes and acoustic signatures that revealed what her eyes could no longer see. [186]

She held the drone above the flowing water, feeling its vibrations translate through the surface. [201]

Light from the depot's high windows—she knew they were high because of how sounds echoed differently throughout the day—passed through the water, and the drone's sensors responded. [229]

"It's trying to read refraction patterns," she murmured, fingers finding the access panel. [242]

"But something in the calibration is inverted." [249]

She oversees all repairs this way, examining how light bends through water to diagnose what's broken in machines designed to see. [269]

Her fingertips found the microscopically damaged crystal lens, a hairline fracture invisible to most but obvious once you understood how the drone was misinterpreting the world. [294]

Outside, the deep resonance of a ship's horn rolled through the mist. [306]

The anchor lifting, chains clanking against iron—Voss's maiden voyage beginning. [316]

"I'm out of time," he said, tension cracking his voice. [326]

"You're not leaving yet," Mara replied, already reaching for her tools. [337]

She was a heartfelt artisan, someone who had rebuilt her entire life around making broken things whole. [353]

Every repair was personal, a promise that damage didn't mean the end. [365]

She worked with practiced precision, applying a polymer patch to the fractured lens, using the water feature to test the refraction angles in real-time. [388]

The drone's wingbeats shifted, smoothed, found their proper rhythm. [397]

When she held it above the basin again, the acoustic feedback changed—clearer, purposeful. [410]

"The sensors are reading correctly now," she said. [418]

"The refraction through atmospheric moisture will guide it properly." [427]

She handed the drone back to Voss, their fingers brushing briefly. [438]

"Test it before you lose sight of shore," she added. [448]

Voss took the hummingbird reverently, cupping it like something sacred. [458]

"How do you do this?" he asked. [465]

"Work in the dark, I mean. [471]

Oversee repairs when you can't see?" [477]

Mara smiled, turning toward the sound of his voice with uncanny accuracy. [489]

"I don't work in darkness," she said. [496]

"I work in a different kind of light. [504]

Water refracts it, sound carries it, temperature holds it." [513]

She gestured to her shop, where pipes hummed and water sang through glass channels. [527]

"Everything broken has a signature. [532]

You just need to know how to listen." [540]

Another horn blast, closer now—the ship preparing to depart. [550]

Voss nodded, though she couldn't see it, and she smiled because she could feel his understanding in the silence. [568]

"Thank you," he said, and meant it in ways that went beyond the repair. [582]

After he left, Mara stood in her mist-coated depot, surrounded by her water features and salvaged rail equipment, listening to the ship's engines fade into the harbor's morning chorus. [609]

She ran her fingers through the flowing water, feeling its cool certainty, decoding its feedback into direction. [625]

Somewhere out there, a mechanical hummingbird was flying true, patched and whole, scouting ahead through the mist. [641]

And here, in her repair shop built from railway bones and running water, Mara understood that being broken and being blind were just different ways of seeing the world. [667]

She returned to her workbench, where three more damaged drones awaited her attention, each one a small promise that everything lost could be found again, if you knew where to look. [695]

The mist thickened as morning aged, and in the cathedral silence of the old depot, Mara worked with her heartfelt precision, making the broken world whole again, one small repair at a time. [726]
