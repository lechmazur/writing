The withdrawn knight had not spoken to another soul in three years when he found the program tucked inside his gauntlet. [21] It advertised a marionette theater that had closed decades before he was born, its faded ink promising "Wonders Beyond the Strings." [43] He stood in the alchemical orchard greenhouse, where fruit-laden branches glowed with factually mystical light—not metaphorical enchantment, but verified sorcery documented in the ledgers of the Order he'd abandoned. [71] The greenhouse existed in endless night, a bubble of perpetual darkness the alchemists had cultivated to force their specimens into strange new forms. [93]

Reality shifted around him like breathing. [99] One moment, the apples overhead were golden and humming; the next, they dripped silver and sang in harmonics that made his teeth ache. [122] The knight had come here seeking solitude after his disgrace, but solitude had taught him only to watch. [141] Now he watched the trees reorganize themselves according to forgotten patterns—geometries the first alchemists had used before the Order standardized everything into rigid formulae. [165]

The marionette program shouldn't exist in his gauntlet. [173] He'd checked the armor obsessively each dawn, a ritual from his training days. [186] Yet here it was, warm as if fresh from a printer's press. [199] The paper showed a illustration of a knight identical to him, strings ascending from his limbs into darkness above. [217] Beneath, in script so small he had to remove his helmet to read it: "Speak the oath you never finished." [237]

He remembered. [239] Six years ago, during his investiture, he'd begun the Oath of Eternal Vigilance before the Grand Commander. [256] Halfway through the third verse—the part about capturing the shape of possibility in service to the realm—he'd stopped. [275] His voice had simply ceased, as if someone had unsnapped the connection between thought and speech. [291] The other knights claimed he'd dishonored himself through cowardice. [301] Only he knew the truth: he'd seen the strings. [311]

They'd descended from nowhere, gossamer filaments attached to every knight in the ceremony, pulling them through the words, through the gestures, through lives not their own. [335] He'd fled rather than complete the oath, fled to this greenhouse where the alchemists had promised him silence and shadow. [356]

Now the program trembled in his hand as reality shifted again. [367] The trees bent into an amphitheater around him, their branches forming a stage. [381] Above, in the eternal darkness, he sensed movement—vast wooden crossbars, strings dangling, waiting. [395]

"I see you," he murmured, and the words felt like allegiance. [407] Not to the Order, but to something older, something that understood the theater of duty and the performance of honor. [427] The strings had always been there; the marionette masters simply made them visible. [441]

The shivering bliss started in his fingertips. [448] It spread up his arms as he began to move through forgotten patterns, the ceremonial positions the First Knights had used before oaths became standardized. [471] These movements captured possibility itself—the space between what was and what could be. [486] He unsnapped his breastplate, letting it fall, then his pauldrons. [497] Each piece of armor hit the greenhouse floor with sounds like curtains closing. [510]

Above, the crossbars rotated, and he felt the strings attach. [521] But they didn't pull. [525] They waited. [527]

He completed the ancient pattern, his body remembering what the Order had forgotten: that true knights didn't serve through forced allegiance but through chosen motion. [550] The strings would always be there—on everyone, connecting them to fate and duty and the invisible choreographers of history. [570] The question was whether you moved with eyes open or closed. [582]

The marionette program dissolved in his hand, its purpose fulfilled. [592] Around him, the alchemical fruit blazed with light that pushed back the endless night. [607] Reality shifted one final time, and he saw the greenhouse for what it truly was: a stage where possibility took shape through those brave enough to acknowledge their strings while dancing anyway. [639]

He began to murmur the oath again, his own version, as the trees swayed in patterns no standardized formula could predict. [660] Above, the vast marionette master—whatever cosmic force it was—waited with infinite patience for his performance. [677]

And the withdrawn knight, no longer withdrawn, danced in shivering bliss through the dark. [691]
