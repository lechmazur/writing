The surgery had stripped Marcus of everything except the knowledge that he'd once been someone worth forgetting. [18] He stood at the edge of the underground lake, its bioluminescent algae casting blue-green shadows across the cavern walls, turning the stone into something delicately robust—ancient yet trembling with fragile life. [51] The procedure was supposed to give him a clean slate, but the doctors couldn't erase the shape of guilt, only its specifics. [73]

He'd come here following instructions hidden in the newspaper classifieds, reading between the lines of ads for lost pets and used furniture. [95] "Beneath the old stadium, past the third tunnel, where light grows from darkness"—the message had been clear to someone who'd learned to live in codes. [120] Marcus needed answers about who he'd been, not to remember, but to ensure he never became that person again. [140]

The lake stretched into darkness, its glowing waters revealing nothing of its depths. [153] A wooden dock extended into the phosphorescent expanse, and sitting at its end was a woman with silver hair and eyes that had seen too much. [178] She held something cradled in her hands. [186]

"You're the one they call the Interpreter," Marcus said, his voice echoing off the cavern ceiling. [202]

"And you're the one who thinks forgetting absolves," she replied, her tone carrying jaded wonder, as if she'd witnessed every permutation of human nature and found them all predictable yet somehow still fascinating. [233]

She extended what she'd been holding—a baseball, its leather worn but preserved, covered in signatures. [248] One name stood out, written in handwriting that seemed to shimmer: "Regards from 2087, J. Martinez." [265]

Marcus took it carefully. [269] "A time traveler signed this?" [275]

"He was from a future where people couldn't feel empathy anymore," she said. [288] "A plague swept through, killing that capacity in anyone over twenty. [300] He came back trying to understand it, to kindle empathy where none remained in his own time. [318] He failed. [320] Died here, actually, in these waters, trying to change something in his past that might alter everything in his future." [342]

Marcus turned the ball in his hands, feeling the stitches, the weight of failed hope. [357] "Why show me this?" [361]

"Because you think your journey ends with forgetting," the Interpreter said, standing now, gesturing to the cavern around them. [379] "But this place—it's a labyrinth of choices. [388] Every tunnel leads somewhere different. [393] Some circle back. [396] Some drop into nowhere. [400] You can't unknow that choices exist, even if you can't remember which ones you made." [416]

The bioluminescent waters pulsed gently, as if breathing. [424] Marcus stared at the baseball, at the impossible signature, at the evidence of someone who'd traveled through time itself and still couldn't outrun his own nature. [448]

"He wrote something else," the Interpreter continued, pointing to the ball's sweet spot where tiny writing curved around the brand name. [468] Marcus squinted: "Empathy isn't memory. [473] It's choice. [475] Choose." [476]

The word hit differently than any memory could have. [485] Marcus had spent weeks after the procedure searching newspapers for clues to his past, reading between lines, hoping to find some key that would unlock who to become. [511] But maybe that was the wrong journey. [518]

"What did I do?" [522] he asked quietly. [525]

"Does it matter?" [528] The Interpreter's voice softened slightly. [533] "You're here, in the dark, beside waters that make their own light. [546] You're holding proof that even the future can be uncertain, that people from times ahead of us still struggle with the same things. [570] Whatever you did, you chose to forget it. [578] Now choose what comes next." [583]

Marcus nodded slowly, understanding settling over him like the cool air of the cavern. [597] The labyrinth of choices hadn't begun with the procedure—it had simply become visible. [611] He set the baseball down gently on the dock and looked out at the glowing lake, at its delicate robust beauty, light thriving in absolute darkness. [635]

"I choose to try," he said. [641]

The Interpreter smiled, jaded but genuine. [647] "Then you've already changed everything," she said, and somewhere in the deep water, something luminous stirred. [664]

Marcus took his first step back through the tunnels, leaving his dirty past in the depths, carrying only the impossible baseball's lesson forward into the uncertain maze ahead. [692]
