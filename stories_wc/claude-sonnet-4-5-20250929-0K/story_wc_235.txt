The birch bark scroll sat on the rough-hewn table, edges curling like dried leaves, covered in Maren's frantic handwriting. [18] She'd begun keeping records three years ago, after the diagnosis made time fold in on itself like origami. [36] Chronic temporal displacement syndrome, the neurologist had called it, though Maren preferred to think of herself as chronologically confused—it sounded less clinical, more like a personality quirk than a curse. [68]

The mountain ranger cabin had become her refuge after that afternoon at Hillcrest Cemetery, where she'd stumbled upon a headstone bearing her name and a death date two years hence. [96] Most people would have called it coincidence, another Maren Castellane in a family tree. [111] But she'd recognized the quote etched beneath: "She made sense of the senseless." [124] Only her grandmother knew she'd wanted those words. [132] Only her grandmother had been dead for fifteen years. [141]

Now Maren worked as a lucid dream chronicler, documenting the subconscious narratives of clients who paid handsomely to understand their nocturnal minds. [161] She'd distill their chaos into narrative, transform their jumbled dreamscapes into coherent stories they could hold and examine in daylight. [180] The irony wasn't lost on her—she who could barely keep her own timeline straight, threading order through others' psyches. [200]

Tonight she reviewed her own dreams, transcribed onto the scroll in birch bark ink she'd learned to make from YouTube videos that wouldn't exist for another decade. [228] Or had existed. [231] Time was soup now, everything floating, nothing solid. [239]

The entries revealed a pattern she'd been avoiding: feral nostalgia. [249] Not the sweet ache of remembering better days, but something savage and consuming. [262] She wasn't missing her past self—she was jealous of her. [274] That Maren, the one from five years ago, who'd hiked these mountains every weekend, whose body obeyed her commands, whose memories arrived in proper order. [298] That Maren who'd kissed David under the aspens, not knowing she'd forget that kiss three times before finally writing it down, not knowing she'd relive their breakup in random sequence until she couldn't remember which betrayal came first. [334]

The scroll documented it all: dreams where she could soar above the pine forests, looking down at her younger self on the trail, screaming warnings that never reached. [360] Dreams where she attended her own funeral and argued with the mourners about the date. [376] Dreams where she lived backward through her accomplishments, watching her career unravel like thread from a sweater. [393]

She'd started chronicling lucid dreams professionally because she'd become so skilled at controlling them—when your waking life was chaos, sleep became the only place to impose order. [419] Her clients marveled at her insights, never knowing she experienced their temporal confusion as Tuesday. [435]

Maren added another entry to the scroll, her thirty-seventh birch bark page, ink made from bark and bittersweet berries. [454] She wrote about last night's dream: soaring over the canyon where she'd scattered her grandmother's ashes, seeing herself there as a child, as an adult, as she'd be at fifty if she made it that far. [490] All versions existing simultaneously, waving at each other across time's collapsed distances. [502]

The jaded wonder had settled into her bones like cold—not cynicism exactly, but an exhausted amazement at reality's persistence in surprising her. [524] She'd seen her grave and kept living. [532] She'd forgotten her mother's face and remembered it. [541] She'd written the same day three different ways and couldn't say which version was true. [556]

Outside, an owl called through the mountain darkness. [564] Maren rolled the scroll carefully, tied it with deer sinew, and placed it in the cedar box with the others. [584] Tomorrow she'd transcribe another client's dreams, make sense of their senseless, distill their chaos into narrative. [600] Tonight she'd sleep and soar and perhaps catch another glimpse of all her selves scattered through time, that pack of strangers wearing her face, living lives she'd already forgotten or hadn't lived yet. [633] She envied them and pitied them equally. [641] They didn't know yet what she knew: that memory was just another story, and stories could be rewritten until the ink ran dry. [665]

The birch bark scroll would outlast her confusion. [673] That's why she kept writing. [678]
