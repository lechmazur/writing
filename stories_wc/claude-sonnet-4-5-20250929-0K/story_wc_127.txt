The amber grotto glowed softer as dusk approached, its resinous walls catching the last rays of sunlight and holding them like cupped hands around flame. [27] Mara pressed her fingertips against the fossilized surface, feeling the static electricity dance across her skin—the method she'd perfected over seven years of professionally thorough work. [55] Through that electric whisper, she could sense the emotional residue trapped within: ancient joy, prehistoric fear, millennia-old contentment. [73] All genuine, all worthless to her trade. [80]

She dealt in counterfeits. [84]

The fragrance chemist's blotter petal lay in her palm, a delicate square of absorbent paper no larger than a thumbnail. [105] Its edges were stained with experimental scents—bergamot, synthetic musk, something floral that had no natural counterpart. [123] But Mara had repurposed it, soaking it instead in her latest creation: a cocktail of half-truths that would read as authentic love to anyone who couldn't sense the difference. [152]

Her client waited outside the grotto, a woman named Therese who'd commissioned joy for her dying mother. [169] "She needs to believe I've forgiven her," Therese had explained, her own emotions a tangle Mara had observed with affectionate detachment. [189] "I can't feel it yet, but I want her to die thinking I do." [204]

It was the kind of request that had driven Mara to this work—the gap between what people felt and what they needed to feel. [227] Or what they needed others to believe they felt. [237] She'd learned long ago that authentic emotions were overrated, often messy and inconvenient. [250] Her counterfeits served a purpose: they let people live with their contradictions, speak their necessary lies, maintain the social facades that kept the world turning. [274]

But lately, something had shifted. [279]

Mara touched the grotto wall again, letting static electricity flow through her nerves like a second nervous system. [297] This time, she sensed deeper—past the ancient emotions, into the structure of the amber itself. [313] The resin had subsume countless insects, plant matter, even drops of prehistoric rain. [327] It had taken all of it into itself and transformed, creating something neither living nor dead, neither past nor present. [348]

As the transformation completes, she thought, reading the electrical signature of the amber's final molecular shifts. [365] The resin had needed millions of years; her counterfeits took only hours. [378] But perhaps both processes shared something essential: the desire to fuse insight with empathy, to bridge the impossible distance between separate beings. [400]

She lifted the blotter petal to her nose. [408] The half-truths she'd engineered smelled like forgiveness—or what most people thought forgiveness should smell like. [425] Sweet but not cloying, warm but not overwhelming, with an undertone of something earned. [440] It was professionally thorough work, her best yet. [449]

But it was still a lie. [455]

Mara stood in the amber light, feeling the static electricity fade from her fingertips. [469] Outside, Therese waited with her incomplete emotions, her mother waited with her fading consciousness, and between them yawned a gap that Mara's counterfeit could span. [493] The false feeling would work. [498] The dying woman would believe herself forgiven. [505] Therese would believe she'd given her mother peace. [514] Everyone would get what they thought they needed. [522]

And yet. [524]

The amber around her had taken the truth of ancient life and transformed it into something beautiful through pressure and time. [546] Perhaps that was the real alchemy—not creating false emotions, but allowing real ones to transform, however long it took. [566]

She looked at the blotter petal again, this counterfeit miracle. [576] Then, with professionally thorough precision, she began to remake it. [587] Not a forgiveness that Therese didn't feel, but something more honest: an acknowledgment of the wish to forgive, the hope that someday she might. [612] A half-truth, yes, but one that pointed toward a whole one. [625]

It was a small change, barely detectable. [632]

But as Mara walked toward the grotto's entrance, watching dusk deepen into night, she felt the static electricity still humming in her bones. [653] Perhaps sensing through such currents had finally taught her something: that the space between authenticity and artifice, like the space between insect and amber, was where transformation actually lived. [682]

She handed Therese the blotter petal with affectionate detachment, already knowing what would come next. [698]
