The hourglass had been empty for three crossings now, and Mateo polished its brass frame anyway, humming as the ferry cut through water that reflected stars at impossible angles. [30] As deckhand on the Meridian Run, he'd grown used to passengers who flickered at the edges of his vision, appearing solid one moment and translucent the next—especially during the hours when clocks ran sideways, their hands circling vertically instead of horizontally. [67] Tonight felt different, though. [71] The ferry was vanishing. [75]

It started with the stern rail, which had begun phasing in and out of existence like a half-remembered dream. [94] Mateo radioed the captain immediately, keeping his voice steady despite the creeping wrongness. [107] "Captain Torres, we've got a situation. [113] The boat's losing cohesion at the aft section." [121]

Static crackled back, then Torres' gravelly voice: "I see it, Mateo. [132] We're caught in a pattern collision. [138] Two timelines are bleeding together where they shouldn't." [146]

Mateo understood immediately. [149] The ferry existed as a permanent fixture in both timelines—a vessel eternally crossing between the mainland and the island, perpetually transient, belonging fully to neither shore. [173] That paradox had always been its strength, allowing it to navigate the spectral grotto beneath the harbor where reality grew thin and starlight pooled in underground chambers. [199] But something had shifted in the interconnected patterns that held the parallel worlds apart. [213]

"The hourglass," Mateo said, gripping the empty timepiece that hung in the wheelhouse. [226] "When did it run out?" [232]

"Three crossings ago," Torres confirmed. [237] "Same time the phasing started." [242]

The hourglass had been a gift from the previous deckhand, a woman who'd sailed these routes for forty years before retiring to the island. [267] She'd told Mateo it measured something other than minutes—the tension between what was and what might be, she'd said, smiling cryptically. [289] As long as sand flowed through it, the ferry would maintain its delicate balance between timelines. [305]

Now passengers were beginning to notice the vanishing rails, the deck planks that winked out of existence. [321] Mateo moved among them with resiliently positive energy, reassuring a worried mother, helping an elderly man to a more stable section near the bow. [343] "Just a bit of temporal turbulence," he explained with a confident grin. [355] "Nothing the Meridian hasn't handled before." [361]

But privately, he radioed Torres again. [367] "We need to merge the timelines, Captain. [374] It's the only way to stabilize the ferry." [383]

"That's never been done," Torres said. [389] "The patterns are too complex, too interwoven." [397]

"Then we follow them," Mateo replied, studying the way the starlight moved through the grotto's crystalline walls as they passed beneath the harbor. [420] The spectral cavern always revealed truths that surface reality concealed. [430] He could see it now—the patterns weren't random. [439] They spiraled and interconnected like threads in a vast loom, each timeline a separate color woven through the same cosmic fabric. [460]

Mateo grabbed the empty hourglass and held it up to the starlight streaming through the grotto's ceiling. [477] The glass itself began to glow, revealing invisible etchings—a map of the pattern intersections. [492] "Captain, turn us toward the center confluence point. [501] The hourglass is showing the way." [508]

Torres didn't hesitate. [511] The ferry swung hard to port, angling toward a whirlpool of stellar light where the grotto's ceiling opened to impossible skies. [530] As they entered the confluence, Mateo felt the timelines pressing against each other, seeking resolution. [545] He held the hourglass steady, letting it act as a focus point. [558]

The ferry shuddered, solidified, then seemed to exist in multiple states simultaneously. [570] Through the empty hourglass, Mateo watched the timelines spiral together, merging via the interconnected patterns that had always linked them. [589] The sand began to flow again—not falling downward, but sideways, matching the clocks. [604]

When they emerged from the grotto into normal harbor waters, the ferry was whole again, more real than before. [623] Passengers disembarked without remembering the strangeness, but Mateo knew the truth. [635] The Meridian Run now sailed a merged timeline, permanently transient no longer. [648]

He set the hourglass back in its mount, watching the sand trace its sideways path. [664]

Torres clapped his shoulder. [668] "Well done, deckhand. [671] Though I suspect we'll see stranger crossings still." [680]

Mateo grinned, already preparing for the next departure. [689] "I'm counting on it, Captain." [695]
