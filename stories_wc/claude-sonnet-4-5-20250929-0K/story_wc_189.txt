The jade cicada lay between them on the weathered stone, its carved wings catching starlight that filtered through the grotto's opening. [21]

Mira had stopped speaking mid-sentence, her accusation hanging in the salt-thick air like the cry of a gull. [39] Chen looked away from her hurt expression to the tidal pools arrayed around them, each one a world he'd spent decades documenting—the patient chronicler of small lives in their endless cycles. [68]

"You weren't even listening," Mira said finally, her voice smaller now. [79]

He had been, though not in the way she meant. [89] Chen's warmly observant nature had taught him that truth rarely arrived through direct confrontation. [103] When his daughter spoke of feeling abandoned by his work, he heard instead the particular quality of her silence between words, the way her fingers twisted the hem of her jacket—small tells that revealed what her anger obscured. [141]

"I brought something to show you," he said, retrieving the jade cicada from where he'd placed it earlier, knowing this conversation would come. [164]

Mira's jaw tightened. [167] "This is exactly what I'm talking about. [174] I'm trying to tell you how I feel, and you're distracting me with some artifact—" [191]

"It was your mother's," Chen interrupted gently. [198]

The pause that followed felt different, deeper. [205] Above them, the ancient grotto's ceiling sparkled with mineral deposits that resembled constellations, accumulated over millennia. [220] Chen had chosen this place deliberately, this threshold between land and sea where everything existed in transition. [237]

"Mom never mentioned it," Mira said, but her hand reached out, hovering. [249]

"She bought it the day we learned she was sick." [259] Chen turned the cicada slowly, letting the starlight illuminate its intricate carving. [272] "Cicadas spend years underground before emerging. [279] She said it reminded her that transformation takes time, that some things can't be rushed." [295]

Mira took the cicada, her thumb tracing the delicate jade wings. [306] In the tidal pools around them, Chen could foresee the coming tide as clearly as he foresaw this moment's resolution—not through any mystical gift, but through decades of attention to subtle signs. [339] The water level in the western pool had risen a centimeter. [351] A hermit crab was retreating toward higher ground. [360] His daughter's breathing had shifted from rapid to measured. [369]

"I don't understand what this has to do with anything," Mira said, but her voice had softened. [386]

"You asked me once why I chose to chronicle tidal pools." [398] Chen knelt beside the nearest one, and after a moment, Mira joined him. [412] "Everyone wants to study the dramatic things—sharks, whales, coral reefs. [423] But I wanted to discover the texture of time itself, to understand how life persists through constant change." [441] He pointed to a sea anemone, its tentacles waving. [451] "Twice daily, this creature's entire world drains away. [460] It survives the transition. [464] It has to." [467]

"You think I'm like a sea anemone?" [475] Mira asked, and Chen heard the first hint of humor returning to her voice. [490]

"I think we're all in tidal pools," he said. [500] "Your mother's death. [504] You leaving for university next month. [511] These aren't endings—they're transition periods. [517] The water always returns, but it brings something different each time." [528]

Mira was quiet, holding the jade cicada against her palm. [538] Around them, the grotto breathed with the ocean's rhythm, this ancient place that had witnessed countless transformations. [554]

"I needed you more directly," she said finally. [562] "After Mom died. [565] I needed you to just... [571] be there." [573]

"I know." [575] Chen felt the weight of that truth settle between them like the jade cicada had earlier. [592] "I approached everything tangentially because facing it straight on would have broken me. [605] That wasn't fair to you." [610]

The tide was coming in now, filling the pools with fresh water, bringing new organisms, washing some things away. [628] Mira leaned against her father's shoulder, still holding her mother's cicada. [639]

"Will you tell me about her?" [645] she asked. [647] "Not the big things. [651] The small ones. [654] The things you observed." [658]

Above them, stars wheeled slowly in their ancient patterns, and Chen began to speak, his words like careful notations in a chronicle that would never end, only transform. [686]

The pause in their difficult conversation had opened something neither had anticipated—not resolution exactly, but the recognition that some transitions require patience, observation, and the willingness to wait for the returning tide. [720]
