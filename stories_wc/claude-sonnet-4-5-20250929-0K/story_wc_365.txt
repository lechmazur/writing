The abandoned spaceport repair bay smelled of rust and ozone, a cathedral of metal ribs stretching into darkness overhead. [19] Kael pressed her fingertips against the cold bulkhead, closing her eyes as the sensory map unfolded in her mind—temperature gradients blooming like flowers, vibrations singing their history of machinery long silenced, the particular taste of air molecules that had cycled through the same space for decades. [60] This was her gift and her curse: she made maps not of what could be seen, but of what could be felt, tasted, heard, breathed. [86]

The green glass shard lay on the workbench where she'd left it, catching the dim emergency lighting that still pulsed with stubborn regularity. [108] She'd found it three cycles ago, wedged between dimensional folds she shouldn't have been able to perceive—but the maps didn't lie. [130] When she touched it, the world stuttered. [137]

Kael had learned the pattern now, cyclically spontaneous as heartbeats that skip without warning. [150] Every seventeen minutes, the shard would hum, and reality would become permeable. [162] Not predictable in its specifics, but reliable in its rhythm. [172] Through it, she could glimpse the murmur of half-remembered dreams: parallel universes layering over this one like translucent pages in an infinite book. [195]

She picked up the shard now, feeling its edges bite her palm. [207] In the adjacent reality, this repair bay wasn't abandoned—she could sense the heat of active plasma torches, hear voices she almost recognized. [229] In another layer, the bay had never been built at all, just empty asteroid and starlight. [245] But in one particular fold, in one specific universe that called to her like a familiar song, someone had left her a message. [268]

Her sister. [270]

Mira had disappeared seven years ago, walking into the eastern airlock and never emerging on the other side. [287] The official report said equipment malfunction, decompression, tragedy. [295] But Kael's maps had always shown something else—a wrongness in the space where her sister had vanished, a deliberate redirection of something fundamental. [318]

The shard began to hum. [323]

Kael closed her eyes and let her awareness expand, weaving between worlds with the practiced ease of someone who'd spent months learning to navigate the impossible. [347] She tasted copper in one universe, honey in another, ash in a third. [360] Temperature dropped seventeen degrees to her left, rose thirty-two to her right. [373] The sound of breathing—not her own—echoed from a reality where the bay held life. [388]

There. [389]

A figure standing by the eastern airlock, sensory signature achingly familiar despite seven years and infinite distance. [405] Kael pushed harder, forcing her consciousness to bridge the gap, to reach through the parallel layers. [421]

"Why?" she whispered into the space between universes. [429]

The figure turned, and Kael felt rather than saw her sister's face. [441] Mira's presence carried the weight of a withheld truth, heavy as collapsed stars. [454]

"I had to redirect the convergence," Mira's voice came through layered with static and impossible distances. [469] "This universe, our universe—it was the anchor point. [479] If I'd stayed, the cascade would have collapsed everything into a single timeline. [492] Everyone we knew, everyone we loved, compressed into one inevitable outcome." [503]

Kael's hand tightened on the shard. [509] "You chose to scatter yourself across parallel universes instead?" [518]

"I chose to save you." [523] Mira's form flickered, cycling through different positions, different possibilities. [533] "The shard is a key, Kael. [540] It shows you the paths. [545] But you have to decide—do you want me back in one universe, or do you want to preserve the infinite variations where things turned out differently?" [571]

The hum reached its crescendo and began to fade. [580]

Kael opened her eyes, staring at the green glass in her hand. [592] She finally understood the weight her sister had carried alone. [603] Some truths, once discovered, demanded impossible choices. [610]

She placed the shard back on the workbench carefully. [619]

Tomorrow, when it hummed again, she would make her decision. [629]

But tonight, in this abandoned repair bay, in this particular universe among infinite others, Kael sat with the weight of love measured against existence itself. [653]

Her sensory map expanded one final time, cataloging every detail, every possibility. [665]

The space between worlds tasted like goodbye. [672]
