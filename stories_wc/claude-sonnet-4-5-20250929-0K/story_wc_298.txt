The Moth Oracle walked barefoot through the catacomb orchard, where apple trees grew from the ribcages of saints and their roots coiled lovingly around femurs and skulls. [28] She carried the burned tarot card in her pocket, its edges still warm against her thigh. [46] The Lovers, half-consumed by flame, depicting two figures whose faces had melted into a single crying eye. [64]

She was searching for Marcus again. [70]

He'd been coming to her for three months now, this reckless idealist who believed he could trade away his depression like currency, who thought destiny was something that could be bartered at market price. [106] The Moth Oracle had warned him that such exchanges always bore hidden costs, but Marcus had smiled that fevered smile and said, "I'll pay anything to feel whole." [134]

The problem was, she'd let him. [141]

Within the glow of half-lit corridors, she found him kneeling beneath a pear tree whose branches grew through the eye sockets of a stone martyr. [167] Marcus was inlaying meaning everywhere, as he always did—pressing dried flowers into the carved names of the dead, arranging pebbles into constellations, whispering prayers into cracks. [194] He believed if he could just encode enough beauty into the world, it would encode beauty back into him. [214]

"You're using the orchard wrong," the Moth Oracle said, her voice fiercely gentle. [228] "This isn't a place for bargaining. [235] It's a place for accepting." [241]

Marcus looked up, and she saw the hollows beneath his eyes had deepened. [255] The destiny she'd helped him barter away—his melancholy, his wounded sensitivity—had left gaps. [270] He'd wanted to be happy, so she'd taught him the old ways, the dangerous ways: find someone carrying a joy they didn't want, someone exhausted by their own lightness, and make the trade. [305]

But joy isn't meant to be worn by someone whose skeleton wasn't built for it. [321]

"I can't sleep," Marcus whispered. [327] "The happiness sits wrong in my chest. [336] It feels like I swallowed wasps." [343]

The Moth Oracle knelt beside him, her fingers brushing the bone-white roots. [356] She'd been doing this work for seven years, since her own mother had taught her how to trammel souls, to bind and unbind the threads of fate. [384] She'd promised herself she'd only help people patch holes in the soul, never tear new ones. [402] But Marcus had been so desperate, and she had been so certain she could help. [419]

"I need to show you something," she said, drawing out the burned card. [433] "Do you remember the woman you traded with? [442] Rebecca?" [444]

Marcus nodded slowly. [447]

"She came to me last week," the Moth Oracle continued. [458] "Wanted her melancholy back. [463] Said your sadness felt like wearing someone else's grief, too specific, too foreign. [478] It was killing her in ways her own sadness never had." [490]

She watched understanding dawn across his face like a bruise. [501]

"I burned this card in the ritual to reverse the exchange," she said. [515] "But it didn't work completely. [521] You can't just swap destinies back and forth like clothes. [532] They change shape in the wearing." [539]

Marcus stared at the ruined card, at the merged faces of the lovers. [553] "So what do I do?" [560]

The Moth Oracle stood, offering her hand with that fierce gentleness that was both invitation and warning. [578] "You do the harder thing," she said. [586] "You learn to hold both the light and the dark. [598] You stop trying to cut away pieces of yourself and start accepting the whole architecture of your soul." [618]

Around them, the trees whispered, their roots tightening infinitesimally around ancient bones. [631] The orchard understood what humans always forgot: nothing grows without death threaded through it, no fruit ripens without rot waiting in its future. [654]

Marcus took her hand and stood, unsteady but standing. [664]

"Will it hurt?" [668] he asked. [670]

"Yes," she answered, with her dusky resolve hardening into something like hope. [684] "But you'll be real again. [690] And real, whole pain is better than borrowed joy any day." [702]

They walked together through the half-lit corridors, leaving the burned card on the martyr's stone palm—an offering, an apology, a beginning. [724]
