The asteroid's baroque corridors twisted like frozen music, their gilt edges catching the amber light that now marked time's passage—visible threads drifting through space like golden pollen since the Temporal Unveiling. [32] Kasimir traced one strand with his finger, watching it curl away from his touch, and felt the familiar weight of obsolescence settle deeper into his bones. [61] Once, he had led thousands against the Hegemony; now, he catalogued their ruins alone. [76]

He entered the disputed chamber where the crystal vase shard lay embedded in the wall, its facets refracting time-light into prismatic ghosts. [99] Dr. Vhen claimed it proved the asteroid's builders were merchants, pointing to decorative excess as evidence of wealth-obsessed culture. [119] Kasimir knew better—revolution taught you to read symbols the powerful tried to hide. [132]

The shard wasn't decoration. [136] It was remembrance. [139]

His fingers hovered over its surface, not quite touching. [148] The baroque architecture surrounding it—those excessive spirals, those seemingly purposeless flourishes—they weren't showing off prosperity. [165] They were poetry rendered in stone and metal, each curve a verse in a language academics like Vhen refused to learn because it couldn't be quantified. [191]

Kasimir withdrew his journal, its pages filled with verse fragments salvaged from his revolutionary days when words were weapons and metaphors could mobilize the masses. [216] He'd covered mirrors during the worst storms then—an old superstition his grandmother taught him, believing reflections during chaos invited catastrophe. [237] Now he understood it differently: sometimes you had to obscure one kind of seeing to achieve another. [254]

He began to devise his counter-argument, not through Vhen's clinical methodology but through reconstruction of meaning. [270] The vase hadn't been whole when placed here—excavation scans confirmed it was already shattered. [285] Someone had mortared a broken fragment into this central wall deliberately, surrounding it with elaborate architectural flourishes that echoed its fractured edges. [307]

They were memorializing loss. [311]

Kasimir's pen moved across paper, composing his interpretation: "A civilization that writes grief into its walls, that transforms destruction into sacred geometry, cannot be reduced to merchant ledgers and trade routes." [341] His words carried the burnished sorrow of recognition—he'd tried reimagining civilization once, believing revolution could reshape humanity's course. [360] Failed. [361] Failed so completely that his name was now an embarrassment, a cautionary tale about idealism colliding with reality. [379]

But these ancient builders had understood something he was only now learning: reimagining civilization didn't mean destroying the old and forcing in the new. [403] It meant honoring what broke, integrating loss into beauty, making brokenness itself architectural. [417]

Time-light drifted past the shard, each golden thread a visible moment. [428] Since the Unveiling, humanity could watch time move, could see the present becoming past. [443] It made everyone philosophical—how could you ignore existence when its passage glowed before your eyes? [460]

Kasimir wrote faster, his revolutionary fervor finding new purpose. [469] "They didn't cover their mirrors during storms—they made mirrors from their storms. [482] Every shattered thing became testimony. [487] This baroque excess isn't wealth display but emotional archaeology, each spiral preserving some small grief, some remembered joy, building civilization from the fragments of what came before." [515]

He photographed the shard from sixteen angles, documenting how the baroque flourishes around it weren't random but responsive, flowing toward the crystal like frozen water finding its level. [542] Vhen would present economic models and trade route analysis. [551] Kasimir would present this: evidence of a people who understood that culture wasn't built from prosperity but from what you did with brokenness. [573]

His defunct revolution had tried to smash everything, believing clean slates were possible. [587] These asteroid builders had been wiser—they'd made cathedrals from shards, transformed loss into legacy. [603]

As Kasimir left the chamber, time-light swirled around him, each visible thread a reminder that moments, like vases, were fragile things. [625] But perhaps that fragility was the point. [632] Perhaps civilization was always baroque—excessive, ornate, seemingly too much—because it took enormous effort to make broken things beautiful again. [654]

He clutched his journal, its pages now filled with a new kind of revolution: the patient work of reimagining what others had dismissed, finding poetry in archaeological fragments, honoring those who'd built meaning from ruins. [688]

The asteroid's corridors gleamed with burnished sorrow and stubborn hope, its baroque spirals finally making sense. [704]
