The queen had stopped believing in prophecy the day her advisors failed to predict the plague. [16] Now she climbed alone, her breath misting in the thin air, driven only by the dreams that clawed at her sleep. [35] Every night for a month, she had seen the ember grotto on the ridge, felt starlight bleeding through her fingers like wounds that wouldn't close. [59]

"Your Majesty, this is the final warning," the court oracle had whispered three days ago, her voice lacy with menace. [79] "Beyond the cobalt grotto, something waits that cannot be unwitnessed." [90]

The queen had smiled then, coldly. [96] Warnings were for those who still feared consequences. [104]

The ridge loomed ahead, its cobalt stone drinking the twilight. [115] She had left her crown, her guard, her kingdom of whispers and half-truths far below the cloudline. [132] Here, above the world, the air tasted of copper and coming thunder. [145] The grotto's entrance gaped like a mouth mid-scream, edges lined with stone that seemed to pulse with its own dim luminescence. [167]

Inside, the walls wept light. [172]

Not reflected light or crystalline refraction, but actual bleeding starlight that dripped down the cobalt surfaces in rivulets of silver-white. [192] The queen reached out, softly commanding her own trembling fingers to steady. [205] Where the starlight touched her skin, it burned cold, leaving trails of sensation that felt like memory made tangible. [224]

"I know you," she whispered to the grotto. [232]

The dreams had shown her this place, but they had also shown her more: a figure made of ember and shadow, a choice that would unmake kingdoms. [258] She moved deeper into the cave, following the phosphorescent trails to where the stone floor dropped away into darkness. [278]

And there, in that darkness, something breathed. [285]

Not human breath, but the slow exhalation of geological time, of mountains dreaming. [299] The queen felt an answering breath leave her own lungs, involuntary and synchronized. [312] In that shared exhale, she spotted them: fireflies, the first of summer, impossible at this altitude, impossible in this season. [332] They rose from the abyss like reversed stars, their gentle light casting dancing shadows that resolved into shapes. [350]

Images. [351]

Memories. [352]

Her father's face the day he told her she would be queen, not her brother. [368] The moment she had poisoned her first enemy, justified it as statecraft. [381] The morning she woke to find her heart had calcified into something that could watch cities burn without flinching. [401]

"You are the mystery," said a voice that was the grotto, the fireflies, the bleeding starlight all at once. [421] "You dreamed yourself here because you have forgotten what it means to feel." [435]

The queen wanted to argue, to command, to impose her will as she had learned to do. [452] But the words dried on her tongue. [459]

The fireflies circled closer, and in their light she saw her own reflection in a pool of starlight. [478] The face looking back was hers but younger, softer, still capable of wonder. [492] Still capable of fear. [496]

"What do you want from me?" she asked, her voice losing its regal edge. [510]

"Nothing," the grotto replied, its tone carrying that same lacy menace the oracle had wielded. [525] "I am only what you summoned. [531] The ember grotto on the ridge exists because you needed to climb beyond your kingdom, beyond your choices, to remember what you have become." [555]

The bleeding starlight intensified, and the queen understood. [564] The mystery of the recurring dreams was not about prophecy or warning. [577] It was about witness. [581] She had climbed here not to find answers but to see herself reflected in something older and more honest than courtly mirrors. [603]

The fireflies began to descend back into the darkness, taking their impossible summer light with them. [619] The queen stood in the cobalt grotto above the clouds, disenchanted with everything she had been, terrified of everything she might still become. [641]

She took one breath. [645]

Then another. [647]

And began the long climb back down to her kingdom, carrying the bleeding starlight inside her like a wound that might, finally, teach her how to heal. [673]
