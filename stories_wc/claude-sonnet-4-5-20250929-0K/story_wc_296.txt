The druid Maren moved through the swirling orchard vortex with warlike serenity, her staff cutting precise arcs through air thick with cursed mist. [25] The apple trees grew in impossible spirals here at the heart of the lake, their roots drinking black water, their branches forming a perpetual cyclone of white blossoms and rotting fruit. [54] She had come because she was known to find lost things, and something precious had vanished into this nightmare three days ago. [76]

The magician's apprentice had attempted a mirror-walking trick during the harvest festival, seeking to discover what mirrors don't show—the hidden truth behind reflections. [100] The spell had failed catastrophically, tearing open a rift that dragged him into the lake's cursed heart. [118] His master had hired Maren not because she was friendly—her guarded nature was legendary—but because lost things called to her like moths to flame. [143]

She began her search through expanding circles, the old method her grandmother had taught her. [158] Start at the center, move outward in widening rings, miss nothing. [170] The vortex resisted, wind screaming through skeletal branches, but Maren's resolve was iron forged in stillness. [186] She had survived the War of Thirteen Winters not through rage but through calm precision, and she carried that same focused peace now. [209]

In the third circle, she found the apprentice. [217] He hung suspended in mid-air between two mirror-bright pools of water, his body rigid, mouth open in a scream that made no sound. [241] A frozen confession, caught between speaking and silence. [249] His hands clutched something—a small leather pouch. [257]

Maren approached carefully, reading the curse's structure. [264] The apprentice had glimpsed what mirrors don't show: the reflection of his own soul, twisted and hungry. [281] The truth had paralyzed him, locked him in the moment of recognition. [293] To free him, she would need to unbend his rigid terror, let the scream complete itself. [309]

She planted her staff and began to sing, low notes that resonated against the vortex's shriek. [325] The trees shuddered, their spiral tightening. [331] As she sang, she noticed dark seeds scattered at the water's edge—flesh-eating plant seeds, the kind used in blood magic. [351] The apprentice hadn't just failed a trick; he'd been experimenting with forbidden growth, trying to cultivate something that fed on reflection itself. [373]

The realization shifted her approach. [378] She stopped trying to comfort and instead channeled the war-song, the melody that had once turned back armies through sheer unshakeable will. [399] The apprentice needed not gentleness but the strength to face what he'd done. [413] Her voice rose, each note a hammer striking the frozen moment, forcing it to crack. [429]

The apprentice's jaw began to move. [435] The scream finally emerged, raw and terrible, echoing across the cursed lake. [448] His body unlocked, tumbling toward the black water. [456] Maren caught him with a wind-working, lowering him gently to solid ground. [468]

He gasped, shaking, the leather pouch still clenched in his fist. [479] Inside were more flesh-eating plant seeds and a fragment of broken mirror. [491] "I wanted to grow something that could consume lies," he whispered. [503] "To eat away the false reflections people hide behind. [512] But it showed me—" [516]

"Your own false reflection," Maren finished, her voice hard but not unkind. [528] "The lies you tell yourself." [533]

She helped him stand, guiding him back through the expanding circles, retracing their path outward from the vortex's heart. [551] The orchard's spiral began to slow, the curse satisfied now that its prisoner had been claimed and released. [570] Behind them, the flesh-eating seeds sank into black water, never to sprout. [583]

As they reached the shore, the apprentice looked back at the swirling trees. [596] "What did you see in there?" [602]

Maren's guarded expression never wavered. [607] "I saw what I always see when I find lost things," she said. [620] "The truth that people are not lost—they simply refuse to unbend from the shape their fears have locked them into." [641]

She left him at the shore, moving on toward the next search, carrying her warlike serenity like a blade sheathed in stillness. [663]
