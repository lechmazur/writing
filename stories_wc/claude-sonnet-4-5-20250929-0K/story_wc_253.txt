The farmhouse sat in the permanent shadow of the turbines, their blades carving slow circles overhead. [16] Marcus arranged the dried flower bouquet on the kitchen table, the brittle stems clicking against the wood. [33] The petals had lost their color months ago, becoming the same pale gray as everything else since the Happiness Mandate fell. [53]

"I am now lifting the kettle," he announced to the empty room, his voice flat and theatrical. [69] "Observe how the water inside sloshes with profound significance as I carry it to the stove." [86] This was how he survived the quiet now—narrating every mundane movement as though performing for an invisible audience. [104]

His daughter Emma sat at the table, her face perfectly blank, trained into that expressionless mask the performers wore at the mandatory celebrations. [126] She'd been a street artist before, full of unauthorized emotions that got her flagged by the Wellness Monitors. [145] Now she performed compliance, and Marcus couldn't tell what remained underneath. [156]

He picked up a piece of driftwood and his knife, beginning to whittle. [169] "The blade peels away the surface," he intoned, "revealing what was always hidden beneath the rough exterior." [186] Wood curls fell onto his lap like tiny prayers. [196]

"Dad, you don't have to do that." [203] Emma's voice carried no inflection, no warmth or coldness—just sound. [215]

"I am acknowledging my daughter's statement," Marcus continued in the same dramatic monotone. [228] "I am considering her words while the turbines outside generate seventeen point three megawatts of renewable indifference." [246]

The Happiness Mandate had ended three months ago when the administration collapsed, but its ghost lingered. [262] People had forgotten how to feel without permission, without fear. [273] The remade hush that followed the years of forced joy was somehow worse than the mandate itself. [291] At least before, they'd had something to resist. [300]

Marcus set down the knife and crossed to his daughter. [311] "I am reaching for my daughter's hand," he narrated. [321] "I am wondering if she remembers when we used to talk without this performance, when grief was allowed its natural weight." [342]

Emma's mask cracked, just slightly. [347] "I remember." [350]

He'd started the narration during the mandate as a form of resistance, a way to acknowledge reality while technically complying. [371] Describing simple actions in absurd detail had been his small rebellion, morally ambiguous at best. [386] Was it cowardice dressed as cleverness? [392] Was it survival? [395] He'd watched neighbors taken away for unauthorized sadness while he spoke his truth through theatrical pretense. [411]

"The dried flowers," Emma said, her voice gaining texture, "were from Mom's funeral. [424] The one we couldn't mourn properly." [430]

"Yes." [431] Marcus felt something shift in his chest, a loosening. [441] "I kept them because—" [445]

"Because grief needs witnesses," Emma finished. [451] "Even when witnessing was illegal." [456]

The turbines rotated above them, generating power for a grid that no longer enforced emotional compliance. [473] Marcus lifted the flower bouquet, its weight insignificant, its meaning enormous. [485]

"I am holding the last physical evidence of my wife's death," he narrated, but his voice finally broke. [503] "I am realizing that cultivating lightness in grief doesn't mean erasing the grief itself." [518] Tears came, unauthorized but no longer illegal. [526] "It means learning to carry it without collapsing." [535]

Emma stood and took the bouquet from him, cradling it like something alive. [549] Her blank performer's face shifted, muscles remembering expressions they'd suppressed. [560] Sadness. [561] Relief. [562] Love. [563]

"I am watching my daughter feel again," Marcus whispered, abandoning the performance. [576] "I am understanding that the remade hush needed to be broken, even if we couldn't remember how." [594]

Outside, the turbines turned, and inside, two people began the long work of remembering how to be human without a script. [615] The dried flowers rested between them, gray and fragile and honest. [627] Marcus picked up his whittling knife again, but this time he carved in silence, letting the quiet be what it actually was—not void, not mandate, just space for whatever came next. [660]
