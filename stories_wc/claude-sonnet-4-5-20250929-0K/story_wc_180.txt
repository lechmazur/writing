The quartz-eye mender climbed through the broken window of the cathedral, her daughter's hair ribbon tied around her wrist like a talisman. [24] The blue silk had faded to grey over the years, but Marta kept it close, especially now that Lena refused to speak to her. [49] Inside, apple trees grew wild through the nave, their branches threading between ancient rafters where saints once gazed down in painted glory. [72]

"Deciduous vows," her own mother had called them—promises that fell away with the seasons, shed like autumn leaves when circumstances changed. [95] Marta had sworn to pass down the family craft to Lena, to teach her the delicate art of grinding quartz lenses for those whose eyes had clouded with age or injury. [128] But then the glassworks corporation had made their offer, and Marta had signed their contract, thinking she could modernize, thinking machines could do what hands had done for four generations. [160]

The breach had cost her everything—the corporation's automated grinders produced only flawed lenses, and the contract's penalty clause had taken her workshop, her tools, her reputation. [186] Lena had stopped coming by after that, disappointed in her mother's compromise. [198]

Now Marta pushed through the orchard's undergrowth, searching. [206] The letter had been cryptic: "Mother, if you want to understand, come to where prayers became fruit." [223] Only Lena would phrase it that way, endearingly feisty even in anger. [236]

A ladder leaned against one of the larger trees, disappearing into the canopy above. [250] Marta tested it, then began to climb, the old canvas bag on her shoulder bumping against her hip. [268] She'd grabbed it without thinking, the same satchel she'd carried for thirty years. [282]

At the top, wooden platforms connected the rafters, creating a network of walkways through the branches. [298] Lena sat cross-legged on one, surrounded by glass fragments and what looked like—Marta squinted—were those grinding stones? [317]

"You came," Lena said flatly. [322]

"You invited me." [325] Marta stepped onto the platform, apple blossoms drifting past them both. [338] "What is this place?" [342]

"Somewhere that adapts," Lena said, gesturing at the trees growing through consecrated architecture. [354] "The cathedral was abandoned, but nature persisted. [362] It didn't honor some rigid contract. [368] It just… found another way." [373]

Marta's chest tightened. [376] "I thought I was finding another way too. [385] The corporation promised efficiency, promised we could help more people—" [396]

"You promised me the old methods," Lena interrupted. [405] "The ones Grandmother used, and her mother before that." [415] She held up a clouded piece of quartz. [424] "I've been trying to remember, but there are gaps. [434] The way you wet the grinding stone, the angle you hold the lens blank…" [449]

Marta set down her bag, and something clinked inside. [458] Out of habit, she rummaged through it—old receipts, a cracked measuring cup, and there, wrapped in oilcloth, her grandmother's first grinding stone. [481] She'd thought it lost in the workshop seizure. [490]

"This was hers," Marta whispered, unwrapping it. [497] "She always said machines see with precision, but hands see with mercy." [510] She looked at her daughter. [516] "I forgot that. [519] I thought progress meant leaving things behind." [527]

Lena's expression softened slightly. [531] "Deciduous vows aren't about breaking promises, are they?" [540] she asked. [542] "They're about letting old forms fall away so new growth can happen." [555]

Marta touched the ribbon on her wrist. [563] "Your grandmother told me that after your father left. [573] I thought it meant some promises don't matter." [582] She moved beside Lena, taking the quartz from her hands. [593] "But really, it means the core persists while the expression changes." [605]

She wet the grinding stone with water from Lena's bottle, then began demonstrating the circular motion, the gentle pressure. [623] "See? [625] Not rigid, but responsive. [629] The quartz tells you what it needs." [637]

Lena's hands joined hers on the stone. [645] "Teach me again?" [648]

"Every day, if you'll have me." [655] Marta smiled. [657] "We'll start our own practice. [663] No contracts, just the work." [669]

Above them, apple blossoms fell through slanted light, landing on their joined hands as they ground the quartz together. [688] The cathedral's trees had taken decades to grow from seed to canopy, their roots cracking marble, their branches reconsecrating the space through pure persistence. [711]

Mother and daughter bent over their craft, bridging what had been broken, not by denying change but by remembering what mattered beneath it all. [733] Sometimes wisdom arrives accidentally, Marta thought, catching a blossom in her palm. [746] Sometimes you climb through a window and find that what you sought to teach, you first needed to relearn. [766]

The ribbon fluttered against her wrist as she worked. [776] A promise kept, finally, in a form neither of them had expected. [789]
