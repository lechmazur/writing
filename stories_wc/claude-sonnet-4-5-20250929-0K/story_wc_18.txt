The mirror maker's workshop stood at the edge of the ruined orchard district, where apple trees had calcified into silver-barked statues centuries ago. [25] Frost traced elaborate patterns across every surface, catching the twilight in prismatic fragments that made the world shimmer like splintered glass. [47] Aria pressed her palm against the cold workbench, firmly grounded in this single moment of clarity before the fog rolled back in. [70]

The astronomer's broken sextant lay before her, its arc fractured into three pieces. [83] Her brother had carried it the night he walked into the fog, chasing what he called "the dream of boundaries dissolving." [104] That had been seven years ago. [110] Last night, she'd found the sextant on her doorstep, covered in frost that wouldn't melt, and she'd understood: he was trying to come back. [133]

The fog beyond her windows moved with breath-like rhythm, thick as mountains of translucent glass. [148] Aria had learned its patterns the way others learned songs—the way it pressed close during twilight, how it retreated at noon to reveal glimpses of petrified fruit still clinging to dead branches. [178] The district had been abandoned when people realized the fog didn't just obscure vision; it erased the boundaries between dreaming and waking, between staying and leaving, between brother and mist. [207]

She arranged the sextant pieces in a careful triangle. [216] Through synchronized breathing, her grandmother had once told her, a mirror maker could recreate not just images but the moments reflected in broken things. [239] The technique required absolute presence—you couldn't chase the vision while also being firmly grounded in reality. [256] You had to become both anchor and sail. [264]

Aria closed her eyes and matched her breathing to the fog's pulse. [276] In, as it pressed against the windows. [284] Out, as it withdrew like a tide. [292] Her hands moved by memory, grinding glass powder, mixing it with silver oxide and the frost that wouldn't melt from the sextant's surface. [314]

The paste shimmered. [316] She began applying it to the sextant's breaks, and with each breath, she felt the boundaries of her workshop growing thin. [336] The fog seeped through the walls—not invading, but responding. [346] She breathed in. [349] The fog breathed in. [353] She exhaled, and through the synchronized rhythm, she began to see what the sextant had seen: her brother standing in the orchard, measuring the angle between stars that existed only in dreams. [383]

"I found where all boundaries end," his reflection whispered through the gathering mirror-paste. [396] "But I can't find my way back to where they begin." [408]

Aria's hands trembled, but she kept breathing with the fog, kept applying the silver mixture. [423] The sextant pieces began drawing together, not through force but through recognition—like memories finding their proper sequence. [441] In the forming mirror-surface, she saw the path her brother had walked, how he'd used the sextant to navigate between the possible and impossible until he'd become caught in the dissolving space between. [472]

"You can't capture a runaway dream," she said aloud, her voice echoing through the glass-mountain fog. [488] "But you can recreate the boundary it crossed." [497]

She pressed the final piece into place. [505] The sextant blazed with cold fire, and through it, she saw her brother's hand reaching back through years of fog, guided by the instrument she'd made whole. [531] The boundary between lost and found crystallized like frost forming on a window—delicate, clear, possible to cross if you knew the moment to move. [555]

At twilight's shimmer, when frost and fog became indistinguishable, she opened her workshop door. [569] Her brother stood there, older and translucent at the edges, but firmly present. [582] He held the restored sextant, its arc now a perfect semicircle of silver. [595]

"I mapped the spaces between things," he said. [604] "But I needed you to remember where I started." [614]

Aria took his hand, solid and cold as mirror-glass. [624] Behind them, the fog settled peacefully around the workshop, no longer erasing boundaries but illuminating them—frost-bright lines that showed exactly where one world ended and another could begin. [652]
