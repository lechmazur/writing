The cello rested against Marta's knee as she sat in the flooded orchestra pit, water lapping at the third rung of her chair. [24] Above, the grand chandelier hung dark and useless, but someone—perhaps the ghost herself—had arranged flickering lanterns along the balcony rails, casting trembling shadows across the velvet seats. [51] The opera house had been underwater for three days now, the river finally breaching the ancient foundation, and Marta had returned each night, lately inspired by something she couldn't name. [80]

In her lap lay the antique opera program, its pages warped and stained from the flood. [96] She'd found it floating near the conductor's podium yesterday, its ink bleeding into strange new patterns. [112] The water damage had transformed the printed text into something else entirely—swirls and symbols that seemed to pulse in the lantern light. [133] Marta traced her finger along what had once been the cast list for La Traviata, now a series of dots and curves that resembled musical notation. [158]

The ghost had left codes before. [164] Small disruptions in the natural order: music stands arranged in peculiar angles, bows repositioned to point toward specific seats, resin dust scattered in deliberate patterns on the stage. [190] But Marta had been the only one to notice, the only one who stayed in those in-between spaces when rehearsal ended and performance hadn't yet begun, when the opera house existed in its truest form—amid the hush of unstruck chords. [229]

She lifted her bow and drew it across the C string, letting the note hang in the damp air. [248] The sound traveled differently through water, deeper and more resonant, as if the flood had given the pit new acoustics. [268] In response, a lantern on the dress circle flickered twice. [279] Marta nodded—a wordless conversation they'd been having for months now, even before the flood. [294]

The water-damaged program showed a pattern: every third letter that remained legible, every stain that resembled a rest or fermata. [313] Marta had been piecing it together, this message from someone who'd drowned here seventy years ago, a violinist named Constance who'd fallen from the balcony during a performance. [339] The official story was accident, but the ghost's codes suggested otherwise. [351] Someone had pushed her. [355] Someone whose name was hidden in these symbols. [364]

Marta played another note, this time an E flat. [373] Two lanterns responded, and a small wave rippled across the pit, disturbing the stillness. [388] She consulted the program again, holding it up to catch the light. [401] The water damage had created images in the margins—faces, perhaps, or letters overlapping until they became something new. [419] She squinted at one particular stain that had bloomed across the soprano's name. [433] Beneath the spreading brown-gold damage, another name emerged: Moretti. [443] The conductor from 1953. [447]

The same conductor whose portrait hung in the lobby, whose conducting baton was displayed in a glass case, who'd been celebrated as the opera house's greatest maestro. [472]

Marta set down her cello and stood carefully in the chest-deep water, holding the program above her head. [491] She waded toward the stage, where more lanterns had been arranged in a circle. [506] As she approached, they all flickered in unison—yes, yes, yes. [518]

She climbed the stairs to the stage, water streaming from her clothes, and laid the program at center stage where Constance had taken her bow that final night. [545] The lanterns blazed brighter, their light no longer flickering but steady and strong. [559] In the water pooling around the program, the stains seemed to lift and swirl, reforming into words: TELL THEM. [579]

Marta pulled out her phone, protected in its waterproof case, and photographed the program, the lanterns, the water-written confession. [598] Tomorrow she would disrupt the official history, would speak for the ghost who'd been waiting seven decades in the in-between spaces. [619]

Tonight, though, she descended back to her chair in the flooded pit, lifted her bow, and played Constance's favorite piece—Pachelbel's Canon, each note a promise kept in the wordless language they shared. [649] The ghost answered with every lantern in the house, a full orchestra of light acknowledging what had finally been understood. [670]

When Marta finished, she whispered to the water-filled darkness: "I heard you." [683]

The lanterns dimmed peacefully, and for the first time since the flood began, the opera house felt complete. [701]
