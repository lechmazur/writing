The astronomical compass had been her grandfather's, its brass patina worn smooth from decades of ocean crossings, but Marina couldn't bring herself to use it anymore. [28] She sat at the coastal kayak launch, watching dawn paint the horizon in shades of rust and gold, the compass heavy in her lap like an accusation. [56] Three years since she'd guided anyone anywhere, three years since her miscalculation had sent the research vessel into the rocks, three years of watching expectations collapse like a sandcastle meeting tide. [89]

The utility poles along the shoreline stretched north in their metronomic rhythm, and she'd learned to navigate her morning walks by counting them—pole seventeen meant turn back, pole twenty-three meant you've gone too far again. [122] It was a ridiculous method for someone who'd once plotted courses by stars, but broken navigators gravitate toward whatever certainty they can find, even if it's just weathered wood and sagging wire. [155]

"You Marina Chen?" [159] The voice belonged to a young woman in a faded wetsuit, carrying a kayak paddle like a staff. [178] "I'm Amy. [181] I hired you for the island crossing." [188]

Marina's stomach twisted. [191] "I sent you an email. [196] I don't guide anymore." [200]

"I didn't get it." [204] Amy set down her paddle and squatted beside Marina, studying her with unsettling directness. [218] "Or maybe I did and deleted it. [226] Look, I know what happened with the Mariner's Quest. [236] Everyone knows." [238]

The backlash of regrets hit Marina like it always did—sudden, breathtaking—phantom guilt for the crew member who'd broken his back, for the research data lost, for the confidence she'd never recover. [270] She'd been certain of her calculations that night, merrily plotting their course while joking with the captain, melancholic already because it would be her last voyage before her grandfather died. [299] She hadn't known then how prophetic that melancholy was. [308]

"I can't help you," Marina whispered. [314]

Amy picked up the astronomical compass, turning it over in her hands. [326] "My sister drowned last year. [331] Kayaking alone, ignored every safety protocol I'd taught her." [341] Her voice carried that particular quality Marina recognized—flickering faith in a universe that made sense. [357] "I need to paddle to Morgan Island, scatter her ashes at the sea cave we found as kids. [375] But I'm terrified of going alone, and I'm terrified of taking someone with me because what if I'm like her?" [397]

Marina understood then. [400] Amy wasn't looking for a competent navigator. [407] She was looking for someone who understood that to align heart and action sometimes meant moving forward despite the cracks running through you. [429]

"The weather's turning this afternoon," Marina said slowly, surprising herself. [439] "We'd need to launch within the hour." [447]

They prepared in silence, Marina's hands remembering routines she thought she'd forgotten. [459] As they carried the kayaks to the water, Amy asked, "Will you use that?" [473] She nodded at the compass clipped to Marina's life vest. [484]

Marina looked down at it, then up at the utility poles marching along the coast, then out at the vast indifference of the Pacific. [508] "I'll use everything," she said. [514] "Stars, currents, poles, gut feeling. [520] That's what I should have done before—trusted more than one system." [531]

They launched into gentle swells, paddles catching rhythm. [539] The morning felt simultaneously heavy with grief and impossibly light, merrily melancholic in the way of all beginnings that acknowledge endings. [559] Marina checked the compass, noted the angle of wind on water, remembered the chart she'd studied last night after accepting that she would do this. [584]

"North-northwest," she called to Amy. [589] "Stay close, match my pace." [595]

Amy's kayak gravitated toward hers, and they moved together through the silver-bright water. [608] Marina didn't know if this would heal anything, didn't know if one successful crossing could outweigh catastrophic failure. [626] But the compass was warm against her chest, the shore was falling behind, and for the first time in three years, she was navigating not away from her mistakes but through them toward something that mattered. [663]

The utility poles grew smaller, then vanished. [670] There was only open water now, the island somewhere ahead, and two broken people choosing to trust each other with the journey. [692] Marina adjusted their course five degrees, felt the rightness of it in her bones, and kept paddling into whatever came next. [713]
