The moonlit ridge path twisted through charred stumps, remnants of last season's inferno. [13] Marcus walked it alone, his face a topography of burn scars that caught the silver light like mountain shadows. [31] In his calloused hands, he carried a cracked porcelain box his daughter had made in art class three years ago, before the accident. [52]

The celestial bodies moved overhead in their ancient choreography—Jupiter rising, Mars setting, the moon traversing its arc with patient inevitability. [73] Marcus had learned to measure time by such movements during his long nights in fire towers, watching for the first spark that could devour a forest. [98] Now he measured something else: the distance between who he'd been and who the flames had made him. [117]

He'd been gently skilled once, known throughout the department for talking down panicked homeowners while directing water onto their roofs with surgeon's precision. [139] Children hadn't feared his approach. [144] That was before the Riverside fire, before he'd found the girl—maybe eight years old—sheltering in a root cellar while her family's cabin dissolved into ash above her. [171]

She'd survived. [173] He'd carried her out, but not before a burning beam collapsed across his back and face. [190] The scars healed poorly, deliberately so; he'd refused the grafts, the cosmetic procedures. [203] Some marks needed to stay visible. [209]

The girl's parents had wanted to thank him, offer him money, their eternal gratitude. [223] He'd accepted none of it. [228] What haunted Marcus wasn't the pain—he'd made a bargain with that, translated it into something he could carry like stones in his pockets. [251] What haunted him was the girl's face: how she'd looked at him with such complete trust as the world burned, how she'd believed absolutely that he would save her. [279]

Bargained innocence, he thought. [282] She'd traded her unquestioning faith in safety for the knowledge that everything could burn. [297] He'd been the instrument of both her salvation and her enlightenment, the one who'd shown her that adults couldn't always keep their promises of protection. [320]

Marcus stopped where the path widened, overlooking a valley regenerating with new growth. [333] Moonlight silvered the young aspens, their white bark luminous. [343] He opened the cracked porcelain box—his own daughter's work, broken when she'd thrown it at him during their last argument. [363] "You're never here," she'd screamed. [368] "You love those forests more than us." [375]

She was right and wrong. [379] He'd returned to firefighting obsessively after the Riverside incident, unable to stop, needing to be the barrier between flames and innocence. [400] But it had cost him his marriage, his daily presence in his daughter's life. [415] Another bargain, another exchange of one precious thing for another. [426]

Inside the box: his daughter's baby teeth, a dried flower from his wedding, his firefighter's badge. [442] Small relics of identity, all cracked containers of who he'd been. [453]

He'd come here to reflect deeply, as his therapist suggested—to find meaning in the pattern of his choices. [472] The moon illuminated a truth he'd been avoiding: he couldn't translate everyone's pain into something bearable. [488] He couldn't be the universal language between suffering and sense. [498] But he could be present, scarred and imperfect, showing his daughter that love meant staying even when fear made you want to run toward the next fire. [524]

Marcus closed the box gently, its crack now seeming less like damage and more like the place where light got in. [545] Tomorrow, he'd give it back to his daughter, tell her he was taking leave from the department. [562] He'd explain that some fires needed fighting at home, in the quiet spaces between father and child. [580]

The celestial dance continued overhead, indifferent and eternal. [588] Marcus descended the ridge path, his scars catching moonlight, carrying his broken beautiful box, learning that hard softness was its own kind of strength: armor with a door built in, finally ready to open. [618]
