The sky had turned the color of old brass three days ago, and nobody could say why. [17]

Kael scaled the final frozen steps to the icebound spire, his breath forming crystals that tinkled against the ancient stone. [34] Up here, above the clouds, the wrongness of the sky pressed close enough to touch—swirling patterns that made his eyes water and his heart race with something between terror and exhilaration. [63] This was exactly where he needed to be. [71]

The chivalrous thief, as the street children called him, had stolen from the rich for years, but he'd never kept a coin. [91] Instead, he'd apprenticed himself to wonder, collecting mysteries the way others collected gold. [104] His leather satchel clinked with hand-carved chess pieces, each one hollow, each one containing a secret written on rice paper thin as wishes. [126]

The spire's guardian was waiting in the crystalline chamber at the summit. [138] She was ancient, wrapped in furs that sparkled with permanent frost, and she smiled at him with sacredly playful eyes that had seen centuries fold into moments. [163]

"You've come to amend what you broke," she said, not asking. [174]

Kael nodded, pulling out his pocket sundial. [181] The lid was missing—he'd lost it the last time he was here, five years ago, when he'd been younger and more foolish. [203] When he'd stolen something he shouldn't have: her trust. [213]

"I didn't understand then," he said, approaching her chess table with cautious abandon, the way one might pet a wolf. [232] "I thought the secrets I collected were mine to keep. [243] I thought knowing was the same as understanding." [251]

The guardian gestured to the board between them. [259] It was set for a game that had been paused for half a decade. [273] "And now?" [276]

"Now I know that secrets are meant to flow like water." [287] Kael began placing his chess pieces on the board beside hers, each one carefully positioned. [303] A knight that held the secret of how the baker's daughter learned to fly. [317] A bishop containing the true name of the wind that sang through the market district. [332] A rook with the location of the underground river where lost memories pooled. [346]

"I've been swapping them," he explained, his fingers trembling slightly—not from cold, but from the magnitude of what he was attempting. [366] "Every time someone tells me a secret, I give them one in return. [379] I've been amending my old ways, making the world more mysterious rather than less." [393]

The guardian picked up one of his pawns, cracked it open with a fingernail. [407] She read the paper inside, and her laugh was like ice breaking in spring. [422] "The truth about why cats stare at nothing," she read. [433] "Sacredly playful indeed." [437]

She reached into her furs and pulled out the missing sundial lid. [450] It gleamed despite the wrong-colored light filtering through the spire's frozen walls. [463] "You left this when you ran," she said. [472] "I kept it, knowing you'd return when you were ready to embrace what you feared." [488]

Kael took the lid with shaking hands. [496] It fit perfectly onto his sundial, completing something he hadn't realized was broken. [509] But it was more than that—engraved on the inside were coordinates, numbers that shifted and changed as he watched. [528]

"The unknown," the guardian said softly, "is not something to be conquered or collected. [542] It's something to be lived with, danced with, honored." [552] She swept her arm toward the brass-colored sky beyond the windows. [564] "The sky is wrong because the world is becoming more than it was. [578] You can help people understand that wonder isn't something to fear." [590]

Kael nodded, pocketing the sundial. [595] Its weight felt right now, complete. [602]

He gathered his chess pieces, each secret ready to be traded again, to flow through the city below like water through roots. [623] The guardian smiled as he turned to go. [632]

"Remember," she called after him, "the best thieves don't steal wonder—they give it away." [647]

Kael descended into the wrongness with open arms, ready at last to be an apprentice of all the beautiful, terrible mysteries still waiting to unfold. [673]
