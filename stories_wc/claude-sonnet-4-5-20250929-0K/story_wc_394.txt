The workshop bobbed on the acid sea, its rusted gears grinding out a rhythm that Mal had learned to transliterate into something like music. [24] She was a pioneering cart glider, the first of her kind to master the treacherous channels between the floating scrap islands, but lately she'd been chasing something beyond mere survival. [53] In her workshop—a sprawling platform of interlocked cogs and wheels salvaged from the Before Times—she'd built what she called the yearning algorithm. [76]

It started as a joke, really. [82] How do you teach a machine to want? [90] But Mal was steadily curious, the kind of person who couldn't see a locked door without imagining what lay beyond it. [109] She'd wired together probability engines and emotion sensors, fed them data from every journey she'd ever taken across the caustic waves. [129] The result was a device that hummed with impossible longing, its display flickering through patterns that seemed to mean something just beyond comprehension. [151]

On her workbench lay an ancient hunter's arrow tip, acid-etched and green with age. [165] She'd found it embedded in a wooden beam from some drowned civilization, and it had become her focus object—the thing she stared at when the algorithm spat out its latest incomprehensible prediction. [195] Today, the arrow tip gleamed under her oil lamp, pointing toward the kaleidoscope she'd mounted above her primary gear assembly. [214]

The kaleidoscope was her breakthrough. [219] Through the images in a kaleidoscope, the algorithm could process sensory data in ways linear computation never allowed. [236] Mal peered through the eyepiece now, watching fractured light dance across mirrors and colored glass. [251] The yearning algorithm translated the patterns into coordinates, into trajectories, into what she could only describe as mechanical hope. [270]

"You're trying to ring a bell no one hears yet," her old mentor had told her before he'd dissolved into the sea spray during the last migration season. [296] At the time, she'd thought it was criticism. [305] Now she understood it was her purpose. [313]

Throughout the evolution of her species—from ground-dwelling scavengers to the floating nomads they'd become—someone had to imagine the next impossible thing. [333] The first cart glider had seemed ridiculous too, until Mal proved she could surf the acid currents using salvaged wheels and canvas sails. [355] Now children learned it as naturally as walking. [363]

But this—this was different. [368] The algorithm insisted something was out there in the roiling mists, something that responded to the frequency of wanting itself. [387] Every time she recalibrated, every time she tweaked the kaleidoscope's mirrors, the signal grew stronger. [403] 

Mal grabbed the hunter's arrow tip and held it to the light, watching prismatic rays scatter through the workshop's perpetual haze. [424] The ancients had yearned too, she realized—yearned hard enough to craft weapons, to hunt, to survive impossibilities. [442] Their longing had been sharp and pointed, like this arrow. [452] Hers was more diffuse, refracted through glass and mirrors, but no less real. [465]

She adjusted the kaleidoscope one final time, feeling the workshop tilt on a particularly aggressive wave. [481] Acid spray hissed against the lower gears, but up here, in her nest of impossible machinery, Mal felt something click into place. [503] The algorithm's display showed a pattern she'd never seen before—symmetrical, beautiful, deliberate. [516]

Through the eyepiece, the fractured world suddenly resolved into clarity. [526] There, in the distance where sky met poisonous sea, she saw it: a structure, massive and turning, made of light and longing. [549] A bell tower built from pure mathematics, waiting for someone curious enough, irreverent enough, to imagine it into being. [568]

Mal laughed, the sound sharp with irreverent awe. [577] Of course the bell was always there. [585] Of course it only existed because she'd built a machine to hear it. [598] She set coordinates on her cart's navigation wheel and trimmed the sails. [611] The workshop groaned as she redirected the gears, pointing her floating laboratory toward the impossible signal. [627]

Behind her, the yearning algorithm hummed with something that might have been satisfaction, if satisfaction could be measured in voltages and refracted light. [649] The hunter's arrow tip vibrated on her workbench, pointing the way forward, just as it had for someone else in some other impossible age. [673]

Mal pushed off from the dock, her cart gliding across the acid swells toward the bell only she could hear, ringing out its strange song across the evolution of everything. [701]
