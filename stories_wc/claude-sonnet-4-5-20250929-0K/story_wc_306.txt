The campfire's last spark died just as Mara reached the lighthouse, its beam cutting through dawn's gray veil. [18] She climbed the spiral stairs with the hollow mirror shard tucked against her palm, its edges worn smooth from months of handling. [39] As a conscience for hire, she'd built her reputation on certainty—tell me your dilemma, pay my fee, receive your answer. [60] Black or white, right or wrong, no hesitation. [68] 

Until Vincent. [70]

He'd hired her three months ago about whether to report his brother's embezzlement. [83] She'd said yes immediately, as she always did with crime. [93] Vincent followed her advice. [97] His brother went to prison. [102] His nephew lost his father. [107] The family shattered. [110] Vincent sent her a check with a note: "You were right, but was I?" [125]

The question had wrapped around her like a cloak of doubt, suffocating her profitable certainty. [140] She'd stopped taking clients. [144] Started carrying the hollow mirror shard she'd found on the beach, peering through its transparent center as if it might reveal what she'd missed. [168]

The lighthouse keeper found her on the gallery deck, where wind chimes sang in the salt breeze. [185] "You're early," he said, not quite meeting her eyes—that sincerely insincere greeting of someone who knew exactly why she'd come. [206] "Most people wait until full sunrise." [212]

"I need to unhook something," Mara said, the words feeling raw. [223] "From my thinking. [226] My certainty." [228]

He nodded toward the chimes—twelve different sets suspended from the railing, each producing distinct harmonies. [243] "My father installed these. [247] Taught me deciphering wind chime selections was how he made every important choice." [260] He gestured to a brass set. [266] "Those ring when the nor'easter comes—he'd stay home. [275] The ceramic ones chime soft—he'd take the boat out." [285]

"That's just wind patterns," Mara said automatically. [292]

"Is it?" [294] The keeper's smile held protected vulnerability, like he was offering something precious while ready to snatch it back. [311] "Or is it about learning which questions to ask? [321] My father didn't hear commands. [326] He heard possibilities." [329]

Mara held up the hollow mirror shard. [336] "I found this after Vincent's case fell apart. [345] I kept thinking if I looked through it enough, I'd see clearly again." [359]

"And do you?" [362]

"I see through it," she said. [368] "That's the problem. [371] It's empty in the middle. [376] Everything passes through unchanged." [380]

The keeper took the shard gently, held it to the rising sun. [393] Light scattered through its hollow center onto the deck, fragmenting into colors. [406] "Not unchanged," he said. [410] "Transformed. [411] Refracted." [412] He handed it back. [416] "You've been looking for clarity. [422] Maybe you need to welcome nuance into certainty instead." [431]

The wind picked up, and three chime sets sang together—copper, bamboo, glass. [444] Mara listened, really listened, hearing how their melodies overlapped without canceling each other out. [458] "I told Vincent his brother was a criminal who deserved prison," she said. [471] "I never asked about the nephew's age, the brother's remorse, whether rehabilitation was possible." [485] Her throat tightened. [488] "I gave him certainty when he needed wisdom." [496]

"So now?" [498] the keeper asked. [501]

"Now I unhook myself from the old way." [509] Mara turned the hollow mirror shard, watching dawn refract through it. [520] "Start offering questions instead of answers. [526] Help people sit with their doubts instead of banishing them." [536] She smiled, feeling both frightened and free. [543] "Become a conscience for hire who admits she's still learning what conscience means." [556]

The keeper gestured to the chimes. [562] "The wind never gives the same message twice. [571] That's not weakness. [574] That's adaptation." [576]

Mara clipped the hollow mirror shard to the railing beside the glass chimes. [589] It caught the breeze and spun, casting rainbow fragments across the weathered wood. [602] She'd return for it later—or maybe leave it there, a small offering to the beauty of uncertainty. [619] Below, the tide was changing. [624] She descended toward it, the cloak of doubt now fitting differently on her shoulders—not a burden, but a garment she'd finally learned to wear. [648]

The lighthouse beam clicked off as full morning arrived. [657] Behind her, the wind chimes sang their complicated, contradictory song. [667] Mara listened all the way down. [673]
