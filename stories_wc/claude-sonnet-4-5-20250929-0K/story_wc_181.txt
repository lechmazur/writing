The curator stood in the conservatory dome, bewildered by the letter in her trembling hands. [15] Around her, the astral orchard bloomed in defiance of physics—peach trees heavy with luminous fruit, their roots drinking starlight filtered through the asteroid's crystalline substrate. [42] She had inherited this place from an aunt she'd never met, who had inherited it from a cousin twice removed who hadn't been born yet. [71] Nonlinear inheritance, the solicitor had called it, as if those words explained anything. [85]

The letter mentioned a pistachio shell cameo blank, simply complicated in its significance. [98] Her aunt—or future-cousin, or whatever temporal impossibility had owned this orchard—had left specific instructions about finding it. [117] "Between the first and last page," the letter read, though no book was mentioned. [132]

Maya had curated collections for thirty years, organized chaos into meaning, but this defied every principle she knew. [149] The trees shouldn't exist here. [154] The asteroid shouldn't support atmosphere. [159] Yet fruit ripened in perpetual twilight, and she could breathe, and the disquiet that had settled in her chest since arriving felt somehow bright, as if fear itself had learned to phosphoresce. [193]

She needed to inquire with someone, anyone, but her communications array had malfunctioned upon approach. [208] Perhaps that was the point. [213] Perhaps some knowledge demanded isolation. [218]

The orchard keeper's cottage held few possessions—a bed, a table, a bathroom with a mirror that showed reflections three seconds delayed. [240] Maya spent the first night pacing, the second cataloging trees by species that shouldn't crossbreed, and the third soaking in the copper tub, watching her future-self's confusion fade before her own had fully formed. [273]

That's when understanding arrived, as it often did for her, in the vulnerability of hot water and solitude. [292] Her greatest breakthroughs had always come in bathrooms—the realization that the museum's Renaissance collection was a forgery network, the solution to authenticating the Mesopotamian tablets, the truth about her marriage ending. [324] Something about steam and silence dissolved the barriers between knowing and understanding. [337]

The first and last page weren't literal. [344] They were temporal. [347] The orchard existed between her arrival and her death—both moments simultaneously present in this folded pocket of spacetime. [365] The cameo blank wasn't hidden in space but in duration. [376]

She climbed from the bath and dressed quickly, purpose clarifying her movements. [388] The trees grew in spiral patterns, she'd noticed, and spirals suggested chronology. [401] At the center, an ancient pistachio tree stood alone, its shells scattered beneath like discarded possibilities. [418]

Maya knelt in the loam of crushed starlight and soil. [429] Each shell held microscopic etchings—faces, formulas, fragments of forbidden knowledge that collectors had pursued across centuries. [445] Her aunt hadn't left her an orchard. [453] She'd left her a library of what shouldn't be known, carved into the most disposable of objects, preserved in the most impossible of places. [477]

One shell remained blank. [481] She lifted it with curator's hands, understanding its simply complicated purpose. [493] The knowledge here was alive, nonlinear, passed backward and forward through bloodlines that tangled through time. [509] This blank space waited for her contribution—whatever forbidden truth she would discover during her tenure between arrival and ending. [528]

The shell felt warm against her palm. [535] She thought of museums, those temples of knowing, always pursuing what was lost or hidden. [550] But this collection pursued her, had always been pursuing her, from before her birth and after her death. [569]

Maya smiled in the phosphorescent twilight. [575] The disquiet remained but no longer frightened her. [583] She would tend these impossible trees. [589] She would fill the blank shell with whatever truth bloomed here. [601] And someday, someone she'd never meet—or had already met, or would birth in a timeline perpendicular to her own—would stand bewildered in this orchard, holding a letter and wondering how knowledge could flow backward through inheritance like water spiraling up a drain. [644]

The answer would come to them too, she suspected, in steam and silence. [657] Between their first and last page. [663] In a bathroom mirror, three seconds behind themselves, learning that some things couldn't be curated—only cultivated, only lived, only passed along through the simply complicated channels of time's own strange fruit. [694]
