The widow lived in a loft where rain drummed constantly against the skylight, each droplet a small lens catching the gray afternoon. [22] Margot had inherited the space from Roland, along with his whips, his scarred chairs, and the ash wood carving blank he'd been meaning to shape for twenty-three years. [50] She set the kettle on the hotplate and watched the rain bead and roll, her hands turning the pale block of wood over and over. [75]

Here and gone—that's what the lions had been, magnificent during their brief performances, then vanished back into cages or memory. [96] Roland too had possessed that quality, electric under the big top lights, absent even when sitting beside her at breakfast. [117] The ash wood felt solid, real, a promise he'd never kept but also never broken. [133] She had decided, in the rust-hued peace of widowhood, that she would complete what he'd started. [150]

The carving would be hauntingly practical, like everything she'd learned from circus life: beautiful but useful, ornamental but grounded. [169] She needed to contain something in this wood—not grief exactly, but understanding. [182] The kettle began its first tentative whisper. [189]

Margot had spent the morning sorting through Roland's journals, leather-bound books filled with sketches of lions mid-leap, notes on training philosophies, and unexpectedly tender observations about light through canvas. [217] One entry stopped her: "The lions teach presence through crystallized time—each moment with them is absolute, cannot be borrowed from or lent to any other moment. [243] They live only here, only now. [249] I keep trying to capture that." [255]

She understood then what the carving blank represented. [263] Roland had wanted to freeze a moment, to hold it the way amber holds ancient insects, perfectly preserved. [282] But he'd been afraid to begin, knowing that the first cut would define all others, that choosing meant limiting, that making real meant accepting impermanence. [308]

The widow picked up his smallest knife, tested its edge against her thumb. [321] Rain intensified against the skylight, transforming the loft into an aquarium of gray light. [335] She could make something useful—a handle, a bowl, a spoon. [347] She could make something decorative—a lion's head, a circus wagon, a memorial. [360] Or she could harvest the lessons from loss itself and carve what Roland had been circling around his entire life. [381]

The kettle's whisper grew to a murmur. [388]

She began cutting away everything that wasn't essential, letting the wood dictate its own form through the grain's natural flow. [408] The knife revealed layers, each one a different shade of cream and amber, time made visible in rings. [427] Here: the year they married, a darker band from drought. [438] Gone: the season he broke his shoulder, the wood dense and tight. [451] Here and gone, here and gone, the rhythm of growth and loss spiraling outward from the heartwood. [469]

What emerged wasn't a lion or a cage or even Roland's profile. [482] It was a small bowl, shallow and imperfect, its rim deliberately uneven to show the tool marks, its base still bearing a patch of bark. [508] Hauntingly practical—something to hold keys or coins or nothing at all. [520] Something to contain the crystallized time of their years together without trying to preserve or perfect them. [538]

The kettle screamed. [541]

Margot set down the knife and lifted the bowl to the rain-beaded light. [555] Through the translucent ash wood, she could see the shadow of her own palm, the lifeline creased and dark. [574] The lions had taught Roland about presence, but loss had taught her something else: that making space for what's gone is how you hold what remains. [601]

She poured the boiling water over tea leaves and sat with the bowl and the steam and the endless rain, feeling the rust-hued peace settle deeper into her bones. [630] The carving was finished and unfinished both, like Roland's life, like her own. [644] Here and gone meant not disappearing but transforming, lessons harvested from the wood itself, from the years that grew it, from the hands that finally shaped it into something that could hold, at last, the weight of everything it had been. [687]

Outside, the rain continued its patient instruction against the glass. [698]
