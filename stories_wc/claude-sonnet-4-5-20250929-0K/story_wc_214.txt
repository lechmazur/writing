The tracking station floated in the Belt, a forgotten outpost from humanity's first hungry reach beyond Mars. [16] Kael swept the observation deck with practiced strokes, her mop gliding across floors that hadn't seen another soul in seven years. [35] The brass fixtures gleamed under her care, relics of an age when people still believed shooting stars meant something. [53]

She was the cosmic janitor, the last employee of Station Perseid, maintained by automated payments from a corporation that had dissolved into bankruptcy decades ago. [75] The money kept flowing through bureaucratic inertia, and Kael kept cleaning through something deeper than duty. [90]

Her yellow lantern glass hung by the main telescope, a salvaged piece from the station's original construction. [106] When starlight passed through it, the observation deck filled with amber warmth, transforming the cold void beyond into something almost sacred. [127] She'd polished that glass every morning for seven years, watching it catch and hold the light of distant suns. [146]

Tonight, she traced the path of falling stars across her display screens, following their trajectories with a finger that left no mark on the pristine surface. [171] This was her meditation, her prayer. [177] Each meteor carried iron from dead worlds, fragments of stories that would never be told. [192] She logged them all in the station's ancient database, though no one would ever read her reports. [209]

Through the hush of an overlooked era, Kael had discovered what others called flourishing stillness. [224] The universe moved around her in vast spirals while she remained centered, cleaning and watching, watching and cleaning. [242] Her spiritually curious nature had led her here, fleeing a Earth choked with noise and certainty, seeking questions instead of answers. [262]

She'd learned to empathize with the meteors, those small deaths burning bright. [274] Each streak of light was something surrendering to gravity, to fate, transforming destruction into beauty. [289] They found strength in vulnerability, just as she had. [298] Her own journey to this isolated station had been a kind of falling, a letting go of everything she'd built—career, relationships, the person she'd pretended to be. [326]

The primal elegance of the cosmos taught her daily lessons. [336] Tonight, a particularly bright meteor shower painted the darkness. [345] Kael dimmed the station lights and lit her yellow lantern glass, setting it beside the viewport. [361] The golden glow merged with the silver streaks outside, and she felt the boundary between self and universe blur. [380]

She thought about the scientists who'd once staffed this station, frantically recording data, publishing papers, seeking recognition. [397] They'd missed it entirely—the point wasn't to capture the stars but to witness them. [412] To clean each surface until it reflected light purely. [422] To trace each falling path until you understood that falling was just another form of flying. [439]

Her mop moved in slow circles, a spiral matching the galaxy's rotation. [451] Dust gathered even in the void's edge, cosmic particles that drifted through microscopic seals. [465] She gathered them gently, honored them as fellow travelers. [474] Everything was moving through space together, falling around the sun, the sun falling around the galactic core, the galaxy falling through expanding darkness toward an unknowable destination. [502]

The yellow lantern glass cast her shadow long across the deck. [513] In that shadow, she saw the shape of the person she'd been—ambitious, afraid, armored against uncertainty. [530] And in the light beyond, she saw what she was becoming—permeable, present, powerful in her acceptance of smallness. [549]

Another meteor flared and faded. [554] Kael logged it: Trajectory 847, mass point-three kilograms, velocity eighteen kilometers per second, duration two-point-one seconds. [570] Then she added what the old protocols never requested: "Beautiful. [579] Necessary. [580] Brief enough to matter." [584]

She returned to her cleaning, to her watching, to the flourishing stillness that bloomed in forgotten places. [601] The station would operate until its systems failed, and she would maintain it until that ending came. [618] Some might call this exile or escape, but Kael knew it as arrival. [631] She had traced the path of falling stars until she understood their secret—that surrender itself was a kind of strength, that vulnerability was the only honest relationship with infinity. [661]

The yellow lantern glass flickered slightly in a ventilation current, scattering amber across polished brass. [676] Kael smiled, set down her mop, and watched the universe fall upward into light. [691]
