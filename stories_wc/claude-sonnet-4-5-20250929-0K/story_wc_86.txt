The parapet stretched along the fortress wall like a stone ribbon fraying at the edges, storm-worn and slick with mist that rolled in from the valley below. [29] Katrin pressed her palm against the ancient stones, feeling centuries of rain and wind etched into their surface. [47] This neutral territory, claimed by neither the Northern Coalition nor the Southern Alliance, existed in a peculiar liminal space—perfect for what she did. [70]

She was a prisoner exchange negotiator, though the title felt inadequate for the weight she carried. [86] Each exchange happened in the fraught timeframe between apology and forgiveness, when nations had acknowledged their wrongs but trust remained unbuilt. [107] That span could last minutes or months, and Katrin inhabited it like a ghost between worlds. [123]

Tonight's exchange had complications. [127] The Northern Coalition had captured Lieutenant Drevan three moon phases ago, while the Alliance held Captain Soren in a mountain garrison. [147] Both sides wanted their officer back, but neither trusted the other enough to release simultaneously. [163] That's where Katrin's uncommonly thoughtful approach came in—she had developed a method of synchronizing exchanges through moon phases, using the neutral predictability of celestial movement to build confidence between enemies. [192]

She withdrew the antique drawer pull from her coat pocket, its brass worn smooth by decades of hands. [210] Her grandmother, also a negotiator, had given it to her with cryptic advice: "Sometimes you must open what's been closed to untether what's been bound." [234] Katrin had carried it through seventeen exchanges, and each time she understood the wisdom more deeply. [251]

The mist swirled as footsteps approached from both directions. [261] Northern guards emerged from the eastern stairwell, Lieutenant Drevan between them, gaunt but upright. [275] From the west came Alliance soldiers with Captain Soren, whose beard had grown wild during captivity. [291]

"Stop there," Katrin said, her voice a furrowed hush that somehow carried across the windblown parapet. [307] Both groups halted ten paces from where she stood at the center point. [321] "We proceed as agreed—when the moon reaches its apex in exactly"—she checked her pocket watch—"four minutes, both prisoners walk forward simultaneously." [344]

"What if they run?" [348] The Northern commander's distrust was palpable. [355]

Katrin turned the drawer pull over in her fingers. [365] "Then we all lose, and I'll have to negotiate again next moon phase, and the one after that, until you're both tired enough of this dance to finally trust the process." [396] She paused, letting the wind carry her words. [406] "Or we can recycle these mistakes into wisdom right now." [417]

That motivation—turning failure into learning—had guided her through every negotiation. [428] She'd seen exchanges collapse, watched soldiers die in crossfire born of mistrust, attended memorials for people who should have made it home. [450] Each loss had taught her something: patience, precision, the power of neutral ground, the importance of natural rhythms that no human could manipulate. [472]

The moon emerged from behind a cloud bank, silvering the mist. [484]

"Lieutenant Drevan apologized for his incursion across your border," Katrin said to the Alliance soldiers. [500] "Captain Soren has acknowledged the intelligence operation he ran in your cities," she told the Northern guards. [518] "Both apologies are documented, witnessed, recorded. [525] The forgiveness—that's yours to grant or withhold. [534] But these two men deserve to go home." [542]

She held up the drawer pull so both sides could see it. [555] "My grandmother kept this from a desk where a treaty was signed ending a fourteen-year war. [573] Someone had to open that drawer first, untether themselves from the hatred that felt so comfortable, so justified." [592] She pocketed it again. [596] "The moon won't wait." [601]

Silence filled the parapet, broken only by wind whistling through battlements. [612]

Then, as the moon reached its apex, both commanders nodded. [623] The prisoners walked forward, their footsteps synchronized not by command but by shared exhaustion, shared hope. [639] They passed Katrin simultaneously, each man's eyes meeting hers with gratitude that needed no words. [655]

When they reached their respective sides, Katrin finally exhaled. [665] Another mistake recycled into wisdom. [670] Another binding untethered. [673] She remained on the parapet as both parties descended, a solitary figure in the mist, already calculating moon phases for the next exchange. [696]

The neutral territory would wait, patient as stone, for whoever needed it next. [710]
