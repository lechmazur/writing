The last ship had sailed three hours ago, its lanterns fading into the fog like dying stars, and Maren stood alone in the shadowed garden where autumn had painted everything in shades of rust and gold. [35] She had traveled here to write another obituary for the living, her peculiar profession taking her to places where people mourned themselves before death could claim them. [64] The palace behind her loomed silent, its windows dark except for one chamber on the eastern wing, where her subject waited. [87]

Maren had been hired by the Duchess herself, a woman who explained her prolonged absences from court not as illness or madness, but as a kind of geographical exile from her own life. [119] "I am here, but I project my presence elsewhere," the Duchess had written in her letter, "and I need someone to map the distance between who I was and who I remain." [153]

The garden path wound between skeletal rose bushes and bronze chrysanthemums that released their bitter perfume into the cooling air. [173] Maren touched the thread in her pocket, a single strand of crimson silk she had pulled from the palace carpet's weft that morning. [197] The carpet depicted a map of the kingdom before the wars, when cities stood where now only memorial stones marked absence. [218] She carried such objects always—small anchors to connect the living to the places they had lost inside themselves. [237]

Through the french doors, she could see the Duchess at her writing desk, quill moving across paper with desperate urgency. [257] Maren had learned that obituaries for the living required intimacy, a willingness to sit close enough to hear the small sounds of grief: the catch in breath, the pause before speaking a lost child's name, the way hands trembled when memory became too vividly descriptive. [300]

She entered without knocking. [304] The Duchess looked up, her face a landscape of lonesome splendor—beautiful still, but marked by the erosion of years spent explaining why she could not attend her own life. [332]

"You've been walking the garden," the Duchess said, not quite a question. [345]

"I needed to understand the geography of healing," Maren replied, settling into the chair across from her. [364] "Your letter mentioned the roses. [370] How you planted them the summer before your daughter died." [381]

The Duchess's fingers tightened around her quill. [388] "They bloom in places I cannot reach. [396] I tend them by projecting my presence there—I imagine my hands in the soil, imagine the thorns catching my skin." [417] She held up her unmarked palms. [424] "But the wounds never appear." [429]

Maren withdrew the crimson thread, letting it catch the lamplight. [439] "This came from the carpet in the main hall. [449] The one your mother commissioned when you were born." [458]

Recognition flickered across the Duchess's face. [464] "I haven't walked that hall in seven years." [473]

"I know," Maren said gently. [478] "You've explained your absence as mourning, as responsibility, as a hundred different sorrows." [492] She leaned forward, the gesture intimate and careful. [501] "But what if you stopped explaining? [507] What if you simply let yourself be absent until you're ready to return?" [521]

The Duchess began to weep, quietly, her shoulders shaking with the release of something long held. [537] Outside, wind moved through the garden, scattering leaves across the flagstones in patterns that looked almost like writing. [556]

Maren took her hand, feeling the pulse beneath the skin—proof of life, even in this shadowed place. [574] "Your obituary," she said, "will say that you died to the world for a time, but that death was not final. [596] That you learned to map your own returning." [605]

The Duchess squeezed her fingers, and in that pressure, Maren felt the beginning of something she had witnessed many times before: the slow work of a soul finding its way back to the body it had abandoned. [640]

As night deepened around them, Maren began to write, her words vividly descriptive yet tender, chronicling not an end but an intermission—the space between ships, between seasons, between the person one was and the person one might still become. [676]

The crimson thread lay between them on the desk, a small bridge across an unmapped distance, glinting like a route home. [697]
