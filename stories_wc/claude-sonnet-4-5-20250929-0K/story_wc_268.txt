The diminutive titan stood no taller than a child's doll, yet his presence commanded the ancient temple library as if he were carved from the mountain itself. [30] His name was Ossian, and he had watched kingdoms rise and crumble through the pause of shifting constellations, waiting in this place lost to time for the moment when duty would call him forth again. [66]

The library existed in a fold between moments, its stone shelves housing volumes that recorded histories yet unwritten and truths long forgotten. [89] Dust motes hung suspended in shafts of impossible light that fell from windows opening onto skies that belonged to no particular age. [112] Here, Ossian had remained, regally unpretentious in his guardianship, neither boasting of his power nor diminishing his sacred charge. [131]

The iron gall ink pellet arrived on a Tuesday that might have been a Thursday, delivered by no messenger Ossian could perceive. [153] It materialized beside a particular tome bound in constellation-leather, and he understood immediately what it signaled: the pretender had made their move in the world beyond. [180]

For weeks—or perhaps centuries, time being what it was here—Ossian had suspected something amiss. [196] Cryptic messages left in library books had begun appearing, marginalia that twisted truth into comfortable lies. [212] Someone was rewriting the royal lineage, subtly altering the records that determined succession. [226] The changes were masterful, nearly invisible, but Ossian had guarded these texts since before the temple had fallen out of synchronization with the mortal realm. [252]

He dissolved the ink pellet in a basin of starlight-water and began his work. [267] With a quill carved from a petrified lightning bolt, he composed his own messages, inserting them into the very books the pretender had corrupted. [291] But Ossian's notes were different—they contained fragments of the rune of drift, an ancient symbol that caused certainty to dissolve and truth to surface like oil on water. [318]

The rune was dangerous, beautiful in its way, like watching a cathedral spire topple in slow motion. [335] It did not destroy falsehood violently but allowed it to come gracefully undone, collapsing under the weight of its own impossibility. [357]

Night after night—though the library knew no true night—Ossian moved through the stacks, finding each corrupted passage. [377] The pretender was clever, had scattered their lies across dozens of volumes, establishing a false genealogy through repetition and subtle consistency. [399] But lies, however well-crafted, could not withstand the rune of drift. [411]

As Ossian inscribed the final fragment in a chronicle of coronations, he felt the fabric of deception begin to sunder. [430] The pretender's carefully constructed ancestry tore like wet parchment, revealing the truth beneath: a minor noble who had murdered their way into position, then hired scholars to rewrite history itself. [459]

In the mortal world, where time flowed in its conventional river, a young woman opened a library book and gasped at the marginalia that seemed to write itself before her eyes. [490] A scholar three kingdoms away found his "authoritative" text on royal succession suddenly displaying corrections in an archaic hand. [509] A priest discovered that the coronation records he had certified as authentic now bore notes explaining exactly how they had been forged. [531]

The pretender's web of lies unraveled across the land in a single, graceful collapse. [546]

Ossian set down his quill and allowed himself the smallest smile. [557] His vigil in this place between heartbeats would continue, as it had always continued, but today's work was complete. [577] The throne would pass to its rightful heir, and the pretender would face judgment for crimes that history—the true history, which Ossian himself preserved—would not forget. [604]

He returned the iron gall ink pellet's basin to its shelf, watching as the starlight-water evaporated into constellations that drifted up toward the impossible ceiling. [629] Outside the windows, the stars wheeled through their ancient dance, and Ossian, diminutive and eternal, resumed his watch over the words that shaped the world. [653]

In the margins of a thousand books, fragments of the rune of drift continued their patient work, ensuring that truth, however long buried, would always find its way back to light. [684]
