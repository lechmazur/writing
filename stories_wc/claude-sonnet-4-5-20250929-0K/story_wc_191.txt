The lore keeper descended through centuries of paint, her scanner crackling against the chapel's wall. [14] Each frequency pulse peeled back another era—industrial gray, baroque gold, medieval crimson—until the hidden mural emerged: a map to the orchard that shouldn't exist. [36] Kaida had spent three decades cataloging the empire's forgotten places, but this discovery made her pulse quicken with the kind of wisely adventurous certainty that separated historians from treasure hunters. [63] The mural showed a kaleidoscopic waterfall behind the old palace ruins, and within its prismatic curtain, trees bearing fruit that looked like crystallized stars. [87]

She had until sunrise. [91] The orbital mirrors would activate at dawn, flooding the ruins with artificial daylight and alerting the autocrats who'd claimed the palace as a museum to their own manufactured legacy. [116] They'd sealed the throne room a century ago, declaring no one worthy of the seat their ancestors had abandoned. [135] But Kaida's research suggested the unclaimed throne was never meant to be sat upon—it was a marker, a beginning point for the stairway of ascension that the ancient texts described in metaphor and mathematics. [168]

The journey to the ruins took an hour by rail-bike, the magnetic tracks humming beneath her like a lullaby from the world-that-was. [190] Futuristic nostalgia, her mentor had called this feeling—mourning technologies more elegant than what replaced them, grieving futures that never arrived. [209] The palace loomed against the stars, its smart-stone walls still shifting through programmed patterns: cherry blossoms in spring, autumn leaves in fall, snow in winter, though the seasons themselves had become unreliable. [239]

She found the waterfall where the mural promised, hidden behind a collapsed conservatory. [252] It didn't flow with water but with light—thousands of fiber-optic threads cascading from an ancient projector, refracting through crystalline minerals into rainbow curtains. [274] Kaida pushed through, and the light parted like beaded curtains in grandmother's stories, each strand cool against her skin. [293]

The orchard existed in impossible space, perhaps folded through dimensions the old empire had mastered before collapsing into factions. [311] Trees grew in spiral patterns, their bark etched with circuit-like grooves that pulsed with bioluminescence. [326] The fruit resembled nothing in modern databases—translucent pods containing what looked like trapped nebulas. [341] And there, at the orchard's heart, she saw it: a single ruby flake suspended in a column of light, rotating slowly, casting red shadows across the grass. [367]

As she approached, the flake spoke—not in sound but in pure data streaming directly into her neural interface. [385] It showed her the truth: the throne room's floor contained the stairway, but only someone who understood ascension's real meaning could activate it. [407] Not climbing to power, but ascending to understanding. [415] Not ruling others, but serving memory itself. [422]

Kaida lifted the ruby flake. [427] It dissolved against her palm, warm as blood, and suddenly she could see them—the hidden engravings beneath every surface of the palace, instructions written in dead languages she'd spent her life learning. [456] She ran, her footsteps echoing through the orchard as she made her sally back toward the throne room. [475]

The palace recognized her now, walls shifting to reveal passages that hadn't existed moments before. [490] The throne room's doors opened without resistance. [497] The empty throne sat upon a floor of dark glass, and Kaida knelt, pressing her palms flat, feeling for the seams the ruby flake's knowledge had revealed. [522]

The glass began to shift, layers peeling away like paint beneath her scanner's pulse, revealing steps that descended into light. [542] Not up—down. [545] Ascension had never meant climbing above others, but diving deeper into the truth beneath empire's painted facades. [562]

The first rays of orbital sunrise touched the palace walls. [572] Kaida descended, step by step, into the archive the old empire had hidden from its own corruption. [590] She was a lore keeper, and she'd finally found what had always been waiting: a throne claimed not by sitting, but by remembering. [612]
