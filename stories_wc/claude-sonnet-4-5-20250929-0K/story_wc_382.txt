The meteor shower painted silver streaks across the October sky as Elena climbed the fire escape to Mrs. Kovac's rooftop garden. [21] Three months ago, she'd knocked on the old woman's door to borrow sugar—a transparent excuse, since the corner store was closer than her neighbor's apartment. [48] But Elena had noticed the Latin inscriptions carved into their building's limestone facade, symbols she couldn't decipher, and Mrs. Kovac was rumored to have been a classics professor before retiring. [76]

That first visit had transformed into weekly Thursday evening tea sessions among the potted herbs and flowering vines that Mrs. Kovac cultivated six stories above the city. [103]

"You're late," Mrs. Kovac said without turning, pouring amber liquid into two cups. [116] Her hands moved with that peculiar quality Elena had come to recognize—patiently nimble, like someone who'd spent decades conjugating irregular verbs and now pruned rosemary with the same deliberate grace. [147]

"The subway stalled." [150] Elena settled into her usual chair, accepting the cup. [160] "I brought the photograph you asked for." [168]

She withdrew a picture of the cornerstone inscription from her bag. [179] Mrs. Kovac studied it beneath the string lights, then reached into her cardigan pocket and produced an object Elena had never seen before: an antique desk seal, its brass handle worn smooth, its face carved with interlocking symbols. [217]

"This belonged to the architect," Mrs. Kovac said. [225] "Heinrich Moss. [227] Built seventeen buildings in this neighborhood between 1891 and 1903." [237] She pressed the seal against her palm, leaving an invisible impression. [248] "Every cornerstone tells the same lie." [255]

Elena leaned forward. [258] "What lie?" [260]

"That buildings are permanent." [264] Mrs. Kovac's smile carried that mysterious familiarity Elena had felt since their first conversation—as if the old woman recognized something in her student that Elena herself hadn't yet discovered. [293] "The inscriptions promise eternity, but Moss knew better. [302] He embedded another language beneath the Latin, one only certain people can read." [316]

"A dead language?" [319]

"Dying," Mrs. Kovac corrected. [323] "The language of structures speaking to those who'll inherit their decay." [335] She set down the seal. [341] "You asked me to teach you Latin so you could understand old buildings. [355] That was the agreed upon lie between us, wasn't it? [367] You already know Latin." [371]

Elena's breath caught. [374] Above them, meteors continued their ancient trajectories, indifferent to human secrets. [386]

"I've watched you read the inscriptions," Mrs. Kovac continued, her voice gentle but precise. [401] "Your eyes don't move like someone translating. [409] You're not learning a dead language, Elena. [417] You're remembering one." [421]

The tea had gone cold in Elena's hands. [430] "My grandmother used to take me to construction sites when I was young," she said finally. [447] "She'd touch the bricks, the steel beams, and tell me what they were saying. [463] I thought it was imagination. [469] After she died, I tried to forget." [477]

"But the buildings kept speaking." [482]

"Louder every year." [485] Elena traced the rim of her cup. [494] "I thought if I learned Latin properly, academically, I could explain it away as translation. [510] Make it normal." [513]

Mrs. Kovac lifted the desk seal again. [521] "Heinrich Moss was my great-grandfather. [527] He built escape routes into the architecture—passages, hidden rooms, messages in mortar. [540] During the war, those spaces saved lives." [548] She pressed the seal into Elena's palm. [556] "The buildings aren't just speaking to you. [564] They're interrogating you, asking if you'll listen when they need something." [577]

A meteor blazed directly overhead, so bright that the rooftop garden seemed to pulse with green light. [595]

"Will you teach me?" [599] Elena asked. [601] "Not the agreed upon lie. [607] The real language?" [610]

Mrs. Kovac poured fresh tea, and in the gesture Elena saw generations of keepers, guardians of the vocabulary of brick and bone. [632]

"Every Thursday," the old woman promised. [638] "We'll start with foundations and work our way up." [648]

The meteors fell like punctuation marks across an ancient sentence, and the buildings below hummed their approval in a language finally being remembered. [673]

Elena closed her fingers around the seal, feeling its weight settle into her palm like a key she'd been searching for without knowing. [696]

Above them, the stars wheeled on, and below, the city spoke in stone. [710]
