The herbalist's underground garden sprawled beneath the frozen earth like a secret kept from winter itself. [16] Dr. Maya Chen descended the root-carved stairs, her breath misting in the dim bioluminescent glow of mushroom clusters that lined the walls. [37] She wore the guise of a botanical assistant, clipboard in hand, but her true work lay in tracking the metamorphosis of something far stranger than medicinal plants. [64]

Three months ago, the missing had returned—all seventeen of them, walking out of the Cascade forests with soil under their nails and stories that twisted like smoke. [91] Maya's cryptid research institute had sent her undercover to investigate what the locals whispered about: a harmony untamed, they called it, something that sang in frequencies that made gravity itself dance. [122]

The herbalist, Old Marrow, tended his subterranean Eden with gnarled fingers, never questioning Maya's late-night visits to catalog specimens. [141] Tonight, she found him examining a flint arrowhead pressed into the moss near his prized ghost orchids. [159] "They leave these now," he said, his voice crackling like autumn leaves. [171] "The ones who came back. [176] Offerings, maybe. [178] Or warnings." [180]

Maya photographed the arrowhead, noting its impossible placement—the moss showed no disturbance, as if the stone had simply wished itself into existence there. [205] The returned ones all spoke of such objects appearing, gravitationally playful artifacts that fell upward or rested sideways in empty air before settling into normalcy. [231]

"You should listen to the phone," Old Marrow said, gesturing to an ancient cordless handset mounted on the wall between hanging terrariums. [253] "They call sometimes. [256] The forest calls through them." [261]

Maya had dismissed the phone as eccentric decoration, but now she lifted the receiver. [275] Static washed over her, and within it, voices—not quite human, not quite wind. [290] The static-laden confessions emerged in fragments: *We walked into the green cathedral and the trees sang us new names. [309] We metamorphose each night in our sleep now. [318] We are becoming the harmony. [323] It doesn't hurt. [326] It feels like remembering something we never knew.* [334]

Her hand trembled. [337] This was what she'd come to document—evidence of cognitive contamination, biological transformation, something that defied her training. [355] But as the voices continued, she felt her clinical detachment crack like ice. [369]

Old Marrow was brewing tea from herbs that seemed to glow with their own moonlight. [385] "You think you're hunting a creature," he said. [394] "But what if it's hunting a better version of us?" [406]

Maya thought of her mentor, Dr. Voss, who'd vanished into these same woods a decade ago. [422] His disappearance had carved bitterness deep into her, transformed her into this: a woman who pursued impossibilities with frost in her heart. [445] She'd wanted to expose whatever took him, to turn the cosmic absurdity of his loss into something quantifiable, publishable, payback. [467]

But here in this underground garden, surrounded by plants that shouldn't survive without sunlight and messages from people who'd walked through dimensions and back, her bitterness began to metamorphose. [494]

"What if," she whispered to the phone still crackling at her ear, "what if it's actually beautiful?" [511]

The static resolved into laughter—warm, knowing, achingly familiar. [519] Voss's laugh. [521] Not a recording or a memory, but present, alive in whatever frequency the harmony occupied. [536]

Old Marrow handed her the tea. [542] "The arrowhead is for you," he said. [550] "They all leave something before they choose." [557]

Maya picked up the flint, feeling it tug gently upward against her palm, playful and impossible. [573] Outside, winter killed everything it touched. [579] Down here, life persisted in defiance of every natural law, and the returned ones phoned home from forests that were also cathedrals, also promises. [604]

She thought of her report, her career, her carefully constructed fortress of skepticism. [617] Then she thought of turning that decade of bitterness into the cosmic joke it had always deserved to be: a love letter written in the language of the incomprehensible. [646]

"Tell me," she said to Old Marrow, pocketing the arrowhead, "when they return the second time, do they come back at all?" [668]

His smile was frostbitten hope incarnate. [674] "Only if they want to," he said. [682] The phone crackled its static hymn, and somewhere in the garden, something impossible began to bloom. [698]
