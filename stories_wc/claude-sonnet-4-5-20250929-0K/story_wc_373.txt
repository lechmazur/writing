The pirate market beneath the rotting pier smelled of brine and secrets, and Nelle knew both well. [17] She'd grown up measuring time in her father's moonshine runs, learning that silence was survival and trust a currency more volatile than any barrel of corn liquor he'd hauled through these same dark waters. [49] Now she stood at the market's edge, her father's antique watch fob pressed against her palm—brass worn smooth by three generations of runners who'd learned when to move and when to disappear. [78]

The fob no longer connected to any watch. [86] It had become something else: a token, a signal, a promise her father had given to Crenshaw before the federals came. [106] Before everything shattered. [109]

"You're early," Crenshaw emerged from behind stacks of unmarked crates, his frame casting long shadows in the lantern-light filtering through the pier's gaps above. [131] "Sunrise isn't for three hours yet." [138]

"Needed to be sure," Nelle said, curiously steadfast despite the flutter in her chest. [152] This meeting had taken weeks to arrange—false starts and near-misses, messages passed through intermediaries who trusted neither side. [170] The truce of hush they'd agreed upon was fragile: no names spoken, no accusations aired, just this exchange and then silence forever. [192]

She'd come to thwart what she knew he intended. [202] Crenshaw believed her father had stolen from him, believed the watch fob was proof of some betrayal. [219] But Nelle had learned the truth in her father's final days: Crenshaw himself had been the federal informant, had broken their agreement to keep the routes quiet. [245] Her father had kept the fob as insurance, as evidence. [256]

"You brought it?" [259] Crenshaw's voice carried that comforting unease she remembered from childhood visits to the pier—when danger wore friendly faces and spoke in gentle tones. [281]

"I did." [283] She opened her palm, let him see the brass gleaming dully. [295] Around them, the market stirred with its nocturnal commerce: smuggled tobacco, untaxed rum, documents that would remake identities by morning. [313] No one watched them directly, but everyone was watching. [323] That was the nature of this place. [331]

"Your daddy was a good man who made bad choices," Crenshaw said, extending his hand. [346]

Nelle's fingers closed around the fob again. [354] "He made one good choice at the end." [363] She pulled a small recording device from her pocket—new technology, barely legal, the kind that captured sound onto magnetic wire. [384] "He recorded your conversation. [389] The one where you told the federals about the August run." [401]

The market seemed to hold its breath. [409] Sunrise felt very far away. [416]

Crenshaw's expression didn't change, but something shifted in the shadows around them—his people, repositioning. [431] "That device won't help you, girl." [438]

"It already has," Nelle said. [444] She'd made three copies, left them with three different runners her father had trusted. [460] Instructions to release them if she didn't return. [469] "I came here to capture the sound of trust breaking. [480] Wanted to hear you admit it yourself, record how your voice changes when you lie." [496]

She pressed play. [499] Her father's voice emerged, tinny but clear: "Crenshaw, if you're hearing this, it means Nelle found the truth." [517] Then Crenshaw's own voice, from that fatal conversation weeks ago: "The federals paid better than loyalty, old friend." [535]

The silence that followed held weight. [541]

"The truce of hush works both ways," Nelle said finally. [552] "You leave my father's name clean. [559] You leave me alone. [563] And maybe—maybe—these recordings never find their way to the families of the men who went to prison because of you." [585]

Crenshaw stared at her, this moonshine runner's daughter who'd learned her lessons well. [599] Above them, through the rotting planks, the sky was beginning to pale. [613]

"Until sunrise," he said quietly. [619] "Then we're strangers." [623]

"We always were," Nelle replied, pocketing both the fob and the recorder. [636] She walked back through the market, past faces that would forget hers by dawn, carrying her father's silence like armor. [656] The truce would hold because it had to, because in this world beneath the pier, broken trust was a death sentence neither of them could afford. [683]

The water lapped against the pilings as she climbed toward morning. [695]
