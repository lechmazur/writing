The tunnel held every sound twice: once when made, once when returned. [13] Martin stood at its entrance, gripping the pull cord handle of his leaf blower, listening to the silence that wasn't quite silence. [33] Three weeks since Lily's funeral, and the house above still breathed with that terrible quiet. [48] His daughter's laughter had once ricocheted through these basement passages—she'd called them her "singing caves"—but now only absence echoed. [68]

He pulled the cord. [72] The engine coughed, sputtered, died. [77] Again. [78] The machine roared to life, and Martin began. [86]

Other conductors had batons; he had a leaf blower and grief. [97] He moved through the tunnel with mournfully eager steps, angling the nozzle toward corners where dust motes hung suspended like frozen stars. [117] The air blast sent them spiraling, and in their dance, he began to hum. [132] Not a melody, exactly—Lily had inherited her mother's musicality, not his—but something half-remembered from the lullabies he'd sung when she was small. [153]

The tunnel carried his voice back to him, off-key and trembling. [165] "Hush little baby, don't say a word..." [173] The leaf blower's roar provided bass notes, discordant but somehow fitting. [184] He swept the nozzle left, then right, conducting an orchestra of wind and memory. [198]

Martin had discovered this strange practice the week after the funeral, when he'd come down here to escape his wife's weeping. [219] He'd been clearing leaves from the tunnel entrance—autumn's debris always found its way in—when the sound of the blower in that enclosed space had made something shift in his chest. [249] A loosening. [251] A small breaking-through. [254]

Now he came every evening, tending to what couldn't be spoken upstairs, where his wife Sarah moved like a ghost through rooms that had forgotten how to hold joy. [280]

The leaf blower macerated a spider web, ancient and abandoned. [290] Dust became a galaxy. [294] He raised the nozzle higher, humming louder, letting the off-key wind carry his broken lullaby deeper into the tunnel. [312] "Papa's gonna buy you a mockingbird..." [319] The echo brought it back transformed, almost harmonious in its sadness. [330]

Footsteps on the stairs above. [335] Sarah's shadow fell across the tunnel entrance. [343] Martin didn't stop conducting, didn't lower the leaf blower. [352] She descended slowly, her face a question mark. [361]

"What are you doing?" [365] Her voice barely cut through the engine noise. [374]

He killed the motor. [378] In the sudden silence, the tunnel hummed with residual sound, with everything the air remembered. [393] "I'm trying to fill it back up," he said. [403] "The quiet. [405] It's eating us." [408]

Sarah stepped into the tunnel, and the space caught her breathing, doubled it, gave it back. [424] "Show me," she whispered. [428]

He handed her the pull cord handle, guided her hand. [438] The engine roared again. [442] Martin stood behind her, and together they moved through the tunnel, conducting the wind. [456] He began the lullaby once more, and this time—after a moment—Sarah joined him. [471] Her voice had always been beautiful, but now it cracked and wavered, as off-key as his own. [488]

"And if that mockingbird don't sing..." [495] The tunnel took their voices, braided them with machinery and moving air, sent them back richer. [511] Sarah laughed—sudden, startled, broken. [516] Then she was crying. [520] Then laughing again. [523]

They stood in the echo chamber as sound became something solid: grief, yes, but also the memory of joy, the ghost of a little girl who had loved how her voice bounced off these walls. [553] The lullaby ended. [556] Began again. [558] Ended. [559]

The leaf blower ran out of gas finally, its roar diminishing to a wheeze, then nothing. [575] The tunnel held the last notes of their singing, turning them over and over, reluctant to let go. [593]

"Tomorrow?" Sarah asked, her hand still on the cord. [603]

"Tomorrow," Martin agreed. [606]

They climbed the stairs together, leaving the tunnel to its echoes, carrying something unnamed but necessary back into the house above: not happiness, not yet, but the beginnings of sound returning to rooms that had forgotten music. [640] The quiet upstairs seemed less absolute now, as if even absence could learn to sing if you taught it the right lullaby, conducted it with enough mournfully eager love. [667]

After the final grain slips through the hourglass, Martin understood, you don't stop time. [681] You fill what remains with whatever symphony you can make from wind and grief and memory. [697]

And sometimes, in the filling, laughter remembers its way home. [707]
