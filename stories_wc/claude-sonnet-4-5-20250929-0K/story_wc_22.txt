The coachman of Gloom Hill arrived at the blooming jetty just as twilight painted the horizon in shades of ash and violet. [22] His cart rattled with glass jars containing dried seed pods, each one labeled in languages no living tongue could speak. [41] Where the old reef had died three seasons past, the jetty had transformed into something unexpected—a wild garden emerging from salt-crusted boards and barnacled posts. [65]

He stepped down carefully, his boots finding purchase on wood slick with evening dew. [78] The narrow pathway stretched before him into a vastness of darkening water, and he felt the familiar contradiction settle into his bones—this confined space that somehow contained infinity. [107]

"Mortuus est campus, vivat hortus," he whispered to himself, the dead Latin fitting his purpose perfectly. [124] The battlefield must die so the garden may live. [134]

Fifteen years he had driven supplies to the naval outpost here, watching young soldiers board ships that would sail to the disputed waters beyond. [156] When the reef died—poisoned by the weapons they'd dumped after the ceasefire—he thought this place would become another monument to waste. [177] Instead, the birds had come. [182]

First the terns, then the plovers, and finally the rare spindle-beaks that nested only where death gave way to new life. [203] The coachman had always understood their calls, a gift inherited from his grandmother who'd mapped migration patterns in scripts even older than Latin. [226] The birds sang not just of wind and fish, but of seeds carried in their bellies, of spores clinging to their wings. [249]

He opened the first jar and scattered blackthorn seeds along the jetty's edge, then knelt to work them into the cracks between boards where soil had begun to accumulate. [277] To fertilize properly, he needed to understand what the birds were telling him about the currents, the salt content, the way nutrients from the dead reef below were rising with each tide. [310]

A spindle-beak landed nearby, its call sharp and questioning. [319] "Quid hic facis?" he asked it in Classical Greek, then answered himself: "What am I doing? [334] I'm listening." [336]

The bird sang three descending notes, and he understood—the southern corner of the jetty, where wood met water, needed the salt-resistant pods. [358] The western posts, catching the last sunlight, required the climbing vines with sunset-colored blooms. [373] And here, in the middle where soldiers had once stood watch, the forget-me-nots would thrive if planted deep enough to reach the submerged concord between saltwater and sweet, where fresh springs bubbled up through cracks in the dead reef. [411]

That submerged concord—it was the key to everything. [420] Beneath the surface, where no one looked anymore, the war's end had created an unexpected harmony. [436] Freshwater springs, no longer disturbed by depth charges and submarines, had found their way through the reef's corpse. [454] Salt and sweet mixed in perfect balance, and in that mixing, life returned. [468]

He worked through twilight into near-darkness, his fingers remembering the shapes of seeds his grandmother had taught him to recognize by touch alone. [490] The birds continued their instructions, and he continued his translations, speaking to them in Akkadian, in Linear B, in languages that predated the concept of borders worth fighting over. [516]

By the time the first stars appeared, the jetty bloomed with potential. [528] Seeds nestled in every crack, every crevice, every space where wood had splintered under the weight of military equipment now removed. [548] In spring, this narrow path would explode with color—a vastness of life emerging from the strict confines of treated timber and rusted nails. [571]

The spindle-beak sang once more, a complex melody that spoke of seasons turning, of roots finding purchase, of battlefields becoming gardens through patience and understanding. [594]

"Gratias ago," the coachman replied in Latin, thanking the bird, thanking the dead reef, thanking the submerged concord that made redemption possible. [614] He gathered his empty jars and climbed back onto his cart, leaving the blooming jetty to its transformation. [631]

Behind him, in the gathering dark, the first seeds began their work of reclamation. [645]
