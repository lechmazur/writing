Dr. Marianne Clare had stopped believing in fairy stories the year her daughter disappeared, though she never stopped forgiving those who still did. [23] When the village constable pulled that substitute body from the millpond—a construction of straw and river clay so convincing it had fooled them all for three days—the old certainty cracked open like an egg. [56] 

She found herself walking the Blackwood estate's hedge maze at dusk, following half-remembered instructions from her grandmother's journals. [74] The maze had always been there, overgrown and forbidding, but the secret garden behind its final turn revealed itself only to those who had learned to doubt their doubts. [103]

The garden was impossibly wrong for November. [109] Roses bloomed in colors that had no names, and the air tasted of copper and honey. [125] In the center stood a stone table, and on it: a single baby tooth, root still pink with blood. [145]

Marianne recognized it immediately, though she'd spent ten years convincing herself otherwise. [157] Her daughter Iris had lost this exact tooth the week before she vanished, before they'd found what everyone insisted was Iris's body in the woods. [181] The body they'd buried. [185] The body that was probably no more real than the straw man in the millpond. [200]

She picked up the tooth with shaking hands. [208] Her late husband had called her shrewdly innocent once, amused by how she could see through everyone's lies while still choosing to believe in their better nature. [234] But she'd missed the biggest deception of all, hadn't she? [245] She'd buried something that wasn't her daughter and told herself it was grief that made the corpse feel wrong under her examining fingers. [268]

The tooth was warm. [272] Alive. [273]

"You always were better at bone setting than knowing," a voice said behind her. [287]

Marianne turned to find a woman who looked like Iris might look now, at eighteen, if she'd grown up somewhere that wasn't quite earth. [311] Her eyes held too many seasons. [317]

"The substitute told you true," the woman said. [325] "I was taken. [328] Changed. [329] The you from ten years ago couldn't have accepted that—you needed certainty then, even false certainty." [345] She stepped closer. [348] "But you've learned to live in the cleft now, haven't you? [360] Between knowing and not-knowing." [364]

Marianne wanted to yearn, to grab this possible-daughter and never let go, but her skeptic's training held. [381] "Why now?" [383]

"Because you're ready to understand what mother did." [391] The young woman gestured at the garden. [398] "Grandmother was a bone setter in both worlds. [406] She understood that broken things could be made more beautiful in the reknitting." [419] She touched a rose that bloomed in violet-silver. [428] "She taught me that mistakes aren't endings—they're raw material. [437] Every wrong turn, every fracture, every loss can become something luminous if you know how to set it right." [456]

"Constellations," Marianne whispered, remembering her mother-in-law's strange phrase. [464] Turn your mistakes into constellations. [469] She'd thought it was just comfort. [475]

"I need your help," Iris said. [481] "Others were taken, their families fooled like you were. [490] But the substitutes are degrading—that's why the millpond one failed. [500] The magic is breaking down, and the children can't come home until someone in both worlds understands how to bridge the gap." [523]

Marianne looked at the tooth in her palm, then at her impossible daughter. [536] The skeptic in her catalogued every reason this couldn't be real. [548] The forgiver in her recognized that certainty had only ever been a comfortable prison. [562]

"Teach me," she said. [565]

The garden brightened, as if it had been waiting centuries for precisely this answer. [579] Iris smiled, took her mother's hand, and together they began the work of bone setting for the between-places, where children lived in the cracks of the world and waited for love to be stronger than logic. [613]

The tooth pulsed once against Marianne's palm, warm as a star being born. [626]

Outside the maze, the modern world continued its clockwork certainty. [636] But in the secret garden, a forgiving skeptic learned an older trade: how to make light from fractures, how to transform every mistake into something that could guide others home. [665]
