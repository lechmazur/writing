The lantern maker's hands had grown cunning over forty years of shaping light, but they trembled now as she polished the memory gem against silk. [25] Her workshop hung suspended in the tea garden on Vesper Isle, where camellia roots grew downward into clouds and upward into soil—the peculiar inversion that made this floating realm possible. [55] After her daughter's shadow had detached three days prior, slipping from her body like silk from skin, Mei had one purpose remaining: to fold her grief into origami cranes, one thousand of them, each encoded with a dream. [92]

The glass basilica rose at the garden's heart, its transparent spires catching sunset in fractured amber. [107] Inside, the Dream Archive waited—shelves of crystallized memories that the basilica's priests recorded from the dying and the desperate. [127] Mei had paid them everything she owned for the right to preserve what remained of Lin, whose shadow now wandered the lower terraces, a grey echo searching for its source. [156]

The memory gem brightened under her polishing cloth, dream-smoke swirling in its depth. [168] Lin's laughter from when she was seven, chasing fireflies through these very paths. [181] Mei had learned the craft of dream recording in secret, bribing a corrupt priest who smuggled techniques from the basilica. [200] The method was precise: polish the gem in decreasing circles while humming the dreamer's name, then press it against the temple of someone sleeping. [224] The dream would flow into stone like honey into a mold. [236]

But Mei had taken it further, transforming the craft into something the priests had never imagined. [251] She folded each recorded dream into paper cranes, the gems embedded in their hearts, then released them from the island's edge. [271] They descended while ascending—another paradox of Vesper Isle—falling toward the earth far below while simultaneously rising into the stratosphere, existing in both trajectories until observation collapsed the possibility. [299] Perhaps in that quantum space, Lin's shadow would reunite with the dreams of her childhood, and something whole might coalesce. [318]

The tea garden's lanterns flickered to life automatically as dusk deepened, each one Mei's handiwork from better years. [334] Crafty innovations made them burn without oil: mirrors arranged to trap sunlight during the day, releasing it slowly through the night. [354] Now their glow felt like luminous torment, beautiful and unbearable. [365] They illuminated the basilica's glass walls, where shadow-touched souls wandered in eternal prayer, seeking reintegration. [380]

Mei lifted the polished gem to the light. [388] Perfect clarity. [390] She had recorded one hundred and forty-seven dreams so far, each folded into precise creases: mountain fold, valley fold, reverse fold, until paper became bird. [413] Eight hundred and fifty-three remained. [419]

Her fingers began the familiar motions, transforming a square of rice paper into a crane's elegant form. [435] The memory gem nestled into the body cavity she'd designed, held by crossed folds. [449] This dream contained Lin's first visit to the basilica, her small hand gripping Mei's as they stared up at the impossible architecture. [470] "Mama, how does glass hold the sky?" she'd asked. [480]

"It doesn't hold it," Mei had answered. [487] "It transforms it into something we can see through." [497]

Now Mei whispered the words again as she creased the final fold. [509] The crane sat complete in her palm, its gem-heart pulsing with captured memory. [522] She walked through the darkening garden to the island's edge, where stone gave way to infinite air. [539] Below, the world spread vast and distant. [546] Above, stars emerged like pin-holes in black paper. [555]

She released the crane. [559]

It descended while ascending, following the impossible physics of this place. [570] Mei watched until it vanished into the luminous torment of dusk, carrying one fragment of her daughter toward wherever shadows go when they forget their bodies. [594]

Eight hundred and fifty-two cranes remained. [600]

Mei returned to her workshop, selected another gem, and began polishing. [611] The glass basilica glowed behind her, full of other people's preserved dreams, other people's attempts to hold what couldn't be held. [631] But Mei was craftier than priests. [637] She would fold every memory of Lin into flight, transform grief into a thousand ascending descents, and perhaps somewhere between falling and rising, shadow and soul would merge again. [665]

The gem brightened under her careful hands. [672]

Outside, another lantern flickered to life, catching the light that had been lost all day, releasing it back into the darkness. [692]

Transform, polish, fold, release. [696]

She had work to do. [701]
