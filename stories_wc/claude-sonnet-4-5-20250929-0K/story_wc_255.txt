The glassblower's courtyard had always been a place of shimmering transformations, but after the phoenix rose from the furnace three days ago, scattering embers across the cobblestones, everything changed. [32] Maya stood among the scorched planters, her paintbrush trembling in her hand as she studied the arrangements her neighbor had left overnight. [53] She was colorblind—had been since birth—yet she'd learned to read the world through texture, placement, and the subtle language others missed. [76]

The burned roses positioned near the eastern arch meant danger. [86] The ferns clustered by the fountain spoke of patience. [96] And the single white lily—she assumed it was white, though to her eyes it registered only as a lighter shade of gray—placed directly before her studio door meant someone needed her gift. [131]

Maya had discovered her peculiar talent by accident: she could paint awakenings. [143] Not the gentle stirring of morning consciousness, but true awakenings—the kind that shook people from years of sleepwalking through their lives. [164] Her colorblindness, rather than limiting her art, had become its power. [176] She painted in values and contrasts that bypassed the eye's usual defenses, reaching directly into the dreaming parts of the mind. [197]

The phoenix's rising had scrambled something in the courtyard's energy, making everyone drowsy, trapped in waking dreams. [214] The glassblower himself hadn't emerged from his workshop in two days. [226] His apprentice wandered the space in circles, trying to remember what fire was for. [241]

Maya followed the plant trail—innocently cunning in its seeming randomness—to the corner where old Tomás kept his music repair shop. [262] Inside, she found him slumped over his workbench, a concertina's brass reed tongue glinting between his fingers like a tiny golden flame. [284]

"I can't wake up," he whispered without opening his eyes. [295] "Not fully. [298] The phoenix's song is still in my head, and I'm trapped between dreaming and seeing." [314]

Maya understood immediately. [317] This was why the plants had led her here. [327] Tomás had been the first to witness the phoenix's emergence, had breathed its smoke, had heard its cry. [346] Now he needed what she could offer, but her paintings weren't charity. [359]

"I'll paint your awakening," she said, "but I need something in return." [372] Her eyes fell on the reed tongue in his hand. [384] "That piece. [386] I need its imperfection." [390]

The reed was bent, slightly tarnished, its edges worn from years of vibration and breath. [405] To anyone else, it was garbage—a failed component. [415] But Maya saw its beauty precisely because it was broken, because it had been used, because it carried the residue of ten thousand songs. [439]

"Bartered awakenings," Tomás murmured, understanding flooding his sleep-fogged mind. [448] "You trade consciousness for broken things." [454]

"For imperfect things," Maya corrected. [459] "There's beauty in what's been worn down by living." [469]

She set up her easel in the courtyard, where morning light filtered through glass wind chimes the glassblower had made before his own drowsiness took hold. [493] The scorched earth crunched beneath her feet. [501] She placed the reed tongue on her palette, using it to mix her paints, letting its vibrations—memory of music—infuse her work. [523]

Maya painted without knowing colors, only knowing contrasts: light against dark, rough against smooth, the texture of consciousness against the silk of dreams. [546] She painted Tomás as she sensed him—a man whose imperfections made him whole, whose worn places were exactly where beauty lived. [568]

When she finished, Tomás opened his eyes fully for the first time in three days. [583] Around them, others began to stir. [590] The glassblower emerged, blinking. [595] His apprentice remembered fire. [599]

And in the courtyard's eastern corner, where Maya had arranged succulents in gratitude, new ferns began unfurling their innocently cunning fronds, ready to guide the next person who needed to wake. [628]

Maya held the bent reed tongue up to the light, seeing in its tarnished surface exactly what she'd always sought: proof that being broken by the world was just another way of being beautiful. [661]

The phoenix might rise again, but some awakenings, once bartered for, remained permanent. [675]
