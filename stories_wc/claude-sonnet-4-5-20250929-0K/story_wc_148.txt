The lighthouse prison had stood for a century on the jagged reef, its walls thick with salt and silence. [19] Matthias arrived at dawn, when the copper light made the ocean look like molten metal. [34] He was the cry wolf boy's son, though no one believed that either—another lie in a lineage of liars. [52]

The warden led him through corridors that smelled of rust and regret. [64] "You have until they find the bodies," she said, her voice flat. [76] "After that, we seal everything." [81]

Three prisoners had vanished from their cells two weeks ago. [91] The official story was escape, but Matthias knew better. [100] His father had died in this place, throat raw from screaming truths no one would hear. [116] Before the end, he'd sent Matthias a single object: a lattice panel from the confessional, its wood carved with his desperate final words. [137] *Chase the hush,* it read. [142] *Find what sustains impossibilities.* [146]

The narrow door to the old chapel wing had been left ajar for decades, its hinges frozen in surrender. [165] Through the scuffs on its surface, Matthias could see layers of paint and scratch marks—messages from men who'd tried to thread this labyrinth with their own stories. [190] He pushed through. [193]

Inside, the chapel was a skeleton of faith. [201] Pews rotted in rows. [205] The confessional booth stood intact, its lattice panel missing—the one now tucked under Matthias's arm. [220] He approached slowly, aware of how sound moved differently here, as if the air itself was learning to hover between moments. [241]

When he fitted the lattice back into its frame, something shifted. [252] The wood began to glow with that same copperlight that gilded the morning sea. [266] Through the lattice's diamond gaps, he saw not the booth's interior but a corridor that shouldn't exist—one that seemed to hover between the lighthouse's known architecture and some other geometry entirely. [296]

Matthias stepped through. [299]

The hidden passage wound through the lighthouse's bones, following paths that sustained impossibilities of space and structure. [315] Rooms nested inside rooms too small to contain them. [325] Stairs descended but somehow climbed. [330] And everywhere, that copper light pooled and flowed like liquid truth. [341]

He found them in a chamber that couldn't be reached but was: the three missing prisoners, huddled around a table, alive. [362] They looked up without surprise. [367]

"You're his son," the oldest one said. [375] "We wondered if you'd chase the hush." [383]

"What is this place?" [387] Matthias asked. [389]

"A space your father discovered," another prisoner replied. [397] "He learned that this prison was built on a reef where reality grows thin. [412] The builders knew—that's why they put criminals here. [422] Not to punish them with walls, but to give them a choice." [435]

The oldest prisoner stood. [439] "Your father tried to tell them. [446] Screamed about the passages, the impossible rooms. [454] They thought he'd gone mad. [459] Classic cry wolf." [462] He smiled sadly. [466] "But we believed him. [470] He threaded this labyrinth with his story so we could follow it." [483]

"Before they find the bodies," Matthias repeated, understanding now. [492] "You're not escaping. [495] You're transforming." [497]

"This place sustains impossibilities," the third prisoner said, his form already beginning to hover at its edges, becoming translucent in the copperlight. [518] "We're learning to exist between what was and what might be. [530] Your father's almost there—almost sustained. [536] We've seen him in the passages, still threading new paths." [547]

Matthias felt the lattice grow warm in his hands. [557] His father hadn't died screaming lies. [563] He'd died screaming directions. [567]

"Will you stay?" [570] the oldest asked. [573] "Help us thread the labyrinth? [579] Add your story to his?" [584]

Through the impossible walls, Matthias heard boots on stairs—the searchers, coming to find what remained of the missing men, to seal this wing forever. [609] He looked at the lattice panel, at the words carved there, at the copper light that made everything seem suspended in amber truth. [633]

His whole life, he'd been the cry wolf boy's son, carrying a liar's legacy. [648] But here, in this place that sustained impossibilities, where passages hovered between one reality and another, he could finally thread his own story through the labyrinth his father had begun. [678]

He stepped fully into the copper light and felt himself begin to hover. [692]

Outside, the searchers would find an empty chapel and another mystery. [704]

Inside the hush, Matthias found his father, still threading paths, still true. [717]
