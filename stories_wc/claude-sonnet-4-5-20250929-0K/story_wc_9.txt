The cartomancer arrived at the midnight glade three days after the birth, when her daughter's first cries still echoed in her bones. [22] She climbed through layers of cloud until she stood on soil that floated impossibly above the world, where moonlight pooled like spilled mercury between ancient oaks. [48] Her fingers trembled as she unfastened the leather case containing her onyx-ink cards, each one marked with symbols she'd drawn in the sleepless hours of early motherhood. [75]

This was cloudbound repentance—the practice of ascending above the living world to account for one's stolen moments. [92] She had come to find where lost time accumulated, all those hours she'd borrowed from sleep, from presence, from her own mother's deathbed to finish just one more reading, one more client, one more card. [125]

The glade choked her with its beauty. [132] Star-flowers grew luminescent between roots, their fragrance so sweet it burned her throat. [146] Everything here hurt in the way that truth hurts, gorgeous and unforgiving. [159]

She spread her reading cloth—the birthday tablecloth from her seventh year, covered in traced hands. [174] This was her family's custom: every birthday, every guest pressed their palm to linen while someone traced it in permanent marker, creating a history of touch. [200] Her grandmother's arthritic fingers overlapped her uncle's broad palm. [210] Her mother's elegant hands appeared seventeen times before disappearing forever. [220] Her own small prints grew larger year by year, until the final trace—her daughter's hand, impossibly tiny, added just before she'd left for this pilgrimage. [246]

She shuffled the onyx-ink cards, willingly perplexed by what they might reveal. [259] The cartomancer who could read anyone's fortune had never dared read her own. [273] Fear was one reason. [277] Pride was another. [281] But mostly she'd been too busy stealing time from everyone who loved her, convinced her work mattered more than moments. [301]

The cards fell in a pattern she'd never seen before: the Hourglass, the Cradle, the Shattered Cup. [319] In the moonlight, the onyx ink seemed to move, and she understood these weren't cards anymore but windows. [337]

Through the first, she saw her mother's hand reaching for hers in the hospital, withdrawn when she'd checked her phone for appointment times. [359] Through the second, she saw her daughter's face, the way the infant's eyes had tracked her movements, learning already that mother's attention lived elsewhere. [383] Through the third—she gasped. [387]

A dolls' tea set lay scattered in grass, and she recognized it. [400] Her childhood treasure, buried with her mother per deathbed request. [411] The saucer bore a crack she'd made at age eight, careless and hurried even then. [427] But here in this glade above clouds, the crack wept luminous sap, and she realized what accumulated lost time became. [448]

It became ghosts of connection, possibilities that haunted the spaces between worlds. [460] Every moment she'd stolen calcified into these phantom objects, things that should have mattered but didn't, because she hadn't let them. [481]

She gathered the cards with shaking hands and pressed them to the birthday tablecloth. [496] Her daughter deserved better than a mother who climbed clouds to find what she'd already abandoned. [512] The repentance wasn't in the seeking—it was in the choice to descend. [525]

She traced her own hand on a bare patch of cloth, next to her daughter's tiny print. [543] Then she traced it again, and again, filling the space with the same hand repeated, a promise written in permanent marker. [565] I will be here. [570] I will be here. [575] I will be here. [580]

The glade released her as dawn broke below the clouds. [591] She descended through layers of mist, clutching her cards and cloth, carrying the choking beauty of what she'd almost lost forever—and the knowledge of what she might still save. [618]

Her daughter was three days old and waiting. [627] Time, she finally understood, didn't need to be found. [637] It needed to be given. [642]

She arrived home as morning light touched the nursery window, unfastened her traveling cloak, and reached into the cradle where real hands could trace real skin, where presence mattered more than any card she'd ever drawn. [675]
