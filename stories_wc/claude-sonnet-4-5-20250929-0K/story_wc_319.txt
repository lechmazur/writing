The cultist's pendant hung from a rusted chain in the center of the frozen garden, swaying in mist so thick it felt like breathing wool. [27] Through the veil of sleep—for that was where Maris now walked—the pendant glowed with a sickly phosphorescence that marked the boundaries of light in this dreaming realm. [57] She had been the library's guardian for three hundred years, but the spell that transformed her had stripped away everything civilized, leaving only feral instinct and an aching intelligence that remembered what it meant to be human. [93]

The mist curled around statues of forgotten gods, their stone features rimed with frost that never melted. [110] Maris crouched low, her fingers—clawed now, covered in coarse fur—digging into frozen earth. [125] She had learned to wait in her centuries of guardianship, to let time pool around her like water until the moment demanded movement. [148]

The pendant belonged to someone who had tried to steal the Codex of Unwritten Hours from her library. [167] She had chased the thief through the waking world and into this place, where dreams crystallized into geography. [185] Here, in sleep's terrain, she could hunt without the iron collar that bound her during daylight hours. [203]

But something had changed. [207]

The pendant pulsed, and with each pulse, Maris felt herself fracturing across dimensions she couldn't name. [223] It was a sensation like homesickness, but for places that didn't exist in any atlas—a dimensional longing for coordinates her body remembered but her mind had never known. [252] The cultist had tried to use the pendant to open doorways between worlds, and now those doorways were opening inside her. [273]

She was interiorizing exteriors, absorbing the frozen garden into her own being until she couldn't tell where the mist ended and her thoughts began. [297] The statues' faces appeared in her memories as people she'd known. [309] The frost on the ground felt like emotions she'd forgotten how to name. [323]

This was the danger of walking through the veil of sleep too often: the dreaming realm wanted to make you part of itself. [347]

Maris forced herself to focus, to remember why she'd come. [358] The pendant was a key, but also a wound in reality. [370] If she destroyed it here, in the place between waking and sleeping, its power would fade in both worlds. [390] But if she failed, the cultist would return with others, and they would tear her library apart looking for texts that should never be read. [415]

She moved forward through the foggy lucidity that characterized this realm—everything sharp-edged and blurred simultaneously, perfectly clear and impossible to grasp. [436] The pendant grew brighter as she approached, and she could see now that it contained a tiny garden of its own, a mirror of the frozen space around her. [465]

To make friends with uncertainty had become her unexpected motivation, the only way to survive as both beast and scholar, both prisoner and protector. [489] She could not know what destroying the pendant would do to her, not while she was partially merged with this dream-space. [510] She might dissolve entirely. [514] She might wake in the library with no memory of her feral self. [528] She might remain trapped here forever, another statue in the garden, conscious but immobile. [542]

Maris reached out with one clawed hand. [549]

The pendant was cold enough to burn, and as her fingers closed around it, she felt the boundaries of light contract and expand simultaneously. [573] The garden inhaled. [576] She pulled, and the chain snapped with a sound like breaking glass. [589]

The mist rushed inward, and Maris felt herself rushing outward, her dimensional homesickness finally resolving into a return—not to any single place, but to the coherent singularity of her own existence. [618] The frozen garden shattered into a thousand dreams, each finding its proper dreamer. [632]

She woke in the library, human-shaped in the morning light, the pendant nothing but rust and ash in her palm. [652] The iron collar was cool against her throat. [661] Outside, she could hear visitors arriving, their footsteps innocent and ordinary. [673]

Maris smiled, closed her fist around the ashes, and waited for night to fall again. [689]
