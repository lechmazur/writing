The falcon returned at dawn, ice crystals frosting its wings. [10] Mira watched from the observation deck of the rusted outpost, her breath forming patterns on the thick glass window—circles within circles, like the tributary maps she'd spent years editing. [38] She had learned to read meaning in such ephemera: the way moisture gathered, dispersed, converged. [54] Today the condensation traced a single point where all droplets seemed to flow, a singular convergence that made her pulse quicken despite her practiced calm. [78]

"You're still chasing ghosts," said Petrov, shuffling in with his morning tea. [90] The old polyglot kept his phrasebook in his breast pocket, its corner dog-eared from constant consultation—a habit from when the outpost had hosted researchers from twelve nations. [116] Now only the two of them remained at this frozen lake, cataloging what the melting ice revealed. [133]

"Not ghosts," Mira replied, her dry wit softening the correction. [143] "Just following the water." [147] She traced the condensation pattern with one finger, not quite touching the glass. [160] "The falcon flew northwest this time. [166] Three days out, three days back." [172]

Petrov studied her subtly confident posture—the way she stood as if she already knew what she'd find, was merely waiting for the world to confirm it. [199] "You think you've found it." [205] Not a question. [208]

"I think," Mira said carefully, "that every atlas I've ever edited shows rivers beginning somewhere else. [224] Mountain springs, glacial melts, underground aquifers. [230] But the watershed patterns never quite balanced." [237] She pulled out her tablet, displaying decades of hydrological maps. [247] "Until the ice started retreating here. [253] Look—every major river system in this hemisphere, traced backward, should originate within forty kilometers of this lake." [271]

The worrying tranquility of the morning pressed against the windows. [281] No wind, no sound beyond their breathing. [288] The frozen lake stretched endlessly white, hiding its secrets beneath meters of ice. [301] But Mira had seen the satellite data, had cross-referenced it with historical maps dating back centuries. [318] Cartographers had always approximated, adjusted, made the maps fit their assumptions. [329] She had made a career of catching such errors, her editor's eye spotting inconsistencies others missed. [345]

"Someone needs to see this," Petrov said finally. [353] "You can't just—the world should know." [360]

Mira smiled faintly. [363] "Then we herald it properly. [368] Not a press release, not a scientific paper buried in journals." [379] She gestured at the condensation pattern, already fading as the sun strengthened. [392] "We document it the way it reveals itself. [401] Patterns within patterns. [404] The method matters as much as the discovery." [413]

She had her gear ready—had kept it ready since sending the falcon out three weeks ago with its tracking beacon. [433] The bird's data confirmed what the condensation suggested, what her years of editing river systems had whispered: somewhere beneath this frozen lake lay the source, the singular point from which countless waterways had once flowed. [469] Climate change hadn't created this mystery; it had merely exposed what ancient ice had hidden. [485]

"Your motivation always seemed obsessive," Petrov admitted. [492] "To find where the rivers begin—it seemed too mythological for someone so practical." [506]

"Myths start somewhere," Mira said, shouldering her pack. [515] The outpost's rust-streaked walls had sheltered her through two winters of preparation. [528] Now, with the ice finally thin enough, she would drill down, would taste the water that fed continents. [547] "Besides, someone has to update the atlases. [555] Might as well be the editor who noticed they were all wrong." [567]

She paused at the door, studying the pattern on the glass one final time. [582] The condensation had dried completely now, leaving only the ghost of its convergence. [595] But Mira had photographed it, had documented the method—how water itself pointed the way home. [611]

"Keep the beacon active," she told Petrov. [618] "When I find it, the falcon will know." [627]

She stepped into the worrying tranquility of the frozen morning, subtly confident, ready to herald the discovery that would redraw every map she'd ever edited. [651]

The ice beneath her boots was older than cartography itself. [662] Soon, she would know what it had been keeping cold and secret all these centuries. [678]
