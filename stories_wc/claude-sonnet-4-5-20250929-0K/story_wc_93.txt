The aurora rippled green and violet above the tidal bluff where Korin knelt, arranging painted rocks in sequences only she could see. [22] Her fingers moved with practiced certainty, placing each stone according to patterns that existed both in memory and premonition—the curse she'd carried since childhood, seeing futures that might never arrive and pasts that hadn't yet occurred. [56] The tide pools around her shimmered with an otherworldly stillness, for friction had vanished from the world three months ago, and water no longer crashed but glided, eels no longer thrashed but drifted like silk through the frictionless deep. [91]

She was the last eel herder on this coast, though herding now meant something entirely different. [107] Without friction, the eels moved in impossible directions, responding only to gravitational pulls and electromagnetic whispers. [123] Korin had learned to harness their movements using the collapsed star dust her grandmother had left her—a vial of matter so dense it bent light around her fingers, so ancient it remembered when the universe knew how to hold things together. [164]

The painted rocks formed a Fibonacci spiral, each number building upon the last, each color corresponding to a frequency her precognitive visions had revealed. [187] Red for the path the eels would take tomorrow. [196] Blue for where they had been in a timeline that never crystallized. [208] Gold for the sacred patterns she sought to understand—the ones her grandmother had promised to explain before friction took her, sliding her away across the frictionless ice, unable to stop, unable to be saved. [241]

That lingering promise haunted every arrangement Korin made. [249]

Tonight's sequence was crucial. [253] Her visions showed her two futures: one where she decoded the pattern and learned why friction had abandoned them, another where the aurora faded and the eels dispersed into the frictionless ocean forever, taking the last remnants of the old world's logic with them. [294]

She sprinkled collapsed star dust over the rocks, watching it settle like fog with weight. [309] The dust created tiny gravity wells, invisible anchors in a world that had forgotten how to grip. [326] The eels sensed these wells immediately. [332] They rose from the tide pools, silvery and translucent, moving in that unsettling frictionless glide, neither swimming nor flying but existing in the space between. [355]

Korin's curse flared. [358] She saw herself completing the pattern—saw the moment three moves ahead when the seventeenth rock would align with the aurora's magnetic field, when the eels would form a living equation, when the collapsed star dust would resonate with the answer her grandmother had tried to give her. [399]

She placed the fourteenth stone. [404] Indigo, shaped like a tear. [409]

The eels circled closer, their bodies forming spirals that mirrored her rock sequence. [422] They knew the sacred patterns too—had always known them. [432] Before friction disappeared, before humans built cities on these bluffs, eels had navigated by these geometric truths. [448]

The fifteenth stone: silver, marked with seven dots. [456]

Her hands trembled. [459] The precognitive curse showed her the answer now, shimmering just beyond reach. [471] The pattern wasn't about bringing friction back. [478] It was about understanding why it had been borrowed in the first place—why this dawn, this moment, this universe was simply returning to its original frictionless state. [506] Her grandmother had known. [510] The eels had always known. [515]

Sixteenth stone: white as pearls, inscribed with a spiral. [524]

The aurora intensified, responding to the pattern taking shape. [533] The eels wove between the rocks now, their bodies conducting the collapsed star dust's gravity into visible threads of light. [552]

Korin lifted the final stone, its surface painted with every color she had used, all frequencies combined. [569] In her vision, she saw herself placing it at the spiral's center, saw the eels converging, saw the answer bloom like bioluminescence in deep water. [593]

She understood now. [596] The promise her grandmother had left wasn't an explanation—it was an invitation to witness the universe remembering itself. [614]

Korin placed the seventeenth stone. [619]

The pattern completed. [622]

The eels sang mathematics into the frictionless night, and she finally understood the sacred geometry of letting go. [640]
