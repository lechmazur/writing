The freight guard had not dreamed in seven years, not since the last forest burned and the smoke clouds learned to hold their shape. [26] She rode the night rails through territories that existed in superposition, her cargo cars loaded with seeds that hummed in frequencies only the desperate could hear. [54] The company called her Maren, though names meant less now that reality had begun to fracture like old glass. [73]

Tonight's destination glowed on the horizon—a dune that bloomed with bioluminescent flowers, their petals opening and closing in rhythm with waves no ocean had made. [100] The dune existed occasionally everywhere, appearing in twelve locations simultaneously until someone observed it directly, collapsing its probability into singular presence. [121] Maren had learned to approach it with her eyes half-closed, preserving its quantum multiplicity as long as possible. [139]

In her guardhouse, bolted between freight cars, the chess clock sat frozen at midnight on both sides. [156] She'd found it in the divergent archive—that impossible library where every book contained all the stories it might have told, every page splitting into infinite variations. [181] The archive's curator had given her the clock as payment for a delivery, saying only: "Time can be convinced to wait, if you charm it properly." [207]

Maren understood charm not as magic but as persuasion, the gentle coaxing of wave functions toward desired outcomes. [225] She'd learned to speak to probability itself, to cultivate the sparks in the unlit corners where new realities waited to be born. [248] Each seed she transported carried potential futures—forests that might rise from ash, ecosystems that could breathe in the scorched air the old world had left behind. [275]

The train slowed as it approached the glowing dune, and Maren stepped onto the observation platform. [291] The flowers sang their fractured lullaby, each bloom holding a different note until the whole dune harmonized in broken beauty. [310] She opened the cargo doors and began the charm, her voice joining the flowers, her words weaving through wave functions like fingers through tall grass. [333]

"Grow in the probable places," she sang softly. [342] "Root in the spaces between what is and what could be." [354]

The seeds responded, lifting from their containers on currents of pure potential. [367] They scattered across the dune, each one seeking its own superposition, its own set of futures to inhabit. [386] Some would become trees; others would become the memory of trees, which in this new world amounted to the same thing. [408]

A figure approached from the dune's crest—another traveler, or perhaps the same traveler from twelve different timelines, their outline shimmering with multiplicity. [430] They carried a book from the divergent archive, pages fluttering though no wind blew. [444]

"The last forest burns still," they said, their voice layered with echoes. [457] "In some timelines, it never stops burning." [465]

"Then we cultivate new sparks," Maren replied, gesturing to the seeds taking root in the luminous sand. [483] "We charm probability toward growth." [489]

The figure nodded and handed her the book. [498] Inside, she found a single entry written in ink that shifted between past and future tense: "The dreamless freight guard travels the rails of collapsed possibility, carrying futures in her freight cars. [530] Where she passes, the burned world remembers how to hope." [541]

Maren closed the book and tucked it beside the frozen chess clock. [553] Time would wait; it always did when properly convinced. [563] The seeds were already sprouting, their roots diving through multiple realities at once, their shoots reaching toward stars that existed in some timelines and not in others. [591]

She returned to the guardhouse as the train began to move again, leaving the glowing dune to bloom in all its occasional locations simultaneously. [614] Tomorrow she would deliver more seeds to another impossible place. [626] Tomorrow the unlit corners would spark again. [634]

In seven years, she had not dreamed, but the world dreamed through her now—fractured, multiple, and stubbornly alive. [653] The chess clock ticked once, moved one second past midnight, then froze again. [667]

Time could be charmed. [671]

Reality could be cultivated. [675]

Even the dreamless could carry hope through the quantum dark. [686]
