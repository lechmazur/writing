The medium lived in a houseboat anchored deep within the mangrove labyrinth, where the roots twisted like arthritic fingers and the spirits sang their endless, wordless songs. [28] She was called Meera, though few knew her name—most who sought her out called her nothing at all, too desperate to bother with names. [53] They came seeking messages from the dead, but Meera dealt in something far more dangerous: she helped people find moments they'd already lived through, the inflection points where everything changed. [81]

Tonight's client clutched a shoebox filled with unsent letters, pages yellowed and creased from repeated folding and unfolding. [98] "I never apologized," the woman said, her voice breaking on the words. [110] "My sister died before I could tell her I was wrong." [122]

Meera studied the woman's grief-hollowed face with fierce tenderness, recognizing the particular anguish of words trapped in the throat forever. [141] She'd seen it countless times—people who lived in that liminal space where an apology waits unspoken, suspended between pride and regret. [162]

"I can't bring her back," Meera said, her voice cryptic as always, layered with meanings within meanings. [179] "But I can help you find the moment before deciding—the instant when you still had the choice to speak." [198]

She reached for the gargoyle's rainspout shard she kept wrapped in silk, a jagged piece of carved stone that had fallen from a cathedral during a storm three hundred years ago. [227] The shard had its own history of catching tears—rain, yes, but also the grief of penitents who'd looked up at it while confessing sins. [251] Under moonlight, it healed things, knitting together not flesh but fractured timelines, opening doorways to moments thought lost. [269]

The moon was rising now, full and bright, filtering through the mangrove canopy. [282] Silver light touched the shard, and it began to warm in Meera's palm. [296] The singing spirits grew louder, their voices climbing in pitch and complexity, weaving harmonies that made the air shimmer. [313]

"Read one," Meera instructed, nodding toward the box. [322]

The woman's hands trembled as she unfolded a letter. [332] Her voice shook as she read aloud: "Dear Sarah, I should have listened when you told me about Marcus. [350] You were trying to protect me, and I called you jealous. [362] I'm sorry. [365] I'm so sorry." [369]

The words hung in the humid air. [376] Meera held the moonlit shard up to the houseboat's window, where condensation had already begun to form on the glass. [395] She pressed the stone's jagged edge against the moisture, dragging it through the droplets deliberately, carving words that weren't words—symbols that would evoke what needed to surface. [420]

The singing spirits crescendoed, and suddenly messages began appearing in the condensation, writing themselves in backwards script: *sister*, *forgive*, *knew*, *loved*. [439]

"She's here?" [442] the woman whispered. [445]

"No," Meera said gently. [449] "You are. [452] You're finding your way back to that afternoon, three days before the accident. [466] You're sitting in your kitchen. [472] Your phone is on the counter. [478] Her number is still in it. [485] You're angry, but underneath the anger, you know she was right." [497]

The woman closed her eyes, tears streaming down her face. [507] "I remember," she breathed. [511] "I almost called." [514]

"That's the moment," Meera said. [519] "That's where you can decide differently—not in reality, but in understanding. [531] You can send the letter now, not to her mailbox, but to that version of yourself who still had time." [551]

The woman opened her eyes, and something in them had shifted—still grief-stricken, but no longer trapped. [567] She took the shard from Meera's hand, pressed it against her own chest, and felt the moonlight's healing work through it, knitting together the broken places where words should have lived. [595]

"Thank you," she whispered. [599]

Meera watched her leave, the houseboat rocking gently as the mangrove spirits sang their ancient, knowing songs. [616] She touched the condensation messages on the window, already fading, and thought of all the unsent letters in the world—all the apologies waiting in the space between pride and love. [645]

Tomorrow, someone else would come. [650] Tomorrow, she would help them find their moment again. [660]

Tonight, though, she sat in the moonlight and let the fierce tenderness of her calling wash over her like rain. [680]
