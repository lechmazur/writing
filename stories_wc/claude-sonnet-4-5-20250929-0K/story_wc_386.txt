The shrine glowed amber in the glacier's heart, candles flickering against walls of ancient ice that held bones of forgotten ships. [23] Maya knelt before the altar, her diving suit still damp from the morning's descent, and placed the melted snow globe among the offerings. [48] Inside its warped glass, a miniature lighthouse listed at an impossible angle, suspended in clouded water that would never settle. [69]

She had pulled it from the Katharina three hundred feet below, where the freighter had rested for sixty years. [90] The dead gathered thick around that wreck, their whispers rising through the dark water like strings of pearls. [109] Most wreck-divers ignored such things, but Maya had learned long ago that the drowned rarely lied. [126]

Tonight, she would expose the truth they'd been trying to tell her. [138]

The method had come to her gradually, pieced together from years of listening. [152] The drowned didn't speak directly—their messages arrived obliquely, woven through the dreams of strangers who'd never touched saltwater. [171] Maya had tracked seventeen such dreamers over three months, analyzing the cameo appearances of a woman in a red coat who appeared at the edges of their sleep. [199] Always the same woman, always reaching toward something just out of frame. [212]

The candles guttered as Maya closed her eyes. [221] The ice walls of the shrine seemed to breathe around her, this sacred space she'd carved over winter months, one careful cut at a time. [247] Here, the boundaries thinned. [251] Here, windows of connection opened between the living and the lost. [263]

The woman in the red coat materialized slowly, her form borrowed starlight given shape. [277] She looked younger than Maya expected, perhaps thirty, with salt-crusted hair and eyes that held the Atlantic's grey. [296]

"Katherine," Maya said softly, naming her at last. [305] "The ship was yours." [310]

The ghost's smile carried profound sadness. [316] "My father's. [319] I convinced him to let me navigate that night." [329] Her voice arrived not as sound but as knowing, settling into Maya's mind like snow. [345]

"The dreamers see you reaching," Maya prompted. [353] "What are you trying to salvage?" [360]

Katherine's form drifted toward the melted snow globe. [369] "My daughter was three. [374] I bought this for her in Halifax—we were to return home the next week." [390] The ghost's transparency deepened. [395] "When the storm came, when we struck the rocks, I held it in my pocket. [411] Thought somehow it would reach her. [418] Thought she might know I was thinking of her as the water rose." [433]

Maya understood the weight of such small objects, how they carried entire oceans of love. [449] She'd seen it before, this desperate arithmetic of the drowning—choosing what matters in those final moments. [466]

"Your daughter," Maya said carefully, weaving truth as gently as she could. [479] "I found her. [483] Evelyn Morris, eighty-four now, living in a nursing home in Halifax." [496]

The ghost's form brightened, candles flaring in response. [505]

"She never knew what happened to you," Maya continued. [515] "The Katharina simply vanished. [520] She spent her life wondering if you'd abandoned her, if something she'd done had driven you away." [539]

Katherine's anguish rippled through the shrine, frost spreading across the walls. [551] "No. [553] Never. [555] I would have given anything—" [561]

"I know," Maya said. [566] "That's why I'm here. [572] That's why I dive into the wrecks and carve shrines in ice and track dreams across continents." [590] She lifted the ruined snow globe. [597] "Tomorrow, I drive to Halifax. [603] I give Evelyn this, and I tell her what you told me." [617] 

The ghost reached toward Maya's hands, toward the globe, her fingers passing through both. [632] "Tell her it was in my pocket," Katherine whispered. [643] "Tell her she was my last thought, my only thought." [654]

"I will," Maya promised. [659]

As Katherine faded, dissolving into borrowed light returning to distant stars, Maya felt the familiar ache of such meetings. [679] She salvaged stories from the wreckage, retrieved love from the deep places, built windows so the drowned could finally speak. [700]

In the candle-lit shrine, surrounded by ancient ice and older sorrows, Maya wrapped the melted snow globe in cloth and prepared to surface. [725] Above, dawn would be breaking. [731] Above, an old woman waited without knowing she was waiting. [743]

Maya extinguished the candles one by one, leaving only darkness and ice and the pure, cold knowledge that some things survive even drowning. [768]
