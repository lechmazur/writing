The cobalt observatory stood sentinel against the autumn wind, its copper dome tarnished to green centuries ago. [17] Inside, Mirelle bent over her embroidery frame, needle pulling silver thread through dark velvet in patterns that would have meant nothing to most observers. [39] She was recording star positions, trade routes, political alliances—a galaxy chart disguised as decorative nonsense. [54]

"Still playing with your stitchery, old woman?" [61] Commander Vas paused at her workstation, smirking. [68] She cackled obligingly, holding up a wildly asymmetric constellation that made him shake his head. [83] "Madness," he muttered, moving toward the observation deck. [91]

Mirelle waited until his footsteps faded before allowing herself a thin smile. [103] Her reputation as the observatory's eccentric embroiderer protected her better than any armor. [116] When you disguised wisdom as foolishness, people stopped asking dangerous questions. [127]

She had been listening for three months now, not to the stars but to the unheard stories trapped in echoed silence between official declarations. [151] The observatory employed forty-three astronomers, technicians, and military personnel. [160] Each conversation she overheard, each casual complaint or cryptic meeting, became another thread in her tapestry. [176]

The flame from the eternal candle flickered in its bronze housing beside her frame. [190] Tradition demanded it burn continuously since the observatory's founding, a navigational beacon synchronized to the planet's rotation. [206] But Mirelle had noticed something peculiar six weeks ago—brief moments when the flame guttered, always at dawn, always preceding unusual military movements. [228]

Today marked the final day before the coup, though only a handful knew it. [242] Mirelle was not supposed to be among them. [250]

She pulled her needle through again, charting what she called adjacent possibilities—the futures that might unfold depending on whose conspiracy succeeded. [270] General Korthan's faction wanted to preserve the scientific autonomy of observatories. [282] Commander Vas served interests that would militarize all astronomical knowledge. [292] A third group, nameless yet, seemed to be manipulating both sides. [303]

The eternal flame dimmed. [307] Dawn, precisely on schedule. [311]

Mirelle set down her embroidery and shuffled to the southern window, playing her role of confused elderly artist seeking better light. [331] Below, in the cobalt-shadowed courtyard, three supply trucks arrived. [341] The drivers wore observatory uniforms but moved with military precision. [351]

So it would be today. [356]

She returned to her frame and began working faster, synchronizing her stitches with the pattern she had slowly decoded over months. [376] The eternal flame's disruptions weren't random—they aligned with encrypted communications. [387] Someone was using the ancient tradition as a carrier signal, modulating the gas flow to transmit binary messages. [405]

Her needle flew through velvet, silver thread catching candlelight. [414] She embroidered the message she had finally deciphered: coordinates, times, but not for the military building everyone expected. [432] The real target was the Archive Vault beneath the observatory itself, where original star charts documented anomalies that contradicted official cosmology. [452]

The conspirators—whichever faction ultimately controlled them—wanted to rewrite not just political power but astronomical history. [467]

Footsteps echoed in the corridor. [472] Multiple sets, urgent. [475]

Mirelle's gnarled fingers worked faster, completing the final constellation. [484] She had no authority, no weapons, no allies who would believe an old embroiderer. [498] But she had documented everything through adjacent possibilities, showing three branching futures in silver thread. [513] The chart would mean nothing to soldiers searching for weapons or manifestos. [526]

But to the right observer—someone who understood that wisdom often dressed in motley—her embroidery contained a complete intelligence report. [545]

She knotted off the final thread as boots thundered closer. [556] With trembling hands that might have been genuine or performance, she lifted the frame and shuffled toward the astronomical library, where her friend Tomas catalogued ancient observations. [581]

The eternal flame brightened again as dawn passed, its secret message complete. [593]

Behind her, Commander Vas's voice echoed through cobalt corridors, shouting orders. [604]

Mirelle clutched her embroidery closer, one old woman listening to the unheard stories written in flames and stars and the silent spaces between official truths. [630]

The autumn wind howled against ancient walls as history prepared to bend. [642]

She knocked softly at the library door, and in the echoed silence before it opened, whispered her prayer to the pattern: "Let someone understand." [668]
