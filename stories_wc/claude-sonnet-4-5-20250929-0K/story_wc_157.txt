The entomologist's greenhouse had become something else entirely in the years after the Thought Taxation Act passed. [17] Dr. Elias Crane, charming rogue scholar with a doctorate in dead languages and a warrant for unpaid cognitive assessments, stood among the humid rows of chrysanthemums and watched the butterflies trace their coded patterns. [50] He shook the gourd rattle seed—a hollowed vessel filled with peppercorns—three times, the signal that meant *sanctuary compromised*. [68]

"They're auditing community gardens now," whispered Mara, ducking through the elephant ear leaves. [81] Her hands were still dirty from the message patterns she'd planted that morning: rows of radishes and carrots arranged in the old Phoenician alphabet, spelling out meeting coordinates only their secret language club could decipher. [114]

Elias responded in his candidly cryptic manner, speaking truths wrapped in deliberate obscurity. [127] "The tax collectors count your thoughts like coins, but they can't tax what they can't read, and they can't read what doesn't exist in their databases." [153] He gestured to the butterflies. [158] "The entomologist left us more than insects when she disappeared." [168]

The greenhouse was their third meeting place this month. [177] Every time the Neural Revenue Service detected unusual brain activity patterns—the kind that suggested unauthorized collaboration or, worse, organized resistance—the club had to warp their location, bending through the city's forgotten spaces like light through flawed glass. [213] Community gardens had been their recruitment grounds, places where they could join legitimately, plant vegetables that screamed silent defiance in arrangements of extinct scripts. [233]

"How many tonight?" [236] Elias asked. [238]

"Seventeen confirmed. [240] Maybe more." [242] Mara pulled out a notebook written entirely in Linear A, an undeciphered Bronze Age script that made it functionally invisible to the AI scanners. [265] "The problem is, every time we teach someone the languages, every time they start thinking in Sumerian or Etruscan or Old Church Slavonic, their thought signature warps. [289] The algorithms notice the deviation." [294]

Elias smiled, that roguish expression that had talked him out of three arrests and into a dozen hearts. [312] "That's not a problem. [316] That's the point." [319]

He led her deeper into the greenhouse, where the late entomologist's most precious specimens lived. [334] Morpho butterflies, their wings iridescent blue, clustered on a cork board arranged in patterns. [349] "Dr. Sato didn't just study insects. [355] She studied communication systems that preceded human language. [363] Watch." [364]

He shook the gourd rattle seed again, a different rhythm. [375] The butterflies lifted as one, swirling in a vortex that seemed to warp the very air, their wing patterns creating a visual language of colors and angles. [402]

"She taught them?" [405] Mara breathed. [407]

"She joined them," Elias corrected. [412] "Became part of their communication network. [418] Left us the method before the taxmen came for her." [428]

The convergence was beginning—club members slipping through the greenhouse door in ones and twos, each carrying their own gourd rattles, their minds full of conjugations and declensions from languages dead for millennia. [458] The chaos of their arrival warped into strange order as they formed their circle, this community garden of the mind where they planted seeds of untaxable thought. [485]

Elias raised his gourd rattle. [490] "They want to count our thoughts, measure our defiance, tax our very consciousness. [503] So we stand guard over our own sparks. [512] We think in languages their machines can't parse. [521] We plant messages in arrangements they can't see. [530] We warp ourselves into shapes that don't fit their boxes." [541]

The butterflies swirled around them now, dozens of members speaking in Hittite and Akkadian and Minoan, their voices a converging chaos that somehow harmonized. [563] In the humid air of the greenhouse, surrounded by the specimens of a disappeared scientist, they were untaxable. [581] Here, in this moment, their thoughts belonged only to themselves. [591]

Elias shook the gourd rattle one final time. [600] The sound meant *begin*. [604]

And in seventeen minds, ancient languages bloomed like defiant flowers, their roots sinking deep into consciousness where no auditor could ever reach. [626]
