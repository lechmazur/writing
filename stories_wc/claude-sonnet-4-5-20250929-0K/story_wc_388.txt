The orchard shouldn't have existed, but Vera had learned that impossibility was just another hypothesis waiting to be tested. [19] She stood among the gnarled apple trees, their fruit luminous against the gray wasteland sky, while radioactive dust settled on her shoulders like poisoned snow. [43] The trees had been thriving here for three years—ever since the liquidation of the old government's agricultural projects—and locals whispered about curses and miracles. [67] Vera dealt in neither. [71]

She was a conspiracy debunker by trade and obsession, someone who excavated truth from the comfortable lies people told themselves to make the world bearable. [97] The orchard attracted every doomsday prophet and radiation cultist within a hundred miles, all spinning stories about why these trees flourished when everything else had turned to ash. [125]

The latest theory involved a diamond. [131]

Vera knelt beside the oldest tree, examining the soil with her sharply observant eye. [145] Fragments of paper lay scattered near the roots, their edges browned and brittle. [158] Someone had shredded documents here recently, perhaps trying to hide something. [169] She began collecting the pieces, her fingers working methodically despite the Geiger counter clicking steadily at her hip. [186]

The locals claimed a flawed diamond lay buried somewhere in the orchard, a stone supposedly cursed by pre-liquidation scientists who'd experimented with it in their weapons program. [211] According to the myth, the diamond's imperfection created a hidden stillpoint—a pocket of space where radiation couldn't penetrate, where life could take root again. [234] Beautiful nonsense, Vera thought, but she'd learned to intuit the kernels of truth buried in even the most baroque fabrications. [253]

She spread the shredded paper fragments on a flat stone, beginning the painstaking work of reassembling them. [269] The wind howled, threatening to scatter her evidence, but she'd brought clips and weights. [283] Pattern recognition was her gift; she could see connections others missed. [294]

After an hour, words emerged: "Project Stillpoint... containment failure... diamond matrix... burial coordinates..." [307]

Vera's pulse quickened. [310] Not a curse, then—an accident. [316] She continued working, her hands steady as the pieces formed a coherent narrative. [329] The pre-liquidation government had indeed experimented with diamonds, using their crystalline structure to create radiation shields. [344] One prototype had been flawed, its atomic lattice irregular, but instead of failing completely, it had created something unexpected: a stable zone of normalcy, a stillpoint where the usual laws of radioactive decay simply paused. [377]

They'd buried it here, in what was then a condemned wasteland, never expecting anything to grow. [393]

But the trees had found it. [399] Their roots had reached down through poisoned soil to that pocket of stability, drawing sustenance from the one place where the earth remembered what life tasted like. [426]

Vera reassembled the final fragments, revealing coordinates. [433] She pulled out her surveying tools and began taking measurements, triangulating from the landmarks mentioned in the documents. [450] The hidden stillpoint would be approximately six feet down, directly beneath where she'd found the shredded letters. [466]

Someone had known. [469] Someone had tried to destroy the evidence, probably one of the former government scientists who'd survived the liquidation and now lived anonymously among the orchard's devotees. [494] They'd wanted the miracle to remain mysterious, the truth buried beneath comfortable mysticism. [507]

Vera began to dig. [511]

The soil came away easily, still loose from whoever had been here before. [524] At four feet down, her shovel struck something hard. [534] She cleared the dirt carefully, revealing a steel container about the size of a shoebox. [549] Inside, cushioned in lead-lined foam, sat a diamond the size of a walnut. [563]

It was cloudy, riddled with dark inclusions that caught the fading light. [575] Flawed, yes, but functioning. [579] She could feel it somehow—not mystically, but as an absence of the constant low-grade nausea that permeated the wasteland. [598] Here, in this small sphere of influence, the world was clean. [609]

Vera carefully reburied the diamond and packed the soil down firmly. [620] She would publish her findings, strip away the curse narrative, explain the science. [633] But she would also ensure the coordinates remained vague, the diamond's exact location protected. [647]

Some truths needed excavating. [651] Others needed guardians. [654]

She walked back through the thriving orchard, leaving the comfortable lies behind but carrying something more valuable: an uncomfortable truth that might let others keep hoping. [679] The trees would continue growing, and people could believe what they needed to believe. [693]

Vera had debunked the curse, but she'd leave the miracle intact. [705]
