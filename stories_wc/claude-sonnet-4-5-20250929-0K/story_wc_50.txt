The locksmith had lived through three winters in the marble cavern before he understood what the timer mechanism was counting. [20]

He'd found it half-buried in calcite deposits near the eastern passage, its brass gears frozen mid-rotation, springs burst from corrosion. [39] Most would have seen junk. [44] Marcus saw a question that needed answering. [51]

The wounded season had arrived early that year—a blight that withered the valley's crops and drove survivors into the caves. [70] Marcus had descended with the others, seeking shelter in the vast network of marble halls where underground streams still ran clean. [91] But while others built fires and rationed supplies, he found himself drawn to the periphery of their settlement, to places where torchlight barely reached. [113]

The cavern's walls held secrets in their surfaces. [121] Marcus noticed this during his third sleepless night, watching how moonlight filtering through fissures played across the polished stone. [139] The reflections shifted as hours passed, creating patterns that repeated with astronomical precision. [152] He began mapping these angles, sketching them on scraped leather with charcoal. [164]

The broken timer mechanism became his obsession. [171] He would sit for hours studying its corroded innards, trying to reverse-engineer its purpose from the relationship between its components. [191] Why would someone build a counting device here, deep underground? [201] The answer lay in reflection. [206]

At different times of day, light entered the cavern through specific channels in the rock overhead. [222] Marcus documented each beam's trajectory, measuring angles against the marble's mirror-like finish. [235] What he discovered made his pulse quicken: the patterns weren't random. [246] They were echoes—temporal echoes. [251]

The marble preserved something of what it had witnessed. [260] Not images exactly, but impressions. [265] Studying the reflection angles revealed shadows of movements long past, ghostly repetitions of people who had walked these halls centuries ago. [285] The timer mechanism, he realized, had been designed to harvest these echoes. [298]

Marcus threw himself into reconstruction. [303] Using scraps of metal from abandoned tools, he fabricated new gears, teaching himself the language of springs and escapements. [322] His fingers, trained to understand the secret anatomy of locks, adapted quickly to these smaller, more delicate mechanisms. [340]

The other survivors thought him mad, spending the lull of their wounded season on such impractical work. [357] They focused on survival—rationing, hunting, waiting for the blight to pass. [369] But Marcus understood something they didn't: wonder itself was a resource that needed storing. [383]

"To store wonder in the cellar of reason, for later," he muttered, adjusting a hairspring. [398] "When this is over, we'll need more than food." [408]

He remained peripherally focused on the settlement's daily dramas—the arguments over supplies, the sickness that claimed old Chen, the birth of the Martov twins. [432] These mattered, but they weren't his contribution. [440] His gift would be different. [445]

On the season's coldest night, Marcus completed the timer's restoration. [456] He wound it carefully and placed it at the cavern's geometric center, where six passages converged and moonlight pooled. [475]

The mechanism ticked. [478] Clicked. [479] Began its count. [482]

And the marble walls responded. [487]

Reflections bloomed across the stone like flowers opening—not just light, but captured moments. [501] Marcus saw merchants from some ancient civilization spreading goods on these same floors. [515] He saw children playing a game involving painted stones. [525] He saw lovers meeting in shadow, and scholars consulting star charts, and miners discovering the beauty they'd exposed. [544]

The echoes didn't speak, but they sang with meaning. [553] Here was proof that others had endured their own wounded seasons, had sheltered in these depths, had continued. [571]

Marcus called the survivors to witness. [577] They came reluctantly at first, then stood transfixed as the timer's steady rhythm conjured ghosts of resilience from the stone. [597]

"For later," Marcus said softly, watching reflected wonder illuminate their faces. [608] "When we forget how to hope, we can return here. [619] The marble remembers." [622]

The mechanism ticked on, harvesting echoes through the long wait for spring. [635]
