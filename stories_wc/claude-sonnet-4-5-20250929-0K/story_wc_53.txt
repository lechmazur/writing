The carousel had stopped three days ago, or perhaps three years—Mira could no longer trust her memory's chronology. [19] She stood on the crystal platform jutting over the kinetic lagoon, watching water spiral upward in defiance of gravity, forming columns that touched the clouds and dissolved into mist. [46] Time moved differently here, above the world, where the carousel's music had once kept everything synchronized. [63]

She fingered the disposable camera wheel in her pocket, the only object she'd scavenged from the carousel's debris field. [82] The plastic teeth were broken, the film long exposed, but she'd collected it anyway—as she collected everything now. [100] Fragments. [101] Pieces. [102] Words floating on the wind. [107]

"She wanted to be a cartographer of impossible places," someone had whispered yesterday, or tomorrow. [122] Mira had caught the phrase mid-air, added it to her collection. [134] She didn't know who they'd been discussing, but she wore the story anyway, trying it on like a coat. [152]

Her own ambitions had eroded slowly, like the stone pillars surrounding the lagoon. [165] Once, she'd had a name for what she wanted. [175] Once, she'd climbed to this realm with purpose burning in her chest. [188] Now she scavenged the conversations of travelers passing through, piecing together narratives that might explain why she remained. [206]

The kinetic lagoon churned its fractured stillness—violent and calm simultaneously, moving and frozen. [220] Droplets hung suspended between up and down, catching light that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. [237] The carousel's absence had broken something fundamental in the physics here. [248] Or maybe it had always been broken, and the music had simply masked it. [262]

"He stayed because he couldn't face what he'd become," another voice drifted past, plucked from a group descending the cloud-stairs. [281] Mira grabbed this fragment too, pressed it into her mental archive. [292] Was that her story? [296] She couldn't remember. [299]

She'd seen her ghost this morning—or was it her reflection? [310]—standing on the opposite platform, wearing the face she'd had before. [322] Before the carousel, before the erosion. [329] The ghost had beckoned, but Mira hadn't known whether it was summoning or warning. [343]

This was why she remained: to negotiate with that specter of her former self. [357] To explain why the resolute girl who'd climbed here had become this fractured thing, this collector of other people's purposes. [376]

She pulled out the camera wheel, held it to the light. [387] Through its broken center, she could see the ghost materializing again on the far platform. [402] Closer now. [404] Inevitable. [405]

"She didn't fail," someone had told their companion last week, the words drifting across the lagoon. [421] "She just forgot what success looked like." [428]

Mira had collected that fragment with trembling hands. [436]

The ghost raised its hand. [441] Mira raised hers. [444] The camera wheel spun between her fingers, its broken teeth catching on her skin. [458] Film that would never develop. [463] Images that would never exist. [468] Ambitions that would never—[472]

Regret tasted like cloud-mist: substantial enough to choke on, insubstantial enough to question whether it existed at all. [490]

She'd been so certain when she arrived. [497] The carousel had promised transformation, elevation, purpose. [504] She'd paid the price, climbed the impossible stairs, stood in the kinetic lagoon's spray and declared herself ready. [522]

Then the carousel had stopped, and she'd discovered that transformation without direction was just disintegration. [537]

The ghost stepped onto the water. [543] The lagoon held it, or didn't—physics meant nothing here anymore. [555] It walked across the spinning columns, through the suspended droplets, wearing purpose like armor. [569]

"I don't know how to go back," Mira said to herself, or to her ghost, or to the fragments she'd collected. [589]

But the ghost smiled, held out its hand, and whispered something new—not a fragment stolen from strangers, but a memory from before the erosion: "You were never meant to go back." [617]

The camera wheel fell from Mira's fingers, tumbled into the lagoon's impossible depths. [630]

She took the ghost's hand. [635]

Above them, below them, around them, the kinetic lagoon spun its fractured stillness, and somewhere in the distance, she thought she heard music beginning again. [659] Or perhaps it had never stopped. [665] Perhaps she'd simply forgotten how to listen. [672]

Time collapsed. [674] The ghost dissolved into her, or she into it, and Mira—resolute again, finally, terribly—understood that negotiation had never been the answer. [695]

Acceptance was. [697]

The lagoon stilled its spinning, just for a moment, holding its breath. [710]

Then everything began to move. [716]
