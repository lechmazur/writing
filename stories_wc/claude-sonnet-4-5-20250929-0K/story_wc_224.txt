The mercury-glass seer stood at the heart of the labyrinthine bookstore, her reflective skin catching fragments of candlelight that spiraled through the mountain's hollowed corridors. [27] She had lived here since remembering became painful, when her visions began to substitute reality nightly, replacing the waking world with prophecies that felt more true than truth itself. [54] The bookstore had grown around her over decades, or perhaps centuries—time moved strangely in mountains that breathed paper and ink. [74]

Tonight, she held the lost language stone between her palms, its surface warm and inscribed with symbols no scholar could translate. [94] She had discovered it wedged between volumes in the Philosophy wing, three levels down from the summit, buried beneath dust that tasted of forgotten civilizations. [117] The stone hummed against her skin, and she understood: it was calling her to remember what she had deliberately chosen to bury. [139]

Her talents had always frightened her. [145] As a child, before the mercury transfiguration, she could read destinies in ordinary things—the way steam rose from soup, how shadows fell across doorways. [169] Her parents had feared her gift, called it unnatural, and so she had learned to hide it deep within herself, to seed doubt over certainty, to pretend blindness when visions came. [198] But buried talents never truly die; they transform into something else, something that erupts when you least expect it. [217]

The stone's warmth intensified. [221] She closed her eyes and felt the familiar displacement begin, that nightly substitution where prophecy overwrote reality. [239] But this time was different. [244] This time, she didn't resist. [249]

The vision came via the texture of a feather—a raven's feather that materialized in her hand, its barbs speaking in the lost language carved into the stone. [274] She understood now: the stone wasn't teaching her to read an ancient script. [288] It was teaching her to read herself. [295]

The feather's texture told stories her mercury-glass fingers could decipher: each microscopic ridge held a memory she'd suppressed, each shaft a truth she'd denied. [317] She saw herself as she'd once been, a young girl who could see the hidden thunder in people's hearts—the rage, the love, the desperate hope they concealed beneath ordinary words. [346] She saw why she'd fled to this mountain, why she'd chosen a form that reflected the world rather than looked directly at it. [370]

She had been trying to understand the shape of home. [380]

Not the physical structure where she'd grown up, that narrow house with its narrow minds, but the deeper architecture of belonging. [401] What made a place yours? [406] What made you fit within walls that seemed built to exclude you? [419]

The bookstore had given her an answer, but incomplete. [428] Yes, she'd built a sanctuary here, a labyrinth vast enough to contain all her strangeness. [443] But she'd done it by substituting her real self for reflections, living nightly in visions rather than in flesh. [462] She'd buried her talents so deep they'd become the mountain itself—solid, immovable, separate from the world below. [481]

The lost language stone grew hot enough to burn. [490] The feather in her other hand began to smoke. [499]

She made her choice. [503]

With her mercury-glass hands, she pressed the stone against her chest, felt it sink into her reflective surface like a seed entering soil. [526] The pain was exquisite—remembering always was—but this time she didn't substitute vision for reality. [541] She let both exist simultaneously. [546]

The feather's texture changed, became soft, became real. [554] New symbols appeared on the stone now embedded in her chest, and these she could read perfectly: they spelled her true name, the one she'd buried when burial seemed safer than blooming. [585]

Thunder rolled through the mountain's corridors, no longer hidden. [594]

She opened her eyes to find the labyrinth transformed. [603] The books had rearranged themselves into new configurations, passages opening where walls had stood. [617] The mountain bookstore was still vast, still labyrinthine, but now it felt less like a hiding place and more like a home—a shape that finally fit the contours of who she'd always been. [650]

She walked toward the nearest window, where dawn light was beginning to seed itself across the valley below. [668] Her mercury-glass surface caught the rising sun and didn't just reflect it—she refracted it into colors that had no names in any known language. [693]

This too was a kind of vision. [700]

This too was a kind of truth. [707]

And for the first time since remembering became painful, she felt the shape of home settle around her like a feather's gentle weight. [729]
