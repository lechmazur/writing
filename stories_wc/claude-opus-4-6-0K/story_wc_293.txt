The hitchhiker had been in the passenger seat for eleven miles, humming a melody that Cora recognized from the bridges she used to play on, and then he wasn't. [30]

She pulled into the mountain scenic pullout because her hands were shaking too badly to steer. [46] The Blue Ridge unfolded below in smoke-blue layers, indifferent to the impossible thing that had just happened in her truck. [65] One moment the man had been there -- denim jacket, white beard, a voice like weathered cedar -- and the next, the seat was empty, the seatbelt still clasped around nothing. [93]

Cora was a bridge-song fiddler by trade, which meant she'd spent twenty years standing on spans of steel and stone, drawing out tunes she believed the architecture wanted to sing. [122] Asheville's pedestrian bridge, the old truss over the French Broad, the footbridge in Linville -- she knew them like she knew the lines in her palms. [147] She was dynamically observant by necessity: you had to read wind, crowd mood, the micro-tensions of cable and wood, to play a bridge right. [170] So when the hitchhiker vanished, she didn't scream. [178] She catalogued. [180]

She catalogued the warmth still pressed into the vinyl seat. [190] She catalogued the faint chemical smell, sharp and antique, like ether and silver. [202] And she catalogued the object he'd left behind on the dashboard: a shard of glass no bigger than a playing card, dark amber, its surface carrying a ghostly image. [230]

A wet-plate collodion glass flake. [236] She'd seen them in museum cases -- fragments of the oldest photographic negatives, coated in that volatile silver-iodide emulsion Civil War photographers once used to fix a single moment before it dissolved. [263] This one showed a woman standing on a bridge with a fiddle under her chin. [277] The woman was Cora. [281]

But the bridge in the image was one she had never played. [293] She held the glass to the failing light and studied the scene: a suspension bridge over a gorge she didn't recognize, wrapped in construction scaffold, the kind sheathed in white plastic that snaps and flutters in high wind. [328] Behind the scaffold wrap, partially visible through a tear, someone had painted symbols -- numbers, arrows, coordinates. [344] A secret mapped by scaffold wrap flutters, readable only when the wind pulled the sheeting aside at exactly the right angle. [362]

She began to recount every word the hitchhiker had spoken. [372] He'd asked her why she stopped playing. [379] She'd told him the truth: after the fire that took her cabin, her instruments, and sixteen years of recordings, she'd told herself never. [399] Never again. [401] The word had calcified inside her likeite in a pipe, stopping the flow of everything she'd once been. [418]

He'd said, "Never is just a photograph that hasn't finished developing." [428]

Now she turned the glass flake over and saw, scratched into the collodion with a needle-fine instrument, a set of GPS coordinates. [449] The image of herself on that unknown bridge, the coordinates, the map hidden behind scaffold plastic -- it was all one message, fragmented across media and time, a kind of pixelated amnesty. [478] Not forgiveness delivered whole and clean, but broken into shards you had to assemble yourself, each piece granting partial release from the sentence you'd imposed on your own life. [505] Pixel by pixel, fragment by fragment, the picture resolved: you were allowed to begin again. [519]

She sat in the pullout as the sky turned the color of a struck match. [533] A semi roared past and the truck rocked on its springs. [544] She held the glass to the sunset and the ghostly image of herself blazed into clarity -- chin lifted, bow raised, alive with a luminous disbelief that Cora recognized because she was wearing it now, that expression of someone witnessing their own resurrection and not quite trusting it. [590]

The coordinates pointed to a place in Tennessee, near a gorge she'd once driven past without stopping. [607] There would be a bridge there, wrapped in scaffold, carrying a secret in its fluttering skin. [622] She didn't know who the hitchhiker had been -- ghost, hallucination, or some kinder physics she lacked vocabulary for. [639] She knew only that he'd left her the raw materials, and that her motivation was ancient and aching and simple: to sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never." [664]

Cora set the glass flake on the dashboard, turned the key, and pulled back onto the mountain road. [681] Somewhere ahead, a bridge was waiting to be played. [691] The fiddle case behind her seat hummed faintly with the engine's vibration, as if the strings inside already knew the song. [712]
