The pirate market beneath Creel Pier never truly slept, but it did hold its breath. [16]

Della Cane knew the rhythm of this place the way she knew her father's stillhouse — by the silences between sounds. [36] She was a moonshine runner's daughter, raised on the understanding that what you didn't say kept you alive longer than what you did. [56] Tonight she moved through the sagging labyrinth of stalls and rope-hung lanterns with an antique watch fob clutched in her left hand, its chain cold against her wrist, its face cracked but still ticking. [86] It had belonged to her father before the revenuers took him, and before that to his mother, and before that to someone whose name the family had agreed to forget. [112]

The market sprawled in the wet dark beneath the rotting pier like a wound that had learned to sell things. [130] Barnacled posts held up a ceiling of warped planks, and between them hung tarps and fishing nets converted into walls for vendor stalls. [152] You could buy falsified deeds, powdered coral said to cure blindness, ammunition older than the republic. [166] The air tasted of brine and kerosene and the particular human musk of people who had decided laws were suggestions. [185]

Della was here to thwart a deal. [192]

Specifically, she was here to stop Maren Alcott from selling a recording — a wax cylinder that held, of all things, the last conversation between Della's father and his partner Sills before Sills turned informant. [224] Maren called it art. [228] She'd titled it something pretentious: "The Sound of Trust Breaking." [237] She'd been shopping it to collectors who paid for the grotesque and the intimate, people who mounted other people's grief on their walls like taxidermy. [259]

Della had until sunrise. [263] After that, a buyer from Charleston would arrive by boat and the cylinder would disappear into a private collection where Della could never reach it. [287]

She found Maren's stall near the far end where the pier's rot was worst and water seeped up between the planks with each wave. [311] Maren sat behind a table of curiosities — a telegraph key, a jar of teeth, three phonograph cylinders in velvet cases. [331] She was younger than Della expected, sharp-faced, with ink-stained fingers and an expression of curiously steadfast calm, as though she had decided long ago that nothing could unsettle her and had simply held to that decision. [363]

"I know who you are," Maren said. [370]

"Then you know what I want." [376]

"I do. And I'm not selling it to you. You'd destroy it." [389]

"It's my father's voice." [393]

"It's history." [395]

They regarded each other across the table, and around them the market hummed its low commerce. [411] Della tried to buy it outright. [417] Maren refused. [419] Della offered trade — the watch fob, which was genuinely valuable, eighteenth-century silver with a maritime engraving. [432] Maren turned it over in her hands, admired it, set it down, and refused again. [446] Della tried threat, then appeal, then threat dressed as appeal. [456] Each approach was a false start, a door opened and shut. [467]

Through these false starts something strange happened: a truce of hush settled between them. [480] Not friendship, not agreement, but a mutual recognition that they were both people who lived by listening. [496] The silences between their volleys grew longer and more comfortable, filled with the creak of the pier and the slap of tide. [518] It was a comforting unease, like sitting beside a fire you know will eventually go out. [534]

"Play it for me," Della said at last. [541]

Maren hesitated, then set the cylinder on a small portable phonograph. [552] The needle found the groove. [557]

Her father's voice filled the stall, low and careful, talking to a man he still trusted about a run they'd never make. [578] Sills laughed at something. [582] Her father laughed back. [586] The trust hadn't broken yet on the recording. [594] That was the horror of it — the breaking was in what came after, in the silence the cylinder couldn't hold. [613]

When it ended, Della realized she was crying, and that Maren was not looking away. [628]

"You can't capture the sound of trust breaking," Della said. [639] "It doesn't make a sound. It just stops." [647]

Maren lifted the cylinder from the phonograph. [654] She placed it in Della's hands. [660]

"Take the watch fob too," Della whispered. [667]

"Keep it," Maren said. [671] "I don't need payment for giving someone back their own ghost." [681]

Della walked out through the market as the first gray light leaked between the planks overhead. [696] Sunrise was coming. [699] The watch fob ticked against her wrist, curiously steadfast, keeping time for a world that did not deserve such precision. [718] She held the cylinder against her chest and climbed the stairs into the ordinary, terrible morning. [733]
