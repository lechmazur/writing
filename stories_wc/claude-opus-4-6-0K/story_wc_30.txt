The tidal atrium breathed twice a day. [7] Salt water rose through the marble floor grates at intervals governed by the moon, filling the reading halls to waist height before retreating, leaving behind ribbons of kelp and the faint mineral smell of the deep. [43] Maren worked through every flooding, her titan-gear exoskeleton hissing softly as its hydraulic joints compensated for the drag of water against her legs. [66] She was the librarian here -- the only one left, after tomorrow disappeared. [78]

No one called it an apocalypse. [84] The calendar simply stopped producing new days. [91] Dawn still arrived, tides still moved, but each morning opened onto the same date, the same light, the same arrangement of clouds drifting above the atrium's glass ceiling. [119] People wandered away in confusion or despair. [126] Maren stayed. [128] She had books to tend, and wonder was a thing that needed tending most when routine threatened to flatten everything into sameness. [150]

Her titan-gear -- a salvaged industrial frame she'd bolted onto a harness of leather and brass -- let her wade through chest-deep water to reach the submerged stacks. [176] With it she could lift waterlogged folios that weighed as much as anchor chain. [190] Without it she was slight, bird-boned, unremarkable. [197] She preferred the contradiction: the delicate woman inside the giant's skeleton. [208] It was the first contradiction she'd learned to accept, and acceptance had become her method for surviving everything that followed. [228]

Because Maren's self fluctuated with moon phases. [235]

At the new moon she was quiet, almost translucent in purpose, a creature of reflex who shelved and cataloged without needing to think. [258] By the first quarter she became argumentative, passionate, convinced the collection should be reorganized by emotional resonance rather than subject. [278] The full moon brought someone else entirely -- a woman who remembered a fishing village, a father's hands mending nets, a life Maren had never lived. [303] And at the last quarter she grieved, though she could not name what she had lost. [319]

Migrating identities, the old texts called it. [326] A condition in which the soul refuses to settle, crossing borders within itself the way birds cross hemispheres. [344] There was no cure. [348] There was only acceptance -- holding every version of herself at once, letting them contradict without demanding resolution. [365]

On full-moon mornings she carried the fisherman's bamboo creel instead of her cataloging satchel. [379] It had arrived with the tide months ago, or perhaps the same day repeated, and her full-moon self had claimed it immediately, recognizing it the way a hand recognizes a glove. [410] She waded through the atrium collecting not books but the small silver fish that swam in through the grates -- smelt, quick and glittering, drawn by the library's warmth. [438] She would gather them gently, cupping each one before lowering it into the creel's woven chamber. [454] Then she carried them to the furnace room behind the east stacks, where she had learned -- in some phase she could no longer identify -- to smelt metal from the sediment the tides deposited. [487] The fish she released into the fountain basin. [495] The metal she worked into clasps and hinges for damaged bindings. [506]

It made no logical sense: a librarian in a giant's frame, catching fish in a book repository, extracting metal from mud, repairing volumes that no new reader might ever open. [536] But sense was not what held the world together after tomorrow vanished. [548] Wonder was. [550]

The pale winter sun angling through the glass roof each not-quite-morning, casting the same rhomboids of light across the water's surface -- she could choose to see that as repetition or as miracle. [582] She chose miracle. [585] Every phase, every self that rose in her chose it again, independently, as though wonder were the one thing all her identities shared. [608]

The tide was rising now. [613] Maren sealed her gauntlets, felt the titan-gear lock around her forearms, and stepped down into the advancing water. [631] The creel hung at her hip. [637] A folio of maritime charts floated free from a lower shelf, its pages spreading like wings, and she caught it before it could drift beyond reach. [663] She held it to her chest -- the enormous mechanical arms cradling a paper bird -- and stood still in the silver water, in the winter light, in the day that would not end and did not need to. [700]

Wonder lived here, in the contradiction, in the staying. [709]
