The ridgeway ran like a spine along the top of the world, and Sable could not stop her hands from shaking. [22]

She had carried relics for eleven years now, ever since Master Orwen had placed the first artifact in her palms and told her that trembling was not weakness but sensitivity — that the objects she ferried between temples and vaults and forgotten shrines needed a courier who could feel their resonance. [68] Then one autumn he had simply not returned from the northern passes, leaving behind his workshop, his unfinished maps, and a single student who still listened for his footstep on the stair. [93]

Tonight the auroras were especially fierce. [99] Green and violet curtains shivered across the sky, casting the rocky path in shifting, otherworldly light. [114] Sable adjusted the padded case strapped to her chest and pressed on. [126] Inside the case, nestled in silk, lay the dragonfly-wing pendant — a thing so old that the temple archivists could not agree whether it was three hundred years or three thousand. [154] Its wings were hammered from some metal that no longer had a name, thin enough to be translucent, veined with channels that caught even the faintest vibration and sang it back. [181]

That was why her hands troubled her. [188] Every tremor in her fingers fed into the pendant, and the pendant answered by vibrating sympathetically, amplifying the frequency until the air around it hummed. [210] She had discovered this on the first night of the journey when she'd unwrapped it to check for damage and the thing had nearly sung itself off the table. [237] Master Orwen would have known what that meant. [245] She only knew it made her nervous, which made her shake harder, which made the pendant sing louder — a feedback loop she managed by breathing exercises and by never, ever holding the relic with bare skin. [278]

But the auroras were doing something new. [285] As she climbed the ridgeway's highest switchback, the pendant's hum rose to match a faint drone rolling down from the lights above, and the case grew warm against her sternum. [312] She stopped, unclasped the lid with gloved hands, and looked. [323]

The dragonfly wings were glowing. [328] Between the veins, in the tiny channels, something luminous pulsed like captured aurora. [339] And where the glow touched the silk lining, she saw — impossibly — tiny green filaments pushing upward, curling, splitting into leaves no bigger than eyelashes. [360] Seeds that must have been trapped in the silk for decades were beginning to germinate, coaxed to life by the pendant's vibration and the strange light feeding through it. [385]

Sable exhaled. [387] She thought of Orwen, who had always told her the relics were not dead things. [400] "Your job," he'd said, "is to coax wonder from the routine — to remind people that the parcel they're receiving is not just cargo." [422] She had carried those words across years the way she carried artifacts: carefully, close to the chest. [437]

She knelt on the ridge, the auroras painting her shoulders, and watched the seedlings unfurl. [451] The pendant extended what should have been a brief encounter between light and dormant life into something sustained, resonant, lasting. [467] Minutes passed and the tiny plants kept growing, reaching toward the glow as though it were sunlight. [482]

This, she realized, was what the pendant did. [490] It was not a weapon or a key or a crown. [500] It was a bridge between energies too fleeting to matter on their own, a device that extended brief encounters into transformations. [518] Somewhere in the deep past a maker had understood that the most powerful thing in the world was sustained attention. [536]

She closed the case gently, leaving a gap for the seedlings, and stood. [549] Below the ridge the valley was dark, and beyond it the next temple waited for its delivery. [565] The archivists would catalogue the pendant, write their cautious descriptions, and shelve it. [577] In a generation no one living would remember Sable's name or her shaking hands. [590] Across the long fade from memory to myth, the pendant would become legend, its purpose embroidered beyond recognition. [605]

But tonight, on the aurora-lit ridgeway, she had seen it wake seeds in silk. [619] She had felt it harmonize with the sky. [627] That was not myth. [631] That was Tuesday. [634]

She smiled — the first unstrained smile in weeks — and her hands, for a few paces at least, were perfectly still. [653] The pendant hummed softly in its case, content, the tiny green leaves trembling with the rhythm of her walk as she carried wonder down the mountain and into the waiting dark. [685]

Orwen would have liked that, she thought. [692] He always said the best deliveries changed the courier too. [702]
