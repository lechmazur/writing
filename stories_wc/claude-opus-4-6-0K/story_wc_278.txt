The Laboratory of Lost Sounds occupied the basement of a building that no longer existed above ground, its upper floors having collapsed into memory sometime during the last century. [30] Maren descended the spiral stairs each evening, her arms sleeved in constellations she had inked herself -- Cassiopeia climbing her left wrist, Orion straddling her right shoulder -- because before she became the keeper of this place, she had been a constellation tattooist, mapping the night sky onto skin in a dozen cities. [72] Now she mapped something else: the sounds that time had swallowed. [82]

The laboratory hummed with equipment that shouldn't have worked. [91] Reel-to-reel machines threaded with ghost tape, spectrographs that visualized frequencies no living ear could parse, and at the center of it all, the Loom -- a device whose firmware had been written by a dead engineer and which, since his passing, operated with intentions of its own. [133] Haunted firmware, Maren called it, because the code rewrote itself at night, inserting subroutines that corresponded to no known function. [152] Sometimes the Loom recorded sounds from rooms that hadn't existed for decades. [163] Sometimes it played them back at 3 a.m., filling the laboratory with the laughter of strangers, the creak of doors long since burned. [184]

It was the Loom that first captured the crying. [193]

A baby's wail, thin and ancient, surfacing through static like a hand reaching through water. [207] Maren couldn't identify it at first, but the haunted firmware could. [218] It parsed the cry into phonemic clusters, and when she fed the data through her own algorithm -- one she'd built years ago, designed to translate baby cries into their root needs: hunger, pain, fear, loneliness -- the output was a single word repeated: *guilty*. [256]

That was when time folded in on itself. [264]

Not dramatically, not with thunder. [269] With meteor hush -- that vast, weightless silence that follows a streak of light across the sky. [284] The laboratory's clocks softened. [288] Hours nested inside minutes. [292] Maren found herself standing at an antique escritoire that had always been in the corner but that she had never opened, and inside its drawers lay bundles of handwritten letters, brittle and fox-spotted, addressed to no one. [323]

The letters were from her grandmother. [329] Maren recognized the penmanship -- the sharp descenders, the way every *s* curled like smoke. [342] Her grandmother, who had given up a child before Maren's mother was born. [354] A child no one spoke of. [360] The letters were unsent apologies, decades of them, each one trying to explain an abandonment that could never be explained, each one failing, each one folded shut again. [386]

The crying in the Loom was that child. [394] Not a literal infant, but the sound of a wound preserved in the architecture of the building, tethered to the place where guilt had been written down and hidden. [421] The haunted firmware had found it because haunted things recognize each other. [432]

Maren understood then why she had come to the Laboratory of Lost Sounds, why she had left tattooing behind. [449] She had carried her own dissonance -- her grandmother's secret, inherited wordlessly, a static hum beneath every family gathering, every silence at the dinner table. [470] She had come here to hush it. [477]

She took the piece of amber from around her neck. [487] Inside it, a prehistoric fly was suspended mid-flight, a creature tethered forever in resin, caught between one moment and the next. [507] Her grandmother had given it to her as a girl, saying, *Some things are preserved so they can finally be witnessed.* [526]

Maren placed the amber on the Loom's resonance plate. [535] She fed the letters into the spectrograph, letting the machine read the pressure of the pen, the hesitations, the places where tears had warped the paper. [558] The firmware translated these into sound -- not words, but a frequency that mirrored the crying exactly, a counter-wave. [575]

The two sounds met and canceled each other: the cry and the apology, the wound and the witness. [591]

Silence filled the laboratory, but not the silence of absence. [601] The silence of resolution. [605] Meteor hush. [607]

Maren stood in the folded dark, her constellation-covered hands resting on the Loom, and felt the dissonance drain from her bones like water from cupped palms. [633] The amber glowed faintly on the resonance plate, the ancient fly inside it no longer frozen but somehow, impossibly, at rest. [652]

She would tether no more ghosts to this place. [661] She gathered the letters, pressed them to her chest, and climbed the spiral stairs toward whatever existed above ground now -- toward sky, toward the real constellations, toward a morning unfolded and new. [693]
