Maren sat at her booth at the base of Lightning Tower Seven as the last amber light of evening pooled across the city like spilled honey. [24] The blackout was three hours old now, and the skyline had never looked so honest, stripped of its electric vanity, just rooftops and chimney smoke against a sky the color of nectar at dusk. [54] She was the toll keeper. [59] Had been for eleven years. [64] Every technician, every storm-chaser, every inspector who climbed the tower paid their toll, not in coin but in conversation. [80] Maren asked questions, they answered, and she let them pass. [90] Simple enough, except for the part about Maren herself: she was involuntarily truthful. [102] Something in her neurology, the doctors said, some misfired circuit that made deception impossible. [115] She could not lie, not even politely. [122] This made her excellent at her job and terrible at dinner parties. [133]

The drone beehives had failed at 4:47 PM. [141] She knew the exact minute because she had felt the tower shudder, a deep subsonic groan as ten thousand mechanical pollinators stopped circulating through the conductor arrays. [166] The drones were the tower's nervous system: tiny winged machines modeled on honeybees, weaving between the capacitor rods, distributing charge, preventing overload. [187] Without them, the first bolt of the evening storm had struck Tower Seven like a fist, and instead of being collected and routed, the energy cascaded backward through the grid. [214] City-wide blackout, just like that. [220]

Now Inspector Luce was climbing the stairs, and Maren could hear his boots ringing on the iron. [237]

"Toll," she said when he reached her booth. [245]

He set a lacquer box on the counter between them. [255] It was beautiful, black and deep red, with gold leaf patterning that caught the fading light. [270] "Found this in the hive chamber," he said. [278] "The queen cell." [281]

Maren studied it. [284] Each drone beehive had a central queen unit, a master controller that coordinated the swarm. [297] This box was not standard equipment. [303]

"Open it," Luce said. [307]

She lifted the lid. [311] Inside, nestled in velvet, was a matchbox, old-fashioned and wooden, the kind you might find in a curiosity shop. [330] She slid it open. [334] No matches. [336] Instead, a slip of paper, folded tight, with words written in careful script: What feeds on lightning but starves in the dark? [356] What hums without mouth and builds without hands? [364] Kill the answer and the city forgets how to breathe. [374]

"A riddle," Maren said. [378]

"Cryptic nonsense," Luce muttered. [382] "Sabotage, obviously. [384] Someone planted this in the queen cell and corrupted the swarm logic." [394]

Maren read the riddle again. [399] The answer was the drones themselves. [405] Someone had wanted Tower Seven to reveal its own fragility, to show the city what happened when the small, wondrous things were taken for granted. [429]

"You know who did this," Luce said. [437] It was not a question. [442] He knew about her condition. [448]

And there it was, the terrible gravity of involuntary truth. [458] Because Maren did know. [462] She had seen old Gareth, the retired chief engineer, climbing the tower that morning with his tool satchel and his sad knowing smile. [483] Gareth, who had designed the original drone beehives. [491] Gareth, who had spent thirty years trying to make people understand that the towers were not just infrastructure but ecosystems, living and delicate and extraordinary. [514] Gareth, whose deepest motivation was to preserve wonder in routine. [523]

"It was Gareth," she said, and the words tasted like ash. [534]

Luce nodded, unsurprised. [537] He took the lacquer box and turned toward the stairs. [547]

"He was not trying to hurt anyone," Maren added, because she could not stop truth once it started moving. [565] "He wanted people to notice. [570] To look up at the towers and remember that something miraculous happens here every single day, lightning caught and tamed by ten thousand tiny wings. [594] He wanted the blackout to make people see." [602]

Luce paused on the landing. [607] "A dangerous way to make a point." [614]

"Yes," Maren agreed, because it was. [621]

The dusk deepened around them, thick and golden as old honey. [632] Somewhere across the dark city, she imagined Gareth sitting on his porch, watching the sky, waiting for stars that only appeared when the grid went silent. [658] Above her, Tower Seven stood quiet against the amber horizon, its conductor rods bare, its hive chambers empty and waiting. [677]

She closed the matchbox, slipped the riddle into her pocket, and settled back into her booth. [693]

Tomorrow the drones would be reprogrammed. [700] The lights would return. [704] People would forget. [707]

But Maren would keep the riddle. [713] She would ask it of every technician who paid their toll, and she would watch their faces as they worked out the answer, and for one brief moment before they climbed into the humming dark, they would remember to wonder. [751]

That was her toll. [755] That was enough. [758]
