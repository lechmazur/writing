The magnetic arbor hung above the clouds like a cathedral of living iron, its branches curving in great spiraling arcs that followed invisible field lines only Senna could feel humming through her teeth. [33] She had climbed here after the spirit left, after its luminous form had dissolved through the lattice of magnetized bark and drifted downward into the cloud sea, leaving behind nothing but a faint ozone smell and a single seed resting in the crook of two branches. [72]

Senna pressed her fingers against the seed's surface and felt the familiar texture of cuneiform wedges pressed into its shell. [91] Of course there would be writing. [97] There was always writing in the places spirits abandoned. [106]

She was, by training and by temperament, a cuneiform translator—kindly methodical in her approach, the sort of scholar who numbered her notes and color-coded her uncertainties. [132] Back in the university districts below the cloud line, colleagues had called her meticulous to the point of tenderness, as if each ancient symbol were a small creature she was trying not to startle. [163] That care had served her well through twenty years of deciphering Sumerian administrative records and Akkadian hymns. [178] It had not prepared her for the moment a spirit materialized in her study, spoke in a language older than any she had catalogued, and invited her to follow it upward. [205]

She had followed because she needed to understand the physics of transition—the precise mechanism by which consciousness crossed from one state of being into another. [231] Her brother Tariq had transitioned eleven months ago, not into spirit form but into simple absence, his body found at his desk with his hand still resting on an untranslated tablet. [261] The coroner called it cardiac arrest. [268] Senna called it unfinished business. [274]

Tariq had been the one to theorize that the magnetic arbors, those impossible trees growing where atmosphere thinned to almost nothing, were waypoints. [295] Places where spirits paused before moving on. [303] He believed that if you could catch one at the threshold, you could map the transition, chart the border between presence and absence the way ancient scribes had charted the border between earth and underworld. [337]

His ambition had haunted her ever since. [344] Not his ghost—she had looked, desperately—but the ambition itself, the unresolved question that clung to her ribs like a second skeleton. [367] Haunted ambitions, she had written in her journal, are worse than haunted houses because you carry the haunting with you. [388]

Now she turned the knowledge fruit seed in her palm and began to read. [401] The cuneiform was archaic, pre-Sargonic, but the wedge patterns were unmistakable. [414] She worked through them the way she always did, through analogical thinking—comparing each unfamiliar sign to known forms, building bridges of resemblance. [436] This symbol curved like the sign for "water" but carried an extra vertical, suggesting flow with resistance. [452] That cluster echoed the logogram for "breath" but was nested inside the determinative for "stone," implying breath held, breath made solid. [473]

Slowly a meaning crystallized. [477] The inscription described not a place but a process: the moment a spirit shed its magnetic anchor and became weightless enough to pass through matter. [499] Transition was not departure, the text insisted. [507] It was a change in resonance. [513] The spirit did not leave; it simply began vibrating at a frequency the arbor could no longer hold. [530]

Senna's eyes burned. [533] She thought of Tariq's hand on that tablet, his heart stopping mid-sentence, his consciousness shifting to a frequency his body could no longer hold. [555] She pressed the seed against her chest and felt it pulse faintly, magnetically, as though responding to the iron in her blood. [576]

She understood now what the spirit had wanted her to find. [587] Not answers exactly, but the architecture of the question—the framework through which answers might eventually grow. [602] The seed was meant to be planted here in the arbor, where magnetic fields would nurture whatever knowledge fruit it bore. [621] It was an invitation to reestablish the work Tariq had begun, to root his interrupted research in living wood so it could continue branching long after she herself transitioned. [649]

Senna knelt on the magnetized branch, feeling the hum travel through her kneecaps and up her spine. [667] She pressed the seed into a fissure in the bark where two field lines converged. [681] It sank in easily, as if the tree had been waiting. [692]

Above her, the sky was the deep indigo of touching distance—so close to the stars she could almost feel their warmth. [713] Below, the clouds shifted like pages turning. [721] Somewhere in that layered atmosphere, spirits resonated at frequencies she could not yet hear but was learning, slowly, kindly, methodically, to read. [742]

She whispered Tariq's name into the bark and felt the arbor carry it downward through its roots into the magnetic heart of the world, where all unfinished sentences eventually find their endings. [775]
