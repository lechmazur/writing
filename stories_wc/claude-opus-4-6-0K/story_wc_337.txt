The prism sanctuary had no walls, only columns of crystal that caught starlight and fractured it into pale rivers of color across the stone floor. [27] Maren knelt at the center, her tools spread before her on a cloth that had once been white but was now stained with the residue of a hundred broken faces. [54] She was a mask restorer by trade, though the word "broken" applied as much to her as to the artifacts she mended. [73] Every mask she repaired took something from her—a sliver of sound, a fragment of her own voice—until the silence she carried had become a physical weight, accumulating in her chest like silt at the bottom of a still pond. [106]

Tonight she had not come to fix a mask. [114] Tonight she had come to exhume something buried deeper than porcelain and lacquer. [126]

The fisherman's net lay coiled before her like the shed skin of some vast sea creature. [141] Centuries had hardened its fibers into something closer to wire than rope, and its knots—hundreds of them, each tied by hands long since dissolved to salt and memory—held fast with a stubbornness that mocked the passage of time. [176] Inside those knots, Maren believed, were the voices of the drowned. [187] Not metaphorically. [189] She had heard them whispering when she first touched the net three days ago in the archive beneath the sanctuary, their syllables tangled in hemp and brine. [213] Restless spirits, caught like fish in the very tool that had failed to save them. [227]

She picked up her tapestry needle, its shaft long and curved, made for threading through dense weave without tearing. [244] It was the only instrument precise enough for this work. [254] She slid the needle's tip into the first knot and began to unravel. [266]

The knot resisted, then gave. [271] A sound escaped—not a word exactly, but the ghost of a breath, the shape a mouth makes before speaking. [290] It drifted upward through the crystal columns and scattered into colored light. [301] Maren felt the silence in her chest shift, making room, absorbing the whisper the way soil absorbs rain. [318]

"You're collecting them," said a voice behind her. [326]

She did not turn. [330] She knew the voice. [334] Elin had followed her, as Elin always did when Maren tried to work alone. [347] The younger woman stepped into the fractured starlight and sat across from her, pulling her knees to her chest. [365]

"Not collecting," Maren said. [369] "Grounding." [370]

"There's a difference?" [373]

"Collecting is keeping. Grounding is letting them settle." [381] She worked the needle into a second knot, and this time the released sound was clearer—a man's voice, mid-sentence, saying something about the tide. [403] It passed through Maren and faded into the stone beneath them. [413]

Elin was quiet for a moment, watching the colors shift as clouds moved across the stars above. [429] "Is that why you've gone so silent these past years? You've been taking in the unrest of every broken thing you've touched?" [451]

Maren's hands paused on the net. [457] This was the secret she had never shared, the truth she had carried like a stone in her throat. [475] The interlaced hush—her term for it, the way silences wove together inside her until they formed something dense and structural, a lattice of all the grief she had absorbed from shattered masks and forgotten relics. [509] She had become a repository of quiet anguish, and it was killing her slowly, not with noise but with the absence of it. [533]

"Yes," she said, and the admission cost her something. [542] A tremor passed through the crystal columns. [549] The starlight bent. [552]

"Then let me help." [556]

Elin reached for the net. [561] Maren almost pulled it away, but the look on Elin's face stopped her—not pity, not curiosity, but the steady recognition of someone who understood weight. [586] Maren handed her a second needle from the cloth. [595]

They worked together in the lucid unrest of the sanctuary, that strange wakefulness that comes when the world is too still and the mind too sharp. [621] Knot by knot, voice by voice, the net surrendered its dead. [632] Each released spirit passed through Maren first, but with Elin beside her, the silence did not accumulate as heavily. [650] It dispersed between them, shared, halved, bearable. [657]

By the time the last knot came undone, the net was nothing but loose threads and the sanctuary floor was warm beneath them. [679] The final voice—a woman singing a lullaby in a language neither of them knew—rose through the prisms and became light. [700]

Maren exhaled. [702] For the first time in years, the breath that left her carried sound: a low, unsteady hum, tuneless but alive. [721]

Elin smiled and said nothing, which was its own kind of gift. [733]

The starlight resettled around them, whole and unbroken, and the silence that remained was no longer a burial but a clearing—an open field where something, eventually, might choose to grow. [764]
