The kettle began its low murmur on the gas ring, and Maren knew she had these few minutes to herself before the world expected anything more of her. [30]

She sat cross-legged on the floor of the loft, the rain-beaded skylight above her casting soft, fractured light across her lap, each droplet a tiny lens refracting the amber afternoon into something rust-hued and gentle. [62] This had been Teodor's space once, back when he smelled of sawdust and big cats, back when his hands moved between the lathe and the whip with equal confidence. [89] Now it was hers, and she was learning what widows learn: that grief is not a single country but a series of border crossings, each one quieter than the last. [117]

On the workbench beside her lay an ash wood carving blank, pale as bone, roughly the size of a man's forearm. [137] Teodor had cut it from the old tree behind the winter quarters the week before the accident, intending to shape it into a lion's head for the center pole of their act. [168] He never touched it again. [173] For two years Maren couldn't touch it either, afraid that picking it up would mean admitting he was finished, that the shape inside the wood would never be the shape he'd imagined. [204]

But this morning she had carried it upstairs. [212]

She turned it in her hands now, feeling the grain, the faint ridges where his pencil had sketched guide marks she could barely see. [235] The blank contained him the way a fossil contains a season, through crystallized time, a single afternoon preserved in the cellulose: his breath, his intention, his not-yet. [261] She understood that holding it was not the same as holding him, but it was hauntingly practical, this object, because it gave her fingers something real to close around while her mind did the harder work of letting go. [299]

The kettle's murmur climbed half a note. [306]

Maren had spent the months after the funeral collecting what she called lessons from loss, though she never wrote them down because writing felt too permanent and loss, she had discovered, kept revising itself. [338] The first lesson was that courage looks different from the audience and from inside the cage. [352] Teodor had known that. [356] He'd told her once that a lion tamer's real skill is not bravery but timing, knowing the instant a cat shifts from curious to committed, the half-breath in which everything is here and gone. [390]

She had watched him work a thousand times, watched the big male pivot in the ring, watched Teodor's body answer with a step that was neither forward nor back but simply present, containing the animal's energy within the geometry of calm. [428] Contain, he'd said. [431] You don't fight the force. [436] You give it a shape it can live inside. [444]

That was the second lesson. [449]

Rain tapped harder on the skylight, and the beads merged into little rivers that drew crooked lines across the glass, blurring the rooftops beyond. [473] She pressed her thumb into the pencil marks on the blank and felt them give slightly, the soft ash accepting the pressure. [494] She would not carve a lion. [500] She would carve a hand, open-palmed, fingers slightly curled, the way Teodor's hand had looked resting on her knee during long train rides between towns. [524] A hand that held nothing and therefore could hold anything. [534] Here and gone, like the steam already beginning to wisp from the kettle's spout. [547]

The third lesson was the one she was still harvesting: that love does not ask you to preserve it perfectly. [566] It asks you to use it. [571] Use the wood. [574] Use the time. [577] Use the rust-colored peace that settles over a loft on a rainy afternoon when you have stopped demanding that the world return what it has taken. [601]

The kettle screamed. [604]

Maren set the blank down gently, unfolded her legs, and crossed the loft to the small kitchen alcove. [622] She poured the water over tea leaves, watched them spiral and darken, here and gone beneath the surface. [640] Then she carried the cup back to the workbench, set it on the ring-stained coaster Teodor had made from a slice of oak, and picked up his smallest gouge. [670]

The rain kept beading on the skylight. [677] The tea steamed. [680] And Maren, the lion tamer's widow, pressed the blade into the ash and began to give the shapeless thing a shape it could live inside. [706]
