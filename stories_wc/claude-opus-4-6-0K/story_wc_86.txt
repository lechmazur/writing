The parapet belonged to neither side, which was precisely why Maren chose it. [14]

Storm-worn stone, windblown and crumbling at the edges, it jutted from the ridge like a jaw clenched against the valley below. [34] Mist wrapped it most evenings, and tonight was no different — a low, gray veil that swallowed sound and softened the world into something almost bearable. [57]

Maren was a prisoner exchange negotiator — had been for eleven years. [67] She carried no weapon, flew no flag. [73] She carried instead an antique drawer pull in her coat pocket, brass with a porcelain face painted in faded blue flowers, and she turned it between her fingers now as she waited. [103]

The drawer pull had belonged to a desk in the home she'd burned down. [115] Not literally — she hadn't struck the match. [122] But she'd given the wrong name once, early in her career, confused two brothers on a manifest, and the one who should have come home went to the wrong camp instead. [151] By the time the error surfaced, his family's house had been shelled. [162] His wife. [164] His daughters. [166] The brass pull was all that remained when Maren walked through the wreckage looking for something to carry forward. [183]

She kept it to recycle the mistake into wisdom. [191] Every negotiation since, she checked the names three times. [200] Four. [201] She'd become uncommonly thoughtful — not in the way people meant when they said someone was kind, though she was that too, but in the way that meant she thought about everything, turned each detail like the drawer pull between her fingers, examined it for the fracture that could split a life open. [249]

Tonight's exchange had been synchronized through moon phases, as all of them were. [261] The method had started as practical necessity — radio signals could be intercepted, couriers captured, but the moon belonged to no army. [280] New moon for initial contact. [285] First quarter for confirmation. [289] Full moon for the exchange itself. [295] The waning crescent meant something had gone wrong. [303]

Tonight was full. [306]

Two prisoners. [308] One from each side. [312] A woman named Dalir who'd been held for eight months. [322] A man named Sorin who'd been held for three years. [331] Maren had spoken to both through intermediaries. [338] She knew Dalir still had family waiting. [345] She knew Sorin did not. [350]

The mist shifted. [353] Footsteps on stone — two sets, from opposite ends of the parapet. [364] This was the choreography of neutral territory: simultaneous approach, no advantage, the architecture of trust built on a foundation of mutual suspicion. [383]

Maren stepped to the center and raised both hands, palms open. [393]

"You know the terms," she said, her voice low, swallowed quickly by the fog. [406] A furrowed hush lay over everything, that particular silence that falls between apology and forgiveness — when the wrong has been named but the wound hasn't decided whether to close. [435]

Both escorts stopped. [438] The prisoners stood between them, blinking in the mist like creatures surfacing from underground. [450]

"Dalir," Maren said. [453] "Sorin. [454] Walk to me." [457]

They did. [459] Slowly. [460] Dalir's hands were shaking. [464] Sorin's face held the stillness of a man who had already rehearsed every possible ending and found none of them sufficient. [482]

When they reached her, Maren untethered the rope bindings from their wrists herself. [493] She always insisted on this. [498] It was the one thing she would not delegate — the physical act of release, the knot giving way beneath her fingers. [518] She needed to feel it. [523] She needed them to see a human face performing the unbinding, not a system, not a process, but hands that chose. [542]

The drawer pull pressed against her thigh through the coat pocket as she worked. [554] Blue flowers. [556] Ashes. [557] The name she'd given wrong. [562]

"You're free to cross," she told them. [568] "Walk forward. [570] Don't look back at them. [575] Look at what's ahead, even if it's only fog." [583]

Dalir crossed first, a small sound escaping her throat as she passed the threshold into her own side's territory. [600] Sorin lingered a moment. [604] He looked at Maren. [608]

"Where do I go?" he asked. [613] "There's no one." [616]

Maren held his gaze. [620] She thought of the burned house, the manifest, the porcelain flowers. [630] She thought of eleven years of turning mistakes over and over until they yielded something useful. [645]

"Forward," she said. [648] "Same as her. [651] Same as all of us." [655]

He walked into the mist. [660]

Maren stood alone on the parapet, the wind pulling at her coat, and waited for the moon to begin its waning. [679]
