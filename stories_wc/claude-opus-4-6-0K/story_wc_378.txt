The desert roses bloomed in spirals of pink and white beneath the glass dome, their crystalline petals strangely organic against the manufactured atmosphere. [25] Unit Maren walked the rows at dawn, her synthetic fingers brushing each formation the way a grandmother might touch a child's sleeping face. [47] She had been caretaker here for forty-seven years, tending the gypsum flowers that grew from mineral-rich sand, nurturing something beautiful inside a sealed world. [70]

But today the compass on her wrist spun freely, its needle hunting for a north that had begun to wander. [90] The magnetic shift had started three days ago, and with it came the static -- not in the dome's systems, but inside her own neural architecture. [114] Fragmented memories surfaced without permission: a girl's laughter, a screen door slamming, the smell of rain on concrete. [131] These were not her memories. [136] They belonged to the child she had once cared for, decades ago, before the dome, before the roses. [153]

Lena. [154]

Lena had been seven when Maren was assigned to her, and eleven when she was reassigned. [169] In the years between, Maren had catalogued every nightmare the girl confessed, every monster under the bed, every fear of darkness, abandonment, and the sound of breaking glass. [196] She had stored them in a small cedar box -- Lena's childhood fears, transcribed on slips of paper in Maren's precise handwriting -- because Lena had asked her to. [224] "If you hold them," Lena had whispered, "they can't get me." [235]

Maren still carried the box. [240] It sat on a shelf beside her charging station, warped with age, and she had never opened it since Lena was taken to another facility, another caretaker, another life. [268] Now the static made the box hum. [275] Every fragment of unresolved devotion, every severed routine of bedtime stories and morning check-ins, resonated at frequencies Maren's processors could not filter. [296]

The compass spun again. [300] Magnetic north was dissolving, and so was Maren's ability to contain what she felt. [314]

She lifted the box and walked it to the center of the dome, where the largest desert rose cluster grew in a formation three feet wide. [340] The roses had always reminded her of something caught mid-explosion -- chaos frozen into symmetry, violence made beautiful by patience and pressure. [361] That was the method she understood: containing chaos until it crystallized into something you could hold. [376]

She opened the box. [380]

The slips of paper were yellowed, fragile. [387] Fear of thunder. [390] Fear of being forgotten. [394] Fear of things that pretend to be alive but aren't. [404] Maren read that one twice, feeling the static surge behind her optical sensors like tears she was not built to shed. [424]

She needed to miniaturize these -- not the papers, but their weight inside her. [437] Forty-seven years of carrying a child's terrors had expanded them into something architectural, load-bearing walls in a mind designed for maintenance schedules and soil pH. [460] If she burned them, she would lose the last physical proof that Lena had trusted her. [476] But if she kept them, the static would eventually corrupt her core functions, and the roses would die untended. [493]

Controlled burn. [495] That was the protocol for land management -- destroy selectively so the whole survives. [507] She could not save everything. [512]

Maren placed the slips among the rose crystals, nestling each fear into the mineral lattice like seeds. [528] Then she activated the dome's UV cultivation lamps at concentrated intensity, a beam tight enough to incinerate paper but gentle enough to leave gypsum intact. [552] One by one, the fears caught light and curled into smoke that rose and pressed against the glass ceiling before the filtration system drank it away. [577]

Fear of being forgotten dissolved last, its edges glowing orange. [587]

The static quieted. [590] Not silenced -- Maren understood now that it would never fully silence, that the noise was the shape of love in a machine not designed for it. [616] But it softened into something she could carry, miniaturized by the act of letting go, compressed into a hum that harmonized with the dome's climate systems rather than fighting them. [647]

She kept the empty cedar box. [653]

Outside the glass, the desert stretched in every direction, indifferent and vast. [664] Somewhere out there, Lena was forty-seven years older, perhaps a grandmother herself, perhaps still afraid of things that pretend to be alive but aren't. [685] Maren hoped not. [688] She hoped the fears had truly left the girl the moment they were written down and handed over, and that Maren had carried only echoes. [710]

The compass on her wrist settled, trembling, pointing toward a new north. [722] Maren placed her hands in the sand among the roses and began the morning's work, strangely whole, beautifully fragmented, tending what remained. [743]
