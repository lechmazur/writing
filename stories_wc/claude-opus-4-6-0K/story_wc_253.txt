The turbines turned above the farmhouse like slow, pale gods, their shadows sweeping across the kitchen floor in rhythmic intervals. [22] Maren stood at the counter, holding a paring knife and a piece of pine, and she began to whittle. [39] She narrated as she worked, her voice pitched to the empty room in the cadence of a stage performer: "And now she presses the blade into the wood, carving away what does not belong, shaping the formless into something that might, if held at the right angle, resemble a sparrow." [78]

This was her method. [82] This was what remained after the happiness mandate. [90]

The mandate had come fourteen months ago, a federal directive requiring all public-facing citizens to demonstrate measurable positivity metrics. [107] Smile audits at grocery stores. [112] Laughter quotas in schools. [116] Grief counselors reassigned as joy facilitators. [122] The country had been remade into a hush--not silence exactly, but a enforced stillness where sorrow could not raise its voice above a whisper. [144] A remade hush, they called it on the underground forums, because the old silence of mourning had been dismantled and rebuilt into something mandated, hollow, and surveilled. [170]

Maren had been a performer before all of it. [179] Theater, mostly. [181] Small regional circuits where she played women who wept and raged and broke apart on stage so audiences could feel permission to do the same. [204] After the mandate, that kind of work dried up. [213] Emotional expression beyond the approved spectrum was flagged. [222] She retreated to this farmhouse, her dead mother's place, where the giant turbines the energy company had erected on the surrounding acreage hummed their low mechanical hymn day and night. [249]

She had not cried since the funeral. [256] Not because the mandate forbade it--out here, no one monitored her--but because something in her had simply closed. [274] Her face settled into blankness, a blank-faced performer with no audience and no script. [287] She moved through her days with the precision of someone who had forgotten what impulse felt like. [302]

So she narrated. [305]

"She lifts the dried flower bouquet from the hook beside the door," Maren said aloud, crossing the kitchen to do exactly that. [326] The bouquet had been her mother's last arrangement--lavender, thistle, baby's breath--hung upside down to preserve what could not be kept alive. [347] "She holds it to her nose, though it has long since lost its scent, because the gesture itself is a kind of language." [369]

The dramatic narration of mundane tasks had started as a way to fill the silence. [383] Then it became something else: a way to cultivate lightness in grief, to hover above the unbearable by turning it into story, into performance, into something shaped and deliberate rather than shapeless and crushing. [414] If she could not feel, she could at least describe. [424] If she could not weep, she could at least give the moment its proper weight in words. [439]

Was it dishonest? [442] She considered this as she set the bouquet down and returned to the pine sparrow taking shape under her knife. [460] The mandate demanded false joy. [465] Her narration demanded false distance. [470] Both were performances. [473] Both were morally ambiguous in the way all survival is morally ambiguous--you do what the moment requires and sort out the ethics later, if later comes. [498]

"She carves the beak now," Maren continued, "a small sharp point that could, in theory, open to sing." [517]

The turbine shadows passed over her hands. [524] Outside, the blades caught the last light of afternoon and threw it back in long, strobing flashes across the fields where her mother had once grown sunflowers. [549] The fields were bare now. [554] The energy company had paved access roads through them. [563]

She held up the wooden sparrow. [569] It was rough, lopsided, its wings uneven. [577] It would never fly. [581] But it existed where before there had been only a block of pine and an empty afternoon. [597]

"She places the sparrow beside the dried flowers," Maren said. [607] She did. [609] "She does not smile. [613] She does not cry. [617] She stands in the kitchen of her dead mother's house beneath the shadows of turbines that turn and turn and turn, and she breathes." [640]

She breathed. [642]

Somewhere beneath the blankness, beneath the narration and the careful distance, something shifted--not joy, not sorrow, but the faintest tremor of a feeling she could not yet name. [672] She did not chase it. [677] She picked up the knife. [682] She picked up another piece of pine. [689]

"And now," she said to no one, to everyone, to the remade hush of the world, "she begins again." [709]
