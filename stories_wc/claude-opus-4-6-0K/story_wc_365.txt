Elara pressed her fingertips against the corroded hull panel and listened with her skin. [12] The abandoned spaceport repair bay still hummed with residual frequencies — ghost vibrations from engines that hadn't fired in decades, thermal signatures of mechanics whose hands had long since turned to dust. [41] She cataloged each sensation on the translucent sheet before her, marking textures as topography, sounds as elevation lines, temperatures as color gradients. [59] This was her work: sensory cartography, the art of mapping what instruments couldn't quantify. [70]

But she hadn't come to Bay 7-North for a commission. [79]

She'd come because her father had died here, in some version of this place, and he had taken a truth with him. [99]

The green glass shard hung from a cord around her neck, warming against her sternum. [113] She'd found it seventeen years ago in her father's coat pocket, the morning after he vanished from their kitchen table mid-sentence, his mouth open around words he never finished. [139] The shard was not from any bottle or window she'd ever identified. [150] It was dense, faintly luminous, and when she held it to light at certain angles, she could see through it into places that shouldn't exist — repair bays identical to this one, but occupied, alive, shifted just a few degrees from the familiar. [187]

Parallel universes. [189] That was the term the old transit scholars used, though Elara thought it cheapened the experience. [201] Weaving between worlds felt more accurate — the way reality layered like fabric, and certain people, certain objects, could slip between the threads. [220]

Her father had been a weaver. [226] She was something worse: cyclically spontaneous, her ability surging and retreating on its own rhythm, impossible to predict or control. [242] Some weeks the shard showed her nothing. [249] Other times she'd be buying bread and feel the floor buckle beneath her into somewhere else entirely. [263] Tonight, standing in the skeletal bay where stripped shuttles rusted on their cradles, she felt the cycle cresting. [278]

The shard pulsed warm. [282]

She lifted it to her eye and the bay split open. [292]

Suddenly there were lights — harsh, industrial. [298] Welding arcs spat orange sparks across her vision. [306] A version of this place where the port had never closed, where mechanics shouted over the roar of plasma cutters. [323] She could smell solder and sweat, could feel the thrum of a working engine through the soles of her boots. [341] Her hands moved automatically, transcribing the sensory data onto her map — this universe's texture, its weight, its taste on the back of her tongue. [362]

Then she saw him. [366]

Her father stood at a workbench thirty meters away, alive and graying, his hands deep in the guts of a navigation console. [385] He looked up as though he felt her watching. [393] His face went white. [397]

He mouthed a word. [401] She couldn't hear it over the noise, but her cartographer's instincts read the shape of his lips, the tension in his jaw. [420] Not her name. [423] A warning. [425]

Behind her, the air thickened. [430] She felt a second frequency pressing in — another universe collapsing toward this junction point, drawn by the shard's resonance. [448] The bay's structure groaned. [452] If two parallel folds converged here, the overlap would be catastrophic, a wound in the weave that might not heal. [469]

She had to redirect it. [474]

Elara gripped the shard and poured every mapped sensation she'd ever recorded into it — years of textures, temperatures, pressures cataloged in her body's memory. [496] She fed the glass a different destination, a sensory signature from a dead world she'd charted once, an empty place that could absorb the collision without consequence. [521] The converging frequency shuddered, resisted, then bent away like a river finding a new channel. [535]

The second universe slid past without touching. [541]

When she opened her eyes, her father was closer. [550] He stood just beyond the boundary of the shard's window, and this time she could read his expression clearly — grief, and relief, and the terrible weight of something long carried. [578]

He pressed his palm flat against the air between them. [588] She pressed hers to match. [593] The shard translated his warmth into data she could feel: a frequency, a location, a specific fold in the weave. [612] He was telling her where to find him. [619] Not in the murmur of half-remembered dreams where she'd searched for years, chasing echoes of his unfinished sentence, but in solid coordinates her maps could follow. [645]

The truth he'd withheld — why he'd left, what the shard really was, what she really was — waited there, heavy enough to reshape every map she'd ever drawn. [672]

The cycle ebbed. [675] The repair bay went dark again, emptied of its parallel life. [684] Elara stood alone among dead machines, the green glass cooling against her chest. [695]

She unrolled a fresh sheet and began to chart the route home. [707]
