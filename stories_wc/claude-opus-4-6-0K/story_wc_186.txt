The glass humming pavilion had not shattered when civilization fell, and Maret could never decide whether that was meaningful or merely lucky. [24]

She walked its perimeter each evening, running her calloused fingers along the curved panes that still sang when the wind passed through them at the right angle. [50] The structure sat atop the coastal ridge like a cathedral made of breath, its hundreds of glass panels tuned to different frequencies by the artisans of the old world. [77] Now those artisans were dust, and their cities were dust, and their languages survived only in fragments Maret whispered to herself while she climbed the stairs of the beacon tower that rose from the pavilion's center. [110]

She was the custodian of that tower, the last in a line of keepers who had maintained the light for sailors who no longer existed. [134] The ocean was empty now, had been for decades, but Maret lit the beacon anyway because she believed that every repeated act was a conversation with the past, and she was retrocognitively blessed, which meant the past sometimes answered. [170]

It had started when she was nine, touching the stone wall of a ruin and suddenly tasting smoke from a fire that had burned three hundred years before. [197] She would hold objects and feel the echo of their histories unfurl behind her eyes like ink in water. [215] Not visions exactly, more like certainties: she would know what had happened, when, and to whom, with the same confidence that she knew her own name. [241]

This gift had led her to the broken crystal prism. [251]

She had found it in the rubble of an observatory forty miles inland, a hexagonal shaft of glass cracked cleanly into two pieces. [273] When she touched it, the retrocognition flooded her so completely she had fallen to her knees. [289] She saw the astronomer who had used it, a woman named Eda, who had spent her life tracking star paths across hand-drawn charts, convinced that the patterns of celestial movement encoded a message. [319] Eda had died believing she was close to proving it, that coincidences have meaning, that the universe rhymes on purpose. [339]

Maret carried the prism home in her coat and set it on the beacon-tower ledge where the light passed through it each night, splitting into spectral ribbons that painted the pavilion's glass walls. [370] The humming changed when the colors touched the panes. [380] It became something almost like language. [386]

She began to chart the stars herself, using Eda's methods, which the retrocognition had planted in her memory as clearly as if she had studied them for years. [412] Each night she recorded the positions of the constellations and overlaid them with the prismatic refractions cast by the broken crystal. [431] The crack in the prism created an aberration, a thin dark line in the spectrum that wandered across the glass pavilion like a finger tracing words on a fogged window. [459]

Maret called it a shard of hush, that silent line amid the color and the humming. [475] It moved according to the star paths, and she tracked it for eleven months, marking its position on the glass with a grease pencil until the pavilion was covered in a web of annotations. [506]

On the night the pattern completed, the shard of hush aligned with the deepest-voiced pane in the pavilion's north wall, and the humming stopped entirely. [531] In the silence, Maret felt the retrocognition rise unbidden. [540] She saw Eda again, younger now, standing in this very pavilion before the collapse, adjusting the prism in its original unbroken state. [558] Eda had been here. [562] Eda had tuned these panes. [567] The observatory and the pavilion and the beacon tower were parts of the same instrument, and the broken prism was not broken at all but deliberately split so the shard of hush could exist, a calibrated silence meant to rekindle something. [603]

The humming resumed, but different now, layered, as if the glass remembered every voice that had ever sung through it. [622] The beacon light poured through the cracked crystal and the spectrum blazed across the annotated walls, and Maret read the message in the convergence of color and silence and star path. [651] It was not words. [655] It was a coordinate, a place on the empty ocean where something waited. [667]

She stood in the pavilion among the thistledown notes of humming glass and felt hope rise in her chest like a weed through cracked stone, stubborn and spined and alive. [696] Coincidences had meaning. [699] Eda had known it. [703] The stars had confirmed it. [708] And somewhere beyond the dark water, the signal she rekindled tonight was finally reaching whatever it was meant to reach. [727]

Maret wiped her eyes, trimmed the beacon's wick, and waited for an answer from the sea. [743]
