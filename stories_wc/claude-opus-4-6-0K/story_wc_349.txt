The first customer had come and gone an hour ago. [9] Now the lull settled over Maren's shop like dust on a sill that had never known dust, because dust did not exist here above the clouds. [33] She was a clean slate vendor. [38] Her merchandise: small rectangular tablets of polished obsidian, each capable of drinking a person's past. [51] You pressed one to your chest, and it swallowed whatever you asked it to — a name, a year, the face of someone who had broken you. [75] Then the obsidian cleared to glass, and you walked away lighter. [85]

The shop occupied one chamber of the glass orchard library, a vast structure of transparent walls and crystal trees whose branches held books instead of fruit. [109] It floated upon a swirling sea of clouds, tethered to nothing. [120] The trees grew in rows, their glass trunks refracting ambient light into scattered prismatic patterns across the floor — mindfully scattered, the architect had insisted, each spectrum calibrated to illuminate a different shelf. [150]

Maren had been granted this concession as part of her glimmering parole — a conditional release that literally shimmered. [168] The terms were etched into a luminous band around her left wrist: she could walk free as long as she served. [189] As long as she helped others forget. [196] The glow pulsed faintly, reminding her that freedom was borrowed light. [207]

She adjusted a row of bottled moonlight on the counter. [217] These were her secondary wares — small vials of captured lunar glow, harvested from cloud-surface reflections on clear nights. [234] People bought them as reading lamps, as sleep aids, as modest gifts. [245] They sold steadily enough. [249] But today, her very first opening day, only one customer had appeared: a woman who wanted to forget her daughter's voice. [270]

Maren had not asked why. [275] She never would. [278] She pressed the obsidian to the woman's sternum, felt the tablet warm, watched it clear. [292] The woman blinked, touched her own throat as if checking whether she still had a voice herself, and left without a word. [313]

Now during the lull, Maren stood among the glass trees and thought about origin. [326]

Her motivation — the private engine beneath every transaction — was to find the place where stories begin. [343] Not their middles, where people came begging for excision. [352] Not their ends. [355] The beginning. [357] The first word before the wound. [363] She believed that if she could locate that threshold, she could understand why people accumulated so much pain, and perhaps stop selling the cure. [388]

Her method was strange but precise: she worked by quantifying absence. [399] Each clean slate she activated recorded what it consumed — not the content, but the shape of the hole left behind. [419] A forgotten name left a lacuna seven syllables wide. [429] A forgotten year carved a silence that hummed at a particular frequency. [440] Maren logged these dimensions in a leather journal beneath the counter, measuring the negative space of erased lives. [456]

Over time, she believed, the absences would map something. [465] A pattern. [467] A coordinate. [469] The precise location where narrative first cohered from chaos. [478]

She opened the journal now and picked up her stylus — a fine metal instrument she used to incise notations directly into the heavy pages, cutting grooves her fingers could read in the dark. [510] She recorded today's single transaction: one voice, female, approximately four years old at time of impression. [525] Depth of attachment: catastrophic. [529] Shape of resulting void: a spiral. [535]

Spirals were rare. [538] They suggested the memory had been load-bearing, that the entire architecture of a self had rested upon it. [555]

Maren held a bottle of moonlight up to the page and watched the incised grooves fill with pale luminescence. [572] The spiral notation glowed. [576] It looked, she thought, like the swirling clouds beneath the library — a void with motion, an absence that still churned with something like intent. [599]

She set the bottle down. [604] Outside the glass walls, the cloud sea shifted in slow, massive rotations, and the orchard's prismatic scatterings drifted across the floor in fragments that nonetheless composed a whole. [631]

That was what this place was. [637] That was what she was — a woman made of carefully removed pieces, paroled into a life of removing pieces from others, searching the collected debris for the first shard. [664] Her own slate had been wiped before she could read what it said, and her parole glimmered precisely because it fed on what she could not remember about herself. [693]

Somewhere in the accumulating record of everything people chose to lose, she would find it: the origin point, the place where stories begin. [717] Each absence she quantified brought the map closer to completion, each spiral and silence and seven-syllable gap composing a fragmented cartography of the human need to narrate and the equally human need to forget. [750]

The lull continued. [753] The moonlight held its pale glow. [759] Maren waited for her second customer, stylus ready, prepared to cut another absence into the page and bring herself one void closer to the source. [785]

I notice my count went slightly over. Let me revise:
