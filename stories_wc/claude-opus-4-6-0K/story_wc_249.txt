She had been their guinea pig for eleven months, the experimental treatment threading foreign memories into her own like gold wire through fraying cloth. [26] They called it Project Entangle, and she called it drowning in someone else's life. [40]

The sound wave garden occupied the eastern wing of the facility, a vast acoustic chamber where crystallized frequencies grew like coral from the floor and ceiling. [65] Each formation resonated at a different pitch when touched, and the researchers used them to map neural responses, to see which memories had taken root and which her brain still rejected. [95] Mira perched on the edge of the central observation platform, her bare feet dangling above a cluster of low-frequency stalactites that hummed like sleeping animals. [119] She was not supposed to be here at this hour. [129] She was quietly rebellious in ways they never seemed to catch, slipping from her room during the gap between night checks, when the monitors cycled and the hallways held their breath. [159]

It was the hush of the universe inhaling, that stillborn moment between midnight and whatever comes after, when even the machines seemed to pause. [183] Mira had learned to love this silence because it was the only time the entangled memories loosened their grip, and she could feel the edges of herself again. [211]

The memories belonged to Davi. [216] He had died fourteen months ago from the same neurodegenerative condition that was now unraveling her mind, and before he died, he had volunteered his neural recordings for the experimental treatment. [244] The theory was elegant: by encoding one patient's preserved memory architecture into another's deteriorating brain, the new host could rebuild neural pathways using the donor's structural blueprint. [270] What the researchers hadn't anticipated was that Mira would inherit not just the architecture but the content. [286] His childhood dog. [289] His mother's voice singing in Portuguese. [295] The way rain smelled to him on a particular Tuesday in March. [307]

And the dream. [310]

Davi had dreamed of an auric lagoon under starlight, a body of water that glowed amber and gold beneath an impossible sky. [333] He had dreamed it so often and so vividly that it had worn a groove in his neural tissue, and now Mira dreamed it too. [359] She dreamed it every night, standing at its shore, and sometimes she could feel him there beside her, not as a ghost but as a pressure, a warmth, a rhythm. [391]

He had been a drummer. [396] This she knew from the memories, but she also knew it from what her hands did now without her permission. [416] She caught herself drumming on everything, the cafeteria table, the armrest of the examination chair, her own thighs as she sat in the sound wave garden at night. [443] The researchers noted it in their files as a motor artifact. [454] Mira knew it was him. [459]

She began drumming now on the platform's metal railing, a soft paradiddle that sent vibrations cascading through the crystallized frequencies below. [479] The garden answered her. [483] Tones bloomed upward, layering into harmonics that filled the chamber with auroral sorrow, the kind of beauty that exists only because it is breaking. [505] She played the garden the way Davi would have played his drums, with abandon and precision at once, and the entangled memories surged through her like a tide. [534]

She could see the lagoon. [539] Not in sleep but here, superimposed over the garden, the golden water shimmering between the sound crystals. [555] The starlight bled through the facility ceiling. [562] She understood then what she was trying to do, what she had been trying to do every night she crept here in her quiet rebellion. [585] She was trying to breathe life into a shared dream, to make the lagoon real enough that some part of Davi could rest in it, could stop echoing through her skull and finally have a place to be. [620]

Her hands moved faster. [624] The garden sang in frequencies that the monitoring equipment would later register as anomalous. [636] The golden light intensified until she could feel the water at her ankles, warm and heavy as honey. [653] And there, in the space between one heartbeat and the next, she felt him let go. [668]

The drumming slowed. [671] The harmonics faded into a single, sustained tone that rang through the garden like a bell struck once and left to sing. [694] The lagoon dissolved, but the warmth remained in her bones, and the memories settled into her mind gently now, no longer intruders but tenants, no longer his alone but theirs. [727]

Mira sat in the silence that followed, her fingers still resting on the railing. [741] The universe exhaled. [744] Somewhere in her rewired brain, a dog barked, rain fell on a Tuesday, and a drummer finally set down his sticks. [765] She breathed in the quiet, and for the first time in eleven months, every breath belonged to her. [783]
