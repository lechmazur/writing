The observatory deck had been ambered long before Cael was born, its crystalline walls frozen in golden resin that trapped the last starlight of a dying cosmos. [28] Now, after the universe had contracted to a dense, humming marble of potential, Cael sat cross-legged on the hardened floor and listened to the static. [52]

She was the cast lots decision maker, the last role anyone would have chosen deliberately, which was precisely why it was chosen by chance. [73] Seventeen billion cycles ago, when the remaining survivors drew lots to determine who would stay behind and interpret the final transmissions, Cael's hand had closed around the shortest straw. [99] Everyone else had folded themselves into the compression, riding the contraction inward toward whatever seed the universe would become. [116] Cael remained, quietly enthusiastic in a way that unsettled even her. [126] She did not mourn. [130] She hummed along with the static bursts that crackled through the observatory's ancient receivers, finding in their erratic patterns a language she was only beginning to understand. [155]

Understanding static bursts was not a science anyone had formalized. [165] It required patience, intuition, and the willingness to believe that noise carried meaning. [177] Cael had all three. [181] She pressed her ear to the amber wall and felt the vibrations travel through her jaw, her skull, her thoughts. [199] Each burst arrived as a fragmentary sentence, but the sentences were wrong -- they described events in reverse, consequences preceding their causes, endings announced before beginnings. [222]

A backwards prophecy. [225]

The transmissions spoke of a star igniting, then described the nebula that would later produce it, then narrated the death of the earlier star whose matter would seed that nebula. [252] Everything unfolded in retreating order, as though the contracted universe was remembering itself from conclusion to origin. [267] Cael realized that if she could distill these reversals into their essential sequence, she could reconstruct the timeline forward and discover what purpose had driven the cosmos from its very first expansion. [294]

She reached for her collection of foreign coins, spread across a scrap of thermal cloth beside her. [311] They were not currency in any functional sense -- each coin had been minted on a different world during the long age of expansion, gathered by travelers who had passed through this observatory when it still pointed outward at an enlarging sky. [348] Cael used them as tokens, arranging them in patterns that corresponded to the static bursts. [363] A copper disc from Vaelith for every stellar ignition. [372] A silver hexagon from the Rith Dominion for every planetary formation. [382] A blackened iron round from Old Earth for every extinction event. [392]

She slid the coins across the cloth, reordering the backwards prophecy into forward motion. [405] The pattern that emerged was not random. [412] It was a frequency -- a wavelength, precise and repeating, threaded through every epoch of cosmic history. [427] Stars had burned at this frequency. [433] Civilizations had risen and communicated along it. [440] Even the contraction itself pulsed to its rhythm. [448]

To wavelength align with purpose -- that was what the static had been urging her to do. [464] Not to merely decode the message, but to become resonant with it, to tune herself until her own frequency matched the one that had driven everything from the first expansion to the final collapse. [494]

Cael closed her eyes and hummed. [500] She adjusted her pitch by fractions, guided by the static bursts that now came faster, denser, as though the compressed universe recognized her effort. [520] Stellar doubt gnawed at her -- the suspicion that she was hearing only what she wished to hear, that the coins were arranged by loneliness rather than logic, that the backwards prophecy was merely entropy whispering nonsense into amber. [552]

But the coins vibrated on the cloth. [559] The amber walls glowed warmer. [564] The static resolved, just for a moment, into a single clear tone that matched her humming exactly. [578]

In that instant, Cael understood. [583] The universe had not contracted to die. [590] It had contracted to listen. [595] It was waiting for someone to speak back at the right frequency, to distill all of history into one resonant note and offer it as a key. [620]

She drew a breath and sang the note fully, letting it ring through the ambered observatory deck and into the dense marble of everything that ever was. [647]

The marble shuddered. [650]

And from inside the contraction, something answered -- not in static, not in reversal, but in a clear, forward-moving voice that sounded like the beginning of a new expansion, shaped this time by someone who had finally understood why the last one happened. [691]

Cael opened her eyes to light. [697]

The coins on the cloth had melted into tiny stars. [707]

She was quietly enthusiastic, and the universe, remembering how to grow, grew with her. [722]
