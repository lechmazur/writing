The fog had not lifted from the Orchard District in three hundred years. [13] It moved through the skeletal trees like something alive, thick as wet wool, erasing the boundary between earth and sky until neither existed with certainty. [37] Maren had lived here all her life, pressing silver and sand into mirrors that no one came to buy, because no one came here at all. [59]

She was firmly grounded in her craft, in the way her hands knew heat and timing, in the way she understood that a mirror was not a reflection but a threshold. [89] Every morning she fired her kiln, and every evening she polished glass until it held the world more clearly than the world held itself. [112] She did not dream. [116] That was the problem. [120]

Once, years ago, she had dreamed of glass mountains rising beyond the fog, their peaks catching light that the Orchard District had forgotten. [141] The dream had come with a sound like synchronized breathing, as though the mountains themselves inhaled and exhaled with her sleeping body. [161] She had woken gasping, and the dream had fled through the cracks in her workshop walls, out into the fog where lost things went to dissolve. [188] She had not dreamed since. [193]

Now, upon the shimmer of twilight frost, the temperature dropped sharply enough to crystallize the fog into something almost visible, almost solid. [214] Maren stood in her doorway and watched the ruined orchard glitter. [225] Ice clung to branches that had not borne fruit in centuries. [236] For a moment, just a moment, she thought she saw the silhouette of glass mountains through the thinning haze. [254]

She went back inside and found the sextant. [262]

It had belonged to an astronomer who had wandered into the district decades ago, half-mad, claiming he could navigate by stars no one here could see. [288] He had left the instrument behind when he vanished, its arc cracked, its mirrors misaligned, its index arm bent at an angle that pointed toward nothing. [313] Maren had kept it on her workbench because it was, in its way, a kind of mirror -- a device that measured the distance between a person and the sky. [343] Now its brokenness seemed purposeful, as though it had been waiting for the right fracture in the world to match. [363]

She carried the broken sextant to the nearest clearing, where the frost was thickest and the fog breathed in slow, visible pulses. [385] She set it on a stump and knelt beside it. [394] The twilight frost shimmered, and Maren understood that she would not chase her runaway dream through the fog. [412] She would not hunt it. [417] She would recreate it. [421]

She closed her eyes and began to breathe. [429] Slowly at first, then matching her rhythm to the fog's ancient pulse, the way the mist expanded and contracted as if the whole district were a living lung. [457] Synchronized breathing. [459] Her chest rose with the fog, fell with it, until she could not tell where her body ended and the air began. [479] The boundary between Maren and the district erased itself, gently, like condensation clearing from a mirror's face. [494]

She saw the glass mountains. [499]

They were not behind the fog. [505] They were the fog, condensed and crystallized and stacked into impossible peaks that caught a twilight no sun had made. [525] The broken sextant on the stump began to hum, its cracked mirrors vibrating with a frequency she felt in her sternum. [546] She reached for it without opening her eyes, adjusted the bent index arm by feel, and sighted through it at the highest peak. [569]

The measurement it returned was not a number but a sensation: the exact distance between waking and dreaming, which was no distance at all. [593]

Maren opened her eyes. [597] The frost still shimmered. [601] The fog still breathed. [605] But now, in the clearing, standing upright on the frozen earth, was a mirror she had not made -- or perhaps had always been making. [628] It was seven feet tall, edged in frost, and in its surface the glass mountains rose perpetually, their slopes alive with refracted light. [651]

She touched the mirror's face and felt warmth. [659] The dream had not been runaway after all. [667] It had been waiting for her to stop searching the fog and instead become part of it, to erase the boundary between the maker and the made. [694]

She carried the mirror back to her workshop and set it beside the others. [707] But this one was different. [712] When she looked into it, she did not see her reflection. [722] She saw the mountains, breathing. [727] And for the first time in years, she knew she would dream tonight. [739]

The astronomer's sextant remained on the stump, its crack sealed with frost, pointing at the sky as if it finally remembered what stars were for. [764]
