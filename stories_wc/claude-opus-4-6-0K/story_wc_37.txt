In the mirror world, where every reflection runs backward and light remembers what darkness forgets, there stood an alchemical orchard greenhouse shrouded in endless night. [30]

Maren was its keeper, though she kept nothing well. [39] Her memories arrived like scattered seeds, some sprouting in wrong seasons, others refusing to root at all. [55] She was the last memory keeper of the Loom Realm, a place that had been dying for longer than anyone could recall — which was the central problem, since recollection itself had begun to rot. [87]

The greenhouse was vast, its iron ribs arching over rows of silver-barked trees that bore fruit made of condensed twilight. [106] Between the trunks, phosphorescent mosses pulsed in rhythms that once matched the heartbeats of entire villages. [121] Now they flickered arrhythmically, stuttering like a conversation no one could finish. [132] The only natural light entered through a single mica window set high in the eastern wall — thin sheets of mineral that split whatever glow touched them into layered, trembling bands. [161]

Maren pressed her palm against the mica each morning, though morning meant nothing here. [175] She pressed it because her hands remembered what her mind could not. [187] The warmth that answered was faint, the barest suggestion that somewhere beyond the endless night, dawn still existed. [204]

She had come to the greenhouse to rekindle a dying realm. [215] That much she held onto, though the specifics frayed like old thread. [227] The Loom Realm had once been sustained by woven dawns — great tapestries of first light braided together by communities singing in unison at the horizon's edge. [253] Each village had contributed a voice, each voice a color, each color a thread, and together they had woven the dawn that fed the orchard trees, which in turn fed the realm. [284] But the songs had been forgotten, and without them the dawns could not be woven, and without the dawns the trees bore only shadows. [307]

Maren knelt among the roots of the eldest tree, where a bundle of cloth held something she had wrapped long ago. [327] She unfolded it carefully: a sleeping infant made entirely of light, barely breathing, its radiance diminished to the paleness of old parchment. [349] This was the last dawn-child, born from the final weaving before the silence fell. [363] Maren began to swaddle it again in fresh linen soaked with dew from the alchemical branches, tucking the cloth tight around its cooling limbs. [385]

"Stay," she whispered, and the word unlocked something. [393]

A melody surfaced — not in her mind, but in her throat, as if her body had hidden it from her failing memory for safekeeping. [416] It was one of the forgotten songs, a lullaby that the orchard-tenders once sang to coax fruit from blossom. [435] The notes were simple, almost foolish in their plainness, but the mica window caught them and split them the way it split light, refracting the sound into harmonics that traveled down through the soil and out along the root network. [472]

In villages she could not see, people stirred. [480] A woman humming over bread dough found her melody shifting to match Maren's song. [493] A blacksmith's hammer began to ring in sympathy. [501] Children in a schoolyard clapped a rhythm they had never been taught. [513] This was how the songs had always worked — not as performance, but as contagion, spreading through forgotten songs that lived in muscle and bone rather than memory. [540] The music knits communities together the way mycelium knits a forest: invisibly, persistently, beneath every surface. [554]

The dawn-child stirred in its swaddling. [560] Color seeped back into its skin — first amber, then rose, then the deep violet that precedes true sunrise. [577] Maren sang harder, and the mica window blazed as harmonic threads wove themselves into the first new dawn the mirror world had seen in an age. [604]

She felt the release then — not freedom from, but freedom into. [615] Every scattered memory rushed back, not as coherent narrative but as warmth, as texture, as the knowledge that she had done this before and would do it again because realms do not stay rekindled. [647] They require tending. [650]

The dawn-child opened its eyes and light poured through the greenhouse, painting the silver bark gold. [665] Outside, the endless night thinned at its edges. [673] Maren lifted the child toward the mica window and watched the woven dawn unspool across the sky, binding what had been broken, swaddling the whole wounded world in the simple, startling act of beginning again. [706]

She would not remember this tomorrow. [712] But her throat would. [716] And that was enough to keep the realm alive until the next song found its way through the roots, through the glass, through the stubborn, scattered grace of forgetting everything except how to begin. [750]
