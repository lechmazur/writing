The fog sculpture garden had no curator, only Silas, whom the neighborhood children called the junkyard prophet. [18]

He earned the title years ago, back when he still lived among the scrap heaps at the edge of the estuary, pulling transmissions from dead cars and whispering what would happen to people before it did. [50] The trouble was he always forgot his own predictions moments after making them, as though his mind were a tide that delivered visions only to drag them back out to sea. [76] Precognitively forgetful, the clinic psychiatrist had written in a file Silas never read. [89] He saw what was coming and then lost it, left only with the ache of having known. [105]

Now he lived here, among the shapes. [112] The garden occupied a full city block where a maritime museum had once stood, its demolition leaving behind a flat gray expanse that the coastal fog colonized each evening, curling around the rusted iron armatures and salvaged hull plates Silas had arranged over decades into towering, skeletal forms. [151] By morning the fog would freeze on the metal in translucent sheets, and for a few hours the sculptures wore skins of ice that sang when the wind threaded through them. [180] By noon they were bare again, just bones. [188]

Silas kept a piece of plain chalk in his coat pocket, the same stick he had been wearing down since February. [207] Each night, when a premonition struck, he scrawled its essential image on whatever surface was nearest — a girder, a flagstone, the back of his own hand — knowing he would not remember it come sunrise. [241] The chalk marks were his only archive. [248] Most mornings he walked the garden reading his own handwriting like a stranger's mail, trying to locate meaning in symbols he could no longer decode. [270]

Tonight the fog was especially dense, the kind that swallowed sound the way old videotapes left unwatched on a shelf swallow time — slowly, in a hush nobody notices until the images are gone. [302] Silas felt that hush now, pressing against his eardrums. [312] He had been arranging driftwood as directional markers along the garden's gravel paths, pale branches pointing visitors toward each sculpture so they would not stumble in the murk. [339] But the arrows also served a private purpose: they traced the chronological order in which the sculptures had been built, a timeline of his aging body's labor. [363]

He paused at the seventh marker, the one pointing toward the piece he called "Threnody." [377] It was a column of salvaged organ pipes welded to a car chassis, and when fog condensed inside the pipes it produced a low, almost sub-audible hum that Silas believed was the sound of growing older — the sound of cells dividing one last reliable time, of cartilage thinning, of memory compacting into sediment. [420] Capturing that sound had been his obsession for three years. [430] He had tried recording it on tape, but the frequency was too low, or the machines too indifferent. [446] The only way to hold it was to stand inside the sculpture's ring of pipes and let the hum move through his sternum. [468]

He stepped inside now. [472] The hum rose. [475] A vision detonated behind his eyes: a girl, perhaps twelve, standing at the garden's entrance holding a flashlight, visiting the sculptures for the first time, weeping not from sadness but from recognition, as though she had been here in a dream. [510] He fumbled for the chalk and wrote on the nearest pipe: GIRL — FLASHLIGHT — MARCH. [523] By tomorrow he would have forgotten, but the chalk would remain, another echo pinned to iron. [537]

Clinging to echoes was all Silas had ever done. [546] Every sculpture was an echo of some ship or engine that had already perished. [559] Every chalk inscription was an echo of a future he glimpsed and released. [571] The fog itself was an echo of the ocean it had risen from. [583] He understood, standing inside "Threnody," that the hum was not merely the sound of growing older but the sound of everything in the world trying to remember what it used to be while simultaneously becoming something else. [617]

He pressed his palm flat against the coldest pipe. [626] The chalk in his pocket was shorter tonight than yesterday. [636] Someday it would be a nub, then dust, and he would need a new one, and the new one would not know what the old one had written. [663]

But for now the fog thickened and the pipes sang and somewhere a girl he would not remember seeing was already walking toward the garden, flashlight in hand, following driftwood arrows through the tidal dark. [697]

Silas listened. [699] He forgot. [701] He listened again. [704]
