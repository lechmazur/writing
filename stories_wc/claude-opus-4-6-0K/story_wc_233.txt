Every night for eleven months, Queen Elara dreamed of light hemorrhaging from the stars. [14] It fell in threads, delicate as lace, pooling in a grotto she had never visited but recognized the way one recognizes a wound. [36] The dreams left residue -- a metallic taste, a faint bruise behind her sternum -- and she woke each morning more certain that her crown meant nothing if she could not understand why the sky was unraveling for her alone. [69]

The council had issued three warnings. [75] The first was diplomatic: Your Majesty, the ridge is unstable. [84] The second was firm: The kingdom cannot afford to lose its sovereign to superstition. [96] The third -- the final warning -- came wrapped in silk but edged with threat: If the queen abandons her throne for a dream, the throne will not wait. [122]

She left the morning after. [127]

Elara had grown disenchanted long before the dreams began. [136] The wars she inherited had calcified into cold treaties, and her court had learned to smile without warmth, to bow without respect. [155] She ruled a kingdom of beautiful pretenses, and somewhere between the seventh peace accord and the twelfth state funeral, she had stopped believing that any of it touched something real. [181] The dreams, at least, bled. [186] The dreams, at least, demanded something of her. [194]

The climb began at the base of the Vethara Ridge, where basalt shoulders rose through a forest of white-barked pines. [214] She went with only Maren, her shield-bearer, a woman whose silence was softly commanding in a way Elara's speeches had never been. [235] Maren did not ask why they climbed. [242] She adjusted her pack, tested the rope, and set the first anchor into stone still warm from the day's heat. [261]

Halfway up, the ember grotto appeared -- a shallow cave in the ridgeline where the rock glowed faintly orange, veined with some mineral that held the sunset long after it had fled the sky. [294] They rested there, and the warmth seeped into Elara's palms as she pressed them flat against the walls. [313] In her dreams, this cave had always been a doorway, a place where the bleeding starlight gathered before it drained upward, defying gravity, returning to a wound it could not close. [340]

"We keep going," Elara said, and Maren nodded. [349]

The cobalt grotto waited above the cloudline. [356] They reached it as evening thickened, pulling themselves over a final lip of stone into a chamber open to the sky, its walls the deep impossible blue of lapis crushed and suspended in glass. [388] Clouds drifted below them like a second sea, and above, the first stars appeared -- tentative, trembling, as though they knew what was coming. [411]

Elara watched. [413]

It began as a single thread, a filament of silver peeling away from a star in the northern quarter, descending in a slow spiral that looked almost gentle until it struck the grotto floor and hissed. [446] Then another. [448] Then dozens, falling like luminous rain, each strand impossibly fine, each one leaving a faint scorch where it landed. [466] Bleeding starlight. [468] The beauty was precise and menacing, lace made of something that could cut. [480]

Maren inhaled sharply. [483] Elara reached for her hand. [488]

And then -- movement at the grotto's edge. [495] Small pulses of gold lifting from the warm stone below, drifting upward through the torn starlight. [509] Fireflies. [510] The first fireflies of summer, rising from the ridge as if the ember grotto had exhaled them. [525] Elara and Maren breathed out together, a shared exhale spotting the first of them as they floated into the cobalt dark, their living glow weaving between the falling threads of silver. [556]

The starlight did not stop bleeding. [562] But the fireflies rose to meet it, and where gold touched silver, the threads slowed, curled, and were absorbed into something warmer. [581] Elara understood then what the dreams had wanted her to see: the sky was not unraveling. [597] It was reaching down, and the earth was reaching up, and the wound was not a wound but a seam where two worlds had always been trying to touch. [625]

She had spent years holding a kingdom together with protocols and pretenses. [636] Here, the world held itself together through something rawer -- a mutual yearning that looked, from a distance, like destruction. [654]

"I am not going back," she whispered. [661]

Maren squeezed her hand. [665] "I know." [667]

Below them, the clouds shifted like restless silk, and above, the stars continued their delicate hemorrhage, each thread a menace and a gift, falling into a grotto that had waited centuries to receive them. [700] The fireflies rose and rose. [705] The queen sat in the lacy wreckage of heaven and felt, for the first time since her coronation, that she was exactly where power had always wanted her to be -- not commanding it, but kneeling inside it, letting it pass through her open hands.
