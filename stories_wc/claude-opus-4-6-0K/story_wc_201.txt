After the anesthesia wears off, the first thing Sera notices is how precisely she can feel her own body. [17] Every joint, every tendon, every vertebra reporting its exact position in space like coordinates on a grid she never asked to read. [36] The interrogators had done something to her nervous system during the nine weeks in the concrete room -- proprioceptive enhancement, the discharge summary called it, as though it were a gift rather than a side effect of what they had threaded through her spinal column. [72] She can feel the angle of her left wrist without looking. [82] She can feel the micro-rotation of each cervical vertebra when she turns her head. [94] Her body has become a series of precise measurements, and she hates every single one of them. [110]

She walks into the ultraviolet forest because the rehabilitation clinic stands at its edge and because she has nowhere else to go. [131]

The trees here fluoresce. [135] Something in the bark and leaf tissue absorbs the thin mountain sunlight and re-emits it shifted, so the canopy glows in soft violets and deep indigos that no healthy forest should wear. [164] They say it started after the chemical remediation upstream, minerals drawn through roots into cambium, the whole watershed quietly transfigured. [181] Sera does not care about the cause. [188] She cares that the light here looks like penance -- ultraviolet penance, the forest doing visible time for invisible sins committed against its soil. [209]

She knows something about that. [215]

In her jacket pocket, her fingers close around the pewter mask strap. [226] She kept it. [228] She should not have kept it, but the counselors at the clinic do not understand that certain objects are not souvenirs but equations. [249] The strap is cold, thin, slightly curved from the shape of the mask they had fitted over her face during sessions. [269] She runs her thumb along its pitted surface and her breathing changes immediately -- shallows, quickens -- and there it is: a memory surfacing not through thought but through the body's own alarm. [301] Remembering through trauma responses. [305] The counselors have a clinical phrase for it. [312] Sera has a simpler name: the only honest archive she possesses. [323]

Her shoulders seize. [326] She feels herself brace, every proprioceptively enhanced muscle in her torso locking into the posture the body learned in that room -- chin down, ribs contracted, spine curved to protect the organs. [356] The forest light washes over her in violet waves while she stands frozen on the trail. [370]

She breathes. [372] She counts. [374]

This is why she came here, though she could not have articulated it at the clinic's front desk. [391] She is trying to discover the mathematics of mercy. [400] Not the philosophy, not the theology -- the actual arithmetic. [409] How many times must a body brace before the bracing teaches it something other than fear? [424] What is the ratio of recalled pain to present stillness that produces, finally, release? [438] Is there a threshold -- measurable, repeatable -- beyond which the nervous system accepts that the danger has ended? [454]

She believes the answer lives in repetition. [461] Walk the forest. [464] Touch the strap. [467] Let the body seize and then, eventually, let it not. [477] Collect data points. [480] Map the curve. [483]

The violet light filters through the canopy and she watches her own shadow on the trail, displaced and strangely rooted at once, belonging neither to the woman she was before the concrete room nor to whatever she is becoming. [518] She is between formulae. [522]

She takes another step. [526] The forest hums with its own quiet contamination, its beauty made entirely from damage, and she thinks: yes. [545] This is the correct place. [550] Not a place of healing exactly, but a place where alteration is visible, where the consequence of what was done glows honestly in the bark and does not pretend to be unchanged. [580]

Her fingers release the pewter strap. [586] Her shoulders unlock by two degrees -- she can feel the precise angle because of course she can, because they made her body into an instrument and now she must learn to play it for her own purposes. [620]

Two degrees. [622] She notes it like a scientist. [628] Yesterday it was one. [632]

She does not know yet what the full equation looks like, whether the mathematics of mercy converges on a finite answer or stretches asymptotic toward something she can only approach and never reach. [664] But two is more than one. [670] The forest glows. [673] She walks deeper into the violet light, proprioception singing its terrible precise song in every nerve, and she lets it sing, and she counts, and she does not look away. [704]
