The shrine breathed. [3]

Maren could feel it in the way the candle flames leaned toward the walls, drawn by some invisible exhalation from deep within the glacier. [27] Hundreds of votives lined the carved niches, their light refracting through blue-white ice until the whole chamber seemed to glow with borrowed starlight, a cold and distant luminance that belonged to no sun she knew. [56]

She set the melted snow globe on the altar — a lump of fused glass and plastic, its tiny village now a smear of paint sealed beneath a warped dome. [83] She had pulled it from the wreck of the Astrid Lune, a research vessel that sank in these arctic waters carrying forty-three souls and whatever secrets they'd kept locked in their dreaming minds. [114]

Maren was a wreck-diver by trade, a ghost whisperer by inheritance. [125] Her grandmother had taught her that the dead don't scream; they murmur, and only through the living. [140] Specifically, they appear as cameo figures in the dreams of strangers — a face at the edge of a crowd scene, a hand passing a cup in some unrelated narrative. [166] These were windows of connection, her grandmother said, brief apertures where one consciousness pressed against another like palms on opposite sides of glass. [187]

For three months, Maren had been analyzing dream journals collected from the coastal village nearest the wreck site. [202] Fishermen, schoolteachers, children — none of them had known the Astrid Lune's crew, yet fragments of those drowned lives kept surfacing in their sleep. [224] A marine biologist named Dag appeared as a waiter in a baker's dream, carrying a tray of small glass animals. [243] The ship's captain materialized as a stranger reading aloud from a blank book in a teenager's nightmare. [259] Each cameo was a thread, and Maren was weaving them into a tapestry that would expose what truly happened aboard that vessel before it went down. [285]

She weaves truth carefully, her grandmother always warned, or truth weaves you. [296]

The official report blamed mechanical failure. [301] But Maren had found the melted snow globe in the captain's quarters, fused by heat that had no business existing on a ship that sank in freezing water. [328] And the dream appearances told a different story — one of deliberate sabotage, of a fire set in the lower hold, of someone who wanted the ship and its research to vanish beneath the ice. [360]

Tonight she had come to the glacier shrine to listen more closely. [372] The indigenous Sami families who maintained this place believed it amplified the voices of the water-dead, that the ice acted as a kind of antenna tuning into frequencies the open air dispersed. [402] Maren didn't know if she believed that, but she believed in tools, and she'd used stranger ones. [419]

She closed her eyes and placed her fingers on the snow globe's ruined surface. [433]

The dreams came. [436]

Not her own — she recognized them from the journals. [445] The baker's dream first: Dag the biologist setting down glass animals one by one, and now Maren could see what the baker couldn't, that each animal was a data specimen, that Dag was trying to preserve something, to smuggle evidence of contamination out through the only channel left to him. [490]

Then the teenager's nightmare: the captain reading from a blank book, and Maren understood now that the blankness was the point. [511] The pages had been erased. [515] Someone had wiped the ship's logs before the fire. [524]

And then a dream she hadn't catalogued — her own, arriving unbidden. [535] A woman she'd never met stood at the prow of the Astrid Lune, holding a candle against the dark, and turned to look directly at Maren with an expression that said: find me. [567]

Maren opened her eyes. [571] The candle flames had steadied, pointing straight up as though the glacier had finished exhaling. [584] She picked up the melted snow globe and turned it slowly in the light, watching the distorted village shimmer beneath its scarred dome. [604]

She would expose the truth — the contamination data, the sabotage, the names of those who burned a ship to bury evidence. [624] But she would do it carefully, threading each revelation through verified dream-patterns and recovered wreckage, building a case so precise that no one could dismiss it as the ravings of a woman who spoke to ghosts. [659]

Because what she wanted, what she had always wanted diving through the black water into broken hulls, was to salvage something pure from the wreckage. [683] Not treasure, not glory. [687] Just the clean, undeniable shape of what actually happened, held up to the light like glass. [702]

She wrapped the snow globe in cloth, blew out the nearest candle, and began the long walk out of the glacier, carrying borrowed starlight in her chest and forty-three whispered names on her tongue. [736]
