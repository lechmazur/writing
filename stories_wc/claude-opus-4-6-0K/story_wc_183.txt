The carnival ship had no name anymore, which was precisely why Maren had come looking for it. [17]

She stood at the rusted bow, watching fog curl like slow breath around the listing vessel, and pressed the emerald swatch card between her thumb and forefinger until its edges bit into skin. [48] The card had belonged to her sister — her twin, her other half, the one who had discovered what they were before Maren was ready to know. [73] Lina had held it up to the light in their mother's kitchen and said, "This is the exact green of the place where lost things go." [97] That was three years before she vanished, and two years before Maren understood that vanishing was something they were both built to do. [119]

They were chimera twins, two genomes braided into single bodies, carrying the cellular memory of siblings who never fully separated. [138] Lina had been the one to discover it — a routine blood test, then a deeper one, then the strange doctor with the stranger questions. [162] "You each carry traces of someone else," he'd said, as though that explained the way mirrors sometimes showed them faces that weren't quite their own. [186]

Now the carnival ship drifted in the foggy bay off Alcott Point, its Ferris wheel skeletal against the mist, its calliope pipes groaning with wind. [211] Maren walked the tilting midway, past booths where painted clowns peeled in long curls from rotting wood. [228] She felt the blissfully aberrant quality of this place — how it offered freedom while trapping you inside its slow decay, how it promised joy through the architecture of abandonment. [255] Trapped freedom: the ride that spins but never lets you off. [266]

She was here to find the Garden of Forgotten Names. [276]

Lina had written about it in her journals, which Maren had found in a storage unit after the disappearance. [294] Page after page described a place aboard this very ship — a greenhouse built into the aft deck where the carnival's fortune teller had once grown herbs and flowers, labeling each with a name pulled from the memories of paying customers. [332] Names of dead children, lost lovers, abandoned selves. [340] Lina believed that if she could find the garden, she could recapture something essential — the name of the person whose cells they carried, the unborn twin folded into their double helix. [367]

Maren moved through the ship's corridors, following Lina's directions through narrative threads she'd left woven into the journal entries. [385] Each entry was a story disguised as memory, and each story contained a hidden instruction: turn left at the hall of mirrors, descend past the flooding engine room, follow the smell of salt and soil. [418] As Maren read and walked, she noticed the memories themselves beginning to alter — she could no longer be certain which experiences were hers and which were Lina's. [445] Had she been the one who'd first held the emerald swatch card to the kitchen window? [460] Had she been the one to sit in the doctor's office, hearing the word chimera for the first time? [478]

The boundaries dissolved with each step deeper into the ship. [488]

She found the garden behind a door marked with a faded green diamond that matched the swatch card exactly. [506] Inside, the greenhouse glass was shattered in places, and fog poured through like something alive. [520] Dead plants stood in rows of clay pots, each bearing a small weathered tag. [533] Maren knelt and read them: Anna. [538] Solomon. [539] Blythe. [540] Wren. [541]

At the far end, one pot held a single living thing — a pale shoot, thin as thread, pushing through black soil. [561] Its tag was blank. [564]

Maren placed the emerald swatch card beside it and sat on the wet floor of the greenhouse, letting the fog settle around her like a shawl. [590] She understood now what Lina had been seeking: not a name, but the unkindled solace of knowing that some things remain alive precisely because they were never called into being. [618] The unnamed twin inside them was not a loss to be grieved but a presence that had always offered quiet comfort, a warmth that had never needed a spark because it had never gone out. [652]

She would not find Lina here. [658] But she would stop searching, and in that stopping, she would recapture something her sister had tried to give her all along: permission to carry mystery without needing to solve it. [688]

The ship rocked gently. [692] The fog pressed close. [696] Somewhere in the calliope pipes, the wind found a note that sounded almost like a name, and Maren let it pass through her without reaching for it. [725]

The pale shoot trembled once in a draft, then was still. [736]
