The carnival had been dead for eleven years, but Maren still came to the prize redemption center every Thursday, moving through the dust-filmed aisles of stuffed animals and plastic trinkets as though they were relics of a civilization she intended to resurrect. [43]

She was a liberator in chains — that was how she thought of herself, though she never said it aloud. [60] Once, she had been the region's foremost agricultural scientist, leading the effort to preserve drought-resistant seed varieties before the government declared such work a threat to corporate monoculture contracts. [87] They'd fitted her with a monitoring anklet, confined her to a twelve-block radius that happened to include this rotting fairground on the edge of town. [108] She could free the future, if only she could free herself first. [119]

But Maren was patiently strategic. [123] She had spent three years building what no one suspected existed beneath the prize redemption counter: a clandestine seed vault, temperature-controlled by a repurposed soft-serve machine whose compressor still hummed on a stolen solar line. [152] Inside it, two hundred and fourteen varieties of millet, sorghum, amaranth, and cowpea waited in vacuum-sealed pouches — each one chosen for its ability to plant resilience in dry soil, to make barren ground remember how to feed people. [189]

The problem was extraction. [193] When the wall comes down — she used that phrase privately, meaning the day the border barriers around the agricultural exclusion zone would be demolished for the new highway project — she would have a ninety-minute window to move the seeds south to the cooperative farms. [233] That day was seventeen days away. [239] She had a route, a driver, a destination. [247] What she did not have was the access code to the cargo elevator beneath the redemption center, the one that connected to the old service tunnels running under the fairground. [275]

The code, she believed, had been left for her by Dr. Ephram Solis, her former mentor, who had died in custody two years ago. [298] Before his arrest, Ephram had visited this carnival exactly once, winning a comically large stuffed bear and sitting at the battered upright piano near the skee-ball lanes. [324] He'd played nothing — just opened the bench, rearranged something inside, and left. [336]

Today, Maren finally pried the bench open. [343] Inside: piano keys. [346] Not on the keyboard — loose keys, eleven of them, ivory and ebony, laid out in a deliberate sequence along the velvet lining. [367] She recognized Ephram's method instantly. [372] By decoding the arrangement of keys left in a piano bench, mapping ivory as zero and ebony as one, reading the binary string he'd composed, she extracted an eight-digit number. [397] Her hands trembled only slightly as she punched it into the elevator panel behind the counter. [412]

The door sighed open. [416]

Below, the tunnel was cool, dry, perfect. [423] She moved the first rack of seed pouches onto a rolling cart and permitted herself one breath of gratitude so large it buckled her knees. [446]

On the second trip down, she found it leaning against the tunnel wall: an arrow with strange fletching, its vanes made not of feather but of tightly rolled paper. [475] She unspooled one strip and found Ephram's handwriting: "They will try to impede you at the south gate. [492] Go east through the drainage culvert at marker 7. [501] I am sorry I could not walk beside you." [509]

She pressed the paper to her sternum and breathed. [518] He had planned for obstacles she hadn't foreseen, had left corrections for a journey he would never make, had fletched a literal arrow to point her way — and the staggering grace of it, the quiet enormity of one person's faith threaded through years and walls and death, nearly undid her. [562]

But she was patiently strategic. [567] She re-rolled the paper, tucked it into her coat, and continued loading seeds. [579]

Seventeen days later, the wall came down in a grinding avalanche of concrete and rebar. [593] Maren moved east through the drainage culvert at marker seven, the cart rattling ahead of her, two hundred and fourteen varieties of the future packed in darkness. [620]

Behind her, the monitoring anklet lay on the prize counter beside a row of dusty plastic trophies, its clasp opened by a hairpin she'd been carrying for eleven years, waiting for exactly this moment. [652]

She reached the cooperative at dawn. [658] The farmers were already there, hands open, soil ready. [667] She knelt and pressed the first seeds into the cracked earth with fingers that shook — not from fear, but from the staggering grace of finally becoming what she had always been. [697]

A liberator, unchained. [700]
