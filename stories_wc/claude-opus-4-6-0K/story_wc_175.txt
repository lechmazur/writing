She had climbed above the cloudline to find the grotto, and now that she stood within it, Maren understood why no cartographer had ever marked it on a map. [30]

The place did not want to be remembered. [38]

Moss clung to limestone walls in curtains of impossible green, fed by mist that rose from the clouds below and condensed against the cold rock. [63] Ferns older than any living nation unfurled from crevices, and the light that filtered through the opening overhead was pale and shy, as though embarrassed to intrude. [90] Everything here held itself in a state of blushing stillness, the kind of quiet that comes not from absence but from reverence. [110]

Maren set down her pack and removed the wooden frame she had carried for three days up the mountain. [130] She was an esoteric realist, a term she had invented for herself because no existing title fit. [147] She believed that the invisible forces shaping human life -- grief, forgetting, the slow erosion of meaning from names no one speaks anymore -- were as concrete as stone, and could be addressed with equally concrete methods. [180] Her method was building temporary structures as signals, small architectures placed in landscapes where something true had been lost, designed to catch the attention of whatever consciousness might still be listening. [209]

She had come during the migration of the last monarch butterfly because the timing mattered. [224] Not the last migration -- scientists still debated that -- but the migration of the last confirmed monarch, a single female tagged in Ontario and tracked by satellite as she flew south toward a wintering ground that no longer existed. [260] The butterfly's path would arc near this grotto tonight, passing through the thin corridor between two peaks where the air was warm enough to sustain her. [288] Maren wanted to be ready. [293]

She began assembling the frame, lashing crosspieces with cord. [302] Her fingers worked the rope into a series of knots, each one deliberate, each one a word in a vocabulary she had spent years developing. [325] A bowline for remembrance. [329] A clove hitch for passage. [334] A figure-eight for the interrupted cadence of lives that ended mid-sentence, stories broken off before their resolution, histories that never reached the tonic note. [358]

Interrupted cadence -- that was what haunted her. [366] Not tragedy, not catastrophe, but the unbearable suspension of things left unfinished. [378] The monarch would not arrive at her ancestral grove because the grove had been cleared for soybean. [393] She would fly the shape of a journey that no longer had a destination. [406] And no one would build a monument to that. [415]

From a small glass vial, Maren withdrew a single moth wing, translucent and veined like a cathedral window. [432] She had found it years ago on the floor of a shuttered textile mill in Massachusetts, a place where women once worked looms by gaslight, their names scraped from every record. [462] She fixed the wing to the apex of her structure with thread so fine it disappeared in the light. [480] The wing trembled in the updraft from the clouds, catching the last warmth of the sun. [496]

She was transiently rooted here, as she was everywhere. [506] She would stay one night, perhaps two, then descend and leave the structure to weather and wind. [523] It was not meant to last. [529] None of her signals were. [534] They existed only long enough to be seen by whatever needed to see them, and then they returned to the earth, as all honest things eventually do. [562]

The light dimmed. [565] Maren sat cross-legged on the moss and waited. [574] Below her, the clouds turned the color of a healing bruise, purple and gold and tender. [590] The ferns curled slightly inward, as if settling in to listen. [601]

She did not see the monarch pass. [608] She might have been looking the wrong direction, or the butterfly might have altered course, or the satellite data might have been hours old. [632] But sometime in the deep middle of the night, Maren woke to find the moth wing turning slowly on its thread, animated by a breath of air that had not been there before. [665]

She did not smile. [669] She did not weep. [674] She simply watched the wing rotate in the darkness above the clouds, a small and temporary thing honoring all the overlooked histories that had accumulated in the world like sediment, like moss, like silence waiting to be heard. [710]

In the morning she would undo the knots. [719] She would collapse the frame and carry it down the mountain. [730] The grotto would close around the space where the structure had stood, and the ferns would unfurl over the impression her body had left in the moss. [758]

But for now, the wing turned, and the cadence hung suspended, and the stillness blushed, and that was enough. [776]
