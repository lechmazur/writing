Maren had always been a reckless idealist, the kind of woman who believed broken things wanted to be whole again if you simply asked them the right question. [27] That conviction had led her underground, past the iron gate and down the crumbling stairs, into the catacomb orchard where tree roots snaked between bones and the air tasted of loam and quiet centuries. [56]

She carried a lantern that gave the half-lit corridors their amber glow, turning femurs into gilded columns and ribcages into strange lattice windows. [76] Somewhere ahead, water dripped in a rhythm that sounded almost deliberate, almost like speech. [88] She followed it. [91]

The orchard had been planted by monks three hundred years ago, their fruit trees set above the ossuary so the roots could feed on the consecrated dead. [116] Now the trees had grown monstrous and blind, trunks splitting stone, their pale fruit hanging in clusters that no one harvested. [135] Maren reached up and touched one, cool and firm beneath her palm, and felt the faintest pulse of something not quite life. [155]

She was here to patch holes in the soul — her own and others'. [168] That was how the dealer at the surface market had described what was possible below, his voice low, his table spread with relics. [190] He had sold her a burned tarot card, its edges curled black, the image barely visible: a figure standing at a crossroads, half its body eaten by flame. [217] The Barter, he called it. [222] A card from a lost deck, used once in a ritual of bartered destinies, where one person's future could be traded for another's past, where grief could be exchanged for purpose and emptiness swapped for burden. [253]

She needed it because her daughter, Lise, had been hollowed out by something no doctor could name. [269] At seventeen, Lise had stopped dreaming, stopped wanting, stopped filling space with her voice. [282] It was as though someone had reached inside her and scooped away the raw material of desire. [296] Maren, fiercely gentle in the way only desperate mothers can be, had refused to accept it as permanent. [313] She would descend into any underworld. [319] She would barter anything. [323]

The corridor opened into a vaulted chamber where roots formed a canopy overhead, threaded through skulls like fingers laced in prayer. [342] At its center stood a stone basin filled with black water that reflected no light. [356] Maren knelt. [358] She placed the burned tarot card on the water's surface and watched it float, impossibly, the charred figure seeming to breathe. [377]

The method was what the dealer had explained most carefully: inlaying meaning everywhere. [389] Every gesture had to carry intent. [395] Every word had to be both literal and symbolic. [403] She spoke her daughter's name aloud and meant by it every morning Lise had ever woken laughing. [419] She placed her own hand in the water and meant by it every night she had stayed awake listening to Lise breathe. [439] She closed her eyes and meant by it trust — trust that the dark was not empty but full of unseen architecture. [458]

The water trembled. [461] Something moved beneath the surface, vast and considered. [469] Maren felt her own memories begin to loosen, not vanishing but rearranging, as though the roots above were reaching into her mind the way they reached into bone. [494] She understood then what the barter cost: her certainty, her stubborn belief that she knew best, the very recklessness that had brought her here. [516] The exchange would trammel her — bind her wild hope into something quieter, more ordinary, a life of small doubts and careful steps. [537] In return, Lise would wake tomorrow with the raw, aching capacity to want things again. [551]

Maren opened her eyes. [555] The burned card had sunk. [560] The figure at the crossroads was gone, absorbed into whatever ancient economy operated here among the roots and relics. [577] She felt the change already settling into her chest, a heaviness where lightness had been, a patience she had never possessed. [596]

She picked up her lantern. [601] The half-lit corridor stretched ahead, and she walked it slowly, a different woman now, dusky resolve hardening in her like amber around an insect. [624] She had traded the brilliant, fragile thing inside her for her daughter's restoration, and she did not regret it. [643] Above her, roots held the dead in a long embrace, and somewhere far above that, Lise would soon open her eyes to a morning thick with possibility. [670]

Maren climbed the stairs into ordinary light. [677] She did not look back. [682] The orchard kept its silence, the bones kept their patience, and the dark water settled into stillness, waiting for the next desperate soul brave enough to descend and ask the right question. [712]
