She had been cataloguing the small lives of tidal pools for eleven years, and in that time Maren had learned that everything important happens in the in-between. [28]

The grotto opened like a stone mouth above the shoreline, its ceiling worn away in places so that starlight fell through in scattered columns. [51] At low tide, the rock floor held dozens of pools, each one a kingdom unto itself, and Maren knew them all by heart. [73] She knew which anemones had survived the last storm, which hermit crabs had traded shells, which algae bloomed only during the equinox tides when the water neither advanced nor retreated but simply held its breath. [104]

Tonight she was not alone. [109]

Dao sat across the widest pool from her, his boots dark with saltwater, his hands resting on his knees. [129] He had come from the university with questions about her journals, her decades of meticulous observation, but the conversation had reached a place neither of them had expected. [156]

"You're saying the funding is gone," Maren said. [164]

"I'm saying it was never renewed." [170]

The silence that followed was not empty. [177] It was a transition, the kind Maren recognized from years of watching--the slack water between tides, the molt between one shell and another, the breath a creature holds before it commits to moving. [208]

She reached into her coat pocket and felt the jade cicada there, smooth and cool, its wings folded tight. [227] Her grandmother had pressed it into her palm when Maren was nine, saying that cicadas understood waiting better than any other living thing. [250] They spent years underground, patient in darkness, and then emerged into a world that had changed around them. [268] Maren had carried it every day since, not as a talisman but as a reminder that time had texture--rough seasons and smooth ones, dense passages and gaps so thin you could see through them. [300]

She turned the jade figure in her fingers and looked at Dao. [312] He was watching the pool between them, where a small blenny darted between rocks, and she noticed that his expression was not bureaucratic. [333] It was grieved. [336]

"You came all this way to tell me in person," she said, warmly observant enough to read what his posture confessed. [356]

"I read every volume of your chronicle," he said. [365] "The way you describe transitions--the hours between storm and calm, the minutes when one species yields territory to another. [382] I've never seen anyone write about time that way. [391] As though it has grain, like wood." [398]

"It does." [400]

She held up the jade cicada so starlight caught its carved wings. [412] "My grandmother used to say you can't understand a cicada by studying the song or the silence. [428] You have to study the moment the song begins." [437]

Dao leaned forward. [440] "That's exactly what your work does." [447]

"Then you understand why I can't stop." [454]

The pause resumed, but it had changed shape. [462] Maren could foresee, through a kind of tangential approach that had always served her better than direct confrontation, how this might unfold. [481] She would not argue for her funding. [488] She would not present data or cite publications. [495] Instead, she would do what she had always done: show him a transition in progress and let it speak. [513]

"Come here," she said, and moved to a shallow pool near the grotto's eastern wall where three shafts of starlight converged. [534] In the water, a shore crab was mid-molt, its old carapace splitting along the back seam, the soft new body emerging pale and vulnerable. [557] It would take minutes. [561] Neither of them spoke as they watched. [568]

The crab freed itself and stood trembling in its new skin, larger than before, tender to every current. [585]

"That," Maren whispered, "is the texture of time. [593] That moment is what my chronicles record. [600] Not the before, not the after, but the passage itself--the part most people look away from because it is too fragile to bear watching." [621]

Dao was quiet for a long moment. [628] Then he said, "I didn't come only to deliver bad news. [639] I came because I want to help you find another way." [650]

Maren set the jade cicada on the rock between them, its wings aimed at the stars. [666] The tide was turning. [670] She could feel it in the faint pull of water around her boots, the ancient grotto breathing in. [687]

"Then watch with me," she said. [693] "That's where it always starts." [699]
