The carousel halted on a Tuesday, or what Maren believed was a Tuesday, though she had long since lost the ability to place days in their proper sequence. [27] The great iron wheel that once churned the lagoon's currents ground to silence, and the water above the clouds settled into something almost like peace, though peace was too whole a word for what remained. [56] Fractured stillness -- that was closer. [61] The surface still rippled from memories of motion, small kinetic pulses traveling outward from the dead carousel's base, but the roar was gone. [80]

Maren adjusted the strap of her salvage bag and stepped along the stone lip of the lagoon, where mist curled upward from a world she could no longer see below. [107] She was a scavenger, had always been a scavenger, though the order of her scavenging confused her. [123] Had she picked the cloud-reefs first, or the drowned pavilions? [132] Had the carousel still been spinning when she arrived, or had it already begun its long deceleration? [147] She couldn't say. [150] Time folded in on itself here, and she moved through her own history like someone shuffling a deck of cards in the dark. [171]

What she knew, with the stubbornness that had kept her alive, was the task. [184] She was looking for fragments. [189] Not metal, not wire, not the usual refuse of a kinetic system winding down, but stories. [203] Overheard stories. [205] They clung to objects the way barnacles clung to submerged hulls, and if you pressed the right thing to your ear, you could hear them -- whispers left behind by everyone who had ever passed through the lagoon. [240]

Today she had found a disposable camera wheel, the small grooved thumbscrew that advanced the film. [254] It had been wedged between two stones near the carousel's outermost ring, half-corroded by cloud-salt. [268] She held it between her fingers and listened. [276]

A man's voice, thin and distant: "She said she'd photograph every city on the coast before she turned thirty." [292] Then a woman, laughing bitterly: "That was before the funding collapsed, before everything collapsed." [305] Then silence, then the man again, quieter: "She stopped carrying the camera after that. Said the lens made promises the world wouldn't keep." [326]

Maren closed her hand around the wheel. [333] The regret hit her sideways, as it always did, not as a single blow but as a slow recognition -- these were her stories. [353] Her eroded ambitions, scattered across the lagoon in the mouths of strangers who had somehow carried pieces of her life without knowing it. [373] She had wanted to be a photographer once, hadn't she? [383] Or was that next? [387] Was that something she hadn't done yet? [394] The chronology slipped again, greased and unreliable, and she pressed her palm to her forehead as if she could physically hold the timeline in place. [416]

It didn't matter. [419] What mattered was the ghost. [424]

She had first seen it three stops ago -- or three stops from now, she couldn't be certain -- standing at the far edge of the lagoon where the water thinned to vapor. [451] It wore her face, younger, unscarred by cloud-salt, holding a camera that still had film in it. [467] It was the version of her that had not yet let every ambition erode to silt. [481] And Maren needed to speak with it, to negotiate some kind of truce between who she had been and who she had become. [501]

She followed the lagoon's edge as the last kinetic pulses faded beneath her boots. [514] The fragments she had collected over weeks -- or was it years? -- rattled softly in her bag: a hairpin that whispered about a scholarship she'd abandoned, a bolt that murmured about a lover she'd left at the wrong altitude, a ticket stub that recalled the exact moment she had decided survival was enough and ambition was a luxury. [564] Each fragment was evidence, a bargaining chip for the negotiation ahead. [575]

The ghost stood where it always stood, at the edge where cloud became nothing. [588] It turned as Maren approached, and its eyes held no accusation, only a question. [601]

Maren set her bag down. [606] She placed the camera wheel on the stone between them like an offering, like a confession. [620] "I know what we wanted," she said, her voice raw from the thin air. [634] "I know what got lost. I'm not here to apologize for that." [645]

The ghost tilted its head. [650]

"I'm here to ask what's worth wanting now." [658]

The lagoon, for the first time since the carousel halted, was truly still. [670] The ghost knelt, picked up the small grooved wheel, and turned it once between fingers that were almost solid. [686] Film advancing. [688] A small, resolute click. [692]

Then it spoke, and what it said rearranged every fragment Maren carried, shuffled the deck one final time, and laid the cards face-up in an order she could almost, almost, read. [722]
