The lighthouse had not guided a ship in eleven years, but Mei-Ling Chen still climbed its spiral stairs every evening and turned on the light. [24]

She told herself it was habit, the way her fingers still folded paper slips into perfect rectangles, the way her mind still compressed entire futures into twelve words or fewer. [53] For twenty-three years she had written fortunes for the Golden Happiness Cookie Company out of a rented room in Portland, and for nine of those years she had also been embedding spycraft microdot film specs into the ink of every seventh cookie on the Szechuan Dragon line. [100] The specifications traveled in plain sight, tucked inside cellophane, cracked open by strangers in suburban restaurants who laughed at their fortunes and never once examined the period at the end of the sentence under magnification. [134] Open secrets, her handler had called them. [140] The best kind. [143]

The strange thing--the thing that had eventually unraveled everything--was that her fortunes kept coming true. [158]

Not the microdot intelligence, which was dry and technical and concerned submarine hull composites. [171] The fortunes themselves. [174] "A unexpected journey begins where the road bends twice." [183] A diplomat's car broke down at a double switchback outside Geneva, and he walked into a farmhouse where he met his future wife, who happened to be an asset. [212] "The river does not ask permission to change course." [221] Written three days before a dam collapse in Jiangxi province redirected the Xiu River and exposed a buried military installation. [237] Accidentally prophetic, every time, as though the universe read her slips and took notes. [251]

After last orders came down from Langley--the program dissolved, her handler reassigned, her stipend canceled with a form letter that thanked her for her "creative contributions"--Mei-Ling bought the decommissioned lighthouse on Vashon Rock for less than the price of a sedan. [293] The rocky island sat in Puget Sound like a fist of basalt, reachable only by a boat she kept chained at the mainland dock. [317] She brought her pens, her paper cutter, her reading lamp. [327] She brought the last canister of microdot film specs, which she had never returned because no one had asked. [344]

She wanted to transpose her life into a new key. [354] The same notes, perhaps, but in a different register--minor where it had been major, contemplative where it had been covert. [373] She still wrote fortunes every morning at the kitchen table beneath the lighthouse tower, but now she wrote them for no company, no agency, no one. [397] She folded them and placed them in glass bottles and set them in the current. [412]

By directing flow--of tide, of attention, of meaning--she began to orchestrate something she could not entirely name. [428] The bottles moved predictably; she had studied the Sound's circulation patterns the way she once studied dead-drop schedules. [445] Certain bottles reached the ferry terminal. [451] Others washed up at the marina in Burton, or the beach at Point Robinson where families picnicked on Sundays. [467] People found them, read them, posted photographs online. [475] A small following developed. [479] Someone called her the Oracle of Vashon Rock. [488]

And the fortunes kept coming true. [494]

"What is hidden in the foundation will surface in the flood." [504] A week later, heavy rains exposed a cache of prohibition-era whiskey beneath the old schoolhouse. [518] "The keeper of the light sees farthest when she stops looking." [528] Mei-Ling herself found that one crumpled in her own handwriting, washed back to her shore by some tidal joke, and she sat on the rocks for a long time holding it. [560]

She understood now that the prophecy was never hers. [570] She was the lighthouse: a mechanism for directing flow, a structure that revealed what was already there. [585] The open secret of the world was that it wanted to be known, that truth moved like water toward the lowest point, that you could hide submarine specs in cookie ink and still the fortune printed above it would matter more. [623]

One evening she climbed the stairs and opened the canister of microdot film specs for the first time in years. [642] Under magnification, the submarine composites looked like constellations. [650] She smiled, cut the film into tiny squares, and pressed one into the period of each new fortune. [667] Let someone find them. [671] Let someone hold the slip to the light and see the hidden architecture of a life she had left behind, nested inside a prediction about kindness, or weather, or the strange persistence of hope. [700]

She sealed the bottles. [704] She set them in the current. [710] The lighthouse turned its beam across the dark water, illuminating nothing it could keep, and Mei-Ling Chen descended the spiral stairs into the familiar enigma of another night, the tide pulling her words toward strangers who would crack them open and believe.
