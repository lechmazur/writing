The hanging orchard swayed in the ravine like something half-remembered, its trees rooted in terraced shelves of rock and tethered by cables that sang in the wind. [27] Maren moved among them with the sureness of someone who had long stopped fearing the drop. [43] She was a truffle forager by trade - rational, methodical, reading the soil the way others once read faces, back before faces became unbearable to look at. [69]

After the empathy virus, everyone became involuntarily truthful. [77] Not just in speech but in presence - every hidden shame, every buried grief radiated outward like heat from a wound. [97] Cities emptied. [99] People couldn't stand to be near each other. [107] The virus didn't kill. [111] It simply made honesty inescapable, and that turned out to be worse than most plagues. [126]

Maren had retreated to the ravine three years ago. [135] The storms that battered the orchard suited her. [143] Wind and rain occluded things - sound, sight, the constant low hum of another person's unguarded interior. [159] Here, among the gnarled apple trees and the fungal networks threading through their roots, she could almost pretend she was alone with only her own truths. [185] Those were hard enough. [189]

She knelt in the rain-softened earth and pressed her fingers into the loam, feeling for the firmness that signaled truffles below. [210] The rational mind was her anchor. [216] Mycelium followed patterns. [219] Spore dispersal obeyed physics. [223] In a world where every human interaction had become a kind of wound, she found psychological safety in the logic of fungi. [245]

But people found her anyway. [250] They always did. [253]

The woman arrived at the ravine's edge during the worst storm of the season, half-dragged by the wind, clutching a leather satchel against her chest. [278] Maren felt her before she saw her - a wash of desperate hope so raw it made Maren's teeth ache. [297]

"I was told you have it," the woman said, not bothering with introduction. [310] After the virus, pleasantries were pointless. [316] Everyone already knew what everyone meant. [322] "The glass eye." [325]

Maren pulled a truffle from the earth and brushed it clean. [336] She didn't answer immediately, though she couldn't lie. [344] That was the cruelty of the condition - silence was the only refuge, and even that was thin. [361]

"I have it," she said, because the truth pressed itself out like sap from a cut branch. [378] "But it won't do what you think." [385]

The antique glass eye was a smuggled relic from a Czech monastery, passed hand to hand through networks of the desperate. [406] Maren had found reference to it through rumored cures in discredited textbooks - volumes on sympathetic medicine, on objects that could absorb or redirect psychic contagion. [431] The old science, laughed at before the virus, studied frantically after. [442] She'd traded two seasons of high-grade truffles to a broker in the lowlands to acquire it. [458]

It sat in a tin box in her shelter, wrapped in cloth: a sphere of hand-blown glass with an iris painted the color of storm clouds, veined with fractures that caught light like something alive. [493] It was beautiful in the way broken things sometimes are. [503]

"It doesn't cure you," Maren said. [509] She stood, feeling the woman's hope curdle into something more complex. [520] "It helps you occlude. [524] That's all. [526] You hold it, you focus on it, and for a while the broadcast dims. [540] You're still truthful. [543] You still feel everything. [547] But others can't read you as easily." [554]

"That's enough," the woman whispered. [559]

Maren understood. [561] Psychological safety wasn't about becoming numb or becoming false again. [571] It was about choosing what to share. [578] The virus had stolen consent. [583] Every emotion was public. [587] The glass eye, this strange relic with no scientific basis, offered something the rational mind couldn't: a door you could partially close. [609]

She led the woman down the cable paths to her shelter, where the orchard groaned and swayed above them. [628] Inside, she unwrapped the eye and placed it in the woman's palm. [640] The woman's broadcast flickered, dimmed - not gone, but gentled. [649]

"How long does it last?" [654]

"A few hours." [657] "Sometimes less." [659]

"And then?" [661]

"You come back." [664] "Or you learn to build the feeling without it." [673]

The woman closed her fingers around the glass eye, and for the first time since arriving, her presence softened into something Maren could stand beside without aching. [700] They sat together in the storm-rocked shelter, two involuntarily honest people practicing the fractured grace of partial silence, while the wind moved through the hanging orchard like breath through a broken instrument, making music that was imperfect, and therefore bearable, and therefore true. [743]
