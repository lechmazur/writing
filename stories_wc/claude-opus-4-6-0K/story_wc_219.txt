The signal had arrived eleven days ago, a pulse from Gliese 667C that unmade every assumption about solitude in the universe, and Dr. Sera Voss had spent each of those days refusing to weep like her colleagues. [37]

She was what the department called a luminous skeptic -- someone whose doubt carried its own warmth, whose challenges to consensus shone rather than stung. [60] For years she had been academically rebellious in the quietest way: publishing papers that dismantled the sentimentality around nostalgia, arguing that homecoming was not a spiritual phenomenon but a cascade of oxytocin, cortisol, and spatial memory folding back on itself. [97] Her peers found her reductive. [102] Her students found her honest. [107] Now, after making first contact -- after learning that something out there had been listening longer than anyone imagined -- Sera found herself driving three hundred kilometers to a place she had not visited in nine years. [141]

The tower stood at the edge of the old campus, rainwashed and pearl-gray in the spring light. [157] It had been a meteorological station once, then a graduate studio, then nothing. [170] Ivy latticed the lower windows. [175] Rain had left the limestone clean but streaked, as though the building had been crying carefully for a long time. [192]

She parked on the gravel shoulder and opened her palm. [202] In it sat a teardrop of fly amber, honey-dark, a single Diptera caught mid-wing-beat forty million years ago. [219] Her mentor, Dr. Linden, had pressed it into her hand the last time she stood here. [234] "Proof," he had said, "that the world preserves what it loves without asking permission." [247] Linden was dead now, three winters gone. [254] The amber was warm from her grip. [261]

What she was doing, she understood clinically, was an artificial pilgrimage. [272] She had designed it that way: deliberate return, measured steps, controlled variables. [283] She wore the same boots she had worn as a graduate student. [294] She carried the same satchel. [299] She wanted to isolate the chemistry of homecoming, to know whether the feeling could be manufactured and, if so, whether it still meant anything after the sky had opened and revealed that humanity was not alone. [333]

The sculpture path began at the north end of the quad, a flagstone trail lined with student-carved figures now throttled by moss and wild garlic. [358] No one walked here anymore. [363] But as Sera moved along it, she noticed dusty footprints already pressed into the stone -- her own, from an hour earlier, when she had scouted the route in a daze and forgotten she had done so. [397] The prints converged with her current stride perfectly, as though past and present were lining up their spines. [414]

She followed them. [417]

Bronze quiet settled over everything: the hush of wet metal, the low hum of a world pausing between breaths. [434] Finches muttered in the hedgerow. [439] Water dripped from a sandstone angel's outstretched hand. [447] Sera's heart rate was elevated -- she checked her wrist monitor -- and her cortisol was spiking in exactly the pattern her own papers predicted. [467] Homecoming was performing on schedule. [473]

Yet something exceeded the data. [478]

At the tower door she stopped. [484] The handle was rusted but turned. [490] Inside, the spiral stair still smelled of chalk dust and rain. [501] She climbed to the observation room, where Linden had first shown her the Gliese system through a telescope now sold for parts. [521] The windows framed a green valley trembling with wind. [531]

She set the fly amber on the sill. [539] Light moved through it and cast a small golden eye on the floor, the ancient insect's silhouette trembling as clouds shifted. [558] Forty million years of stillness, and the fly still looked mid-flight. [569]

Sera pressed her forehead to the cold glass. [578] Out there, impossibly far, something had sent a word. [588] In here, impossibly close, her blood was answering a place. [599] The chemistry was correct -- every ion accounted for -- and still the sum exceeded the parts. [614] She had come to prove that homecoming was mechanical, reproducible, artificial, and she had proven it. [628] The hormones matched. [631] The neural pathways fired on cue. [637]

But standing in Linden's tower, holding his amber, watching spring rain begin again against glass that had outlasted him, she understood that knowing the mechanism did not diminish the ache. [665] It deepened it. [668] A signal from the stars had taught her that presence does not require proximity, that something can reach across void and still arrive warm. [690]

She picked up the amber, held it to the light once more, and let the luminous skeptic in her do what skeptics rarely do. [713]

She believed it anyway. [717]

The rain fell. [720] The tower held. [723] The fly hung in its golden world, perfect, preserved, going nowhere and everywhere at once, the smallest pilgrim she had ever known. [746]
