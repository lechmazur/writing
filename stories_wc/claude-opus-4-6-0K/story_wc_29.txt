Maren Soloway had not slept in four days, and the university radio station smelled like burnt coffee and ozone, which she took as confirmation that something was very wrong with the sky. [31]

She was the only celestial signal interpreter left at Hargrove University who hadn't joined one of the two factions now tearing the astronomy department apart. [55] Half the faculty believed the anomalous transmissions from the Cygnus region were evidence of intelligent contact, a breakthrough worth announcing to the world. [75] The other half called it interference, cosmic noise, meaningless static dressed up by desperate academics chasing grant money. [91] As the community divided along these bitter lines, Maren sat alone in the basement broadcast booth of WHGV 91.3, surrounded by astronomical charts she'd pinned to every available surface, and listened to what neither side wanted to hear. [124]

The signals were intelligent, yes. [129] But they were not friendly. [134]

She'd first noticed the pattern three weeks ago, buried in the subsonic frequencies that most interpreters filtered out as irrelevant background hum. [155] Standard practice dismissed anything below twenty hertz. [162] Maren had not followed standard practice since she was nineteen and had caught a pulsar signature everyone else had missed during an undergraduate lab. [184] That discovery had earned her a cautiously hopeful reputation: brilliant but unproven, the kind of mind that might be visionary or might be chasing ghosts. [207] Now, at thirty-one, she was fairly certain she was chasing something that was chasing them back. [223]

The subsonic layer of the Cygnus transmissions contained a recursive structure, a signal nested inside a signal, like a voice whispering beneath a scream. [246] When she mapped it against her astronomical charts, the pattern corresponded to known coordinates of deep-space observation arrays across six continents. [266] Someone, or something, was cataloging exactly where humanity was looking and adjusting its broadcast to exploit those blind spots. [283] The transmissions weren't a greeting. [288] They were a test, probing which frequencies humans monitored and which they ignored, learning the architecture of their attention. [305]

Cosmic tricksters. [307] That was the term her old mentor, Dr. Yuen, had used before his retirement, half-joking, about hypothetical intelligences that might communicate not to connect but to manipulate. [331] Power plays conducted across light-years. [337] Maren had laughed then. [341] She was not laughing now. [346]

The department war made everything worse. [352] Dr. Asante's contact faction wanted to broadcast a response. [361] Dr. Lund's skeptic faction wanted to shut the array down entirely and publish a debunking paper. [376] Both moves, Maren realized with a cold knot in her stomach, were exactly what the tricksters seemed to be engineering. [395] A response would confirm humanity's detection capabilities and listening coordinates. [403] A shutdown would create silence, a gap in coverage the signals were already mapping. [416] Either outcome served the same intelligence on the other end. [426]

She had to interfere. [430]

Not with the signals themselves but with the human decisions forming around them. [442] Maren pulled the station microphone closer and opened a campus-wide broadcast channel, something she technically had authority to do as a faculty affiliate with booth access, though no one had ever actually done it at two in the morning. [479]

She laid out the evidence methodically, reading coordinates from her charts, playing the subsonic frequencies boosted into audible range so listeners could hear the recursive structure for themselves. [507] She explained the probe logic, the blind-spot mapping, the way both factions were being played against each other by a pattern older and more patient than any tenure dispute. [535] Her voice carried that quality her students sometimes remarked on, steady but raw, as though she were describing something beautiful that could kill you. [558]

She did not claim certainty. [563] She said: here is what I see, here is what I fear, here is what I cautiously hope we are still smart enough to do about it. [586] She proposed a third option, a coordinated, randomized rotation of monitoring frequencies across all arrays, a response that revealed nothing, confirmed nothing, but kept watch. [611] Outwit them by refusing to be predictable. [618]

The broadcast ended. [621] Maren sat in the hum of dead air, charts rustling in the ventilation draft, and waited. [637]

At 2:47 a.m., Dr. Asante called the station phone. [646] At 2:51, Dr. Lund emailed. [651] Neither agreed with the other. [656] Both wanted to talk to her. [662]

Maren poured the last of the burnt coffee, studied the charts once more, and felt something she hadn't felt in weeks: the fragile, gritty edge of hope, like starlight filtered through smoke. [694] The tricksters were patient, but so was she. [703] And she had one advantage they hadn't accounted for. [712]

She knew they were watching. [717]
