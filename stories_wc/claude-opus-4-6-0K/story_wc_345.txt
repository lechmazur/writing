The orchard planet had no name that anyone remembered, only the feeling it left in your chest — a tightness like fruit not yet ripe, a sweetness threatening to arrive. [31]

Beneath its lavender sky, trees grew sideways through floating rock arches, their roots threading stone like stitches through torn cloth. [50] Gravity here was a suggestion, not a law, and the orchards hung at impossible angles, dripping nectar into the clouds below. [71] Among the settlers who had crash-landed three years prior, the planet was simply called Respite — their nebula of respite, the star charts had labeled this region, and the name had stuck to the ground itself. [102]

No one remembered exactly when Maren died. [109] She had been the colony's first volunteer medic, the one who rationed her own water so children could drink, who sutured wounds with thread pulled from her own clothing. [136] The crash had taken forty-three lives in the first week, and Maren's was among them, though her body was never found beneath the wreckage. [160] What was found, the morning after her memorial, was a message chalked onto the deserted sidewalk of their fledgling settlement at dawn: THE EASTERN ARCH IS CRACKING. [185] MOVE THE SEEDLINGS BEFORE THIRD-LIGHT. [191]

They moved the seedlings. [195] The arch collapsed at noon. [200]

After that, the chalk messages appeared regularly, always before sunrise, always on paths no one walked at that hour. [218] REDIRECT THE IRRIGATION CANAL SOUTH. [223] THE ROOT ROT STARTS IN QUADRANT SEVEN. [230] TELL PASCAL HIS DAUGHTER FORGIVES HIM. [236]

It was Pascal who first said it aloud, his voice cracking like dry wood: "It's Maren." [252] No one argued. [255] Her handwriting was unmistakable — left-leaning, cramped, every letter formed with the urgency of someone who had too much to say and too little time. [278] A ghost, then. [281] An altruistic ghost who had refused to stop serving even after her own breath had ended. [295]

The strange thing was how completely they trusted her. [304] Not immediately, not without doubt, but the messages proved strangely trustworthy in ways that dissolved skepticism like sugar in rain. [322] Every warning was accurate. [326] Every instruction, when followed, yielded survival. [332] After strangers become family — after shared hunger and shared grief forge bonds no blood could match — trust is not given; it is grown, root by root, through stone. [360]

And Maren was growing something. [365]

The messages shifted from warnings to blueprints. [372] She was asking them to reexamine the way they'd been farming — not just surviving, but cultivating. [388] BUILD A BUTTERFLY GARDEN, one message read. [395] USE THE COPPER BELL FOR WATERING. [401] THEY NEED THE VIBRATION AS MUCH AS THE MOISTURE. [410]

Old Tuva found the butterfly garden watering bell in the wreckage, a copper instrument meant for some Earth greenhouse, its rim green with patina. [434] When struck and filled and tipped, it sang a tone that drew the planet's native pollinators — creatures not quite butterflies, not quite light, that pulsed through the arches like scattered heartbeats. [465] Without them, the orchards would eventually fail. [472] Maren had known. [475] Even dead, she was thinking further ahead than any of them. [486]

Her motivation became clear as the messages grew longer, more complex, sprawling across entire walkways in pale blue and yellow chalk. [505] She was orchestrating collective effort — not just advising individuals, but weaving the colony into a single organism. [522] Pascal managed irrigation. [525] Tuva tended the butterfly garden. [530] The children mapped the floating arches, charting which ones were stable, which were dying. [544] Every person had a role written for them in chalk at dawn, and every role interlocked with every other. [562]

Brambled hope — that's what Tuva called it when asked how she felt. [574] "Like reaching into a thornbush because you can see the fruit." [585] The scratches were real. [589] The grief was real. [593] The fact that their best leader was dead and could only speak in chalk dust on cooling stone — that was real too. [614]

But the fruit was ripening. [619]

On the morning the first true harvest came in, no message appeared on the sidewalks. [634] Instead, chalked across the great central arch that curved over the settlement like a cathedral ceiling, in letters large enough to read from any doorway, were two words in Maren's unmistakable hand: [666]

WELL DONE. [668]

Pascal wept. [670] Tuva rang the copper bell, and the not-quite-butterflies rose in a spiral through the arch, carrying light upward into the lavender sky. [693] Somewhere unseen, Maren was still tending them — still reaching through the thorns, still believing the harvest would come. [712]

It had. [714]
