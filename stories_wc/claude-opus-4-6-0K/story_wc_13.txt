Maren had spent eleven years illustrating the anatomy of vanishing things--the jawbone of the last river wolf, the translucent wings of moths that lived only in moonlight--but she had never tried to draw a sound. [36]

Now she crouched in her narrowboat, drifting through the rooftop canal system that wove between the city's thousand towers, and sketched furiously as another echo rolled across the water. [62] Not the echo of anything. [67] That was the trouble. [71] These echoes had no origin, no parent sound. [79] They rippled through the elevated waterways at dusk, bouncing between spires of copper and stone, following a rhythm that almost resolved into melody before breaking off--an interrupted cadence that left the ear aching for completion. [109]

The echoes had grown louder this year. [116] Louder, and stranger. [119] They rattled shutters on the high bridges and made the canal water shiver into geometries no one could explain. [137] The Cartographers' Guild said it was wind. [144] The Acoustic Society said it was architecture. [151] Maren, who had spent her life pressing her face close to things others dismissed, believed something was alive down there in the sound, caged and calling. [177]

She needed to find the place where echoes are born. [187]

Her narrowboat slipped beneath a stone arch connecting the Tower of Doves to the Millhouse Spire, and she touched the pendant at her throat--a silver infinity symbol her grandmother had given her, warm always, as though it held a small heartbeat. [224] Her grandmother had called it a borrower's knot. [233] It sculpts time itself, the old woman had whispered. [242] Not stops it, not reverses it--sculpts, the way a potter sculpts clay, pulling moments longer, compressing hours thin. [259] By borrowing time from the future and folding it into the present, Maren could stretch a single minute into an hour of perfect, crystalline attention. [283] She had used it sparingly. [288] Borrowed time accrued interest. [292] Every stolen minute meant a minute lost later, taken from some unspecified tomorrow. [304]

But tonight she would spend freely, because tonight the giant beneath the city had fallen asleep. [319]

Everyone knew about the giant. [324] Its body formed the bedrock, its spine the ridge on which the towers stood. [337] It slept for decades, then stirred, then slept again. [347] When it napped, truly napped--not the shallow centuries-long dormancy but the brief, deep plunge into dreamlessness--the interrupted cadence of the echoes slowed, and their source drifted close to the surface. [380] The Guild's seismographs had registered the shift at sundown. [390] Maren had perhaps three hours before the giant turned in its sleep and the window closed. [406]

She pressed the pendant and felt time thicken around her like honey. [418] The canal water went glassy. [423] Ripples hung mid-propagation. [426] She paddled deeper into the network, following the echoes backward, past the Jade Aqueduct and the Sighing Locks, into canals so narrow the towers nearly kissed overhead. [452]

There. [453]

At the junction of seven waterways, where the canals formed a shape she recognized--an infinity loop, mirroring her pendant--the water pulsed upward in a column of sound made visible. [480] Inside it, she saw them: echoes in their larval state, coiled like luminous seahorses, trapped within a lattice of calcified resonance that the giant's breathing had built over millennia. [507] A cage of bone-frequency and mineral vibration. [514]

The interrupted cadence made sense now. [520] Every echo was a creature trying to complete its call, cut short by the lattice. [535] They were not sounds at all but something older, something between sound and life, and they wanted out. [554]

Maren opened her sketchbook and drew the lattice's structure with the precision of someone who had mapped ten thousand skeletons. [572] She found the stress point--a single node where the pattern could unravel. [584] She leaned over the bow, placed her palm against the water's surface, and hummed the note the cadence kept reaching for, the resolution it had never been allowed. [611]

The lattice cracked. [614] The echoes spiraled upward, uncaged, flooding the canals with a sound so complete it made her weep. [631] They dispersed into the towers, and for the first time the city heard what wholeness sounded like. [649]

The pendant cooled against her skin. [656] The borrowed time was spent. [661] Somewhere ahead, her future was three hours thinner, but the silence that followed the echoes' release was the most beautiful thing she had ever failed to draw. [690]

She picked up her pencil anyway. [697] The giant shifted below. [701] The water resumed its ordinary flowing. [707] And Maren, natural history illustrator, began the impossible task of sketching the empty space where captive music had been, so the world would remember what it looked like before it was set free.
