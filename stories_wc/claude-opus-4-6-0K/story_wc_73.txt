The staircase had no beginning and no end, and Maren had been climbing it for what she refused to call forever. [22]

She preferred to call it "not yet." [29]

Each step was identical to the last—smooth gray stone, eighteen centimeters high, worn at the lip where countless feet or perhaps only her feet had pressed upward in perpetual motion. [57] The walls on either side were close enough to touch if she spread her arms, and the ceiling hovered just above her head, descending and ascending with the stairs so that the volume of breathable space never changed. [92] Boundless in extent, confined in dimension—a hallway that went on without mercy or fatigue. [106]

Maren was a grim optimist by constitution. [113] She acknowledged the grimness of infinite stairs the way a sailor acknowledges the ocean: it would kill her if it could, but it hadn't yet, and that was cause for something adjacent to hope. [143] She was balancedly daring, neither reckless nor cautious, advancing at a pace that respected the impossibility of her situation without surrendering to it. [166]

In her left coat pocket, she carried a pair of dice. [177] One was pristine, its pips sharply indented; the other was chipped along one corner, a fracture that made every roll slightly biased. [198] She had stolen them from the table where she'd last seen Oran, the night the grant committee rejected their perpetual motion proof. [219]

That was the missed opportunity whose texture she was still trying to capture—not the grant itself, but the look on Oran's face when he'd said, "What if we're wrong about the impossibility?" and she'd laughed. [252] She had laughed because the mathematics were clear: perpetual motion violated thermodynamic law. [264] Through mathematical proofs she had demonstrated this dozens of times in lecture halls, scratching symbols across chalkboards with a certainty that left no room for wonder. [287] And Oran had set down his drink and picked up his coat and walked out, and the dice had stayed on the table beside his empty glass, and she had pocketed them without thinking. [319]

Now she was inside the thing she'd said couldn't exist. [330]

Perpetual motion. [332] A staircase that fed on its own geometry, each step generating the next, energy neither created nor destroyed because the system recognized no outside. [354] Maren climbed and the stairs climbed with her, an Escher fever dream made architectural. [367] She had tried stopping. [371] When she stopped, the stairs moved beneath her like an escalator, carrying her upward at the same rate, so that stillness and effort produced identical results. [394] The motion was not hers; it belonged to the structure. [404] She was merely the particle trapped inside it. [412]

She sat on a step and took out the dice. [422] The chipped one rolled crooked, landing on four while the pristine one showed six. [436] Ten. [437] She rolled again. [440] Five and three. [443] Eight. [444] Again: two and chipped-four. [448] Six. [449]

She began recording the outcomes on the wall with a piece of graphite she'd found in her pocket beside the dice. [469] Through mathematical proofs, she could map the bias the chip introduced—a slight preference for four on the damaged die, a deviation from the expected uniform distribution. [496] If she gathered enough data, she could quantify the imperfection precisely. [507]

The imperfection was the point. [512]

A perfect die in a perfect staircase would generate nothing—just noise inside perpetual symmetry. [525] But the chip was a rupture, a crack in the closed system, a place where the predictable broke open and something unmeasurable leaked through. [547] The bias meant the dice remembered their damage. [555] They carried the texture of the night they were abandoned on a table by a man who believed in impossible things. [573]

Maren wrote equations on the wall as the stairs carried her upward. [585] She proved that the chip's bias was 0.0371, a tiny asymmetry, a flaw smaller than a breath. [601] She circled the number and stared at it. [609]

It was the size of a laugh at the wrong moment. [620] It was the size of the silence after Oran left. [630]

She pocketed the dice and stood and climbed, not because climbing mattered in a staircase that moved regardless, but because choosing to move inside a system that denied choice was the most balancedly daring thing she could do. [668]

The staircase went on. [672] Maren went on with it. [677] The chipped die clicked against its twin in her pocket like a heartbeat with an arrhythmia—imperfect, persistent, refusing to stop. [698]

She smiled grimly upward into the infinite and whispered, "Not yet." [710]
