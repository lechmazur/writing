The lamp flickered out at 11:47 on a Thursday, and the darkness that filled the lantern room was not empty. [22]

Captain Maren Solvig had been supplying the lighthouse at Duskpoint for eleven years, ferrying oil and wick and silence across the strait every two weeks. [47] She was a reticent woman, not because she lacked thoughts but because she had learned that most words dissolved before they reached anyone who needed them. [73] Still, she noticed everything: the way the keeper's hands trembled more each visit, the way the gulls avoided the tower's western face, the way the glass panes in the lantern room sometimes held reflections that belonged to no one present. [107]

She was warmly observant in the way that certain people are -- cataloguing suffering not to exploit it but to understand where tenderness might be quietly inserted. [133]

The keeper, old Einar, had died three weeks before the lamp went dark. [146] No one had been assigned to replace him. [154] The maritime authority sent letters; the letters went unanswered, or perhaps the island answered in its own way, because each official who volunteered for the post withdrew within days, citing dreams they refused to describe. [187]

Maren did not believe in ghosts, but she believed in the lantern room. [200] She had felt it during every delivery -- a pressure behind her sternum, a humming grief that was almost beautiful, like light seen through water. [223] When the lamp finally died and the strait went black, she motored out alone. [236]

The lantern room was cold and smelled of brine and old iron. [248] Her flashlight caught the Fresnel lens fractured into a thousand tiny suns across the walls, but beyond that, shadows pooled in ways that defied the geometry of the space. [278] She felt watched, not with menace but with longing. [288]

On the gallery outside, she found the first cairn. [297]

Three stones stacked on the railing, the topmost a piece of sea glass the color of a held breath -- pale green, worn smooth, luminous even without a source of light. [327] She recognized the arrangement. [331] Along the coast, keepers had once stacked stones as messages, a language older than the signal flags: three stones meant "I am here." [353] Two meant "Send help." [357] One meant "Remember me." [361]

Inside, she found more. [365] On the stairs, on the sill, on the desk where Einar had kept his log -- cairns of two, of one, of three, arranged in sequences that read like letters. [394] An anonymous chain of correspondence between the living and whatever Einar had become, or whatever had always lived inside the tower's bones. [415]

Maren sat on the iron floor of the lantern room and read them by flashlight. [429] The messages were simple, repetitive, aching: I am here. [439] Remember me. [441] Send help. [443] I am here. [446]

She understood then what haunted this place. [453] It was not malice. [457] It was the desperate wish to bottle the feeling of safety -- to preserve the moment when light swept the water and every ship knew where the rocks were, when the darkness was held at bay by one bright turning eye. [495] The ghost, if ghost it was, wanted only to protect. [506]

Maren placed the sea glass in her coat pocket, where it rested warm against her ribs. [521] She climbed down to Einar's supply room, found the reserve oil, and spent two hours cleaning the mechanism, replacing the wick, priming the fuel lines with hands that were calloused and sure. [554]

When the lamp blazed back to life, the lantern room filled with a radiance that seemed to exceed the flame itself. [573] The shadows thinned. [576] The pressure behind her sternum shifted from grief to something almost like gratitude. [586]

She built her own cairn on the gallery railing. [595] Three stones, deliberate and steady. [600] I am here. [603]

Every two weeks after that, Maren made the crossing. [612] She maintained the lamp, she read the stone letters that appeared between her visits, and she left replies. [628] The anonymous chain continued -- a conversation conducted in granite and sea glass and the particular silence of someone who has chosen to stay. [650]

She never spoke of it to anyone onshore. [659] She did not need to. [664] Some things exist best in the space between words, in the luminescent ache of a lantern room where the dead and the living share the same simple prayer: let the light hold. [695] Let the ships pass safely. [700] Let someone, somewhere, stack three stones on a railing and mean it. [713]

The lamp never flickered out again. [719]
