The frozen library hung above the clouds like a cathedral of ice and forgotten thought, its spires catching the first pale suggestions of dawn. [25] Under the soft hush of a distant morning, Sable Voss climbed the last crystalline staircase and pushed through doors that hadn't opened in years. [48] She was a locksmith by trade, but not of ordinary locks -- she worked only during lunar eclipses, when the shadow-light revealed tumblers and mechanisms invisible to the waking world. [75] People called her the eclipse locksmith, and they came to her with boxes that wouldn't open, doors that led nowhere, hearts sealed shut by grief. [98] But she had come here for herself. [104]

The library's interior was hauntingly bright, every surface sheathed in frost that refracted the cloud-filtered sunrise into prismatic arcs across the vaulted ceiling. [126] Thousands of books lined the walls, their spines frozen mid-exhale, pages fused together by decades of cold. [141] Sable's breath came in small ghosts as she moved between the shelves, her fingers trailing along titles she could barely read beneath the ice. [165] She had not come for any particular book. [172] She had come to learn the rhythm of repair -- the deep, patient cadence that governed how broken things could be made whole again. [193]

Her own hands had been trembling for months now. [201] Locks she once opened by instinct resisted her. [209] The eclipse light still came, but she could no longer read what it revealed, as though the language of mechanisms had slipped from her memory like water through a cracked bowl. [238] She feared she was losing the only gift that had ever made her useful. [250]

In the library's farthest corner, behind a toppled reading stand, Sable found what she hadn't known she was looking for: scraps of prophecy hidden among the debris of collapsed shelves. [278] They were written on paper thin as onion skin, ink still dark despite the cold, as though the words themselves generated a faint warmth. [300] She gathered them carefully, piecing fragments together on the frozen floor. [310]

The prophecy spoke of a hall of mirrors -- not a place of vanity, but a chamber where every reflection showed a different stage of breaking and mending. [336] Enter the hall, the fragments read, and you will see yourself in every state of fracture. [351] Only by watching each reflection can you learn the tempo at which things come apart and, therefore, the tempo at which they return. [373]

Sable looked up. [376] At the center of the library, where the reading tables had been pushed aside long ago, stood a ring of tall mirrors, their frames carved from pale driftwood that smelled faintly of salt and distant summers. [406] She hadn't noticed them before, or perhaps they hadn't been there before. [417] The prophecy scraps warmed in her hands as she approached. [426]

Between two of the mirrors, on a small wooden table, sat a clockmaker's gear assortment -- dozens of brass wheels, springs, and escapements arranged in careful rows, as though someone had disassembled time itself and laid out its anatomy for study. [462] Sable understood. [464] The gears were not for clocks. [469] They were a vocabulary, each tooth and pivot a syllable in the language she had been forgetting. [483]

She reached into her coat and withdrew a small brass vial she always carried -- eclipse oil, collected drop by drop during her working hours. [505] She pressed her thumb to the cap and began to uncap it, the seal breaking with a whisper that echoed strangely among the mirrors. [528] The oil inside caught the hauntingly bright frost-light and held it, glowing like liquid moonrise. [541]

She let a single drop fall onto the largest gear. [550] It began to turn. [554] Then the next gear caught, and the next, a cascade of tiny rotations spreading across the table like a thought completing itself. [573] The mirrors responded, their surfaces rippling, and suddenly Sable saw herself reflected in every one -- hands steady, hands shaking, hands young, hands old, hands holding locks open, hands letting them fall. [601]

She watched the rhythm. [605] Break, mend, break, mend -- not a failure but a pulse, steady as breathing. [617] The gears turned in that same patient tempo, and she felt it enter her fingers, her wrists, the quiet architecture of her bones. [637]

The trembling stopped. [640]

Sable gathered the gear assortment into her satchel with the reverence of someone collecting seashells from a shore they might never visit again. [660] She folded the prophecy scraps and tucked them into her coat pocket, where they continued to radiate their faint warmth against her ribs. [681] The driftwood mirrors stood silent now, their reflections ordinary. [689]

She descended through the clouds as morning deepened, carrying with her the rhythm she had come to learn -- not perfection, but the steady, salt-worn patience of things that break and choose, again and again, to be repaired. [724]
