The temple had waited beneath the sea for so long that even the ocean had forgotten it. [16] Coral crusted its pillars like slow-burning candles, and bioluminescent algae traced the carved glyphs along its walls, casting the interior in a cold, spectral blue. [41] Maren drifted through the central nave, her rebreather hissing its measured rhythm, the only human sound in a silence so total it felt sacred. [62] A gathered hush lived here -- not mere quiet, but the concentrated stillness of centuries pressed into stone, as though the temple itself held its breath. [85]

She checked her wrist console. [89] Forty-one minutes of air remained. [94]

The distress signal she had sent three hours ago still pulsed from the beacon clipped to her dive belt, broadcasting into the deep on a frequency she doubted anyone monitored anymore. [122] She had triggered it when her submersible's tether cable snarled around a collapsed archway near the temple entrance, trapping her vehicle in a knot of ancient stone and modern steel. [149] Without the sub, she could not ascend safely from this depth. [160] Without rescue, the signal was merely a voice calling into void. [171]

But Maren had not come here to be rescued. [180] She had come to find the Vaelith -- a crystal perfume vial described in fragmentary texts as the last artifact of the temple's drowned priestesses. [202] They had been devotees of transience, worshippers of things that could not last: morning fog, the scent of night-blooming jasmine, the particular gold of a sunset seen only once. [230] Their faith held that the ephemeral was the most powerful force in existence precisely because it could not be held. [248] The Vaelith was their paradox, their masterwork -- a vessel said to capture what should be uncapturable. [263]

Maren needed it because she was losing her mother's voice. [273] Not the memory of words spoken, but the texture: the warmth, the cadence, the way it lilted upward at the ends of questions as though every inquiry were also an invitation. [302] Each year since her mother's death, more of that voice dissolved, and no recording could restore what lived only in the body's knowing. [325] The Vaelith, the texts promised, touches memories -- not preserving them as data, but holding their essence the way a vial holds perfume, so that uncorking it years later could flood a room with something everyone believed had vanished. [362]

To harness the ephemeral. [366] That was why she was here, breathing borrowed time in a temple the world had let sink. [381]

She found the inner sanctum behind a door of fused pearl. [392] The Vaelith rested on a pedestal of black basalt, and it was more beautiful than any text had conveyed: a slender crystal cylinder, no longer than her hand, faceted so finely that the bioluminescent light fractured inside it into constellations. [429] When her gloved fingers closed around it, something shifted in her chest -- a tightness, then a flooding. [446] She heard, distantly and impossibly, a laugh she had not heard in seven years. [459] Her eyes burned behind her mask. [465]

Twenty-nine minutes. [467]

She kicked back through the nave, the Vaelith secured in her chest pouch, and reached the entrance where her submersible hung tangled in the wreckage. [490] The cable had wound itself into a nightmarish snarl around the collapsed stones, and every instinct told her to cut it -- to sever the line and swim for the surface, risking decompression sickness and probable death. [523] Her hands actually reached for her dive knife. [530]

She stopped. [532] To unsnarl the cable she would need patience she did not feel, precision her panic rejected. [546] She would have to override every screaming instinct that demanded speed and choose instead the slow, deliberate work of unknotting. [563] The gathered hush of the temple pressed against her back as though urging stillness. [576]

She breathed. [578] She began with the outermost loop, easing it over a jutting stone. [590] Then the next. [593] Her fingers moved with a calm that felt borrowed from the priestesses themselves, women who had understood that the most precious things require surrender, not force. [616]

Eighteen minutes when the last loop fell free. [624] The cable floated upward, clean and straight. [631] She climbed into the submersible, powered the ascent thrusters, and rose through water that darkened and then, impossibly, began to lighten. [652]

Somewhere above, the sun was doing what it always did -- offering a light no one could keep. [669] Maren pressed her hand against the chest pouch where the Vaelith rested and felt, through neoprene and crystal both, the faintest tremor of a voice asking a question that was also an invitation. [700]

She answered it with silence, which was the only honest reply she had, rising through lonesome splendor toward the waiting, indifferent air. [721]
