The cryptocurrency crashes came like a tide retreating from shore, pulling fortunes back into nothing and leaving behind the strange detritus of a speculative age. [28] Maren had watched the collapse from her rain-beaded skylight loft, where droplets traced slow paths down the glass like the trajectories of falling markets. [50] She was an onyx-ink cartomancer, a reader of cards she printed herself using ink so dark it seemed to absorb light, and in the weeks after the crash, her clients had tripled. [78] People who once trusted algorithms now wanted something older, something that smelled of paper and intuition. [92]

But Maren did not believe in fortune-telling. [99] She believed in reverse engineering. [103]

Her loft sat above a defunct exchange office in the Marais district, a space she'd inherited from her grandmother along with three locked trunks, a reputation she didn't fully understand, and an unsettling sense that the cards knew more than she did. [141] The inheritance was less a gift than a mystery, steadily curious in how it revealed itself — one drawer, one symbol, one client confession at a time. [166]

Tonight she sat cross-legged on the floor surrounded by dozens of her onyx-ink cards, each one hand-pressed with images that merged tarot archetypes with data visualization patterns. [193] Beside her lay a cloth measuring tape, its faded numbers running from one to one hundred fifty centimeters. [210] Her grandmother had used it not for sewing but for measuring the distances between cards in a spread, insisting that the physical gaps carried meaning. [233] Maren had initially dismissed this as theater. [240] Now, after three months of mapping every reading she performed, she wasn't sure. [252]

Her project was simple in theory and enormous in practice: to map cultural patterns by analyzing the cards her clients chose, the questions they asked, and the spatial relationships between the symbols they were drawn to. [286] The crashes had provided an unprecedented dataset. [293] Fear had a geometry, it turned out, and grief had a recurring interval of eleven centimeters. [308]

She stretched the measuring tape between The Tower and The Moon in her latest spread. [323] Fourteen centimeters. [325] She logged it in her notebook alongside the client's question — a former crypto developer who wanted to know if trust could be rebuilt. [347]

The method she'd developed involved multiplying paths: for every card drawn, she calculated not just its singular meaning but every possible combination with every other card in the spread, then mapped those combinations spatially. [381] The result was a web of intersecting narratives, a topology of anxiety and hope that, when overlaid across hundreds of readings, began to show collective patterns as legible as weather systems. [413]

She was reverse engineering belief itself. [419]

A knock at the loft door interrupted her. [427] Jules, a former client turned reluctant friend, stood dripping in the hallway. [438] He'd lost everything in the crash — not just money but the architectural firm that money had funded. [454] He came now not for readings but for conversation, and Maren suspected he came because she was the only person who listened without offering solutions. [477]

He sat on the worn sofa beneath the skylight and watched rain shadows move across his hands. [493] "I need to confide something," he said. [500] "I knew the exchange was unstable. [505] I had the data. [509] I stayed in because everyone else was staying in." [518]

Maren set down her measuring tape. [523] "That's not a confession," she said. [529] "That's the pattern." [532]

She showed him the overlaid maps — translucent sheets covered in her onyx-ink notations, each one representing a week of readings stacked upon the last. [555] The shapes that emerged were unmistakable: spirals of collective decision-making, clusters where individual choice dissolved into herd movement, fault lines where communities fractured under identical pressures. [579]

Jules traced a spiral with his finger. [585] "You're saying we're predictable." [589]

"I'm saying we're patterned," she corrected. [595] "And patterns can be understood. [599] Maybe even interrupted." [602]

The rain intensified against the skylight, each bead a small lens magnifying the dark sky beyond. [617] Maren gathered her cards and began a new spread, not for divination but for documentation. [631] Every reading was a data point. [637] Every confession was a coordinate. [641] The inherited mystery of her grandmother's practice was revealing itself not as magic but as something more unsettling — an empirical record of how people fall together and come apart, measured in centimeters and onyx ink, waiting for someone steadily curious enough to read it. [683]

She picked up the measuring tape again. [690] Between The Star and The Fool: nine centimeters. [698] She wrote it down, adding another thread to the web, multiplying paths toward a map no one had ever thought to draw. [720]
