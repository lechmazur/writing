The orchard had no business growing where it did, but the apple trees never asked permission. [17] Their roots clutched the cathedral's rafters like arthritic fingers, drawing moisture from the fog that drifted through shattered rose windows, and their branches heavy with fruit dangled into the nave where pews had rotted to mulch decades ago. [50] Maren climbed the scaffolding each morning to tend them, her quartz-eye lens clicking softly as she adjusted its focus, the prosthetic refracting light into spectrums only she could read. [74] She was a mender by trade -- not of bones or cloth, but of the invisible fractures in crystalline structures, the stress lines in glass and gemstone that foretold collapse. [98] The orchard, impossibly vertical, was full of such fractures. [107]

She had been hired by the Growers' Compact to maintain their cathedral orchards across the northern territories, but that was before the breach of contract. [130] Three weeks ago, the Compact had dissolved her position, citing "unsustainable expenditures on arboreal anomalies." [143] They wanted the cathedral stripped, the trees felled, the wood sold. [153] Maren had refused to leave. [158]

"You're trespassing," said Fen, the Compact's young enforcer, standing below in the nave with her arms crossed. [173] She was endearingly feisty, this one -- barely twenty, all sharp angles and sharper words, sent to evict an old woman from a ruin. [196]

"I'm persisting," Maren corrected, not looking down. [203] She pressed her quartz eye against a branch where the bark had split, reading the fracture lines like scripture. [219] "There's a difference." [222]

"The contract is void. [226] You have no legal standing." [231]

"Contracts are deciduous things, dear." [236] Maren snapped a dead twig free and let it spiral down. [246] "They bud, they flourish, they drop away when the season turns. [257] But the tree remains." [261]

Fen caught the twig and stared at it. [268] "That's not how law works." [273]

"That's exactly how law works. [278] You just haven't lived long enough to watch the leaves fall twice." [289]

Maren descended carefully, her knees protesting each rung. [297] At the bottom, she unslung the canvas bag she carried everywhere -- her mending kit, though she hadn't opened it properly in years. [318] She rummaged past the loupes and the tuning forks, the cracked prisms and the calibration weights, searching for something she half-remembered packing a lifetime ago. [342]

Her fingers found it near the bottom: a daughter's hair ribbon, faded lavender, still carrying the faintest scent of someone who had stopped visiting long before the Compact stopped paying. [370] Maren held it up to the light filtering through the canopy above. [381]

"My daughter, Elsi, used to climb these trees when she was your age," Maren said quietly. [395] "She thought I was foolish for caring about things that grew in the wrong places. [410] She wanted me to take proper work in the city, mending chandeliers for rich people." [424] Maren tied the ribbon around the split branch she'd been examining. [434] "She was right that it would have paid better. [442] She was wrong that it would have mattered more." [450]

Fen watched the ribbon flutter. [455] "Why are you showing me this?" [460]

"Because you remind me of her. [466] Because someone sent you to do a hard thing, and you're trying to do it cleanly, and I respect that." [484] Maren reached into the forgotten bag again and pulled out a tuning fork, striking it against the nearest trunk. [501] The tone it produced was low, resonant, and the branches above shivered in response, loosing a cascade of pale blossoms. [520] "But listen." [522]

Fen listened. [524] The sound moved through the cathedral's bones, through stone and wood and the impossible marriage between them. [539] Something in the architecture answered -- a harmonic, deep and patient. [549]

"The trees are holding the roof up," Fen said slowly, understanding arriving like dawn. [562]

"They've been holding it for forty years. [569] You cut them down, the whole vault collapses. [577] The Compact loses the cathedral, the stone, everything." [585] Maren smiled. [587] "Arboreal anomalies, indeed." [590]

Fen was quiet for a long time, the twig still in her hand. [602] "I could file a structural dependency claim," she said finally. [611] "It would freeze the demolition order." [617]

"You could." [619]

"It would make the Compact furious." [624]

"Deciduous," Maren reminded her. [628] "Their fury will drop away. [633] The tree remains." [636]

Fen looked up at the orchard in the rafters, the impossible green persistence of it, and made her choice. [654] She pulled out her ledger and began to write. [663]

Maren climbed back up to her branches, the ribbon bright against the bark, and went on mending what others couldn't see was broken. [685] Below her, a young woman discovered that wisdom sometimes arrives not through intention but through accident -- through catching a dead twig, hearing a tuning fork, and choosing to persist in the wrong place for the right reasons. [720]

The blossoms kept falling, soft as shed contracts, and the cathedral held. [731]
