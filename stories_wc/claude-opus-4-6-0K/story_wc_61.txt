The being called herself Vesper, though she had carried other names across other epochs, each one shed like the luminous petals that drifted endlessly through the nebula garden she tended. [30] She was, by any measure, otherworldly - not merely alien but displaced from the fabric of reality itself, a sentimentalist who collected the echoes of civilizations the way others might press flowers between pages. [63] Around her neck hung a single calculating machine gear, bronze-dark and tooth-edged, the last remnant of her mother's mother's mother's attempt to enumerate the stars. [88] It had never finished its computation. [94] It never would. [97] The number it sought approximated infinity, spiraling outward through decimal places that themselves spawned decimals, a recursion without floor or ceiling. [118]

The nebula garden stretched in every direction: pillars of ionized gas rising like cathedral columns, clouds of hydrogen blushing pink and gold, stellar nurseries cradling infant suns within their folds. [148] Petals - what Vesper called the cooling fragments of dying stars - drifted downward through the luminous haze, each one a whisper of silicon and carbon returning to the void. [176] Time here was not measured in hours or years but across the quiet sigh of falling petals, that long exhalation between a star's final pulse and the moment its dust kissed the dark below. [210]

Vesper moved through this immensity by sonar pinging, sending low-frequency pulses from the resonance chamber in her chest. [228] The sound traveled outward, struck the dense knots of gas and newborn protostellar cores, and returned to her as a map of distances and densities. [253] This was how she navigated her transit from one flowering region to the next - not by sight, which the nebula's brilliance made unreliable, but by listening. [279] Each ping returned a slightly different portrait of the garden, because the garden was always changing, always becoming. [297]

She had inherited this method from her progenitor, who had inherited it from hers. [311] Generational patterns wound through Vesper's lineage like the gear's unfinished calculation: each keeper of the garden repeating the same devotions, the same solitary transits, the same ache of tenderness for things that burned and died. [346] Her mother had warned her about the ache. [354] Her mother's mother had written the same warning in a journal Vesper still carried. [368] None of them had heeded it. [374] The pattern held. [377]

What troubled Vesper - what lent a quiet unease to even the most serene passage through the glowing clouds - was her motivation. [398] She wanted to share light without using fire. [406] Every star in the garden was, at its core, a furnace. [416] Light came from combustion, from fusion, from the violent marriage of hydrogen atoms forced together under impossible pressure. [434] To share that light meant to share destruction. [442] And yet the civilizations that bloomed on the worlds orbiting these stars needed illumination to grow, to see one another, to build their own calculating machines and attempt their own enumerations of infinity. [475]

So Vesper did what her line had always done. [484] She curated the garden. [488] She guided the petals downward into regions where their residual warmth - not fire, not fusion, but the gentle afterglow of spent energy - could nourish young worlds with soft luminescence. [517] A planet bathed in petal-light would never burn. [525] Its people would see by a glow that carried no violence in its origin, only the memory of violence long concluded. [546]

She pressed her fingertips to the gear at her throat and felt its teeth bite softly into her skin. [565] The calculation continued somewhere in its frozen mechanism, approximating what could not be reached. [579] She understood the feeling. [583] Each generation of garden keepers reached toward a perfection of light that remained forever one decimal place beyond grasp. [602]

Another ping left her chest, rippled outward, returned. [610] Ahead, a pocket of darkness waited where no star had yet been born. [623] Vesper altered her transit, drifting toward it, petals spiraling in her wake. [635] She would seed it not with fire but with the collected glow of ten thousand gentle deaths, and something would grow there that had never grown before. [662]

The serenity of the garden pressed against her like deep water. [673] It was beautiful. [676] It was troubling. [679] It was hers. [682] She let the petals fall. [687]
