She had chosen to leave before they could make her forget. [10]

After the nostalgia ban swept through the coastal provinces, memory itself became contraband--not the faculty, but the indulgence, the act of turning backward to feel what once was. [40] The Tide Dancers were the first targeted, because their art was remembrance made physical: every swell they summoned carried the rhythm of older waters, ancient surges encoded in the body's sway. [67] Ereth had been the most skilled among them, capable of pulling a rip current into a waltz or coaxing a harbour into stillness with the slow grief of her hands. [95] But skill made her conspicuous, and conspicuousness under the new edicts meant erasure--neurochemical scrubbing until the past lay flat and tasteless as ash. [117]

So she chose elective exile. [122]

She walked inland, away from every coastline she had ever loved, until salt air became a rumor and the ground forgot how to be sand. [147] She found the twilight garden by accident, or perhaps by the logic of displacement, the way exiles always find the one place that will hold them. [174] It sat on a plateau where dusk seemed permanent, the sky locked in a violet hour that deepened but never fully darkened, stars appearing not as sudden diamonds but as slow exhalations of ancient light. [205] Stone paths wound between hedges of nightshade and lunar jasmine, and at the garden's center stood a granite basin filled with rainwater that never overflowed. [230]

Here she stopped. [233] Not because she decided to, but because her body refused to go further, as though some invisible mooring had threaded through her sternum and fastened itself to the bedrock. [258] She was spontaneously anchored, and the sensation was so foreign to a woman who had spent her life in motion that she wept for an hour without understanding why. [289]

In the weeks that followed, Ereth studied the garden the way she had once studied tides--by observing gaps. [307] The spaces between leaves where starlight pooled. [314] The silence between one cricket's song and the next. [323] The fracture lines in old flagstones where moss had not yet claimed dominion. [335] Gaps, she realized, were the grammar of the world, the pauses that gave meaning to every syllable of matter. [353] And in those pauses she found something she had never encountered in the ocean: stillness that was not absence but invitation. [371]

She began to dance again, though she had no tide to partner. [383] Her feet traced figures on the stone paths, pulling not water but the faint gravitational whisper of the stars overhead. [401] It was slower than tide dancing, more deliberate, each gesture a negotiation with light-years rather than lunar cycles. [417] She was learning a new vocabulary, and the garden was patient with her stumbling. [431]

One night she discovered the moonstone cabochon dust speck. [440] It clung to the rim of the granite basin, barely visible, a mote of iridescence no larger than a grain of pollen. [460] When she touched it, the speck dissolved against the pad of her finger and left a mark--a faint, luminous glyph that pulsed once, twice, then settled into her skin like ink accepting paper. [493] She understood then what the garden was offering, what her exile had been preparing her for. [509]

To pen a cosmic verse on mortal skin. [517]

Each night after that, she danced with greater abandon, and with each dance the garden yielded another speck, another glyph. [536] They appeared on her wrists, her collarbones, the arches of her feet--constellations transcribed into flesh, stanzas of a poem written in a language older than nostalgia. [560] She was not remembering. [564] She was becoming. [567]

The final glyph settled at the hollow of her throat on the night the stars shifted perceptibly, rearranging themselves in a pattern she recognized from her earliest tide dances--the configuration that heralded a fledging current, the moment a newborn wave detaches from the body of the ocean and becomes itself. [610] She felt the anchor in her chest dissolve, not with violence but with the obsidian grace of a shadow sliding from a wall at dawn. [636]

She was ready to fledge. [641]

Not back to the coast, not back to the provinces where memory was crime. [654] Upward, outward, into the grammar of gaps she had spent months learning to read. [668] The glyphs on her skin ignited softly, and she rose from the garden floor as though the plateau had exhaled her toward the violet sky. [694]

Below, the granite basin caught her reflection one last time and held it--not as nostalgia, but as proof that stillness and motion were never opposites, only stanzas in the same unfinished verse. [727]

The stars received her, and the twilight garden grew one shade darker, and somewhere along a scrubbed coastline a tide moved without knowing why it wept. [754]
