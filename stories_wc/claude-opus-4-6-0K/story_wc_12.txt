Father Elias knelt at the center of the dimensional anchor, a hexagonal chamber carved into the bedrock beneath St. Aldhelm's Cathedral, where six corridors met at precise angles that held the fabric of adjacent realities in place. [38] The walls were bare stone, unadorned except for absence itself — he had stripped every icon, every tapestry, every candle from the room over the past three years, decorating the space with silence until the chamber felt like the inside of a held breath. [74]

On the floor beside him sat his loop pedal, connected to a small amplifier that hummed at the threshold of perception. [93] He pressed the record trigger with his foot and began to speak. [104]

"What do we assume when we say a soul belongs to someone?" [115] His voice layered into the loop, repeating, folding over itself — a liturgy of questions building into a drone. [132] "Is it not also true that belonging implies ownership, and ownership implies separation, and separation implies that the soul could be taken?" [152] Through rhetorical devices like these, stacked and recursive, he plumbed the architecture of belief itself, searching for the load-bearing walls and the hollow ones. [175]

The loops accumulated. [178] His voice became a choir of inquiry, each phrase a thread pulled from the fabric of certainty. [193] This was his method, his strange vocation: to illuminate hidden assumptions, the invisible axioms people built their spiritual lives upon without ever examining the foundation. [217]

Today the work was not theoretical. [223]

In the corridor to his left, something breathed. [231]

Sister Maren had come to him four days ago, her eyes already beginning to shift between brown and a color that did not exist in the visible spectrum — a color he could only describe as the negative space where violet should be. [267] The possession was progressing in stages, and he understood, as few priests did, that possession was not an invasion but a slow agreement, a series of unchallenged assumptions the entity exploited like unlocked doors. [300]

Before the possession completes, he had told the bishop. [309] Give me until then. [313]

Now Maren sat in the corridor, restrained not by chains but by the geometry of the anchor itself, the convergence of dimensional lines that made it difficult for anything not fully native to this reality to move freely. [349] She listened to his loops. [354]

He lifted the artist's palette from the floor — a broad wooden oval bearing a single color, a grey mixed from ash and communion wine that he had prepared himself. [381] One color because multiplicity was distraction, and what he needed now was reduction, the unraveling of complexity back to its essential stillness. [402] He dipped his thumb into the grey and drew a slow circle on the stone before him. [417]

"Who told you that you were incomplete?" he asked, and the loop caught it, repeated it. [432] The question was aimed at Maren, but also at the thing wearing her assumptions like a second skin. [448] "Who told you that surrender was the same as peace?" [458]

From the corridor came a sound like fabric tearing underwater — muffled, dampened by the anchor's properties, yet carrying a strange clarity. [477] Maren's voice, doubled: "She invited me." [483]

"Did she?" [485] Father Elias pressed the pedal again, isolating that phrase, letting it loop. [496] Did she, did she, did she. [501] "Or did she fail to question what she'd been taught — that loneliness is a door, that emptiness is an invitation, that silence means absence rather than presence?" [524]

The grey circle on the floor began to glow faintly, not with light but with a kind of anti-shadow, a stillness made visible. [545] Unraveled stillness — not calm, but calm taken apart and laid bare so that every thread of it could be examined. [566]

The entity recoiled. [569] Not from faith, not from Latin phrases or holy water, but from the dissolution of the logic it depended on. [588] It had entered through Maren's unexamined grief, her inherited belief that suffering was sanctification, that to be hollow was to be holy. [608]

"You are not empty," Elias said, and the loops carried every question he had asked before, a scaffolding of doubt that was, paradoxically, the most loving thing he could offer. [638] "You are full of assumptions you never chose. [645] Put them down." [648]

Maren screamed, and the scream had one voice. [657] The grey circle pulsed once and went dark. [665] The corridors of the dimensional anchor fell silent — true silence now, not decorated but earned. [679]

Father Elias stopped the loop pedal. [685] In the quiet that followed, Maren wept with her own eyes, brown and only brown, and he sat with her in the unraveled stillness, where every assumption lay visible on the stone floor like scattered threads, waiting to be examined in the muffled clarity of morning.
