She waited, as she always did, until after the tide pools emptied. [12]

The canyon's lowest chambers still held the mineral scent of retreating water, and the red walls glistened like wounds freshly opened, but Maren knew the labyrinth was safest now, in the hours when the sea pulled back its fingers and left the ancient corridors dry enough to walk. [57]

She was known along the harbor as the poetic wharf weaver, a woman who braided rope and verse in equal measure, her calloused hands stitching nets while her mouth stitched metaphors that fishermen carried out to sea like prayers. [95] But the nets she wove on the docks were not her truest work. [107] Her truest work lived here, deep inside the centuries-old labyrinth carved into red canyon walls, where generations of sleepwalkers had worn grooves into the stone with their bare, unconscious feet. [137]

She carried her needle, her thread, and the single object she had stolen from her dead mother's house: a storybook illustration plate, a copper etching of a girl standing at the mouth of a maze, one hand reaching forward into darkness, the other clutching a flower. [177] The plate was heavy in her satchel, and its edges had cut her hip so many times she had a scar there shaped like a crescent. [200] She did not mind. [204] Every scar was a sentence in the story she was writing with her body. [217]

The labyrinth had been sealed for forty years, ever since the last cartographer declared it unmappable and the council declared it condemned. [238] Broken precedents, they called any attempt to enter. [247] The phrase had become a kind of curse in the canyon town, spoken whenever someone dared challenge the old prohibitions. [264] Broken precedents meant broken bones, broken minds, broken futures. [273]

But Maren had noticed something the cartographers never had. [282] The sleepwalkers -- those restless souls who wandered the canyon rim at night, eyes shut, mouths murmuring -- did not walk randomly. [300] Their paths overlapped. [303] Via overlapping sleepwalking paths, a map emerged, not on paper but in the erosion itself, grooves worn into sandstone by hundreds of dreaming feet across hundreds of years. [331] She had spent three years tracing those grooves by lantern light, charting each convergence, each divergence, until the labyrinth revealed its grammar. [352]

Tonight she had reached the innermost chamber. [360]

The walls here were carved with images so old their meaning had been forgotten, spirals and hands and shapes that might have been orchids, their petals curling inward like grief folding into hope. [392] Orchid solace -- that was what Maren felt in this place, a tenderness so fragile it ached, beauty persisting in absolute darkness. [414]

She knelt and unpacked her tools. [420] The illustration plate she pressed into a shallow depression in the wall where it fit as though the stone had been waiting for it. [443] The girl in the etching faced the same direction as the carved hands, reaching forward, reaching in. [460]

Then Maren began to sew. [465]

She drove her needle through the fine silk she had woven on the wharf, stitching panels together into a tapestry that mapped the labyrinth's true path -- every turn, every chamber, every convergence of sleepwalking trails. [498] She sewed the map so that anyone who followed it could walk from the entrance to this innermost room without fear. [518] She sewed it so the labyrinth would no longer be a ruin but a cathedral, not a condemnation but a corridor of reverence. [540] To carve a path from ruin to reverence -- that was the only motivation that had ever made sense to her, the only reason to risk broken precedents and broken bones. [570]

Her stitches were hauntingly optimistic, each one an act of faith that someone would come after her and read what she had written in thread. [594] That the council would see the tapestry and understand that the labyrinth was not a threat but an inheritance. [612] That the sleepwalkers had always known the way and had been whispering it into stone with their dreaming feet. [630]

She finished the last stitch as the first trickle of salt water crept across the chamber floor. [646] The tide was returning. [650] She hung the tapestry from iron hooks the ancients had left in the ceiling, high above the waterline, where it would survive. [672]

Then she pressed her palm against the illustration plate one final time, feeling the etched girl's outstretched hand beneath her fingertips. [693]

"We reached it," she whispered. [698]

She gathered her tools and followed her own map back through the labyrinth, the red walls glowing faintly in her lantern's light, and behind her the rising water sang against the stone like a lullaby that had finally remembered its words. [740]
