The elevator groaned upward through the frozen heart of the spire, and Lenne pressed her forehead against the frost-laced glass to watch the clouds sink beneath her. [30]

She had been a servant here for eleven years, scrubbing the lower kitchens where steam condensed into ice on the ceiling, but three days ago the Keeper had placed a hand on her shoulder and said, "You're needed higher now." [63] Each floor she ascended carried her farther from everything she understood. [73] The elevator climbed past the fourth floor, where archivists moved like pale fish behind frosted windows, and she held the bundle in her arms a little tighter. [95]

Inside the bundle were two things she had no right to possess: a leather-bound diary filled with cipher, and a pair of airship captain's goggles with prismatic lenses. [124] She had found them together in a sealed compartment behind the wall of the ninth-floor study, exposed when a pipe burst and split the plaster. [147] The diary's pages were dense with symbols she could not read, columns of substituted letters and strange geometric notations, but she had recognized the name embossed on the cover in fading gold: Aster Vael, her mother. [180]

Her mother, who had been an airship captain before the ice came and grounded all the fleets. [196] Her mother, who had climbed this same spire seventeen years ago and never descended. [211] The official record said she had thrown herself from the upper terrace. [223] Lenne had spent her childhood believing that record, letting grief freeze solid inside her the way water froze inside the walls. [242] But the diary suggested otherwise, and Lenne's warmly inquisitive nature would not let a locked thing stay locked. [259]

The elevator passed the sixth floor. [265] Through the glass she could see the sun beginning to angle across the spire's eastern face, and where it struck the ice, the light scattered into spectra—violet, amber, pale green—that slid across the elevator's interior like living things. [300] She turned the goggles over in her hands. [308] The prismatic lenses were not decorative, she realized. [317] They were tools. [320]

She lifted them to her eyes and opened the diary on her knee. [333] Through the lenses, the scattered light from the ice refracted again, and the cipher on the page shifted. [351] Certain letters glowed while others dimmed, and what had been impenetrable noise reorganized itself into sentences. [366] The method was elegant and mad: the diary could only be read here, in this spire, where sunlight passed through ancient ice at precise angles, and only through these particular lenses. [396] Her mother had encrypted her innermost life so that it could be unfolded only in the place that had consumed her. [416]

Lenne read, and the elevator climbed past the seventh floor. [426]

The entries were not what she expected. [433] There was anguish, yes—passages about the grounded fleet, the silence of engines, the terrible stillness of a captain with no sky. [454] But threaded through the grief was something else. [463] Aster wrote about Lenne as an infant, about the way her small fist closed around a finger with absolute conviction. [481] She wrote about the cook on the third floor who sang while kneading bread, about the way clouds looked from above versus below, about the particular shade of blue the ice turned at dusk. [514] She was cataloging joy, Lenne understood. [521] Not denying the anguish but excavating beneath it, methodically, tenderly, the way one might dig through snow to find a door. [541]

The eighth floor. [544] The ninth. [546]

The final entry was dated the day before her mother's recorded death. [558] It read: "I have found it again today. [566] The joy does not cancel the pain. [573] It lives underneath, stubborn as roots in frozen ground. [582] I want Lenne to know this. [588] I am leaving this here for her, for when she climbs high enough to find it." [603]

The elevator reached the tenth floor and stopped. [611] The doors opened onto a corridor of pure ice and light, the uppermost inhabited level of the spire, where Lenne had been reassigned to serve. [636] She stood there with the goggles around her neck and the open diary in her hands, and she understood that her mother had not thrown herself from the terrace. [665] She had hidden this and then vanished into the sky by some means Lenne did not yet know, leaving a trail that only her daughter, ascending year by year through the spire's hierarchy, would one day follow. [700]

Lenne stepped out of the elevator with an expression that anyone watching might have described as calm, even detached, but which carried inside it an enormous and specific warmth. [729] She closed the diary gently, folded the goggles into her apron, and walked toward her new life in the upper spire, carrying her mother's joy like a lantern in the permafrost dark. [762]
