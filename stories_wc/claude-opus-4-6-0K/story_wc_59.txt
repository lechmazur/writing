The palace hung like a frozen tear beneath the cavern roof, its towers and bridges anchored to stalactites so vast they seemed the ribs of some buried god. [28] Prince Casien moved through its corridors in clothes that had once been silk but were now stained with mineral water and bird lime, his hair matted, his hands trembling with purpose. [59] He had not descended to the surface in three years, not since the last songbird fell silent and the foundries filled the valleys with their clockwork replacements. [86]

He was trying to assemble a miracle. [93]

On his worktable lay the egg: pale blue, faintly speckled, no larger than his closed fist. [109] It was the last egg of the veranelle, a species declared extinct eleven years before Casien was born. [127] He had found it sealed in his grandmother's reliquary, nested in dried moss that still carried the ghost of a forest smell. [149] The shell was cool and dense, and when he held it to the lantern light, he swore he could see a shadow curled inside, a comma of potential, waiting. [178]

He hypothesized about everything. [182] That was his method, his madness: standing at the edge of the palace's hanging balconies, watching the mechanical sparrows flit below in their joyless parabolas, and asking why. [210] Why had the old creation failed? [216] Why had feathers given way to copper filaments? [224] He filled journals with questions that branched into other questions, diagrams of embryonic development beside sketches of gear assemblies, notes on how warmth and rotation coaxed life from calcium shell. [254] He hypothesized that the original world had been a flawed genesis, not broken but imperfect by design, carrying within its beauty the seed of its own undoing. [281] The songbirds had been too delicate for the soot. [290] The forests too combustible for the furnaces. [297] Creation had made things exquisite and fragile in equal measure, and industry had simply called the bluff. [314]

But fragility, he believed, was not a defect. [322] It was the price of being alive. [329]

So he built an incubator from salvaged palace heating coils and cave-crystal lenses that focused geothermal warmth into a steady, womblike pulse. [351] He assembled it piece by piece over months, hypothesizing at each stage: what temperature a veranelle mother's breast would have maintained, what frequencies of sound might stir cellular memory, what mineral content the shell needed to breathe. [388] He piped in the sound of dripping water, the closest thing to music left in the cavern. [405] He talked to the egg. [410] He told it about dawn, which he remembered, and about the color of open sky, which he was beginning to forget. [431]

The discovery came not as a crack but as a vibration. [442]

One evening the egg shuddered against his palm, and something inside pressed outward with a motion so small and so deliberate that Casien wept. [466] He held it beneath the crystal lenses and watched a fissure travel the shell like a river finding its path. [486] The sound that emerged was bitterly sweet, a single wet chirp that contained in its two broken notes both the memory of every veranelle that had ever sung and the bewilderment of being the last one born into silence. [525]

The chick was malformed. [529] One wing curled inward. [533] Its eyes were clouded on the left side. [541] Flawed genesis, repeated in miniature: life arriving imperfect, as it always had. [553] Casien cupped the creature in his stained hands and felt the palace sway on its ancient anchors, the stalactites groaning as though the cavern itself drew breath. [580]

He did not care that it was broken. [588] He cared that it was warm. [594]

Below, the foundries churned. [598] The mechanical sparrows traced their perfect, meaningless arcs. [606] But here, in a palace suspended between stone sky and empty air, a bedraggled prince held a trembling bird and understood that beauty had never been about perfection. [634] It was about the courage of incomplete things to exist anyway, to open their mouths and sing one frail note into the dark, expecting nothing, offering everything. [661]

The veranelle chirped again, stronger now. [667]

Casien answered with a sound he had almost forgotten how to make. [679]

He laughed. [681]
