The first time Elara knocked on apartment 4C, she only wanted sugar. [12]

She had moved into the old Harwood Building three weeks prior, drawn by the way its limestone facade whispered in a dialect she couldn't yet parse. [38] The cornices spoke in flourishes, the lintels in measured declarations, and the cracked mortar between the bricks murmured something she desperately needed to understand. [58] She had come to this city to learn the language of old buildings, the grammar of arches and the syntax of load-bearing walls, and the Harwood was the most eloquent structure she had ever encountered. [89]

But apartment 4C belonged to Mrs. Demetria Voss, and Mrs. Voss was not simply a neighbor. [105]

She answered the door that first evening with flour on her wrists and an expression of mysterious familiarity, as though she had been expecting Elara not just today but for years. [136] She gave the sugar freely and invited Elara back for tea the following Tuesday. [150] That tea became a weekly ritual, and within a month Elara realized she had been gently, patiently drawn into something far stranger than neighborly hospitality. [175]

Mrs. Voss, it turned out, was a dead language tutor. [185]

Not dead as in deceased, though she moved through the world with a spectral quietness that made Elara wonder. [201] She taught languages that no living population spoke: Sumerian, Etruscan, Gothic, and others that had no names left, only echoes preserved in stone inscriptions and temple foundations. [228] Her apartment was filled with rubbings from ancient walls, and on her desk sat an antique desk seal carved from obsidian, its base engraved with a symbol Elara did not recognize. [258]

"Every building tells agreed upon lies," Mrs. Voss said one Tuesday, pouring chamomile with patiently nimble fingers that moved like a pianist's despite her age. [282] "The architect agrees with the patron on what the facade should say. [293] Strength, permanence, welcome. [296] But the building itself, over time, develops its own vocabulary. [306] Cracks are confessions. [309] Settling is sighing. [312] You want to read what the Harwood is really saying, yes?" [322]

Elara nodded, and the lessons began in earnest. [330]

Each week Mrs. Voss taught her a different extinct tongue, connecting its phonemes to architectural features. [344] Etruscan mapped onto archways. [348] Gothic illuminated the ribbed vaulting in the Harwood's lobby. [357] The obsidian seal, Mrs. Voss explained, had belonged to a stonemason's guild that encoded messages into foundations, truths hidden beneath the agreed upon lies of grand facades. [381]

Then came the night of the meteor shower. [389]

Mrs. Voss led Elara up the service stairs to the rooftop garden, a place Elara hadn't known existed, lush with night-blooming jasmine and herbs growing in cracked terracotta pots between rusted ventilation units. [422] The sky split with light, streak after streak, and the old woman sat among her plants and began to interrogate Elara with a sudden intensity that felt ceremonial. [449]

"What does the east wall say?" [455]

"It grieves. [457] The original window was bricked over in 1943." [464]

"And the foundation stone?" [468]

"It carries a mason's mark that means 'remember what is buried.'" [478]

"What is buried?" [481]

Elara hesitated. [483] Over weeks of study she had translated the symbol on the desk seal and found its match scratched into the Harwood's cornerstone. [502] Beneath the agreed upon lie of a simple date inscription, there was a message in a language older than the building itself, older than the city. [529] It read: the keeper passes the tongue to the next who listens. [541]

"You already know," Elara whispered. [546]

Mrs. Voss smiled as a meteor blazed overhead, casting her face in brief, ancient light. [561] She pressed the obsidian seal into Elara's palm. [570] Its weight was surprising, warm as though it had been held moments before by someone else, and someone before that, a chain of hands reaching back into illegible centuries. [596]

"I have been the Harwood's translator for forty years," Mrs. Voss said. [608] "The building chose you the day you moved in. [617] I was just waiting for you to come knocking." [625]

Above them the sky burned with falling stars, and the rooftop garden hummed with the quiet resonance of limestone and jasmine, of languages not dead but sleeping, waiting for the next voice patient and nimble enough to speak them aloud. [663]

Elara closed her fingers around the seal and listened to the building breathe beneath her feet, its old walls finally, fully, legible. [684]

The agreed upon lies of the facade still stood, proud and silent, facing the street. [698] But underneath, in a dialect only two women had ever shared over weekly cups of tea, the truth went on murmuring, as it always had, waiting to be read. [728]
