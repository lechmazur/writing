The palace of Nebukhadnezzar had been reimagined three times in Samara's lifetime. [12] Each new regime tore down the banners and repainted the glazed bricks but kept the ziggurat's bones, as if even conquerors understood that some geometries were older than sovereignty. [41] Now, between regimes -- the last governor fled, the next not yet arrived -- the halls stood open to dust and starlight, and Samara finally had the silence she needed. [69]

She was frugal by necessity and temperament. [76] Where other astronomers requisitioned bronze instruments and lapis-inlaid astrolabes, she worked with a reed stylus, a pot of lampblack, and whatever clay the river offered freely. [102] Her robes were mended so many times they resembled their own schematic representations -- thread-maps of a decade's careful poverty. [121] Yet frugality had sharpened her eye. [127] She noticed what lavish men overlooked. [133]

The magic square tile, for instance. [139]

It had been set into the floor of the throne room's antechamber for centuries, dismissed as decorative. [156] A grid of sixteen cells, each holding a cuneiform numeral, glazed in teal and ocher. [171] Every row, column, and diagonal summed to thirty-four. [179] Samara had knelt beside it hundreds of times while waiting for audiences that cost her nothing but patience. [197] But last week, during the chaos of the governor's departure, she had finally been able to study it undisturbed, and she realized the tile was not merely mathematical. [225] It was devotional. [228]

The numerals, read as a sequence rather than a grid, corresponded to stellar positions -- specific coordinates in the sky above Babylon on a night that her calculations placed over two thousand years in the past. [263] Someone had encrypted devotion into arithmetic, hiding a prayer inside a proof. [275] It was, she thought, empirically ironic: the most rational object in the palace turned out to be the most sacred. [295]

Now she worked to uncloak the rest. [302]

She spread her schematics across the antechamber floor -- sheets of pressed reed paper covered in star charts, coordinate grids, and angular measurements. [324] Through these schematic representations, she translated the tile's numbers into celestial geometry, mapping each value onto the heavens. [342] What emerged was not a single constellation but a sequence: a path the eye would trace across the sky, connecting stars that no known tradition grouped together. [369]

A new constellation. [372] Or rather, an ancient one, forgotten by every culture that followed. [383]

The shape it formed was unmistakable -- two hands clasped, fingers interlocking. [394] A covenant gesture. [397] Whoever had made this tile had sealed their faith not in words or icons but in the cold precision of number, trusting that someday another watcher of the sky would look up and understand. [431]

Samara sat back on her heels. [437] The palace breathed around her, its corridors open to the evening. [448] Amber light pooled through high windows, and somewhere a nightjar called from the hanging gardens' overgrown terraces. [465] The dusky harmony of the hour settled into her chest -- the world balanced between day and dark, between one authority and the next, between the known and whatever lay beyond the last catalogued star. [499]

She understood now what the tile's creator had wanted. [508] Not worship of any named god, but a covenant with the unknown itself -- an agreement that the universe's patterns were worth a lifetime's devotion, even if no one witnessed the devotion, even if the prayer went unanswered for millennia. [547]

She had spent her career being frugal with belief as much as with coin. [561] She trusted only what her instruments confirmed. [568] But here was confirmation of a different kind: evidence that someone, impossibly long ago, had looked at the same sky and felt the same pull toward something that could not be measured, only encoded, only offered. [604]

Samara placed her hand on the tile. [611] The glaze was cool and smooth, old beyond reckoning. [620]

She whispered the coordinates aloud, one by one, her voice filling the empty throne room. [635] It was not a prayer, exactly. [641] It was an acceptance. [645] The covenant had waited two thousand years for a second signatory, and she was frugal enough to know that some offers do not come twice. [670]

Outside, the first stars appeared, indifferent and precise, and Samara watched them with the quiet certainty of a woman who had finally found the document she did not know she had been asked to sign. [705]
