The xenobiology research station hung like a copper lantern in the upper atmosphere of Kepler-442b, its hull mechanically warm to the touch even as frost crystallized along the observation rails. [32] Maren Voss pressed her palm against the outer plating and felt the familiar hum of generators cycling heat through the station's skin, a pulse that reminded her of something living, something patient. [60]

She was an obliging sky mechanic by trade, the kind of person who said yes to every repair request, every recalibration, every midnight call about a flickering conduit. [87] But she hadn't come to this remote posting to fix things. [97] She had come to prove that time moves sideways. [106]

The theory had consumed her for six years. [114] Not forward, not backward, but laterally--time displacing itself like light through a prism, each moment existing simultaneously beside every other moment, accessible if you understood the angles. [138] The xenobiologists at the station studied the winged organisms native to the planet's cloud layers, creatures whose metabolism seemed to violate temporal thermodynamics. [158] Their cells aged in directions that made no linear sense. [168] Maren believed these organisms were evidence, living proof of lateral time. [179]

No one took her seriously. [184] Dr. Shan, the station director, tolerated her presence because she kept the atmospheric scrubbers running and never complained about double shifts. [203] The other researchers smiled politely when she mentioned her work, then returned to their specimen tanks and gene sequencers. [220] Maren didn't mind. [223] She had learned long ago that awakenings rarely announced themselves with thunder. [233] They arrived subdued, quiet, like a truth you'd known all along finally finding its name. [248]

Tonight, twilight settled across the cloud sea in ribbons of amber and violet. [261] Maren climbed to the station's upper platform where the magnetic nexus array was mounted--a ring of superconducting coils originally designed to study the planet's magnetosphere. [286] At twilight, when the planet's magnetic field shifted polarity in its nightly cycle, the nexus became something else entirely. [303] The field lines converged into a singularity of aligned force, and for eleven minutes, the array could project holographic reconstructions of any data fed through it. [327]

She had modified the system over months of patient, obliging work--a rewired coupling here, a recalibrated sensor there, each favor she performed for the science team giving her access to another component she needed. [360] Tonight, she would feed the temporal biosignatures of the winged creatures through holographic principles, mapping their impossible cellular aging into three-dimensional phase space. [382] If time truly moved sideways, the hologram would show it. [392]

The creatures themselves roosted along the station's lower struts at dusk, folding their vast translucent wings against the hull. [410] Within the hush of beating wings at rest, the station grew impossibly still. [423] Maren could hear her own heartbeat, the soft tick of cooling metal, the breath of the world below. [440]

She reached for the activation lever. [446] It was cold beneath her fingers, and she paused, aware of the icy warmth of this moment--the freezing air against her cheeks, the deep mechanical heat radiating up through the platform beneath her boots. [478] She pulled. [480]

The nexus hummed to life. [485] The hologram bloomed above the array like a flower made of light, and Maren watched the data unfold. [503] The cellular signatures of the winged creatures spiraled outward, not along a timeline but across one. [519] Each moment of biological change existed beside the others, not sequential but adjacent. [531] The hologram showed time fanning out like pages in an open book, each page touching every other page at the spine. [551]

Maren's breath caught. [554] It was there. [557] Lateral displacement. [559] Time moving sideways, exactly as she had theorized, written in the biology of creatures that had never known a clock. [577]

She stood in the glow of proof, and no one was there to see it. [592] The winged creatures shifted in their sleep below, murmuring in frequencies too low for human ears. [607] The hologram pulsed with quiet, undeniable truth. [615]

Tomorrow she would show Dr. Shan. [621] Tomorrow there would be questions, skepticism, replication demands. [629] But right now, in this hush, Maren allowed herself the subdued awakening she had always imagined--not a shout but a whisper, not a revolution but a turning, like the planet beneath her rotating its face toward a light that had been there all along, arriving not from ahead or behind but from the side, from somewhere no one had thought to look. [688]

She rested her hand on the mechanically warm hull and watched twilight deepen into dark. [703] The magnetic nexus dimmed. [707] The hologram folded itself away like a secret returning to its keeper. [719] And time, indifferent to direction, moved on in every way it knew how. [733]
