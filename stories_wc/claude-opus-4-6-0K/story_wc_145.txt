The falcon came back on a Tuesday, which meant the waiting was over and the worrying could finally begin in earnest. [24]

Maren watched it settle on the iron perch outside the outpost, its talons scraping rust into the still air. [43] The bird carried nothing visible, but its return was the signal she had agreed upon with the cartographic bureau six months ago, back when she still believed in clean deadlines and warm offices. [74] Now she sat in a rusted outpost by a frozen lake, editing atlas proofs by lamplight, and the falcon's arrival meant that somewhere upstream, the survey team had found something worth mapping. [105]

She was subtly confident in her ability to remain calm. [115] She had built a career on it — the dry, measured composure of a woman who corrected borders for a living while governments redrew them overnight. [138] "Rivers don't care about your politics," she liked to tell junior cartographers. [149] "They go where gravity sends them." [155]

But gravity, it turned out, had a sense of humor. [165]

The survey team's last transmission, decoded from the falcon's leg capsule by the outpost radio operator, contained coordinates that shouldn't have existed. [185] Three rivers — the Kas, the Velna, and the Orm — all appeared to originate from the same point. [201] A singular convergence, the geologists were calling it, though convergence implied meeting, and this was the opposite: a single source splitting into three. [224] The place where the rivers begin. [230]

Maren had spent her entire professional life trying to find exactly this. [241] Not for glory, not for the bureau's funding cycles, but because every atlas she'd ever edited contained a lie at the headwaters. [262] Dotted lines. [264] Question marks. [266] The cartographic equivalent of a shrug. [272] She wanted to replace the shrug with a period. [281]

She pulled out the phrasebook she'd borrowed from Dahl, the outpost's polyglot translator, who spoke seven languages and trusted none of them. [303] She opened it to the dog-eared page — Dahl's own marking — where indigenous place-names for water sources were compiled in three scripts. [324] The dog-ear had become her bookmark, her talisman, the crease in the paper that said someone else had thought this page mattered. [345] One entry read: "Keskara — the mouth that speaks three tongues." [355] The coordinates matched. [358]

Outside, the frozen lake lay under a sky so pale it seemed drained of intent. [372] The tranquility was the worrying kind, the sort that made you check the barometer twice because silence that deep usually preceded something. [393] Maren pressed her palm against the window glass and watched the condensation form around her fingers, then slowly retreat. [412] She had learned to read these patterns years ago — the way moisture gathered and dispersed on cold glass could tell you about pressure changes, temperature shifts, the invisible architecture of approaching weather. [442] The pattern of condensation on the glass now showed her that the air was dropping fast. [458] A storm, maybe twelve hours out. [464]

Twelve hours was enough. [468]

She drafted the memorandum that would herald the expedition's next phase, writing in the precise, unemotional language the bureau preferred, though she allowed herself one small flourish: "The source is singular. [498] The rivers remember." [501]

She imagined the memo reaching the capital, imagined the junior editors frowning at her flourish, imagined Dahl laughing when she told him his dog-eared page had been the key. [530] She imagined the atlas — her atlas, the one she'd spent eleven years revising — finally containing a definitive point where three blue lines met and became one. [557]

The falcon ruffled its feathers on the perch, indifferent to cartographic ambition. [568] Maren envied the bird. [572] It navigated by instinct, not by the laborious triangulation of evidence and hope that defined her work. [588] But instinct had brought it back to this rusted outpost, and evidence had brought her, and perhaps those were the same river flowing from the same source after all. [617]

She sealed the memorandum, fed the falcon a strip of dried fish, and stood at the window one more time. [637] The condensation had cleared entirely now, leaving the glass transparent, the frozen lake visible in its full, unnerving stillness. [657] Somewhere beyond that ice, past the birch forests and the basalt ridges, three rivers poured from a single crack in the earth, and no one had yet drawn it right. [688]

Maren picked up her pen, opened the atlas to the blank space at the headwaters, and began. [706]

The tranquility held, worrying and perfect, as the first line of ink dried on the page. [722]
