The mist never left Platform Seven. [6] It clung to the iron rails and pooled in the hollows between timber sleepers, fed by the fountain that the old depot master had installed decades ago as a monument to journeys begun and never completed. [39] Elara stood beside that fountain now, her white cane folded in her coat pocket, her blind eyes turned toward the sound of water cascading over carved stone. [63]

She had not always been blind. [69] Three years ago, a welding arc had stolen the last of her sight, but it had not stolen her hands, nor the deep intuition she carried for broken things. [96] Her repair shop occupied the old luggage room at the depot's east end, its shelves crowded with clockwork toys, fractured instruments, and the delicate mechanical creatures that had become her specialty. [124] People traveled from distant towns to bring her work because Elara was a heartfelt artisan, one who listened to damage the way a physician listens to a heart. [150]

This morning, however, she had a visitor she had not expected. [161]

Captain Maren Solberg arrived with heavy boots and a careful voice, carrying a velvet-lined case. [175] Inside lay an artificial hummingbird drone, its wings creased, its navigation array dark. [187] The drone was the sole guidance system for the Celestine, a new cargo vessel moored at the harbor just beyond the depot, and in less than an hour, the anchor would lift for the ship's maiden voyage. [222]

"It struck a support beam during final testing," Maren said, placing the case on Elara's workbench. [237] "The onboard sensors feed navigational data to the bridge, but right now it just spirals in circles. [252] If I sail without it, we navigate blind." [259]

Elara's fingers found the drone's body, tracing hairline fractures across its thorax, feeling the misalignment where the left wing servo had twisted a fraction of a degree. [285] She could patch the structural damage easily enough; resin and microfilament were old friends. [297] The harder problem was calibration. [302] The drone oriented itself by reading light refraction through water features, harbors, rivers, rain, converting the angle of bent light into directional data. [321] Without sight, Elara could not simply look at a diagnostic screen to confirm the fix. [336]

But she had learned another way. [342]

She carried the drone outside to the fountain on Platform Seven, where mist wrapped them both in magnetic calm. [358] Maren followed, watching in silence as Elara powered the tiny machine and held it above the cascading water. [374] The drone's wings hummed to life, throwing vibrations through her fingertips. [384] She tilted it slowly, letting its sensors drink in the refracted light that danced through the fountain's spray. [399]

Every shift in the drone's motor frequency told her something. [409] A stutter meant the refraction index was misread; a smooth acceleration meant the light was bending correctly through the water and the sensor was decoding feedback into direction. [435] She oversaw the process while blind, her ears and hands substituting for the eyes the world assumed were necessary. [452]

She set the drone down, opened its thorax with a jeweler's pick, and began to patch the cracked sensor housing with steady, unhurried strokes of adhesive. [477] Then she adjusted the servo, a quarter turn counterclockwise, feeling the click that told her the wing geometry had returned to specification. [498]

She lifted the drone again above the fountain. [507] This time the hum was seamless, a single sustained note that rose and fell in perfect sympathy with the water's motion. [527] The mist parted gently as the hummingbird lifted from her palm, hovered, then executed a precise figure eight before returning to her open hand. [550]

Maren exhaled. [552] "How do you know it's right?" [557]

"The same way you know when a ship sits true in the water," Elara said. [571] "You feel it." [574]

A horn sounded from the harbor, low and resonant, rolling through the depot's iron bones. [588] The anchor chain was already clanking upward. [595] Maren took the drone, clasped Elara's hand once, and ran. [605]

Elara remained beside the fountain, listening as the Celestine's engines caught and steadied. [618] Somewhere above the harbor, a tiny pair of wings would be reading the light on the water, translating refraction into a heading that would carry the ship beyond the horizon. [648]

She folded her cane back into her pocket and returned to the repair shop, where the next broken thing was already waiting. [670] The mist closed behind her, patient and luminous, as if it too understood that every departure begins with something mended. [689]
