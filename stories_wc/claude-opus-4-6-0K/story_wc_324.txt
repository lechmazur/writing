Maren's title, printed on a laminated badge she never wore, read "Cardiac Proximity Specialist." [14] Everyone in the Bureau called them contact tracers for hearts. [24] The job was simple in theory: when the dead called — that bruised hour between twilight and full dark when the boundary thinned — certain living hearts answered. [50] Maren's work was to trace those connections, map the emotional contagion, and sever any link that threatened to pull a living person under. [73]

She worked from the mist-clad atrium of the old municipal conservatory, a glass-roofed hall where fog gathered each evening like a congregation. [95] The building had been repurposed decades ago when the callings first began. [107] Now ferns pressed against the walls and condensation wept down the panes, and Maren sat at her station among the green silence, listening. [130]

Her method was peculiar even by Bureau standards. [138] Most tracers used modern resonance arrays. [144] Maren tracked faint pulses in a decades-old hearing aid — her grandmother's, a clunky analog device from the 1980s that had no business receiving anything beyond ambient sound. [171] But it did. [174] Maren had discovered, through being persistently curious about every anomaly that crossed her desk, that older devices carried a particular sensitivity to the frequencies the dead used. [201] Digital equipment filtered them out. [206] Her grandmother's hearing aid, with its imperfect circuits and warm distortion, caught what nothing else could: the sub-whispers, the calls aimed at the most vulnerable — children, the grieving, the lonely. [236]

Those were the voices Maren lived to protect. [244] Vulnerable voices that couldn't distinguish between comfort and consumption, between a loved one's genuine farewell and something older wearing a familiar face. [266]

Tonight the mist was thick. [271] Twilight bled purple through the glass ceiling. [278] Maren pressed the hearing aid to her ear and closed her eyes. [290]

Static. [291] Then beneath it, a pulse — faint, rhythmic, warm. [299] A heart-signal reaching out from the other side. [307] She traced its trajectory: northwest quadrant, residential block, a house she'd flagged before. [320] The Calloway residence. [323] Elderly widower, recently bereaved. [327] High susceptibility. [329]

She logged the contact and was about to dispatch a field agent when a second pulse threaded through the first. [349] This one was different — smaller, faster, a child's cardiac rhythm tangled in the signal like a bird caught in a net. [370]

Maren sat forward. [373] There was no child in the Calloway file. [381]

She adjusted the hearing aid's volume wheel, coaxing clarity from the ancient circuitry. [394] The child's pulse was accelerating. [399] Fear. [400] Whoever this was, they were being drawn in through Calloway's open channel — an incidental catch, a bystander swept up in a connection meant for someone else. [426]

Maren grabbed the last photograph pinned to her corkboard — a printout from the neighborhood surveillance feed, the most recent image of the Calloway street. [450] She scanned the houses adjacent. [455] Number 14: a foster home. [460] Seven children, all under twelve. [465] All exactly the kind of vulnerable voices the callings preyed upon. [476]

She didn't have time for protocol. [482] She pressed the hearing aid tight against her ear and spoke into the frequency, something tracers were trained never to do. [503] She pushed her own living warmth into the channel, her own steady heartbeat, and she aimed it at that small, frightened pulse. [525]

"You're safe," she said, the words dissolving into signal. [534] "You're not alone. [537] Listen to my heart, not theirs. [543] You're safe." [545]

She felt the child's rhythm stutter, catch, then slow. [554] Sync. [555] The small pulse steadied against hers, two hearts beating in tandem across the divide, and the dead signal frayed, lost its grip, dissolved into the mist like breath on glass. [585]

Maren exhaled. [587] Her hands were shaking. [591]

She hadn't meant to be heroic. [597] She'd simply been doing her job — following a stray thread because she couldn't leave a question unanswered, because curiosity was the only compass she trusted. [622] Incidental heroism, the Bureau would call it later, when they reviewed her logs and realized she'd broken protocol to assure a child she couldn't see that the dark was not as hungry as it seemed. [657]

The atrium settled into its reeling hush. [664] Condensation traced slow lines down the glass. [671] Somewhere in a foster home on a mist-covered street, a child slept without nightmares for the first time in weeks. [691]

Maren placed the hearing aid on her desk, gently, the way you set down something sacred. [707] Then she picked up the photograph, studied the street one more time, and pinned it back to the board. [726] Tomorrow the dead would call again. [732] She would be listening. [736]
