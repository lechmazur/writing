Maren had been stationed at the Locus for eleven months when she finally accepted that the signals were not asking to be understood. [21] They were asking to be rewritten. [27]

The Locus was a gravitational anomaly three light-hours from the nearest relay beacon, a place where spacetime pooled like water in a cupped palm. [49] Transmissions that passed through it arrived changed -- timestamps inverted, frequencies bent into harmonic ghosts of themselves. [63] The Consortium had placed Maren there because she was their best celestial signal interpreter, trained to decode the electromagnetic whispers of pulsars, magnetars, and deep-field phenomena that no algorithm could parse. [90] What they hadn't told her was that the Locus didn't just distort signals passing through it. [105] It distorted signals passing back. [110]

She discovered this after planting the wrong seeds. [118] Her early interpretations -- confident, precise, filed without hesitation -- had traveled downstream to navigation arrays across three colonial sectors. [134] A pulsar she'd classified as dormant turned out to be cycling. [144] A frequency she'd labeled background noise was a gravitational tide warning. [155] Two ships adjusted course based on her reports. [163] One arrived safely at the wrong destination. [170] The other arrived at the right destination six hours before it had departed. [182]

That was when Maren understood what the Locus could do to causality. [193] And that was when she found the pen. [201]

It had been wedged behind a bulkhead panel, left by some previous interpreter whose name had been scrubbed from the rotation logs. [222] A dried-up fountain pen with an exotic nib -- iridium-tipped, split in a way she'd never seen, like a serpent's tongue. [243] There was no ink, but when she held it over her old reports inside the Locus's core chamber, the nib hummed against the paper as if tasting what had been written. [273] She pressed down and drew a single line through her dormant-pulsar classification. [285] The paper accepted a mark that wasn't ink but something more like absence, a careful subtraction of meaning. [301]

The next morning, the colonial relay pinged an updated nav-log. [311] The two ships had never changed course. [318]

She told no one. [322] She was confidently uncertain about what she'd done -- sure of the mechanism, unsure of the cost. [337] Editing history, she learned, was not like erasing a mistake on a draft. [350] It was like pulling a thread from a tapestry and watching the surrounding threads shift to compensate, creating a pattern that was different but still whole. [374] The method operated through contingent relationships: each event connected to others not by iron chains of causation but by softer dependencies, things that could have gone either way and now simply went the other way. [407] A ship that never diverted meant a crew that never questioned their signal interpreter, which meant Maren's reputation remained intact, which meant the Consortium never sent the review board, which meant she stayed alone at the Locus with the pen and the pooling silence of bent time. [451]

She began to unbend things. [456] Not just her errors but the Locus's own distortions, straightening tangled signals with careful strokes of the dry nib, restoring transmissions to what they would have been if spacetime hadn't folded them into riddles. [488] She unbent her own spine too, metaphorically and literally, sitting straighter at the console now that she understood her work was not mere translation but authorship. [514] The isolation no longer crushed her. [520] It held her. [523]

Strange comfort settled into her days like sediment in still water. [533] She was alone with the power to revise the past, and she found she didn't want to use it recklessly. [552] Each correction taught her something. [557] A signal wasn't just data; it was a moment someone had transmitted with intent, a flare of meaning cast into the void. [577] To edit it was to engage in conversation with that intent, to ask what it had really been trying to say. [596] This was her motivation now, sharper than duty, quieter than ambition: to thresh meaning from experience, to separate what mattered from what was noise. [620]

The pen would run out eventually. [626] Not of ink -- it had never had ink -- but of whatever quality the Locus lent it, that resonance with contingency. [645] She could feel it growing lighter, the hum against the paper growing faint. [658] Someday she would make her last edit and the past would become as fixed as everyone else believed it always had been. [679]

But not today. [682] Today there was a signal coming in from the Vela remnant, folded seven ways by the anomaly, and Maren held the pen above a fresh page and listened. [709] She was confidently uncertain, as always. [716] Sure that the signal meant something. [722] Unsure what it would mean once she was done with it. [732]

She pressed the nib to the page and began. [741]
