The eels moved differently after friction disappeared. [7]

They had always been slippery creatures, but now they drifted like silk ribbons through currents that no longer knew resistance, gliding across wet stone as though the world had forgotten how to hold anything in place. [40]

Maren watched them from the tidal bluff, her bare feet braced against rock she could barely grip, and counted their spiraling paths the way her mentor once taught her—looking for sacred patterns in the chaos of living things. [76]

She was the last eel herder on the northern coast, and she preferred it that way. [91] Elusive by necessity, not temperament. [96] The visions had made her that way. [102]

Maren was precognitively cursed. [106] She had seen the Unmooring three years before it arrived—friction dissolving like salt in warm water, the fundamental force that held boots to ground and hands to rope simply withdrawing from the world. [136] She had told everyone she could reach. [142] They called her mad, then desperate, then dangerous. [150] When it finally happened, when the oceans began sliding sideways and buildings shed their contents like trees shedding leaves, no one came to apologize. [171] They just came begging. [175]

She turned them away. [179] Not from cruelty. [183] From a lingering promise she could not break. [190]

Her mentor, old Thessaly, had pressed a leather pouch into Maren's palm on her deathbed—collapsed star dust, impossibly dense and faintly warm, harvested from a crater where something ancient had fallen centuries ago. [222] "You'll know what it's for," Thessaly had whispered. [230] "When the world starts sliding, you'll understand the patterns. [238] Promise me you'll try." [242]

Maren had promised. [245] That promise had not faded. [250] It lived in her chest like a second heartbeat, steady and insistent, pulling her back to the bluff each night when the aurora ignited overhead. [273]

Tonight the lights were extraordinary—green and violet curtains rippling across a sky that seemed closer than it should be, as though heaven itself was losing its grip. [299] The borrowed dawn they cast across the headland turned everything the color of bruised gold, and in that uncertain light Maren knelt and began her work. [327]

She opened the pouch. [331] The collapsed star dust caught the aurora and held it, each grain dense enough to bend light around its edges. [349] She had spent months learning to harness its energy, and the method she had discovered was stranger than anything Thessaly could have imagined. [372]

Painted rocks. [374] Dozens of them, each marked with pigments Maren ground from shells and lichen—spirals, dots, intersecting lines in ochre and indigo and bone white. [396] She placed them along the bluff's edge in mathematical sequences: Fibonacci chains, prime number intervals, golden-ratio arcs that mirrored the eels' spiraling paths below. [420] Each stone clicked into position against the rock face, one of the few sounds left in a frictionless world where most things simply slid past each other in silence. [448]

When the sequence was complete, she poured a thin line of star dust along the pattern's spine. [464]

The effect was immediate. [468] The aurora overhead bent, drawn downward like water finding a channel, and the painted rocks began to glow with that same borrowed dawn—light that was not hers, not the sun's, not anything natural, but something lent from the deep geometry of the universe itself. [506]

The sacred patterns revealed themselves. [511] In the glowing sequence, Maren could see what Thessaly had always believed—that friction was not merely a force but a rhythm the world followed, and it could be rewritten. [540] The spirals of the eels, the intervals of the tides, the Fibonacci curves of shells and storms—they were all expressions of the same underlying structure, and that structure could be restored. [568]

But the curse showed her something too. [575] A vision, unbidden and sharp: the pattern completing itself, friction returning, and Maren standing at its center, turned to stone—the final painted rock in the sequence. [601]

She had always known the promise would cost her everything. [610] Thessaly must have known it too. [616]

Maren placed her hand flat against the star dust and felt the warmth of that ancient collapse, that dying star's last compression into something small and permanent. [641] Below her the eels spiraled in their perfect arcs, unbothered by a world without friction, following patterns older than gravity. [660]

She closed her eyes. [664] The aurora pulsed. [667] The borrowed dawn spread its fragile gold across her skin. [676]

"I promised," she said to no one, to Thessaly, to the turning sky. [688]

Then she placed the final stone. [694]
