The first thing Adaeze noticed when she descended into the catacomb orchard was that the roots had learned to love the dead. [22]

They threaded through ribcages like fingers lacing together, cradled skulls in pale wooden palms, and drew from the ancient calcium a sweetness she could taste in the air -- faintly mineral, faintly floral. [54] Above, somewhere past the vaulted stone ceiling, the fruit trees of Nri stood heavy with their impossible harvest, fed by centuries of buried ancestors. [75] She had not seen those trees since she was seven years old, when her parents had carried her away to London, interrupting a journey she had not known she was on. [101]

Now she was thirty-four, a diaspora returnee with a British passport and a hollow place behind her sternum where faith used to live. [122] Her grandmother had been a priestess of Ala, the earth deity, and Adaeze remembered almost nothing of the rituals -- only the feeling, the warmth of belonging to something rooted. [149] That warmth had faded across years of concrete and drizzle until she could no longer feel it at all. [167] She had come back to Nri to excavate the tomb of her grandmother's grandmother, to recover what the family had left behind. [189]

The archaeological team had given her a volunteer's lantern and a soft brush, and then mostly forgotten her. [207] She moved through the catacomb orchard with purposeful wandering, following whichever root system called to her, brushing soil from bones that were not yet the bones she sought. [236] Each alcove revealed a different conversation between tree and body: here an ulna wrapped in tendrils of fig, there a pelvis crowned with the white shoots of a kola nut sapling. [265] She catalogued them not with a scientist's detachment but with a warmly curious reverence, pressing her palm against the cool stone walls and asking silent questions. [292]

On the third day of excavation, her brush uncovered something that was not bone. [306] It was stone, carved in a circle, with radiating hour lines etched into its surface and a shallow socket at its center where a gnomon had once stood. [334] A sundial base, buried among the dead as though time itself had been laid to rest. [349]

Dr. Okafor, the lead archaeologist, crouched beside her and sucked air through his teeth. [363] "We have oral records of these," he said. [370] "The priestesses kept sundials in the catacombs to mark ritual hours. [381] When the British banned the old religion, the families buried the instruments with their dead rather than surrender them." [396]

Adaeze turned the base over in her hands. [404] The stone was warm -- warmer than it should have been, underground, in December. [416] She thought of her grandmother's hands, which had always been warm, even in the hospital at the end. [433] She thought of every interrupted journey: her family's flight from tradition, the suppression of the priestesses, the sundial wrenched from sunlight and swallowed by earth. [456]

"I want to rebuild it," she said. [463]

Dr. Okafor studied her face. [468] "The gnomon would have been iron. [474] We can cast one from the local smith." [481]

Over the following days, as the team continued excavating deeper into the tomb, Adaeze worked to restore the sundial. [498] She cleaned the base with lemon water, tracing each hour line with her fingertip until she had memorized the geometry. [517] The smith in the village above forged a new gnomon from reclaimed iron, and when she fitted it into the socket, it clicked home with a satisfaction that resonated in her chest. [548]

She carried the completed sundial up through the catacomb passage and into the orchard above, where the fruit trees stood in rows over their subterranean dead. [574] She placed it on a flat stone between a mango and an iroko, and the gnomon caught the afternoon sun and cast its first shadow in perhaps a hundred years. [603]

The shadow moved, as shadows do, with a patience that made her breath slow. [617] She watched it creep across the ancient hour lines, and she felt something stir in the hollow place behind her sternum -- not the full warmth of her grandmother's faith, not yet, but the cautious enchantment of a flame finding kindling. [654]

The roots beneath her feet still held their dead. [663] The sundial still told its interrupted hours. [670] And Adaeze, who had wandered purposefully through catacombs and continents to arrive at this single point of light, knelt in the orchard soil and pressed her palms flat against the earth, the way she had seen her grandmother do in a memory she thought she had lost. [713]

The ground was warm. [717]

It had been waiting. [721]
