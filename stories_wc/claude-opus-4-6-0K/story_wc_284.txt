The mist lay over Zephyr Bluff like a silver hush, softening every edge of the world until the pines became ghosts and the granite lip of the cliff dissolved into nothing. [32]

Maren climbed the switchback trail at dawn, her breath visible in the cold that still held the mountains at the tilt of the earth toward spring. [58] Snow lingered in the shadows between rocks, though the south-facing slopes had already begun to thaw, revealing dark soil and the first pale shoots of crocuses pressing upward. [87] She moved carefully, favoring her left side where the burn scars pulled tight beneath her jacket. [101] Two years since Varna, since the safehouse fire that took her cover, her network, and most of the skin on her left arm and torso. [124] Two years since the agency had labeled her a burned spy in every sense of the word and reassigned her to a desk she never occupied. [148]

She had not come back to Zephyr Bluff for the agency. [159] She had come for herself, to find where unused courage waits when a person has spent too long afraid of her own reflection. [181]

In her coat pocket, her fingers turned the engraved pillbox that had belonged to her handler, Dmitri. [196] Its lid bore a micro-etching of a compass rose, and inside, instead of pills, a slip of onion-skin paper held a cipher key he had pressed into her hand the night before Varna. [230] "For the messages I cannot send any other way," he had told her. [243] She had not understood then. [248]

She understood now. [251]

The dead drop was here, on the bluff, encoded not in chalk marks or magnetized containers but in something Dmitri had devised during the years he spent stationed in these mountains: codes in accumulated snow. [284] Patterns of disturbance -- compacted lines, deliberate footprints in precise sequences, small objects half-buried at measured intervals -- that could be read only by someone who possessed the cipher key and arrived before the thaw erased everything. [316] It was prudently daring, his signature method: bold in concept, meticulous in execution. [329] The snow itself became the message and its own self-destructing medium. [340]

Maren reached the bluff's flat summit where the mist pooled thickest. [351] She knelt and studied the snowfield that remained in the shadow of a granite outcrop. [366] At first, nothing. [369] Then her trained eye caught the regularities: seven small stones placed in a curved line, spacing uneven but deliberate. [385] Boot prints pressed to specific depths. [391] A branch snapped and set at an angle. [399]

She opened the pillbox, unfolded the onion-skin, and began to decode. [411]

The message was short. [415] Dmitri had left coordinates, a date three weeks hence, and a single phrase that made her throat tighten: "Vouchsafe this to no one but the woman I trained." [440] He was alive. [443] He was asking her to come in from the cold of her own exile and meet him, not as a broken agent but as the operative he still believed she was. [472]

She sat back on her heels, the mist curling around her like a living thing. [487] The scars ached in the chill. [493] She thought about the desk she'd abandoned, the apartment she'd barely furnished, the mirror she'd covered with a bedsheet. [511] All the architecture of avoidance she had built so carefully. [521]

Fixing what's broken, she thought, does not mean restoring what was. [532] It means building something that can bear the weight of what happened. [544]

She memorized the coordinates, then methodically scattered the stones and swept the snow smooth with her forearm, erasing Dmitri's message as the season itself would have done within days. [573] The pillbox went back into her pocket. [580] She stood, facing the edge of the bluff where the mist thinned just enough to reveal a pale band of light on the eastern horizon -- the sun finding its way through, tentative, persistent. [611]

She would go to the coordinates. [617] She would carry the cipher key and her scarred body and whatever courage had been accumulating in the silence of these two lost years. [639] She would not pretend the fire had never happened, nor that she was the same woman who had walked into that Varna safehouse believing herself untouchable. [663]

She was touchable. [666] She had been touched by the worst of it and was still climbing. [678]

Maren descended Zephyr Bluff as the mist began to lift, each step carrying her closer to the world below, where spring waited with its quiet, relentless insistence on beginning again. [706]
