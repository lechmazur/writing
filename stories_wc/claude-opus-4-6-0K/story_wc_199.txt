In the ashen skyborne arbor, where roots clutched nothing but cloud and charcoal air, Wren sorted seeds by shape, by weight, by the faint hum each one made when she held it close to her ear. [36]

She had always been orderly about it. [43] The arbor demanded precision — its pale branches grew only what was planted with intention, and a misplaced seed could sprout nightshade where there should have been sage. [69] Wren kept her workbench immaculate, each compartment labeled in her careful hand, each seed nestled into its proper hollow like a tooth returned to a jaw. [93]

But lately the leaves had been falling wrong. [101]

Not downward — nothing fell downward here, where the arbor hung suspended in its canopy of smoke and memory — but sideways, in spirals, in patterns that nagged at her like a word caught between languages. [134] Regional folklore held that the arbor's leaves carried messages from the old ones, the root-speakers who had planted the first skyborne tree before the ground became ash. [160] The stories said that during the hush where past meets prophecy, when the arbor neither grew nor shed but simply held its breath, the leaves would arrange themselves into sentences only the devoted could read. [193]

Wren believed this the way moss believes in stone: utterly, without argument, by growing toward it. [208]

She had spent eleven seasons trying to decode the message in falling leaves. [221] Each autumn she charted their trajectories, pressed them between sheets of bark-paper, and compared their veins to the old alphabets. [239] Each autumn she came close to something — a phrase, a warning, a name — and each autumn the meaning slipped through like water through roots. [262]

This season, though, she had found the speck. [270]

It sat on her sorting tray one morning, caught between a fennel seed and a sliver of dried thyme: a single dust-sized fragment of moonstone cabochon, no larger than a breath condensed. [300] Under her magnifying lens it shimmered with that particular opalescent patience that moonstone always carried, as if it had been waiting longer than she had. [324]

She did what she always did with forgotten things. [333] She built it a monument. [338]

On her workbench, beside rows of sorted seeds, Wren constructed tiny monuments to forgotten things — cairns of pebble and thorn, arches of dried stem, small altars where the overlooked could be remembered. [367] She had built monuments to lost varietals, to unnamed beetles, to the echo of a song her mother used to hum. [389] Now she built one for the moonstone speck: two crossed twigs for a foundation, a curl of bark for a roof, and the dust mote placed at the center like a heart. [420]

The moment she set it down, a leaf spiraled past her face. [432] She caught it without thinking and turned it over. [441] Its veins spelled something. [445] Not almost-something, not nearly-something. [449] Something. [450]

She prodded the monument gently with her fingertip, adjusting the speck's position, and another leaf fell, then another. [468] Each one she caught. [472] Each one she read. [476] The message assembled itself the way dawn assembles light — gradually, then all at once. [489]

It said: You are the seed I sorted last. [498] Plant yourself. [500]

Wren sat very still in the hush where past meets prophecy, feeling the arbor hold its breath around her. [518] The ash-gray branches above her seemed to lean closer, expectant, dressed in their pale moss like old women in green shawls. [539] She looked at her monuments, her careful rows, her eleven seasons of devotion, and she understood that the message had never been in the leaves. [562] The leaves had been waiting for her to become someone who could hear them. [575]

She pressed her palms into the soil of her workbench — that thin, precious layer of earth she had carried up from the ruined ground — and felt something shift in her chest, a cracking open, the way a shell must feel when the shoot finally pushes through. [617]

When Wren stood again, she emerged transformed, as she always did — not dramatically, not with fire or thunder, but in that quiet way of moss reclaiming stone. [646] Her fingers were darker, root-threaded. [651] Her eyes held the opalescent shimmer of moonstone. [659] She was still an orderly seed sorter, still devoted to her tiny monuments and her careful rows. [674] But now the leaves fell toward her like children running home, and she could read every single one, and each one tasted of mossy delight, of green things growing in gray places, of the ancient folklore finally finding its living voice. [710]

She picked up her magnifying lens and returned to work. [720] There were seeds to sort. [725] There were always seeds to sort. [731] But now she sorted them while singing, and the arbor, at last, sang back. [745]
