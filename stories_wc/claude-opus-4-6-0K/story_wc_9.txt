She had climbed above the world to find what the world had taken from her.

The midnight glade floated on a shelf of granite that pierced the cloud line, and everything below was erased — every road, every rooftop, every cradle she had left behind. [44] Only starlight touched the alpine grass here, and it touched it so gently that each blade seemed to glow from within, a luminescence that made her throat ache. [71] Maren set down her satchel and breathed the thin, sweet air until her ribs hurt. [85]

She was an onyx-ink cartomancer by trade, a reader of futures painted in pigment so black it swallowed lamplight. [101] Her cards lay in the satchel now, each one hand-pressed with ink she had rendered from charred bone and oak gall. [121] For years she had turned them for strangers, mapping their tomorrows with confident hands. [135] But after the birth — after her daughter arrived five weeks early, after the hemorrhage, after the hours she could not account for between the operating table and waking — Maren discovered that her own future had gone silent. [168] The cards she drew for herself came up blank, slick and dark as wet stone. [183]

Something had been taken. [187] Not blood, not strength, but time itself: the minutes she had lost under anesthesia, and then more minutes after that, leaking from her days like water through a crack in porcelain. [215] She would blink and an hour would be gone. [224] She would nurse the baby and look up to find the sun had crossed the sky. [238] Her mother, visiting, noticed it first. [244]

"You're drifting," her mother said, and pressed Maren's hand flat against the tablecloth. [257] It was a family custom — tracing hands on birthday tablecloths, one outline per year, so you could see how you had grown. [278] Her mother had brought the old linen from home, cream-colored and covered in the ghosts of small palms. [295] She traced Maren's adult hand beside the five-year-old's outline and frowned. [306] "Your fingers are shorter," she whispered. [312]

That was when Maren understood. [317] The lost time was accumulating somewhere, and it was pulling her backward, shrinking her. [330] She had to find where it gathered before it unmade her entirely. [342]

The cards, when she begged them, gave her one image: a glade above clouds, a place of cloudbound repentance where debts of consciousness were repaid. [365] She did not understand, and she climbed willingly perplexed, carrying her satchel and one other object — a dolls' tea set saucer, porcelain, fractured down the center by a hairline crack. [396] It had been her daughter's first gift, broken within a week. [407] She kept it because the crack reminded her of the fissure in her own continuity, the seam where her time had split open. [428]

Now, in the glade, she knelt and laid the saucer on the grass. [441] Starlight pooled in its shallow bowl. [447] She drew a card and this time the onyx ink moved, swirling into the shape of a hand — small, newborn, unmistakable. [467] Her daughter's hand. [470]

The truth arrived like a fist behind the sternum. [479] The lost time had not been stolen. [486] She had given it, unconsciously, in that space between tables — poured her hours into the child who needed them more, whose early arrival had left her short of days. [514] Every blank hour Maren could not remember had been spent in a currency she hadn't known she was paying, buying her daughter's breath, her daughter's heartbeat, her daughter's time in the world. [546]

Maren's eyes burned. [549] The glade was so beautiful it was choking — the stars, the luminous grass, the silence that rang like crystal. [567] She pressed the cracked saucer against her chest and felt the fracture line warm beneath her fingers. [582]

Repentance, the cards had said. [587] Not punishment. [589] Repentance: the willingness to look at what you have done and call it yours. [603]

She reached behind her neck and began to unfasten the chain that held her oldest card — the first she had ever inked, the one she wore as a talisman. [631] She laid it on the grass beside the saucer. [641] Ink bled from its surface into the earth, and she felt time rush back into her like air into a bellows, warm and enormous. [663]

She would return lighter. [667] She would return shorter of magic and full of minutes. [677] She would trace her daughter's hand on the birthday tablecloth and watch the outline grow, year after year, in the space her sacrifice had made possible. [703]

She packed the saucer carefully, crack and all, and began the long descent through clouds that parted around her like curtains drawn open on a new, uncharted morning. [732]
