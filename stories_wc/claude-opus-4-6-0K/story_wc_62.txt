The greenhouse had stood for two hundred years at the edge of the Monarch corridor, its iron bones laced with glass so old it rippled like water frozen mid-pour. [30] Every autumn, when the butterflies threaded south in their millions, Elara Voss came here at dusk to carve. [46]

She was a gravestone carver by trade, but thoughtful in a way that slowed her chisel to a crawl. [63] Each letter she cut was a question she posed to the dead: What shape does your absence leave in the living? [82] She had spent eleven years trying to discover the shape of collective grief, the geometry that emerges when a whole community loses someone at once. [105] Not a single headstone had answered her. [112]

But the greenhouse had begun to. [118]

It started the previous migration, when Elara found the woven ribbon roll tucked behind a cracked propagation tray. [134] The ribbon was dense silk, hand-dyed in bands of indigo and saffron, wound tight as a fist. [151] Stitched along its inner edge in faded thread were lines of poetry, dozens of them, each in a different hand. [170] She recognized her grandmother's writing first, then her mother's, then several strangers'. [181] The poems were fragments traded at family dinners, a custom she remembered from childhood: everyone brought a favorite poem to the table, read it aloud, and copied it onto the communal ribbon before passing the bread. [213]

She had not thought of that custom in years. [222] Its rediscovery broke something open in her chest. [231]

Now, in the second October, Elara sat cross-legged on the greenhouse floor among ferns that had outlived their keeper, fiercely meditative, her breathing so controlled that the monarchs drifting through the broken roof panes settled on her shoulders without fear. [268] Dusk poured in like copper smoke. [274] She unrolled the ribbon across her lap, reading each poem again, and the greenhouse filled with a thundering calm, the paradox of silence so full it roared. [300]

That was when the specter appeared. [306]

Her grandmother, Marguerite, materialized the way steam rises from tea, gradual and without apology. [320] She did not glow or shimmer. [326] She simply occupied space the way the dead do in greenhouses at dusk: with the authority of someone who once grew roses in this exact soil. [351]

"You're trying to carve what you haven't yet traced," Marguerite said. [362]

Elara did not startle. [366] She had been expecting this, or something like it, since the ribbon surfaced. [379] "I don't know where to begin," she admitted. [387]

"Retrace," Marguerite said. [390] "Go back through the poems. Each one was chosen because it held a piece of someone's grief. The ribbon is a map." [410]

So began the spectral mentorship. [415] Across the weeks of the butterfly migration, Marguerite appeared each dusk in the greenhouse, guiding Elara through the ribbon poem by poem. [436] She explained who had chosen each verse and why. [445] Uncle Theodor had offered Rilke the autumn after his son drowned. [456] Cousin Lise had brought Szymborska the year the factory closed and forty families scattered. [469] Elara's own mother had once read Dickinson's "After great pain, a formal feeling comes" into a silence so total that the candles seemed to lean in. [494]

Each poem was a headstone no one had commissioned. [503] Each dinner had been a funeral no one named. [512]

Elara began to carve differently. [517] She brought her chisel to the greenhouse and worked on a single slab of Vermont slate by the failing light. [536] She did not cut names or dates. [542] Instead she carved the poems from the ribbon in a spiral that began at the stone's center and wound outward, each line in the handwriting of the person who had chosen it, which she reconstructed from the stitched thread with painstaking care. [581]

The monarchs thinned as November approached. [587] Marguerite grew fainter. [590] On the last evening, the specter stood behind Elara and looked at the finished stone. [604]

"What shape is it?" Elara asked. [610]

"You already know." [613]

Elara ran her fingers along the spiral. [620] It was not a circle, not a line, not an absence. [630] It was a widening gyre, each grief opening into the next, never closing, never repeating, but always connected by the thread of someone choosing a poem and handing it across bread and candlelight to someone they loved. [665]

The shape of collective grief was a conversation that never ended. [676]

Marguerite dissolved with the last butterfly. [682] Elara rolled the ribbon tight, placed it beside the stone, and walked home through the dark to set the table for dinner. [703] She had a poem to bring. [709]
