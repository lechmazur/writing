The grave had been modest, which was the insult Wren couldn't forgive. [12]

A small granite marker near the trailhead below Elkhorn Peak, her name spelled correctly, the dates spanning a life she hadn't finished living yet. [37] She'd stumbled on it three days ago during a routine survey of the fire roads, and since then she'd been barricaded inside the ranger cabin, filling birch bark scrolls with everything she could pull from the wreckage of her sleeping mind. [71]

Wren had been a lucid dream chronicler for eleven years, which meant she'd spent more than a third of her life navigating the architecture of her own subconscious and writing down what she found. [101] Most chroniclers kept leather journals or digital logs. [109] Wren preferred birch bark because the dreams felt older than paper, older than language, and deserved a surface that understood rot. [129]

The cabin smelled like pine pitch and mouse droppings, and the November wind pushed through gaps in the chinking with a sound like someone shushing a child. [155] She sat cross-legged on the cot, a headlamp casting its clinical circle on the curl of bark in her lap, and she wrote in the careful shorthand she'd developed over a decade of transcription. [189]

Last night's dream: she was twenty-three again, standing on the granite spine of a ridge she'd summited that summer she'd worked in the Cascades. [213] The twenty-three-year-old version of her had laughed at the exposure, the thousand-foot drop on either side, and then leaped and begun to soar over the valley with arms outstretched, thermals catching her like she was made of nothing heavier than want. [254]

Wren had watched from somewhere outside the dream's frame, lucid enough to observe, too anchored to participate. [271] She'd felt it then, the thing she'd started calling feral nostalgia, a longing so raw and untamed it had teeth. [292] Not the gentle ache of missing the past but something predatory, something that stalked through her chest and tore at whatever membrane separated remembering from becoming. [317]

She was jealous of the woman on the ridge. [326] She was jealous of the version of herself who hadn't yet herniated a disc hauling radio equipment, who hadn't yet buried a dog, who hadn't yet walked past a stone with her own death chiseled into it. [363] That Wren could soar because she didn't know she would land. [374]

The chronology had been scrambled ever since the grave. [383] She couldn't remember if the Cascades summer came before or after the winter she'd spent in the Boundary Waters, couldn't place her mother's surgery on any reliable timeline, couldn't say with certainty whether she'd learned to read a topographic map at twelve or fifteen. [422] Her life had become a deck of cards thrown into wind, each memory a separate falling thing. [438]

This was why she wrote. [443] Not to remember but to distill chaos into narrative, to give the mess a spine and a direction, even a false one. [465] The birch bark scrolls piled on the cabin floor like shed skin, dozens of them now, each holding one dream rendered into sequence. [489] If she couldn't trust the order of her waking life, she could at least impose order on the sleeping one. [508]

She finished transcribing the soaring dream and set the scroll aside. [519] Through the cabin's single window, the peaks held the last grey light of afternoon like something they were embarrassed to return. [538] Beautiful, she supposed, in the way that everything was beautiful when you'd read your own expiration date: casually, exhaustingly, without relief. [556] Jaded wonder, she'd once called it in an old scroll. [565] The particular fatigue of being astonished by a world that had already scheduled your removal from it. [580]

She closed her eyes and began the breathing pattern that would carry her under. [593] Tonight she'd look for the version of herself who first came to this cabin, nineteen and sunburned, too young to know the mountains were indifferent. [616] She'd watch that girl build a fire with green wood and curse the smoke and believe that competence was something you could accumulate like a fortune. [640] She'd be jealous, and she'd write it down, and the bark would hold the dream the way the granite held her name: without opinion, without tenderness, but permanently. [668]

The wind shushed. [671] Wren slept. [673] Somewhere below the trailhead, the grave waited with the patience of all finished things, but in the country behind her eyes, every version of her was still alive, still confused about the order of their joy, still capable of leaping from high places and finding, for a few unearned seconds, that the air would hold them.
