She had been the library's guardian for so long that her body had forgotten the posture of civilization. [18] Her spine curved like a question mark over the frozen garden's stone bench, fingers blackened with old ink and older frost, nostrils flaring at scents that carried information the way books once did. [47] The mist lay thick across the garden, turning every hedge into a suggestion and every statue into a rumor of itself. [65] She was feral now, yes, but feral the way a theorem is feral when it escapes the textbook and begins proving things on its own. [86]

The garden had been frozen for three seasons or three centuries. [96] She could not remember which. [101] Time here moved through the veil of sleep, that liminal smear where minutes taste like hours and hours dissolve into the moisture on your tongue. [123] The roses were locked mid-bloom, their petals rigid with ice, and the fountain's arc of water had become a glass bridge to nowhere. [146] Mist rolled between the topiary like breath between teeth. [155]

She waited. [157]

Waiting was her primary technology, her deepest craft. [165] She had learned to wait the way rivers learn to wait -- not passively, but with the patient erosion of everything that is not waiting. [188] The library behind her, its doors sealed with frost and silence, contained books that described dimensions she had once called home. [208] She was dimensionally homesick in a way that lived beneath her ribs like a second heartbeat, a constant ache for geometries this world's light could not render. [233] The angles were wrong here. [238] The shadows fell in only two directions. [245] Where she came from, light had boundaries that you could touch, walls of luminance that divided one quality of seeing from another, and she missed pressing her palms against those warm, humming edges. [273]

The boundaries of light in this frozen garden were softer, more negotiable. [284] Mist blurred where brightness ended and shadow began until the whole world became a single gradient of gray. [301] She had learned to survive this by interiorizing exteriors -- taking the garden's fog into her lungs, the cold into her marrow, the silence into the space between her thoughts, until the boundary between herself and the frozen world grew as indistinct as the mist itself. [344] It was how she guarded the library without locks. [353] She had become the perimeter. [358]

Today something new rested in the frost. [365]

She found it beside the sealed fountain: a pendant on a tarnished chain, its face inscribed with symbols that made her teeth ache with recognition. [388] A cultist's pendant. [391] She had seen their kind before, the robed figures who came seeking the library's forbidden indices, who believed they could open doors between dimensions by reciting the right syllables in the right sequence. [420] They were always wrong about the syllables but occasionally right about the doors. [432]

She held the pendant to the mist-light and watched the symbols shift. [443] They were coordinates, she realized. [448] Not to her home dimension -- the angles were still wrong for that -- but to somewhere adjacent, somewhere the light might have three boundaries instead of this world's formless two. [476] Her throat tightened. [479]

She could use it. [483] She could leave. [486]

But the library. [489]

She crouched in the frost and pressed the pendant against her sternum, feeling its cold become her cold, interiorizing this exterior too. [510] The symbols sank through skin and settled near that second heartbeat, and she understood something she had been circling for all those frozen seasons. [533]

To make friends with uncertainty was not to resolve it. [543] It was to sit with the pendant's promise and the library's need and the mist's refusal to clarify, and to find that the sitting itself was a kind of home. [572] The homesickness did not vanish. [577] It became a room she could furnish. [584]

She placed the pendant on the fountain's frozen arc, where it hung like a second moon in the gray air. [603] Let it stay visible. [607] Let the next cultist come and find it and make their own choice about doors. [621] She would be here, waiting in the foggy lucidity of a mind that had stopped demanding answers from the mist. [640]

The garden breathed its slow, cold breath. [647] The roses held their frozen bloom. [653] Somewhere behind the sealed doors, the books whispered their patient geometries, and she listened with the whole perimeter of her being, guardian and garden and the soft, negotiable edge where light became something else entirely. [684]

She waited, and the waiting was enough. [691]
