The foghorn had been sounding for three days straight, a moan that pressed against the glass walls of the orchard garden like a living thing. [27] When it finally fell silent, the quiet was worse. [36]

Mordecai Thane, venerable oath scribe to institutions that no longer existed, stood among the ancient apple trees on the seventy-second floor and felt the silence settle into his bones. [63] The trees were gnarled and impossibly old, their roots threaded through hydroponic channels that hummed with nutrients, their branches heavy with fruit no one ever picked. [88] The garden had been planted by the building's original architects as a monument to impermanence — living things clinging to steel, soil imported from six dead civilizations. [112] Mordecai understood the sentiment. [116] He had spent his life transcribing oaths in languages whose last native speakers had turned to dust centuries ago. [133]

He speaks dead languages the way other men breathe — involuntarily, constantly, the Sumerian and Hittite and Old Elamite murmuring beneath his English like water beneath ice. [158] It was this quality that had brought him here, to the rooftop orchard maintained by the Caravel Institute, whose directors wanted him to do something unprecedented: archive emotional patterns. [184] Not thoughts, not words, but the specific textures of human feeling, transcribed into phonetic systems so ancient they predated the separation of concept from sound. [208]

They believed, and Mordecai was beginning to believe, that the oldest languages carried emotional resonance in their very phonemes — that grief sounded like grief before anyone had a word for it. [239]

He lifted the object from its velvet-lined case: a wax cylinder phonograph shaving, curled like a dark fingernail, recovered from a 1903 recording session in which a Cornish woman had sung the last known hymn in her dying tongue. [277] The shaving was a fragment, a few seconds of audio at most, but when Mordecai had played it on the Institute's restored phonograph, he had wept without understanding why. [306]

That was when the memory surfaced. [312]

Third grade. [314] A field trip to a botanical garden where a docent had handed each child a sprig of rosemary and said, "Smell this and you'll remember today forever." [340] Mordecai had crushed the sprig too hard, and the oil had stung his eyes, and through the tears the garden had looked like it was underwater. [367] He remembered thinking: this is what it feels like to be inside something. [380] Not looking at it. [384] Inside it. [387]

Now, decades later, he understood that the child had stumbled onto the method. [399] To archive emotion, one could not observe it. [408] One had to immerse. [412]

He placed the wax shaving on the workbench beside his transcription ledger and began to chant. [427] The words were proto-Elamite, sounds that meant "to enter" and "to dissolve" and something untranslatable that linguists glossed as "the space between heartbeats." [450] The apple trees shivered, though there was no wind at this altitude. [462] Fog pressed against the glass dome overhead, pearl-gray and intimate. [472]

What happened next, Mordecai had not intended. [480] The transcription he produced — the emotional pattern of that Cornish woman's grief rendered in cuneiform-adjacent script — contained a phrase that, when read aloud, described an event that had not yet occurred. [510] A flood. [512] A specific flood, in a specific city, on a date still three months away. [525] He recognized it as prophecy only because the old oath formulas he'd spent his life transcribing had taught him what prophecy looked like: it arrived sideways, disguised as something else. [553] An accidental prophecy, born from the attempt to capture sorrow. [563]

He set down his stylus. [568] The orchard garden hummed around him, ancient fruit and recycled air and the velvet disquiet of knowing too much. [586] Below, the city was a grid of lights softened by fog. [597] Somewhere down there, people lived in the path of water that had not yet risen. [613]

Mordecai Thane had only wanted to prove that emotion could be preserved in dead syllables. [628] Instead, he had learned that feeling, pressed hard enough into language, becomes prediction — that the Cornish woman's grief contained the shape of future sorrows she could not have known. [657]

He picked up the wax shaving, held it to the light, and saw in its dark curve the same distortion he had seen through rosemary tears as a child: the world not as it was, but as it would become. [697]

He began a new transcription. [702] This time, he would archive not just the emotion but the warning nested inside it, writing in a language dead long enough to be trustworthy, hoping someone alive would think to read it. [736]

The fog thickened. [739] The apples hung heavy and untouched. [745] And in the silence after the foghorn, Mordecai wrote. [754]
