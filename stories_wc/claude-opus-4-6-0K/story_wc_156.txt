The sound wave garden had no flowers. Instead, it grew echoes. [11]

Parabolic dishes curved like enormous petals across the hillside, each one angled to catch and redirect sound in ways that turned whispered words into wandering ghosts. [38] Visitors would speak into one dish and hear their voice bloom from another thirty meters away, transformed by the geometry of reflection into something richer, stranger, more alive than the original utterance. [65]

Maren Solvik worked at the center of this acoustic labyrinth, though her official title had nothing to do with sound. [83] She was a mural restorer, hired by the municipality to repair the enormous painted wall that served as the garden's backdrop -- a sweeping depiction of concentric waves radiating from a single point, each ring containing smaller scenes that themselves contained smaller scenes, worlds nested inside worlds like the chambers of a nautilus shell. [134] Weather had eaten into the outermost layers, and Maren's job was to coax them back to visibility. [150]

She approached restoration the way she approached everything: methodically playful. [159] Her toolkit was organized with surgical precision, brushes ranked by width in millimeter increments, yet she hummed invented melodies while she worked and gave names to the cracks she filled. [186] Today she called the largest fissure "Thursday" because it branched in seven directions. [198]

It was while tracing Thursday's deepest branch that her trowel struck metal. [210] She extracted a small coin, no larger than her thumbnail, from the plaster. [223] Not a coin, exactly. [227] A hobo nickel -- a Buffalo nickel whose original face had been carved into something new by some anonymous hand decades ago. [246] The new face was a sleeping figure whose closed eyes contained tiny open eyes, which in turn contained tinier closed eyes, a recursive portrait of nested awakenings rendered in scratched metal. [275]

Maren turned it over. [279] On the reverse, where the buffalo should have been, someone had carved a single question mark. [293]

She pressed her thumb against it and felt the garden shift. [304]

Not physically. [306] The parabolic dishes still arced across the hillside, but the sounds they carried changed. [319] Her own breathing, caught by the nearest reflector, returned to her as a voice -- not hers, but familiar in the way that a half-remembered dream is familiar. [345] It asked: "What do you know for certain?" [352]

The question hung in the air, waiting. [359] And in the pause between question and reply, Maren felt something open inside her, a door she hadn't known was closed. [379] She realized she had spent years accumulating certainties -- the exact temperature at which gesso became workable, the precise angle of a restored brushstroke, the rigid grammar of her expertise -- and each certainty had been a small closing, a small sleep. [415]

The hobo nickel warmed in her palm. [422] The nested eyes on its face seemed to blink. [431]

She did not answer the question. [437] Instead, she whispered a question of her own into the nearest dish: "What don't I know?" [452]

The reflected sound carried her words across the garden, bending them through dish after dish, and each reflection stripped away a layer of the familiar. [476] By the time her voice returned, it was no longer a question but a tone, a resonance that seemed to bewitch the painted mural behind her. [500] Colors she had painstakingly restored began to pulse with a faint luminescence, and the nested scenes within the concentric waves started to move -- figures walking, water flowing, tiny suns rising inside smaller suns. [533]

Maren watched the innermost ring of the mural, where a painted woman stood before a painted wall, restoring a painted mural. [553] That woman looked up. [557] Their eyes met across the impossible distance between dimensions. [565]

The painted woman held up a tiny coin. [573]

Maren understood then that she was not the outermost ring. [583] She was nested too, one awakening inside another, and the real restoration had never been about plaster and pigment. [600] It was about peeling back the layers of what she thought she knew until she reached the raw surface beneath -- not knowledge, but wonder. [622]

She set down her trowel. [627] She placed the hobo nickel into Thursday's deepest crack and sealed it back into the wall with fresh plaster, a secret for the next restorer to find. [654] Then she walked to the center of the sound wave garden, stood among the parabolic dishes, and listened. [670]

The garden spoke in reflected echoes, layered and recursive, each sound containing the ghost of every sound that had preceded it. [690] Maren did not try to identify or catalog what she heard. [700] She let it wash through her, exchanging certainty for curiosity, expertise for astonishment. [712]

Somewhere inside the mural, the painted woman did the same. [722]

And somewhere beyond both of them, in a ring they could not see, another set of eyes opened. [739]
