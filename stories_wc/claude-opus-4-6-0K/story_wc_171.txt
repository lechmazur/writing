She had negotiated peace for longer than most civilizations remembered war. [12]

Maren climbed the final step of the ancient terrace, her boots finding the grooves worn by ten thousand years of feet that had ascended with the same desperate hope. [41] Midsummer light poured across the limestone like honey, gilding the cracks and the moss and the places where old blood had stained the stone into something almost beautiful. [68] The twin moons of Ardeth hung low on the horizon, beginning their slow dance toward conjunction — an alignment that occurred once every forty-three years, during which oaths sworn on this terrace could not be broken. [100]

That was the ritual significance of this place, this night. [110] Words spoken beneath converging moons became chains of celestial iron. [120]

She set the ebony clipboard on the altar stone at the terrace's center. [133] Its surface was scratched and nicked from decades of use, every mark a treaty, a ceasefire, a fragile architecture of compromise she had built between peoples who dreamed of each other's annihilation. [163] The clipboard held tonight's document: the Accord of Vashan, which would end the Forever War between the Selt Dominion and the Achori Free States — a conflict so old it had become identity, so embedded that children on both sides learned hate before they learned to read. [208]

Maren pressed her palms flat against the warm stone and breathed. [219] She was operatively gentle, had always been — not soft, never soft, but precise in her gentleness the way a surgeon is precise with a blade. [245] She had learned that rage could not build treaties, only rubble. [256] So she approached every warlord, every grieving mother, every calculating general with the same careful tenderness, listening first, always listening, until they felt heard enough to hear. [281]

It had cost her. [285] Three marriages dissolved by absence. [290] A daughter who called her by her title instead of her name. [301] Her left hand trembled now — nerve damage from the bombing at Kessith, where someone had decided peace was more dangerous than war. [322] She was riddled with flaws, held together by conviction the way the terrace was held together by root and ruin. [341] Flawed beauty, the Achori ambassador had once called her, meaning it as insult. [354] She had accepted it as truth. [360]

Now she needed to muster everything she had left. [369]

The delegations arrived separately, as protocol demanded. [376] General Tohn of the Selt, broad-shouldered and silent, his medals catching moonlight. [387] Speaker Ilessi of the Achori, thin as wire, her eyes carrying the particular fury of someone who had buried too many of her people. [409] They did not look at each other. [416] They looked at Maren. [420]

"You both know the price," Maren said. [427] Her voice carried across the terrace without effort, shaped by the acoustics ancient builders had carved into the stone. [445] "Redemption is not free. [449] The Selt will open the camps, release every Achori prisoner, acknowledge the displacement. [460] The Achori will disarm the border militias, surrender territorial claims on the Vashani corridor, and allow Selt settlers to remain." [478]

Tohn's jaw tightened. [481] Ilessi's hands curled into fists. [486]

"Each of you will lose something your people consider sacred," Maren continued. [497] "That is the price of redemption — not punishment, but surrender of the thing you clutch tightest." [513] She touched the ebony clipboard, running a finger along its edge. [523] "I have spent my life trying to anchor ideals in practice. [533] Peace is not an ideal. [538] It is a practice. [543] It is waking every morning and choosing not to answer blood with blood. [555] It is mundane and daily and it will bore you after the moons part and the weight of this oath settles into your bones." [577]

She lifted the document from the clipboard and placed it on the altar. [590]

Above them, the moons drew closer, their edges nearly kissing. [600] The light on the terrace shifted, doubled, casting everything in a strange luminance that erased shadows. [614]

"Sign now," Maren said, "or walk down those steps and teach your grandchildren to hate." [629]

Ilessi moved first. [632] Her signature was sharp, angular, furious. [638] Tohn followed, his hand steady, his face unreadable. [646]

The moons touched. [649] The terrace hummed with a frequency felt in the teeth, the chest, the marrow. [663] The oath sealed itself into the stone, the sky, the two names drying on parchment. [677]

Maren gathered the document and placed it back on the ebony clipboard. [689] Her hands were shaking. [693] They always shook afterward, when the adrenaline faded and the loneliness rushed back in. [706]

She descended the ancient steps alone, as she always did, carrying the clipboard against her chest like a shield, like a child, like proof that the broken could still build something that held. [740]

Behind her, the moons began their long, slow parting. [749]
