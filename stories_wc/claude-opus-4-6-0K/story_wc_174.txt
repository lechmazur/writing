The argument had ended three minutes ago, but its heat still clung to the curved walls of the decommissioned radar dome like smoke that refused to rise. [29]

Marcus Vey set down his brush pen and waited. [38] He was an urbane man, the kind of calligrapher whose letters appeared in gallery exhibitions and whose speech carried the measured cadence of someone who had learned that silence could be more articulate than shouting. [67] The others -- Dara, Jin, the puppeteers -- had scattered to their corners of the dome, and now the vast parabolic space held only the hush, that particular quiet that follows fury, dense and mineral-tasting, like the air before a meteor burns through atmosphere. [108]

He picked up the campfire story stick from the table. [118] It was a crooked length of driftwood, carved with notches by every storyteller who had held it at the residency. [137] Whoever gripped it spoke next. [142] That was the rule. [146]

Marcus turned the stick in his hands, running his thumb along the notches, and felt the half-lit understanding that had been flickering at the edges of his mind finally catch. [176] The argument had been about the puppet shows -- specifically, about whether their work in the seedy bars along the harbor district was exploitative or liberating. [199] Jin had accused Marcus of aestheticizing poverty. [206] Dara had countered that the audiences chose to come, that the subversion only worked because the bars were the last honest rooms in the city. [231] Marcus had said nothing, which Jin interpreted as condescension, and then the shouting started. [245]

Now, in the aftermath, Marcus understood something he could not have reached through debate. [259] The epiphany was not fully formed -- half-lit, like the dome itself, where the defunct radar panels let in slashes of coastal moonlight but left great arcs in shadow. [288] He understood that the question was never whether subversive puppet shows in seedy bars were ethical. [303] The question was whether any story told about someone else's suffering could be ethical, and if so, what reversed the flow of power from storyteller to subject. [329]

He stood, uncommonly serene for a man who had just been screamed at, and walked to the center of the dome where the old tracking pedestal served as their stage. [359] He set the story stick upright in the bracket they used to hold the puppet crossbars. [374] Then he began to letter something on the long strip of butcher paper they used for backdrops. [389]

His brush moved with the fluidity that had made his name, but the words he wrote were not decorative. [407] They were the verbatim accusations Jin had hurled at him, rendered in gorgeous, trembling script. [421] Below them, he wrote Dara's defense. [427] Below that, his own silence, represented by an empty line so perfectly ruled it looked like a held breath. [445]

When he finished, he called the others back. [453]

They came warily. [456] Jin's arms were crossed. [460] Dara looked like she had been crying, though she would deny it. [472] The two younger puppeteers, Sasha and Reem, hovered near the entrance. [483]

Marcus did not pick up the story stick. [490] Instead, he gestured to it, mounted on the stage, and to the calligraphed transcript hanging behind it. [507]

"I want to reverse this," he said quietly. [515] "Tonight, when we perform at The Silt, I don't want to tell their stories. I want to give them the stick." [537]

Jin frowned. [539] "You want the audience to run the show?" [547]

"I want to reverse who holds the authority. We letter their words live, on the backdrop. The puppets act out what they tell us. We become their instruments." [574]

The dome held the silence the way it had once held radar signals -- receiving, parsing, turning invisible waves into meaning. [593]

Dara picked up a puppet, one of the harbor-worker figures with its chipped paint and weighted hands. [609] She looked at it for a long time. [616] "It might be terrible," she said. [622]

"It might," Marcus agreed. [626] He felt the serenity still, not as the absence of conflict but as its digestion, the way the dome had swallowed decades of electromagnetic noise and now stood open to the moon. [657] "But the story won't be ours to judge. That's the point." [668]

Jin uncrossed his arms. [672] He reached for the brush pen. [678]

Outside, the harbor stretched dark and endless, and somewhere above the cloud cover, debris from ancient collisions streaked silently toward earth, burning into nothing before they arrived, illuminating for one half-second the shapes of things already there. [714]

They packed the puppets. [718] They rolled the butcher paper. [723] Marcus slid the story stick into his coat like a conductor's baton, though tonight he intended to hand it away. [742]

The van started. [745] The dome stood empty, still collecting signals from a sky that had long since moved on to different frequencies. [763]
