The workshop had no roof, which was precisely why Maren had chosen it. [13]

Timber walls rose like the ribs of some gentle beast, open to the sky where constellations pulsed in their ancient arrangements, and shadows pooled in the corners where her instruments gathered dust and purpose in equal measure. [49] She called it a workshop, though others might have called it a sanctuary, a laboratory, or a beautiful mess. [66] Transistor radios sat beside singing bowls. [72] A harpsichord missing half its keys leaned against a shelf of tuning forks arranged by pitch. [87] Maren herself was an eclectic pacifist, a woman who had refused every war the world offered her--wars of opinion, wars of volume, wars of ego--and had instead dedicated her life to listening. [115]

Tonight was the final stillness before fireworks ignite. [123] The town below her hillside workshop was holding its breath, thousands of people gathered along the river with their faces tilted upward, waiting for the first explosion of color. [149] But Maren was not interested in the explosion. [157] She was interested in what came just before it: that singular, unrepeatable hush when an entire population falls silent at once. [175]

She had spent eleven years trying to catalog the varieties of silence. [186] Not metaphorically. [188] Literally. [189] She had notebooks filled with intuitively descriptive entries--the silence of a hospital corridor at three a.m. rendered as "pressed cotton, faintly copper-tasting." [209] The silence after a child's question about death: "a held breath wearing formal clothes." [223] The silence of snowfall on an empty parking lot: "white static, the universe adjusting its antenna." [237]

But there was one silence she had never managed to capture, and it haunted her like an unfinished chord. [254] It was the silence her mother had kept. [261]

On the workbench before her sat a leather diary with a locked diary clasp, tarnished green with age. [278] Her mother's diary. [281] Maren had carried it for six years without opening it, not because she lacked the key--she had found it taped inside a teacup--but because she feared what frequency of silence she might find within. [314] Her mother had been a woman of tremendous interior weather who shared almost none of it, and Maren had spent a lifetime interpreting that quiet as rejection. [340]

Tonight, though, she meant to recover what had been lost between them. [351]

She lifted a tuning fork--440 hertz, concert pitch, the note orchestras use to find agreement with one another--and struck it against her palm. [374] The tone floated upward through the open roof and into the stars. [385] This was her method: by tuning frequencies, she could calibrate her own listening, peel back the layers of ambient noise until she reached the silence underneath. [409] She struck another fork, then another, building a scaffold of pure tones around herself, each one dissolving into the next like a prayer dissolving into understanding. [436]

The town below grew impossibly still. [442] She felt it in her sternum, that collective pause, and she let it tune her too. [457]

Then she turned the key in the locked clasp. [466]

The diary opened with a sound like a small gasp. [476] Inside, her mother's handwriting was cramped and urgent, nothing like the composed woman Maren remembered. [491] The entries were not events but observations--descriptions of Maren herself as a child. [504] "She holds dandelions like they are important dignitaries." [512] "She told me the rain sounds lonely today and I wanted to weep because she is right." [528] "I do not know how to say what I feel so I am writing it here where it is safe." [546]

Page after page, her mother had been listening too. [555] Listening to Maren. [558] Cataloging her own daughter the way Maren now cataloged silence--with desperate, aching attention that had no idea how to become speech. [578]

Maren closed her eyes. [582] The path to empathy, she understood now, was not paved with words spoken aloud. [595] Sometimes it ran through years of quiet, through locked clasps and unroofed workshops and the patient work of tuning oneself to a frequency that someone else had been broadcasting all along. [625]

A single rocket whistled upward from the riverbank. [633] In the half-second before it burst, Maren held the diary to her chest and listened to the last silence she would ever need to catalog. [657] She wrote it down later in her notebook, in handwriting that shook: "The silence of being loved without knowing it. [676] Warm. [677] Warm like a hand almost touching yours in the dark." [686]

Then the sky broke open in light and sound, and Maren let herself weep with theatrical sincerity, grandly, generously, the way fireworks weep--scattering brightness in every direction, holding nothing back. [717]
