She hung suspended above the glowing viaduct, her body refusing the earth's oldest law, and watched the rain's last drops fall toward puddles that had not yet decided to ripple. [32]

Maren had always defied gravity. [37] Not through willpower or device, but through some fracture in her relationship with the world — as though the universe had forgotten to finish writing the rules that applied to her. [62] She floated three feet above the wet stone of the viaduct, its arches luminous with bioluminescent moss that the storm had awakened, each surface throwing pale green light upward into the saturated dark. [91] The brightness was eerie, beautiful, and somehow threatening, as though the glow itself was a countdown. [106]

In her hands she held the ancient clay tablet with runes that she'd pulled from the labyrinth's seventh chamber, the one that kept regenerating its corridors through procedural generation, never the same path twice. [137] The runes were not words. [142] They were timestamps. [145]

She had spent what felt like centuries — and may have been centuries, given that she was periodically eternal, dying and resurrecting at intervals she could neither predict nor control — trying to conquer the labyrinth of self. [177] That was what the monks at the viaduct's eastern terminus called it. [189] The labyrinth that grew beneath the bridge was not made of stone but of fractured timelines, each corridor a version of a choice she had made or refused, branching and recombining in patterns that no human memory could hold. [224] The procedural generation meant it learned from her. [232] Every time she entered, it rebuilt itself from her hesitations, her fears, the moments she looked away. [247]

Tonight she needed to retrace. [252]

The tablet told her how. [257] Its runes, when pressed in sequence, didn't open doors — they collapsed timelines, folding the fractured paths back into a single corridor that she could walk without splitting into the thousand selves the labyrinth demanded. [290] But the window for activation was impossibly narrow: between the drop and the ripple. [303] That quantum instant when rain strikes water and the surface hasn't yet responded. [315] A moment that existed outside of time's agreement with itself. [325]

Maren watched the last drop descend. [331] She had been counting them since the storm broke, floating here for hours, cataloging each one, waiting for the final drop — the one the moss-light would illuminate perfectly, the one whose puddle sat directly above the labyrinth's current entrance. [367]

She pressed the first rune. [372] The clay warmed. [375] Below her, the drop touched the water's skin. [384]

She pressed the second rune and felt the fractured timelines shudder, a thousand versions of herself gasping in corridors that suddenly had no walls. [405] The brightness of the viaduct intensified, green light climbing the arches like fire climbing curtains, gorgeous and alarming. [421] Darkening brightness — that was what the monks called it. [431] The closer you got to understanding, the more the light blinded. [442]

Third rune. [444] Fourth. [445] Fifth. [446]

The ripple had not yet formed. [452] She was still inside the moment. [459]

Sixth rune, and the labyrinth screamed. [465] She felt it in her hovering bones, every corridor she had ever walked trying to exist simultaneously, every version of herself she'd met in those mirrored halls — the coward, the tyrant, the child who first floated off the ground and thought she was broken. [502] They were converging. [505] The procedural generation was running in reverse now, un-building, un-branching, retracing every path back to a single origin. [521]

Seventh rune. [523]

The ripple began. [526]

But Maren was already falling — not downward, never downward, but inward, through the collapsed corridor that now ran like a vein of light from the puddle's surface to the labyrinth's heart. [556] She saw her selves fold into her like wings closing. [566] The coward gave her caution. [571] The tyrant gave her will. [577] The child gave her the memory of first flight, that terrified joy. [589]

She landed — impossibly, for the first time in her life, she landed — on solid ground at the labyrinth's center. [607] Gravity held her. [610] The moss-light dimmed to something honest, something merely beautiful. [619] The tablet crumbled to dust in her hands, its purpose spent. [630]

Above her, through stone and water and time, the ripple finally completed its circle and went still. [646]

Maren stood in the dark, whole, grounded, afraid of nothing. [656] The labyrinth had no more corridors to offer. [665] She had conquered it not by solving it but by collapsing the distance between who she was and who she had been. [685]

She climbed the stairs toward the viaduct's fading glow, each step heavy, each step hers. [700]

The eternity that had carried her would come again — she knew this, felt it waiting like weather on the horizon. [719] But for now, between the last ripple and whatever came next, Maren walked. [732]

Gravity held. [734]

The brightness darkened to dawn. [739]
