The terrace drifted. [3] That was the first thing Maren understood about it — not that it hung suspended in light, not that its glass railings fractured the sky into moving spectra, but that it moved, slowly, like something untethered from a world that had stopped asking it to stay. [44]

She had been the corn maze architect's lost child. [53] Not lost in the way people lose keys or forget appointments, but lost the way a river loses a tributary — through distance, through the slow divergence of channels that once shared the same source. [82] Her father, Elias Volk, had spent thirty years designing labyrinths in cornfields across the Midwest, and somewhere in that devotion to turning people around, he had turned away from her. [111]

She sat at the wooden table on the prism terrace and opened the pilot logbook she had found in his workshop after the funeral. [133] The pages were dense with weather codes — METAR abbreviations, visibility readings, cloud ceiling notations — all in his handwriting, though he had never been a pilot. [157] She had not known this about him. [164] She had not known most things about him. [172]

The fractured hush of this place suited her. [180] Light split and reformed around her. [186] Silence came in pieces. [190]

She ran her fingers along the table's surface, tracing the grain the way she had done since childhood — reading wood the way others read palms. [212] She could intuit things this way: the age of a tree by the tightness of its rings, the season of its felling by the density near the bark. [238] Her father had taught her this, one of the few lessons that survived the necessary distances between them. [253] Analyzing the grain in wooden furniture was her inheritance, the one fluency they shared. [265]

The table beneath the logbook was old oak, tight-grained, patient. [275] It told her: slow growth, steady conditions, a life without upheaval. [285] Nothing like theirs. [288]

She turned to the weather codes again. [295] He had logged conditions for dates she recognized — her birthdays, her graduations, the day she left for college and did not call for three years. [319] Each entry was clinical: SKC for sky clear, OVC for overcast, FG for fog. [333] But the pattern, when she laid the entries side by side, formed something else. [346] He had been recording the weather on every day that mattered to her, as if from a great altitude, watching her life from a cockpit he never occupied. [373]

This was what had happened after the butterfly effect — after the single argument at dinner when she was sixteen, the one about nothing, about cornfields and wasted talent and whether designing mazes was art or avoidance. [407] That small turbulence had cascaded. [413] She left. [416] He stayed. [419] The channels diverged. [422]

Now she sat on a terrace that drifted through prismatic light, and she understood that she had come here to discover why some thresholds feel sacred. [446] The doorway of his workshop. [451] The entrance to every maze he built. [458] The front door of the house she grew up in, which she had crossed for the last time without knowing it was the last time. [480] Thresholds were not just openings. [486] They were distances compressed into a single step — the whole length of a separation, folded into a frame you could stand inside for one trembling moment. [510]

She was featherly determined now — not fierce, not desperate, but persistent the way down clings to skin, the way a single filament holds to the air long after the bird has passed. [542] She would not rage against what was lost. [550] She would trace it, the way she traced grain, until the pattern made sense. [563]

The last entry in the logbook was dated the morning he died. [574] The code read: CAVOK. [579] Ceiling and visibility OK. [583] No clouds. [586] No obstructions. [589] A perfect day for seeing far. [595]

She closed the book. [599] The terrace drifted. [602] The light broke and reformed, and in every spectrum she saw the architecture of distance — how it could be a maze, how it could be a sky, how the space between two people might be the most carefully designed thing either of them ever built. [641]

She pressed her palm flat against the oak grain one last time and intuited what he had been trying to say with all those weather codes, all those silent observations from the necessary distance he could not close. [675]

I was watching. [678] The sky was clear. [683] I could see you. [689]
