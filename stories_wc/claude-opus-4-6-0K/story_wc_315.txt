She sat in the crook of the great arbor, legs dangling over nothing, and waited for the static to die. [20]

The trees here grew so high that their canopies breached the cloud layer, and at midnight the world above was a cathedral of branches and stars, the fog floor shifting below like a silver sea. [52] Maren had climbed to this perch every night for eleven years, listening to the radio frequencies that threaded through the upper atmosphere, cataloging the patterns that nobody else could hear. [80] She was a midnight pattern seeker, and the arbor was her observatory. [92]

Tonight the static had lasted longer than usual, a full forty minutes of white noise hissing through her headset like breath trapped in a seashell. [115] She used the time to revise her logbook, scratching corrections into entries from the previous week, adjusting timestamps and frequency signatures with the attentively inventive shorthand she had developed over a decade of solitary work. [148] Each symbol was a compression of meaning, a tiny architecture of lines that encoded not just data but context, emotion, the texture of what she had heard. [175]

Then the static cleared, and there was silence, and in the silence there was a voice. [191]

"Maren. [192] Are you receiving." [195]

It was not a question. [200] It was Tomas, and the flatness in his tone told her everything she needed to know. [216] The drop had gone wrong. [221]

She pressed the transmit key. [226] "I'm here. [228] Go ahead." [230]

"Harness failure on exit. [234] Secondary chute deployed but the main canopy is tangled in the rigging. [245] I'm descending faster than planned. [250] I need you to talk me through the manual release." [260]

Maren closed her eyes. [264] This was the watcher's burden: to sit in the cathedral of branches and stars, to hear everything, to see nothing, and to carry the weight of someone else's survival on nothing but her voice. [296] She could not reach down through the clouds and steady his hands. [308] She could only speak clearly and hope that clarity was enough. [319]

"Tomas, listen to me. [323] The manual release is on your left chest strap. [332] You've practiced this. [335] Don't think about it, just let your hands remember." [344]

She heard his breathing, ragged and fast, and beneath it the whistle of wind through nylon. [359] Remembering through muscle memory was the only way to manage fear at terminal velocity. [373] The conscious mind would seize, would second-guess, would hesitate at precisely the moment hesitation could kill. [387] But the body knew. [391] The body had rehearsed. [395]

"I can't find it," he said. [401]

"You can. [403] Left hand across your chest. [408] The parachute buckle is recessed, half an inch below the sternum clip. [420] You've released it two hundred times in training. [429] Your thumb knows the shape." [434]

Silence. [435] A soundless echo of all the trust they had built over years of these midnight operations, every promise kept, every signal answered. [454] She had to preserve that trust now, under pressure, because if her voice wavered he would feel it and the doubt would spread to his fingers. [479]

"Got it," he whispered. [483]

"Turn it clockwise, then pull straight out. [490] Don't jerk. [492] Smooth." [493]

She heard the click through the radio, distant and metallic, like a lock turning in a room she could not enter. [512] Then a gasp, and the sound of fabric catching air, and the whistle softened to a hum. [529]

"Canopy deployed. [531] Full spread. [533] I'm slowing." [535]

Maren exhaled and opened her eyes. [541] The stars were still there. [547] The branches still held. [551] Below, the clouds moved like the surface of a dream, and somewhere beneath them Tomas was drifting toward the earth with a good chute above him and the memory of her voice in his ear. [586]

She picked up her logbook and began to revise the night's entry, adding the new symbols she would need: one for harness failure, one for manual release, one for the specific quality of silence that exists between two people when one of them is falling and the other is sitting in a tree above the clouds, holding steady. [641]

The radio hissed softly, then went quiet. [648] She kept her headset on. [653] She always did. [657] The watcher's burden was not something you set down; it was something you carried into every silence, every frequency, every long midnight in the arbor, because someone below the clouds was always trusting you to listen. [696]

And listening was the one thing she would never fail to do. [708]
