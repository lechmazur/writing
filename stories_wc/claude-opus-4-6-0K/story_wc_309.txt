The spire rose above the cloud line like a finger of frozen argument, its walls sheeted in ice so old it had forgotten being water. [27] Cael sat on the observation ledge with his legs dangling over nothing, watching the mist below churn in slow, luminous spirals that never quite went dark. [52] That was the thing about this altitude: light didn't behave. [62] It lingered. [64] Sunset had ended hours ago, yet a dim radiance clung to every crystal surface, as though the photons had nowhere else to go and had simply decided to stay. [91]

He was, by every measure the Consortium kept, an underachieving mage. [102] His quarterly output scores ranked him in the lowest percentile. [112] This had not always mattered, but it mattered now, in the age when creativity itself had been automated -- when the Loom engines in the lowland cities could weave spells from raw intention faster and more reliably than any human practitioner. [147] The Consortium didn't need mages who fumbled. [155] They needed mages who outperformed machines, or they needed no mages at all. [167]

Cael reached behind his back and began to unstrap the harness that held the keystone against his spine. [183] The leather was stiff from the cold, and his fingers were clumsy, but eventually the stone came free and he cradled it in both hands. [207] It was a garden folly keystone, carved a century ago for the decorative arch in some nobleman's pleasure garden -- not a weapon, not a focus crystal, not anything the Consortium would catalog as significant. [240] It was simple limestone shaped like a blunt wedge, and somebody had chiseled a little vine pattern along its edges. [258] He'd found it in a rubble pile during a salvage assignment and kept it for no reason he could articulate. [276]

The keystone glowed faintly in his palms, borrowing the lingering luminance that saturated the spire. [290] Or maybe contributing to it. [295] He couldn't tell anymore. [299]

His mentor, before she'd been decommissioned, had told him the icebound spire accommodates impossibilities. [312] She'd said it exactly that way, as though the architecture had volition. [323] Things that couldn't coexist elsewhere found room here: warmth inside ice, silence inside wind, meaning inside a decorative stone that should have meant nothing. [345]

Cael closed his eyes and pressed the keystone to his chest. [356] He didn't speak an incantation. [361] The Loom engines had made incantations obsolete anyway -- they could parse intent and render it into effect with algorithmic perfection. [378] What they couldn't do, what no machine had ever done, was mist walk. [390]

Mist walking wasn't a spell. [395] It was a surrender. [399] You let the mist below the spire rise into you, let its diffuse, directionless light replace the hard architecture of your thoughts, and then you moved without moving. [427] The Consortium had tried to automate it and produced only fog. [438] Because mist walking required something the Loom engines couldn't simulate: the willingness to find the sacred in the simple, to treat a carved limestone wedge as though it were the axis of the world and mean it. [472]

Cael stepped off the ledge. [477]

He did not fall. [481] The mist received him the way a cathedral receives a whisper -- not by amplifying it but by giving it room to exist. [502] He drifted through the brilliant dimness, that paradox of radiance and shadow that had no name in any optics textbook, and the keystone pulsed against his ribs like a second heart. [533]

Below him, through gaps in the cloud, he could see the Loom cities glittering with automated precision, every spell perfect, every enchantment optimized, every scrap of wonder processed into product. [562] They were magnificent and they were empty, and he understood now why his mentor had sent him here before they retired her. [581]

The sacred was not in the grand. [588] It was in the vine pattern some anonymous mason had carved on a stone that would sit atop a decorative arch in a garden nobody important would visit. [614] It was in the act of carrying that stone up an impossible spire and stepping into mist with it held against your heart. [637] It was in the lingering luminance that refused to fade because something -- someone -- still believed light was worth attending to. [655]

Cael drifted higher. [658] The mist thinned and the stars appeared, hard and ancient, and the keystone in his arms shone brighter than any of them. [679] Not with power. [682] With attention. [684] With the simple, stubborn, sacred act of noticing. [692]

Somewhere below, a Loom engine calculated that mist walking was statistically irrelevant. [703] Somewhere above, an underachieving mage proved it wrong by doing nothing more extraordinary than caring about a stone. [720]

The light lingered. [723] It always would, as long as someone was willing to linger with it. [736]
