Maren had been hired to scream, and she was extraordinary at it. [12] For seven years she'd worked as a crisis actor, performing in emergency drills, collapsing on cue in shopping malls and subway stations so that first responders could practice saving someone who didn't need saving. [46] The irony was a stone in her shoe: she had survived the Kellerman Avenue collapse at nineteen, pulled from rubble after eleven hours with dust cemented into her lungs and a fracture running through her left wrist like a river delta. [87] She knew what real crisis felt like. [93] That knowledge made her performance convincing, and that was what made every performance a small betrayal. [109]

Now the capital was between governments, an interregnum that stretched like a held breath. [123] The old premier had fled. [128] The new parliament hadn't yet convened. [134] In the vacuum, the whispering gallery beneath the former Palace of Assembly had been left unlocked, unguarded, open to anyone who wandered in from the rain. [160] Maren wandered in from the rain. [166]

The gallery was a vast elliptical corridor, its domed ceiling designed so that a whisper spoken at one focal point could be heard perfectly at the other, forty meters away. [196] During the old regime, diplomats had used it for deniable conversations. [207] Now it was empty, and the emptiness had a quality she could only describe as luminous, as though the absence of all those conspiring voices had left behind a faint, residual glow. [239]

On a stone bench at the gallery's midpoint sat a chessboard. [250] Someone had left it there, perhaps one of the palace guards in those final chaotic days. [266] Every pawn was missing. [270] Only the major pieces remained: kings, queens, bishops, rooks, knights, the powerful and the specialized, stranded without their front line. [290] Maren ran her finger along the board's edge. [298] It felt like a portrait of the country. [306]

She had come here with a purpose she was still learning to articulate. [319] For years, her crisis work had taught her that history remembered only the spectacular, the explosion, the collapse, the moment of impact. [341] But she had survived Kellerman Avenue because a stranger's hand found hers in the dark. [356] Because someone had hummed a melody to keep her conscious. [366] These were the gestures no one recorded, and she wanted to become their historian. [380]

She began to walk. [384]

The whispering gallery's acoustics meant that footsteps, like voices, carried with supernatural clarity. [397] Maren had discovered, months ago in an abandoned rotunda, that by varying her path, curving left, stepping right, pausing, reversing, she could trace letters across a floor in a pattern of walking that spelled words. [432] She had mapped the alphabet onto movements. [439] It was part choreography, part cartography, part prayer. [447] Today she walked the names of people who had performed small, uncelebrated acts of mercy during the Kellerman collapse: the hand-holder, the hummer, the woman who tore her coat into tourniquets without being asked. [481]

Her footsteps whispered their names across the dome and back. [491]

This was what it meant to unbind herself, not just from the crisis actor's role, from the performance of suffering, but from the idea that survival was something to be rehearsed. [522] She was cutting the cords between herself and every staged collapse, every choreographed scream. [536] She was benevolently ruthless about it, gentle with herself but merciless toward the fiction that had sustained her for seven years. [557] She would not pretend anymore. [562] She would only remember. [566]

The interregnum outside continued. [570] Governments would form and dissolve. [575] But here in the gallery, Maren moved through her nomadic penumbra, that wandering edge between light and shadow, between the self who had performed crisis and the self who had survived it. [607] She was neither fully illuminated nor fully dark. [615] She drifted through the borderland, and the borderland drifted with her, and she understood that this was not a limitation but a language. [638]

The chessboard watched from its bench, all those absent pawns like all those unrecorded kindnesses, the small essential presences without which no game could be played, no history could be true. [669]

Maren paused at the gallery's focal point. [676] She whispered a name. [680] It traveled the full length of the dome and returned to her, unchanged, as though the building itself had decided to remember. [702] She kept walking. [705] She kept spelling. [708] The gallery kept whispering back. [713]
