The mountain had been hollowed long before anyone could remember, its granite chambers carved into aisles and alcoves, its natural fissures widened into corridors that spiraled downward through geological strata, each level holding older and more dangerous volumes. [43] They called it the Athenaeum, though no one recalled who had named it. [55] Maren had worked its deepest floors for eleven years, shelving texts no one requested, cataloging languages no one spoke. [71]

She was a mercury-glass seer, her eyes carrying that telltale silver sheen that marked those born with the gift of reading futures in reflective surfaces. [95] But she hadn't used that gift in years. [103] She had buried it deliberately, the way one buries a key beneath a hearthstone — not to lose it, but to ensure it could never unlock anything again. [130]

After remembering becomes painful, you learn to build walls. [139] Maren had seen her mother's death three years before it happened, reflected in a rain puddle on an autumn street, and the long unspooling of that foreknowledge had hollowed her as thoroughly as the mountain had been hollowed. [170] She could not unsee it. [174] So she stopped looking. [178]

Every night, she substituted reality with something gentler. [186] She would descend to the forty-third level, where the air tasted of iron and old paper, and she would read aloud from books written in scripts she couldn't decipher, letting the alien syllables replace the architecture of her waking mind. [219] The words meant nothing, and that was the mercy. [228] They seeded strange dreams — forests with grammar for roots, oceans conjugating themselves against basalt shores — and she would wake having forgotten, briefly, the shape of what she'd lost. [254]

It was on one of these nights that she found the stone. [266]

It sat on a shelf between two water-damaged folios on the sixty-first level, a place she had never cataloged because the stairs there were partly collapsed. [292] The stone was smooth, dark, covered in raised glyphs that caught her fingertips like Braille. [306] She recognized nothing about the language, but the texture — the texture was familiar. [318] It felt exactly like running her thumb along the barb of a feather, that directional grain, smooth one way and resistant the other. [338]

She turned it over. [342] The glyphs on the reverse side were different, denser, and when she traced them, something shifted behind her silver eyes. [360] Not a vision. [363] A memory. [365]

Home. [366]

Not her apartment in the mountain's residential quarter. [374] Not her mother's house with its rain puddle and its terrible autumn. [385] Something older, something she had never consciously known: a place with low ceilings and warm stone, voices speaking in a cadence that matched the rhythm of the glyphs beneath her fingers. [412]

The lost language stone, the senior archivist later told her, was one of seven. [425] Each encoded a dead tongue from before the mountain was carved, from the civilization that had first hollowed these corridors not for books but for habitation. [449] For home. [451]

Maren understood then what her buried talent had been trying to show her all along. [465] The mercury-glass sight didn't only reach forward into futures. [474] It reached into the deep structure of things, reading the grain of time the way a finger reads the texture of a feather — smooth in one direction, barbed in the other. [502] She had been so afraid of what lay ahead that she'd never thought to look behind. [517]

She began translating the stone. [522] It took months. [525] She worked by lamplight on the sixty-first level, cross-referencing fragments from a hundred shelved volumes, and the language came alive under her hands like a seed germinating in darkness. [551] Each glyph she decoded seeded another connection, another corridor of meaning that branched and spiraled like the mountain itself. [568]

The texts described a people who understood home not as a place but as a shape — a pattern of relationships between light, stone, breath, and belonging. [592] They had built the mountain around that pattern. [600] Every passage, every turning staircase, every chamber was a syllable in an architectural sentence that said: you are not lost. [617]

Maren set down the stone and looked at her reflection in its polished surface. [631] Her silver eyes flared. [635] She did not look away. [640]

The vision that came was not of death or disaster. [650] It was of the sixty-first level filled with light, and herself standing in it, speaking the old language to others who had come to learn. [674] The hidden thunder in her chest — the thing she had mistaken for dread all these years — was not warning. [693] It was resonance. [696]

She had been living inside the shape of home her entire life and had been too afraid to read its walls. [716]

Now, finally, she could. [720]
