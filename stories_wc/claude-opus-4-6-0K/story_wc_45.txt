Maren had always been the kind of woman who doubted miracles but forgave those who believed in them. [18] As the village bone-setter, she dealt in certainties: the precise angle of a fractured radius, the firm pressure needed to coax a dislocated shoulder home. [43] She trusted what she could feel beneath her hands. [52] But after the substitute body was found in the Harrow cradle--a bundle of alder wood and river clay shaped uncannily like an infant--even Maren felt the ground shift beneath what she knew. [86]

The mother, Elise Harrow, had not stopped weeping in three days. [97] The father had taken an axe to the wooden thing and wept when splinters scattered like bones across the floor. [117] The village whispered the old word: changeling. [124] Maren whispered nothing, but she listened. [130]

It was old Britta who told her about the garden. [140] "Behind the Thornfield hedge maze," the woman said, her milky eyes shrewd beneath a performance of senility that Maren had long recognized. [162] Britta was shrewdly innocent that way--she played the fool so convincingly that people confessed their strangest truths to her, and she collected them like pressed flowers. [189] "That's where the fair folk keep what they take. [198] That's where you'll find the real child, if there's a real child left to find." [213]

"You believe that," Maren said. [218] It was not a question and not an accusation. [227]

"I believe you'll go," Britta answered. [233]

She was right. [236] Maren went because she yearned--not for proof of fairies, but for something she couldn't name. [252] A restoration. [254] She had lost her own daughter to fever six winters past, and she had always believed that if her hands had been steadier, if she had known some better method, the girl might have lived. [289] Since then, Maren had carried her mistakes like fractured bones that never properly set, and she wanted--desperately, quietly--to turn those mistakes into something she could navigate by. [318] Into constellations. [320]

The hedge maze behind Thornfield Manor had grown wild since the family abandoned the estate a generation ago. [338] Maren pressed through corridors of hawthorn and blackberry, thorns catching her sleeves like small hands. [353] The passage took an hour of wrong turns before the hedges opened suddenly into a clearing she had no rational reason to believe existed. [377]

The secret garden was impossible. [382] That was the first cleft in her certainty. [390] Roses bloomed in November. [394] A stone basin reflected stars, though it was midday. [403] Apple trees stood heavy with fruit that smelled of honey and chalk. [415] In the center grew an oak whose roots surfaced and dove like the backs of sea creatures, and nestled in a hollow between two roots, wrapped in spider silk and clover, lay a small white tooth. [451]

A baby tooth. [454] Maren picked it up and felt it the way she felt bones--reading its truth through her fingertips. [472] It was human. [475] Almost. [476] There was something in its texture, a faint wrongness, like a word misspelled so subtly you had to read the sentence twice. [498] A changeling's tooth, shed in the passage between one world and another. [510]

She closed her hand around it and understood, for the first time, that certainty was not a wall but a living thing, and living things could fracture. [537] She understood, too, that fractures could be set. [545] That was her craft, after all--bone setting, the patient art of aligning what had broken so it could heal stronger along the seam. [569]

She had come looking for the Harrow child, but what she found instead was permission. [584] Permission to hold the tooth of something impossible and not demand that it explain itself. [599] Permission to forgive herself for the fever, for the small hands she couldn't warm, for the constellation she had refused to see because she insisted on staring at the dark spaces between the stars. [633]

Maren placed the tooth in her pocket and began the work of finding the child. [648] She did not know if the garden would yield the infant, or if the fair folk were real, or if she was merely a grief-maddened woman kneeling in a ruin. [678] But she knew the feel of something broken that wanted to be whole. [691] She had built her life around that knowledge. [699]

The roses turned their faces toward her as if remembering some older sun. [712] Maren set her hands against the oak's bark, closed her eyes, and listened for the crying she was almost certain she could hear beneath the roots--a sound caught halfway between this world and some luminous, unverifiable other. [750]

She chose to believe it. [755] Not because she was no longer a skeptic, but because some fractures ask to be set with faith, and she had always been in the business of mending what others declared beyond repair. [788]
