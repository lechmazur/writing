The projection booth of the Orpheum Palace smelled of cellulose and dust, a cathedral for images no one came to worship anymore. Maren had climbed the narrow staircase in darkness, her fingers trailing the banister's chipped paint, following the pull that had drawn her here for three nights running. [49]

She was a crystal gazer by trade, though she hated the carnival sound of it. What she actually did was subtler: she held objects and listened to what they remembered. Psychometry, the textbooks called it. She called it eavesdropping on the dead. [90]

Tonight the booth waited for her like a confessional. The twin projectors stood sentinel, their lenses clouded with cataracts of grime. Reels hung on hooks along the wall, and a workbench held scattered tools, a logbook, and a stack of goodbye letters bound with a rubber band so old it crumbled when she touched it. [141]

The letters were why she'd come. [147]

Maren had found the first one in a thrift shop, tucked inside a coat pocket. It was written in a hand both precise and desperate, addressed to someone called "My Undeveloped Darling." The writer, a woman named Estelle, described love she had never spoken aloud, love she had instead poured into the films she projected night after night in this booth, splicing her longing into the leader strips between reels so that it flickered on the screen for a fraction of a second, invisible to anyone not searching for it. [229]

To find where unused love is stored. That was the phrase Estelle used, and it had landed in Maren's chest like a key turning a lock she hadn't known existed. [258]

Now Maren lifted the stack of letters and closed her eyes. The psychometry reading began not as vision but as vibration, a low hum beneath her sternum, hushed thunder rolling through a body of bone and breath. She felt Estelle's hands, calloused from threading film, felt the booth's heat in summer when the carbon arc lamps turned the room into a furnace, felt the ache of watching love stories unspool for audiences who would leave holding someone else's hand. [326]

Maren set the letters down and reached for what the reading was pointing her toward: a single film strip coiled in a rusted canister on the top shelf. The label read UNSENT. She unspooled a length of it and held it to the booth's bare bulb. Frame by frame, she saw not a movie but a message. Estelle had photographed her goodbye letters, each page a frame, and between them she had spliced images of empty theater seats, of hands almost touching, of a mouth shaping words that had no sound. [407]

Maren was spatially imaginative in ways that unnerved people. She could hold a building's blueprint in her mind and walk its halls without moving. Now she let the film strip's geography unfold inside her, room after room of Estelle's loneliness arranged like a house she could finally enter. She saw the booth not as it was but as Estelle had experienced it: a nest, a womb, a place to incubate feelings too fragile for open air. [476]

Estelle had stored her unused love here, in chemistry and light, in silver halide crystals that held shadow the way a jar holds fireflies. The goodbye letters were not farewells to a person. They were farewells to the silence, each one a declaration that the love existed even if it was never received. [527]

Maren threaded the film strip into the old projector. The machine protested, then relented, clattering to life with a sound like a mechanical heartbeat. Light punched through the booth's small window and struck the screen in the empty theater below. The letters appeared, enormous and trembling, while forgotten lyrics searched for their tune in the projector's rhythmic clatter, a melody of sprocket holes and shutter blades that had waited decades for someone to press play. [601]

She watched every frame. When the film ran out and the screen went white, Maren stood in the silence that follows thunder. She understood now that love unexpressed does not vanish. It migrates. It lodges in the walls of projection booths and the pockets of thrift-store coats and the hands of strangers who know how to listen to objects. [659]

She rewound the film carefully, placed it back in its canister, and added her own letter to the stack. It said only: I found it. It is safe. It was always safe. [695]

Then she descended the staircase into the dark theater, where the screen still glowed faintly, a ghost of light that refused to fully disappear. [718]
