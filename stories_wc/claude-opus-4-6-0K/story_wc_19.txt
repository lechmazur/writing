The trellis grew above the clouds, woven from living wood and threaded with vines that bore no fruit, only hospitality. [22] Every wanderer who climbed high enough found a place to rest among its latticed platforms, suspended in white mist and thin air, where the sky offered itself like an open hand. [51] They called it the Xenial Trellis, and it had welcomed travelers for centuries without asking anything in return. [67]

Maren had never wanted to come here. [74] She was the daughter of Elric Voss, the most celebrated bunker builder in the lowlands, a man who had spent his life carving sanctuaries deep into rock. [98] He had raised her underground, in rooms with ceilings so low she could press both palms flat against them. [116] By the time she was seven, her lungs would seize at the sight of a closed door. [132] By twelve, she understood that her father's gift for containment had planted its opposite in her -- a claustrophobia so severe that even sleep felt like burial. [157]

She carried a tiny porcelain doll in her coat pocket, the only thing her mother had left behind before vanishing into one of Elric's deeper projects. [180] The doll's face was worn smooth from Maren's thumb, its painted smile almost gone. [193] She spoke to it sometimes, not because she believed it could hear, but because the silence that followed her words had a particular flavor -- intimate, close, like a breath returned. [222]

That was what had brought her to the trellis: the silences. [233] Maren had discovered, sometime in her fifteenth year, that silence was not one thing. [246] It came in varieties as distinct as wine. [254] The silence of a bunker was dense, metallic, pressing inward. [263] The silence of a field was thin and restless. [272] The silence of a cathedral held its own echo like a secret. [283] She wanted to collect them all, to hold every shade of quiet inside herself until she understood what her mother had been listening for when she chose to descend and never return. [312]

The silence above the clouds was different from any she had known. [324] It was gilded -- a gilded hush, luminous and heavy at once, as though the air had been leafed in gold that you could not see but somehow felt against the skin. [353] Intangibly tangible, it pressed without weight, touched without texture. [361] Maren stood on the highest platform of the trellis and let it fill her, breathing slowly, limiting her exposure the way she had learned to manage every overwhelming space: small sips, not gulps. [391]

By limiting exposure, she could stay. [397] She could keep her lungs from clenching, her vision from tunneling. [407] She counted seconds, then allowed herself ten more, then ten more, stretching each contracted moment like taffy pulled between careful hands. [425]

Then gravity inverted. [428]

It happened without warning, as it did once each month above the clouds -- a phenomenon the trellis had been built to survive. [449] The vines gripped the lattice. [454] The platforms held. [457] But Maren's feet lifted from the wood, and she rose, coat billowing downward -- or was it upward now? [474] She clutched the railing and felt the porcelain doll shift in her pocket, pressing against her ribs as if trying to escape toward the sky below. [498]

For one hour, the world inverted. [504] Maren hung above an infinite ceiling of cloud, and the silence changed. [516] The gilded hush deepened into something she had no name for -- a silence that sprouted, that grew like a vine from the stillness itself, branching and leafing and reaching into her chest where the old terror coiled. [549]

She let it sprout. [553] She breathed. [555] The claustrophobia was there, familiar as her own heartbeat, but the openness around her was so vast that the fear had nowhere to build its walls. [578] She was contained by nothing. [583] For the first time, the absence of enclosure did not panic her; it cradled her. [596]

When gravity returned and her boots found the platform again, Maren pulled the porcelain doll from her pocket and held it to the light. [619] The worn face caught the gold of the upper atmosphere. [629] She whispered to it, and the silence that followed was new -- neither her mother's silence nor her father's, but her own. [650]

She added it to her collection: the silence of a woman no longer afraid of open doors. [666] Then she began the long climb down, carrying every flavor of quiet she had gathered, descending toward the world that still needed its bunkers, its walls, its buried rooms -- but would never again bury her.
