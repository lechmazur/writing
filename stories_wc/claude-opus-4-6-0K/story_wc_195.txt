The greenhouse had no dawn. [5] Sir Edric knew this the way he knew the weight of his own silence — completely, without needing proof. [22] Endless night pressed against the glass panes, and inside, the alchemical orchard exhaled silver mist from bark that should not have been alive. [41] The trees grew in spirals, their roots drinking from copper channels filled with luminous solutions, their fruit glowing faintly amber and smelling of turned earth and starlight. [63] It was factually mystical, this place — not mystical in the way of legend, but in the way of a proven theorem no one had bothered to write down. [87]

He had withdrawn from everything: from court, from campaign, from the companionship of other knights who still believed their swords meant something beyond the cutting. [110] He had come here following a rumor of a garden that existed outside the reach of hours, where a person might stand still long enough to understand what they had been running from. [140] What he had not expected was the program. [148]

It lay on the stone bench near the third row of pomegranate-mercury hybrids, its cover water-stained and curling: an abandoned marionette theater program from a troupe called The Strings of Saint Varo. [178] The performances listed inside were strange — "The Duke Who Became Weather," "Lament for a Door That Opened Both Ways" — and between the acts, someone had filled the margins with diagrams. [206] Not illustrations. [208] Diagrams. [209] Geometric arrangements of lines and circles that Edric recognized, distantly, the way one recognizes a face from childhood. [224]

Forgotten patterns. [226]

He had seen them once, years ago, inscribed on the inner lining of his order's ceremonial armor — patterns the senior knights dismissed as decorative tradition. [248] But here they were again, sketched in faded ink beside puppet-show synopses, and something in Edric's chest tightened with a feeling he could only describe as shivering bliss, the thrill of a world confessing a secret it had kept too long. [289]

He traced the first pattern with his finger. [297] The air in the greenhouse changed. [303] Not temperature, not scent — texture. [308] As though reality itself had taken a breath and was holding it. [319]

Edric understood then what the patterns were for. [327] They were instructions, not for puppets, but for the strings between things — the invisible tensions connecting moment to moment, shape to shape. [348] The marionette troupe had known. [353] His knightly order had known. [358] Everyone had forgotten. [361]

He stood among the glowing trees and whispered the words that came to him, not from memory but from the geometry itself, syllables generated by angles. [385] A murmured allegiance — not to king, not to code, but to the vast trembling structure of what could be. [403] He pledged himself to possibility as though it were a sovereign deserving of devotion. [416]

The greenhouse shuddered. [419] Reality shifted. [421] The fruit on the alchemical trees ripened and unripened in the same instant, showing him every version of themselves at once. [439] The endless night outside the glass did not break, but it deepened, revealing layers — darkness behind darkness, each one a different unlived timeline. [460]

Edric reached for the clasp at his throat, the one fastening the gorget he still wore out of habit. [478] He let his fingers find the mechanism and unsnap it. [488] The armor piece fell to the mossy flagstones with a sound like a bell struck underwater. [502] With it went the last physical remnant of the knight he had been, and the withdrawal that had defined him cracked open into something larger. [524]

Through the forgotten patterns, he could see it now — the shape of possibility. [536] Not a single future, but the architecture of all futures, branching and folding like the orchard's spiral trees, and his task was not to choose one but to capture the shape entire, to hold it in his murmured oath and his open hands. [575]

The alchemical fruit pulsed. [579] The diagrams in the old program blazed briefly in his mind, then settled into his bones like a language he had always spoken. [599] Edric breathed. [601] The greenhouse breathed with him. [606] Somewhere in the endless dark, a string no one could see drew taut, connecting this withdrawn knight to every trembling possibility hanging ripe and unnamed on the branches above him. [634] He did not reach for his sword. [641] He reached for the nearest fruit, warm as a living hand, and understood that the shape he sought had been growing here all along, patient in perpetual night, waiting for someone quiet enough to notice. [672] For the first time in years, his silence was not retreat. [683] It was the fertile dark from which something luminous, something unnamed, could finally begin. [696]
