The floating rock dojo hung suspended above a canyon that hadn't existed yesterday. History was rewriting itself again—the canyon walls shifting from sandstone to basalt to something that looked like compressed bone—and Master Selu knelt on the training platform's edge, watching the geology of the world rearrange beneath her feet.

She had died once. [52] Not physically, but in every way that mattered. [60] Three years ago, a meditation gone catastrophically deep had dissolved her sense of self so completely that the woman who emerged could not feel joy, grief, or anger. [85] The ego death had stripped her clean, and what survived was a person who moved through the world like smoke through a keyhole—present but untouchable. [107] She had come to the floating rock dojo to defeat that emotional numbness, to learn how to vivify the dead terrain inside her chest. [130]

Today, however, she had a different problem. [137]

"The court summons arrived this morning," said her attorney, a wiry man named Dax who climbed the rope ladder wheezing. [157] He handed her a document stamped with the shifting insignia of the Temporal Judiciary. [169] "Your clone is petitioning for full custody of your daughter." [179]

Selu read the petition without expression. [185] Her clone—designated Selu-2, created during the Replication Mandate before history rewrote that law out of existence—had been raising Mira for the past fourteen months while Selu trained. [211] Now Selu-2 argued she was the more fit parent, that the original Selu was emotionally absent, hollowed out, incapable of love. [233]

The worst part was that Selu-2 might be right. [242]

She found her clone's evidence exhibit in the dojo's records chamber: a brain in a jar, labeled "DUPLICATE." [259] It was a neural scan, preserved in synthetic fluid, representing the exact cognitive snapshot taken before Selu's ego death. [278] Selu-2's lawyers intended to use it to prove that the original Selu's brain had fundamentally changed—that the woman who bore Mira no longer existed in any meaningful sense. [306]

Selu held the jar up to the light. [314] The brain floated, pink and ridged, a monument to who she used to be. [328] She felt nothing looking at it. [334] That was the problem. [338]

The custody hearing took place on the dojo's central platform, where two stone pillars marked the sparring ring. [355] The Temporal Judiciary permitted combat testimony—a tradition from a version of history that hadn't been erased yet. [372] Selu-2 stood opposite her, identical in face but radically different in bearing: warm-eyed, quick to smile, arms open. [390] She was everything Selu had been before the death. [399]

"You can't even cry," Selu-2 said, and the words sliced through pretense like a blade through silk. [415] "Mira needs a mother who feels." [421]

They fought. [423] Not with fists—the dojo's method demanded resolution through complementary opposites. [433] Where Selu-2 attacked with passionate fury, Selu answered with stillness. [443] Where Selu moved with precise, mechanical grace, Selu-2 countered with chaotic intuition. [454] They were two halves of one person, each incomplete, and as they circled each other the canyon below shifted again, rewriting another epoch into dust. [477]

Selu caught Selu-2's wrist mid-strike and held it. [486] Their eyes met. [489] In her clone's gaze she saw terror—not of losing the fight, but of being alone with all that feeling and no structure to hold it. [513] And in that recognition, something stirred in Selu's chest. [523] A hairline fracture in the numbness. [529]

"You're drowning in it," Selu whispered. [535] "You feel everything and it's destroying you." [542]

Selu-2's composure broke. [545] Tears streaked her face. [549] "And you feel nothing, and it's destroying you." [557]

The judge, an ancient woman whose robes changed color with each historical revision, watched them carefully. [571]

Selu released her clone's wrist. [576] "Mira doesn't need one of us," she said. [584] "She needs both. [587] The stillness and the storm." [592]

It was not a legal argument. [598] It was the first honest thing Selu had said in three years, and it vivified something in her that she thought the ego death had buried permanently—not joy exactly, but the raw ache of wanting, the first green shoot through scorched earth. [637]

The judge ruled for joint custody. [643] History rewrote itself once more beneath them, erasing the canyon entirely, replacing it with an ocean that sparkled under a sun that might not last the afternoon. [670]

Selu stood on the dojo's edge, her clone beside her, the brain in its jar between them like a strange reliquary. [691] Below, the new ocean churned with possibility. [698] Neither of them was whole. [703] Together, through their complementary brokenness, they might approximate something close enough to save a little girl from growing up the way either of them had. [728]

Selu breathed in. [731] The air tasted like salt and change. [738] For the first time in three years, she let herself want tomorrow. [750]
