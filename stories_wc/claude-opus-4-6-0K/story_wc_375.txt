The crystals remembered her daughter's laughter longer than the air did. [10] Maren pressed her charcoal-darkened fingers against the cavern wall and listened as the last echo faded into the mineral silence of the deep. [30] After the last echo of laughter fades, she thought, you learn what a cave really is: a throat that has swallowed every sound you ever loved. [53]

She had not descended into the subterranean crystal cave in three years, not since Lina was alive to make the climb worthwhile. [73] The formations still caught her headlamp and split the beam into pale violets and golds, a permanent dawn frozen underground, light perpetually arriving but never quite warming anything. [98] Auroral. [99] That was the word Lina used to love, rolling it across her tongue like candy. [113]

Maren was a portrait sketch artist by trade, or had been. [124] For eleven years she sat at the boardwalk easel, tourists lining up while she memorized their bone structures in a single glance and rendered them in charcoal faster than anyone believed possible. [152] She was mnemonically gifted in ways that made ordinary forgetting impossible. [162] Every face she had ever drawn lived archived behind her eyes: the tired mother from Gdansk, the twins from Montreal, the elderly man who wept when he saw himself made beautiful. [189] And Lina's face, of course, sharper than all the rest, drawn hundreds of times in the margins of receipts, on napkins, across the backs of envelopes, a compulsion she could not govern. [219]

After the accident, Maren locked her charcoal sets in a case and stopped. [232] She told herself the calling had simply ended, the way a river dries. [245] But inescapable callings do not dry. [251] They merely go underground, pooling in the dark like water finding caves, pressing against stone until something cracks. [266] Her hands ached at night. [271] She dreamed in crosshatch and contour. [277] She woke with phantom smudges on her fingertips and scrubbed them raw under the faucet, punishing a stain that was no longer there. [298]

She had come back today to rectify something. [307] Deep in the cave's second chamber, past the column of amethyst quartz Lina had named "the Bishop," Maren found what she was looking for: the painting. [333] It was a watercolor on heavy stock, sealed in resin to survive the moisture, mounted flush against the crystal wall. [352] Lina had made it at age nine, a lopsided portrait of Maren sketching at her easel, the charcoal fingers rendered in enthusiastic brown streaks. [373] Behind the painting, tucked in a natural alcove, was the lockbox. [384]

Maren pulled the painting away gently and lifted the metal box from its shelf of calcite. [399] The combination lock on its front was broken, the dial cracked from years of subterranean humidity warping the casing. [417] It did not matter. [421] She remembered the combination, as she remembered everything: Lina's birthday, reversed. [432] She pried the fractured mechanism loose with her thumbnail and opened the lid. [444]

Inside were Lina's sketchbooks, three of them, spiralbound, pages rippled with damp but intact. [458] Maren had hidden them here after the funeral because she could not bear to see them in the house, yet could not bear to destroy them. [483] Now she turned the pages under her headlamp and watched her daughter's gift unfold in developmental sequence: stick figures becoming bodies, circles becoming faces, rough gestures becoming something startlingly assured. [511] On the last filled page, Lina had drawn Maren's hands at work, the fingers dark with charcoal, and beneath the sketch had written in her careful ten-year-old print: "Mom's hands never stop making people real." [546]

Maren sat on the cave floor surrounded by crystal light that looked like the first minutes of every morning that would ever exist, and she wept in a way that was not collapse but opening, the way a bottle finally uncorked releases not just pressure but fragrance. [590] She understood now that suppressed creativity does not protect grief; it embalms it, keeps it airless and unchanged. [607] To create again was not to move past Lina but to move with her, carrying the same inescapable calling that had passed between their hands like charcoal dust. [634]

She reached into her coat pocket, where an old stick of willow charcoal had ridden for three years like a talisman she refused to acknowledge. [659] She pulled it free. [663] Her fingers darkened immediately at the contact, the old stain returning as if it had only been waiting. [678] She opened the first blank page of a sketchbook she had brought without admitting why and began, from her merciless memory, to draw her daughter laughing in a cave full of light. [709] The crystals caught the sound of charcoal on paper and held it the way they held everything, gently and for longer than seemed possible. [734]
