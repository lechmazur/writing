She had pruned orchards for forty years, and in that time Maren had learned that every cut was a doorway. [20]

Not metaphorically. [22]

The first time it happened, she was seventeen, shearing a dead limb from her grandmother's oldest apple tree. [41] The blade passed through bark, and the world split like a curtain, and for one breath she stood in a garden that hummed with colors she had no names for. [68] Then the limb fell, the wound sealed with sap, and she was back in the orchard with dirt under her nails and her heart stammering. [92]

Forty years of weaving between worlds had taught her this: every tree held a seam, and every seam opened onto a place where wonder still lived in its original, undiluted pigment. [122] The trouble was that the seams were thinning. [130] The orchards she tended grew duller each spring, their blossoms fading to a washed-out rose, their fruit tasting of something almost forgotten. [151] The color of wonder was bleeding out of the world like dye from old cloth. [165]

Maren was insatiably creative in her efforts to stop the loss. [176] She had tried grafting branches from one world onto trunks in another, painting sigils in tree sap, singing the old songs her grandmother once hummed at twilight. [202] Some methods slowed the fading. [207] None reversed it. [210]

Then, upon the hush of budding hope — that fragile week in early spring when the first buds swelled but had not yet opened, when the world held its breath between winter's death and summer's promise — she found the heirloom seed. [248]

It was tucked inside the heartwood of a pear tree she was pruning on a hillside above the river. [267] The trunk had split in a storm, revealing a hollow, and inside the hollow sat a seed no larger than her thumbnail, wrapped in a membrane that shimmered like oil on water. [299] She recognized it the way she recognized her own hands: without explanation, with absolute certainty. [313] This was the seed her grandmother had spoken of, the one that grew in both worlds at once, its roots in one soil and its crown in another. [340]

Maren carried it down to the verdant parapet beside the waterfall, the stone ledge thick with moss and fern where the river hurled itself over the cliff in a curtain of white noise. [372] This was where the seam was widest, where mist from the falls made the air shimmer and the boundary between here and there grew thin as breath. [399]

She knelt on the wet stone and pressed the seed into a crack where soil had gathered. [416] Then she closed her eyes and did what she did best: she pruned. [429] Not a branch this time, but the membrane between worlds, cutting away the dead growth of separation, opening a channel through which essence could flow. [452]

The method had come to her in a dream — by capturing essence, distilling the raw wonder of that other place into something the seed could drink. [477] She cupped her hands around the crack and breathed slowly, drawing the mist of two worlds into her palms. [496] The waterfall roared its quiet roar. [502] Light pooled between her fingers, not sunlight and not moonlight but something older, a radiance that hummed at a frequency she felt in her teeth. [524]

The seed drank. [527]

It split its membrane and sent a white root spiraling into the stone. [539] A shoot rose, pale green, trembling, and Maren offered it succor — her warmth, her breath, her forty years of knowing which cuts heal and which ones kill. [567] She whispered to it the way she whispered to every tree she'd ever tended, telling it where to reach and how to hold. [590]

By dusk the shoot stood a foot tall, its leaves catching colors that had no business existing in this faded world: a blue deeper than any sky, a gold that ached, a green so alive it seemed to breathe. [627] The waterfall's mist carried those colors outward in fine droplets, and where they landed the moss blazed emerald, the ferns unfurled in joyous spirals, the stone itself seemed to remember what it meant to be new. [663]

Maren sat back on her heels and watched the radiant hush settle over the parapet like a blessing. [681] The tree would grow. [685] Its roots would thread through the seam and hold both worlds together, and its fruit would carry seeds, and she would plant them in every orchard she touched. [710]

She was old and her knees ached and the mist had soaked her through. [724] But the color of wonder was returning, one impossible hue at a time, and Maren — wise, tired, insatiably creative Maren — picked up her pruning shears and smiled. [753]

There would be more seams to open tomorrow. [761]

There always were. [764]
