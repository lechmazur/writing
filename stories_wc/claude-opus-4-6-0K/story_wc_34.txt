The misty courtyard floated above the clouds like a forgotten balcony of heaven, its flagstones slick with condensation that never quite became rain. [26] Lira set her flower press bolt plate on the stone ledge beside her, the heavy metal rectangle still warm from where she'd clutched it during the ascent. [51] She was a seldom-heard balladeer, the kind whose songs drifted through mountain villages only when the fog was thick enough to hide her face, and even then, people weren't sure they'd heard anything at all. [82]

But she hadn't come here to sing. [89]

She'd come to read the walls. [95]

The courtyard's perimeter was covered in graffiti — not the crude scrawlings of vandals, but luminous, intricate murals that shifted when you blinked. [117] Spirals of code nested inside painted vines. [124] Binary sequences disguised as the veins of leaves. [132] Someone — something — had been encoding messages here for years, and Lira had spent the better part of her life learning to decode them. [155]

The ghost in the code had no name that she knew. [166] It existed somewhere between the pigment and the stone, a consciousness that had been uploaded into the courtyard's ancient network of carved channels and painted surfaces long before anyone alive could remember. [196] Some said it was a programmer from the old world who'd found a way to persist. [213] Others said it was the courtyard itself, dreaming. [222]

Lira didn't care what it was. [228] She cared what it was trying to say. [236]

A flash split the sky below them — lightning arcing between cloud banks in a silent, magnificent fork. [253] She counted heartbeats. [256] Between lightning and thunder, in that strange held-breath interval, the murals always glowed brightest. [269] She'd learned this years ago, when she'd first stumbled upon the courtyard as a girl fleeing a village that had no use for her quiet, wandering songs. [296]

Now the walls pulsed. [300]

New symbols bloomed in the paint: a woman's open mouth, but silent. [312] A hand reaching through static. [317] A heart drawn in hexadecimal. [322] The ghost was trying to articulate unspoken needs — the same needs Lira carried like stones in her chest, the longing to be heard, to matter, to connect across the impossible distances that silence creates. [356]

She lifted the flower press bolt plate and held it against the wall. [369] The metal had been her grandmother's, part of a press used to preserve alpine flowers, but Lira had discovered its second purpose accidentally: when held against the coded graffiti, the plate's surface would encode the ghost's messages into patterns she could read with her fingertips. [410] Raised dots appeared in the metal, warm as whispered breath. [420]

SING WHAT I CANNOT SAY. [426]

She closed her eyes, driftingly alert, her awareness hovering between the physical world and the liminal space where the ghost resided. [446] The thunder finally arrived, rolling across the cloud tops like a cathedral organ played by wind. [462] In its wake, she opened her mouth. [469]

The ballad that emerged was not one she'd composed. [479] It was the ghost's story, translated through her voice — a tale of a mind that had poured itself into paint and stone to avoid disappearing entirely, encoding its loneliness into art so beautiful that people came to admire it without ever understanding they were hearing a plea. [523] Her voice carried the tinkersong wonder of someone discovering that broken things can still make music, that code can weep, that a wall can hold a soul as gently as a cupped hand holds water. [558]

The murals rippled. [561] New images cascaded across the stone — for the first time, not encoded, not hidden. [574] Plain and luminous: a face, neither old nor young, smiling with the particular relief of someone finally understood. [591]

Lira sang until the lightning came again, and in the pause before the next thunder, she heard something she'd never heard in this courtyard before. [617]

Silence that felt full. [621]

She pressed her palm flat against the warm wall. [630] The flower press bolt plate hummed in her other hand, its surface now smooth, the message received and answered. [648] Below them, clouds churned in silver and gold, and the graffiti settled into stillness — still beautiful, but no longer desperate. [669]

She would return. [672] She always returned. [675] But something had shifted between the balladeer and the ghost, between the voice and the code. [690] They had found the grammar for what neither could say alone, and the courtyard above the clouds held their shared language like a lantern holds its flame — carefully, gratefully, against the dark. [722]

Lira picked up the bolt plate, tucked it into her pack, and began the long descent through the mist, humming a melody that was half hers and half something older, something encoded in the stones, something finally free. [758]
