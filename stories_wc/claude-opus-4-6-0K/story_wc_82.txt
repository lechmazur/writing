The glass basilica caught the last light of a sun that should not have been setting upward, its transparent spires refracting grief into colors that had no names in the waking world. [32]

Maren sat in the floating island tea garden that wrapped around the basilica's eastern nave, her fingers stained with lamp oil and sorrow, polishing a gem she had cut from her own recorded dream. [63] She was a crafty lantern maker by trade, known across the drifting archipelagos for building lights that remembered what they had seen, but here in this garden suspended above an abyss of clouds, she practiced a different art. [98] She folded paper cranes from sheets thin as breath, each one inscribed with a name she could no longer speak aloud. [117]

The tea garden floated on its isle like a thought refusing to dissolve upon waking. [131] Thermal jasmine grew in terraced rows between stone tables, and the leaves steeped themselves in morning fog, producing a brew that tasted of altitude and longing. [157] Maren poured a cup but did not drink. [164] She watched the steam curl upward, dissolving against the basilica's glass walls, and remembered her daughter's voice the way one remembers a melody heard only in sleep. [191]

It had been three months since Luma died, and one month since Maren discovered that the recording apparatus she used for her lanterns could capture dreams. [217] She had been calibrating a new filament when she fell asleep at her workbench and woke to find the gem beside her glowing with the scene she had just dreamed: Luma at seven, laughing in a field of paper birds. [254] Dream recording, she realized, was not invention but excavation, a way to mine the sleeping mind for what the waking mind refused to hold. [277]

Now she polished each dream-gem with the same meticulous pressure she applied to lantern lenses, using fine-grained obsidian paste and a cloth soaked in tea from this very garden. [305] Gem polishing was meditation and transformation both, the slow revelation of clarity from rough stone. [319] Each pass of the cloth stripped another layer of distortion until the dream inside burned true. [334]

The shadow detached at dusk. [339]

It happened every evening on the floating isle, a phenomenon the old gardeners called the Severance: after the shadow detaches from the body, it descends into the cloud abyss while the body, paradoxically, feels itself ascending. [372] Maren descends while ascending, her shadow pooling downward through the gaps in the garden's lattice floor as her chest lifts, weightless, toward the basilica's highest spire. [398] In this split state, between gravity and grace, the dream-gems activated. [409]

Light erupted from the polished stone in her palm, projecting Luma onto the glass walls of the basilica. [426] Not a ghost, not a memory, but a recorded dream given architectural scale, her daughter's laughter filling the nave like an organ chord. [448] The glass basilica on its floating isle became a cathedral of recollection, every transparent surface alive with the amber glow of a child who once existed and now existed again in light. [479]

Maren watched and wept and folded. [485]

Her hands moved without instruction, pressing paper into wings, into beaks, into the precise geometries of cranes. [501] To fold grief into origami cranes was not to diminish it but to transform it, to give formless anguish a body it could inhabit, a shape that suggested flight. [530] Each crane she finished, she placed on the tea table beside her cooling cup, and each one caught the projected dreamlight and glowed as if incubating a small fire. [559]

By the time her shadow returned, crawling back up through the lattice to reattach itself to her feet, she had made forty-seven cranes and the dream-gem had dimmed to an ember. [592] The basilica's walls held the fading afterimage of Luma's face, thinning like breath on cold glass. [609]

Maren gathered the cranes into a lantern she had brought for this purpose, one she had built with a hollow core designed to house folded paper and polished gems together. [639] When she lit the wick, the cranes' shadows danced on the basilica walls, enormous and alive, and for a luminous, tormenting moment the boundary between dreaming and waking dissolved entirely. [669]

She hung the lantern from the lowest branch of the jasmine tree and left it burning. [685]

Tomorrow she would sleep again and harvest new gems, polish new facets, fold new cranes. [700] The grief would not end, but it would take flight, crane by crane, light by light, ascending from the body even as the body descends into another night of dreaming. [730]

The tea grew cold. [734] The basilica glowed. [737] Somewhere in the lantern, a paper crane trembled as if remembering how to breathe. [750]
