The canyon had no name that anyone living could remember, but the bones remembered everything. [16]

Towers of pale calcium rose from the canyon floor like the fingers of something vast and buried, each one layered with centuries of dust that settled in rings like the growth bands of ancient trees. [49] Between them, every sound returned multiplied—a whisper became a chorus, a footstep became a march, and silence itself seemed to hum with the ghosts of prior noise. [75] This was where Seren had lived for longer than she could account for, skimming stones across the flat echo-pools that collected at the base of the bone towers, listening to the harmonics they made. [104]

She was a harmonic stone skimmer, the last practitioner of a discipline so old it predated the towers themselves. [122] Each stone she cast sang a different frequency depending on its mineral composition, its weight, the angle of release, and the surface it kissed. [143] The canyon's endless echoes carried those frequencies back to her in overlapping waves, and from the interference patterns she could read distances, densities, the shape of spaces she had never physically entered. [172] She was learning to navigate without moving. [179]

That was the whole point—had always been the whole point, through centuries of layered dust that buried her predecessors and their predecessors before them. [201] The original skimmers believed that if you could map every resonance in the canyon, you could understand the pulse that had been left wandering here since before the bone towers calcified. [230] A pulse left wandering: not a heartbeat, not a sound, but something between intention and vibration, the residual will of whatever creature's skeleton formed the canyon walls. [256] It moved through the towers endlessly, never arriving, never dissipating, and Seren had spent decades trying to find its frequency. [275]

She knelt beside the echo-pool at dawn, her knees pressing into dust that compressed like memory under weight. [293] In her hand she turned a stone arrowhead, appraising it with the reverence she gave all artifacts pulled from the sediment. [313] It was historically significant—not as a weapon, but as a tuning implement. [325] The old skimmers had chipped arrowheads not to hunt but to create precise acoustic profiles. [339] This one was obsidian, knapped to a geometry that would produce a tone she had never been able to replicate with river stones. [360]

She held it to the light and studied its edges, then looked upward where a flock of birds wheeled between the towers. [382] Their formation shifted—contracting, expanding, splitting and reforming—and Seren read their patterns the way a sailor reads wind. [400] Through the patterns in a flock of birds in flight, she could appraise atmospheric density, thermal currents, the invisible architecture of pressure that shaped the canyon's acoustics on any given morning. [429] Today the birds flew in tight spirals, which meant the air was dense and cool, ideal for low-frequency propagation. [448]

She cast the arrowhead. [452]

It left her fingers with a practiced flick and kissed the surface of the echo-pool seven times before sinking. [470] Each skip produced a tone deeper than any she had heard from this pool—a resonance that dropped below the threshold of casual hearing and entered the body through the sternum. [499] The bone towers caught it and sent it back, and back, and back, each return layering over the last until the canyon thrummed with a sound that was less heard than inhabited. [531]

And then, beneath all those reflections, she heard it. [540]

The wandering pulse. [543]

It was not loud. [547] It was not dramatic. [551] It was the quietest thing in the canyon, which was why it had taken so long to find—every echo had been obscuring it for centuries. [575] But the obsidian arrowhead's frequency matched it precisely enough to create a moment of constructive interference, a brief amplification that let Seren feel the pulse align with her own heartbeat. [604]

She closed her eyes. [608] The canyon mapped itself behind her eyelids—every tower, every pool, every fissure rendered in sound. [624] She did not need to walk its passages. [631] She did not need to move at all. [638] The pulse carried the shape of the entire space within it, a wandering cartography that had been waiting for someone patient enough to listen at the right frequency. [664]

Seren exhaled, and the dust around her knees stirred and resettled. [675] The birds above reformed into a wide, unhurried gyre. [684] The echoes faded into their familiar hum. [691]

She had not moved, and she had arrived everywhere. [700]

The canyon's bones held their silence like a promise kept, and Seren, weathered and resolute, began to skim another stone. [720]
