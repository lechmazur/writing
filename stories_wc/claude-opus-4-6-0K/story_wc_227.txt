The workshop drifted on the acid sea like a wound refusing to close, its massive copper pontoons hissing where the vitriol lapped against them, dissolving metal into green froth that the current carried nowhere. [36] Inside, the gears turned without purpose, cogs meshing and unspooling in walls of brass and iron, their rhythms syncopated like the heartbeat of something that had forgotten why it lived. [62] Maren stood at her workbench, uncertain as always, her fingers hovering over a crucible of molten gold that threw light across her scarred face. [83]

She was an alchemist, though she had long stopped believing in transmutation. [94] What she believed in now was smaller and more desperate: the idea that broken things could be joined along their fractures, and that the joining could mean more than the original wholeness ever did. [124] Kintsugi, the old texts called it. [130] She called it the only prayer she had left. [139]

Before her on the bench lay the statue, no taller than her forearm, carved from black basalt centuries ago by hands belonging to a civilization the acid sea had swallowed. [166] Its surface was riddled with pockmarks, tiny craters where the stone had bubbled and scarred during some ancient catastrophe. [183] Maren had spent weeks studying those pockmarks, mapping their constellations, because she believed they were a language. [198] She believed they could narrate the story of what had been lost. [209]

On her left hand, threaded through her smallest finger like a ring, hung a key ring charm: a tiny golden gear no bigger than a thumbnail, given to her by her mother before the sea rose and took the lowland cities. [247] She touched it now, a reflex, the way one touches a scar to remember the wound. [263] The charm was the first thing she had ever repaired with gold, soldering its cracked teeth back together after she'd crushed it in her fist the night her mother drowned. [291] That mended gear was her template, her proof of concept. [301] Breakage could be beautiful. [305] Breakage could hold. [308]

She dipped her brush into the molten gold and began. [318]

The pockmarks on the statue's chest matched a pattern she had found on the workshop's central drive shaft, a sequence of dents hammered in by some forgotten engineer. [345] By matching the pockmarks on the centuries-old statue to those dents, she had decoded a frequency, a resonance that the gears could produce if she set them spinning at precisely the right configuration. [376] That resonance, her calculations promised, would open something. [385] A door, a memory, a world beneath the acid. [394] She did not know which. [399] This was the source of her uncertainty, the tremor in her hands. [411]

She filled each pockmark with gold, sealing the statue's scars with luminous thread until the black stone blazed with a network of golden veins. [435] Each filled crater was a syllable restored. [442] Each line of gold quilted one memory to the next, stitching together fragments of a drowned civilization's final testimony, connecting the statue's ancient grief to her own. [467] The process quilts memories together, she had written in her journal. [478] Mine and theirs. [481] The gold does not distinguish. [486]

When she finished, the statue hummed. [492]

Maren carried it to the central shaft and placed it in the cradle she had built there. [508] The gears caught the resonance and amplified it, cog teeth clicking into new alignments, the whole workshop shuddering as its purposeless machinery suddenly found purpose. [531] The copper floor vibrated. [535] The acid sea outside began to glow. [542]

She understood now that she would have to go under. [552] The door was below. [556] She pulled the breathing mask from its hook, knowing it would give her only seconds, a handful of moments between breaths held underwater where the acid would press against the glass and she would either find what the statue promised or dissolve into the same green nothing that had taken everything else. [601]

She stepped onto the lowering platform. [607] The vitriol rose around her ankles, warm and electric. [616]

To conjure meaning from the edge of oblivion, she told herself. [627] That is why. [630]

The platform sank. [633] The acid closed over her head, and in that held-breath silence between one world and the next, the golden scars on the statue above blazed like a constellation, and the gears sang a song that had waited centuries for someone uncertain enough to listen, someone who knew that the cracks were where the light was meant to go. [686]

Below her, in the glowing deep, something opened. [694]

Maren exhaled into her mask and swam toward it, the key ring charm glinting on her finger, a tiny mended gear carrying her forward into the luminous unknown. [722]
