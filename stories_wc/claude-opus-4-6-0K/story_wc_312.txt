The sapphire viaduct stretched across the valley like a frozen river of light, its ancient stone catching the first pale fire of dawn. [24] Cael stood at its center, holding a broken ship's bell in both hands, feeling the crack that split its lip run beneath his thumbs like a scar that would never close. [51] He was, by every honest measure, a lukewarm mage—the kind whose fire spells produced tepid warmth, whose ice conjurations dripped before they froze, whose instructors had passed him through the academy with sighs rather than praise. [84] But he was here, and no one else was. [92]

The last fish had been caught three days ago. [101] Not the last fish in the river or the last fish in the province, but the last fish anywhere—the final living specimen of a species called the echo trout, pulled from the deep channel beneath this very viaduct by a fisherman who hadn't known what he'd done. [143] The echo trout had been, according to texts Cael barely understood, a keystone creature, one of the living threads that kept the cosmic lattice from unraveling. [168] Without it, the world's fundamental sympathies had begun to fracture. [178] Water no longer remembered how to fall at consistent rates. [188] Time pooled in some places and ran dry in others. [198] The stars at night stuttered like candle flames in wind. [208]

Cael believed he could fix it. [214] That was the earnestly naive part of him, the part that had never been weathered into cynicism despite every mediocre grade, every pitying look. [236] He believed because the old texts said the ship's bell—this specific bell, salvaged from the wreck of the *Meridian*, a vessel that had once carried the echo trout across oceans—still held a resonance. [266] If he could rebuild the bell's tone, he could rebuild the sympathetic frequency the trout had anchored, and the lattice would hold. [287]

The method was absurd, which was why it might work. [297] The viaduct's sapphire stone wept at dawn, condensation gathering in its crystalline pores and dripping in patterns that shifted with temperature and humidity. [319] Those dripping rates, the old texts claimed, corresponded to the base frequencies of the cosmic lattice itself—a kind of natural metronome that the world used to keep time with its own deeper rhythms. [350] Cael had spent two weeks learning to read those drips, counting them, mapping their intervals, understanding their language the way a musician understands silence between notes. [376]

Now he needed to mend the bell to match. [386]

He set it on the viaduct's stone railing and placed his hands on either side of the crack. [403] His magic rose—warm, not hot, never hot—and seeped into the bronze like sunlight through clouded glass. [420] He could feel the metal's memory of wholeness, its brittle devotion to the shape it had once been. [438] That was the trouble with devotion, he thought. [447] It could hold something together for centuries and then shatter in an instant, not from any great blow but from the accumulated weight of time and neglect. [472] The bell had been devoted to its tone, and then the *Meridian* had sunk, and the bell had cracked against a reef, and the devotion had become a memory of devotion, which was a different and more fragile thing. [508]

He listened to the drips. [513] Three in quick succession, then a pause, then one, then two. [524] He let the rhythm enter his hands and flow into the bronze, coaxing the fractured edges together not with force but with timing. [546] The metal resisted, then softened, then began to remember. [556]

Dawn climbed higher. [559] The sapphire stone blazed blue around him, and the dripping quickened as the air warmed. [572] Cael adjusted, his lukewarm magic perfectly suited to this work that required patience rather than power, a gentle persistence rather than brilliance. [592] For once, his inadequacy was exactly adequate. [599]

The crack sealed. [602] Not perfectly—a faint line remained, a scar in the bronze. [613] But when the last drop fell from the viaduct's weeping stone and Cael struck the bell with his knuckle, the tone that rang out was impossible and true. [641] It spread across the valley, and the stuttering stars—still faintly visible in the brightening sky—steadied. [656] Water in the river below resumed its proper fall. [665] Somewhere, in the deep channels of the world's memory, a frequency locked back into place, and the lattice held. [683]

Cael sat down on the viaduct, cradling the mended bell, and wept with a relief so vast it embarrassed him. [702] He was still a lukewarm mage. [709] The world was still fragile, its devotion to its own continuation as brittle as ever. [723] But for this one dawn, on this sapphire bridge, the impossible had been plausible, and that was enough. [740]
