The crystalline orchard had no name anyone could pronounce, not anymore. Its designation belonged to a tongue that had dissolved centuries before memory learned to hold still, and now the trees stood in their glass-bright silence at the lip of the shimmering crater, catching light and splitting it into spectrums that hurt the chest more than the eyes. [55]

Vael worked there, among the branches, pulling reeds from the marsh that pooled in the crater's lowest bowl and twisting them into figures that held the shapes of people who had never existed. [86] A marsh-reed sculptor, they called her in the settlement three ridges east, though she had never been formally welcomed into that settlement or any other. [109] She lived at the orchard's edge because edges were the only geography she understood. [122]

At the center of the orchard rose the glimmering obsidian arbor, a structure so old its origins had passed beyond the murmur of lost languages into pure conjecture. [147] Its black lattice caught the crystalline light and transformed it into something darker, warmer, a glow that pulsed like a living thing's slow breath. [170] Vael sculpted beneath it most mornings, letting its strange illumination guide her fingers as she wove reed into rib cage, reed into reaching hand. [193]

She was building a family. [197]

Not from flesh, because flesh required someone willing to stay, but from the marsh's long fibers, bent and knotted into figures she arranged in constellations around the arbor. [224] A grandmother with arms wide enough to hold weather. [233] A brother mid-laugh. [236] A child stepping forward on one foot, forever brave, forever about to arrive. [248] Each figure she would dedicate to a bond she had never possessed, pressing her thumb into the woven chest and whispering a name she invented on the spot. [274]

It was the child figure that brought Korin to her. [283]

He appeared one afternoon at the orchard's perimeter, a young man with crater dust on his boots and a question caught between his teeth. [305] He carried a scrap of pressed bark on which someone had drawn a symbol: three reeds braided into a circle, bisected by a single dark line. [332]

"I've been searching for whoever leaves this mark," he said. [342] "I've found it on walls in six settlements, on bridges, on the underside of market stalls. [358] No one claims it." [361]

Vael looked at the symbol and felt the obsidian arbor's warmth shift against her back. [375] It was her mark. [378] She had been pressing it into surfaces for years during her rare trips beyond the orchard, a quiet graffiti, a tag left by an elusive street artist who wanted to be found but could not bear to ask. [413]

"Why do you want to find the artist?" she asked, not yet confessing. [425]

Korin sat among her reed figures and touched the grandmother's open hand with a tenderness that made Vael's breath stall. [443] "Because whoever makes this symbol understands something about belonging that I need to learn," he said. [459] "I was orphaned into a community that tolerates me. [467] Tolerance is not kinship." [471]

Boldly sympathetic, Vael thought, the way only the deeply lonely can be, willing to hand a stranger the precise wound and trust them not to press. [496]

She told him. [498]

And then, because telling was not enough, she showed him: the method of braiding reed, the way the fibers remembered the shape of water even after drying, the way you could weave two figures so their hands interlocked and neither could stand without the other. [538] They worked together beneath the obsidian arbor as the crater shimmered its late-afternoon palette of violet and molten gold. [555]

Over the following weeks Korin returned, and sometimes he brought others who had seen the tag and followed its trail. [574] A woman who sang in a dialect no one else spoke. [584] A man who mapped craters and had never once been mapped himself. [595] They gathered in the crystalline orchard and learned to sculpt, and each figure they made they dedicated to a connection they were choosing rather than inheriting, webs of kinship spun from intention and need. [628]

Vael watched the arbor fill with reed people standing in circles, holding hands, leaning into each other. [644] The luminescent ache she had carried for years did not vanish. [654] It changed. [656] It became the particular brightness that lives inside a lamp when someone has finally thought to light it, not for themselves, but because they heard footsteps approaching in the dark and wanted whoever arrived to know: here, you are expected. [695]

She grafted herself onto community the only way she knew how, by making the space where community could grow, and then standing inside it, reed in hand, waiting to be woven in return. [729]
