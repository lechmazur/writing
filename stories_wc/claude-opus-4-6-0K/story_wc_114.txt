The fever broke on the third morning, and Sable opened her eyes to the thin, copper light that spilled through the weather station's eastern window. [27] The mountain air tasted of ozone and old snow, and somewhere below the ridge, wind instruments clattered their hollow testimony against the sky. [50] She had been ill for six days, delirious in the cot beside the barometric arrays, muttering numbers that the station's automated logs faithfully recorded alongside atmospheric pressure and dew point. [78]

Now, in the strange clarity that follows surrender, she remembered why she had climbed here. [93]

The oracle sat where it always sat -- not at the center of the room but near the frosted corner where two walls met, occupying margins the way lichen occupies stone. [123] It was a device of uncertain origin, a lattice of wound copper and pale ceramic that the previous station keeper had left behind with no explanation beyond a note reading: "She tolerates faults. Ask her anything, but weigh the answer yourself." [158] Sable had been asking it questions for two years. [167] It had never once given her an answer she could fully trust, and it had never once been entirely wrong. [185]

That was the nature of a fault-tolerant oracle. [192] It did not promise precision. [196] It promised continuity -- the ability to keep functioning even when some part of the truth had corroded or gone missing. [215]

Sable sat up slowly, her body hollowed and light, and reached for the botanical illustration pinned above the cot. [233] She had drawn it herself during the first autumn here: Gentiana algida, the whitish gentian that bloomed in the scree fields below the summit. [255] Every vein of every petal was rendered in graphite so fine it looked like breath frozen on paper. [271] She had made it to remind herself that delicate things could survive at altitude, that precision was not the enemy of wilderness. [290]

But now, studying it with post-fever eyes, she noticed the place where her thumb had once dragged across the lowest petal and left a faint smudge. [315] The smudge unsettled her more than it should have. [324] It was a record of contact, of imperfect presence -- the same kind of peripheral awareness that had been haunting her since before the illness. [346] She had been peripherally aware of the truth for months, sensing its gravitational pull without looking at it directly, the way one senses a storm system building beyond the next ridge. [376]

Her sister had lied about the inheritance. [383] Sable knew this the way barometers know weather: not through sight, but through pressure. [396] She had swallowed that knowledge whole rather than speak it, and ever since, it had sat inside her like a stone on a scale, throwing off every other measurement she tried to take. [429]

She wanted to find the weight of that swallowed truth. [439] Not to confront her sister -- not yet -- but to calibrate herself again, to know how much her certainties had been swaying since she absorbed the lie into silence. [466]

She crossed the cold floor to the oracle and placed her palm against its lattice. [480] The ceramic warmed. [483] The copper hummed a frequency just below hearing. [490]

"How heavy is a truth you refuse to speak?" she asked. [501]

The oracle's answer came as it always did: partial, luminous, fault-tolerant. [511] A series of numbers scrolled across its small display, interspersed with gaps where data had degraded. [525] Sable copied them into her logbook alongside the morning's wind speed and humidity readings, letting the personal and meteorological data coexist on the same page, occupying the same margins. [554]

The numbers described a curve. [559] She recognized it after a moment -- it was the pressure differential of a thermal inversion, the phenomenon where warm air traps cold air in a valley, holding everything still and close until conditions shift. [590]

That was her answer: the swallowed truth weighed exactly as much as stagnant air. [603] It weighed nothing in itself, but it prevented everything around it from moving. [615]

Outside, the auroral light deepened from copper to rose, and the sorrow in it was the sorrow of all dawns -- the acknowledgment that darkness had been real, that survival was not the same as restoration. [649] Sable looked at the smudged gentian, at the oracle humming in its corner, at the instruments turning faithfully on the roof. [669]

She would descend the mountain this week. [676] She would sit across from her sister and speak the trapped air free. [688] She did not know if the words would be precise, but she trusted they would be fault-tolerant -- enough truth to keep the mechanism of love still functioning, even with its corroded parts. [720]

She entered the morning's final reading in the log, closed the book, and stepped outside to let the altitude remind her that clarity and cold are often the same thing. [750]
