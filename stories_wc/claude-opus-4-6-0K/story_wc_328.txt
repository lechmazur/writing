The herbalist's underground garden stretched beneath the abandoned grain elevator like a cathedral of roots and grow-lights, where feverfew and mugwort thrived in hydroponic troughs carved from old limestone. Maren tended the rows each evening, her cover identity as an herbal apothecary so deeply worn it had become a second skin. [50]

But she was, and had always been, a cryptid researcher working undercover. [62]

Three years she'd tracked the phenomenon the locals called the Hollowing — livestock found weightless in fields, stones drifting upward from creek beds, entire flocks of starlings suspended mid-murmur as though gravity had forgotten its purpose. [94] Something lived beneath this stretch of Nebraska prairie, something gravitationally playful, and Maren intended to document it before the Department of Agricultural Anomalies buried the evidence again. [118]

Everything changed after the missing return changed. [125]

For two decades, seventeen people had vanished from Tillman County without explanation. [136] Then, one October morning after the first hard frost, they began coming back — not aged, not traumatized, but altered. [153] They hummed frequencies that made fillings ache. [160] They moved as though the earth's pull was a suggestion they could politely decline. [173] And every one of them carried the same object: a flint arrowhead, knapped with impossible precision, warm to the touch even in freezing air. [195]

Maren obtained hers from Dale Jessup, the seventh returnee, who pressed it into her palm in the garden one night while his boots hovered an inch above the limestone floor. [224] "You'll need this," he said, "for when it decides to talk to you." [236]

It spoke through the old cordless phone she kept on the potting bench — a relic from the nineties, its battery half-dead, its signal range laughable. [258] She'd kept it because its static sounded like breathing when the Hollowing was active overhead. [271] But after the returns, the static began to shape itself into confessions. [282]

Voices layered over voices, the returned whispering things they'd never say aloud: that the place below the prairie was not a prison but a harmony untamed, a living resonance where matter and energy refused hierarchy. [313] That they had been invited, not taken. [320] That bitterness — the long grief of the families, the paranoia of the town, the corrosive suspicion — was the only cage that had ever existed. [341]

Maren listened night after night, the cordless phone crackling against her ear, the flint arrowhead warm in her other hand, and felt her researcher's objectivity begin to metamorphose into something less clinical and more terrifying: belief. [373]

She had come to Tillman County armored in skepticism, motivated by the professional bitterness of a scientist whose papers had been laughed out of conferences, whose career was a punchline. [400] She wanted proof not to illuminate truth but to turn bitterness into a cosmic joke — to hold irrefutable evidence before the faces of every colleague who'd mocked her and say, "The universe is stranger than your tenure." [434]

But the confessions on the phone unmade that motive slowly, the way frost unmakes a petal. [449] The voices spoke of release, of letting resentment become absurd, of discovering that the cosmic joke was not a weapon but a gift — that laughter and grief were the same vibration at different frequencies. [480]

On the coldest night of November, the garden's grow-lights flickered and the limestone floor began to hum. [496] Maren felt the arrowhead pulse. [501] The phone erupted with every voice at once, a choir of static-laden joy, and gravity softened around her like a held breath released. [521] Her boots left the ground. [526] The mugwort swayed upward. [530] Water from the hydroponic troughs rose in silver ribbons. [539]

She understood then that the thing beneath the prairie was not a cryptid to be cataloged. [553] It was a frequency, and the flint arrowhead was a tuning fork, and the garden — roots reaching down toward that resonance — had been an antenna all along. [577]

She could descend. [580] She could join the harmony untamed, let her body metamorphose into something gravitationally unbound. [591] Or she could stay, document what she'd felt, and carry the frostbitten hope of it back into a world that would call her crazy. [614]

Maren set the cordless phone down gently. [621] She pocketed the arrowhead. [625] She let her boots touch limestone again. [631]

She chose to stay — not because she doubted what was below, but because the world above needed someone who had heard the joke and could repeat it with a straight face until the laughter finally caught. [665]

The static on the phone settled into what sounded, unmistakably, like applause. [677]
