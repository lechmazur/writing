The leash broke at dusk, and the dog vanished into the fog that clung to the veiled ridgeway like a breath held too long. [25]

Maren stood there with the frayed leather still warm in her hand, watching the place where her father's old hound had disappeared between the standing stones. [51] The ridge path stretched in both directions, half-swallowed by cloud, and she knew she should turn back toward the harbor village below. [72] But something in the way the fog parted -- deliberate, almost inviting -- made her step forward instead. [87]

She had come to this island to scatter her father's ashes, and she had not done it. [103] Three days she'd carried the urn in her backpack, walking the coastal trails he'd loved, and three days she'd found reasons to wait. [126] Tomorrow the weather might be better. [132] Tomorrow the light might be right. [138] Tomorrow she might feel brave enough to let him go. [148]

Now the dog was gone, the last living thing that remembered his voice, and the ridge was darkening around her. [167]

She followed the hound's tracks where she could, but the path forked and forked again, and soon she was traversing the ridgeway through indirect routes she hadn't known existed -- sheep trails that switchbacked through heather, stone corridors between outcrops that funneled the wind into low, singing notes. [211] The fog thinned in places to reveal the sea far below, silver and rhythmic, its waves keeping time like a lullaby sung to an empty shore. [238]

That was when she found the ferry station. [246]

It shouldn't have been there, halfway up a ridge with no water in sight, but there it stood: a wooden shelter with a bench, a posted schedule too weathered to read, and a lantern burning steadily against the mist. [281] Two figures sat inside, wrapped in oilskin coats the color of wet stone. [294]

"You're looking for something," said the nearer one, a woman with silver hair braided close to her scalp. [312] Her voice carried the same cadence as the waves below -- gentle, persistent, never quite stopping. [326]

"My dog," Maren said. [330]

"Sit," said the other guide, a broad man with hands that moved slowly and precisely. [345] He held a ticket punch, and when he pressed it against a slip of paper, it left a small star-shaped hole. [366] He held the paper up to the lantern, and the star glowed. [378] "The dog knows where it's going. [384] The question is whether you do." [390]

Maren sat. [392] The bench was worn smooth by years of waiting. [402]

"We guide the ferries along this ridge," the woman said. [413] "Not water ferries. [416] Passage ferries. [418] For people crossing from one version of themselves to another." [427]

"That sounds like something my father would have said," Maren whispered. [437]

"He did say it," the man replied, punching another star into the slip. [449] "He sat on this bench forty years ago, a young man who couldn't decide whether to leave the island or stay. [469] We kept his vigil with him through the twilight until he found his answer." [483]

The woman leaned forward. [487] "You've been carrying courage you haven't used, Maren. [496] It's been waiting for you to find where it lives." [506]

Maren felt the urn's weight against her spine. [514] "I don't know how to say goodbye to him." [523]

"You don't say goodbye," the woman said, gently persistent as the tide. [534] "You say what you never said while he was here. [544] That's where the unused courage waits -- in the unsaid things." [554]

The fog shifted, and through a gap in the ridge, Maren saw the sea directly below, moonlight silvering a crescent of sand. [575] The hound sat at the waterline, still as a sentinel, facing the waves. [587]

The man punched one final star and handed her the slip. [598] A constellation of tiny holes caught the lantern light. [607] "Your ferry is the path down to that shore," he said. [618] "We'll keep the vigil here until you've crossed." [627]

Maren took the paper, felt its edges, the small rough circles where the stars had been pressed through. [645] She descended through the heather by a trail that wound gently, indirectly, as if giving her time to gather the words she needed. [668]

At the shore, the hound pressed its head against her knee. [679] She opened the urn. [683] The ashes caught the wind and spread across the water like a whisper finally released, and she said the things she'd stored behind her ribs for years -- love and anger and gratitude and sorrow, all of it, brave and stumbling and true. [722]

Above her, two small lights burned on the ridgeway, steady as stars punched through the dark. [738] The sea sang its lullaby to the shore, and the shore received it, and Maren stood in the space between, no longer waiting. [762]

The leash had broken, and she had followed what it freed. [773]
