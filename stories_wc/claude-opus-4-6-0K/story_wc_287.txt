Maren noticed the last petal at dusk — a single curl of faded pink clinging to the rosebush her mother had planted in the rusted window box the year she died. [30] By the time moonlight flooded the harbor below, the petal had released its hold and spiraled five stories down into the alley where light never reached. [56]

She stood on the fire escape, hands on the railing, watching the harbor glow. [70] The water held the moon the way a cupped palm holds something precious — loosely, knowing it would spill. [88] Fishing boats rocked at their moorings with the rhythm of oars in water, a slow and steady pulse that matched her breathing if she let it. [114]

The rosebush was bare now. [119] Not dead — she was too careful a gardener for that — but stripped of every bloom it had carried through the season. [140] Wistfully pragmatic, Maren had always known this night would come. [150] She had counted the buds in June, watched them open, watched them brown. [163] She had not pretended they would last. [170] But she had hoped, in that quiet way that costs nothing and changes everything, that the final one might hold a little longer. [193]

She reached into the pocket of her canvas apron and turned the small metal object between her fingers: a lockmaster's bitting gauge tooth, worn smooth at its edges. [221] It had belonged to her father, who had spent forty years cutting keys in a shop three blocks from the harbor. [242] He could read a lock the way some people read faces — by the depth of its ridges, the secrets it kept. [263] When he died, Maren kept only this: a single tooth from his gauge, no bigger than a fingernail, precise as a promise. [285]

She held it up to the moonlight. [292] It caught the glow and threw a thin blade of reflected light down into the alley below, illuminating for one instant the cracked concrete, a tuft of moss, the place where the petal had landed. [327]

That was what she wanted. [332] That had always been what she wanted — to reflect light into dark corners. [345] Not grand light, not the flood of noon, but the small, honest kind. [358] The kind her father had carried when he opened a lock for a stranger who'd lost their key. [376] The kind her mother had tucked into soil and seed. [386]

A quivering hush settled over the harbor. [393] The boats stilled. [396] The water went glass-smooth, and the moon's reflection became so sharp it looked like a door you could walk through. [416] Maren felt the silence press against her skin, tender and immense, the way vulnerability feels when you've built just enough shelter to survive it. [440]

She knelt beside the bare rosebush and began to work. [450] From a coffee can she pulled a handful of small mirrors — broken compacts, fragments of chrome, a shard from her father's old shop window — and pressed them into the soil between the roots. [483] She arranged them with care, angling each one so that when moonlight hit the fire escape, the fragments would scatter it downward, outward, into the alley, into the windows of the apartments below where Mrs. Okafor's grandchildren slept, where Danny Chu studied for his citizenship exam by a single lamp. [533]

She worked with the rhythm of oars in water — push, settle, push, settle — her hands steady, her heart keeping its own tidal time. [556] She was not trying to replace the roses. [564] She was too practical for that. [570] But she understood that a garden is not only blossoms. [580] A garden is whatever you tend. [586]

By the time she finished, the fire escape glittered with dozens of small reflections, and the alley below — that narrow canyon of brick and shadow — held points of moonlight like scattered seeds. [618] It was not much. [622] It was enough. [625]

Maren stood and pressed the bitting gauge tooth back into her pocket. [637] She wanted to instill in this place what her parents had instilled in her: the belief that even the smallest precision — a key cut right, a seed planted deep, a mirror angled true — could open something that had seemed permanently shut. [678]

The harbor shimmered. [681] The quivering hush held. [685] And Maren, the fire escape gardener, stood five stories above the dark with her hands in the light, wistfully pragmatic, protected and vulnerable in equal measure, tending what remained. [714]
