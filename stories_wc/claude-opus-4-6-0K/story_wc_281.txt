The light painting studio smelled of ozone and lavender, a combination Maren had never quite gotten used to in the three years since she'd converted the old cannery into her workspace. [32] Long-exposure cameras stood like sentinels around the room, their shutters perpetually open, waiting for her to trace luminous arcs through the dark with her fiber-optic wands. [58] But tonight the cameras were off, and the only light came from the sliver of muscovite geode she held between her thumb and forefinger, its layered mica catching the emergency exit sign's red glow in fractally precise patterns that repeated at every scale, like frozen lightning branching into infinity. [104]

She turned the sliver slowly, watching how light played through its translucent sheets. [117] It had been Jonah's gift, cracked from a geode they'd found together on the coast, back when she still believed his pharmaceutical work was going to change the world. [144]

That was before the recall. [149]

Maren set the sliver on the steel table and pressed her fingertips to her temples, a gesture she caught herself making dozens of times daily now. [175] The telepathy pills — Synaptix, marketed as a "cognitive empathy enhancer" — had been pulled from shelves eleven days ago after patients reported residual effects that wouldn't fade. [202] She'd taken the standard course: four pills over two weeks, prescribed for her chronic difficulty reading social cues. [219] The telepathy had been subtle, nothing like science fiction, more like suddenly understanding the emotional weather of every person in a room. [240] Then the recall notice arrived, and the pills stopped, but the sensitivity didn't. [253]

After the static shock — the term users had coined for the abrupt neurological withdrawal that hit seventy-two hours post-cessation — Maren found herself stranded in a new perceptual country. [281] The empathic channels had collapsed, but something else remained: a heightened awareness of her own body's responses to the world. [302] Every hair rising on her forearm, every flutter in her stomach, every tightness behind her sternum became a signal she couldn't ignore. [322] Somatic markers, Jonah had called them when she'd phoned him in a panic. [335] Your body is still reading what your mind used to translate. [346]

Jonah. [347] She loved him with an affection that coexisted stubbornly alongside her skepticism of everything he represented — the optimistic pharmacologist who believed chemistry could solve loneliness. [370] An affectionate skeptic, he'd once called her, laughing, when she kissed him goodnight and then spent an hour dismantling his latest research paper over tea. [395] She missed that laugh. [399] But she couldn't deny that his framework was the only one making sense of what was happening to her. [416]

So she decided to devise a method. [423]

Standing in the dark studio, she picked up her brightest wand — the blue-white one that left ghost trails on the retina — and opened the shutter on camera three. [451] Then she began to move, not according to any choreography, but according to the somatic markers themselves. [467] When her chest tightened, she swept the wand left. [476] When warmth bloomed in her palms, she drew upward. [485] A prickle along her scalp made her spiral the light in tight, descending loops. [498] She let her body's residual intelligence guide the exposure, translating felt sensation into luminous geometry. [513]

The shutter closed after four minutes. [519] She pulled the image up on the tethered monitor and her breath caught. [532]

The photograph showed pathways — branching, recursive, fractally precise pathways of light that mirrored the mica layers of the muscovite sliver still gleaming on the table. [556] Hidden pathways, drawn not from conscious design but from the body's own cartography of feeling. [570] The image looked like a nervous system, or a river delta, or the inside of a geode split open to reveal its secret architecture. [593]

Maren stared at it with the fragile, translucent hope of willow glass held up to morning light — the kind that could shatter but chose, for now, to hold. [622] She picked up her phone and called Jonah. [630]

"I think the withdrawal isn't damage," she said when he answered. [641] "I think it's a map. [646] The pills opened something, and the shock rearranged it, and now my body knows things my mind hasn't caught up with yet." [668]

A long pause. [671] "That's beautiful," he said, and she could hear his smile without any pill. [684] "And also not peer-reviewed." [689]

"I know," she said, laughing, holding the geode sliver up to the monitor's glow. [703] "Come see the photographs. [707] Help me devise the study. [712] I'll be the skeptic and the subject." [719]

"I'll bring tea," he said. [724]

She hung up and stood in her studio full of invisible light, feeling the hum of her own body like a tuning fork struck once and still ringing, still mapping the dark with its quiet, persistent song. [758]
