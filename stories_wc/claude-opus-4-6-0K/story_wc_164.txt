Maren had always loved the work, even when it broke her heart. [11]

She was a sea-foam recollectionist -- one of the last -- and her days were spent inside the iridescent cave that formed the hollow center of a crystal geode the size of a cathedral. [43] Light moved through the walls in slow prismatic waves. [52] Every surface threw back color. [57] It was beautiful in the way that lonely places often are. [68]

Her task: to gather the memories that washed in with the foam, transliterate the emotions locked inside them into legible script, and catalog what remained before it faded entirely. [97] Sea-foam carried remnants of human feeling -- grief compressed into salt, laughter crystallized in bubbles. [112] Maren could read these. [116] She could take a fistful of dissolving froth and render its sorrow into symbols on crater glass, the dark vitreous sheets formed long ago when something immense struck the earth and melted the sand into permanence. [152]

The crater glass held what foam could not. [160] Emotions transliterated onto its surface stayed -- not as feelings, exactly, but as notation. [173] A language of longing. [177] A grammar of joy. [181] Maren's shelves held thousands of these dark panes, each one a record of someone's interior life. [197]

But lately, she'd noticed missing pieces. [203]

Whole sequences of memory-paths were vanishing from the foam before she could capture them. [217] Not fading the way all memories eventually fade -- disappearing, as if something had plucked them cleanly from the current. [236] Paths that should have connected one emotional event to another simply weren't there. [249] She'd find the grief but not the love that preceded it. [260] She'd find the wonder but not the discovery that sparked it. [271]

This was what kept her up at night, what drove her deeper into conjecture. [285] Why did some paths disappear? [290] Was it entropy, or something more deliberate? [297] She hypothesized. [299] She cross-referenced her crater glass archives. [305] She held fragments up to the geode walls and watched the refracted light reveal nothing she hadn't already seen. [324]

Then the bird came. [328]

It arrived through the narrow fissure at the cave's crown -- a migrating tern, storm-blown and disoriented, trailing salt wind into that cathedral of crystal. [352] It circled the upper chamber twice and was gone, but in its passage it dropped something Maren had never seen inside the geode: seeds. [376] Small, dark, scattered across her workbench like punctuation. [384]

She almost swept them away. [389] But a recollectionist does not discard what arrives uninvited. [398]

She placed one seed on a pane of crater glass and held it to the light. [414] The iridescent walls caught and multiplied the image, and Maren gasped. [425] Threaded through the seed's husk was an emotion she recognized -- a fragment of one of her missing paths. [443] Not just any fragment. [447] The connective tissue. [450] The piece that linked grief to its origin, wonder to its cause. [462]

She tried another seed. [466] Another missing piece. [469]

The migrating bird, she realized, had been carrying them. [478] Not deliberately, perhaps -- birds do not intend the gardens they plant -- but the seeds had traveled through the same atmospheric currents that generated the foam. [503] They had absorbed what the foam had lost. [511] Somewhere along its vast migratory arc, this tern had passed through clouds of evaporated memory and the seeds clinging to its feathers had drunk deep. [536]

Maren laughed, and the sound bounced cheerfully through the gloom of the geode. [549] Of course. [551] Memory didn't simply vanish. [555] It scattered. [557] It took alternate routes, hitched rides on unlikely carriers, lodged itself in the most improbable vessels. [573] The paths hadn't disappeared -- they'd migrated. [579]

She worked quickly now, before the last of the foam dissolved, before the seeds dried and released their cargo to the mineral air. [602] She transliterated each emotion with steady hands, pressing feeling into glass, converting the unreadable into record. [618] Grief found its love. [622] Wonder found its spark. [626] The missing pieces slotted into their sequences with the quiet satisfaction of a lock finally turning. [642]

When she finished, Maren sat surrounded by crater glass panes that told, for the first time, complete stories. [660] The geode light moved through them and cast emotional notation across every crystalline surface -- a library written in color and shadow. [681]

Outside, somewhere above the fissure, the tern was already gone, carrying who-knew-what toward who-knew-where. [697] Other caves. [699] Other recollectionists. [701] Other missing pieces waiting to be found. [708]

Maren smiled in her luminous gloom and began again. [717]
