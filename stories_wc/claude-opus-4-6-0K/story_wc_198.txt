The grotto remembered everything. That was its curse.

Each morning, as dewdrops formed on the crystalline walls, the cave exhaled its memories in ribbons of mist that curled through the prism atrium at its heart. [36] Light fractured there, splitting into quietly vivid spectrums that painted the fog in colors no one had asked to see. [55] And each morning, before the sun climbed high enough to burn the mist away, Delphine came with her saxophone to play the memories back to sleep. [80]

She had been doing this for eleven years. [88]

The grotto sat at the edge of a coastal town that had long since stopped asking questions about the woman who walked into the fog before dawn. [114] They'd learned not to. [118] The old fishermen crossed themselves when they heard the distant saxophone, and the children were told it was only wind through the rocks. [140] But Delphine knew what it was. [146] It was the sound of a prophecy trying to wake. [156]

Her grandmother had spoken it first, in the final delirium before death, words tumbling out in a code that sounded like lullaby and tasted like dread. [180] Numbers nested inside nursery rhymes. [186] Dates disguised as colors. [190] A map of catastrophe folded into song. [197] Delphine had been seventeen, holding the old woman's hand, and she'd understood every syllable with a clarity that felt like a wound opening. [219]

The prophecy wanted to be heard. [225] That was its nature. [230] It pushed outward through cracks in silence, through the negative space between spoken words, through the gaps where conversation paused and breath hung unfinished. [253] It lived in what was not said, growing louder in every quiet room. [265] Delphine had learned this the hard way, when fragments of the coded language began surfacing in the mouths of strangers, in the spaces between their sentences, in the half-seconds before they chose different words. [297] A shopkeeper almost said a date. [303] A child nearly hummed the melody. [309] Each time, the prophecy inched closer to completion, closer to the thing her grandmother had warned would happen if all its pieces were ever assembled aloud in a single place. [339]

So Delphine had invested herself in silence. [346] She wore it like a vestment, a vested hush that she carried into the grotto each morning and reinforced with her instrument. [367] The saxophone was not for making music. [374] It was for unmaking it. [379]

She played in the negative space between notes, her breath shaping the silences rather than the sounds, each phrase a careful erasure. [400] Where the prophecy tried to crystallize in the mist, she dissolved it. [412] Where coded syllables began to form in the dripping water, she covered them with long, aching tones that meant nothing, that carried no information, that were beautiful and empty as grief. [443]

This morning, the mist was thicker than she'd ever seen. [454] The prism atrium blazed even in near-darkness, refracting the faintest starlight into impossible auroras that swam through the fog. [472] Delphine felt the prophecy pressing hard against the membrane of the world, straining toward utterance. [486] Something had changed. [489] Someone, somewhere, had whispered a fragment they shouldn't have known. [499]

She lifted the saxophone and began. [505]

The grotto answered. [508] Echoes returned her notes twisted, and beneath them she heard her grandmother's voice, distant and mechanical, reciting the coded verses with terrible patience. [530] The walls wept condensation that pooled into shapes resembling numbers. [540] The mist thickened until Delphine could not see her own hands on the keys. [553]

She played harder, not louder. [558] She widened the silences between notes until they swallowed whole phrases of the prophecy. [572] She breathed into the horn and let the breath carry nothing, a warm void that expanded through the atrium and pressed the fractured light back into white. [598]

Slowly, the grotto's voice diminished. [603] The coded words dissolved into simple water, running harmlessly down stone. [613] The prism dimmed to ordinary crystal. [619] The mist began to thin as the first true light of morning touched the cave's mouth, and Delphine stood in the fading fog, trembling, the saxophone warm against her chest. [649]

She whispered to the grotto the only words she allowed herself each morning, the same three words her grandmother had spoken last, the ones that weren't code, that were simply true. [682]

"Not yet. Rest." [685]

The dewdrops caught the new sun. [691] The grotto settled into stone silence, its memories banked for another day. [703] Delphine walked home through the brightening world, past fishermen who would not meet her eyes, carrying her instrument and her inheritance, the quiet weight of a catastrophe still sleeping, still hushed, still hers to keep unspoken for one more morning. [741]
