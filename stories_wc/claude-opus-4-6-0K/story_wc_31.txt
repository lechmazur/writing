Eamon lit the last lamp on the north arm of the pier and stood watching the harbor, where the hull of the Celestine lay half-submerged against the breakwater, her stern still visible at low tide like a jaw unwilling to finish its sentence. [40]

He had worked the late shift for eleven years, long enough that the other lamplighters called him permanent dusk. [57] They asked why he never transferred to mornings, and he told them the truth: he preferred the silence. [73] This was honest, and it concealed everything. [80] Eamon had learned early that you could hide behind truth the way other people hid behind lies, letting the facts form a wall so complete that no one thought to look past it. [107]

Tonight the town was releasing sky lanterns for the solstice. [117] Already the first paper shells were lifting from the plaza beyond the seawall, ascending in trembling columns of amber and rose. [134] Hundreds more would follow. [138] The sky would fill with drifting fire, and the whole harbor would go quiet the way it does when something enormous and gentle passes overhead, a silence like the hush after a meteor splits the dark. [170]

He reached into his coat and closed his fingers around the brass tag. [183] Room 12, it read, stamped beneath the name of a hotel that no longer existed. [197] A skeleton key tag, tarnished green at the edges, attached to nothing. [208] Margery had kept it on her nightstand for twenty years, a souvenir from the coast where they had spoken their vows by lantern light, promises so tangled with brightness that he came to think of them as luminous, as though the words themselves had been a kind of burning. [250]

She had been the one who heard color. [258] A car horn was burnt orange. [264] Rain on a window was silver-violet. [270] She spent her life trying to map these correspondences, filling notebooks with swatches and frequencies, insisting that if she could only find the right text, the right framework, she could prove that sound had a visible spectrum all its own. [305] Before she died she told him about a book she had read as a girl, a treatise on acoustic chromatism, found in the oddest place: a forgotten library inside the Celestine, the merchant vessel that sank against the breakwater in 1923. [343] She said the book had changed her, had given her the language to describe what she already knew. [360] She said she had never been able to find it again. [371]

So Eamon made his vow. [376] Not at the hospital, where the words would have felt clinical, but here on the pier, speaking into the lamp flame the way he had spoken into the lantern glow on their wedding night. [405] He promised he would find the color of sound. [414]

He descended the maintenance ladder at the pier's edge, boots finding the Celestine's exposed deck. [427] The tide was obligingly low. [432] He switched on his lamp and entered the companionway, which led down into the ship's belly where seawater had long since retreated from the upper cabins, leaving brine stains and barnacle lace. [460] The library was smaller than he expected, a room of warped shelves and swollen spines, smelling of salt and old paper. [479] He moved through it by wandering purposefully, the way Margery used to browse, letting instinct guide his path while his eyes remained sharp. [500]

Through the porthole, the sky lanterns were now a river of light. [512] Their glow entered the cabin in shifting bands, painting the book spines gold, then rose, then the deep amber of a sustained cello note, and Eamon stopped breathing because he understood suddenly that this was it, this was what she meant. [549] The lanterns were silent, but the light they cast seemed to hum. [561] He could almost hear the color, or see the sound, the boundary dissolving the way Margery always said it did. [578]

His hand found a slim volume wedged between two ruined atlases. [589] The cover was illegible, but inside, hand-drawn spectral charts mapped tones to hues in Margery's own remembered language. [605] He pressed the skeleton key tag between its pages to signify that the vow was kept, that the circuit was closed, luminous promise meeting luminous proof. [630]

Above him the lanterns rose higher, and the harbor held its breath, and Eamon sat on the floor of a drowned library with a book in his lap and wept in a color he could finally name. [665]
