The lore keeper had always believed that history was not buried beneath the earth but beneath surfaces we stopped looking at. [22]

Her name was Sable, and she carried the accumulated myths of seven fallen dynasties in a neural archive threaded along her spine, each data-filament humming with stories older than the steel cities that had replaced the kingdoms they described. [55] Tonight she stood at the edge of the kaleidoscopic waterfall, its cascade refracting bioluminescent minerals into ribbons of shifting color that painted the cliff face in perpetual aurora. [80] Behind that curtain of light lay the hidden orchard, the last place mentioned in the Ascension Codex before its final entry dissolved into cipher. [101]

She had until sunrise. [105] After dawn, the orbital array would complete its survey sweep of this valley, and the Consortium would know she had gone off-charter. [127] They would revoke her keeper's license, seize the archive in her spine, and the location of the stairway of ascension would be lost again, perhaps permanently. [153]

Sable was wisely adventurous, a phrase her mentor had coined to describe someone who leaped only after studying the distance. [172] She had studied this distance for eleven years. [180] She pulled her thermoweave hood tight, took a breath that tasted of ozone and ancient pollen, and made her sally through the waterfall. [201]

The cold hit her like a slap of centuries. [210] Then she was through, standing in the orchard. [219]

The trees were impossibly old, their trunks wrapped in synthetic bark grafts that some long-dead caretaker had applied to keep them alive. [240] Fruits she could not name hung in clusters, glowing faintly, as though each one remembered a sun that no longer existed. [260] Between the trees stood walls, remnants of a chapel or throne room, their surfaces layered in millennia of paint, each era covering the last like a palimpsest of power. [289]

The unclaimed throne. [292] Every dynasty in Sable's archive had referenced it: the seat no ruler had ever legitimately held because no ruler had ever found it. [314] The Codex said the throne was not an object but a destination, reachable only via the stairway of ascension, and the stairway's location was encoded in murals that predated all seven dynasties. [347] Murals that had been painted over, again and again, by successors who feared what the images revealed. [363]

Sable knelt beside the nearest wall and activated the micro-abrasion tool on her wrist gauntlet. [377] Through the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals, she began to read a story older than her archive. [394] The first layer to come away was Consortium grey, utilitarian and bland. [405] Beneath it, the vermilion calligraphy of the Jade Hegemony. [414] Beneath that, the silver leaf of the Orbital Ascendancy. [423] Layer after layer she peeled, each one a civilization's attempt to claim the wall and silence what lay underneath. [441]

An hour before sunrise, she reached the original surface. [450]

The mural blazed with pigments that still held their luminance after millennia, depicting a staircase spiraling upward through an orchard of crystal trees. [472] At the top of the staircase sat a throne, empty, surrounded by light. [484] And embedded in the wall at the mural's center, pressed into the ancient plaster like a seal, was a ruby flake, no larger than her thumbnail, catching the glow of the bioluminescent fruit above. [515]

Sable's breath caught. [518] The Codex's final cipher had described a key the color of first fire. [531] She eased the ruby flake free with trembling fingers. [540] The moment it left the wall, a seam of light split the ground between two of the oldest trees, and stone steps materialized, descending first, then curving upward, spiraling exactly as the mural depicted. [572]

The stairway of ascension. [576]

She looked back through the waterfall, where the sky was beginning to pale. [589] The orbital array would wake soon. [595] The Consortium would come with their surveys and their erasure. [605] They would paint over the mural again, seal the orchard, classify the waterfall as a mineral resource. [620]

But Sable was already on the stairs, the ruby flake warm against her palm, the archive in her spine singing with recognition. [641] She was not climbing toward a throne to claim it. [651] She was climbing to ensure its story survived, because that was what lore keepers did: they carried what others tried to bury. [672]

Above her the steps wound upward into a light that felt like memory, like the future remembering the past and finding it beautiful. [694] She climbed until the sunrise caught her from behind, and by then she was beyond the reach of any survey, any erasure, any dynasty yet to come. [722]

The throne remained unclaimed. [726] But it was no longer unknown. [732]
