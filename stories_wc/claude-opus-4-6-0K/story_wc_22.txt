The reef died on a Tuesday, though no one marked the date. [12]

Harmon had driven coaches up and down Gloom Hill for thirty years, ferrying the living past the dead, past the old battlefield where bones still surfaced after heavy rain. [42] Now the coaches no longer came, because the road had cracked, because the town had emptied, because the reef that once broke the waves had bleached and crumbled, letting the sea chew the coastline into something unrecognizable. [73] After the reef dies, the jetty is next -- everyone knew that. [84] But the jetty refused. [88]

Instead, it bloomed. [91]

Salt-stunted vines threaded through the pilings. [98] Sea lavender erupted from crevices in the concrete. [107] Purslane spread in dense mats over the rotting planks, and at twilight the whole structure glowed violet and green, a narrow corridor of life jutting into a vastness of gray water. [138] Harmon came to the blooming jetty every evening now, his coat pockets heavy with dried seed pods he had collected over decades -- redbud, milkweed, evening primrose, wild indigo -- each one labeled in a language no living person spoke. [173]

He spoke dead languages the way other men spoke to dogs: naturally, without embarrassment, as though the words had simply chosen him. [196] Sumerian for the roses. [200] Akkadian for the grasses. [204] He murmured in Hittite when he split the pods and shook seeds into his palm, and he believed -- had always believed -- that the old tongues carried agreements the modern world had forgotten. [235] Submerged concords. [237] Pacts between soil and root, between rain and stone, made long before anyone thought to write them down and then written down anyway, in languages that eventually went quiet. [263]

He wanted to wake those pacts again. [270]

The battlefield sprawled behind the town, a hectare of hardpan where nothing grew because the earth remembered violence. [288] Harmon had lost his grandfather there, and his grandfather's horse, and some version of the future that might have included gentleness. [308] For years he had tried to fertilize that ground -- compost, manure, phosphate rock -- and for years the soil had refused, calcium-locked and bitter. [332] The seeds he planted rotted or were taken by crows. [342]

Then he began listening to the birds. [349]

It started accidentally. [352] A whimbrel on the jetty repeated a descending call seven times, and Harmon, who had been reading a Sumerian agricultural tablet the night before, recognized the interval -- the same tonal pattern used in temple hymns about flooding fields. [385] He followed the whimbrel's direction, found a tidal pool where decomposed seaweed had formed a black, mineral-rich paste. [403] He carried buckets of it to the battlefield. [411]

By understanding bird calls, he learned where the jetty's ecosystem was producing what the battlefield needed. [427] Terns led him to fish carcasses rich in nitrogen. [436] Sparrows guided him to patches of mycorrhizal fungi hidden under driftwood. [447] The oystercatchers, with their sharp orange bills and sharper cries, showed him which rocks held phosphorus-dense algae. [463] Each call was a coordinate, a sentence in a language older than Sumerian, and Harmon translated it with the patience of a man who had spent his life driving the same hill and knowing every rut. [497]

He carried the jetty's gifts to the battlefield in the same leather satchel he had once used for coach schedules. [517] He mixed them with the dried seed pods, crumbling the husks between his fingers while whispering in Elamite, in Proto-Sinaitic, in tongues so old they tasted like iron. [546] He pressed the mixture into the hardpan at dusk, when the light was the color of bruised fruit and the jetty behind him pulsed with its impossible garden. [574]

Narrow vastness -- that was the feeling. [581] Standing on a thin line of wood above an infinite sea, planting seeds in a field that stretched to the horizon, believing that smallness and enormity were the same thing if you held still long enough. [614]

By autumn, the first shoots appeared on the battlefield. [624] Evening primrose, pale and defiant. [629] Then milkweed, its pods already forming, already preparing to split and scatter. [641] Harmon knelt among them, an old coachman with dirt-black hands and no passengers, and spoke to the sprouts in a language that had been dead for four thousand years. [671]

The sprouts did not answer, but they grew. [680]

The jetty bloomed. [683] The battlefield softened. [686] The reef stayed dead, and the sea kept coming, and Harmon kept carrying life from one narrow place to another, as though he were still driving his coach, as though the hill still had a destination, as though the ancient agreement between growing things and grieving earth had never been broken, only submerged, only waiting for someone patient enough to dig it out. [744]

He would let the garden reclaim what war had taken. [754] One dead language, one bird call, one seed pod at a time. [766]
