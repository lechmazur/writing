The alchemist's market hung between heaven and the streets like a dream the city refused to wake from, strung on cables and catwalks high above the rooftops where chimney smoke curled into the stalls selling tinctures of forgotten languages and powdered twilight. [43] Maren moved through it the way she moved through everything—half here, half somewhere else—which was, after all, her profession. [62] She was a between-worlds translator, one of the few who could read the layered meanings that bled through from adjacent realities and render them into something the merchants and mystics of this world could use. [92]

Today she carried a lighthouse lens fragment in her coat pocket, wrapped in silk the color of old bone. [111] It was elusively tangible, the kind of object that felt solid when you weren't thinking about it and seemed to waver at the edges when you looked directly. [138] She'd found it seventeen years ago, when she was nine, in a painting hanging in her grandmother's kitchen—not found it depicted there, but found it actually lodged behind the canvas, as though the painting had been keeping it safe. [173]

That discovery had been her first anchor of intuition, the moment when she understood that the world contained hidden channels, and that she could feel them the way other people felt changes in weather. [204] Her grandmother had been a translator too, though no one called it that then. [218] They called her eccentric, or difficult, or worse. [227] She had spent her life documenting the histories that slipped between the cracks—the alchemists expelled from guilds, the rooftop markets that appeared on no official map, the women who kept knowledge alive in paint and pigment when the libraries burned. [262]

Maren's grandmother had encoded those histories through hidden details in paintings: a symbol in the grain of a wooden table, a name stitched into a curtain's pattern, coordinates disguised as cracks in plaster walls. [296] After she died, the paintings scattered into private collections and curiosity shops across the city. [312] Between childhood and now, Maren had tracked down thirty-seven of them. [323] Each one she translated. [326] Each one she archived. [329] Today she was here for the thirty-eighth. [337]

The stall belonged to a woman named Oxanna who sold pigments ground from stones that no longer existed in nature. [357] Behind her workbench, half-hidden by jars of cobalt and cinnabar, hung a small oil painting of a lighthouse on a shore that Maren recognized from no geography but knew in her bones. [392]

"That one's not for sale," Oxanna said without looking up. [402]

"I know," Maren replied. [406] "I'm not here to buy it. I'm here to read it." [417]

Oxanna's hands stilled over her mortar and pestle. [425] "You're Vessel's granddaughter." [428]

Maren nodded. [430] The name her grandmother had used in these circles, a name that itself had been overlooked by history. [448]

Oxanna stepped aside. [451]

Maren approached the painting and let her intuition anchor her, that deep-body knowing that preceded thought. [466] The lighthouse lens in the painting matched the fragment in her pocket—the same prismatic geometry, the same fracture line. [484] She pressed the fragment against the canvas and felt the worlds thin. [496]

There, in the brushstrokes of the lighthouse beam, her grandmother had painted names—forty-three names of alchemists who had built this very market in the sky a century ago, whose contributions had been attributed to their masters or simply erased. [535] The lens fragment resonated against the paint, and the names became luminous, readable, real. [550]

Maren began to unfasten the painting from the wall, carefully, reverently, the way you would lift a sleeping child. [569] Oxanna watched but did not stop her. [577]

"She told me someone would come for it eventually," Oxanna said. [588] "She said you'd know which piece to bring." [597]

Maren held the painting against her chest, the lighthouse lens fragment warm in her pocket like a second heartbeat. [615] The market swayed gently above the rooftops, lanterns catching in the wind, and for a moment everything existed in suspension—the past and the present, the known and the hidden, the grandmother and the granddaughter, held together in an eternal instant where nothing was lost, only waiting to be found. [664]

She would take the painting to her archive. [673] She would publish the names. [678] She would make the world remember what it had tried so hard to forget, and in doing so she would honor not just the forty-three alchemists but every overlooked history that had ever been painted into silence, waiting for someone with the right fragment, the right intuition, the right love to come along and translate it back into the light. [738]

Above her, the market creaked and glittered, ancient and temporary and alive, strung between the sky and the city like a sentence between two languages, waiting—as it always had—to be understood. [772]
