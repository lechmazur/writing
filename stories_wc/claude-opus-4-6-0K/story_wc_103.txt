The living bridge garden had no architect anyone could name, though Elara Voss had spent eleven years trying to claim it. [22] Its root-woven spans of ficus and rubber tree stretched across ravines thick with mist, each bridge grown rather than built, each pathway a collaboration between human patience and arboreal will. [49] She had designed hedge mazes across four continents, sculpting boxwood and yew into labyrinths that could swallow an afternoon, but this garden swallowed something deeper. [73] It swallowed memory. [76]

She first noticed it in the photographs. [83] Every image she took within the garden's boundaries emerged paler than the last, as though the light itself was being slowly digested. [104] A snapshot from her first visit, eleven years ago, showed vivid emerald canopies and the terracotta smear of soil beneath her boots. [124] By the fifth year, the same scene re-photographed showed only gauze-white shapes, the trees reduced to whispers of contrast. [142] The fading was not in her camera or her film. [152] Prints she had made years earlier were dissolving too, pigment lifting from paper like breath leaving a body. [169]

She should have stopped visiting. [174] Instead, she came more often, driven by the need to discover the texture of time, to understand whether the garden consumed her images because it was alive in a direction she could not yet perceive. [207] Her hedge mazes had always been spatial puzzles, but this place posed a temporal one. [222] She felt it in the way the roots rearranged overnight, bridges curving into geometries that should not have fit the ravine's dimensions. [241] Through hyperbolic geometry, she realized, the garden was folding. [250] Saddle-curved surfaces nested inside its canopy, warping distance so that two points a meter apart by foot required hours to traverse. [270] The bridges did not merely cross space; they pleated it. [280]

And she was becoming pleated with it. [287]

Retrocognitively trapped -- that was the term she scrawled in her journal the morning she woke knowing the exact weight of rain that had fallen on the garden in 1953, decades before her birth. [318] She could feel the grain of historical moments, Tuesdays heavier than Wednesdays, autumn mornings textured like raw silk. [336] The garden was feeding her its past while draining her present from every photograph, every record, every proof that she existed now. [356]

Deep in the oldest bridge, where roots had fused into a cathedral arch above a ravine so deep its bottom was theoretical, she found the halo fragment. [381] It was no larger than a crescent of fingernail, translucent, humming at a frequency she heard in her sternum. [399] Not angelic. [401] Astronomical. [402] A shard of the ring structure that once encircled something vast, something the garden had grown around like scar tissue around a splinter. [422]

She held it to the fading photograph of her first visit, and the image convulsed. [436] Color hemorrhaged back, violent greens and reds flooding paper that had been nearly blank. [449] But behind her in the restored image stood a figure she had never seen -- herself, older, root-threaded, eyes white as exposed film. [471] The future self mouthed a single word she could not read. [482]

Elara understood then. [485] The garden was not consuming her photographs out of hunger. [494] It was trying to disintegrate the boundary between her moments, to collapse past and future into a single navigable present. [513] Every faded image was a wall thinned. [520] Every lost pigment was a door opened. [527]

She pressed the halo fragment against the bridge's living wood, and hyperbolic space unfurled around her like a flower made of corridors. [548] She could see the garden in every era simultaneously, bridges growing and dying and growing again, ravines filling with centuries of leaf fall and emptying in geological exhalations. [574] The texture of time was not smooth. [581] It was fibrous, knotted, alive as root. [588]

Her hands trembled, and the quaking reverie that overtook her was not fear but recognition. [603] She had designed labyrinths her whole life to trap others in beautiful confusion. [615] Now the garden had designed one to trap her, and she was grateful. [627]

She set down her camera. [632] The photographs would keep fading, and she would keep remembering in directions no lens could follow. [648] The halo fragment pulsed once, warm, then cooled into the bark as though it had always been there. [666] Perhaps it had. [669] Perhaps she had. [672]

The bridges grew on, patient and impossible, and Elara Voss walked deeper into a time that had no edges, only roots. [694]
