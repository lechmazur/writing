Luma had not laughed in seven months, and she kept count the way other people kept scars — privately, pressing the number like a bruise to see if it still hurt. [30]

It still hurt. [33]

She walked the Orchard District anyway, where centuries of thick fog had swallowed the old fruit trees and left only their calcified stumps jutting from the ground like broken teeth. [60] No one came here anymore. [64] The fog was not weather; it was memory made visible, the exhalation of a neighborhood that had once been vibrant and was now lost to itself. [87] Somewhere beneath the mist, crumbling walls still held the ghosts of her early work — murals she had painted before grief had locked her hands into fists. [113]

Luma was a mural artist, had been since she was sixteen, famous in the small way that mattered: people recognized her colors before they recognized her face. [139] She painted not with pigment alone but with light, layering phosphorescent compounds into her plaster so that her frescoes glowed at dusk, shifting hue as the sun traveled. [166] Critics called her technique "exposed film," because each mural recorded the angle and intensity of every day's light the way a photograph records a single instant, building a luminous archive of time. [195] Her walls remembered what people forgot. [201]

She had stopped painting the day her mother died. [210]

Now she moved through the fog like a woman inside a daydream, and perhaps she was — the boundary between waking and reverie had grown soft in this place, time folding over itself so that seven months felt simultaneous with seven minutes. [248] Within the fold of that daydream, she stumbled. [256]

Her boot struck something hard. [261] She knelt and brushed away damp soil to reveal a fresco fragment, roughly the size of a dinner plate, broken from a wall she did not immediately recognize. [288] She turned it over. [292]

The pigment still glowed. [296] Faint gold, breathing amber at the edges — her mother's favorite palette. [307] Luma realized with a start that this was a piece of her very first mural, the one she had painted on the old cider house wall when she was sixteen, her mother holding the lamp, both of them laughing at the absurdity of painting in fog so thick you could only see six inches ahead. [358]

She had forgotten that laughter. [363] The fragment brought it back the way a shard of mirror can return an entire room. [378]

Luma sat in the ruined orchard and let the memory display itself fully, not just the image but the feeling, the warmth of her mother's voice saying, "You are painting with light, little moth, and the fog is your canvas." [415]

She traced the glowing surface with her thumb and felt something unlock. [427] Not a door — more like a network, a knowledge network of connected moments: the cider house mural leading to the courtyard triptych, leading to the bridge series, leading to every wall she had ever touched, each one a node of joy she had believed was lost. [469] The connections lit up inside her the way her frescoes lit up at dusk, one triggering the next, a chain reaction of remembered happiness. [493]

She laughed. [495]

It was a small laugh, pensive, weighted with everything she had carried, but it was real and it tasted like cider and fog and phosphorescent gold. [521] Pensive mirth — the particular flavor of joy that has passed through sorrow and come out luminous on the other side. [540]

Luma stood. [542] She placed the fresco fragment carefully in her satchel, not as a relic but as a seed. [558] She would carry it back to the studio and let it teach her hands to open again. [575] She would return to the Orchard District with her phosphorescent plaster and her brushes, and she would paint these ruined walls until they glowed, until the fog itself became a gallery, until anyone who wandered here could stumble as she had stumbled and find something bright underfoot. [619]

The fog would remain — she had no illusions about banishing centuries of loss. [632] But light could exist inside fog. [638] Her mother had known that. [643] Her murals had always known that. [649]

She walked home slowly, the daydream folding closed behind her like a letter she would reread many times. [667] In her satchel the fragment pulsed its quiet gold. [676] In her chest, the counter reset. [682]

Zero months since she had last laughed. [689]

And counting up this time, not down. [696]
