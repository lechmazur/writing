Maret had been called many things during the reconstruction -- healer, heretic, grandmother of the revolt -- but the title she preferred was the one the sulfur lilies whispered to her at dawn: keeper of what grows. [35]

She hadn't asked for the telepathy. [41] It arrived the morning after the ceasefire, when she knelt beside the hot springs to wash ash from her grandchildren's clothes and a fiddlehead fern uncurled against her wrist, pressing a single clear thought into her mind: We remember what you've forgotten. [73] After that, every root system near the volcanic vents spoke to her in slow, mineral-rich sentences, and she listened, because listening was the only insurgency left that mattered. [97]

The Conclave elders had already resumed the old ceremonies. [106] Every generation, an embryo preserved in amber was brought to the central spring, and the high priest would unseal it in the superheated water, releasing the genetic instruction contained within -- a destiny, implanted into the firstborn child of the chosen family. [143] For six hundred years, the amber embryos had dictated who would lead, who would farm, who would fight. [160] The tradition had kept their valley stable, the elders argued. [170] Maret argued it had kept the valley asleep, and sleepwalkers had marched them straight into a war that broke the world in half. [193]

She did not want to destroy the tradition. [201] She wanted to evolve it with intent, to crack it open and let new air inside the way the hot springs cracked open stone to reveal veins of crystal. [230] But the unsealing ritual required knowledge the Conclave hoarded: a specific sequence of invocations that softened the amber without killing the embryo inside. [254] Without that sequence, she could only watch another child receive a destiny chosen six centuries ago by people who never imagined reconstruction, never imagined grandmothers with insurgent hearts. [280]

Then her youngest granddaughter, Pell, dragged an abandoned kite home from the obsidian ridge. [293] Its frame was charred, its silk half-dissolved by acid rain, but its tail -- a long ribbon of treated hide -- was covered in cryptic script that Maret did not recognize. [322] She pinned the ribbon across her kitchen wall and studied it for three days, brushing her fingers over angular glyphs that resembled no alphabet the Conclave taught. [349]

On the fourth morning, the moss growing along the window ledge murmured to her: That is root-language. [365] Old. [366] Older than the elders. [370]

Maret pressed her palm flat against the stone wall where colonies of thermophilic lichen thrived on geothermal warmth, and she asked them to translate. [393] The lichen were slow thinkers but precise, and over the next two weeks they decoded the kite-tail script symbol by symbol, feeding each meaning into her mind like nutrients through mycelium. [422]

What emerged was not merely the unsealing invocation. [431] It was the original framework -- the one written before the Conclave edited it to serve their power. [447] The ancient script described a ceremony of offering, not imposition. [457] The embryo in amber was never meant to dictate a child's destiny. [469] It was meant to be unsealed in the communal spring so its genetic wisdom would dissolve into the water and be available to everyone -- a shared inheritance, not a leash. [499]

Maret brought the decoded ribbon to the next ceremony. [509] Steam veiled the central spring. [514] The current high priest held the amber above the water, preparing the old words. [526] Maret stepped forward, and the crowd murmured, because insurgent grandmothers were still feared even during reconstruction. [540]

She did not shout. [544] She read the original text aloud, her voice carrying across the mineral pools, and when she reached the final glyph, she took the amber from the priest's startled hands and lowered it into the water herself. [578]

The amber did not crack the way it did in Conclave ceremonies. [590] It dissolved. [592] The embryo's ancient genetic material spiraled outward in luminous threads, spreading through every connected spring in the valley. [608] Pell, standing ankle-deep at the edge, gasped as warmth flooded through her -- not a command, but a vast library of possibility opening its doors. [633]

Around the springs, the sulfur lilies sang. [641] Maret felt their joy vibrate through her bones, and she understood that this was what tradition meant when it was honest: not a cage shaped like a gift, but a seed offered to open ground. [675]

She looked at Pell, at all the children standing wide-eyed in the steam, and she saw futures branching like root systems -- unpredictable, entangled, alive. [699] No destiny implanted. [702] Only potential, unsealed at last, dissolving into the world where it belonged. [713]

The reconstruction, Maret decided, could finally begin for real. [723]
