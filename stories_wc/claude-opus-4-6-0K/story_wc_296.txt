The magic trick failed at sundown, and the cursed lake answered with hunger.

Maren had promised the village she could seal the vortex. [24] She had stood at the water's edge with her staff raised, speaking the old words, drawing silver sigils that were supposed to collapse the swirling orchard at the lake's heart back into stillness. [53] Instead, the sigils shattered like glass against stone, and the vortex widened, its rotation pulling another ring of apple trees from the shore into its slow, grinding carousel. [78] Now the orchard spun faster, bark groaning, roots dragging through black water, and Maren stood knee-deep in the shallows with the taste of failure thick on her tongue. [105]

She was a guarded druid, had been one for twenty-three years. [116] Guarded not because she feared the world but because the world had taught her what openness cost. [132] She kept her grief folded tight beneath her ribs, her losses catalogued but never spoken. [147] This was her attribute, the thing the villages whispered about when they sent for her: Maren finds lost things. [164] Lost cattle, lost children, lost wells swallowed by landslides. [173] She found them through expanding circles, walking outward from the last known point in widening spirals until the land whispered its confession to her feet. [196] She had never failed to find what was missing. [205]

But the vortex was not a lost thing. [212] It was a wound, and wounds require a different medicine. [222]

She waded deeper. [225] The water climbed her thighs, cold as accusation. [233] Around her the orchard trees churned in their vast, slow wheel, trunks bending and straightening as the current took them, branches clawing the violet sky. [256] Between the roots she saw pale fruit bobbing, apples that had fermented in cursed water until their flesh glowed faintly, phosphorescent and wrong. [277] At the center of the vortex, where the spin was fastest, the water dropped into a dark funnel, and from that funnel rose a sound like a voice trying to remember how to speak. [310]

Maren reached into her belt pouch and found the flesh-eating plant seed she had carried for six years. [328] She had taken it from a ruin in the southern marshes, a temple whose priests had bred carnivorous vines to guard their altars. [351] The seed was the size of a walnut, ridged, warm even now against her palm. [365] She had kept it because she understood hunger as a force that could be directed, and because she had always known a day would come when only appetite could answer appetite. [395]

She closed her eyes. [399] The warlike serenity she had cultivated since girlhood settled over her like armor made of breath. [414] Battle was not frenzy; battle was the quiet certainty that you would move correctly because you had already accepted every possible cost. [434]

She began to walk her expanding circles, but inward this time, spiraling toward the vortex's throat. [449] With each ring she called out a truth she had never spoken. [461] This was the method: frozen confessions, things locked inside her for decades, now released to feed the seed. [478] She spoke her mother's name and the manner of her dying. [489] She spoke the child she had not saved in the flooded valley. [501] She spoke the love she had buried without ceremony. [510] Each confession hit the water and the seed pulsed brighter, cracking along its ridges, beginning to germinate in her fist. [529]

She wanted to discover what mirrors don't show, the shape behind the reflection, the grief that hides in the angle where the glass meets the frame. [555] The vortex was a mirror, she understood now. [563] The cursed lake reflected only surfaces, and beneath the surface it hoarded every sorrow the surrounding lands had ever shed into its tributaries. [584]

At the center, waist-deep, she thrust the sprouting seed into the funnel. [596] Vines erupted, thick and barbed, driving downward into the wound, feeding on the accumulated sorrow, consuming it. [612] The vortex shuddered. [615] Trees groaned and began to unbend, their tortured trunks straightening as the current released them, roots finding purchase in the lakebed once more. [637] The spinning slowed. [640] Apple trees stood again in rows, dripping, battered, but rooted. [650]

The carnivorous vine sealed the funnel shut and went dormant, sated. [661]

Maren stood in the stillness, water lapping gently at her waist, the orchard around her no longer swirling but simply standing in the lake like a congregation after prayer. [691] She had found the lost thing after all. [699] It had been inside her chest the whole time, frozen, waiting to be spoken. [713] She breathed out the last of her confessions, a single word she gave only to the water, and the lake, no longer cursed, accepted it without judgment. [741]

She walked her circles outward now, back toward shore, back toward the world that would ask her how she did it. [762] She would not say. [766]
