Maren was the island's reality checker, a title that sounded more certain than the work itself. [16] Her job was to walk the line between what the island insisted was true and what could be verified -- an empirically whimsical practice, as her predecessor had called it, requiring equal parts measurement and faith. [50]

The ancient ridge was in bloom. [56] That much she could confirm. [61] Every seven years the knowledge fruit trees flowered along the volcanic spine of Ilara, their blossoms impossibly luminous -- white petals edged in a light that seemed to come from inside the color spectrum rather than from any sun. [96] Each blossom would become a fruit, and each fruit held a seed, and each seed carried within it a fragment of collective memory: the stories, songs, recipes, warnings, and whispered histories of every generation that had tended these trees. [132]

The monsoon was coming. [136] That she could also confirm. [141] Three weeks, perhaps less, before the rains would strip the blossoms, drown the ridge, and wash the unharvested seeds into the volcanic channels where no one could retrieve them. [168] When knowledge fruit seeds were lost, the memories inside them did not simply vanish -- they thinned. [183] People would wake one morning unable to recall the melody of a lullaby. [194] A grandmother would forget which herbs cured fever. [202] A fisherman would lose the name of the current his father taught him to read. [215]

This was why reality checkers existed -- not to debunk the island's magic, but to protect cultural memory by distinguishing which phenomena demanded action and which were merely beautiful. [243]

Maren climbed the ridge at dawn, her notebook full of dream transcriptions gathered from the village overnight. [258] This was her method: through interpreted dreams, she could determine which seeds were ready, which trees were calling, and which memories were most at risk of dissolution. [284] The islanders dreamed collectively -- another fact she had verified empirically, cross-referencing symbols and images across dozens of sleepers. [300] When the baker dreamed of a river running backward and the schoolteacher dreamed the same river on the same night, Maren marked it. [321] When children who had never met described identical birds in their sleep, she cataloged the species. [336]

Last night, fourteen people had dreamed of silence. [344] Not quiet -- silence. [347] The absolute absence of sound, described in remarkably consistent terms. [356] Maren sat among the flowering trees and felt the weight of that data. [367]

Silence meant forgetting. [370] Silence meant a memory was dying. [376]

She opened the earliest fruit she could find, still green and resistant beneath its glowing skin. [391] Inside, the seed was pale, dormant. [397] She held it to her ear the way her predecessor had taught her, feeling foolish and reverent in equal measure -- the luminous doubt that was her constant companion in this work. [426] Was she a scientist or a priestess? [433] The island never clarified. [437]

She needed to waken this seed before the monsoon arrived. [447] If the memory inside it surfaced, she could transcribe it, anchor it in written form, give it a second vessel beyond the biological. [469] But seeds woke only when their memory was recognized, named, called back by someone who understood what they carried. [486]

She returned to her dream notes. [492] The silence in fourteen dreams. [497] The river running backward. [501] A bird no one could name. [507]

Then she found it -- old Tekua's dream, nearly overlooked. [516] He had dreamed of his mother singing, but the song had no sound. [528] He woke weeping, unable to remember the words. [536]

Maren pressed the seed between her palms. [543] "You carry a song," she said. [549]

The seed warmed. [552] Its pale surface flushed green, then gold. [559] She felt it hum -- not heard, felt -- a vibration that traveled through her bones and became, impossibly, melody. [576] A lullaby. [578] Ancient. [579] Specific. [580] Real. [581]

She wrote every note, every word that surfaced, her handwriting shaking with the urgency of preservation. [596] The monsoon clouds were building on the horizon, tall and dark and inevitable. [607]

She did not know if what she practiced was science or sorcery. [618] She did not know if the seeds truly held memory or if she was constructing meaning from coincidence. [633] But Tekua would have his mother's song by evening, and fourteen people would dream of sound again tonight. [650]

The ridge bloomed around her, luminous and doubtful and alive, and Maren moved to the next tree. [667]
