The ridge path ran like a white scar across the mountain's spine, lit by a moon so full it seemed to press its weight against the earth. [28] Nara climbed slowly, her boots finding the familiar grooves worn into stone by decades of patrol. [43] The left side of her face caught the moonlight differently than the right—the grafted skin there was smooth and tight, a topography of fire that she had stopped trying to hide years ago. [72]

In her hands she carried a cracked porcelain box, small enough to fit in one palm, though she cradled it in both. [92] It had been her daughter's. [97] Before the Lassen burn, before the wind shifted, before Nara had traded everything soft in herself for the ability to keep walking into flame. [118]

She was gently skilled at this—the climbing, the carrying, the breathing through altitude and memory simultaneously. [133] Twenty-two years of firefighting had made her body an instrument of precise endurance. [145] Her hands could read a slope the way a surgeon reads tissue, knowing exactly where to cut line, where to let the fire feed and where to starve it. [172] But those same hands had failed to hold onto the one thing that mattered. [185]

Jupiter and Saturn hung close together near the western horizon, caught in their slow dance of celestial bodies, an alignment that wouldn't repeat for another twenty years. [210] The last time they'd drawn this near, Maia had been seven, standing on this same ridge, pointing at the sky with a porcelain box full of teeth she'd lost that year. [240] She'd called them her collection of growing up. [249]

Nara had made a bargain that year, though she hadn't recognized it as one. [263] She'd taken the overtime, the hazard deployments, the weeks away from home that turned into months. [278] She told herself she was building something—retirement funds, insurance, a future where she and Maia would have time. [294] But what she was really doing was trading her daughter's childhood for her own sense of purpose. [310] Bargained innocence, spent like currency she could never earn back. [320] Maia grew up in the gaps between fire seasons, raised by grandparents and the blue glow of phone screens where Nara's face appeared, smoke-smudged and promising to come home soon. [348]

By the time Nara did come home—truly, permanently, with her face half-rebuilt and her lungs scarred quiet—Maia was nineteen and already gone. [370] Not dead. [372] Just gone, in the way children leave when they've learned that love is something that arrives late and smelling of ash. [391]

The porcelain box had cracked during the Lassen burn, when the house took an ember through the attic vent. [409] Nara had pulled it from the wreckage herself, the tiny teeth still rattling inside like seeds in a dried gourd. [430] She'd carried it on every deployment since, a reliquary of the innocence she'd spent. [445]

Now she sat on a flat stone at the ridge's highest point and opened the box by moonlight. [462] Five small teeth, ivory and impossible. [468] She turned each one over in her fingers, by reflecting deeply on what they meant—not just to her, but to anyone who had ever chosen the wrong devotion. [496]

That was what she wanted to do. [503] To enlighten, though the word felt too grand for what she meant. [515] She wanted to translate pain into a universal language, to find the sentence that would make a stranger weep not for Nara specifically but for their own version of this ridge, this box, this moonlight falling on the evidence of what they'd lost. [556]

She had started writing letters. [561] Not to Maia—those she'd sent and sent until the silence taught her to stop. [575] These letters were to no one and everyone, published in the small fire service quarterly that nobody read except other scarred people sitting in other dark rooms. [599] She wrote about the weight of teeth in a cracked box. [611] She wrote about how fire takes and also reveals, burning away everything but the hardest, most honest architecture of a life. [631]

Hard softness. [633] That was the only way to write it. [641] Tender words held in a fist. [648]

The planets inched closer to the ridgeline, almost touching now, and Nara closed the box and held it against her sternum, where her heartbeat pressed into the crack like a finger trying to hold something together. [684] She would climb back down. [689] She would write another letter. [694] She would keep translating until the language was large enough to hold what she'd done, and precise enough to forgive it. [714]

The moon moved. [717] The ridge held. [720] And somewhere below, in a city Nara could not see from here, Maia was awake too, reading the latest letter for the third time, turning her mother's hard soft words over like teeth in her palm, wondering if it was too late to write back. [762]

It was not. [765]
