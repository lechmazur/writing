The astral orchard had no business blossoming, and yet it did — pistachio trees erupting in pale green flowers across the surface of Asteroid 7714, their roots threading through rock that had never known rain. [36] Maren stood among them, bewildered, as she had been since the reading of her grandmother's will three days ago, which was also somehow three centuries ago, which was also somehow happening right now. [65]

She was a curator by profession, a keeper of other people's legacies, and she had never expected to inherit one so simply complicated as this. [89] The will had not been a document but a book — leather-bound, handwritten, its first page dated 1796 and its last page dated a year that hadn't happened yet. [114] Between the first and last page, the instructions were clear: she would find her inheritance not in sequence but in spirals, each revelation unlocking the previous one, each previous one reshaping what came after. [143] Nonlinear inheritance, the solicitor had called it, adjusting his spectacles as though the term were perfectly ordinary. [158]

The orchard was the third spiral, or perhaps the first. [168] Maren knelt beside a tree whose trunk split into a shape resembling a woman's profile — her grandmother's profile — and pressed her palm against the bark. [193] The bark was warm. [197] The asteroid was cold, airless by all reason, and yet she breathed, and the trees breathed with her, and somewhere in the canopy above, fruit was forming that looked like small green skulls. [228]

In her coat pocket, she carried the object that had started everything: a pistachio shell cameo blank, smooth and oval, carved from a shell but bearing no portrait. [254] Her grandmother had kept it in a velvet box labeled "YOUR FACE GOES HERE" in handwriting that managed to be both tender and threatening. [275] Maren had taken it to three antique dealers, all of whom refused to touch it. [289] The last one had locked his shop door while she was still inside and asked her, voice shaking, where she had obtained forbidden knowledge of that particular craft. [313]

She hadn't obtained any knowledge at all. [320] That was the problem. [324] That was why she had come to the orchard, following coordinates encoded in the book's margins, to inquire of whatever presence tended these impossible trees. [347]

"I don't understand what she left me," Maren said aloud. [357] Her voice carried strangely, as though the asteroid cupped it in stone palms. [369]

No answer came, so she did what she always did when the world became too much: she found a bathroom. [389] The orchard had one — a small stone outhouse nestled between two trees, which should have been absurd but instead felt inevitable. [409] She sat on the closed lid and stared at the cameo blank, turning it in her fingers, and the breakthrough arrived the way they always did for her — in porcelain-tiled solitude, in the democracy of a locked door. [446]

The blank wasn't waiting for her face. [453] It was waiting for her question. [459]

She pressed it to her lips and whispered: "What did you know?" [470]

The shell warmed. [473] The portrait appeared — not her grandmother's face, not her own, but something older, a composite of every woman in her line, features layered like geological strata. [496] And with the image came the knowledge, pouring in bright and disquieting, luminous and terrible: the orchard was a library, each tree a life, each fruit a choice that had been made or refused across generations. [530] The forbidden knowledge was not a secret but a perspective — the ability to see time as the trees saw it, all seasons simultaneous, all roots connected. [555]

Maren emerged from the outhouse trembling. [561] The orchard looked different now, each tree legible, their blossoms opening into sentences she could almost read. [575] She understood why her grandmother had left this to her specifically — not to scholars or mystics but to a curator, someone trained to preserve without possessing, to display without diminishing. [601]

She walked to the grandmother-tree and hung the cameo blank on a low branch, where it caught the light of a sun that was impossibly far away and impossibly present. [630] The portrait in the shell shifted, adding Maren's jawline to the composite, her searching eyes layered over all those others. [650]

Between the first and last page, the book had warned: "You will want to keep what you find. Don't. Tend it." [672]

So Maren, bewildered still but no longer lost, began to tend. [683] She pruned a branch. [687] She cleared fallen petals from the path. [694] She let the knowledge move through her the way light moved through the canopy — touching everything, possessing nothing, bright with a disquiet that was, she realized, simply love wearing its most complicated face. [727]

The orchard blossomed on. [731]
