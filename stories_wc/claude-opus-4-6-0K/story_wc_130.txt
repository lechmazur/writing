Maren had always believed that grief could be solved, the way one solves an equation — isolate the variable, reduce, find the elegant proof that turns chaos into clarity. [28] That belief had driven her underground, into the cavern orchard where ancient apple trees grew fat on mineral water dripping from stalactites, their roots threading through limestone like veins through a body that refused to die. [64] She came only after the orchard grew silent beneath the moon — after the bats had finished their spiraling hunts and the last drops of condensation had settled into the moss. [94] Silence was essential. [97] Noise introduced error. [100]

Tonight she knelt on the mosaic stepping stone at the orchard's center, the one her mother had laid decades ago from broken crockery and river glass. [126] Time and foot traffic had chipped the patterns into something new — fragments of roses now resembled orbital diagrams, and the blue geometric border had fractured into what looked, if you tilted your head, like a sequence. [162] Maren had spent months decoding it. [168] The chipped patterns on that mosaic stepping stone were her method, her Rosetta Stone for translating feeling into number. [187]

She was a conjurer by practice, secretive by necessity. [196] The villages above the cavern knew only that strange lights sometimes pulsed from the sinkhole entrance and that the apples tasted faintly of copper and wonder. [222] They did not know about the glass eye pair she kept in a velvet-lined tin — two perfect spheres the color of Baltic amber, crafted decades ago by a taxidermist who had been her mother's closest friend. [258] The eyes had been made for a fox that was never mounted, commissioned just before her mother walked into the deeper caves and did not return. [284]

No body was found. [288] No note. [290] No evidence of collapse or flood. [296] Just absence — the kind that never resolves into certainty, that sits in the chest like a stone the lungs must learn to breathe around. [320] Ambiguous loss, a therapist might have called it, though Maren had no therapist, only equations and a gently inventive mind that insisted there must be a formula hidden in the space between presence and disappearance. [355]

She placed the glass eyes on the mosaic, one on a chipped rose-become-orbit, the other on the fractured blue border. [375] They caught the faint bioluminescence of the cave lichen and seemed to look back at her with the patience of things that have witnessed every kind of waiting. [403]

The conjuring was quiet tonight. [408] She whispered variables — the exact mineral count of the stalactite water, the resonant frequency of the cavern's longest chamber, the number of rings in the oldest apple tree, the weight of an unfinished goodbye. [442] She had learned to dovetail these incompatible values, fitting the jagged edge of one measurement into the notch of another until they locked together and held. [468] Emotion and geology. [471] Memory and chemistry. [474] The hard data of the physical world joined seamlessly to the soft, unmeasurable ache of not knowing whether to mourn or to hope. [497]

The glass eyes glowed. [501] They always glowed at this stage, warming with a light that was neither spell nor science but something her mother might have recognized — the same light that had filled the mosaic when it was whole, before the patterns chipped and revealed their deeper language. [545]

Numbers cascaded through Maren's mind. [550] She did not find her mother tonight. [557] She never did. [560] But the equation refined itself, one more decimal place of precision, one more variable accounted for. [576] The mathematics of emotion, she was learning, did not converge on a single answer. [590] It converged on a practice — the repeated act of sitting with uncertainty and making something luminous from it. [608]

She gathered the glass eyes gently and returned them to their tin. [620] Above the cavern, the moon had shifted. [627] The stalactites resumed their patient dripping, feeding the trees that would bear copper-sweet fruit by autumn. [643]

Maren climbed the ladder toward the surface, carrying a kind of optimism she could not yet name — buried deep, like roots in limestone, but alive and reaching. [670] Tomorrow night she would return. [675] The equation was not finished. [680] Neither was she. [683]
