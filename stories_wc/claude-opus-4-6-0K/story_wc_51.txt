After the first snowmelt, when the runoff had carved its final channels through the mountainside and the air smelled of wet iron, Vael descended into the bronze grotto as she had every thaw for longer than she could remember. [37]

The walls caught starlight through the open vault above, bending it into copper-colored ribbons that swam across the stone. [55] She carried with her the kerosene lamp burner she had inherited from the weaver before her, its brass fittings green with age, its wick trimmed to a tongue-width so the flame would hold steady against the underground drafts. [90] She set it on the central pedestal, struck a match, and the grotto bloomed with overlapping light -- stellar and terrestrial tangled together until the shadows themselves seemed layered, shingled, hushed. [118]

That was the quality of this place: a shingled hush, silence stacked in overlapping planes like feathers on a wing, each layer dampening the one beneath until sound itself became residue. [148] Vael breathed inside it and felt the familiar compression, the way the quiet pressed her thoughts flat and spread them wide. [168] She was a fractal weaver. [172] Her craft was pattern -- the infinite recursion of shape within shape, grief nested inside grief, fear mirrored at every magnification. [191] She had come, as always, to collect the weights of different burdens. [202]

They waited for her in the grotto's alcoves: small deposits left by those who climbed the mountain through winter, who pressed their palms against the bronze walls and whispered what they carried. [231] The cold preserved them. [235] Frost held each burden in suspension -- a daughter's guilt over an unvisited mother, a soldier's nightly arithmetic of bodies, a widow's fury at the persistence of birdsong. [259] Now the melt had come, and the burdens were softening, threatening to calcify into crude mineral if no one intervened. [278] Calcified burdens could not be woven. [284] They became permanent, fusing to the grotto walls, adding mass to the mountain itself until the stone groaned with accumulated sorrow. [303]

Vael could not allow that. [308] She was boundary-lessly trapped -- not by chains, not by walls, not by any visible constraint. [322] The grotto had no door. [327] The sky gaped above her, vast and indifferent with its scattering of winter-remnant constellations. [340] She could walk out at any moment and never return. [350] That was the nature of her imprisonment: infinite freedom yoked to the knowledge that without her, the burdens would harden and the mountain would eventually split under their compounding weight. [378] No boundary held her except the one she rebuilt each year by choosing to descend. [392]

She lifted the first burden from its alcove -- the daughter's guilt, still damp, a translucent thing shaped like a clenched hand. [412] By orienting properly, she could read its grain, find the angle at which it caught the kerosene light and revealed its internal architecture. [434] She turned it slowly, watching the lamp's flame refract through its facets until the fractal skeleton emerged: guilt branching into memory, memory into longing, longing into a child's first understanding that love was not the same as presence. [468] There. [469] At that precise orientation, the burden became workable, pliant, ready for the loom. [481]

She threaded it into the pattern she had begun years ago, a tapestry that covered the grotto floor in recursive spirals. [500] Each burden she wove diminished slightly -- not erased, but distributed, its weight shared across the entire design so that no single point bore too much. [524] The soldier's arithmetic went next, then the widow's fury, each one oriented to the lamp, each one read and threaded before it could calcify. [548]

Hours passed in whalebone reverie, that particular quality of sustained attention that was rigid yet yielding, structured yet dreamlike, the mind bent into a shape it could hold indefinitely, like the ribs of ancient leviathans curving to contain an unfathomable interior. [588] Vael's hands moved without hesitation. [593] The starlight shifted as the constellations wheeled. [600] The lamp burned low, and she trimmed the wick with steady fingers, coaxing the flame back to its proper tongue-width. [618]

When dawn touched the grotto's rim, she stood and stretched, her spine cracking in the shingled hush. [636] The tapestry on the floor pulsed faintly with its new additions, fractal arms reaching inward and outward simultaneously, carrying weight at every scale. [659] She gathered the lamp burner and climbed toward the surface, knowing the grotto would fill again next winter with whispered confessions and frozen grief. [681] She would return after the snowmelt. [687] She always returned. [690] Not because she had to, but because she understood -- as only the boundary-lessly trapped can -- that the freedom to abandon a necessary thing is the heaviest burden of all, and she had long ago woven it into the pattern alongside everything else.
