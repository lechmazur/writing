The fortress bloomed at dusk like something that had forgotten how to die. [13]

Vines threaded through its crumbling ramparts, and wild jasmine erupted from arrow slits where archers once stood, filling the air with a sweetness that bordered on grief. [40] Luma walked the overgrown causeway toward its gates, her boots finding the rhythm of the chant she'd been murmuring since the valley road -- a low, half-sung incantation her grandmother had taught her, syllables that meant nothing in any living language but kept the dark at arm's length. [79] She chanted while walking because silence invited the weight back, and the weight was something she could not afford tonight. [97]

She was a wandering fireworks designer by trade, which meant she was a woman who made brief, blazing things for people who wanted to believe the sky could crack open and reveal something holy. [129] For three years she had traveled from festival to festival, mixing her compounds, timing her fuses, painting the dark with chrysanthemum bursts and whistling comets. [153] But the festivals had dried up after the war, and the villages that once pooled coins for her displays now pooled them for bread. [175] Hopelessness had a gravity all its own, pulling everything inward and downward, and Luma had felt it tugging at her sternum for months. [197] She had come to the fortress not for shelter but for a rumor -- a note embedded in the mosaic floor of the old chapel, left there by a designer who had come before her, a message laid tile by tile into the stonework generations ago. [237]

The chapel stood at the heart of the fortress, its dome open to the sky. [252] Tonight, there were no stars. [257] A hush lay over everything, thick as cotton in the ears, and the only light came from the phosphorescent lichen that clung to the walls in pale green constellations. [285] Luma set down her pack and pulled out the one tool she never traveled without: a fire spinner's kerosene rag knot, heavy and blackened from years of use. [312] She had never been a fire spinner herself, but the rag knot served her well -- she used it to test ignition points, to gauge wind direction, and tonight, to make just enough light to read the floor. [347]

She soaked the knot, struck her flint, and the chapel exhaled into amber. [360]

The mosaic spread beneath her in a vast spiral of blue, gold, and black tiles. [375] Most of it depicted the usual fortress iconography -- swords, sheaves of wheat, a sun with too many rays. [392] But near the center, where the spiral tightened, the pattern shifted. [402] Letters appeared among the tiles, subtle enough that a casual observer would see only decoration. [415] Luma knelt and began to filter the message from the noise, tracing each character with her fingertip, separating meaning from ornament through ambient awareness -- the same deep, receptive attention she used when mixing volatile compounds, where listening to the hiss and smell of a reaction told you more than any formula. [462]

She let the chant fall silent. [468] She let the chapel speak instead. [474]

Tile by tile, the note assembled itself: THE SKY IS NOT ABOVE YOU. [487] THE SKY IS WHAT YOU MAKE WHEN YOU REFUSE TO STOP BURNING. [499]

Luma sat back on her heels and laughed -- not bitterly, but with a serious kind of playfulness, the laugh of someone who recognizes a dare. [524] Another fireworks designer had knelt here, probably just as broke, just as tired, and had taken the trouble to lay a message in stone for whoever came next. [550] Not instructions for a formula. [555] Not a map to buried sulfur. [561] Just a stubborn, glittering refusal to go dark. [569]

She stood and carried the burning rag knot to the open dome, holding it high so the flame caught the updraft. [589] The lichen on the walls pulsed faintly, as if breathing with her. [601] Tomorrow she would walk to the nearest village and offer a display for free -- not because charity was sustainable, but because one bright night could remind people that wonder was still structurally sound, still load-bearing, still capable of holding up a roof against collapse. [639]

She would use what she had: leftover powder, salvaged casings, the mathematics of timing and altitude that lived in her hands. [659] And if the sky gave her no stars to compete with, all the better. [672] A blank canvas had never frightened her. [679]

Luma resumed her chant as she walked back through the jasmine-threaded corridors, her voice low and steady, each syllable a small defiance pressed into the starless air. [704] The fortress bloomed around her, crumbling and alive, and she carried the fire out through its gates like a sentence she intended to finish. [727]
