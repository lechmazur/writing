The rain had stopped only minutes before, and the parapet still whispered with the memory of it -- water threading through ancient stone channels, pooling in grooves carved by centuries of monsoons, trickling down to the moss gardens below. [42] Saya climbed the last step and stood where the fortress wall met the open sky, her fingers still smelling of hemp and brine from the day's work. [67] She was a net-mender by trade, but her reputation in the harbor village had grown strange and philosophical, because she could not resist tracing the patterns she found in torn nets back to the forces that broke them -- currents, tides, the geometry of fish in panic. [107]

Tonight she had brought the bamboo tea whisk. [115] It had belonged to her mother, who had whisked matcha each evening with a precise, circular motion that Saya only now understood as devotion made visible. [137] The whisk's tines were darkened with age, some slightly bent, and Saya carried it everywhere during firefly season because her mother had died in a summer just like this one, when the air pulsed gold and green with living light. [174]

She set a small clay bowl on the parapet's ledge and began to prepare tea by feel alone. [192] The powder hissed against the water. [198] The whisk sang its tiny, frothing song. [205] Below her, the first fireflies emerged from the wet grass, rising like sparks thrown upward from an invisible fire. [223]

Saya watched them and began to whistle -- a low, wandering melody her mother used to hum while mending nets beside her. [244] The sound carried across the wet stone and was absorbed by the dark. [256] There was something scintillatingly somber about this hour, the way beauty and grief occupied the same space without apology, each making the other more precise. [280]

She sipped the tea and studied the fireflies. [288] They were not random. [292] She had suspected this for years, the way she suspected torn nets were not random, the way storm damage on hulls was not random. [314] Hidden patterns governed everything, if you were patient enough to sit still and decode them. [328] The fireflies traced paths that followed the moon -- or rather, they followed the reflected moonlight pooling in certain patches of wet ground, navigating by lunar signatures written in standing water. [357] By following moon paths, they found each other. [365]

She had charted this across three firefly seasons. [373] Each evening she recorded their movements on sheets of rice paper, and when she overlaid the drawings, corridors emerged, highways of light that shifted as the moon shifted. [400] No one had asked her to do this. [407] No one funded the work or praised it. [414] This was precisely why it mattered to her -- to appreciate hidden effort, both in the insects who navigated a world of signals invisible to careless eyes, and in herself, who chose to look when no one required it. [448]

Her mother had been the same. [454] Every net Saya now mended still carried the foundational knots her mother had tied decades ago -- small, tight, virtually indestructible. [471] You would never see them unless you turned the net inside out and ran your fingers along the selvage edge. [490] Hidden effort. [492] The world was built on it. [498]

A breeze stirred the parapet. [503] The whispering grew louder, as though the stones themselves were recounting something they had overheard long ago. [519] Saya held the tea whisk up against the sky and looked through its splayed tines at the fireflies beyond. [538] Each tine framed a different cluster of light, and she turned it slowly, seeing how the patterns shifted with perspective. [557] A net, she thought. [561] Everything is a net. [565] The connections between nodes matter more than the nodes themselves. [575]

She finished her tea. [579] The moon climbed higher, and the firefly corridors tilted eastward in response, faithful to their hidden almanac. [596] Saya folded her rice paper into her coat and descended the parapet stairs with the demure audacity of someone who knows a secret the world has not yet asked to hear -- someone who will keep watching, keep charting, keep mending the torn places until the pattern reveals itself fully. [641]

The whisk rode in her pocket, tines pressing against her hip like fingers. [654] Tomorrow she would mend seventeen nets before noon. [662] Tomorrow evening she would climb these stairs again. [670] The fireflies would be waiting, drawing their moon-paths over wet grass, performing their scintillating, somber work for no audience at all. [690]

And Saya would be there to see it, which was itself a kind of mending -- the act of witnessing what would otherwise go unrecorded, tying a knot between what exists and what is known. [724]

The parapet whispered on behind her, rain-water finding its way down, following its own hidden paths in the dark. [743]
