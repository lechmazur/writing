The topaz workshop had no roof, only the sky, and the sky was losing its stars one by one. [20]

Maren noticed each disappearance the way most people notice a missed heartbeat—not with alarm, but with a peripheral wrongness that accumulated in the bones. [43] She stood at her letterpress, fingers stained with inks that had no names, arranging type blocks into sequences that were not quite language and not quite equations. [68] The press was ancient, its iron frame bolted to a workbench of rough-cut topaz crystal that caught whatever starlight remained and threw it in fractured gold across the open-air workshop walls. [96]

She was printing empathy. [100]

Not metaphorically. [102] Maren had spent eleven years attempting to decode the mathematics of emotion—the precise combinatorial logic by which one person's grief could transpose into another person's understanding. [125] She called it transposed empathy, this phenomenon where feeling migrated between bodies like a musical key shifting, preserving the intervals but changing every note. [148] Her letterpress was the instrument of that transposition. [156] Each block she set carried not a letter but an emotional coefficient, and the sheets she printed became instructions for the nervous system, bypassing cognition entirely. [178]

Tonight she was working with the halo fragment. [186]

It sat in a velvet-lined tray beside the press: a curved shard of something luminous, broken from a larger ring that Maren had never seen whole. [212] She'd found it years ago in a collapsed observatory, and when she touched it, she felt the residue of every emotion that had ever been directed at the sky—wonder, terror, supplication, the furious loneliness of astronomers watching light that had already died. [252] The fragment was her reference text, her Rosetta Stone. [261] From it she derived the values she set in type. [271]

Another star vanished. [274] The topaz workbench dimmed by a fraction. [281]

Maren picked up the fragment and held it against the composing stick, letting its glow illuminate the tiny blocks. [299] She was arranging tonight's sequence to disorient—deliberately, carefully, the way a surgeon dislocates a joint before resetting it. [317] Her method was ambiguity: she composed phrases that could be read as joy or mourning, triumph or surrender, so that the reader's mind would oscillate between interpretations until the boundary between self and other dissolved. [350] In that dissolution, transposition occurred. [355] You stopped knowing whose sadness you carried, and in not knowing, you finally understood it. [369]

She had learned this technique by borrowing personalities. [377] It was habitual now, almost involuntary—she would meet someone, and within minutes she'd be wearing their cadence, their posture, their particular flavor of attention. [400] She'd been accused of mockery, of manipulation, but it was neither. [410] It was research. [413] Each borrowed self was a data point in her grand equation. [424] She had been a grieving widower for three days in March, a giddy child for an afternoon in September, a furious dock worker for one electric hour that left her hands shaking. [453] She metabolized each identity and extracted its emotional prime factors, then returned to her press and set them in type. [472]

The stars were disappearing faster now. [478] The intervals between vanishings shortened like a quickening pulse. [487] Maren understood that she was working against a deadline that was also a darkness—that when the last star went, something fundamental about emotional reference would collapse. [510] People needed the stars not for navigation but for scale. [520] Without them, grief had no backdrop, joy no contrast, and empathy no medium through which to travel. [535]

She inked the press. [539] The halo fragment pulsed once, as if in recognition. [548] She laid a sheet of handmade paper across the type and pulled the lever, and the workshop filled with a sound like a bell struck underwater. [572]

The printed page glowed faintly. [577] She read it and felt her own sorrow arrive from the outside, transposed through the mathematics she had spent her life deriving, and for the first time she experienced herself as someone else might—cryptic, luminous, furiously alone, pressing meaning into paper while the universe subtracted its light. [618]

Another star disappeared. [621] Then another. [623]

Maren hung the page on the workshop wall where it caught the diminishing glow of the topaz and radiated its own small warmth. [645] She began setting the next sequence immediately, fingers moving with the lucid turbulence of someone who knows that clarity and chaos are the same thing observed from different distances. [673]

The sky darkened. [676] The press churned. [679] Between one vanishing star and the next, she kept translating what it meant to feel, racing the encroaching silence with ink and light and the stubborn belief that if she could solve the equation, no darkness would be total. [716]

The halo fragment flickered in its tray, patient and broken and radiant, waiting for the next impression. [732]
