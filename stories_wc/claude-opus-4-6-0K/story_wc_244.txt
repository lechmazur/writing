Nobody could confirm that Maren Solis actually existed, which was precisely how she preferred it. [16] She was the ghost in the supply chain, the signature on manifests that arrived in flood zones and earthquake rubble before anyone had officially requested them. [37] Relief workers across four continents knew her only through intermediaries, forwarded emails, and the faint smell of peppermint tea left on clipboards at staging areas she had already vacated. [60] An elusive disaster-relief logistician by trade, she had spent eleven years perfecting the art of presence without proximity, and she told herself this was professionalism, not pathology. [85]

She told herself a lot of things. [92]

The disused railway station outside Velden had been swallowed by ivy so thoroughly that the platform resembled a green throat mid-swallow. [112] Maren had chosen it as a temporary base because it still had functioning electrical outlets and because no one in their right mind would look for anyone here. [138] She sat on an overturned luggage cart, sorting donation receipts and cracking jokes to no one. [153] "What did the tarp say to the tent?" she asked the empty ticket booth. [166] "You've got me covered." [170] She laughed alone, desperately jocular, the humor a tourniquet she applied to something she refused to name. [186]

On the counter beside her sat a fragment of moon rock, sealed in a resin disc the size of a poker chip. [206] It had been a gift from a NASA engineer she had helped relocate after Hurricane Delma—one of those debts people insisted on repaying even when she begged them not to. [237] That was the trouble with her work: every act of aid generated an obligation, and every obligation generated contact, and every contact threatened to become a relationship. [261] She was bound by reciprocity whether she liked it or not, tethered to a web of gratitude she kept trying to outrun. [281]

The rumor that changed everything was, by any reasonable standard, absurd. [292] It began when a truck driver in Lisbon told a dockworker that a logistician matching Maren's description had been spotted near Velden. [311] The dockworker mentioned it to a journalist. [318] The journalist told a retired pharmacologist named Udo, who had been searching for Maren for three months because she had once saved his clinic's entire vaccine supply during a civil emergency and he had never thanked her properly. [352] Udo told his daughter, who posted in a forum for disaster-response volunteers, which reached a coordinator in Vienna, who drove to Velden on a hunch. [377] Through this improbable rumor chain, a knock arrived at the station door on a Thursday evening. [392]

Maren considered hiding. [395] The ivy would have covered her. [401] Instead, she opened the door and said, "Welcome to Platform Nowhere, departures are indefinite, and the cafe is closed but the ambiance is free." [422]

The coordinator's name was Petra, and she did not laugh. [433] She handed Maren a letter from Udo, which contained a photograph of his clinic staff holding a banner that read THANK YOU, GHOST LADY. [456] Beneath the photograph was a handwritten line: "You cannot keep giving without receiving. [467] It is rude." [470]

Maren sat down on the ivy-cracked platform and held the moon rock up to the light. [486] A piece of another world, given freely, impossible to return. [496] She had spent years trying to catalyze recovery in others while refusing it for herself, treating her own loneliness as an operational advantage rather than a wound. [520] She had been searching for the cure for loneliness in the wrong direction—outward, always outward, as if enough shipments and enough clever jokes could fill the space where a mutual life should be. [551]

"Udo wants to host a dinner," Petra said, leaning against the doorframe with the easy patience of someone who had nowhere else to be. [574] "He says you owe him the pleasure of your company." [584]

"That's emotional blackmail," Maren said. [590]

"That's reciprocity," Petra corrected, politely. [596]

And this was when the story changed—not with a catastrophe, but with a small, anarchic act of surrender. [613] Maren pocketed the moon rock, folded Udo's letter into her jacket, and stepped off the platform into the overgrown gravel where no trains ran anymore and no schedule applied. [641] She did not make a joke. [647] She did not deflect. [651] She said, "All right. [655] Tell me where and when." [660]

The ivy shifted in the wind, reclaiming another inch of the station behind her, closing over the place where she had hidden as though it had never been a door at all. [694]

Somewhere ahead, a table was being set. [702]
