The lighthouse prison off the jagged reef had not held a living prisoner in forty years, but it held Marcus well enough. [22]

He was the son of the boy who cried wolf — not the fable's boy, but a real man named Peter Harlan, who had spent his life raising alarms no one believed. [51] Peter had warned about the foundation rot beneath the coastal bridge, the contamination in the aquifer, the bodies buried under the new municipal lot. [72] Each time he was right, and each time it was too late, and each time the town decided he must have been involved. [92] They called him the wolf-crier, and when he finally disappeared, no one looked for him. [107]

Marcus had inherited his father's curse: the compulsion to speak truths that sustained impossibilities, truths so improbable they sounded like lies. [125] He knew where the bodies were — his father's among them — beneath the lighthouse foundation, packed into the old cistern before the prison was decommissioned. [147] He had come to the island alone, by stolen dinghy, to find proof before they find the bodies on their own terms, before the demolition crew arrived Monday morning and the town council could shape the narrative without him. [183]

The copperlight of late afternoon poured through the salt-crusted lantern room and turned everything below to amber. [199] Marcus descended the spiral stairs, trailing his hand along the curved wall where plaster had gone soft with decades of sea damp. [220] At the base of the tower, a narrow corridor led to the old confessional — an absurd feature, installed when the prison held men who were expected to repent before execution. [247] Its lattice screen had been pried from the wall at some point and left leaning against the frame, the woodwork dark with age, each diamond-shaped opening clogged with dust and spider silk. [278]

He picked up the lattice. [283] Through its grid the corridor beyond fragmented into dozens of small, framed views, and he saw the narrow door at the far end — left ajar for decades, its frame scarred with scuffs from prisoners who had been dragged through it. [318] The scuffs told a story: deep gouges at ankle height, long lateral scratches from handcuffs raked across wood, and near the top, the faint crescent impressions of fingernails. [346]

Marcus set the lattice down and pressed through. [354]

Beyond the door, the corridor dropped into a lower passage that smelled of brine and copper — the copperlight seeping through a crack in the ceiling, painting the stone walls in hues of old pennies. [386] He was chasing hush now, following the silence deeper, because silence was where the dead kept their evidence. [403] Every step threaded the labyrinth with his own story, the way his father had tried to thread it with warnings. [421] Marcus would do what Peter never could: arrive at the center with proof, emerge with something no one could dismiss. [440]

The passage opened into the cistern room. [447] The air was cold and still, and in the copper light that filtered from somewhere impossibly above, dust motes seemed to hover, suspended as if time itself had thickened. [474] They hung like witnesses. [478]

The cistern's cover had been replaced with poured concrete, but the concrete had cracked — the same foundation rot his father had always been able to smell out. [503] Marcus knelt and pulled chunks away. [509] The odor that rose was not what he expected: not decay, but mineral stillness, the scent of bones long past their grieving. [530]

He lowered his phone's light into the gap. [538] Fabric, mostly gone. [541] A belt buckle. [544] The edge of a jaw. [549] And beside it — his breath caught — a small notebook wrapped in plastic, the kind his father always carried. [566]

Marcus reached in and retrieved it. [572] The pages were brittle but legible, filled with Peter's cramped handwriting: names, dates, coordinates. [585] Everything the town had refused to hear. [591]

He sat back against the cistern wall and held the notebook to the copperlight. [604] The dust still hovered around him, patient and luminous. [612] He read his father's words, and for the first time in his life, the wolf-crier's son did not need to shout. [632] The evidence would speak in the hush his father had never been granted. [644]

Monday the crew would come. [649] Monday the town would learn. [654] But tonight, in the amber stillness of the lighthouse prison, Marcus threaded the last passage of the labyrinth — not with a warning, but with proof held gently in copper-stained hands, hovering between grief and something almost like repose. [690]

He closed the notebook and began the climb back up toward the lantern room, toward the dinghy, toward the world that had never listened. [714] This time, he would not cry wolf. [721] He would simply open the notebook and let the dead speak for themselves. [733]
