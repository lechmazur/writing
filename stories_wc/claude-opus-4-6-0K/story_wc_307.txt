The floating rock hung above the valley like a held breath, tethered to nothing, suspended by the same ancient magnetism that pulled the grotto's iron walls into alignment with the stars. [33]

Lira sat cross-legged at its center, her body the paradox it had always been — hands smooth as a child's, eyes carrying the depth of someone who had lived ninety-three years and was now unwinding backward through time. [66] At sixty-one she had discovered the reversal. [73] At forty she had stopped pretending it frightened her. [82] Now, wearing the face of a woman no older than twenty-five, she understood that her condition was not a curse but a curriculum, each reclaimed year peeling back another layer of knowing until she would arrive, eventually, at the raw beginning. [115]

Her student knelt at the platform's edge, afraid to look down. [126] Cael had traveled three weeks to find her, following rumors of a researcher who aged in the wrong direction and who could teach a person how to vanish. [152] Not disappear — vanish. [156] There was a difference, Lira had told him, though she had not yet explained what it was. [171]

"Close your eyes," she said, her voice carrying the tone of sycamore hush, that particular stillness found beneath broad leaves when the wind pauses and the world listens to itself. [199] "We enter the trance together." [204]

Cael obeyed. [206] The platform drifted almost imperceptibly, rotating so the magnetic grotto below them opened like a dark mouth under starlight. [224] Iron veins in the grotto walls caught the constellations and held them, bending their light into slow spirals that rose and lapped at the floating rock's underside. [249] Lira felt the pull in her sternum, the familiar tug of the grotto's field aligning her heartbeat with the planet's molten core. [270]

"I'm going to throw a stone into the water," she said. [281] Below the grotto, a still pond lay cupped in basalt. [291] She produced a river-smoothed pebble from her sleeve and let it fall. [303] It struck the surface with a sound like a single syllable of truth. [315]

"Watch the rings," she whispered through the trance, though his eyes were closed. [327] He would see them anyway — the trance made observers of the mind. [339] "Tell me what you notice." [344]

"They expand," Cael said. [348]

"Yes. And then?" [351]

"They fade." [353]

"Do they?" [355] Lira let the silence stretch. [360] She was a woman who weaves truth carefully, never offering the full shape until the student's own attention had traced its outline. [380] She could have told him everything in a single sentence, but a revelation delivered too early becomes information, not understanding. [397] So she chose to withhold. [401]

The rings continued outward, thinning, losing amplitude. [408] Cael's breathing slowed as he tracked them through the trance. [418] Minutes passed. [420] The rings reached the pond's basalt edges and reflected back, crossing the newer rings still expanding from the center. [437] Interference patterns bloomed — places where wave met wave and the water stood perfectly still, and places where the surface leapt twice as high. [460]

"There," Lira said. [463] "The places where the water is flat. What happened to the wave?" [474]

"It canceled." [476]

"It appears to have vanished," she corrected gently. [484] "But follow the pattern. The energy is still present. It has simply been redistributed into the peaks. The wave did not disappear. It taught itself to appear somewhere else." [510]

She felt the moment his understanding shifted, a warmth rising through the trance like dawn entering a room. [527]

"To teach vanishing to appear," he murmured, repeating the old phrase he'd heard in the rumors, finally hearing what it meant. [548] Vanishing was not absence. [552] It was presence relocated, energy folded into a new expression through the patterns in the rings of a pond after a stone is thrown. [574]

Lira smiled with her young-old face. [580] This was why she withheld — not from cruelty but from reverence for the moment a mind discovers its own shape in the answer. [602] Delayed revelation was the only kind that changed a person. [612]

"Your grief," she said softly, naming at last the reason he had truly come. [625] "The person you lost. They have not disappeared." [634]

Cael's breath caught. [637]

"They are the peak where the flat water sent its energy. [647] You simply have not yet learned to look at the right part of the pond." [661]

The grotto's magnetic light pulsed beneath them, stars bending in the iron. [673] The platform turned. [676] Lira felt herself a year younger than she had been at dawn, another ring of knowledge smoothing backward into simplicity. [695] Someday she would be an infant, all truth compressed to a single cry. [708] But tonight, suspended above the earth in sycamore hush, she had given one student the shape of what he needed, and the trance held them both like water holds a stone — briefly, completely, before letting it fall through to somewhere new.
