The amber grotto held the last of the dusk like a jar holds honey, thick and slow and warm. [18]

Maren arrived early, as she always did, because she was professionally thorough in ways that made her clients trust her and her competitors despise her. [43] She set her case on the smooth calcite ledge and opened it with the care of a surgeon preparing instruments. [60] Inside, thirty-two vials of synthetic emotion gleamed in neat rows -- joy cut with nostalgia, grief laced with relief, desire threaded through with just enough guilt to make it feel earned. [89] Every one of them was counterfeit, and every one of them was more popular than the real thing. [107]

She was the best dealer in the region, not because her product was the purest, but because she understood the half truths that made emotions believable. [132] Pure joy was suspicious. [136] Pure grief was unbearable. [140] People wanted their feelings diluted with contradiction, the way life actually delivered them. [153] Maren had built her trade on that principle: never sell a whole truth when a half truth will last longer. [171]

She pulled a single fragrance chemist's blotter petal from her breast pocket -- a delicate paper leaf stained with a formula she had been refining for months. [198] This was not for a client. [204] This was for her. [208]

The grotto's amber walls pulsed with the fading sun, casting everything in tones of old gold and dark tea. [228] Stalactites dripped mineral water into shallow pools that hummed with residual charge. [239] That charge was the reason she had chosen this place. [249] Maren's method was unusual even among dealers: she sensed emotion through static electricity, reading the tiny fluctuations in charge that living feelings produced on skin, in air, between bodies. [277] Here, surrounded by mineral conductivity and ionized dusk, the static field was exquisite. [290]

She held the blotter petal between two fingers and inhaled. [300] The scent was layered -- amber resin, green cardamom, something metallic underneath like a copper bell struck once and left to ring. [321] It carried the compound she had synthesized in secret: not a counterfeit emotion, but a catalyst designed to fuse insight with empathy. [344] For years she had sold feelings to others while keeping her own partitioned, studied, professionally dissected. [359] Affectionate detachment, her ex-lover had called it, half admiring, half accusing. [370] You care about everyone in theory and no one in practice. [381]

That was a half truth too. [387] Maren cared. [389] She simply could not feel the caring and understand it at the same time. [402] Insight or empathy -- the mind offered one, then snatched away the other, like a coin that would not land on both sides. [424]

The blotter petal dissolved against her tongue. [431] She closed her eyes and placed her palms flat against the amber wall. [443]

Static moved through her fingers first, then her wrists, then her chest. [455] The grotto's charge acted as a conductor for the compound, amplifying it, pulling it through her nervous system the way sap moves through ancient wood. [479] She felt the edges of herself soften. [486] The partition between knowing and feeling began to thin. [496]

As the transformation completed, Maren understood what her clients had always been chasing. [509] Not the counterfeit emotions she sold them, but this -- the moment when analysis did not subsume feeling, when empathy did not drown thought, when both existed together in the same breath like two notes in a chord. [546] She felt affection for the people she had served, and she understood exactly why, and neither truth diminished the other. [567]

Tears came, and she let them, and she noted their salinity and temperature with a precision that did not make them less real. [591]

The amber walls darkened as dusk gave way to early night. [602] The static field settled. [606] Maren opened her eyes and looked at her case of vials, all those beautiful half truths waiting for their buyers. [625] She would not stop selling them. [631] People needed their contradictions packaged neatly, and she was still professionally thorough enough to provide that service. [648] But she would reformulate. [652] She would thread the catalyst into every vial -- just a trace, just enough to crack the partition a fraction wider in each customer who inhaled. [676]

Not the whole truth. [680] She knew better than to inflict that on anyone. [690] But a half truth that leaned a little closer to whole. [701]

She packed the case, tucked the empty blotter petal's ghost of scent into memory, and walked out of the grotto into the warm electric dark, feeling everything she knew and knowing everything she felt. [737]
