Maren held the blowpipe to her lips and whispered into it like a prayer before the gather, watching the molten glass catch light from the cracked window above. [28] "And now," she announced to the empty room, her voice a theatrical boom that bounced off dead instrument panels, "our heroine attempts the perilous inflation of Sphere Number Forty-Seven, a globe of tremendous consequence, upon which the fate of all curious minds depends." [63]

She inflated slowly, cheeks taut, rotating the pipe with the patience of someone who had learned that rushing shattered things. [81] The abandoned control room of the Vosberg River Dam had become her studio three months ago, when the ice was still a locked jaw across the valley. [104] Now, mid-spring, the thaw sent meltwater drumming through channels beneath the concrete floor, a pulse she felt through her boots. [123] The dam's gauges were dead, its operators long reassigned, but Maren liked the switches and dials surrounding her workspace -- they suggested that someone, once, had believed in measuring the unmeasurable. [150]

She set the finished sphere in the annealing oven she'd rigged from the room's old heating unit. [166] Forty-seven glass orbs now, each one destined for a shelf, a table, a windowsill in the community learning house she was building downstream. [188] Safe zones for inquiry, she called them -- spaces where a child could pick up a glass sphere full of trapped color and ask why does light bend, where does blue come from, what happens when something breaks. [220] Questions she wished someone had let her ask when she was small and her father's silence was its own kind of ice. [241]

"The heroine pauses to hydrate," she narrated, lifting a dented thermos, "a task of staggering importance, often underestimated by lesser adventurers." [261] She drank. [263] The water tasted like snowmelt and iron. [270] Somewhere outside, the river groaned as another shelf of ice gave way, calving into the current with a sound like a door finally opening. [292]

On the console beside her tools lay a cracked leather bookmark, its surface mapped with fissures the way old skin maps a life. [314] It had belonged to her father, the only item she'd taken from his house after the funeral. [330] He had used it in his engineering manuals, those heavy texts he read instead of speaking. [345] She kept it not out of sentimentality but as evidence -- proof that he had, at least, been searching for something between those pages, even if he never found the words to share it. [375]

Maren was, by nature, thoughtfully spirited -- she carried weight but refused to let it flatten her. [391] Her dramatic narrations had started as a joke with her apprentice years ago, a way to make the tedious stretches of glasswork bearable. [411] But after her father died, after the long frost of grief locked her chest so tight she couldn't draw breath for the blowpipe, the narration became something else. [437] A method of re-entry. [441] If she could describe the mundane -- sweeping glass dust, adjusting the flame, wiping her hands -- with grandeur and lightness, she could coax herself back into the world one sentence at a time. [470]

"Chapter next," she said, pulling a fresh gather from the furnace. [481] "In which our heroine shapes the forty-eighth orb and contemplates the radical act of abandoning her solitude." [497]

She paused. [499] The word sat in the room like a bell tone. [508] Abandon. [509] She had come to this concrete shell to work alone, to thaw at her own pace, away from the town's kind but clumsy sympathy. [531] But the learning house was nearly ready, and the glass orbs needed hands to hold them -- small hands, curious hands. [550] To keep hiding here was its own kind of freezing. [560]

The meltwater surged beneath her. [565] She thought of the river outside, how ice doesn't thaw all at once but in cracks and surrenders, each fissure letting the current speak a little louder. [590] Her father's bookmark lay on the console, cracked but still holding its shape, still marking a page someone might return to. [610]

She blew into the pipe. [615] The glass expanded, luminous and fragile, a small planet forming in her breath. [627] "The heroine resolves," she said quietly, her narration losing its theater and finding something truer beneath, "to carry her forty-eight glass worlds down the hill tomorrow morning. [656] She resolves to unlock the learning house door. [664] She resolves to let the children ask every question she was never allowed to speak." [677]

The orb glowed amber in the dim control room. [685] Outside, the ice kept loosening its grip on the valley, and the river ran louder, and Maren shaped glass with steady hands while the season did its patient, irreversible work on everything that had been frozen. [718]

She set the forty-eighth sphere down gently. [726] "End of chapter," she whispered. [731] Then, softer still: "Beginning of the next." [739]
