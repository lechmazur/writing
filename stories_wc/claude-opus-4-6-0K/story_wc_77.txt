The funhouse mirrors still held light they should not have held. [11]

Maren noticed it the moment she ducked through the warped entrance, stepping over shattered bulbs and the carcasses of mechanical clowns: a glow persisted in every reflective surface, not from the moon, not from her flashlight, but from something older, something the carnival had swallowed before it died. [57] Lingering luminance, her advisor had called it, whispering the term into her ear three days after they pulled her back from clinical death. [76]

Three days after the resuscitation, and the world still looked like a photograph she had ruined by existing in it. [95] Every image that captured her face since the flatline came out wrong—overexposed, smeared, her features replaced by a white blur that technicians could not explain. [118] Photographically cursed, the hospital staff joked, until security footage from the ICU showed the same corruption spreading to frames she had never posed for, bleeding into monitors, into reflections, into glass. [148]

"You carried something back," the advisor had whispered, standing at the foot of her hospital bed, her voice so low that Maren had to read her lips. [175] The woman never raised her volume above a hush, as though louder speech might alert the thing now grafted to Maren's shadow. [198] She called herself Sorrel, and she wore an opera cloak fastened at the throat by a tarnished silver clasp shaped like a moth swallowing its own wings. [225] That clasp caught every stray photon in the room and held it, trembling, the same way the funhouse mirrors held their impossible glow. [247]

Sorrel had given Maren a book: a dream dictionary, leather-bound, its pages filled with paradoxical notes scrawled in margins too narrow to contain them. [270] Under "Fear," someone had written: *It cannot survive being fully seen; therefore it teaches you never to look.* [287] Under "Light," the note read: *What lingers after death is not illumination but appetite.* [300] And under "Mirror," in handwriting that changed halfway through the sentence: *The reflection is the original. You are the copy it despises.* [319]

Maren had read every entry, cross-referenced them, and understood at last the method Sorrel proposed: to trick fear into revealing its weakness by forcing it to unbosom itself—to confess, to shed its concealment—inside a place built entirely for deception. [358]

A funhouse was fear's temple and fear's trap. [367]

Now she walked the corridor of warped glass, and every mirror showed her not as a blur but as something exquisitely wrong—her face stretched, compressed, multiplied, each distortion radiating that sickening glow. [397] The luminance throbbed like a heartbeat she no longer trusted her own chest to produce. [412] It was repulsive. [415] It was magnetic. [418] She could not stop staring. [423]

"Speak to it," Sorrel whispered from the entrance, too afraid to follow, her moth-clasp glinting. [438] "Use the dictionary's language. Paradox is the only tongue it cannot mimic." [451]

Maren pressed her palm against the nearest mirror. [459] The glass was warm, almost wet, and her reflection pressed back with a hand that had too many fingers. [477]

"You are the light that proves darkness exists," she said, quoting the entry under "Confession." [492] "You are the fear that proves I survived." [500]

The reflection opened its mouth—her mouth—and sound poured out, not screaming but unbosoming, a torrent of whispered truths: it was afraid of being named, afraid of stillness, afraid that the luminance it fed on would one day simply stop because Maren would stop fearing the glow. [545] Every syllable tasted like bile and wonder, revulsion braided with fascination, and Maren did not look away. [563]

The mirrors cracked in sequence, a domino cascade of splintering silver, and with each break the lingering luminance bled out, pooling on the floor like mercury before evaporating into nothing. [592] Her reflection in the final intact mirror was just her: tired, alive, unphotographable perhaps, but no longer host to something hungrier than grief. [614]

She exhaled. [616]

Behind her, Sorrel stepped inside at last, the opera cloak clasp now dull, the moth no longer catching light because there was no stolen light left to catch. [643] "It told you," Sorrel whispered. [648]

"It told me everything," Maren said. [654] "Fear's weakness is that it needs us more than we need it." [666]

She picked up a shard of mirror, tilted it toward her face, and saw only darkness—ordinary, beautiful, uncorrupted darkness. [684]

For the first time since the resuscitation, she smiled, and nothing in the glass flinched. [699]

The carnival stayed abandoned. [703] But the funhouse, emptied of its luminance, finally looked like what it had always been—just a building, just paint and plywood, just a trick that only worked if you believed it. [733]

Maren walked out into the night, uncursed, unafraid, carrying nothing back this time. [746]
