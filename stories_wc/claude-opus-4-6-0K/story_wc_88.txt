After the procedure, Mara woke to blue light. [8]

Not the sterile fluorescence of the clinic but something alive — a trembling, underwater glow that pulsed like breathing. [26] She lay on stone at the edge of an underground lake where bioluminescent organisms painted the cavern ceiling in constellations no astronomer had ever named. [51] Beautiful, she thought, and then immediately: so what. [59]

That was the procedure talking. [64] Dr. Liang had promised it would strip the emotional wiring clean — no more guilt, no more nightmares about the people she had hurt during her years running black site interrogations. [93] A clean slate. [96] She had paid for it with money earned from dirty work, which felt like a kind of poetry she could no longer appreciate. [116]

She sat up. [119] Her body felt delicately robust — tender from the surgery yet somehow stronger, as though removing sentiment had freed some physical reserve. [139] Her rucksack sat beside her. [144] Inside: three bottles of water, a flashlight she would not need in this glowing cathedral, yesterday's newspapers, and a baseball. [163]

The baseball was the reason she had come. [171]

It was signed in silver ink: "For Mara — you will know when. — J. Calloway, 2089." [186] She had found it in her apartment six months ago with no explanation. [198] Calloway did not exist in any database she could access, and 2089 had not happened yet. [214] A baseball signed by a time traveler. [221] She had laughed when she first held it, back when laughing still meant something. [234]

Then the newspapers started arriving. [239] Not delivered — just appearing on her doorstep, ordinary papers from ordinary days. [251] But Mara had spent fifteen years extracting hidden messages from people who refused to talk, and she knew how to read between the lines. [275] First letters of specific sentences. [280] Bolded words in advertisements. [284] A trail of breadcrumbs arranged across classified ads, obituaries, and box scores, all pointing her toward this underground lake beneath the Ozarks, toward what Calloway's coded messages called "the labyrinth." [315]

She had assumed it was metaphorical. [321] Standing now at the water's edge, watching tunnels branch in seven directions from the cavern, each glowing a different shade of impossible blue, she understood it was not. [349]

The labyrinth of choices. [353] Each tunnel, according to the final decoded message, led to a different version of what came next. [368] Not metaphysical nonsense — Calloway had been precise about that. [377] Each path held a different person, a different conversation, a different chance to face something irreversible that Mara had done. [396]

Before the procedure, she would have wept at the possibility. [406] Now she studied the tunnels with the flat pragmatism of someone reading a menu. [419] She could recognize beauty and significance intellectually while feeling absolutely nothing about either — a kind of jaded wonder that made the glowing cavern feel like a painting behind glass. [449] The water reflected on the walls in slow, rippling patterns. [459] Organisms that had evolved in total darkness for millennia, producing light for no audience until today. [474] Magnificent and meaningless, like everything after the procedure. [482]

She picked up the baseball and turned it in the blue light. [494] Calloway's final message had been explicit about her motivation: to kindle empathy where none remains. [509] Not in others. [512] In herself. [514] The labyrinth was not punishment or reward. [521] It was treatment. [524] Each tunnel held someone she had broken during her years in the black sites, and each conversation was designed to rebuild, synapse by synapse, what the procedure had cut away. [553]

Calloway had known she would seek the procedure. [561] Had known she would try to flee her conscience rather than face it. [573] Had sent the baseball and the newspapers as a lifeline thrown backward through decades, a journey she could not refuse because curiosity survived even when compassion did not. [601]

She chose the third tunnel. [606] Not for any reason. [610] Reasons required feelings. [613]

The water was warm around her ankles. [620] The bioluminescence intensified as she walked deeper, as though the organisms sensed her presence, as though the lake itself was paying attention. [643] The tunnel narrowed. [646] Ahead, she heard breathing that was not her own. [655]

A woman sat against the wall, illuminated in pale green light. [666] Mara recognized her. [669] Detainee Nineteen. [671] Farrah. [672] The one who had begged. [677]

Mara felt nothing. [680] Then — delicate, robust, stubborn as those ancient organisms making light in the dark — she felt the faintest flicker of something she could not yet name. [706] She sat down across from Farrah, and listened. [714]
