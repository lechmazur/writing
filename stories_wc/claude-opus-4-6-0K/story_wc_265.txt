Maren woke beneath a canopy of brass fronds, her cheek pressed against moss that smelled of copper and rain. [18] This was not where she had fallen asleep. [26] It never was. [29]

She had translocated again during the night, her body surrendered to whatever law governed her passage through the mechanical rainforest, deposited in a clearing she had never seen before. [56] Spiraling trunks of riveted steel rose around her, their branches fanning into thousands of thin aluminum leaves that shivered and rang in the morning wind. [77] Each species of mechanical tree produced its own voice: the iron oaks groaned low, the copper palms chattered bright, and the titanium ferns whispered frequencies she could feel in her teeth. [104] The sound of wind through different trees was the forest's only language, and Maren had spent the last several months learning to listen. [125]

She sat up and brushed filaments of wire-grass from her coat. [136] Once, she had been a professor of epistemology in a concrete city where knowledge was catalogued, debated, and ultimately tamed. [153] Then the sixth sense had awakened in her, sudden and uninvited, like a door slamming open in the basement of her skull. [172] It was not sight or hearing or anything the textbooks named. [183] It was the hum of insight itself, a vibration beneath thought, and it made every lecture she delivered sound hollow. [200] Her colleagues called her breakdown a tragedy. [207] Maren called it an eviction notice from a life too small. [218]

She became a stray philosopher, one who wandered without institution or tenure, driven by a single relentless motivation: to rediscover the wild frontier of her mind. [243] The mechanical rainforest had drawn her the way a magnet draws iron dust, because here the boundary between mechanism and miracle was so thin she could press her thumb through it. [271]

In her palm she still clutched the small gear she had found the previous evening, just before sleep took her. [290] It was no larger than a thumbnail, its teeth impossibly fine, and it had been lying in the dirt at the base of a singing magnolia as though it had fallen from the sky. [321] Or from her. [324] She could not be certain. [329] Since the sixth sense had awakened, certainty had become the least interesting thing about the world. [344]

She held the gear up to the light filtering through the metal canopy. [356] The teeth caught the wind and the gear began to spin on her fingertip, emitting a tone so precise it harmonized with every tree simultaneously. [379] The forest answered. [382] Leaves rang in cascading octaves, iron oaks resonated with copper palms, titanium ferns vibrated against nickel birches, and for one stretched moment the entire rainforest became a single chord. [407]

Maren felt the hum of insight swell behind her sternum, not as metaphor but as physical pressure, and the fabric of something she had carried all her life began to unravel. [438] It was the tight weave of assumptions she had mistaken for identity: that knowledge must be proven to be real, that the mind's wilderness must be fenced, that miracles required the prefix im- before possible. [470] Thread by thread, the old epistemology came apart, and what remained was not emptiness but space, a vast interior clearing she had forgotten existed. [494]

The chord faded. [497] The gear stopped spinning and lay still in her palm, warm as a living thing. [512] Maren looked at the clearing around her and understood why she translocated during sleep. [525] The forest was not moving her at random. [532] It was placing her where the next lesson waited, the way a teacher sets a book on a student's desk before the bell rings. [554] The small gear was today's lesson: that even the tiniest mechanism, when it finds its resonance, can make a whole world sing. [575]

She pocketed the gear and stood. [581] Above her, the brass fronds swayed, and the wind shifted to thread through a grove of chromium willows she had not noticed before, their voice a low, probable hymn, not quite impossible, not quite ordinary, the exact register where miracles live. [618] Maren walked toward them. [622]

Tonight she would sleep, and the forest would carry her elsewhere. [633] Tomorrow she would wake and not know where she was, and that not-knowing would be the truest compass she had ever held. [654] The wild frontier of her mind stretched out in every direction, unmapped and ringing, and she was finally, gratefully, lost enough to find it. [679]
