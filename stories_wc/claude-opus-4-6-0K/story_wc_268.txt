The temple library existed in the pause between one constellation and the next, suspended in a breath the cosmos had forgotten to exhale. [26] Its shelves stretched beyond geometry, carved from stone that remembered when the first gods were young, and its corridors smelled of dust older than language. [49] Time did not pass here so much as pool, gathering in still eddies around the reading alcoves and dripping slowly from the vaulted ceilings. [72]

Maren was a diminutive titan, barely four feet tall, with shoulders that could bear the weight of collapsing dynasties and hands small enough to turn the most fragile pages without tearing them. [101] She moved through the library with the unhurried grace of someone who understood that urgency was just another form of blindness. [120] Her robes were plain undyed linen, though she was heir to one of the seven celestial thrones, and she wore no crown, no signet, no ornament beyond the ink stains on her fingertips. [152] Regally unpretentious, the scholars had always called her, and she had always taken it as the highest compliment. [170]

She had come to the lost temple library because someone on the Alabaster Throne was not who they claimed to be. [191]

The pretender had been careful, assuming the face and mannerisms of her brother Sorath with uncanny precision. [208] But Maren had noticed the wrongness in small things: the way he held his scepter a fraction too high, the way he failed to laugh at the old jokes their mother used to tell. [240] When she confronted him privately, he had smiled Sorath's smile and banished her to the edges of the realm. [259] No one believed her. [263] The pretender's illusion was too perfect for ordinary sight. [272]

So she had sought extraordinary sight. [278]

The Rune of Drift was ancient beyond reckoning, a symbol that existed in the spaces between fixed things, in the margin between one word and the next, in the silence between heartbeats. [308] It could not be found in any single text because it had been scattered deliberately across hundreds of volumes, encoded as cryptic messages left in library books by a long-dead order of truthseekers who had anticipated that impostors would one day walk among the thrones. [351] Each message was a fragment, and only when assembled would the rune reveal the true face beneath any mask. [370]

Maren had spent what might have been years or moments searching. [381] Time was meaningless here, measured only across the pause of shifting constellations visible through the library's shattered dome, stars that hung motionless in their slow rotation from one epoch to the next. [413] She moved from shelf to shelf, opening volumes of theology, astronomy, forgotten poetry, and finding in their margins the faint notations left by those truthseekers, written in iron gall ink that had oxidized to the color of old blood. [450]

She carried a single iron gall ink pellet of her own, dissolving fragments of it in water each night to transcribe the pieces she found. [475] The pellet shrank slowly, like a tiny dark moon waning, and she measured her progress by its diminishment. [494]

On what she sensed was the final night, Maren assembled the last fragment. [506] The rune materialized on the page before her, not as a fixed symbol but as something that drifted and shimmered, refusing to be pinned down, a truth that lived in motion. [537] She pressed her thumb to it and felt the library tremble. [548]

The rune would sunder the pretender's illusion, strip away every stolen face and borrowed gesture, but it would also sunder the architecture of deception that held the court together. [578] Maren understood this with terrible clarity. [584] The lords who had supported the false Sorath, the treaties signed under his fabricated authority, the alliances built on the foundation of a lie, all of it would collapse. [611]

She thought of her brother, the real Sorath, likely dead or imprisoned in some forgotten place. [627] She thought of the court that had not believed her. [637] She thought of the kingdom that would fracture when the truth was known. [650]

The rune drifted on the page, patient as the constellations overhead. [661]

Maren closed the book gently, tucked it beneath her arm, and walked toward the library's ancient threshold where the world waited, fragile and unsuspecting. [685] The collapse, when it came, would be graceful, she would make certain of that, each falling piece placed down softly, each broken thing acknowledged and mourned. [710]

She was small enough to move through the wreckage without crushing anything further. [723]

She stepped out of the pause and back into time, carrying the truth like a lantern into a house built of shadows. [745]
