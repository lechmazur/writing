The orchard grew sideways out of the cliff face, its trees jutting from limestone like broken fingers, and Maren hated every single one of them. [27]

She had not asked to tend cursed apple trees that wept black sap and bore fruit no living creature would eat. [48] She had not asked to inherit her grandmother's duty, the iron key, or the leather satchel of tools whose purposes she was still learning. [71] But the orchard sat at the heart of the cliffside labyrinth, and the labyrinth was the only passage between the highland villages and the winter harbor below, and someone had to keep the path lit for those who wandered in after dark. [108]

The mechanical birds made everything worse. [114] They perched on every ledge and cornice, brass-feathered sentinels installed by some forgotten engineer, their glass eyes clicking and tracking movement. [132] If you moved too quickly, they shrieked — a sound like a kettle being murdered — and their steel talons left gouges in the stone. [155] If you moved too slowly, they dove, herding you backward. [165] They recognized Maren only because she wore her grandmother's key on a chain around her neck, and even then they watched her with mechanical suspicion. [188]

Today she had found something new. [194] Wedged beneath the roots of the oldest tree, wrapped in oilcloth so degraded it crumbled at her breath, lay a sheaf of papers covered in precise architectural drawings. [220] A forgotten blueprint for the labyrinth itself — not just the paths as they existed now, but an entire lower level, sealed off, running directly to the harbor. [248] A safe passage that bypassed the switchbacks where travelers lost their footing in the dark and fell. [264]

Maren spread the pages on a flat stone and studied them with the offhandedly exact attention she gave to everything — never fussing, never second-guessing, just measuring the world with her eyes and arriving at the right number. [300] "Seventeen meters below the third terrace," she muttered, tracing a line. [311] "Ventilation shaft here. Staircase here. The birds wouldn't patrol it because they've got no perches mapped for that depth." [330]

She reached into her satchel and pulled out the small nut — not a fastener, but an actual hazelnut, black-shelled, harvested from the one non-apple tree the orchard had somehow tolerated. [361] Her grandmother had called them counting nuts. [368] You held one while you planned, turned it in your fingers, and when the plan was ready, you set it down on the blueprint to mark the starting point. [396] Maren turned the nut, thinking. [401]

The frost would come tonight. [406] She could feel it in the way the stone exhaled cold, in the way the mechanical birds had begun tucking their wings tighter, conserving whatever strange energy drove them. [433] Before the night frost formed, the labyrinth's wet stairs would become a death sentence for anyone still climbing. [449] Three families from Ashgrove were expected through before dawn. [458] Children among them. [461]

She had to assemble the lower passage. [468] Not build it — the blueprint showed it already existed, merely blocked by rubble and sealed doors. [483] She needed to clear the way, prop the doors, and leave markers. [495]

But the curse made direct contact dangerous. [502] Anything Maren touched with her bare hands inside the labyrinth, beyond the orchard's boundary stones, turned brittle and gray within hours. [521] Her grandmother had learned to work by leaving impressions without touching — using breath, sound, the weight of dropped tools, the heat of a lantern held close. [548] You pressed your intention into the world through every means except your skin. [561]

Maren set the nut on the blueprint's starting point and stood. [572]

She worked for four hours. [577] She used a pry bar wrapped in leather to shift rubble, her breath fogging in the deepening cold. [594] She kicked doors open with booted feet and hung lanterns from hooks by their wire handles. [609] She sang low notes that made the mechanical birds tilt their heads and — for reasons the forgotten engineer had perhaps intended — project thin beams of light from their glass eyes, illuminating the newly opened stairs. [645]

The passage was ugly. [649] The walls were rough, the steps uneven, the air tasted of minerals and old water. [664] But it descended true, exactly as the blueprint promised, and it emerged at the harbor shelf where salt air hit her face like a slap of grace. [691]

She climbed back up and waited at the labyrinth's upper mouth, lantern raised. [704] The frost came, painting the old switchbacks silver and lethal. [714] When the Ashgrove families appeared — bundles on their backs, children clinging to coat hems — Maren said nothing grand. [731]

"This way," she said. [735] "Watch the seventh step, it's narrow." [741]

She guided them down through the graceless beauty of the passage she had opened but never touched, and every single one of them arrived safe at the bottom, where the harbor lights burned gold against the black winter sea. [778]

Above, the mechanical birds settled on their perches and went still, and the cursed orchard creaked in the frost, and Maren's small nut sat on the blueprint like a period at the end of a sentence finally, fully written. [815]

I notice my count exceeded 800. Let me revise:
