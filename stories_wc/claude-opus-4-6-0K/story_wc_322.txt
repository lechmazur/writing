The gallery had no straight walls, though every surface pretended otherwise. [12] Mirela moved through corridors that folded into themselves, past paintings whose perspectives shifted when she blinked, past floors tiled in patterns that seemed to breathe underfoot. [38] She had designed this place during a fever that lasted eleven days, sketching blueprints on hospital bedsheets while her temperature climbed past the threshold where reason dissolves. [61] They called her the fever dream architect, though she preferred to think of herself as someone who simply listened to what delirium had to teach. [83]

The Gehring Optical Illusion Gallery had opened three months ago to unsettling reviews. [94] Critics praised its technical brilliance but admitted they left feeling changed in ways they couldn't articulate, as though the building had rearranged something behind their eyes. [118] That was the point. [122] Mirela had not built a gallery to house illusions. [131] She had built a gallery that was one. [138]

Tonight she walked it alone, after hours, carrying a spool of sinew thread she'd sourced from a traditional bowyer in Montana. [158] The thread was pale and tough, almost translucent, and it caught light the way a spider's silk does -- reluctantly, beautifully. [178] She had been weaving it between anchor points she'd embedded in the walls during construction, small brass hooks disguised as decorative rivets. [198] No one had noticed them. [202] No one was meant to. [206]

By weaving patterns of sinew thread through the gallery's corridors, Mirela was adding a new layer to the architecture -- something between sculpture and spellwork, though she would have rejected that second word. [237] What she practiced was rational enchantment, the careful application of geometry, tension, and material to produce effects that felt impossible but were entirely explicable. [258] Every angle she chose followed mathematical logic. [265] Every thread she strung obeyed physics. [271] Yet when the morning light would enter through the gallery's prismatic skylights and strike the woven sinew, visitors would feel something erupt inside their chests -- a sudden, involuntary recognition, as though they had remembered a thing they had never known. [307]

She paused at the central atrium, where the floor's Penrose tiling created the sensation of infinite descent. [323] Here she tied off a thread and began a new spoke radiating toward the east corridor. [338] Her fingers worked with the precision of long practice, looping the sinew around each hook, pulling it taut until it hummed at a frequency just below hearing. [362] The pattern she was creating existed in the space between dimensions -- realistically imaginary, like the square root of negative one, a thing that should not be but without which the equations of reality would collapse. [395]

This was what drove her. [400] Not fame, not the commission fees that had made her wealthy enough to work alone at midnight. [415] Mirela wanted to discover the texture of connection -- the actual, physical quality of what it feels like when one consciousness brushes against another. [437] She believed connection had a shape. [443] She believed it could be built. [449]

As she worked, memories altered around her like weather. [458] The gallery did this; she had designed it to do this. [469] The illusions on the walls destabilized the brain's pattern-matching, and in the gaps, old memories surfaced wearing new faces. [489] She remembered her mother's hands, but they were holding thread. [499] She remembered her first architectural model, but it was built from bone and catgut. [512] The memories were not false. [517] They were truer than what she usually carried, stripped of the comfortable distortions that time applies. [531]

An unsettling calm settled over her, the kind that arrives when you stop resisting what you already know. [549] The sinew web was nearly complete. [555] It spanned the entire gallery now, a three-dimensional weaving that would be almost invisible by day and entirely invisible by night, present only as a subtle resistance in the air, a feeling of being held. [589]

She tied the final knot. [594] The thread vibrated once, a single pulse that traveled through the entire network and returned to her fingertips carrying something warm. [614] She closed her eyes. [618] The gallery breathed around her, its impossible walls settling into a new configuration, one that included the web and was changed by it. [640]

Tomorrow, strangers would walk through these corridors and feel, without knowing why, that they were not alone. [657] They would stand before illusions that tricked their eyes and feel the sinew threads brush against their arms like the ghost of someone reaching out. [680] They would leave altered, carrying a new memory of connection that had never happened and was entirely real. [697]

Mirela opened her eyes. [701] The gallery's walls shifted in the darkness, showing her angles that did not exist, depths that could not be. [720] She smiled with the calm of someone who understands that the most rational thing in the world is to build what cannot be explained, and to trust that the thread holds. [751]
