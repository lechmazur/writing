The hydraulics failed on a Tuesday, and after that, everything at the signal station ran on starlight and stubbornness. [21]

Maren had been the patchwork navigator for eleven years, stitching together routes from dead satellites, decommissioned radio towers, and hand-drawn charts she bartered from fishermen who no longer fished. [46] Her title was unofficial, bestowed by the handful of people who still passed through the station on their way back to places that had already forgotten them. [69] Reverse migration, the government called it -- the slow, illogical return of displaced populations to ruined coastlines, poisoned valleys, towns half-swallowed by sand. [89] Maren called it something else. [94] She called it the geography of loss, and she had made it her life's work to navigate it. [111]

The signal station sat on a ridge where three dead highways converged, its old hydraulic antenna array now frozen at a forty-degree angle, pointing at nothing useful. [137] Without hydraulics, the dish couldn't track or transmit. [146] So Maren decided to build. [151] She scavenged parts from the station's basement -- corroded circuit boards, lengths of copper wire, a hand-crank generator that screamed like a cat when turned. [174] She constructed a new antenna from the skeleton of the old one, something ugly and asymmetric that looked like it had been assembled by a desperate mind, which it had. [203]

On her workbench, holding down a stack of frequency charts, sat a patina bronze censer foot -- heavy, green-black with age, shaped like a lion's paw clutching an orb. [232] It had belonged to her mother, who had carried it out of their hometown when the floods came, gripping it like a talisman while everything else washed away. [258] Her mother was one of the reverse migrants now, part of the current flowing backward toward obliterated homes, and Maren hadn't heard from her in nine months. [284]

Until the phone calls started. [289]

They came at midnight, always midnight, the station's landline ringing with a sound that seemed to rise from underground. [307] The voice on the other end was never her mother's, not exactly. [319] It was a woman who spoke in fragments -- coordinates disguised as Bible verses, compass headings embedded in nursery rhymes, place names whispered like confessions. [340] Cryptic, maddening, but consistent. [345] Maren transcribed every word, pinning the decoded locations to her wall map with colored tacks. [359]

A pattern emerged. [362] The calls came stronger during the full moon and faded to static whispers during the new moon, the signal fluctuating with moon phases as though tethered to tidal forces Maren couldn't see. [392] She learned to plan around it, staying awake through the brightest nights, recording everything, sleeping through the dark ones when the line went dead. [415]

The tacks on her map traced a route. [423] It wound south along the ruined coast, through the contamination zones, past the abandoned checkpoints, and terminated at a town whose name Maren recognized with a physical ache: Colmar. [449] Home. [450] Or what had been home before the water took it. [460]

She understood then. [463] The calls weren't guidance for the migrants passing through her station. [473] They were guidance for her. [478]

On the last night of the full moon, the phone rang and the voice said, clear as anything: "The censer is missing its foot." [500] Then silence. [503]

Maren picked up the bronze paw from her workbench. [512] She turned it over in her hands, feeling its weight, its impossible solidity, the way it anchored her to a woman she was afraid she'd already lost. [538] She packed it into her bag alongside the frequency charts, the hand-crank generator, and a canteen of clean water. [556]

She left the signal station under a sky so thick with stars it looked like static. [571] The new antenna she'd built hummed behind her, broadcasting a looping message for anyone who wandered in: coordinates, safe water sources, shelter locations. [593] Her patchwork knowledge, stitched into the airwaves for strangers. [602]

The road south was dark and broken, but Maren had spent eleven years reading broken things. [617] She followed the route the midnight voice had drawn, stepping into the geography of loss not to map it for others but to finally walk it herself. [644]

The bronze foot was warm against her hip. [652] The moon was waning, and soon the voice would go quiet, but Maren had enough coordinates to carry her the rest of the way. [675] Somewhere ahead, in a drowned town reassembling itself from memory and mud, her mother was waiting with a censer that needed its missing piece. [699]

And Maren, who had spent years helping others find their way back, was finally building the road to her own raw and necessary homecoming. [722]
