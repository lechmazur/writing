The mangrove labyrinth breathed at night, its roots twisting through black water like the fingers of something that had forgotten how to let go. [27] Lira poled her flatboat through the narrow channels, listening to the spirits sing from the canopy—long, wordless melodies that tangled in the aerial roots and hung there like Spanish moss made of sound. [56] She had come here because Maren told her to, and Maren was a cryptic medium who never explained anything fully, who spoke in fragments the way a shattered mirror still reflects but only in pieces. [84]

"Find the shard before the moon finds you," Maren had said, pressing a sealed envelope into Lira's hands. [100] "And don't read this until you're ready to send what you've never sent." [113]

Lira had fourteen unsent letters in a waterproof pouch strapped against her ribs. [125] Fourteen apologies to her sister Cael, written over fourteen months, each one started with fury and ended with something she couldn't name. [145] She had never mailed them because mailing them would mean choosing—choosing to be the one who broke first, the one who admitted that the silence between them was a wound she had helped open. [176] She existed now in the space where an apology waits unspoken, that liminal breath between knowing you were wrong and saying it aloud. [198]

The spirits' singing shifted, lower now, a hum that vibrated through the water and up through the pole into her hands. [218] She followed the sound deeper into the labyrinth, where the mangroves grew so thick their canopy blotted out everything except thin threads of moonlight. [240] There, wedged between two roots at the waterline, she found it: a gargoyle's rainspout shard, broken from some cathedral that had no business existing in a swamp. [265] It was stone carved into an open mouth, dark with age, trailing green algae like a beard. [281]

When she touched it, moonlight found the gap in the canopy and struck the shard, and she watched the stone heal—a crack along the jaw sealed itself, the pitted surface smoothed, the mouth becoming whole again as though remembering its original shape. [318] The shard healed in moonlight, and Lira understood with a fierce tenderness that almost buckled her knees: some broken things only needed to be held in the right light. [346]

She carried the shard back to the flatboat and set it on the bow. [360] The spirits sang louder, and condensation gathered on the shard's surface in the humid air. [375] No—not just condensation. [378] Words. [379] Letters formed in the moisture beading on the stone, messages appearing and dissolving like breath on a winter window. [395] She read them as fast as they appeared. [402]

"I waited for you at the hospital." [409] "You never came." [412] "I forgive you anyway." [416]

Cael's voice, channeled through stone and spirit and swamp water. [426] Maren's cryptic gift—not prophecy but a bridge, a medium's method of translating what the living couldn't say to each other face to face. [448] The condensation kept forming words, kept delivering messages that Cael had never spoken aloud either, her own unsent letters written in water vapor. [470]

"I was afraid you didn't come because you didn't care." [481] "Tell me that's not true." [487]

Lira pulled the waterproof pouch open with shaking hands. [496] Fourteen letters, fourteen attempts to say what the condensation was asking her to answer. [509] She didn't need to choose the perfect one. [517] She needed to find the moment before deciding—the raw, unpolished instant before pride or shame could intervene. [533]

She picked up the earliest letter, the angriest one, the one that ended mid-sentence with "but I still—" [550] That dash contained everything. [554] She held it against the shard and watched the moonlight pass through the paper, watched the spirits' song evoke something from the ink—not just words but the feeling beneath them, the fierce tenderness of someone who writes fury because love is too frightening to lead with. [593]

The condensation on the stone shifted one final time. [602]

"Come home." [604]

Lira folded the letter and slid it into the gargoyle's open mouth, that ancient stone throat that had once channeled rain from sacred heights. [625] It would carry her words where she had been too proud to send them. [637] Around her the mangrove labyrinth opened, roots parting, channels widening, the spirits singing something that sounded almost like her sister's laugh. [656]

She picked up the pole and turned the flatboat toward open water, toward the place where the swamp met the river met the road that led to Cael's door. [685] The moon followed her out, healing every shadow it touched. [695]

She still had thirteen letters in the pouch. [703] She would deliver them all by hand. [710]
