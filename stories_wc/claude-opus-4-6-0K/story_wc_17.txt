The ivy had grown so thick after the climate shifts that Maren had to cut her way through it with a machete just to reach the entrance of the old university's east wing. [33] No one came here anymore. [38] The corridors had been abandoned when the flooding seasons began, when the temperature swings cracked foundations and drove people north toward the domed settlements. [58] But Maren was a corridor echo cartographer, one of the last practitioners of a discipline most people considered either useless or mad, and she had come because the walls were calling. [88]

Her work involved mapping the acoustic signatures of abandoned hallways -- the way sound folded and rebounded through empty spaces, creating patterns that, she believed, revealed something about the structures themselves. [114] Not just their architecture, but their memory. [120] She called it listening for what walls dream about, and she'd spent eleven years chasing that answer through derelict hospitals, collapsed metro tunnels, and flooded cathedrals. [143]

The ivy-veiled passage before her exhaled cold air that smelled of char and rain. [157] She stepped inside, her boots crunching on a carpet of dried leaves and plaster dust, and felt the familiar compression of silence that meant the acoustics here were extraordinary. [183] She tapped her tuning rod against the wall and listened as the tone spiraled away into the dark, returning to her in layered whispers. [205] She closed her eyes. [209] The echo told her things: the corridor bent left ahead, opened into a high-ceilinged room, then narrowed again. [225] But beneath the spatial information was something else, a resonance she'd never encountered, as if the building were vibrating at a frequency just below grief. [248]

She followed the echo deeper. [253]

Her mother had been a corridor echo cartographer too. [262] That was the part Maren never spoke about. [269] Eloise Voss had pioneered the discipline, had written the foundational texts, had mapped over two hundred structures before disappearing into this very building sixteen years ago, just before the first catastrophic climate shift turned the region into a swampland. [304] Maren carried her mother's legacy like a stone sewn into her chest -- the burden of continuing work that the world dismissed, that had consumed the woman who'd invented it, that might consume her too. [336]

The high-ceilinged room turned out to be a former lecture hall, its tiered seats buried under collapsed ceiling panels. [353] At the far end, a fireplace gaped black and cold. [363] Maren crouched before it and found what the fire had not fully taken: half-burned diaries, their edges laced with ash, their pages curled but still partially legible. [389] She recognized her mother's handwriting immediately. [396]

Through the half-burned diaries, she began to piece together Eloise's final months. [407] Her mother had been mapping this building obsessively, convinced that its acoustic signature contained a pattern identical to human neural oscillations during dreaming. [425] The walls don't just remember, Eloise had written. [433] They process. [435] They imagine. [437] The next page was mostly ash, but Maren could make out: I am close to proving it, and then, further down: I am afraid of what the proof means. [462]

Tucked between the diary's back pages, Maren found a film negative strip, warped by heat but intact enough to hold up to the pale light filtering through the ivy. [492] She glimpsed, in the reversed tones of the negative, a series of acoustic waveform photographs -- her mother's echo maps rendered visually. [513] The patterns were unmistakable. [517] They looked like the dendritic branching of neurons. [524] They looked like thought. [528]

Maren sat on the floor of the lecture hall for a long time. [541] She was sensitively perceptive in ways that made the world unbearable sometimes -- she felt the weight of spaces, the emotional residue of rooms, the particular sadness of a place where someone had worked alone and desperately toward a truth no one else wanted. [577] She felt her mother here, not as a ghost but as an echo, the kind she'd spent her life mapping. [596]

The burden of legacy was not that it demanded continuation. [606] It was that it demanded choice. [612] Maren could walk away, seal this building back beneath its ivy, let her mother's discovery stay buried. [627] Or she could carry it forward, knowing it might brand her with the same obsession, the same isolation. [643]

She pressed her palm flat against the wall. [651] It was cool and faintly trembling, the way a sleeping body trembles. [662] She tapped her tuning rod once more and listened to the echo return, layered and strange and alive with something she could almost understand. [683]

She packed the diaries and the film strip carefully into her bag. [694] Then she stood, adjusted her equipment, and walked deeper into the corridor, following the sound of whatever the walls were dreaming. [714]
