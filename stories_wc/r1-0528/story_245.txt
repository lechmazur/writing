Jogging across the abandoned spaceport flight deck, Kael's boots crunched on fractured permacrete, each step echoing the simmering fury in his chest. <words>25</words>
He was irate, a smuggler grounded by betrayal, his usual routes choked by rivals who’d sold him out for a pittance. <words>42</words>
His motivation wasn't profit now, but a desperate, almost absurd need: to find the hidden waterfalls rumored to cascade down the sheer cliffs beyond the derelict starport perimeter. <words>67</words>
They represented escape, purity, a roar to drown out the bitter taste of treachery; finding them felt like his only remaining purpose. <words>85</words>
Sweat stung his eyes, mixing with the biting sincerity of his self-loathing – he’d trusted fools, and it cost him everything but the clothes on his back and the single, lacquered chopstick jammed into his pocket. <words>113</words>
That chopstick, snapped from its pair during the frantic escape that left his partner dead, was a jagged reminder of loss, a useless relic he couldn't bring himself to discard. <words>136</words>
Reaching a relatively sheltered alcove beneath a listing cargo gantry, Kael stopped, lungs burning, the heart's revolt within him a palpable, abstractly physical thing – a pressure behind his ribs, a metallic tang on his tongue, a vibration in his clenched fists that felt separate from his own pulse. <words>173</words>
It wasn't just anger; it was his core screaming against the cage of his circumstances, a raw, primal refusal to accept this ruin as his end. <words>194</words>
He pulled a small, dented thermos from his pack, the last dregs of cheap, bitter tea swirling inside. <words>209</words>
He needed to memorialize his partner, Lys, not with grand gestures in this graveyard of ships, but in a way that felt true to their shared, hidden moments. <words>232</words>
Pouring the dark liquid into the thermos cap, he watched the leaves settle, the method clear in his mind: through patterns in tea leaves, like Lys used to read fortunes in portside dives, finding stories in the chaos. <words>262</words>
Kael swirled the cup, his breath ragged from the run, and drained it, leaving the dregs clinging to the white plastic. <words>280</words>
He stared into the residue, the patterns resolving not into a face or a name, but into a distinct, undeniable shape: a single, perfect waterfall, cascading down the curve of the cup. <words>304</words>
It wasn't Lys's face, but a sign, a confirmation etched in bitter leaves. <words>318</words>
The heart's revolt quieted, replaced by a cold, focused certainty. <words>330</words>
The hidden falls were real; Lys, in her cryptic way, was pointing the path. <words>344</words>
Kael touched the single chopstick in his pocket, its smooth wood warm against his fingers. <words>358</words>
He wouldn't just find the falls; he'd survive, fueled by memory and the biting sincerity of his vengeance, a smuggler turned hunter in the ruins. <words>381</words>
The abandoned deck stretched before him, silent and vast, but Kael was no longer running aimlessly; he had a bearing, written in tea leaves and grief. <words>406</words>
He started jogging again, this time towards the perimeter fence and the cliffs beyond, the chopstick a silent promise carried towards the roar of water. <words>429</words>
