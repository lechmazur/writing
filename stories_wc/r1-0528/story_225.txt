<story>
The wayward apothecary, Silas Thorne, hunched over the brass eyepiece of the submarine's observation dome, his fingers stained with forgotten tinctures. <words>20</words>
Outside the thick quartz, in the crushing indigo depths lit only by the sub's flickering searchlights, the impossible happened: a shimmering river of Celestial Sapphire butterflies pulsed through the abyss, their bioluminescent wings casting an unjustly fair glow against the perpetual twilight. <words>50</words>
He was here, aboard the battered marvel of the *Nautilus Redux*, a steampunk leviathan groaning with every pressure shift, to track their migration, a secret pilgrimage occurring precisely between broken treaties that had plunged the surface world into silent, simmering conflict. <words>80</words>
His motivation wasn't scientific curiosity, but a promise whispered to Elara, whose fascination with these deep-sea migrants had bordered on obsession before the political frost silenced her. <words>105</words>
A dry highlighter pen, useless for its intended purpose but salvaged from Elara's research notes, lay cold in his pocket, a tangible ghost of her presence. <words>125</words>
Suddenly, the *Redux* shuddered violently; a distress klaxon, muffled by the thick water, wailed from a crippled companion vessel sinking fast into the trench below, its hull breached by a territorial depth-leviathan. <words>155</words>
Desperation clawed at Silas; conventional comms were jammed, the treaties' collapse ensuring no rescue would come. <words>170</words>
Elaraâ€™s voice echoed in his memory: *"They communicate, Silas, light to light... like Morse in the dark."* <words>185</words>
An insane, beautiful idea sparked. <words>189</words>
He snatched the dry highlighter, its fluorescent yellow tip dull but intact, and scrambled to the dome's external signal lamp, a massive carbide beacon. <words>210</words>
Working its stiff plunger with frantic precision, Silas used the brief bursts of yellow light not to illuminate, but to signal. <words>230</words>
He began to infect the abyss with hope, tapping out Morse code through the highlighter pen's weak, stuttering beam directly into the path of the migrating butterflies. <words>255</words>
*Dot... Dash... Dot...* "SOS" pulsed into the gloom, carried on the rhythmic undulation of a thousand sapphire wings. <words>275</words>
The butterflies, sensing the familiar pulse of light communication, amplified the signal instinctively, their collective glow brightening and dimming in perfect sync with Silas's desperate taps, transforming the migrating swarm into a living, deep-sea telegraph wire. <words>310</words>
His unconventional love for Elara, a force as persistent and inexplicable as butterflies thriving in the crushing deep, fueled each precise, aching movement. <words>335</words>
Across leagues of dark water, aboard another sub drawn by the anomalous, rhythmic bioluminescence, a signalman squinted at his hydrophone display. <words>360</words>
"Captain... it's Morse! Faint, but clear... repeating 'SOS'... and it's... coming from the butterflies?" <words>380</words>
Silas slumped against the cold brass, the dry highlighter finally spent, watching as the *Redux*'s searchlights joined the sapphire river, guiding the rescue craft through the political and oceanic darkness. <words>410</words>
In the battered marvel of the submarine, amidst broken treaties and crushing pressure, love had found its frequency. <words>430</words>
