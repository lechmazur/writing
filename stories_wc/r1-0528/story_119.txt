The revelation struck Lena like a physical blow: the shadow entity *knew* she was an astral projector, and it was hunting her *now*. <words>25</words> Her practiced spontaneity kicked in; survival instincts, honed over years of navigating both the physical and astral planes, demanded immediate flight from the skeletal remains of the carnival's roller coaster track where she'd been scouting. <words>58</words> The antique brass key, cold against her palm where she clutched it tight, was her only tangible link to the hidden sanctuary she desperately needed to reach. <words>85</words> Unyielding compassion, that core drive which sometimes always compelled her to aid lost souls even at great personal risk, warred with the primal urge for self-preservation. <words>112</words> This time, preserving her own survival skills – the very abilities allowing her to help others – was paramount; she couldn't let the entity consume her light. <words>138</words> She dropped low, scrambling between rusted steel supports, her movements fluid and decisive despite the terror. <words>157</words> The late afternoon sun cast long, sharp shadows across the decaying park, and Lena knew her method: she would flee by tracking sun shadows, using their shifting angles and elongating forms as a map and shield against the entity's gaze. <words>193</words> Moving from one patch of deep shade to the next, she flowed like quicksilver over the buckled asphalt, the key a reassuring weight. <words>213</words> The entity's cold presence slithered nearby, a pressure against her mind, but Lena focused on the geometry of darkness painted by the dying light. <words>237</words> Ahead, the shadow of a colossal, crumbling clown head pointed like a sundial towards a service tunnel entrance half-buried under debris. <words>259</words> That was her goal, the sanctuary's threshold. <words>268</words> Reaching the tunnel mouth, Lena fumbled with the antique brass key, its intricate wards humming faintly under her touch. <words>289</words> The entity coalesced behind her, a vortex of chilling darkness reaching out. <words>303</words> Her unyielding compassion flared – not towards the predator, but towards the countless others she could yet save if she survived this. <words>326</words> The key slid home, turned with a resonant *click* that seemed to vibrate through the metal frame. <words>346</words> She threw herself into the welcoming gloom beyond the door just as the shadow's grasping tendrils scraped against the threshold, barred by ancient protections activated by the key. <words>376</words> Leaning against the cold tunnel wall, gasping, Lena knew the chase was far from over, but for these precious seconds, she was safe, her skills and her purpose preserved. <words>404</words> The sanctuary's quiet hum enveloped her, a stark contrast to the decaying frenzy outside. <words>422</words>
