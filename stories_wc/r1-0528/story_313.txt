The dust of the dystopian farm clung to Silas’s threadbare coat, a gritty testament to his latest failure. <words>20</words>
His latest con, selling "miracle" drought-resistant seeds that were just painted pebbles, had collapsed faster than the withered cornstalks surrounding the derelict barn he now hid in. <words>42</words>
The only thing left in his pockets was an empty tape dispenser, its plastic wheel spinning uselessly, a mocking reminder of promises he couldn't stick to anymore. <words>64</words>
Silas slumped against the splintered wood, the silence of the dead farm pressing in, and felt the insidious lull of remorse begin to seep into his bones, a heavy fatigue whispering of all the lives he’d ruined. <words>91</words>
He needed to fight it, to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin, to prove he wasn't beaten yet, even here, even now. <words>108</words>
"Alright," he muttered with a mild fervor, a spark of defiance in his weary eyes, "who's haunting this dump?" <words>125</words>
He focused, drawing on a knack he rarely admitted to, a method born of desperation: interrogating ghostly apparitions. <words>142</words>
The air shimmered, and figures coalesced – not terrifying specters, but farmers, their forms translucent and shimmering under the weak light filtering through the barn's broken roof. <words>166</words>
Their faces held a profound, unsettlingly placid acceptance, an unusually normal expression for ghosts trapped in such a blighted place. <words>185</words>
"Tell me," Silas demanded, pushing down his own creeping despair, "how do you stand it? <words>199</words>
The ruin, the failure... doesn't it eat at you?" <words>207</words>
The nearest ghost, an old man with spectral overalls, tilted his head. <words>218</words>
"Failed?" he echoed, his voice like wind through dry husks. <words>228</words>
"We tended the land as long as breath remained. <words>237</words>
The drought wasn't our doing, nor the corporation's poison in the soil. <words>249</words>
We did what we could, with what we had. <words>258</words>
Where is the failure in that?" <words>265</words>
Another ghost, a woman holding the faint outline of a child's hand, added, "Remorse is for choices, not circumstance. <words>282</words>
We chose to stay, to try. <words>289</words>
You chose... differently." <words>294</words>
Her words, simple and direct, struck Silas harder than any accusation. <words>307</words>
Their quiet dignity, their lack of bitterness, was a mirror reflecting his own hollow choices. <words>322</words>
The lull of remorse deepened, threatening to pull him under completely. <words>334</words>
He wasn't like them; he'd *chosen* the easy path, the deceptive win. <words>347</words>
He clutched the useless tape dispenser, its emptiness a physical weight. <words>359</words>
"Then... how?" he rasped, the defiance bleeding out, replaced by a raw need he couldn't name. <words>374</words>
"How did you... live with it?" <words>381</words>
The old ghost’s form seemed to soften. <words>388</words>
"By finding comfort," he said gently, "in the sunrise we didn't see, in the memory of good soil, in knowing we faced it together. <words>408</words>
Comfort isn't in avoiding the storm, boy, but in remembering you weathered others." <words>421</words>
Silas looked at the ghosts, then at the barren land visible through the barn door, then at the empty dispenser in his hand. <words>441</word>
A strange, quiet resolve settled over him, not a grin at defeat, but the first step towards something else entirely. <words>459</words>
