<story>
The cheerless duelist trudged through the abandoned spaceport customs office, his boots crunching on shattered data-slates under the flickering emergency lights. <words>19</words>
Amid the hum of server rooms, a persistent mechanical drone that felt like the ghost of interstellar bureaucracy, he sought the maggoty wooden chest that rattled with a promise he dreaded. <words>42</words>
It contained his family’s legacy, twisted by generations of pride and secrecy into something grotesque. <words>55</words>
His fatal flaw, he knew, was the same cold rigidity that had turned his ancestors’ culinary alchemy into weapons, a flaw crystallized when he’d killed his own brother in a duel over stolen honor. <words>79</words>
Now, motivated by a desperate need to learn the power of forgiveness before his soul petrified entirely, he pried open the chest, recoiling at the squirming larvae within and the sharp scent of decay. <words>105</words>
Inside lay brittle parchments inscribed with family recipes, but centuries of isolation and radiation had caused unexpected mutations of those recipes, transforming instructions for saffron-infused broth into formulae for temporal elasticity. <words>130</words>
One precisely innovative formula, its measurements exact down to the atomic level, described how to elasticize moments of regret, stretching them thin enough to revisit and reshape. <words>153</words>
He gathered the components listed: powdered stardust from a broken customs scanner, coolant fluid siphoned from a dead server, and the iridescent carapaces of the chest’s own maggots, grinding them into a shimmering paste. <words>182</words>
Applying the paste to his temples in the gloom, he felt time warp and buckle around him, the office walls seeming to breathe. <words>199</words>
He was flung back to the rain-slicked plaza where he’d faced his brother, feeling the familiar surge of defensive fury, but the elasticized moment allowed hesitation, a fractional pause where none existed before. <words>227</words>
In that stretched second, he saw not an opponent’s sneer, but his brother’s fear, the same fear that had once made him share stolen sweets beneath their mother’s table. <words>250</words>
The duelist’s rigid arm, trained for lethal speed, trembled; his blade dipped, etching only a shallow line across his brother’s tunic instead of piercing his heart. <words>274</words>
Returning to the present in the derelict office, the hum of servers now a mournful dirge, he cradled the empty chest, its rattling ceased. <words>295</words>
His brother lived in this altered thread, estranged but breathing, and the bittersweet reckoning washed over him: forgiveness wasn’t absolution granted, but a weight elasticized into something bearable, woven from mutated chance and remembered kindness. <words>329</words>
He had not erased his flaw, but he had stretched its confines, allowing light into the cracks of his cheerless existence. <words>346</words>
The abandoned spaceport, with its dead technology and lingering hum, felt less like a tomb and more like a silent witness to his fragile, hard-won peace. <words>369</words>
He left the maggoty chest behind, a relic of the past, and walked into the starlight filtering through the cracked dome, carrying only the elasticized memory of mercy. <words>392</word>
