<story>
Sir Alistair, once a knight of radiant renown, now bore the mantle of a dejected knight, his armor dulled by ash and regret. <words>19</words>
Clutched in his gauntleted fist was the cold, coral-encrusted trident prong from a sunken realm, a relic humming with forgotten power. <words>37</words>
His quest, born of a failure that haunted his dreams, was to voice a silent vow echoing through ages, a promise to a queen swallowed by the sea. <words>59</words>
The path led him now, guided by the prong's subtle pulse, through forgotten paths choked with luminous, time-lost ivy. <words>74</words>
He emerged not onto solid ground, but into the shimmering, sacred disorder of a zero-gravity dance hall, where bodies pirouetted silently in the air. <words>94</words>
Here, the laws of physics bent; floating was the normally abnormal state, a defiance of gravity that felt both holy and chaotic. <words>114</words>
High above, embedded in the cavernous hall's crystalline ceiling, an ancient watchtower clock, its face cracked but still turning, began to chime. <words>134</words>
It struck not twelve, nor one, but an unexpected hour – thirteen – a sound like fractured bells resonating through the vast space. <words>154</words>
At the thirteenth chime, the trident prong flared with aquamarine light, its energy seeming to quicken the very air around Alistair. <words>174</words>
His pulse began to quicken in response, matching the prong's rhythm, a drumbeat against the silence of the floating dancers. <words>193</words>
The horizons within the hall seemed to deepen, the walls receding into star-flecked voids, revealing constellations unknown to surface dwellers. <words>213</words>
This deepening horizons effect pulled at Alistair's resolve, threatening to dissolve him into the cosmic expanse. <words>231</words>
He focused on the prong, its connection to the drowned queen, his vow – a shield against the dissolving dark. <words>249</words>
One dancer, ethereal and trailing stardust, drifted close; her eyes held the depth of the ocean trench. <words>267</words>
The trident prong vibrated fiercely, recognizing the echo of its lost sovereign within her spectral form. <words>285</words>
This was the moment, the unexpected hour demanding fulfillment. <words>296</words>
Alistair raised the prong, its light intensifying, casting long, dancing shadows. <words>311</words>
He drew breath, the sacred disorder of the weightless hall amplifying his voice, making it resonate with the weight of millennia. <words>331</words>
"Queen Lyra," his voice boomed, clear and strong, shattering the silent ballet, "I voice the vow! Your realm endures! Your legacy is not forgotten!" <words>354</words>
The words, the silent vow echoing through ages finally voiced, hung tangible in the air. <words>370</words>
The spectral dancer smiled, a gesture that seemed to calm the chaotic currents. <words>386</words>
The watchtower clock ceased its unexpected chime. <words>395</words>
The deepening horizons stabilized, the starry voids receding as the hall's true, albeit impossible, dimensions solidified. <words>414</words>
The trident prong's light dimmed, its purpose served, its connection to the sunken realm momentarily appeased. <words>433</words>
Alistair, the dejection lifting like a physical weight, felt the zero-gravity release him gently back towards the forgotten path. <words>454</words>
He stepped back onto the luminous ivy, the sacred disorder fading behind him, replaced by a profound, earned peace. <words>475</words>
