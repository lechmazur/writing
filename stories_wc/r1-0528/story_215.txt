Father Aris Thorne adjusted his collar, the tang of ozone and old incense clinging to his cassock as he navigated the sterile corridors of the Psionics Institute. <words>25</words>
Amid the muffled thump of dance lessons bleeding from a nearby studio – cha-cha-cha, one-two-three – his fingers trembled around a faded, sepia-toned vintage postcard depicting the very facility decades prior. <words>49</words>
"Received anonymously," he muttered, the image a silent accusation; its arrival had coincided with the unsettling phenomena plaguing Lab Gamma. <words>67</words>
Inwardly social yet outwardly withdrawn since the St. Claire incident, Aris craved connection but trusted only protocols and data, a rattled exorcist adrift in a sea of EEGs and EM sensors. <words>90</words>
His motivation was pure, if desperate: to entwine science with wonder, proving the phenomena weren't mere hallucinations but quantifiable energies, a bridge between his faith and their skepticism. <words>115</words>
Dr. Elara Vance intercepted him, her smile sharp as a scalpel, radiating coy aggression. <words>126</words>
"Still chasing ghosts, Father?" she purred, tapping the postcard. <words>133</words>
"Or perhaps the ghosts are chasing you? Lab Gamma’s readings remain... inconclusive." <words>142</words>
Her guarded disclosures were a familiar dance, revealing just enough to unsettle, never enough to confirm. <words>155</words>
Aris knew she knew more. <words>159</words>
The postcard held the first clue: a constellation overlay visible only under UV light from a lab scanner, pointing to a disused storage room. <words>178</words>
Inside, amidst dusty crates labeled 'Spectral Resonance Project - Classified', he found a series of puzzles: a locked cabinet requiring a frequency hummed at a specific pitch, a wall panel responding only to focused bio-thermal signatures, a final cipher based on the dance steps echoing down the hall. <words>218</words>
Each solved puzzle felt like peeling back a layer of Elara’s calculated ambiguity, forcing guarded disclosures from the environment itself. <words>235</words>
Sweat beaded on Aris's brow, the rhythmic dance beats a counterpoint to his racing heart as he manipulated the final mechanism. <words>251</words>
A section of wall slid back with a hiss, revealing a hidden room bathed in the cold glow of dormant instruments. <words>269</words>
At its center pulsed a containment unit humming with captured, swirling light – raw psychic energy made manifest. <words>285</words>
Elara’s voice slithered from the doorway, "Impressive synthesis, Father. <words>293</words>
You've connected the dots, merged faith and frequency. <words>299</words>
But did you synthesize *why*?" <words>304</words>
Her coy aggression hardened. <words>307</words>
"This energy isn't residual; it's a beacon. <words>313</words>
And you just amplified the signal." <words>318</words>
The rattled exorcist stared at the captured wonder, the vintage postcard suddenly a dire warning, not an invitation. <words>336</words>
The dance music outside faltered, replaced by a chilling, resonant silence. <words>347</words>
He had entwined science with wonder, alright, but the cost shimmered dangerously in the air, thick and electric. <words>365</words>
Elara’s smile didn’t reach her eyes. <words>369</words>
"Welcome to the real experiment, Father Thorne. <words>375</words>
The subject always synthesizes the trap." <words>380</words>
The swirling light within the containment unit flared violently, casting long, predatory shadows. <words>394</words>
Aris braced himself, the protocols useless now, the true haunting just beginning. <words>407</word>
The dance was over; the hunt was on. <words>413</words>
