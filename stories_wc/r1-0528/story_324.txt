<story>
In the hush of a simmering future, Agent Silas paced the sterile chrome corridors of Section Gamma, the agency's most clandestine secret agent headquarters. <words>20</words>
His reflection warped in the polished surfaces, mirroring his own insecure advisor status, perpetually doubting his analyses for Director Vance. <words>36</words>
The rumor consumed him: whispers of Project Echo, a weaponized resonance capable of shattering minds, hidden somewhere beyond the city limits. <words>56</words>
It was a clearly ambiguous lead, lacking coordinates or verifiable sources, yet Silas felt compelled to chase it beyond all reason, a compulsion he couldn't rationalize. <words>79</words>
His motivation wasn't duty, but a desperate, gnawing need to prove his worth, to silence the internal critic that whispered 'fraud' with every report. <words>100</words>
He stopped before a sealed vault door, his access chip granting entry to a chamber humming with low-level containment fields. <words>118</words>
Inside, bathed in an eerie blue light, sat the object of his clandestine research: a human brain suspended in viscous fluid, the jar crisply labeled 'DUPLICATE'. <words>142</words>
Was it a backup? A clone? The official file was redacted; its existence itself was a fracture in the agency's idyllic facade of control. <words>164</words>
This fractured idyll extended to Silas's own psyche, the sterile perfection of Gamma contrasting violently with his internal chaos. <words>185</words>
He believed the Duplicate held fragmented memories, echoes perhaps, of the original mind's final mission near the abandoned Sector 7 listening post. <words>208</words>
Accessing its bio-neural interface was forbidden, but Silas, driven by the dreamer's calling – that irrational pull towards hidden truths – saw no other path. <words>232</words>
He initiated the link, a jolt of static flaring across the monitors as the Duplicate's dormant patterns flickered. <words>251</words>
Instead of coherent data, he received sensory fragments: cold metal, stale air, and the distinct, hollow echo of footsteps pacing on concrete. <words>272</words>
The method was indirect, maddening; he was perceiving the present through the echo of footsteps in an abandoned place, relayed via the Duplicate's residual connection. <words>297</words>
Someone *was* in Sector 7, moving with purpose through the derelict halls, their presence confirming the rumor was terrifyingly real. <words>319</words>
Frustration and fear coiled in Silas's gut; the echo was constant, rhythmic, a taunting reminder of his physical distance from the truth. <words>341</words>
In a sudden surge of impotent rage, he slammed his fist down, not on the console, but on the reinforced glass of the jar itself – a sharp, stupid jab. <words>365</words>
The fluid sloshed violently; the brain tissue shuddered, and the neural feed erupted into blinding static. <words>383</words>
When it cleared, the echo was gone, replaced by a single, overwhelming psychic impression: not fear, but profound, melancholic longing. <words>405</words>
It was the dreamer's calling, emanating not from Silas, but resonating from the Duplicate itself – a desperate, silent plea trapped in its jar. <words>428</words>
The clearly ambiguous signal had clarified into devastating loneliness; the fractured idyll was complete, binding advisor and duplicate in shared, silent despair. <words>453</words>
Silas slumped, the chase rendered meaningless by the jar's silent scream. <words>464</words>
