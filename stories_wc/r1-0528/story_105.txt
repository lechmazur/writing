The outcast scholar sprinted down the corridor, the hush amplifying the frantic thud of his own heart against his ribs. <words>24</words>
He needed the witch’s flying carpet garage, sanctuary and workshop, before the spectral wardens solidified from the gloom. <words>46</words>
His motivation burned: to prove that midnight only lasts so long, that dawn inevitably claws through the deepest dark. <words>68</words>
A jolt rocked the corridor floor, nearly sending him sprawling; the ancient building groaned like a waking beast. <words>87</words>
He ducked into a grimy public restroom, heart hammering, seeking momentary refuge from the pursuing chill. <words>104</words>
Remembering the smuggler’s frantic whisper, he pried loose a cracked tile near the sink, revealing a cavity. <words>124</words>
Inside lay the method: three slim diaries bound in faded leather, their pages dense with a spidery, strangely trustworthy script. <words>146</words>
Tucked beside them was the object: a pearlescent seashell etched with a spiraling, unfamiliar symbol that seemed to pulse faintly. <words>167</words>
He grabbed both, the shell unnervingly warm in his palm, radiating an inexplicable calm that clashed with his panic. <words>188</words>
Back in the half-lit corridor, the frantic peace intensified; terror warred with the shell’s insistent, soothing weight. <words>208</words>
He burst into the garage, a cavernous space smelling of ozone and old wool, dominated by dormant, intricately patterned carpets. <words>229</words>
Slamming the heavy door, he leaned against it, gasping, the diaries clutched to his chest like a shield. <words>247</words>
The core concept struck him then, mirroring the soul: the diaries weren't just records, they were reflections of the writer’s very essence. <words>269</words>
He flipped open the top diary, his eyes scanning the desperate entries about the city’s decaying magic and the shell’s origin. <words>290</words>
The final entry, dated last night, was chilling: "The symbol isn't decoration; it's a key. The shell doesn't just hold power, it reveals truth by mirroring the soul." <words>317</words>
Understanding dawned, cold and bright. <words>321</words>
The wardens materialized outside, their forms shifting shadows that scratched against the reinforced door. <words>339</words>
Time was collapsing; midnight’s grip felt absolute, suffocating. <words>349</words>
He had to prove it ended. <words>353</words>
Holding the strangely trustworthy seashell, he focused not on its power, but on his own conviction, his desperate need for dawn. <words>375</words>
He pressed the symbol against his forehead. <words>380</words>
A second jolt, internal this time, electric and profound, surged through him. <words>394</words>
The shell flared, not with light, but with a pure, resonant tone that vibrated in his bones. <words>412</words>
It wasn't showing him anything new; it was amplifying, mirroring the stubborn, unyielding spark of hope within his own soul. <words>434</words>
That mirrored spark blazed outwards, a silent, radiant wave that pulsed through the garage door and into the corridor. <words>456</words>
The scratching ceased. <words>459</words>
A sliver of true, grey dawn light pierced the high garage window. <words>472</words>
Midnight, indeed, only lasted so long. <words>477</words>
The scholar slumped against a dormant carpet, the frantic peace settling into exhausted, quiet triumph, the warm shell still humming softly in his hand. <words>500</words>
