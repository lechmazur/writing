Ambassador Kael moved with measured steps through the forgotten city hall's echoing rotunda, the rhythmic thrum of drum circles vibrating up through the worn marble floor. <words>21</words> His hand, seemingly of its own accord, brushed the fox tail tassel secured inside his formal jacket pocket, a coarse, unsettling relic seized from the bandit who’d murdered his sister. <words>45</words> The price of revenge was a ledger Kael balanced daily, its figures etched in grief and fury, yet his outward demeanor remained one of abrasive calm, a polished shield against the inner storm. <words>70</words> He was here, amid the primal heartbeat of the drums, not for diplomacy, but to decode genetic patterns hidden within the city's decaying infrastructure, patterns he believed held the key to identifying the bandit's kin. <words>101</words> The tassel itself felt organically synthetic under his touch, real fur unnervingly blended with lab-grown filaments, a disturbing signature of his quarry’s faction. <words>124</words> A junior attache approached, mistaking Kael's intense scrutiny of a water-stained mural for artistic appreciation. <words>142</words> "Quite the vibrant decay, sir?" the attache offered with a nervous smile. <words>152</words> Kael forced a thin-lipped jest, his voice devoid of warmth, "Yes, the city fathers had a flair for the tragically impermanent." <words>170</words> The dismissal was swift, cloaked in dry humor, leaving the attache blinking. <words>183</words> Kael’s focus narrowed, drawn away from the drums and deeper into the building's disused wing. <words>197</words> He pushed open a heavy, dust-laden door, its groan echoing in the silence that abruptly replaced the drums. <words>214</words> Inside lay a shuttered children's theater, frozen in time, thick velvet curtains moth-eaten, tiny chairs overturned. <words>232</words> The air hung heavy, thick with the faint scent of must – decayed wood, damp plaster, and something else, something faintly chemical clinging to the dust motes dancing in his flashlight beam. <words>263</words> It was here, through the faint scent of must in this tomb of forgotten innocence, that Kael found his grim confirmation. <words>285</words> Tucked behind a collapsed scenery flat depicting a cartoon forest, lay discarded vials and a portable sequencer, crude but functional. <words>307</words> Genetic residue coated the equipment, a match to the organically synthetic fibers in the tassel. <words>324</words> His sister’s killer hadn't just taken a life; he’d harvested material here, in this forsaken place, experimenting, weaving his unnatural trophies. <words>351</words> The decoded patterns weren't just identifiers; they were blueprints of violation, turning grief into a map. <words>370</words> Kael pocketed a vial, the drums outside a distant, mocking pulse. <words>383</words> Revenge’s price wasn't just his soul; it was this descent into the killer’s own grotesque logic, hunting monsters by becoming attuned to their creation. <words>409</words> The abrasive calm solidified into ice, a necessary veneer for the bloody work ahead, fueled by the must and the memory and the coarse feel of the fox tail against his ribs. <words>438</words>
