Dr. Aris Thorne, a cryptid researcher working undercover as a janitor, pushed his battered plastic tray along the dusty corridor of the abandoned Veridian Labs, the rhythmic scrape of his broom mingling with the distant sound of leaf raking outside. <words>30</words> He sought evidence of Project Chimera, hoping to expose unethical experiments and, ultimately, to sow seeds of a better tomorrow. <words>50</words> His path led him to a sealed wing, its entrance hidden behind a collapsed shelf, revealing a chilling sight: a labyrinth constructed entirely from broken mirrors. <words>75</words> Stepping inside, Aris was instantly fractured into a thousand distorted reflections, each shard reflecting a different sliver of the decaying lab and his own wary face. <words>100</words> Navigating the disorienting maze required a suspiciously trusting step, believing the path existed even when reflections lied. <words>120</words> Deep within the glass maze, perched precariously on a pile of shattered glass, sat a single, blackened candle stub. <words>140</words> Aris carefully lifted it, placing it on his battered plastic tray like a sacred relic. <words>155</words> He knew he had to excel in his analysis; this candle wasn't just wax, it was a silent witness. <words>175</words> Back in his makeshift basement lab, illuminated by a single bare bulb, Aris employed his unique method: by tracing the burn pattern in the blackened candle wick. <words>200</words> The wick told a story – a long, slow burn, interrupted by frantic, uneven flares, suggesting periods of intense observation followed by agitated waiting. <words>225</words> This wasn't lab work; it felt like a vigil. <words>235</words> His analysis revealed microscopic scales embedded near the base, scales matching no known reptile but aligning with fragmented reports of a captive "Draco-lepid". <words>260</words> The fateful encounter came not with a creature, but with the echo of its keeper, deciphered from the wax and wick. <words>280</words> The researcher pictured a lone scientist, perhaps defying orders, keeping watch over a misunderstood creation by candlelight in that hall of broken reflections. <words>305</words> This discovery, born from tracing soot on cotton, was the key. <words>318</words> It proved Veridian Labs had indeed captured and contained a cryptid, providing the irrefutable evidence Aris needed. <words>340</words> With a grin that held mischievous wisdom, Aris uploaded the data packet – the candle's story, the scale analysis, the mirror maze coordinates. <words>365</words> He wasn't just exposing the past; he was planting undeniable truth. <words>380</words> The whistleblower drop completed, Aris stepped back into the crisp autumn air. <words>395</words> The sound of raking leaves continued, a hopeful rhythm against the backdrop of the decaying lab. <words>415</words> His undercover work was done, the seeds of revelation sown, waiting to bloom into accountability and, perhaps, a chance for the hidden things of this world. <words>445</words> The battered tray felt lighter now, its burden transformed into possibility. <words>460</words>
