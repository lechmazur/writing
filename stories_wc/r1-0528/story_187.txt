The stoic wanderer followed the trail of nightmares, each spectral footprint burning cold against his resolve. <words>15</words> He carried a splintered floorboard from an abandoned cabin, its grain whispering forgotten incantations only he could feel. <words>30</words> His motivation was pure, yet shadowed: to archive ritual practices before they vanished like smoke, preserving truths others deemed too dangerous. <words>48</words> The trail led him, inevitably, to the witch's familiar training ground, a place of mesmerizingly bland appearance – just grey rocks, scrubby grass, and a faint smell of damp earth under a perpetually overcast sky. <words>78</words> Its very ordinariness was the camouflage, the necessary lie that kept the uninitiated away. <words>89</words> Within a crude stone circle etched into the barren ground, a gnarled teacher rasped instructions to a cluster of wide-eyed familiars, their forms flickering between cat, raven, and shadow. <words>114</words> The air crackled with nascent power as the teacher's bony finger traced glowing symbols onto a flat obsidian slab. <words>132</words> Just as the wanderer stepped silently to the circle's edge, the teacher swept a ragged sleeve across the slab – at the moment a teacher wipes the final formula away. <words>159</words> The last intricate sigil dissolved into nothingness, lost. <words>166</words> A ripple of despair went through the familiars; knowledge was being deliberately erased, another necessary lie to protect, or perhaps control. <words>188</words> With brash tenderness, a roughness masking deep care, the wanderer knelt. <words>200</words> He didn't ask; he would impose his will upon this fading magic. <words>211</words> He slammed the cabin floorboard down onto the cold earth within the circle, its weathered surface meeting the latent energy of the training ground. <words>236</words> The wood groaned, then flared with a light that wasn't light, a silent scream of trapped memory. <words>254</words> The erased formula, the very ritual practice the teacher destroyed, blazed back into existence, not on the stone, but seared into the grain of the floorboard itself. <words>283</words> The teacher hissed, a sound like dry leaves, but the wanderer met his gaze, stoic and unmoved. <words>300</words> "The archive needs truth," the wanderer stated, his voice low but cutting through the wind. <words>315</words> "Even hidden truth. Even necessary lies." <words>322</words> The mesmerizingly bland landscape seemed to pulse, absorbing the act, the imposition. <words>336</words> The familiars stared, awestruck, at the floorboard now thrumming with preserved power. <words>352</words> The teacher's defiance crumbled into weary resignation; the wanderer had acted with the brash tenderness of a surgeon saving a life by breaking bone. <words>376</words> The ritual was saved, not on sanctioned stone, but on the humble, rescued wood, a secret archive forged from loss and imposition. <words>400</words> The wanderer retrieved the floorboard, the formula glowing faintly within its fibers, another fragment secured against oblivion's tide. <words>423</words> He turned, leaving the training ground to its deceptive blandness, the trail of nightmares fading behind him as he carried the salvaged truth away. <words>450</words>
