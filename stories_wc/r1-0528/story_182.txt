<story>
The magnetic mountain pulled Leo toward the abandoned Avalon Theatre, its unseen force humming beneath his worn boots. <words>20</words>
Inside, dust motes danced in the beam of the old projector, flickering wildly while casting fractured light onto the peeling silver screen. <words>38</words>
Leo, an unknowing heir to something vast and buried, felt the quiet hunger gnaw—not for food, but for a purpose lost to time. <words>58</words>
He traced the tarnished silver spoon in his pocket, its worn surface cool against his fingers, a trivially monumental relic from a grandmother he barely knew. <words>80</words>
The projector's sputtering light seemed to churn the thick air, stirring memories Leo couldn't quite grasp, filling the derelict hall with a sense of frolicsome regret, like laughter echoing in an empty room. <words>108</words>
Driven by a reckless urge to co-author a future with chaos, Leo scraped at the crumbling plaster wall beside the screen, not knowing why, only feeling the mountain's insistent pull. <words>133</words>
Through the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals, vibrant colours emerged beneath decades of grime: scenes of miners delving deep, strange ore glowing, and a woman holding the very spoon he clutched. <words>162</words>
The quiet hunger roared into focus; this was his legacy, the source of the mountain's magnetism, and the Avalon's forgotten purpose. <words>182</words>
The projector's flicker intensified, its light churning across the revealed mural, making the depicted miners seem to move, their picks striking the luminous rock in time with Leo's hammering heart. <words>207</words>
He understood the trivially monumental weight of the spoon now—it wasn't cutlery, but a key, shaped from the mountain's core, attuning the bearer to its power. <words>232</words>
A frolicsome regret washed over him; all those years adrift, the hunger unanswered, while the truth lay buried under paint and indifference within reach. <words>253</words>
The mountain's resonance deepened, vibrating the theatre's bones; Leo pressed the tarnished spoon against the mural where the ore glowed brightest. <words>274</words>
The hidden scene ignited, the painted ore flaring with real light, and the entire mural began to churn, the images swirling like liquid metal. <words>294</words>
Through the peel of paint layers revealing hidden murals, a doorway materialized within the wall, humming with the same fierce energy as the mountain's heart. <words>316</words>
The old projector finally stuttered and died, plunging the theatre into near-darkness, save for the pulsing glow from the mural-door. <words>336</words>
Leo laughed, a sound tinged with that frolicsome regret; chaos wasn't just coming, he was walking hand-in-hand with it into the mountain's embrace, co-authoring his future with every step toward the light. <words>366</words>
The quiet hunger was gone, replaced by the magnetic thrum of destiny, the tarnished spoon warm and alive in his hand as he crossed the threshold. <words>389</words>
Behind him, the Avalon stood silent, its secret spilled, while the mountain welcomed its unknowing heir home. <words>407</words>
