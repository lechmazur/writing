Brother Silas adjusted the faded carnival prize plush, a grotesque, one-eyed rabbit, strapped incongruously to his belt as he drifted through the Coral Spires. <words>25</words>
His nature walks through the bioluminescent gardens were ostensibly for meditation, but tonight, like most nights, served as reconnaissance. <words>44</words>
The Zealot of the Deep Current sought heretics who dared interpret the Sacred Tides differently, his devotion absolute, his methods… calculatedly playful. <words>70</words>
He spotted his target: Historian Finn, known for his revisionist scrolls, currently admiring a pulsating anemone cluster. <words>90</words>
Silas activated the sonic dampener woven into his robes, initiating the hunt *through reversed echoes*. <words>106</words>
Finn’s gasp echoed backwards, a bizarre hiccup preceding the actual intake of breath, throwing him off balance. <words>125</words>
"Historian Finn," Silas murmured, his voice distorted, seeming to reach Finn’s ears *before* his lips moved, a disorienting effect. <words>147</words>
"Brother Silas! A pleasure, truly," Finn stammered, trying to locate the source of the voice that seemed to come from everywhere and nowhere. <words>169</words>
"Pleasure is fleeting, like the light on these corals," Silas replied, stepping from behind a towering brain coral, his hand resting lightly on the faded plush rabbit. <words>195</words>
"Unlike devotion. Or heresy." <words>199</words>
Finn paled. "My interpretations… they offer perspective! The epic of Saint Maris *needs* the Kraken Lord’s viewpoint to be understood fully!" <words>223</words>
"To *retell an epic from a villain’s view*?" Silas chuckled, a low, rumbling sound that echoed forwards, making Finn flinch prematurely. <words>247</words>
"Is that your great sin, Finn? Seeking the villain’s justification?" <words>259</words>
"It’s about understanding! The *reflection of morality* isn't just light on pristine water; it's the murk, the shadows too!" Finn protested, backing towards a crevice. <words>288</words>
Silas tilted his head, genuinely curious beneath his zeal. "And your scrolls… they *consolidate* this murky view? Unify dissent?" <words>312</words>
"They seek truth!" Finn cried, his voice cracking under the pressure of the reversed echoes warping his perception. <words>333</words>
"Truth is the Current," Silas stated, advancing with predatory grace. "Unchanging. Absolute. Your truth is shifting sand." <words>355</words>
He lunged, not with a blade, but with a swift, practiced motion, using the water resistance to his advantage. <words>377</words>
The struggle was brief, silent but for the distorted gurgles and the frantic scraping against coral. <words>395</words>
As Finn stilled, Silas carefully detached the faded plush rabbit. <words>407</words>
He placed it gently beside the historian, a morbid carnival prize for a performance ended. <words>422</words>
Standing amidst the serene, glowing reef, the absurdity of the plush against the solemnity of death struck him. <words>444</words>
*Humorous solemnity*, he thought, the paradox a cold comfort. <words>452</word>
His walk continued; the Current demanded more consolidation, one silenced voice at a time. <words>468</words>
