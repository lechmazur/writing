<story>
Lord Aris Thorne, forgotten scion of a fallen house, stared at the hummingbird drone hovering near the lab's reinforced viewport. <words>24</words>
Its iridescent wings blurred, a mysteriously obvious surveillance ghost in the sterile air of the spontaneous combustion lab. <words>43</words>
Between the urgent *ping* of a text demanding results and the hollow recklessness vibrating in his own chest, Aris felt the familiar, crushing weight of expectation. <words>70</words>
He needed to fortify his resolve, not just the lab against unpredictable thermal surges, but his spirit against the suffocating illusions of his past grandeur. <words>95</words>
His fingers, trembling slightly, sought the worn leather wallet, not for credits, but for the fragile armour within: a collection of old ticket stubs. <words>118</words>
Methodically, he began their reassembly on the cold steel workbench – a ticket to the Imperial Opera, another for the Sky-Gondola at Zenith Fair, fragments of a life erased. <words>147</words>
Each sliver of paper, meticulously aligned, was an act of defiance, a desperate attempt to fortify his fragmented identity against the erasure time and disgrace had wrought. <words>176</words>
The drone dipped closer, its tiny lens focusing; its presence, meant to intimidate, felt suddenly pathetic against the raw candor in this small moment of personal archaeology. <words>205</words>
*Ping*. Another text: "Progress?" The word pulsed on his wrist-screen, a digital lash. <words>224</words>
He ignored it, focusing on the final stub – admission to the Celestial Gardens on Coronation Day, the last Thorne celebration. <words>247</words>
Placing it completed the mosaic, a tangible echo of what was lost. <words>259</words>
"Observing nostalgia, Lord Thorne?" a smooth voice crackled from the drone's micro-speaker, laced with false concern. <words>280</words>
Aris didn't look up. <words>284</words>
"Candor, Director," he stated, his voice flat, hollow, yet cutting through the lab's sterile silence and the Director's oily pretense. <words>307</words>
"These aren't mementos. They're proof. Proof I was *there*, before the debts, before the fire, before this... gilded cage monitoring why things burn." <words>331</words>
The admission hung in the air, a stark, vulnerable truth offered with reckless abandon. <words>349</words>
The drone whirred, recalibrating, its mysteriously obvious purpose momentarily disrupted by his unexpected frankness. <words>370</words>
*Ping*. "Specimen Seven is primed. Initiate sequence." The command was cold, final. <words>389</words>
Hollow recklessness surged, a familiar, dangerous companion. <words>401</words>
He could obey, trigger another anonymous blaze in the chamber beyond the viewport, another data point for the Director's ambitions. <words>424</words>
Or he could cut through the final illusion – that he was merely a technician, a discarded noble playing with fire. <words>447</word>
His hand hovered over the ignition panel, then swept the reassembled tickets into his palm, their fragile shield now a weapon of truth. <words>473</words>
He turned towards the drone, the hummingbird lens reflecting his own, newly fortified gaze. <words>490</words>
"Tell the Director," Aris said, the candor burning now, not hollow, but fierce, "we need to talk. About *my* fire." <words>510</words>
