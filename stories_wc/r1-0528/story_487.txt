<story>
The docile bruiser, Silas, knelt on creaking floorboards, his massive hands surprisingly delicate as they pieced together a shredded treasure map. <words>23</words>
Amid the relentless thunder of distant drum solos shaking the old conservatory walls, he worked with disturbingly calm focus, each fragment revealing a path through the infamous greenhouse labyrinth. <words>50</words>
His motivation was pure: to mold a myth from the mud of reality, to find the conductor’s baton rumored to raise the dead and bring back his sister, lost to the city's plague. <words>82</words>
The map led him to the overgrown glass structure, a suffocating maze stocked with man-eating plants that snapped at his shadow. <words>103</words>
Vines lashed like whips, pitcher plants gaped hungrily, and thorned creepers reached for his thick arms; Silas moved with brash tenderness, carefully pushing foliage aside rather than tearing through, his docile nature shielding the aggressive flora from his own immense strength. <words>147</words>
Deep within the humid labyrinth, he found the baton resting on a mossy plinth, its wood gleaming faintly. <words>164</words>
As he reached for it, a figure emerged – Kael, the labyrinth’s keeper, speaking in rapid, guttural clicks Silas couldn’t understand, a stark language barrier. <words>189</words>
Kael gestured wildly at the baton, then at the stirring plants, his meaning obscured by the core concept of their mutual incomprehension. <words>210</words>
Silas, maintaining that disturbingly calm demeanor even as a carnivorous bloom lunged near his leg, held up the map, pointing to the baton, then mimed his sister’s violin playing. <words>238</words>
Kael’s eyes widened; he nodded frantically, then pointed urgently back the way Silas came, his clicks now edged with panic. <words>258</words>
The drum solos reached a frenzied crescendo outside, vibrating the glass panes. <words>269</words>
Silas raised the baton, hoping its rumored power transcended words. <words>279</words>
He gave it a hopeful twist. <words>284</words>
Instead of his sister, the plants around him shuddered violently, then stilled, their predatory tension replaced by an eerie, watchful quiet. <words>306</words>
Kael gasped, dropping to his knees before Silas, not in fear, but in awe, speaking reverent clicks – the baton hadn't raised the dead, it had pacified the deadly. <words>336</words>
The twist was profound: Silas, seeking to resurrect one life, had instead tamed an entire lethal ecosystem, molding a new myth of the gentle giant who calmed the man-eating jungle. <words>366</words>
Brash tenderness radiated from Silas as he helped Kael up; their shared silence, bridging the language barrier, spoke louder than any drum solo. <words>391</words>
He hadn't found what he sought, but in the mud of his grief, he'd cultivated an unexpected, living legend. <words>410</words>
