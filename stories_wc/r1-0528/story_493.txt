Sir Alistair adjusted his briefcase, the prudent knight navigating the evening commute's jostling tide. <words>13</words> His fingers brushed the worn leather, finding the loose binder ring securing his most precious cargo: a collection of secondhand letters promising answers. <words>31</words> He smiled, a mysteriously cheerful expression that baffled fellow passengers unaware of the guarded secrets pressing against his ribs. <words>47</words> His quest wasn't gold or glory, but to trace an unknown ancestry, roots lost like whispers in a labyrinth. <words>63</words> The train rattled past concrete canyons, but Alistair saw only the reimagined silhouette of an ancient Minoan palace, its modern office-block descendant glowing amber in the dusk, his destination. <words>85</words> Within the binder, fragile pages whispered of ancestors who walked those very halls millennia ago, coded messages hidden in the looping script. <words>101</words> He needed to understand the cryptic patterns woven into the correspondence, a familial cipher promising revelation. <words>115</words> The loose ring threatened to spill its secrets onto the grimy floor, a constant, anxious counterpoint to his outward calm. <words>130</words> Each lurch of the carriage tightened his grip, his prudence warring with the urge to delve deeper into the fragile papers. <words>146</words> The cheerful mask was necessary armor; who would suspect the mild-mannered commuter of unraveling bloodlines tied to myth? <words>162</words> Stepping onto the platform, the palace-office loomed, its geometric facade echoing bull-leaping frescoes, a familiar unknown pressing upon him. <words>179</words> Inside the echoing, minimalist lobby – a stark reimagining of Knossos – Alistair found a quiet bench beneath a stylized double-axe motif. <words>197</words> Carefully, he slid a brittle letter free, its edges fraying like old memories. <words>208</words> His eyes traced not the words of mundane nineteenth-century gossip, but the subtle, recurring anomalies: ink blots forming constellations, specific letters consistently oversized. <words>228</words> A pattern emerged, aligning with star maps referenced in marginalia about 'Grandfather's observatory'. <words>240</words> The cryptic patterns weren't random; they were coordinates, a celestial map pointing to a family crypt. <words>254</words> Understanding washed over him, cold and bright – his ancestors weren't just courtiers, but astronomer-priests safeguarding sacred knowledge within the original palace walls. <words>274</words> The guarded secrets weren't merely political, but cosmic, etched into the heavens and mirrored in these letters passed hand-to-hand for safety. <words>292</words> The loose binder ring, a mundane annoyance, suddenly felt like the frayed thread of time itself. <words>306</words> His cheerful demeanor flickered, replaced by profound awe tinged with the weight of legacy. <words>319</words> He traced the coordinates with a reverent finger on the thin paper; the crypt lay beneath the building's foundations, untouched. <words>336</words> His unknown ancestry wasn't just traced, it roared into focus – custodians of a lost sky-lore. <words>350</words> The reimagined palace, once just a workplace, now pulsed with the heartbeat of the ancients. <words>365</words> The familiar unknown solidified; this place, this lineage, was his inheritance. <words>377</words> Alistair carefully secured the letter, the loose ring a temporary vulnerability he would mend. <words>391</words> He stood, the prudent knight armed not with a sword, but with celestial coordinates and the resolve to reclaim his birthright from the silent earth below the echoing, modern halls. <words>414</words> The evening commute had ended; a far older journey had just begun. <words>426</words>
