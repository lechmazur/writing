Elara, a heartbreak counselor with a reputation as a femme fatale, studied the sky reflection pool, its surface perfectly mirroring the restless clouds above. <words>20</words>
Her amber earrings, relics from a love that shattered her own heart centuries ago, caught the fractured light, a constant reminder of the gravity of desires. <words>40</words>
Clients came seeking solace after time travel's invention allowed painful revisits to past loves, amplifying their anguish; Elara offered not comfort, but brutal clarity. <words>60</words>
Restlessly curious, she tracked cloud trails across the mirrored sky, interpreting their shifting patterns as emotional signatures, a method honed over lifetimes spent navigating human sorrow. <words>80</words>
Today's client, Marcus, was trapped in a loop, revisiting the moment his wife chose another; his grief was a tangible weight in the charged air. <words>100</words>
"See the cirrus?" Elara pointed, her voice low, a blend of caution and impulsiveness. <words>112</words>
"Like her hair that morning... ephemeral, already dissolving." <words>119</words>
She guided his gaze across the pool's reflection, forcing him to confront the transient beauty he'd mistaken for permanence. <words>134</words>
"The gravity of your desire anchors you to an illusion," she stated, tapping the pool's edge where his wife's reflection dissolved into cloud wisps. <words>152</words>
Marcus flinched, the truth a physical blow. <words>157</words>
Elara understood the pull intimately; her own amber earrings held the echo of a similar, devastating gravity. <words>171</words>
"Time travel shows you the cage," she pressed, her movements sharp, decisive. <words>183</words>
"But only you hold the key." <words>188</words>
With a swift, almost impulsive gesture, she activated the chrono-projector linked to the pool. <words>201</words>
The reflection shifted, showing Marcus not his wife's departure, but himself moments later, clutching a phantom, his face etched with self-deception. <words>222</words>
"Look!" Elara commanded, her own heart pounding with the dangerous thrill of pushing him to the edge. <words>237</words>
"See the cage you built from memory and longing?" <words>244</words>
Marcus stared, a strangled sound escaping him as the image clarified his prison. <words>257</words>
A profound stillness settled over him, replacing the frantic energy of grief. <words>269</words>
He took a deep, shuddering breath, then another, his shoulders straightening. <words>280</words>
Elara watched, a flicker of cautious hope beneath her practiced detachment. <words>291</words>
Marcus turned from the pool, his eyes clear for the first time. <words>301</words>
"I am free," he declared, his voice firm, resonant, proclaiming himself free in the cage of illusions that had held him. <words>319</words>
The simple statement hung in the air, potent and final. <words>327</words>
Elara gave a curt nod, satisfaction warring with the familiar, restless ache in her own chest. <words>340</words>
As Marcus walked away, lighter, she reached up, her fingers brushing the cool amber of her earrings. <words>354</words>
The gravity of her own unresolved desire tugged, a familiar weight. <words>364</words>
With a decisive motion, she moved to zip the protective cover over the now-still reflection pool, sealing away the day's echoes. <words>382</words>
High above, contrails streaked the real sky, but Elara didn't track them; her restlessly curious gaze was inward, contemplating the next client, the next heartbreak, and the heavy amber stones warming her skin. <words>409</words>
The cage was familiar, but within it, she too sought moments of proclamation, fleeting and fierce. <words>423</words>
