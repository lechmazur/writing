<story>
Sheriff Arlo traced the tarnished silver chain around his neck, its cool weight a familiar ghost against his skin during the midday lull when time felt suspended. <words>19</words>
He stood in the hushed scientific poetry library, sunlight slanting through high windows, illuminating dust motes dancing in the silence – the echo of quiet that always settled here between the morning rush and the afternoon scholars. <words>44</words>
The chain, a relic from his wife Elara, felt ethereally physical today, a tangible whisper of absence in the stillness. <words>61</words>
Grief was the town's constant dirge since the mine collapse; a heavy, suffocating song he was expected to conduct. <words>77</words>
But today, staring at the spines of books blending celestial mechanics with verse, Arlo felt a ghostly resolve crystallize within him. <words>94</words>
He wouldn't conduct the dirge anymore. <words>99</words>
He would rebel. <words>101</words>
Not with shouts or force, but by tracing the path of falling stars, just as Elara had taught him on summer nights, mapping hope across the dark. <words>124</words>
He moved to the astronomy section, pulling down volumes on meteor showers and star charts, their pages whispering promises of light streaking through the void. <words>146</words>
His finger traced predicted trajectories on a star map, the lines feeling like lifelines thrown into the cosmos. <words>163</words>
He needed to find that single, defiant point of light, the one that could pierce the gloom. <words>178</words>
To let a single note defeat an entire dirge. <words>186</words>
The library’s quiet deepened, wrapping around him like a shroud, amplifying the chain's faint chime against his badge. <words>204</words>
He remembered Elara’s voice, clear as starlight: "Look up, Arlo, always look up. Even the smallest light travels vast distances to be seen." <words>226</word>
He found it – the Lyrid shower, peaking tonight. <words>234</words>
A fragile, predictable scatter of ancient debris burning bright. <words>243</words>
Hope, fragile as a meteor trail. <words>248</words>
He spent hours planning, the ethereally physical sense of Elara’s presence a steady warmth against the cool chain. <words>267</words>
As dusk approached, Arlo left the library, the ghostly resolve hardening into action. <words>282</words>
He drove to the overlook, the town's lights shimmering below like trapped stars. <words>297</words>
He set up the old telescope Elara had loved, its brass cool under his touch. <words>311</words>
The first star fell, a brief, brilliant scratch on the velvet dark. <words>324</words>
Then another. <words>325</words>
And another. <words>326</words>
Arlo watched, tracing their fiery paths with his eyes, feeling the immense, silent journey each fragment completed just to flare and vanish. <words>348</words>
He raised the battered police radio to his lips, his voice cutting through the usual static of despair. <words>365</words>
"Dispatch, Sheriff Arlo. <words>368</words>
Look up. <words>369</words>
Overlook Hill. <words>371</words>
Look up at the sky right now." <words>376</words>
A pause, then crackling acknowledgements, hesitant at first, then multiplying. <words>390</words>
Below, in doorways and streets, faces tilted upwards, catching the silent, streaking light. <words>407</words>
A collective gasp, soft as the library’s echo of quiet, rippled through the town. <words>423</words>
A single, shared note of wonder against the crushing dirge. <words>434</words>
Arlo touched the tarnished chain, warm now from his skin, and watched the stars fall, a quiet rebellion written in light across the suspended night. <words>459</words>
