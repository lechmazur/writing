The diner's last call echoed through the empty booths as Arlo stepped onto the parallel universe beach, the sand shimmering with impossible hues of violet and gold beneath twin moons. <words>32</words>
His weathered dummy, Barnaby, perched on his shoulder, a silent witness; Arlo, selectively mute since childhood, found his voice only through Barnaby's carved lips. <words>54</words>
Tonight, his mission pulsed with euphoric agitation: to meticulously archive the beach's bizarre weather patterns – rain that fell upwards, clouds shaped like tessellating fish. <words>78</words>
He clutched a damp cardboard coffee sleeve salvaged from the diner, his hopelessly optimistic surface scratched by the day's grind, yet perfect for scribbling cryptic notes about the inverted tides. <words>103</words>
Near a phosphorescent tide pool, Arlo overheard a frantic phone call drifting from behind a dune of singing sand. <words>122</words>
"...no, *listen*," a woman's voice crackled, thick with tears, "He's not 'just a dummy', Ma! Arlo *speaks* through Barnaby... it's real... he's my *brother*, blood or not!" <words>149</words>
Arlo froze, the unexpected defense washing over him, redefining family in a single, overheard sentence. <words>167</words>
He recognized the voice: Lena, the new waitress at the diner, who always tried to patronize him with overly bright smiles and slow, loud questions directed at *him*, not Barnaby. <words>194</words>
Her words, meant for another, resonated deeper than any direct kindness. <words>205</words>
Suddenly, the air crackled; miniature lightning storms fizzed above the waves, a phenomenon Arlo had waited weeks to document. <words>226</words>
Euphoria surged, but agitation gripped him too – how to capture this fleeting spectacle? <words>240</words>
He scrambled, pulling a stubby pencil from his pocket, turning the coffee sleeve inside out, its blank cardboard surface suddenly precious. <words>260</words>
Frantically, he sketched the dancing electrical arcs, Barnaby's head swiveling silently to track the spectacle. <words>277</words>
Another fragmented call sliced through the electric hum: "...because he *sees* things, Ma! Like this beach... he charts impossible weather on napkins, coffee sleeves... it's beautiful!" <words>303</words>
Lena wasn't patronizing him; she was defending his world, his archive, his way of being. <words>321</words>
Arlo’s hopeless optimism, usually a shield against misunderstanding, bloomed into something fiercer. <words>338</words>
As the miniature storm subsided, leaving the air smelling of ozone and burnt sugar, Arlo made a decision. <words>356</words>
He walked towards Lena's voice, Barnaby held ready. <words>365</words>
Reaching her silhouette against the bioluminescent surf, Arlo focused, letting Barnaby's voice, warm and surprisingly steady, break the parallel universe's quiet. <words>389</words>
"Lena?" Barnaby's wooden jaw moved. "Heard... your calls. About... family. About... the weather. Wanna... see the archive?" <words>409</words>
Lena turned, her tear-streaked face illuminated by the twin moons, reflecting Arlo's own euphoric agitation back at him. <words>430</words>
