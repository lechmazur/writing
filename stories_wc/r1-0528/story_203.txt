The orbital debris field shimmered, a silent graveyard of shattered satellites and forgotten missions, where Father Aris floated, his breath fogging the visor. <words>24</words> His hands, usually steady for the Rites, trembled violently; the stage fright, a cruel inheritance of lies whispered by his mentor, choked him now, amid the toy assembly of plastic starships drifting nearby. <words>55</words> The child, oblivious in her pressurized play-bubble, clicked polymer hulls together, her innocent focus a stark counterpoint to the spectral malignancy coiling within the derelict station's core module – a presence that was never usual, a cold intelligence born from cosmic indifference. <words>99</words> Aris clutched the small, frayed book pressed against his chest, its pages brittle and stained, holding the pressed wildflowers his mother had sealed there decades ago on Earth, a fragile anchor to a world he’d failed. <words>132</words> That failure was his true inheritance, the lie that he was worthy, capable, anything but a frightened fraud adrift in the void. <words>156</words> The entity pulsed, its hunger a physical pressure against the bulkhead, whispering promises of oblivion that felt terrifyingly like relief. <words>178</words> He had to act, to sculpt possibility from the ashes of "never" – never good enough, never brave enough, never the exorcist he pretended to be. <words>203</words> The ancient binding ritual demanded immersion, a symbolic drowning in sacred waters that didn't exist out here, only vacuum and frozen metal. <words>226</words> His gaze fell on the child’s play-bubble, its atmosphere thick and humid, a tiny, contained sea. <words>244</words> With a silent prayer that felt like betrayal, Aris triggered the emergency override on the play-bubble’s lock. <words>263</words> The sound of the key turning in the lock – a sharp, decisive *clunk* echoing in the confined module – was the method, the trigger he needed. <words>288</words> It shattered his paralysis. <words>291</words> He lunged, not towards the entity, but towards the child’s sanctuary. <words>306</words> Sealing himself inside the humid, plant-scented air of the bubble, he ignored the child’s startled cry, focusing only on the malignant force surging towards them through the station walls. <words>339</words> He ripped the pressed wildflowers from his book, their faded colors a defiant spark against the grey dread. <words>360</words> Holding them aloft, he began the chant, his voice cracking but unwavering, a defiant hush against the entity’s psychic roar. <words>383</words> The ritual required submergence; here, surrounded by the child’s toys and her wide, trusting eyes, he would submerge not in water, but in the terrifying, necessary act of faith itself. <words>414</words> He pressed the wildflowers against the bubble’s inner wall, facing the encroaching darkness, and poured every ounce of his terrified, inherited, fraudulent being into the words, sculpting a shield of pure, improbable belief from the ashes of "never". <words>456</words> The entity recoiled, repelled not by perfected power, but by the raw, trembling courage of a flawed man finally choosing to stand. <words>482</words>
