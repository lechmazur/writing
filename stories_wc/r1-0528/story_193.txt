<story>
The exiled prince trudged through the blinding whiteness, the sudden snowstorm erasing borders he once knew. <words>18</words>
His motivation was simple yet immense: to find the cure for loneliness that festered like a wound since his banishment. <words>32</words>
Shelter materialized as an abandoned customs office, its windows boarded, its purpose forgotten like his title. <words>46</words>
He forced the heavy door open, the groan of hinges echoing in the cavernous, dust-choked space where stamps and ledgers lay scattered. <words>62</words>
Inside, the air hummed with unseen forces, whispers of long-departed clerks and the weight of transactions lost to time. <words>78</words>
As he secured the door against the howling wind, the turn of the key felt monumental, locking away the past with a decisive click. <words>95</words>
A shuffle in the shadows revealed he wasn’t alone; the storm had driven another soul here—a woman, her eyes wide with the same startled recognition of isolation. <words>115</words>
She gestured to a corner where damp crates spilled their contents: ledgers, seals, and an antique mortar and pestle of tarnished bronze, resting atop a customs form like an unintentionally iconic centerpiece. <words>139</words>
"It belonged to my grandfather," she murmured, her voice blending with the creaking beams. <words>150</words>
"He was the last customs officer here... said it ground truth from lies." <words>161</words>
The prince, trained in botany before his exile, recognized rare dried herbs still clinging inside the mortar—starbloom and frostfern, known for soothing despair. <words>181</words>
Driven by his need to improve not just his own emptiness but perhaps hers, he proposed grinding them into a tea. <words>197</words>
As he worked the pestle in rhythmic circles, a resonant chime filled the room, though neither touched the walls. <words>214</words>
The unseen forces of the office seemed to guide his hands, the powder glowing faintly as snow lashed the roof. <words>231</words>
They shared the bitter brew, warmth spreading through them, not just from the drink but from the simple act of connection forged by the storm. <words>251</words>
He spoke of his exile, the hollow ache of palaces without companionship; she spoke of guarding her grandfather’s legacy in a world that moved on. <words>273</words>
The mortar and pestle sat between them, no longer just a relic but a vessel for their shared purpose. <words>290</words>
Outside, the blizzard raged, sealing them in this liminal space where the familiar unknown—the comfort of a stranger’s understanding—wove its quiet magic. <words>313</words>
By dawn, the storm ebbed, revealing a world transformed by snow. <words>324</words>
As they prepared to leave, the prince placed the mortar and pestle back on the crate, its surface now gleaming with latent possibility. <words>344</words>
"Sometimes," the woman said, pocketing a pinch of the remaining powder, "the cure isn’t a potion, but the hand that offers it." <words>365</words>
He nodded, the loneliness within him softened, not erased, but made bearable. <words>378</words>
They parted at the threshold, the abandoned office behind them holding the echoes of their chance encounter. <words>395</word>
The prince walked toward the sunrise, the key to the customs office cold in his pocket, a reminder that some doors, once locked, free you to begin anew. <words>418</words>
