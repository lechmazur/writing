The fact-minded oracle adjusted her brass compass with desperately casual fingers, its needle spinning wildly in this unstable dimension. <words>19</words>
She sought forgotten places, those realms erased from collective memory, driven by an optimistic desperation that felt like humming static beneath her skin. <words>41</words>
"In the cradle of a whispered minute," she murmured, a factual observation of the dimension's fleeting stability windows, her usual precision a thin veneer over raw need. <words>65</words>
Suddenly, the compass glowed white-hot, searing her palm, and the unstable dimension dissolved into heartbreak-induced visions. <words>79</words>
She saw the vibrant market square of Aethelgard, not as data points, but *felt* the joy of its people – the baker's pride in his crusty loaves, the children's shrieks of pure delight – moments before the cataclysm erased it utterly. <words>112</words>
Their collective, unspoken dread flooded her, a suffocating wave of loss she'd only ever cataloged as "Event Delta-7." <words>129</words>
The vision shifted: a lone scholar, Lyra, desperately etching final observations onto a crumbling wall as the void consumed her observatory, her profound sorrow for unmade discoveries a tangible weight. <words>156</words>
The oracle gasped, the scholar's despair merging with the market's extinguished joy; these weren't historical footnotes, they were visceral wounds. <words>175</words>
Her fact-bound mind recoiled, yet the brass compass vibrated, its needle now pointing *inward*, towards the chasm opening within her own chest. <words>195</words>
This wasn't mere data retrieval; it was the path to empathy, paved with the raw anguish of the forgotten. <words>212</words>
The dimension shuddered violently; the "whispered minute" was ending, threatening to collapse her into the abyss with the places she sought. <words>232</words>
Panic surged, cold and logical – calculate escape vectors! – but the lingering echo of Lyra's sorrow, the phantom scent of the baker's bread, anchored her. <words>254</words>
To survive, to truly *find* these places, she had to recompose not just the fraying dimensional fabric, but herself. <words>273</words>
She couldn't out-logic this heartbreak; she had to *feel* her way through it, embracing the desperate love that fueled Lyra's final etchings, the communal warmth of Aethelgard. <words>298</word>
Closing her eyes against the chaos, she focused on that shared human ache, the profound connection within the loss. <words>315</words>
The brass compass flared, not with logic, but with resonant understanding, its light stabilizing the convulsing space around her. <words>334</words>
She reached out, not with equations, but with the raw, empathetic echo of the forgotten souls, and *pulled*. <words>351</words>
The unstable dimension groaned, then stilled, reality knitting itself anew not through force, but through the quiet power of acknowledged grief. <words>372</words>
Recompose. <words>373</words>
Before her, shimmering into solidity like a tear-streaked mirage, stood the ghostly arches of Aethelgard's market square, infused with Lyra's starlit observations etched onto its stones. <words>398</words>
The forgotten place was found, not just located, but *felt*, its essence preserved within her own, forever altered, heart. <words>418</words>
The oracle touched the cool brass of the compass, its needle now calm, pointing steadily forward on the newly understood path. <words>438</words>
