The aerial gondola swayed gently, suspended over the jagged peaks, carrying Brother Aris through a sky painted with the cautious enchantment of dawn. <words>25</words>
In the heartbeat after the dream returned – the chilling vision of his monastery burning, his mentor’s accusing eyes – Aris clutched the antique flute, its surface scarred with deep, irregular tooth marks. <words>52</words>
The flute itself was visually unappealing, a dark, oiled wood worn smooth in patches yet gouged and splintered near the embouchure, a relic whispering of violence. <words>77</words>
Aris, a monk whose stubbornness was as legendary as his piety, believed these marks held the key to avenging Abbot Linus’s murder; they were not random damage, but a deliberate signature, a taunt. <words>105</words>
He smoothed the creased shipping label stuck to his meditation mat – its faded ink detailing a route from a remote mountain village to the port city – the very path he now traversed, harvesting the past for clues like a grim reaper of truth. <words>137</words>
His motivation was singular, yet terrifyingly intimate: to outsmart his own dark reflection, the vengeful fury he sensed coiled within, the shadow-self the serene monk facade barely contained. <words>164</words>
Through analyzing tooth marks on the antique flute, comparing their unique spacing and depth to known weapons and beasts in the monastery’s bestiary scrolls, Aris sought the killer’s identity. <words>189</words>
The gondola lurched, crossing a particularly deep chasm where the wind howled like the ghost in his dream, making the worn cable groan. <words>210</words>
He traced a deep indentation on the flute’s body; it matched the bite of a ceremonial dagger used only by the monastery’s inner circle, a dagger now missing. <words>234</words>
The creased shipping label pointed towards Silas, a former acolyte expelled for his violent temper, who now operated a smuggling route from that mountain village. <words>258</words>
Silas, who bore a striking, unsettling resemblance to Aris himself – the dark reflection made flesh. <words>274</words>
Harvesting the past meant confronting the bitter truth: Linus hadn't just been murdered; he’d been silenced for uncovering Silas’s treachery, a secret Aris now carried like a burning coal. <words>304</words>
The flute, damaged during the struggle, was Linus’s final message, the tooth marks Silas’s brutal signature, pressed into the wood as he wrenched it from the dying Abbot’s hands. <words>333</words>
Aris felt the old, stubborn rage rise, the vengeful impulse he fought daily, the shadow demanding Silas’s blood in payment. <words>354</words>
But to avenge Linus truly, he couldn't become Silas; he had to outsmart him, using the evidence harvested from this grim artifact and the path on the creased label. <words>380</words>
The gondola began its descent towards the terminal nestled in the target village, the endpoint on the label. <words>399</words>
Aris tucked the visually unappealing flute and the creased shipping label into his robe, his heart a drumbeat of cautious enchantment mixed with grim resolve. <words>422</words>
He stepped out, the mountain air sharp, his path clear: find Silas, present the flute's damning evidence, and let justice, not vengeance, claim his dark reflection. <words>448</words>
The dream’s echo faded, replaced by the chilling clarity of the hunt. <words>460</words>
