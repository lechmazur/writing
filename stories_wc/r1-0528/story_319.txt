On the tidal island where the sea sorted flotsam throughout the ages, a frail guard named Elian patrolled the crumbling watchtower. <words>25</words> His duty, watching for phantom ships, felt like shackles binding him to a predetermined fate he yearned to escape. <words>45</words> Hidden beneath his worn tunic lay a sour-smelling alchemy phial, its viscous contents promising transformation. <words>62</words> Elian's painted allegiances—the official crest on his breastplate masking his true desire for freedom—felt like a constant, itchy lie. <words>81</words> Resolutely wavering between duty and desire, he scanned the horizon, not for enemies, but for the next message. <words>98</words> Communication was perilous, conducted through messages carved in tree bark on the island's solitary oak, revealed only at low tide. <words>118</words> The latest bark fragment, clutched in his trembling hand, held instructions: "Dawn. Cove. Be ready." <words>132</words> Hope, fragile as sea foam, warred with the melancholy of leaving all he knew. <words>146</words> Tonight, under the indifferent gaze of gulls, he would use the phial's contents to alter his appearance, shedding the guard forever. <words>166</words> As the tide began its relentless sorting of the shore, pulling treasures and trash alike back to the deep, Elian felt a similar pull within. <words>188</words> He traced the rough carving on the bark, its promise a lifeline in the salty air. <words>201</words> Suddenly, a heavy footstep crunched on shingle behind him; the garrison captain, eyes narrowed with suspicion, had followed. <words>221</words> "Found something interesting, Elian?" the captain rumbled, hand outstretched for the bark. <words>234</words> Panic, cold and sharp, pierced Elian's frail frame. <words>243</words> Escape, his only dream, hung by a thread. <words>251</words> With a surge of desperate strength fueled by the thought of his predetermined fate—a life of hollow watchfulness—Elian made his choice. <words>270</words> He didn't hesitate; he moved to yank the sour-smelling alchemy phial from its hiding place, its acrid odor blooming in the air as the cork tore free. <words>292</words> The captain lunged, not for the bark, but for Elian's thin wrist. <words>304</words> Elian twisted, the frail guard's surprising agility born of pure necessity. <words>318</words> He flung the phial's contents not onto himself, but straight into the captain's astonished face. <words>333</words> A strangled cry echoed as the viscous liquid met skin, the captain stumbling back, clawing at his eyes. <words>351</words> Elian didn't wait; he turned and ran towards the cove, the hopeful melancholy of departure now a frantic, pounding rhythm in his chest. <words>372</words> The bark message was lost, trampled on the shore, but its purpose was served. <words>387</words> Under the bruised hues of dawn, a small, dark boat waited beyond the breakers, sorting itself from the sea mist. <words>406</words> Elian plunged into the cold water, the island's sorting tide finally releasing him, his painted allegiance dissolving like salt in the waves. <words>428</words> He swam, resolutely wavering no more, towards the unknown, escaping the fate the island had carved for him. <words>447</words>
