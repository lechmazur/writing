<story>
The assassin lurked within the carved obsidian gargoyles adorning the baroque asteroid, a relic orbiting a dying star, its surface a labyrinth of grotesque beauty lit by borrowed starlight. <words>30</words>
His target, the bus driver completing the final route across the unforgiving road – a treacherous, pitted track winding through the asteroid’s sculpted valleys – was minutes away. <words>57</words>
The assassin’s motivation, to cradle the dawn in trembling hands, felt superficially profound, a justification whispered in the void to mask the simple, brutal transaction of life for credits. <words>87</words>
He adjusted the paint-splattered camera lens, salvaged from a long-dead photojournalist, peering through its scratched glass towards the distant terminus where the battered space bus would shudder to its last stop. <words>118</words>
The lens, perpetually smeared with flecks of crimson and ochre, distorted the view, turning the approaching bus’s headlights into smeared, weeping eyes against the asteroid’s ornate spires. <words>147</words>
He tracked the vehicle’s slow progress along the unforgiving road, its suspension groaning over the uneven surface, a metallic beast nearing its final rest. <words>168</words>
The driver, unaware, navigated the last switchback; the assassin’s plan unfolded not through brute force, but via the pattern of a spider's web after rain, intricate and inevitable. <words>193</words>
He’d studied the terminus’s security grid, its laser tripwires invisible to the naked eye, but glistening like dew-laden strands in the specific infrared spectrum his modified lens could perceive. <words>223</words>
The pattern they formed was complex, a lethal latticework, yet the assassin saw the gaps, the safe paths revealed only by the moisture clinging to the energized filaments after the asteroid’s artificial night-rain cycle. <words>256</words>
As the bus hissed to a halt, its doors groaning open onto the deserted, ornate plaza, the assassin moved, a shadow slipping between the glittering, deadly threads revealed via the pattern of a spider's web after rain. <words>289</words>
He was a ghost woven from borrowed starlight, crossing the plaza soundlessly, the paint-splattered camera lens now hanging unused at his side, its purpose served. <words>312</words>
The driver stepped down, stretching weary limbs, his back turned, gazing perhaps at the false dawn creeping over the sculpted horizon – a dawn the assassin was contracted to ensure he never truly saw. <words>342</words>
The assassin closed the distance, the need to cradle the dawn in trembling hands a hollow echo in his mind, drowned by the immediacy of the kill. <words>364</words>
His blade found its mark with silent efficiency, a single, precise motion; the driver slumped without a sound onto the cold, intricately tiled surface of the baroque asteroid. <words>389</words>
Standing over the cooling form, the assassin looked at his own hands, clean but soon to tremble not with anticipation, but with the cold vacuum of the deed. <words>414</words>
He looked towards the lightening sky, the false dawn promising nothing, and let out a short, sharp laugh – a sound devoid of humor, cracking the borrowed starlight silence. <words>440</words>
It was done; the unforgiving road had claimed its last passenger, delivered by his hand. <words>454</words>
