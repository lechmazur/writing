The homemade raft scraped riverbank stones as Baron pushed it into open water, his calloused hands trembling with luminous doubt. <words>24</words>
He'd spent years archiving seasonal changes in glass jars, but this empty bottle felt different—final. <words>42</words>
His catacomb orchard loomed behind him, ancient tree roots snaking between crumbling bones he'd unearthed while digging a new root cellar. <words>61</words>
Those skeletal remains, visibly obscure beneath centuries of silt, had whispered secrets he couldn't decipher. <words>76</words>
Now, drifting toward the river's center, Baron saw her—a spectral figure wreathed in mist where the orchard met the shore. <words>95</words>
She raised translucent hands, communicating through the silent fluency of sign language: "The roots remember what the bones forget." <words>115</words>
Baron froze, the raft bobbing; he'd only learned signing after the Great Silence, when voices vanished. <words>132</words>
Her gestures grew urgent, reflecting the unknown—the true purpose of his archive. <words>145</words>
"Not seasons," she signed, her form flickering like candlelight, "but cycles. Life. Death. Regrowth." <words>161</words>
The bottle in his grip felt suddenly heavy, a vessel not for cider or preserves, but for messages cast into time's current. <words>182</words>
He recalled unearthing a child's skull cradled by apple roots, pearlescent in the lantern glow—a moment steeped in luminous doubt. <words>201</words>
The ghostly woman pointed to the bottle, then to the catacomb's darkest archway, where skeletal fingers seemed to brush low-hanging pears. <words>224</words>
"Speak for those buried," her hands pleaded silently. "Carry their seasons forward." <words>238</words>
Baron understood: his isolation wasn't retreat, but guardianship. <words>247</words>
He pulled a pear from his pocket, one grown directly above a cluster of phalanges, and placed it inside the empty bottle. <words>268</words>
Corking it tight, he held it aloft—a tangible archive of intertwined life and decay. <words>283</words>
The woman nodded, her smile like moonlight on water, visibly obscure yet profoundly clear. <words>298</words>
As the raft touched the river's stronger current, Baron cast the bottle into the flow, watching it bob toward the horizon. <words>318</words>
Her signing resumed, reflecting the unknown journey ahead: "The roots drink from deep places. So must you." <words>337</words>
He signed back, fingers moving with newfound certainty against the fading light: "I will listen." <words>353</words>
The ghost dissolved into the orchard mist as the raft drifted beyond familiar bends. <words>368</words>
Baron watched the bottle glide ahead, a tiny beacon carrying the memory of bones nourishing fruit, of seasons measured in growth rings and silent stories. <words>394</word>
The river widened, swallowing the distant speck, and in that luminous doubt, he felt the weight of the underground orchard—roots knitting earth to sky, death to life—anchoring him to the unseen currents he now vowed to navigate. <words>429</words>
