<story>
Sir Gareth, a weatherbeaten knight whose armor bore the dents of countless storms, stood before the towering lighthouse prison, its beam slicing through the fog like a cold, accusing finger. <words>35</words>
The only entrance was sealed by a massive, salt-corroded door, its center dominated by a heavy brass door knocker shaped like a weeping angel. <words>53</words>
He raised a gauntleted hand, hesitating; entering meant confronting the impossible choices that had led him here, choices that echoed in the crashing waves against the jagged reef below. <words>81</words>
Inside, the air tasted of salt and despair, the circular chamber littered with seemingly random items: a chipped porcelain doll's head, a rusted key, a dried sprig of lavender, a smooth black stone, and a tarnished silver locket. <words>118</words>
Gareth knelt, his movements stiff with age and sorrow, and began to arrange the objects, driven by a desperate need to understand, to find meaning in the wreckage of his past. <words>149</words>
As he placed the locket beside the stone, aligning the key with the doll's vacant stare, a grudgingly sweet memory surfaced – not of grand battles, but of his daughter's laughter, a sound he'd sacrificed for duty. <words>185</words>
He paused, truly appreciating the fragile beauty of that memory, a warmth blooming in his chest even as the prison's chill seeped into his bones. <words>209</words>
The pattern emerged: the objects formed the constellation Lyra, his daughter's namesake, etched onto the cold stone floor – a message from her, left before the plague took her, a plea for remembrance he'd failed to heed. <words>247</words>
His motivation crystallized, sharp and agonizing: he must hush the final cry of regret that had haunted him for a decade, the cry he heard in every gale, the cry he *was*. <words>276</words>
He climbed the spiral stairs to the lantern room, the great lens fractured but still catching the dying sun. <words>294</words>
Within the mirrored reflection of the fractured lens, he saw not his own weary face, but a swirling vortex of moments: his daughter reaching for him as he rode away to war, the plague-stricken village he arrived too late to save, the lighthouse warden he'd condemned to this prison for failing *him*. <words>342</words>
The impossible choice lay bare within that reflection: remain trapped by his grief forever, or shatter the lens, extinguishing the guiding light but silencing the phantom cries, including his own enduring scream of loss. <words>377</words>
With a roar that was part anguish, part release, Sir Gareth drove his fist into the central prism. <words>394</words>
Glass exploded outwards in a shower of light, the beam dying instantly, plunging the reef into darkness but also into a profound, echoing silence. <words>418</words>
He stood amidst the glittering wreckage, a smile touching his cracked lips – a joyful agony, the sweet memory finally louder than the cry of regret, purchased with the light he extinguished. <words>448</words>
