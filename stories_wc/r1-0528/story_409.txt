The attic dust tasted like defeat, coating Kael's split lip as he shifted on the splintered crate, his bruised ribs protesting. <words>25</words>
Around him, forgotten clockwork animals stood frozen mid-motion: a fox poised to pounce, a bird with wings eternally spread, all silent sentinels in the gloom. <words>47</words>
He clutched the jagged clay pot shard, its sharp edges biting into his calloused palm, the faded inscription – *Stand True* – a mocking relic of the principles he once thought unbreakable. <words>78</words>
He was, he knew, skillfully incompetent; a fighter whose precise footwork and honed reflexes masked a fatal flaw – an inability to land the decisive blow when it truly mattered, always hesitating at the critical moment. <words>108</words>
His motivation now was stark, born of the crushing humiliation in the ring last night: to extinguish the last vestige of self-deception that whispered he was anything but a coward when the stakes were highest. <words>139</words>
He traced the inscription, the attic's silence pressing close, the dust motes dancing in the single shaft of light like forgotten dreams given fleeting form. <words>161</words>
*Through forgotten dreams*. <words>164</words>
The phrase surfaced, unbidden, from the depths of his exhaustion, a half-remembered warning from his old mentor about the sculptor who lived below, a man obsessed with capturing fleeting moments in stone. <words>193</words>
At that precise instant, a sharp, clear *crack* echoed up through the floorboards – the unmistakable sound of a sculptor’s chisel first striking virgin marble. <words>219</words>
The sound acted like a key turning in a hidden lock. <words>228</words>
The dusty air shimmered, not with heat, but with the sudden, overwhelming rush of Kael’s own buried memories, his forgotten dreams: the childhood yearning for heroism, the adolescent vow to stand for something pure, the later compromises that eroded it all. <words>269</words>
They weren't just recalled; they *surged*, tangible and suffocating, wrapping around him like spectral chains. <words>284</words>
He tried to rise, to fight the intangible pull, but the weight of his own discarded ideals, his self-deceptions laid bare, was too much. <words>305</words>
The attic, the clockwork animals, the dust – they dissolved, not into darkness, but into the blinding whiteness of uncarved marble. <words>326</words>
He was being *abducted*, not by hands, but by the sheer, crushing force of his own neglected past and failed promises, pulled through the conduit of those forgotten dreams triggered by the chisel's strike. <words>358</words>
He felt himself compacted, pressed, his essence flowing into the cold stone beneath the sculptor’s hands. <words>377</words>
There was no pain, only a terrifying stillness, the finality of capture. <words>389</words>
He was becoming part of the block, his formless self merging with the potential shape. <words>405</words>
In that suspended moment, trapped between being and unbeing, Kael understood. <words>418</words>
To truly stand for something meant confronting the cowardice, the skill that masked incompetence of spirit, the self-deceptions that allowed him to fail. <words>441</words>
His final, desperate thought before the marble claimed him completely was not of escape, but of the inscription on the shard left behind in the dusty attic: *Stand True*. <words>468</words>
Perhaps the sculpture would. <words>471</words>
