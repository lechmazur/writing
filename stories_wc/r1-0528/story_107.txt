Barry "Buzz" Malone, former host of "Chance of a Lifetime," cursed the coconut husk he was gnawing, the bitter honey taste of his faded fame clinging like island humidity. <words>25</words>
He'd been stranded here since the plane crash, his game show smile now a sun-bleached grimace, surrounded only by the relentless insect symphony hall of the jungle night. <words>50</words>
His sole salvage was a heavy, cloudy crystal ball, salvaged from the wreckage, which he'd strangely always found vaguely comforting, a useless relic in this useless place. <words>75</words>
When the old, salt-corroded typewriter he'd painstakingly salvaged and used to document his despair finally fell silent, its keys irrevocably jammed, a profound emptiness swallowed him whole. <words>100</words>
That night, a sudden, violent fever gripped him, shaking his bones to the rhythm of the cicadas' drone, leaving him delirious and helpless on the sand. <words>125</words>
He awoke to cool water on his lips and the concerned face of Kael, a young islander whose silent observation of the "crazy sky-man" had shifted to pity. <words>150</words>
Kael spoke of his people, guardians of sacred knowledge etched onto fragile bark scrolls, knowledge now threatened by a developer's bulldozers poised to raze their hidden valley. <words>175</words>
Buzz's motivation, previously focused solely on his own rescue, twisted painfully; he needed to help Kael rescue that irreplaceable wisdom. <words>200</words>
He remembered the crystal ball, its surface swirling strangely always when he touched it, sometimes showing fleeting, confusing images. <words>225</words>
Desperate for a solution, Buzz clutched the ball, pleading for guidance under the moonlit insect symphony hall. <words>245</words>
An image flared: the developer's fuel depot, vulnerable and unguarded. <words>260</words>
A reckless plan formed, fueled by desperation and lingering showmanship: sabotage. <words>275</words>
He'd create a diversion, drawing the developer's crew away while Kael secured the scrolls. <words>290</words>
But handling the heavy ball clumsily in his weakened state, Buzz accidentally knocked it against a rock. <words>310</words>
A hairline crack snaked across its surface, and the internal swirls froze, the strange visions gone. <words>330</words>
He'd sabotaged his own strange tool in his haste to help. <words>345</words>
Yet, looking at Kael's determined face, Buzz felt a gentle overturn within, a shift from bitter self-pity to the sharp, clear purpose of protecting something greater than himself. <words>370</words>
The cracked ball, useless for visions, became a potent symbol. <words>385</words>
"Right," Buzz rasped, the old host persona flickering back, not for fame, but for a final, meaningful act. <words>405</words>
"Let's give them a show they won't forget." <words>415</words>
The insect symphony hall seemed to swell in anticipation as they moved into the shadows. <words>435</words>
