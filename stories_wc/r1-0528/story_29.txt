Sir Gareth pressed deeper into the mystic orchard garden concealed within a hedge maze, its air thick with the scent of overripe plums and forgotten promises. <words>25</words> His quest, fueled by the desperate need to sabotage the machine that cycles regrets, felt both noble and terrifyingly fragile. <words>42</words> The sudden hush of a streetlamp flickering out plunged the hidden grove into profound, expectant silence. <words>56</words> He was a hopeful knight, yes, but one whose optimism was cleverly naive, trusting ancient texts over the palpable dread coiling around the gnarled apple trees. <words>78</words> His boot scuffed something hard; kneeling, he found a stray jigsaw edge, obsidian and impossibly cold, humming faintly against his gauntlet. <words>99</words> It felt like a key, resonating with the very air of this place saturated with sorrow. <words>113</words> Ahead, nestled amongst roots like grasping fingers, pulsed the Regret Engine: a monstrous loom of brass and shadow, weaving threads of remorse into shimmering, agonizing tapestries depicting every soul's deepest "if only." <words>143</words> This was the source, the architect of the pervasive melancholy choking the kingdom. <words>156</words> To reclaim the lost joy, the stolen moments of peace stolen by endless rumination, he had to stop it. <words>173</words> His naive hope whispered: the obsidian shard was the answer. <words>184</words> Holding the stray jigsaw edge aloft, Gareth focused his will, not on force, but on listening. <words>200</words> He sought not to shatter, but to sync with the machine's own cryptic frequencies, the mournful thrumming that vibrated through the earth and air. <words>223</words> It was a desperate gamble, trusting resonance over rage. <words>233</words> He closed his eyes, letting the shard's vibration merge with the Engine's dirge, his hopeful spirit acting as a conduit. <words>252</words> A piercing tone, neither sound nor silence, erupted as the frequencies locked. <words>264</words> The machine shuddered violently, its gears grinding against the unnatural harmony. <words>277</words> Gareth screamed, not in pain, but in overwhelming sensation â€“ the bliss of potential hope reclaimed warring with the agony of absorbing a thousand condensed regrets flooding his mind. <words>306</words> It was agonizing bliss, a searing baptism in collective sorrow and fleeting liberation. <words>322</words> He held fast, the cleverly naive knight becoming the fulcrum. <words>334</words> With a final, dissonant shriek, the Regret Engine fractured along invisible seams. <words>347</words> The obsidian shard dissolved into motes of light. <words>356</words> Silence returned, deeper now, cleansed. <words>363</words> The woven tapestries unraveled into harmless mist, releasing their captured ghosts of remorse. <words>379</words> Exhausted, Gareth collapsed, the orchard sighing around him, the lost moments finally, blessedly quiet. <words>398</words> He had neutralized the cycle. <words>403</words> Reclaiming the lost had cost a piece of his innocence, but filled the void with fragile, hard-won peace. <words>422</words>
