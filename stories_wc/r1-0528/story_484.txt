<story>
The groggy brewer stumbled through the haunted mansion graveyard, the lingering scent of hops clinging to him like a shroud, his head pounding from last night's overindulgence. <words>25</words>
He was there, ostensibly, to tend the neglected plots, a duty he performed with flippant solemnity, cracking dark jokes to the headstones about the pointlessness of it all. <words>50</words>
Beyond the rusted iron fence, a protest raged against the new city development encroaching on the historic district, its chants a distant, angry hum. <words>75</words>
During the lull in the protest when voices gather again for a final surge, a deeper, colder silence descended upon the graveyard, making the brewer shiver despite the ale still warming his veins. <words>100</words>
He felt the encroaching darkness not just as nightfall, but as a palpable, chilling presence seeping from the mansion's cracked foundations and the ancient, leaning stones. <words>125</words>
His motivation, buried deep beneath layers of cynicism and cheap beer, was surprisingly pure: to become a living embodiment of one's values, specifically the forgotten duty to honor the dead, even if he mocked it aloud. <words>150</words>
Seeking refuge or perhaps just a shortcut, he pushed open the creaking door of the dilapidated mansion, its interior thick with dust and the smell of decay. <words>175</words>
His boot scuffed something on the threshold â€“ a small, sharp piece of a broken mirror, its edge catching the weak light filtering through grimy windows. <words>200</words>
He pocketed it absently, a uniquely generic token of the place's decay, thinking it might bring seven years of bad luck, or maybe just cut his finger later. <words>225</words>
The main hall yawned before him, dominated by a grand, dusty spiral staircase winding upwards into shadow. <words>245</words>
He needed to initiate something, anything, to push back the suffocating gloom, to prove his flickering resolve wasn't just ale-induced bravado. <words>270</words>
His eyes scanned the staircase, searching for a sign, a trigger, a way to begin the confrontation he felt brewing in the oppressive air. <words>295</words>
Then he saw it: via the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase step, a faint, rusty stain shaped almost like a pointing finger, leading upwards. <words>320</words>
It felt like an invitation, or a dare. <words>325</words>
Touching the cold, stained wood, a jolt ran through him, and the pocketed mirror shard grew icy against his thigh. <words>345</words>
As he placed his foot on the marked step, the shadows in the hall seemed to writhe and deepen, the encroaching darkness responding to his action. <words>370</words>
The distant protest chants swelled again outside, a counterpoint to the spectral silence within, as the groggy brewer ascended into the gloom, the broken mirror fragment his only, flimsy shield against the gathering dark. <words>400</words>
He gripped the shard, its edge biting into his palm, a sharp, real pain anchoring him against the unreal dread coiling up the stairs. <words>425</words>
The flippant solemnity hardened into grim resolve; he would face this darkness, embody the keeper's duty, or be consumed by it. <words>450</words>
The staircase groaned beneath him, leading deeper into the haunted heart. <words>460</words>
