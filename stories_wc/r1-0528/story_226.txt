<story>
The gloomy orchardist tended his whispering trees, their metallic leaves chiming softly in the desert wind. <words>15</words>
His orchard wasn't of fruit, but of sound, cultivated with a craftsman's pride in the barren wastes. <words>30</words>
He sought the rarest seeds: lost lullabies, fragments of melody imbued with forgotten comfort and power. <words>45</words>
His latest acquisition, secured via black-market transactions in the shadowed canyons, was a sun-bleached desert skull. <words>60</words>
It felt ancient, yet its porous bone hummed with a resonance that was genuinely artificial, a crafted vessel. <words>75</words>
This skull, he believed, could contain the volatile essence of the lullabies he hunted, preventing their fragile magic from dissipating. <words>90</words>
The time was now, during the hush where past meets prophecy, when the veil between memory and future thinned. <words>105</words>
He journeyed to the derelict resonance testing facility, its skeletal towers clawing at the twilight sky. <words>120</words>
Within its echoing main chamber, under flickering emergency lights, he placed the skull upon the central plinth. <words>135</words>
Haggard awe filled him as he activated the facility's last functioning resonator, its low thrum vibrating the dust. <words>150</words>
He poured the first captured lullaby – a stolen fragment of a Martian cradle song – into the skull's hollow. <words>165</words>
The bone glowed faintly, pulsing in time with the melody, containing its wild energy perfectly. <words>180</words>
Success ignited his gloomy heart; his craftsman's pride swelled at the perfection of the vessel he'd procured. <words>195</words>
He repeated the process, feeding the skull lullaby after lullaby: a Venusian rain chant, a Jovian ice whisper. <words>210</words>
Each song was absorbed, contained within the genuinely artificial matrix of the ancient, manufactured bone. <words>225</words>
The air crackled with contained power, a library of stolen sleep woven into the skull's structure. <words>240</words>
The hush deepened, the facility groaning as if straining under the weight of accumulated prophecy. <words>255</words>
He prepared the final, most potent lullaby – a Mercurian sun-hymn, bought dearly via black-market transactions with asteroid miners. <words>270</words>
As he channeled its searing melody into the skull, the resonator overloaded, whining into a shriek. <words>285</words>
The skull blazed with contained light, vibrating violently on the plinth, threatening to shatter. <words>300</words>
Haggard awe turned to desperate focus; his gloomy features were etched with the strain of control. <words>315</words>
His craftsman's pride demanded he master this, contain this last song, complete his collection. <words>330</words>
He threw switches, rerouting power, his hands moving with the precision born of years tending his sonic orchard. <words>345</words>
The resonator stabilized; the skull's light dimmed to a steady, warm pulse, humming with the contained power of all the lost lullabies. <words>360</words>
Silence, thick and profound, fell within the resonance testing facility. <words>375</words>
The hush where past met prophecy held its breath. <words>385</words>
The orchardist slumped, exhausted, gazing at the skull, his gloomy expression softened by profound, weary satisfaction. <words>400</words>
He had done it; he had collected them all, contained them safely, a testament to his relentless pursuit and skill. <words>415</words>
The vessel held the future's lullaby, and the past's requiem, ready for whatever came next. <words>430</words>
He picked up the warm skull, its artificial bone now thrumming with ancient, stolen sleep, and walked out into the desert dawn. <words>450</words>
