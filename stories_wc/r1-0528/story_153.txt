<story>
The eternal college student, perpetually enrolled in Immortality Studies, received the coal miner’s headlamp as a gifted burden from a spectral alumnus who perished in the Cumberland Collapse. <words>24</words>
Its cracked lens and faint carbide smell were a tangible weight, a relic demanding investigation in a universe where the last star had flickered out millennia ago, leaving only the subterranean bioluminescence of the mole people's city. <words>51</words>
His motivation, sharpened by eons of lecture halls, was singular: to become a master of his own reality, escaping the passive eternity of academia. <words>70</words>
The method presented itself via swapped travel journals; his own detailed the sunlit world lost to time, while the one he received, bound in fungal leather, mapped the endless, twisting warrens beneath. <words>97</words>
Following the glowing spore-ink directions, he descended past forgotten geothermal vents into the vast, echoing caverns where the mole people cultivated luminous fungi on ribbed vaults. <words>122</words>
The headlamp, useless against the city's pervasive fungal glow, became mundanely glorious strapped to his pack, a stark, human artifact amidst the soft-lit alien architecture. <words>150</words>
He traded knowledge snippets with a mole historian, their communication a detached devotion to preservation, exchanging theories on cellular senescence for songs hummed through seismic stone. <words>178</words>
The historian gifted him another burden: access to the Whispering Stacks, archives carved into living crystal that pulsed with the recorded memories of generations. <words>204</words>
Here, amidst the silent thrum of compressed time, the student saw his chance. <words>214</words>
He resolved to digitize the entire corpus of mole wisdom, their unique understanding of reality forged in perpetual darkness. <words>234</words>
Using salvaged components from ancient human outposts and mole bio-circuits, he built a scanner that translated the crystal's light-patterns into shimmering data streams. <words>259</words>
The process was meticulous, a detached devotion to capturing the essence of a civilization thriving after stars. <words>278</words>
As he worked, the headlamp’s mundane bulk, a relic of a dead surface world, glinted with a quiet, glorious defiance against the cavern’s eternal gloom. <words>305</words>
Digitizing the archives wasn't theft, but translation; a gift burdening him with the responsibility to carry their reality forward. <words>326</words>
The final crystal hummed its last frequency into his machine just as the deepest geothermal veins began to cool. <words>346</words>
Holding the data core, a dense sphere of captured light and thought, the student felt the shift. <words>364</words>
He wasn't just studying immortality anymore; he held the compiled reality of a world that outlasted stars. <words>384</words>
The gifted burdens – the headlamp, the journals, the archives – coalesced. <words>397</words>
Mastery wasn't dominance, but synthesis; his own reality now encompassed the mole city's deep-time resilience, the miner's lost struggle, and his own eternal study, viewed with detached devotion. <words>429</words>
He ascended, the mundanely glorious headlamp his only light, carrying a digitized universe in his palm. <words>447</words>
