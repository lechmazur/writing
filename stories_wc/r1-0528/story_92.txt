Twilight bled indigo across the Ravenswood Manor gardens as I approached, leashes coiled like sleeping snakes in my hand; the ultra-rich preferred their walks at this liminal hour, when color bleeds from day into night, leaving the world hushed and watchful.<words>40</words>
Inside the cavernous foyer, the familiar chill settled, deeper than stone, a loud silence pressing against my eardrums.<words>56</words>
My employers, the Van der Luydens, were absent, as usual, leaving only their trio of anxious Borzois and the oppressive grandeur.<words>78</words>
Tonight, the dogs strained not towards the gardens, but deeper into the house, towards the rarely used formal dining room.<words>98</words>
Pushing open the heavy oak door, the scent hit me first: damp earth and something cloyingly sweet, emanating from the centerpiece – Mrs. Van der Luyden’s infamous botanical collection, a glass-domed menagerie of carnivorous plants and rare, venomous orchids.<words>138</words>
The dogs whined, pressing against my legs, their fear a tangible thing in the frigid air.<words>154</words>
I understood; the room felt occupied, watched.<words>162</words>
Memories surfaced, sharp and sudden: the blood drive last month, held in the manor’s ballroom.<words>178</words>
Amidst the sterile scent of antiseptic and the low murmur of donors, I’d encountered Mr. Van der Luyden.<words>196</words>
He’d been pale, drawn, his usual patrician calm frayed.<words>206</words>
Over lukewarm juice, he’d spoken obliquely, desperately, about "unseen burdens" and "legacies that linger."<words>223</words>
He’d mentioned the dining room, the plants, the twilight hour.<words>234</words>
"Things gather there," he’d murmured, eyes avoiding mine, "when the light fails."<words>248</words>
It wasn’t a request, but a silent agreement formed in that sterile space: I would walk the dogs into that room at dusk, a carefully careless intrusion into their haunted sanctum.<words>281</words>
He needed someone to witness, to stand where fear dares not tread, a buffer against whatever lingered.<words>300</words>
I moved with deliberate nonchalance, a carefully careless saunter towards the grotesque botanical collection, the dogs trembling at my heels.<words>323</words>
The air thickened, the temperature plummeting further.<words>332</words>
Shadows coalesced near the head of the immense mahogany table, swirling like ink dropped in water.<words>349</words>
A pressure built in my chest, a silent scream echoing the loud silence of the room.<words>366</words>
The dogs froze, a low growl rumbling in the smallest one’s throat.<words>379</words>
The shadow pulsed, cold radiating from it.<words>388</words>
This was why I came, why I accepted the exorbitant fee and the unspoken dread.<words>404</words>
Not just for the money, but to justify my own presence in these gilded cages, to prove I wasn’t just a servant of the rich, but a quiet challenger in their haunted world.<words>437</words>
I took another step towards the writhing darkness, the botanical collection glistening under the dying light, a silent testament to the unnatural.<words>460</words>
"Evening," I said, my voice steady, cutting through the oppressive quiet, a declaration into the void.<words>479</words>
The dogs pressed closer; the shadow seemed to hesitate.<words>489</words>
We stood our ground, in the haunted dining room, as night finally consumed the bleeding day.<words>505</words>
