The vigilant orchardist, Arlo, arrived precisely at eight, never tardy, his boots crunching gravel at the paper airplane test facility's entrance. Throughout volunteering here, a distraction from the crushing grief of his wife's sudden death, Arlo sought solace in meticulous observation, a habit honed among his apple trees. Today, however, the facility's usual sterile hum felt charged; engineers scurried with unusual tension, whispering about anomalous flight paths sabotaging critical data collection. Arlo's sharp eyes, trained to spot blight on a distant branch, noticed the discarded prototype near Hangar Three – its wing bore a faint, deliberate crease pattern, utterly unlike random damage. It resembled, with sardonic glee twisting Arlo's lips, the intricate, shimmering eye-spots of a peacock's tail. This wasn't accident; it was a signature. His personal tragedy, the void he fought daily to overcome, sharpened his resolve into a cold, focused blade; someone was playing games with fragile things, and he despised fragility now. He pocketed the damaged wing, its pattern a silent accusation. Back in the cluttered volunteer break room, amidst blueprints and coffee stains, Arlo spread the wing on a table. He needed to demonstrate the sabotage's method, to prove it wasn't random chaos but deliberate, patterned malice. Pulling a worn velvet pouch from his pocket, his sole inheritance and a fragile link to his wife, Arlo withdrew the antique letter seal – its base a complex, swirling design. Holding it beside the creased wing pattern, the connection was undeniable: the vandal was replicating the seal's unique design onto the planes, via the patterns in a peacock's tail, a flamboyant, mocking flourish embedded in the sabotage. The seal wasn't just a relic; it was the key, its design known only to a select few collectors. Unraveling conspiracies required patience, like waiting for fruit to ripen. Arlo meticulously compared the seal's impression on wax to the wing creases, documenting the match. He observed test flights with renewed intensity, spotting the tell-tale pattern subtly altering trajectories on specific prototypes. The saboteur, likely an insider exploiting volunteer access, was targeting designs funded by a rival corporation. With sardonic glee, Arlo assembled his evidence: photographs, flight logs, the damaged wing, and the undeniable match made with the antique seal. He presented it all, coolly and precisely, to the stunned facility director. "Observe," Arlo stated, his voice devoid of its usual warmth, pressing the seal into soft wax and laying it beside the wing. "The method is clear. The signature is theirs." The intricate swirls, lifted from a peacock's tail and etched onto history through the seal, now etched the saboteur's fate. Justice, Arlo thought with bleak satisfaction, felt like a particularly tart apple.
