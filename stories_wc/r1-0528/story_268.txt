The abandoned train station waiting area echoed with screaming silence, broken only by the faint hum of a flickering fluorescent light. <words>18</words>
Inside this derelict space, the subdued vigilante knelt on cracked linoleum, his focus entirely on mastering an ancient art passed down through generations of warriors. <words>36</words>
A plain wooden bead, worn smooth by decades of handling, rested between his thumb and forefinger as he practiced intricate pressure-point techniques meant to disarm without permanent harm. <words>55</words>
His movements were artfully clumsy—a deliberate facade of inelegance masking lethal precision, developed to avoid drawing attention during covert missions. <words>75</words>
Nearby, an antique funhouse mirror leaned against a boarded-up ticket window, its warped surface reflecting fragmented images of peeling walls and scattered debris. <words>95</words>
He tracked distortions in the mirror’s reflection, studying how light bent around concealed exits and hidden traps within the station, a method perfected during long surveillance stints. <words>117</words>
A tablet propped on a rusted chair pinged, launching him into scheduled virtual calls that maintained his civilian cover as a cultural artifacts appraiser. <words>137</words>
During one call, a client bragged about acquiring plundered wartime relics; the vigilante forced himself to flatter the man’s "discernment," bile rising as he pictured villages razed for such trophies. <words>163</words>
Each compliment tasted like ash, a reminder of the price of war—how conflict commodified heritage and left hollowed souls in its wake. <words>182</words>
He rotated the wooden bead in his pocket, its unassuming presence grounding him when memories of smoke-choked battlefields threatened to surface. <words>201</words>
Outside, wind howled through broken windows, but inside, the screaming silence intensified, thick with unsaid truths and the weight of his double life. <words>224</words>
Focus returned as he noted a new distortion in the funhouse mirror—a shadow where none should exist—signaling an intruder’s approach through the station’s eastern tunnel. <words>248</words>
He ended the virtual call abruptly, citing poor connection, then melted into the gloom with artfully clumsy steps, appearing to stumble against a pillar while positioning himself for an ambush. <words>276</words>
The bead pressed into his palm, a tactile mantra: protect, don’t punish; this art demanded mercy where vengeance once ruled. <words>297</words>
Two looters emerged, arguing over a stolen ceremonial dagger, oblivious to his presence until he "accidentally" knocked over a pile of cans. <words>319</words>
They spun, knives drawn, but the vigilante was already moving, disarming the first with a wrist lock that mimicked a fumble, then sweeping the second’s legs in a motion disguised as a fall. <words>346</words>
He bound them using their own belts, leaving them for authorities, the dagger reclaimed and set beside the funhouse mirror—one artifact saved from war’s insatiable maw. <words>371</words>
Alone again, he studied his reflection in the antique glass: a fractured man in a fractured place, mastering balance between justice and humanity. <words>394</words>
The wooden bead found its way back into his hand, a silent vow to keep paying war’s price so others wouldn’t have to. <words>414</words>
In the screaming silence, he resumed his vigil, waiting for the next call, the next enemy, the next chance to mend what conflict had broken. <words>438</words>
