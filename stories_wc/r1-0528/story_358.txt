Professor Alistair Finch adjusted his spectacles, the arctic research greenhouse humming around him like a frozen beehive. <words>19</words> Outside the thick, fogged panes, the distant shrieks of children echoed across the ice – playground time amid the desolation. <words>38</words> His old-fashioned robes, smelling faintly of ozone and dried herbs, felt out of place amidst the hydroponic trays of luminous frost-resistant orchids. <words>62</words> On the central workbench, illuminated by a single shaft of weak polar light, lay the fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin, obsidian etched with impossible geometries. <words>86</words> It pulsed with a low, cold thrum, the source of his sanctified dread, a feeling both holy and horrifying. <words>106</words> His motivation was clear, yet daunting: to claim an uncharted frontier, not of land, but of temporal understanding hidden within the artifact. <words>128</words> The fragment wasn't inert; it posed an unfolding riddle, its meaning shifting like the aurora outside. <words>144</words> Alistair’s method was unconventional, born of desperation: seeking answers through ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections scattered throughout the greenhouse – in the glass walls, the polished steel tables, even the curved surface of a watering can. <words>176</words> He moved with a purposefully aimless gait, drifting between mirrors, hoping to catch a glimpse of the riddle's next clue in their fleeting surfaces. <words>197</words> In one frost-rimmed pane, the reflection showed not his own weary face, but a desert vista superimposed over the ice. <words>215</words> Hieroglyphs flared briefly in the condensation on a cold glass shelf, dissolving before he could fully decipher them. <words>232</words> The dread deepened, sanctified by the sheer antiquity brushing against the fragile present. <words>245</words> He needed to anchor himself, to feel something solid against the slipping sands of time the coffin fragment evoked. <words>263</words> Almost instinctively, he reached out and gently, reverently, began to cuddle the cold obsidian shard to his chest, as one might comfort a frightened child. <words>285</words> A shock, not of cold, but of profound connection, vibrated through him. <words>296</words> In the large, curved mirror mounted above a specimen cabinet, his reflection momentarily changed. <words>312</words> Instead of an old mage clutching a relic, he saw a figure clad in linen, kneeling not in a greenhouse, but within a vast, shadowed tomb, hands pressed against a colossal, intact sarcophagus. <words>344</words> The image held a key, a visceral understanding: the frontier wasn't geographical, but the liminal space between life and death, guarded by the pharaoh. <words>368</words> The riddle’s core shifted; it wasn't about unlocking the past, but understanding the threshold the coffin represented. <words>388</words> The children's laughter outside seemed to pierce the dread, a reminder of the persistent, fragile life the arctic greenhouse nurtured. <words>410</words> Claiming this frontier meant becoming its guardian, standing watch at the edge of oblivion, a duty etched with the same sanctified dread that now filled him with a terrible, clear purpose. <words>440</words> He held the fragment tighter, the cold seeping into his bones, a pact sealed in ice and ancient dust. <words>458</words>
