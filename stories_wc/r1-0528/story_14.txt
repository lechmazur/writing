The tidal power monitoring station stood isolated on the coast, its rhythmic hum a counterpoint to the crashing waves. Inside, during his solitary candlelit dinners, Elian, a hopelessly naive gambler, poured melted station wax into his grandmother's rustic candle mold, the grooves worn smooth by generations. He craved the ritual, a fragile bulwark against the station's crushing monotony and his own mounting debts. His motivation was simple, desperate: to capture one last spark before oblivion swallowed him whole, one final win to erase everything. The lectures crackled through the station's ancient speakers, piped in via rebellious midnight broadcasts from unhinged professors railing against societal collapse; their chaotic energy seeped into Elian's bones, whispering that the world was rarely predictable, a game stacked against the timid. Tonight, the wax felt heavier, the flickering light casting long, accusing shadows. An unspoken bargain hung thick in the salty air: he'd use the candle he made tonight only if he won, a silent pact with fate born of superstition and fading hope. The professors ranted about tidal anomalies, their voices distorted, fueling a reckless certainty within him. He abandoned his half-formed candle, the cooling wax a silent reproach, and fled the humming station, drawn towards the town's lone dock shimmering under the pier lights. The salty wind whipped at his face as he reached the dock, the planks slick beneath his worn boots. He found the usual game tucked behind stacked crates, the players' faces grim in the low light. He pushed his last crumpled bills onto the damp wood, the unspoken bargain screaming in his head – win, or the light goes out forever. The cards dealt were cruel, predictable only in their malice, mirroring the professors' dire warnings. He lost. Utterly. The dock seemed to tilt beneath him, the waves sucking greedily at the pilings. A choked sound escaped him, part sob, part disbelieving laugh – laughing tears welled in his eyes as the bitter truth washed over him: oblivion wasn't coming; it was here. The candle back at the station, barely begun, would remain unfinished, its potential spark forever unlit, a final testament to his naive gamble on a world that was rarely predictable. He stared into the churning black water, the professors' distorted voices echoing the chaotic rhythm of the waves, the unspoken bargain broken, the last spark extinguished not by darkness, but by the cold certainty of his own defeat. The dock felt like the edge of the world, and he was stepping off.
