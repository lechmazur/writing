<story>The dog walker, Finn, adjusted his worn leather gloves, the only thing that didn't scream "underpaid" in the cavernous, haunted mansion dining room. <words>21</words> The last rays of the setting sun, when color bleeds from day into night, painted the room in hues of bruised purple and sickly yellow. <words>35</words> He wasn't here for the spectral residents, though; he was here for the botanical collection, a meticulously curated assembly of rare orchids and carnivorous plants, each one a silent testament to the eccentricities of the ultra-rich. <words>58</words> Finn, a man of carefully careless habits, had a silent agreement with the mansion's owner: he'd tend to the dogs, and in return, he could spend his evenings among the plants, a sanctuary where the loud silence of the house didn't feel so oppressive. <words>87</words> Heâ€™d met the owner, a reclusive woman named Ms. Abernathy, at a blood drive, a bizarre encounter that had somehow led to this strange arrangement. <words>104</words> Tonight, however, the usual quiet was disrupted by a new presence: a young woman, pale and trembling, stood near the far wall, her eyes wide with a fear that Finn recognized. <words>125</words> He knew he should ignore her, maintain the silent agreement, but something about her vulnerability made him pause. <words>140</words> "You shouldn't be here," he said, his voice a low rumble that seemed to echo in the vast space. <words>153</words> She flinched, her gaze darting towards the shadows that seemed to writhe in the corners of the room. <words>167</words> "I... I got lost," she stammered, her voice barely a whisper. <words>175</words> Finn knew that was a lie; no one got lost in this house, not without a reason. <words>187</words> He felt a strange urge to justify his own presence, to explain why he, a simple dog walker, was allowed to stand where fear dares not tread. <words>208</words> "I'm here for the plants," he said, gesturing towards the vibrant, almost predatory flora. <words>220</words> "They need care, even in a place like this." <words>229</words> He watched her, trying to gauge her intentions, her fear, and the unspoken story she carried with her. <words>245</words> The silence returned, heavier now, charged with unspoken questions and the weight of the mansion's history. <words>259</words> He knew he was breaking the silent agreement, but for the first time, he didn't care. <words>272</words> He had to know why she was here, why she was so afraid, and why, for some reason, he felt compelled to protect her. <words>292</words> The dogs, usually his only companions in this strange place, were forgotten, their barks replaced by the heavy thrum of his own heart. <words>311</words> He was no longer just a dog walker; he was a guardian, a protector, drawn into a mystery as dark and tangled as the roots of the botanical collection. <words>334</words>
