<story>The apathetic summoner, Elara, yawned, the sound echoing in the cavernous shared dream recording studio. <words>14</words> Dust motes danced in the weak light filtering through the grimy windows, illuminating rows of empty recording booths and the skeletal remains of forgotten technology. <words>30</words> She wasn't here for the tech, though; she was here for the frames. <words>38</words> After the last breath of the dying god, the world had become a patchwork of fragmented realities, and Elara, with her enthusiastically lazy approach to life, had found a peculiar calling. <words>59</words> She wanted to rebuild the coral reefs, not through grand spells or heroic deeds, but through the gentle sharpness of river wisdom. <words>74</words> She believed the river, in its endless flow, held the blueprints for creation, and those blueprints were hidden within the echoes of dreams. <words>91</words> Her method was simple, if tedious: match the empty frames hanging in the deserted hall to the corresponding dream fragments. <words>107</words> Each frame, when properly aligned, would unfold a piece of the river's song, a melody of growth and renewal. <words>122</words> Today, she focused on a particularly stubborn set, their wood warped and faded, mirroring her own lack of enthusiasm. <words>137</words> She picked up her rustic coffee grinder, its handle worn smooth from years of use, and began to grind the beans, the rhythmic sound a counterpoint to the silence of the studio. <words>160</words> The aroma, rich and earthy, filled the air, a small comfort in this desolate place. <words>171</words> As she poured the steaming brew into a chipped mug, she noticed a faint shimmer on one of the frames. <words>187</words> It was a subtle shift, a whisper of movement, and with a sigh, she knew the matching process had begun. <words>201</words> She carefully placed the frame, its edges clicking into place with a satisfying sound, and watched as the empty space filled with a swirling image of a coral reef, vibrant and alive. <words>225</words> The river's song, a gentle hum, resonated through the studio, a promise of life returning to the barren landscapes. <words>240</words> Elara, despite her apathy, felt a flicker of something akin to hope, a quiet satisfaction in the unfolding of the world, one frame at a time. <words>261</words> She took a sip of her coffee, the bitterness a welcome contrast to the sweetness of the dream, and prepared to match the next frame, her lazy enthusiasm a constant companion. <words>285</words> The task was endless, but the river's wisdom, she knew, was worth the effort, even for an apathetic summoner. <words>300</words>
