<story>Sister Agnes, an exorcist whose hands trembled more before a crowd than a demon, clutched the pressed wildflowers, their fragile beauty a stark contrast to the orbital debris swirling outside the observation deck. <words>27</words> These weren't just any flowers; they were a legacy, a tangible piece of her family's "never usual" history, a history built on the inheritance of lies. <words>45</words> Her grandmother, a woman whispered to have communed with the stars, had left them, along with a cryptic journal detailing rituals performed amid toy assembly, a time when the veil between worlds was said to be thinnest. <words>72</words> Agnes, despite her stage fright, felt a defiant hush settle over her; she wouldn't let fear dictate her path, not anymore. <words>88</words> The journal spoke of a specific method, a way to submerge oneself into the ethereal plane: by the sound of a key turning in a lock, a sound that resonated with the unlocking of secrets. <words>113</words> Today, amid the clatter of robotic arms assembling miniature spaceships, she would attempt the ritual, not to banish a demon, but to sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never,” to rewrite the narrative her family had been trapped in. <words>145</words> She found the lock, an old, tarnished thing salvaged from a forgotten space station, and with trembling fingers, inserted the key. <words>161</words> The metallic click echoed through the observation deck, a sharp, definitive sound that seemed to vibrate through her very bones. <words>177</words> As the sound faded, the orbital debris outside seemed to shift, the stars themselves rearranging into a new constellation, a testament to the power of intention. <words>198</words> Agnes closed her eyes, the pressed wildflowers pressed against her chest, and allowed herself to be pulled into the unknown, the defiant hush now a roar of potential. <words>220</words> She wasn't just an exorcist; she was a sculptor of realities, a weaver of new destinies, and the key had just turned. <words>238</words> The lies of her inheritance would not define her; she would define them, one defiant act at a time, one key turn at a time. <words>259</words> The fear was still there, a cold knot in her stomach, but it was overshadowed by a fierce determination, a burning desire to finally understand the truth behind the whispers and the wildflowers. <words>287</words> She would submerge herself in the truth, no matter how strange or terrifying, and emerge, not as a victim of her past, but as the architect of her future. <words>312</words> The toy assembly continued, oblivious to the cosmic shift, but for Agnes, everything had changed, the "never" now a canvas of infinite possibilities. <words>333</words> The orbital debris, once a symbol of chaos, now seemed to dance in harmony with her newfound purpose, a silent promise of the extraordinary journey ahead. <words>355</words>
