<story>The forthright peddler, Silas, his face etched with the joyful loneliness of a man who’d seen too much starlight, entered the abandoned space station medical bay. <words>22</words> The universe hummed its secret song, a low thrum that vibrated through the metal floor, as he carefully placed his worn satchel down. <words>36</words> Inside, nestled amongst his meager wares, was a dried flower bouquet, its colors faded but still holding a hint of the vibrant life they once possessed. <words>52</words> Silas, though meekly assertive, had a purpose here, a path to redemption he’d been charting for years. <words>64</words> He wasn't here to sell; he was here to divide, to break an oath sealed in blood, an oath that had haunted him like a phantom limb. <words>80</words> He began by sifting through rumor-laden gossip columns, digital remnants of the station's past, searching for the names of those he had wronged. <words>97</words> Each name he found was a weight lifted, a step further from the darkness that had clung to him. <words>110</words> He would divide the bouquet, petal by petal, assigning each to a person he had harmed, a symbolic gesture of his remorse. <words>126</words> The medical bay, once a place of sterile efficiency, now echoed with the soft rustle of dried petals and the quiet determination of a man seeking absolution. <words>144</words> He imagined their faces, some angry, some sad, but all deserving of his acknowledgment. <words>156</words> He carefully separated a crimson rose, its edges brittle, for the captain he had betrayed, a man who had trusted him implicitly. <words>173</words> A delicate bluebell went to the engineer whose designs he had stolen, a theft that had cost her years of work. <words>189</words> A sprig of lavender, its scent still faintly lingering, was for the medic whose life he had endangered through his recklessness. <words>206</words> As he divided the bouquet, the joyful loneliness within him began to shift, replaced by a quiet sense of peace. <words>221</words> The universe continued its song, now a little brighter, a little more hopeful, as Silas completed his task. <words>235</words> He knew his journey wasn't over, but he had taken the first step, a step guided by the whispers of the past and the promise of a better future. <words>257</words> He gathered the petals, each a testament to his past mistakes and his present resolve, and scattered them across the cold metal floor. <words>276</words> The abandoned medical bay, once a symbol of despair, now held the seeds of his redemption, scattered like stardust in the vast emptiness. <words>294</words> Silas, the forthright peddler, now a man on a path, left the station, the universe humming a slightly different tune, a tune of forgiveness and hope. <words>314</words>
