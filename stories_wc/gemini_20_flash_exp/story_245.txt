<story>The irate smuggler, Jax, pounded his worn boots against the cracked durasteel of the abandoned spaceport flight deck, his breath misting in the pre-dawn chill. <words>19</words> He was jogging, a ritual he despised, but one that his abstractly physical heart demanded, a revolt against the sedentary life of a space-lane hustler. <words>37</words> He wasn't looking for fitness; he was searching for something more, something whispered in the old legends of hidden waterfalls cascading down the forgotten cliffs beyond the port. <words>58</words> Today, he was determined to find them, or at least find a sign. <words>67</words> He pulled a single chopstick from his pocket, a relic from a long-gone noodle bar on a planet he barely remembered, its smooth surface worn smooth with use. <words>89</words> He’d always carried it, a strange comfort in the chaos of his life. <words>99</words> He stopped, his chest heaving, and pulled a flask of bitter, dark tea from his belt. <words>111</words> He poured the tea into a chipped metal cup, the leaves swirling in a chaotic dance. <words>122</words> This was his method, his way to memorialize the past and glimpse the future, reading the patterns in the tea leaves like a forgotten oracle. <words>141</words> He swirled the cup again, his eyes narrowed, his biting sincerity a shield against the absurdity of it all. <words>156</words> The leaves formed a jagged line, a path, not to the waterfalls, but to a specific docking bay, one he’d never noticed before. <words>174</words> His heart, still in revolt, pounded with a different kind of urgency now, a mix of hope and suspicion. <words>189</words> He knew, with a certainty that surprised even him, that the waterfalls weren't the only thing hidden here. <words>204</words> He tucked the chopstick back into his pocket, a silent promise to the past, and started towards the docking bay, his jog now a determined stride. <words>223</words> The tea leaves had spoken, and Jax, the irate smuggler, was finally listening to the heart's strange, abstract language. <words>238</words> He wasn't just looking for waterfalls anymore; he was looking for something that had been lost, something he didn't even know he was missing. <words>258</words> The abandoned spaceport, once a symbol of his aimless wandering, now felt like a map, a guide to a destination he couldn't yet name. <words>278</words> He felt a strange sense of purpose, a feeling he hadn't experienced in years, and it was all thanks to a single chopstick and a cup of tea. <words>299</words> The heart's revolt, it seemed, could lead to the most unexpected places. <words>309</words>
