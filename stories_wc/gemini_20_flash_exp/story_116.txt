<story>The dismayed minstrel, Silas, adjusted his lute, the broken watch band catching the dim light of the black velvet sky-lounge. <words>18</words> He wasn't playing tonight; his subjectively rational mind was preoccupied with something far more important than melodies. <words>30</words> Below, the endless city pulsed with a million lights, a chaotic canvas he desperately wanted to understand. <words>41</words> He’d decided to excavate the secrets of this place, not with shovels, but with the faded polaroid photographs scattered across his table. <words>56</words> Each image, a fragment of a forgotten garden, hinted at a hidden order, a pattern within the endless night. <words>68</words> Silas, with a laconic exuberance, believed these gardens were the key to drawing a map of this impossible realm. <words>81</words> He traced the edges of a photo, a close-up of a peculiar flower, its petals like tiny, drawn boundaries. <words>94</words> He knew that these boundaries, though invisible to most, were the very structure of this floating world. <words>106</words> He’d spent weeks studying them, each photograph a clue, each garden a piece of the puzzle. <words>118</words> The broken watch band, a constant reminder of time’s irrelevance here, felt strangely comforting. <words>129</words> He wasn't bound by the clock, only by the need to understand the endless night and its garden secrets. <words>142</words> He flipped through another photo, a wider shot showing the garden's layout, a complex web of paths and hedges. <words>156</words> He meticulously marked the angles and distances on a large parchment, his map slowly taking shape. <words>168</words> The city below seemed to fade as he focused, the black velvet sky-lounge becoming his own private observatory. <words>181</words> He wasn't just a minstrel anymore; he was an explorer, charting the unknown with photographs and a broken watch band. <words>195</words> He felt a surge of excitement, a laconic exuberance bubbling up as he connected another piece of the puzzle. <words>209</words> He was close, he could feel it, the map of the endless night was almost within his grasp. <words>221</words> He knew that the gardens held the key to understanding the drawn boundaries of this world, and he would find them. <words>235</words> He would excavate the truth, one photograph, one garden secret at a time, until the map was complete. <words>249</words> The dismayed minstrel, now a determined cartographer, continued his work, the broken watch band a silent witness to his quest. <words>264</words> He was driven by a need to understand, to bring order to the chaos, to map the endless night. <words>277</words> He was subjectively rational, yes, but his passion was anything but, fueled by the mystery of the gardens. <words>290</words> He would continue to excavate, to study, to map, until the secrets of the endless night were revealed. <words>303</words> The black velvet sky-lounge was his sanctuary, the polaroids his guide, and the broken watch band his constant companion. <words>317</words> He was a minstrel no more, but a cartographer of the impossible, driven by a laconic exuberance and a thirst for knowledge. <words>332</words> He would draw the boundaries of the endless night, one garden secret at a time, until the map was complete. <words>345</words>
