<story>The bruised fighter, knuckles still throbbing from a fight he barely remembered, stumbled through the dusty attic. <words>15</words> Clockwork animals, their gears whirring softly, watched him with vacant glass eyes. <words>23</words> He wasn't here for them, though; he was here for the shard. <words>30</words> A clay pot shard, tucked beneath a pile of moth-eaten tapestries, its surface etched with an inscription he couldn't quite decipher. <words>43</words> It was a symbol, he knew, of the self-deception he’d clung to for too long. <words>52</words> He was, after all, skillfully incompetent, a fighter who always seemed to lose the fights that mattered. <words>62</words> He’d been told the shard held the key to his true self, a self he’d buried beneath layers of bravado and regret. <words>75</words> The attic, he’d learned, was a gateway, a place where forgotten dreams lingered, and it was through these dreams that he would abduct the truth. <words>90</words> He closed his eyes, the scent of dust and old wood filling his nostrils, and focused on the inscription. <words>100</words> He felt a pull, a dizzying sensation as the attic seemed to dissolve around him, replaced by a swirling vortex of colors and half-formed images. <words>116</words> He saw himself, not as the bruised fighter, but as a boy, full of hope, standing for something, something he’d long forgotten. <words>129</words> The vision was fleeting, a whisper of what could have been, and then it was gone, leaving him back in the attic, the shard clutched tightly in his hand. <words>147</words> He knew what he had to do, the moment the sculptor’s chisel first struck marble, a new statue would be born, and with it, his old self would die. <words>165</words> He would no longer be the fighter who lost, but the man who stood for something, even if it was just the truth about himself. <words>180</words> The close distance he felt to his past was now a chasm he was ready to cross. <words>190</words> He would extinguish the last vestige of self-deception, even if it meant facing the pain of his own failures. <words>202</words> He would use the shard, not as a weapon, but as a mirror, reflecting the man he was meant to be. <words>214</words> The clockwork animals continued their silent vigil, their gears ticking away the seconds as he prepared to face his own truth. <words>227</words> He knew the journey would be painful, but it was a journey he had to take. <words>237</words> He would no longer be a prisoner of his own lies. <words>245</words> He would stand for something, even if it was just the truth. <words>254</words> The attic, once a place of forgotten dreams, was now the starting point of his new reality. <words>265</words> He looked at the shard, the inscription now clearer, a map to his own soul. <words>275</words> He was ready to abduct his true self from the depths of his own self-deception. <words>286</words> The moment the chisel struck, he would be reborn. <words>293</words> He would finally stand for something real. <words>300</words>
