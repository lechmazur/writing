<story>The ruthless flower arranger, Agnes, adjusted a wilting lily, her gaze sharp despite the polite anarchy that usually defined her interactions. <words>17</words> She wasn't here for the flowers, not really; they were merely a distraction, a cover for her true purpose. <words>30</words> Agnes pulled a scuffed plastic comb from her pocket, its teeth worn smooth from years of nervous fidgeting. <words>42</words> She was intellectually spontaneous, her mind a whirlwind of connections, and the comb was a physical manifestation of that restless energy. <words>56</words> Today, that energy was focused on the mysterious stone circle before her, the ancient rocks whispering secrets she was determined to hear. <words>70</words> A folk singer strummed a melancholic tune nearby, and Agnes knew her window was small, the pause between verses her only chance. <words>85</words> She needed to distinguish the true meaning of the rock art etched into the stones, to decode the symbols that had haunted her dreams. <words>101</words> The watcher’s burden, she called it, this compulsion to understand, to see beyond the surface. <words>112</words> Agnes approached a young couple, their faces illuminated by the setting sun, and began a conversation, her questions seemingly random, yet carefully crafted. <words>129</words> "Do you ever feel like the stones are watching you?" she asked, her tone conversational, yet probing. <words>141</words> The couple exchanged a confused glance, but Agnes pressed on, her mind already racing, connecting their responses to the patterns on the rocks. <words>157</words> She learned of their dreams, their fears, their mundane lives, each detail a piece of the puzzle she was assembling. <words>171</words> Through spontaneous road trip conversations with other visitors, Agnes gathered fragments of stories, each one a potential key to unlocking the circle's secrets. <words>188</words> A farmer spoke of ancient rituals, a child described a dream of flying stones, and a historian mentioned a forgotten language. <words>203</words> Agnes listened intently, her comb clicking softly in her hand, her mind weaving these disparate threads into a tapestry of meaning. <words>219</words> The singer began another verse, the music a gentle reminder of the fleeting time, but Agnes had found what she sought. <words>234</words> The rock art wasn't a map or a warning, but a reflection of the human experience, a testament to the shared burden of observation. <words>251</words> The stones weren't watching, they were mirroring, and Agnes, the ruthless flower arranger, had finally understood. <words>264</words> She smiled, a rare, genuine smile, the weight of the watcher’s burden momentarily lifted, replaced by a quiet sense of understanding. <words>280</words> The comb fell silent in her hand, its purpose fulfilled, as she turned to face the setting sun, the stone circle now a familiar friend. <words>298</words>
