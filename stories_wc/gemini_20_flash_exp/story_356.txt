<story>Old Man Hemlock, the ship's wry caretaker, leaned against a stack of deactivated laser cannons, his gaze fixed on the single porthole in the cargo hold. <words>19</words> He was warmly aloof, a man who’d seen too many suns rise and fall to be bothered by the usual pirate bluster. <words>34</words> A piece of chalk, worn smooth with use, lay nestled in his calloused palm. <words>45</words> He’d been using it to trace the paths of the clouds outside, a strange habit for a space pirate ship, but Hemlock wasn’t like the others. <words>62</words> He wasn’t interested in plunder or glory, only in the quiet rhythm of the cosmos, the way time seemed to bend and fold like a well-worn map. <words>81</words> The ship’s outdated phone, a relic from a forgotten era, suddenly emitted a dial tone, a jarring sound in the otherwise silent hold. <words>98</words> It cut out abruptly, the silence that followed thick and heavy, like a shroud. <words>108</words> Hemlock sighed, the sound barely audible above the hum of the ship’s engines. <words>118</words> He hated the “what if” siren song that always followed the silence, the endless possibilities that time offered, each one a potential regret. <words>137</words> He’d learned long ago that the only way to hush that song was to step outside of it, to find the cracks in the fabric of time itself. <words>158</words> He closed his eyes, the chalk still clutched in his hand, and focused on the cloud paths he’d been tracing, the swirling patterns a key to something more. <words>178</words> He felt a familiar pull, a gentle harshness that tugged at his very being, and with a soft sigh, he began to vanish. <words>196</words> Not in a puff of smoke or a flash of light, but slowly, like a drawing being erased, his form fading into the very fabric of the ship. <words>217</words> The chalk fell to the floor, a small white smudge against the metal plating, the only evidence that he had ever been there. <words>234</words> The pirates, when they eventually came to the cargo hold, would find nothing amiss, just the usual clutter and the lingering scent of ozone. <words>253</words> They wouldn’t understand the quiet magic that had just unfolded, the way Hemlock had slipped through the cracks of time, leaving behind only the echo of his presence. <words>275</words> He was gone, not dead, but simply elsewhere, a whisper in the wind, a ripple in the cosmic sea, finally free from the tyranny of “what if”. <words>298</words>
