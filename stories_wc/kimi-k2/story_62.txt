I tell the children of Orchard Amphitheater that I once taught Plato how to lie, which is rarely honest of me, but candor never filled a punctured plastic cup. <words>29</words>
They sit on the living branches that serve as seats, knees knocking bark, waiting for the bedtime story I promised after the final goodbye to their parents. <words>25</words>
I live beneath them, in the sewer pipe that drains runoff from these same trees, a wannabe philosopher who smells of rot and overripe apples. <words>21</words>
Tonight I am humble, because the moon is low and the wind carries the scent of bruised fruit, reminding me that even the mundane can bruise. <words>24</words>
I hold the punctured plastic cup like a chalice; it once held cider, now it holds nothing, a perfect metaphor for existence, or so I claim. <words>23</words>
“Listen,” I begin, voice soft as mold, “to how the world was rewritten by a leak.” <words>14</words>
Long ago, I say, the orchard was a city of glass where every thought was visible, and honesty was law. <words>18</words>
But a single puncture in a single cup let a single drop escape, and the drop carried a secret: that truth is only the loudest lie. <words>25</words>
The glass cracked along that whisper, streets shattered, and the shards grew into these apple trees, their branches shaped like amphitheater seats so survivors could watch the next performance. <words>28</words>
The children shiver; the story is chilling, as intended, because bedtime stories should lower the temperature of certainty. <words>18</words>
I tell them the sewer below is the original crack, that I slid down it to study the code of existence written in runoff and rat footprints. <words>23</words>
Every night I edit that code, scratching new rules on the pipe walls with the jagged rim of this same punctured cup. <words>21</words>
Rule one: what leaks can also irrigate. <words>7</words>
Rule two: rot composes sweeter songs than glass. <words>9</words>
Rule three: rarely be honest, or the glass will reform and trap you. <words>13</words>
A small girl raises her hand, apple blossom in her hair, and asks if any of this is true. <words>18</words>
I smile the candid deceit I have perfected, the smile of a man who has nothing left to lose after the final goodbye. <words>21</words>
“Truth,” I say, “is the seed; the story is the cider; the cup is the world; the hole is you.” <words>19</words>
She nods, satisfied, because children understand metaphor better than adults understand mortgage rates. <words>15</words>
I send them home with the whisper that tomorrow the branches might rearrange themselves into a new sentence, and they believe me, because they want the code rewritten as much as I do. <words>29</words>
When the last sandal vanishes up the slope, I crawl back through the grate, humble again, carrying the punctured plastic cup like a lantern that leaks light. <words>25</words>
Somewhere above, an apple falls, and I catch its thud in my chest, another drop to add to the endless revision of the mundane. <words>23</words>
