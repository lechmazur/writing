The sea-foam recollectionist, whose name was Lira, stepped into the iridescent cave inside the giant crystal geode just before memory fades, her boots crunching on shards of crater glass that had fallen from the ceiling like frozen tears. [42]
Each sliver of crater glass transliterates emotions, and as Lira knelt to gather them, the fragments hummed with the cheerful gloom of every traveler who had ever wandered here seeking missing pieces of themselves. [60]
She pressed a palm-sized shard to her cheek and felt the bittersweet ache of a sailor who once lost his compass in these very tunnels, the glass turning warm with his gratitude for the mystery rather than his despair. [80]
Lira’s gift was to conjecture the shape of vanished paths via the scattered seeds dropped by a migrating bird, a silver-winged courier whose yearly passage stitched sky to stone. [100]
This year the bird had scattered only three seeds, each glowing faintly like miniature moons, and Lira knew that before memory fades she must plant them in the exact spots where paths used to be. [120]
She traced the cave wall with fingertips still tingling from the sailor’s story, searching for the hairline cracks that once were doorways, humming a tune that matched the cheerful gloom thrumming through the geode’s heart. [140]
The first seed she pressed into a hollow shaped like a question mark; it sprouted instantly into a vine of light that spelled out the word “why” in looping cursive before dissolving into stardust. [160]
Lira smiled at the familiar answer, because every recollectionist learns early that the question is always the same: to discover why some paths disappear. [180]
The second seed she tucked beneath a fallen prism; it unfolded into a memory of the migrating bird as a fledgling, pecking at crater glass and tasting every emotion the cave had ever swallowed. [200]
In that memory the bird chirped a note of such cheerful gloom that Lira laughed and cried at once, understanding that the cave itself was alive and sometimes simply rolled over in its sleep, erasing corridors like dreams. [220]
She cradled the third seed, the last, and felt the weight of missing pieces settle on her tongue like salt. [235]
Before memory fades, she whispered, “Show me the path that mattered most,” and planted the seed at the center of the geode where the light was brightest and the shadows deepest. [255]
The seed cracked open not into a vine but into a mirror of crater glass, and in its surface Lira saw herself as a child, chasing the migrating bird across a beach that no longer existed. [275]
The child-Lira held a shard identical to the one now in the recollectionist’s hand, and the glass transliterated the wonder of that day into the woman’s chest until her ribs rang like bells. [295]
She understood then that the missing pieces were not corridors or doorways but moments of pure feeling, crystallized by the cave and carried away by wings. [315]
The cheerful gloom deepened, a lullaby of bright sorrow, as the mirror dissolved and the migrating bird itself appeared, grown now, feathers edged in crater glass. [335]
It landed on Lira’s shoulder, light as a secret, and dropped a single new seed into her palm, warm with the promise of next year’s questions. [355]
Lira bowed, honoring the cycle, and tucked the seed behind her ear where it pulsed like a second heartbeat. [370]
She walked back through the iridescent cave, no longer searching for vanished paths because she now carried their essence: every emotion the geode had ever sung, every story the bird had ever carried. [395]
Outside, the sky was the color of sea foam at dusk, and the migrating bird rose in a spiral of silver, scattering a fresh trail of seeds across the darkening world. [415]
Lira watched until the last glimmer vanished, then turned toward home, her pockets full of crater glass that transliterated the cheerful gloom into a quiet, steady hope. [435]
She would return next year, before memory fades, to plant the new seed and conjecture again why some paths disappear, knowing the answer would change shape like light inside a crystal. [460]
For now, the missing pieces were no longer lost but shared between cave, bird, and recollectionist, a three-note chord humming beneath the skin of the world. [480]
As she walked, the shards in her pockets clinked softly, each one a syllable in the long sentence the geode was still writing, a story that would never end as long as someone remembered to listen. [505]
And though the cheerful gloom lingered, it was no longer heavy; it was the weight of every beautiful thing that had ever been and ever would be,
