In the hush just before the condemned building is demolished, the tree trunk library hollowed by a scholar’s guild stands motionless, its bark breathing with centuries of ink and dust. [34]  
Inside, the face blind portrait artist, known only as Lira, kneels beneath the last intact skylight, her palette of oils reduced to the color of dusk. [52]  
She cannot recognize a single human face, yet she paints them with fractally precise strokes, each pore and eyelash a spiral of smaller spirals, as if memory could be rebuilt from geometry alone. [73]  
Tonight she has come not to paint flesh but to craft a mirror of the sky inside these walls before the wrecking ball erases them at dawn. [90]  
Across the warped floorboards lies the secret book safe, its spine disguised as an unmarked folio on celestial navigation, wedged between treatises on extinct moths. [110]  
Lira pries it open; inside waits a single copper coin blackened by age, its edges scalloped like a dried leaf. [125]  
She lifts it to the skylight and tilts it until faint indentations appear—microscopic ridges left by a scholar who once pressed the coin against wet parchment to encode a map of constellations. [148]  
Those indentations are the only surviving record of the sky as it looked the night the guild swore to keep knowledge free. [165]  
Lira’s fingertips glide over the coin, translating each bump into pigment, each valley into shadow, her brush moving in the heightened stillness that precedes collapse. [185]  
She begins to paint directly onto the concave inner wall of the trunk, spiraling outward from the coin’s pattern, stars blooming like frost. [203]  
Every star she renders is itself a miniature galaxy, fractally precise, so that leaning close one sees planets within planets, libraries within libraries, each shelf holding another coin. [225]  
Time narrows; the demolition crew’s floodlights already probe the stained-glass windows like predatory eyes. [240]  
Lira’s heart races, but her hand remains steady, discovering limits she never knew: the limit of pigment to hold light, the limit of wall to hold memory, the limit of her blindness to recognize the faces she paints into nebulae. [265]  
She realizes she is painting not strangers but the guild members themselves, their features dissolved into cosmic dust yet still present in the curve of a comet or the tilt of a moon. [285]  
The coin grows warm against her palm, as if the old scholar’s pulse still flickers inside the metal. [298]  
She presses it to the wet paint; the indentations transfer, leaving a perfect negative relief of the night sky embossed upon the mural. [315]  
A low groan ripples through the trunk as the first hydraulic claw bites the outer bark. [327]  
Lira steps back, her eyes unable to see the faces she has hidden in the stars, but knowing they are there because the air itself shivers with recognition. [345]  
The mural begins to glow, not with light but with the hush of absolute attention, the heightened stillness of a moment balanced on the edge of vanishing. [363]  
She understands now that to mirror the sky inside walls is not to copy but to reveal what was always there: the universe compressed into a seed, waiting for demolition to plant it elsewhere. [385]  
She closes the secret book safe, slips the coin into her pocket, and walks out as the first beam crashes through the roof. [400]  
Behind her, the painted stars fracture into motes that drift upward, each mote a page, each page a promise that knowledge outlives its containers. [420]  
Outside, the sky above the condemned site is cloudless, indifferent, yet for an instant Lira sees her own mural reflected there, fractally precise, the constellations rearranged into faces she will never know but will forever paint. [445]  
The building folds inward like a closing book, and the hush deepens into silence so complete it feels like the inside of a coin pressed against the ear of the world. [465]  
Lira walks on, her pockets heavier by one ancient coin, her mind lighter by one limit discovered and transcended. [480]  
In the distance, sirens keen, but she hears only the faint indentations of stars calling her to the next hollow tree, the next wall, the next sky waiting to be mirrored from within. [500]  
She smiles, face blind yet visionary, and begins to craft again, brush already moving in the air, tracing constellations no telescope has yet resolved. [520]  
The scholar’s guild is gone, its library splinters, yet every shard carries a fragment of the mural, seeds of light sown among the ruins.
