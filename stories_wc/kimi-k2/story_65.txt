The slapdash bard, pockets jangling with broken strings and half-written verses, arrived at the brass doorplate hammered into the basalt at the tectonic plate edge, where the continent sighed open like an old wound. <words>34</words>
He knelt, tracing the tarnished letters that read “Threshold of the Possibly Impossible,” and felt the ground beneath him tremble with the same rhythm as his failing heart. <words>29</words>
Every seventh generation, his family had spread a checkered cloth on this exact fissure for a picnic, claiming the spot was sacred because nothing else stayed still long enough to be holy. <words>29</words>
Today, the hourglass strapped to his lute case flipped itself, sand beginning its slow crawl back to the bulb that had just emptied, resetting time for the length of one meal. <words>29</words>
He unpacked the basket left by his grandmother: black bread, salt fish, and a single violet preserved in sugar, each bite a verse in the elegy he would never finish. <words>28</words>
Death, wearing the face of a crow, perched on the brass doorplate and watched with polite hunger, talons clicking like a metronome. <words>22</words>
The bard toasted the bird with plum wine, singing off-key about the melancholic glee of living just long enough to taste the last sweetness. <words>23</words>
Between mouthfuls he told the crow how the family tradition began when an ancestor traded a lullaby for one hour of borrowed life, and how every picnic since paid interest on that impossible debt. <words>32</words>
The fissure exhaled steam scented with sulfur and memory; the bard felt the pull of the abyss, gentle as a lullaby, promising rest. <words>24</words>
He strummed a chord that made the brass doorplate vibrate, the note bending space until the sacred space widened into a doorway framed by drifting sand. <words>25</words>
With a wink at the crow, he stepped across, disrupting the bargain by refusing to leave the meal unfinished, crumbs still clinging to his lips like unfinished refrains. <words>27</words>
The hourglass shuddered, sand reversing again, grains climbing upward in glittering defiance of gravity and graves. <words>19</words>
Death flapped once, confused, then settled beside the empty cloth, pecking at a leftover crust while the bard’s footprints glowed on the far side of the threshold. <words>26</words>
On the other side, the bard found no paradise, only another edge where continents dreamed of drifting apart, and he laughed, because escape was just another verse in the same endless song. <words>31</words>
He set the brass doorplate upright in the new ground, hammering it with a tuning fork until it rang like a bell, inviting the next wanderer to picnic while the hourglass reset its sand. <words>31</words>
Behind him, the crow cawed a countermelody, and the fissure sang back, sealing itself with the melancholic glee of stories that refuse to end even when the music stops. <words>27</words>
