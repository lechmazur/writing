The experimental weather station on Cape Wrath hummed with spongey dread, its walls sweating salt and ozone after the jet stream shifted south and never returned. [34]  
Inside, idealistic map librarian Lila Quince arranged atlases whose coastlines had already gone obsolete. [46]  
She worked nervously confident, fingers trembling yet sure as she slid drawers shut on continents that no longer existed. [60]  
Between barometric drums she kept a copper nail from a coffin—her great-grandmother’s, pried loose before the sea claimed the graveyard. [78]  
The nail was proof of a reversible exile: the drowned could still be summoned if the living spoke the right words. [93]  
Each dusk Lila opened water-stained journals salvaged from a shipwreck off the Hebrides, pages tattooed with coded stanzas that fluttered like trapped moths. [114]  
She believed the verses held coordinates to the place where exile could be turned inside out, where the banished might walk back onto solid land. [134]  
Tonight the barographs clicked faster, needles jittering as if the station itself questioned the coming storm. [152]  
Lila whispered the first stanza—“Salt remembers the shape of ankles”—and the copper nail warmed against her palm. [171]  
The second stanza—“Wind knots the names it refuses to carry”—made the lights flicker, shadows pooling like spilled ink. [190]  
She paced the instrument room, nervously confident that bravery ran in her marrow, though history books had reduced her ancestor to a footnote labeled “mutineer.” [213]  
Great-grandmother Morag had led a crew onto forbidden currents, chasing rumors of a second jet stream hidden above the first; the Admiralty called it desertion and erased her charts. [240]  
Lila’s motivation was simple: honor that overlooked bravery by finishing the map Morag died to begin. [258]  
She aligned the copper nail with the station’s brass meridian ring, feeling it tug like a compass needle toward something breathing beneath the floorboards. [280]  
The third stanza—“Exile is only weather wearing a different face”—unlocked a hatch beneath the anemometer, revealing a spiral stair descending into darkness that smelled of kelp and wet iron. [308]  
She descended, counting steps in the same meter as the stanzas, spongey dread oozing up her calves like rising tide. [328]  
At the bottom lay a chamber lined with mirrors fogged by condensation; each reflected her holding the nail, but the reflections aged backward, growing younger until Morag herself stood at the center. [358]  
The ancestor’s lips moved without sound, forming the question Lila had come to ask: “Will you trade your place for mine?” [380]  
Reversible exile required an exchange: one soul ashore, one adrift, balanced like pressure systems on either side of a front. [401]  
Lila’s nervously confident heart stuttered; she had imagined rescue, not substitution. [415]  
She pressed the copper nail into the mirror, and Morag’s hand emerged solid, warm, smelling of tar and heather. [435]  
The station above groaned as the jet stream’s ghost tried to reassert its old path, winds battering the walls like fists. [456]  
Coded stanzas flared across the mirrors, rearranging into a new map: a thin ribbon of air looping back north, a corridor home. [478]  
Lila realized the shipwrecked journals had never been wrecked at all; they were messages in bottles thrown forward in time, waiting for a reader brave enough to answer. [505]  
She looked at Morag, saw the same stubborn hope, and understood bravery wasn’t a single act but a lineage of questions asked in the face of storms. [532]  
Lila stepped aside, letting Morag pass, but held onto the copper nail, its point now blunted by shared warmth. [551]  
The mirrors sealed, leaving only her reflection—older, sea-etched, wearing Morag’s coat. [565]  
She climbed the stairs back into the station, where instruments sang in unfamiliar harmonies, the jet stream’s new path scrawled across fresh charts. [588]  
Outside, clouds gathered in shapes that resembled archipelagos no atlas had ever named. [605]  
Lila pinned the copper nail above the doorframe, a quiet vow that exile, like weather, could always be reversed by those willing to read the wind’s own journals. [635]  
She resumed her post, nervously confident, ready to question every map that claimed a boundary was permanent. [656]  
Somewhere beyond the breakers, Morag sailed the corrected current, sending back coded stanzas in the form of temperature anomalies and
