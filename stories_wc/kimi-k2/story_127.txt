In the brass-and-velvet steampunk lounge called The Cog & Siren, the street performer known only as Larkin waited between calls, fingers drumming a silent tattoo on the rusted knight’s gauntlet that served as his tip-jar. <words>37</words>
The gauntlet had once belonged to Sir Caldus, the knight who had sworn to destroy Larkin’s clan; now its iron fingers were curled in permanent supplication, collecting coins for songs of peace. <words>30</words>
Larkin was creatively blocked, every melody collapsing into the same minor chord of guilt, the same question: how do you forgive the man who killed your sister when he is already dead? <words>29</words>
Between calls, when the lounge’s steam pipes hissed like dying swans, Larkin would remember the coral reef off the coast of Meridia, the place where he and Caldus had first spoken as enemies. <words>28</words>
He closed his eyes and let the texture of that reef guide him: the rasp of staghorn against his palm, the slick give of brain coral, the secret pulse of anemone like a heartbeat beneath armor. <words>29</words>
Each sensation was a code, a desperate semaphore spelling out the words he had never said: I see the fear inside your oath, brother. <words>23</words>
The lounge’s airship-clock chimed eleven; another call would come soon, another crowd hungry for distraction. <words>17</words>
Larkin lifted the gauntlet, feeling the rust flake away like dried blood, revealing the dents where Caldus’s sword had parried his own. <words>23</words>
He remembered the final duel on the reef, how the knight’s visor had lifted for one unguarded moment, revealing eyes the color of shallow water over sand. <words>26</words>
In that moment, Larkin had seen not an adversary but a mirror, both of them bound by vows older than their hatred. <words>21</words>
The memory flooded him now, not as pain but as possibility; he pressed the gauntlet’s palm against his cheek, letting the coral’s remembered texture rewrite the story. <words>26</words>
Trust renewed, he realized, was not forgetting the wound but choosing to carry it differently. <words>17</words>
He set the gauntlet upright, dropped a single silver gear inside—payment for the song he was about to sing—and stepped onto the small stage. <words>25</words>
The lounge fell silent, gears ticking like anxious hearts. <words>9</words>
Larkin sang not of victory or vengeance, but of two men standing knee-deep in tide, armor rusting, learning the shape of each other’s sorrow. <words>26</words>
Each note carried the texture of coral: rough where grief scraped, smooth where forgiveness grew. <words>17</words>
When the last chord faded, the gauntlet overflowed with coins, but Larkin’s eyes were on the empty stool across from him, as if Sir Caldus might sit down and finally rest. <words>30</words>
Between calls, peace had been offered, not to the dead knight, but to the living man who had carried him like a blade in the heart. <words>25</words>
