The mournful troubadour arrived at the echo chamber testing site carrying only his lute and the embroidered collar that once circled the throat of the woman who taught him every song he wished he could forget. <words>34</words>
Amid silent struggles that pressed against his ribs like a second heartbeat, he stepped into the circular room where sound went to die and be reborn as something hollow. <words>27</words>
The collar's threads depicted constellations in silver and indigo, each star a promise she had whispered before vanishing into the same nothingness he now pursued. <words>25</words>
He had learned that her disappearance was strangely predictable—every seventh year she left, every seventh year she returned, until the seventh cycle when she did not. <words>26</words>
Tonight marked seven years since that final absence. <words>7</words>
The chamber's walls were smooth obsidian, reflecting his face back at him in fragments that refused to assemble into anything recognizable. <words>19</words>
He began to play, not for beauty but for demolition, each note designed to demystify the space between memory and forgetting. <words>21</words>
The embroidered collar grew warm against his palm as the music spiraled outward, seeking the heartbeat of nothingness that had swallowed her whole. <words>23</words>
Instead of echoes, the chamber offered silence so complete it had texture, like velvet soaked in absence. <words>17</words>
Following star trails that existed only in the collar's weave, he walked the chamber's perimeter, his footsteps creating patterns that matched the constellation's geometry. <words>24</words>
Each step forward required surrendering another piece of their shared history—the first song she taught him, the last argument they had, the way her pulse had felt against his wrist. <words>31</words>
The intimate detachment of the space allowed him to observe these memories as if they belonged to someone else, a stranger wearing his face. <words>22</words>
At the chamber's heart, he found what the collar had been guiding him toward: a small depression in the floor shaped exactly like the embroidered constellation, where sound itself seemed to originate and expire. <words>32</words>
He placed the collar within the depression and watched as the silver threads began to pulse with light, each star awakening in sequence. <words>23</words>
The mournful troubadour understood then that confronting the past meant not recovering what was lost but recognizing what had never truly existed except in the space between notes. <words>30</words>
Her heartbeat of nothingness was his own, the silence that lived in every song he would ever play. <words>20</words>
As the final star dimmed, the chamber released him, and he walked out carrying only his lute, the embroidered collar left behind like a shed skin. <words>25</words>
The echo chamber testing site remained unchanged, but somewhere in its depths, a new silence waited—one that knew his name and would remember it until the next seventh year called him back. <words>32</words>
