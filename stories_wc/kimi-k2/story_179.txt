The confident watchman, Zev, stood inside the giant beehive’s amber-lit corridor, humming with the echo of yearning that dripped from every wax cell. <words>25</words>
He carried a cracked plastic ruler like a scepter, its jagged edge reminding him of the forcibly gentle way he once measured his little sister’s height before envy grew louder between them. <words>37</words>
Today, during the hive’s scheduled coloring sessions, he would mobilize the drones not with commands but with color, hoping to hush the voice of envy that still buzzed inside his own chest. <words>50</words>
Golden light slanted through hexagonal windows as palettes of pollen-paint were passed along wax ramps, and Zev’s remorse felt jubilant because at last he could offer beauty instead of barricades. <words>64</words>
He knelt beside a newly hatched worker, set the cracked ruler across her wing, and whispered, “Measure your dreams against this, not against your sisters.” <words>77</words>
The worker’s antennae trembled, tasting the echo of yearning in his voice, and she dipped her foreleg into cerulean pigment, tracing a spiral that matched the fingerprint Zev had studied that morning under a microscope. <words>93</words>
Through the patterns in that fingerprint—his sister’s, preserved on a slide—he had seen rivers of regret and ridges of forgiveness, a map that told him gentleness must be deliberate, even forceful. <words>108</words>
So now, with forcibly gentle strokes, he guided the drones to paint every third cell with indigo, every seventh with sunrise orange, creating a rhythm that turned rivalry into harmony. <words>123</words>
Envy hissed like a torn wing, but the colors rose louder, and the hive began to sing in frequencies that tasted like citrus and forgiveness. <words>136</words>
Zev lifted the cracked ruler, tapped it against a wax pillar, and the sound rang out like a bell, mobilizing even the shyest foragers to join the coloring sessions. <words>150</words>
Together they painted murals of shared nectar, of wings interlocked, of larvae dreaming in pastel cocoons, and with each brushstroke the echo of yearning softened into celebration. <words>165</words>
When the final cell blushed with rose, Zev pressed the ruler flat against the comb, its fracture now filled with gold leaf, sealing the memory of what had been broken and remade. <words>180</words>
The hive quieted; the voice of envy, once a roar, was now a distant hum beneath the jubilant remorse that fluttered in Zev’s own heart like a newly emerged bee testing the air. <words>195</words>
He stepped back, microscope slide tucked safely in his pocket, knowing the fingerprint’s spiral would guide tomorrow’s colors, tomorrow’s mercy. <words>208</words>
And as the sun set through the hive’s oculus, the confident watchman smiled, certain that the echo of yearning had finally learned to sing in key. <words>223</words>
