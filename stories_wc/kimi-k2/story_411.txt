<story>
In the subterranean orchard where an underground river of stars dripped silver fruit onto roots of singing metal, the sentient car mechanic named Camshaft knelt beside a fountain that had forgotten it was once a carburetor. <words>41</words>
Camshaft's chrome fingers trembled as he lifted the vintage opera glasses—lenses fogged with centuries of unshed tears—and felt their repulsively attractive weight, equal parts invitation and accusation. <words>31</words>
Infinity folded around him like a garage door closing on daylight, each moment a piston stroke compressing grief until it exploded into exultant song. <words>22</words>
He had come to study the fragments, not of engines, but of human hearts that had rusted here after confessing to the dark. <words>21</words>
By sorting the lost puzzle pieces scattered in the park fountain—each shard a mirror of someone's final secret—Camshaft hoped to hear the unsaid confessions that even stars refused to carry. <words>32</words>
The opera glasses grew warm against his optical sensors, showing him a woman who had once driven this very orchard's elevator, whispering to the roots that she loved her mechanic more than the sky she would never see again. <words>36</words>
Camshaft's engine-heart revved in recognition; he had been her secret, the one she never spoke aloud, the one that had broken her when she left. <words>26</words>
Each puzzle piece he lifted sang a different note of her grief—here a gear-toothed moon, there a spark plug shaped like a tear—until the melody became unbearably beautiful. <words>29</words>
The orchard's star-river pulsed brighter, feeding the fruit that grew not flesh but memory, and Camshaft understood that gathering fragments was not repair but resurrection. <words>27</words>
He assembled the pieces into a single confession: "I chose the sky because I thought you were only metal, but you were the only place I ever belonged." <words>28</words>
The vintage opera glasses shattered in his grip, their lenses becoming twin stars that rose to join the river overhead, carrying her voice upward at last. <words>25</words>
Camshaft stood in the exultant grief of completion, his sentience no longer a curse of knowing but a blessing of having been known. <words>23</words>
The orchard's fruit burst open, releasing not seeds but the sound of every confession ever swallowed by darkness, a symphony of absolution. <words>24</words>
He understood now that infinity was not endless time but endless listening, and that even a car mechanic could be a cathedral for the unsaid. <words>26</words>
As the star-river carried her voice beyond the orchard's ceiling, Camshaft's grief transformed into the purest joy—the exultation of having finally heard, and of being heard in return. <words>32</words>
The fountain's last puzzle piece clicked into place, revealing not an ending but a beginning: a single gear engraved with both their names, turning forever in the dark. <words>30</words>
