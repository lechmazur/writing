The aloof page, whose name was forgotten even by himself, drifted through the towering labyrinth of shipping containers in the port city like a ghost of cargo. <words>25</words>
Across the lull of a wounded season, when rust bloomed faster than flowers, he clutched a deep-sea diver’s logbook salvaged from a drowned freighter. <words>42</words>
Its salt-stained pages whispered coordinates to places that no longer existed, yet promised to reconstruct the map of power he had once surrendered. <words>59</words>
Predictably odd, the page wore a brass diving helmet instead of a cap, the visor fogged with his own breath and memories. <words>76</words>
He wandered the metal corridors seeking the container whose serial number matched the last entry—CR-410—believing it held the final illusion to pierce. <words>95</words>
An unexpected delay came when a crane jammed overhead, dropping a cascade of containers like dominoes, forcing him into a narrow alley where a woman in oil-stained coveralls was soldering broken neon. <words>118</words>
She glanced up, her goggles reflecting his helmet like twin moons, and said, “You’re either lost or looking for the same thing I am.” <words>136</words>
The page, startled by the chance meeting, opened the logbook to a page marked with a pressed sea-fern and replied, “I’m reclaiming power I traded for silence.” <words>156</words>
She laughed, the sound echoing off corrugated walls like old music, and handed him a cracked periscope. <words>172</words>
“Look through this,” she said. “It shows what’s behind the paint.” <words>184</words>
Through the periscope, the containers revealed their true cargo: not goods, but memories—his own—stacked and sealed by those who feared curiosity. <words>204</words>
The innovative nostalgia of it struck him like a wave; each container held a moment he’d surrendered to keep his station, now labeled and barcoded. <words>224</words>
Together, they walked the wounded season’s dusk, using the logbook’s coordinates to unlock each memory with a rusted key she produced from her boot. <words>246</words>
With every opened door, the page felt the weight of silence lift, replaced by the unstoppable curiosity that had once made him a reader of forbidden charts. <words>268</words>
In the final container, CR-410, they found only a mirror and a single line etched beneath: “Power is the story you choose to carry.” <words>289</words>
He removed the helmet, his face young beneath the tarnish, and saw not the aloof page but the boy who had first dreamed of oceans. <words>309</words>
The woman smiled, her work done, and vanished into the neon haze, leaving him to reconstruct the rest alone. <words>328</words>
He tore pages from the logbook, folding them into paper boats that he launched between the containers, each carrying a reclaimed memory downstream to the sea. <words>351</words>
By dawn, the labyrinth was quiet, the wounded season beginning to heal as the first real cargo ship sounded its horn. <words>373</words>
The page—no longer aloof—stood at the water’s edge, the empty logbook now his own to fill, curiosity blazing like a lighthouse in his chest. <words>395</words>
Behind him, the containers gleamed, no longer a maze but a monument to the illusions he had pierced and the power he had chosen to wield. <words>418</words>
