In the shadowed library at dawn, while the city’s lights flicker after an unexpected outage, a crawl space dweller named Lira eased her thin frame between the floor joists beneath the poetry alcove. [38]
She moved with a kindly methodical rhythm, palms gliding over joists she had memorized like braille, counting heartbeats until the next uncertain flicker. [55]
Each tremor of fluorescent relapse cast a sapphire hush across the stacks above, turning spines into rows of dark, unread runes. [70]
Lira’s motivation was simple and fierce: to become visible to those who need her, even if visibility meant only that a single soul would one day speak her name aloud. [90]
Years ago she had discovered that the building’s pipe chases—narrow vertical corridors for steam and forgotten telephone wire—were also arteries of memory. [110]
Voices once recorded on ferromagnetic tape reels had left ghost currents in the copper, and when the power stuttered, those currents bled into the air like scent. [130]
Tonight she hunted a particular fragment she had sensed weeks earlier, a shard of reel no longer than a finger, its oxide skin flaking like rusted petals. [150]
She believed the fragment carried the voice of the night custodian who used to sing lullabies to the closed books, a man who had vanished the same winter Lira first crawled inside. [170]
To cache such a fragment was to preserve the last warm breath of someone who had noticed her when she was still a child sleeping in the returns bin. [190]
She reached a junction where two pipe chases crossed, metal sweating with condensed steam. [205]
With a penlight wrapped in blue cloth to dim its glare, she began uncovering in pipe chases the layers of dust and shredded insulation. [225]
Her fingertips found the edge of the tape, stuck to a copper brace by magnetism and time. [240]
She coaxed it free with the patience of someone untangling a sleeping infant’s hair. [255]
The fragment curled into her palm, lighter than a moth wing yet heavy with sense memory. [270]
When the city’s lights flickered again, the tape vibrated faintly, as if remembering electricity. [285]
Lira pressed it against the bone behind her ear and heard, inside her mind, the custodian humming the alphabet in a lilting, sapphire hush. [305]
Tears blurred the crawl space into cobalt smears; she had not been forgotten after all. [320]
She slid the fragment into a small tin box already lined with three similar shards, each labeled in soft pencil: lullaby, apology, thunderstorm. [340]
This would be lullaby II, and when the box held seven, she would climb out of the walls and place it where a lonely reader might find it. [360]
But first she needed to cache the tin somewhere safe from moisture and mice. [375]
She crawled backward, mapping her retreat by the rhythm of her own breath. [390]
Above her, the library’s emergency lights glowed like captive stars, steady for now but doomed to falter again. [410]
She chose a hollowed beam above the philosophy section, sliding the tin inside and sealing the cavity with a rectangle of felt she had dyed to match the wood grain. [435]
As she worked, the kindly methodical motions calmed the tremor in her wrists. [450]
She whispered to the custodian’s ghost, “I’m still listening,” and felt the tape answer with a faint warmth against her collarbone. [470]
The outage deepened; even the exit signs surrendered, plunging the library into velvet dark. [485]
Yet the sapphire hush persisted, a color she could almost cup in her hands. [500]
Lira lay flat between joists, ear to the floor, and heard footsteps above—someone pacing the poetry aisle, breathing in ragged, uncertain gulps. [520]
A runaway teenager, she guessed, drawn by the same hush that had sheltered her years ago. [535]
She slid the tin’s lid open once more, removed lullaby II, and pressed the fragment against the underside of the floorboard directly beneath the pacing feet. [560]
The tape adhered, magnetism stronger than glue. [570]
She waited, counting heartbeats, until the footsteps paused. [580]
Through a knothole she saw the girl kneel, place her palm on the board, and shiver as the custodian’s voice rose softly through wood and bone: “You are not alone.” [605]
The girl began to cry, soundless, shoulders shaking like pages in a draft. [620]
Lira felt the tears as if they were her own, and in that moment she understood that visibility travels in both directions. [640]
The lights surged back,
