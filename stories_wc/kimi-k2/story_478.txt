<story>
On the orchard island adrift in a swirling maelstrom, the critical midwife Elara walked between rows of wind-bent apple trees, her satchel of pressed herbs rustling like dry wings. <words>31</words>
Under the waxing moon’s glow she moved with dissonant calm, openly secretive about the half-burned diaries she had rescued from the hearth of the birthing cottage. <words>27</words>
Each charred page smelled of smoke and amniotic salt, and she believed the memories stolen from every child she had delivered were hidden between the scorched lines. <words>25</words>
The maelstrom’s roar was a lullaby tonight, masking her footsteps as she climbed the knoll where the oldest tree grew, its roots clutching a stone cradle older than the island itself. <words>29</words>
She laid the diaries in the cradle, sprinkled pressed herbs of rosemary for remembrance and sage for wisdom, and whispered the names of the forty-seven infants whose first cries still echoed in her ears. <words>33</words>
The pages stirred without wind; ink reconstituted itself into sentences that shimmered like moonlit water, revealing the midwife’s own forgotten birth upon this same island. <words>26</words>
She saw her mother’s face—another critical midwife—handing infant Elara to the tree, trading her memories for the island’s safety, a pact sealed every generation. <words>26</words>
Growing wisdom flooded her like warm milk; she understood the orchard fed on recollections, ripening fruit heavy with other people’s childhoods. <words>23</words>
Yet the tree offered a choice: consume the returned memories and remain immortal guardian, or transcend the pact and free every stolen past. <words>24</words>
Elara, openly secretive no longer, lifted the diaries and pressed them against her heart, feeling the maelstrom’s rhythm sync with her pulse. <words>24</words>
She climbed the tree, branch by branch, until the island shrank beneath her like a green coin tossed into black water. <words>22</words>
With deliberate hands she tore the half-burned diaries page by page, scattering ashes and herbs into the vortex, each flake a liberated memory spiraling home. <words>27</words>
The waxing moon dimmed as the maelstrom quieted, the orchard’s apples falling unpicked, sweet with emptiness. <words>19</words>
Elara felt her own memories drain away, yet the growing wisdom remained, a lantern without oil still casting light. <words>21</words>
She stepped off the highest branch and did not fall; instead she floated above the island, her outline dissolving into the dissonant calm of wind and moon. <words>26</words>
Below, the tree cracked open, releasing a chorus of infant cries that rose like larks, each note a life beginning again. <words>23</words>
The orchard island drifted gently now, no longer bound by stolen time, and somewhere in the receding tide a new midwife would soon wash ashore, memory intact, ready to choose differently. <words>34</words>
