The moonlit ridge path wound above the valley like a scar across the mountain’s shoulder, and Mara walked it slowly, boots silent on the frost-silvered gravel. [34]  
She was a scarred forest firefighter, the left side of her face a map of melted skin earned the night she lost three rookies to a crown fire that crowned too fast. [55]  
Tonight she carried a cracked porcelain box no larger than a sparrow’s nest, its glaze crazed into lightning veins that caught and fractured the moonlight. [77]  
Inside lay the last unburned pages of her childhood diary, edges curled like autumn birch, ink faded to the color of old blood. [97]  
She had bargained her innocence long ago—traded it for the promise that if she learned every tongue of flame, she could keep the world from burning. [123]  
The debt still felt unpaid. [128]  
Above her, the slow dance of celestial bodies turned: Jupiter chasing Saturn, Orion pivoting on his belt, all of them indifferent to human grief yet eloquent in their motion. [158]  
Mara stopped where the path narrowed between two wind-sculpted pines and set the box on a flat stone still warm from the day’s sun. [183]  
She knelt, palms open, and began the ritual she had rehearsed since the last ember cooled: to translate pain into a universal language. [215]  
The method was to reflect deeply, not on the fire itself but on the moment before—when the forest had still been singing, when the rookies had laughed at some private joke she could no longer recall. [253]  
She lifted the lid; the porcelain hinge sighed like a sleeping child. [270]  
A single ash moth fluttered out, wings powdered with soot, and settled on her scarred cheek as if recognizing its birthplace. [295]  
Mara did not flinch. [299]  
Instead she spoke aloud the first line she had ever written: “I will keep everything safe.” [320]  
The words tasted of smoke and iron. [327]  
She remembered bargaining with the fire the way children bargain with the dark—If I stay very still, it won’t see me. [354]  
But fire sees everything. [359]  
She closed her eyes and let memory ignite: the roar, the column of orange that ate the stars, the rookie’s glove she found later, fingers curled in a gesture of surprise. [395]  
Pain, she realized, was not a wound but a prism. [408]  
She angled it toward the moonlight, splitting it into colors anyone could read: red for fear, violet for guilt, gold for the stubborn love that had sent her back into the flames. [450]  
Her hands, gently skilled from years of coaxing seedlings into burned soil, now coaxed the colors into the air. [478]  
They rose like auroras, soft ribbons against the hard black sky. [494]  
The moth followed them, circling her head three times before dissolving into sparks that spelled a single word across the ridge: forgive. [525]  
Mara exhaled, and the word drifted down the slope toward the sleeping town where mothers tucked in children who would never know the smell of a crown fire. [560]  
She felt the bargain reverse: innocence was not lost but lent, and tonight she returned it washed clean of blame. [590]  
She closed the cracked porcelain box; the hinge caught the moonlight and refracted it into a thin white line, a seam stitching past to present. [625]  
Rising, she pressed two fingers to her scar, acknowledging it as text rather than shame. [650]  
Then she walked on, the path ahead silvered and forgiving, while behind her the colors lingered, a quiet aurora teaching the night how to hold hard softness without breaking. [700]  
Somewhere below, a child stirred in sleep and dreamed of wings made of light. [720]  
Mara kept walking until the ridge path merged with the valley road, carrying nothing but the memory of translation, the debt now a bridge. [750]  
Above, the planets continued their slow dance, and she lifted a hand in greeting, fluent at last in their ancient, wordless tongue. [775]
