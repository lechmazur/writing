In the root system mapping facility that existed before recorded history, the quiet matchmaker drifted between glowing mycelial chambers, her mariner’s log book clutched like a heart against her chest. <words>31</words>
She was silently talkative; every footstep on the damp earth spoke of tides she had never sailed, every breath carried the salt of lives she had once lived and would live again. <words>42</words>
The cycle of rebirth was not a belief here but a map, each root a meridian, each fungal pulse a compass toward the next incarnation. <words>55</words>
She had come to decode natural patterns, to learn why certain souls kept colliding like swells against the same invisible shore. <words>68</words>
Her motivation was simple and merciless: if she could chart the route of return, she might spare two particular spirits the pain of meeting too soon, loving too hard, and drowning again. <words>85</words>
In the central chamber, an outdated vr headset lay corroded by centuries of spore rain, its wires tangled like kelp around driftwood. <words>99</words>
She opened the mariner’s log book; its pages were blank except for coordinates etched in phosphorescent ink that only appeared when she blinked. <words>113</words>
Tonight she would jeopardize the entire cycle by rewiring the headset, threading those glowing coordinates through copper veins until past and future overlapped like waves at midnight. <words>129</words>
Painful joy surged as she soldered; every spark was a memory of their first kiss in a life when language was still wet clay, every hiss of flux a promise of their last breath on a beach of black sand. <words>147</words>
When the headset flared alive, the root system responded, tendrils lifting her like a tide and plugging straight into her occipital lobe. <words>161</words>
She saw them: two children laughing in a forest that would not exist for another three millennia, their eyes already holding the ache of recognition. <words>176</words>
She rewired faster, rerouting the cycle’s current so their paths would diverge by a single degree, enough to miss collision yet close enough to feel the ache of almost. <words>193</words>
The facility trembled; roots cracked, releasing spores that spelled their names in languages unborn. <words>205</words>
Silently talkative, she whispered through the headset, “Forgive me for the joy of your unlived pain.” <words>218</words>
The mariner’s log book absorbed the tremor, pages filling with a new constellation: a route where love is the lighthouse that warns ships away. <words>233</words>
She collapsed, headset smoking, roots cradling her like a mother who already knows the child will leave again. <words>247</words>
In the hush, she felt the cycle adjust, a subtle shift like the moon tugging one wave back from the rocks. <words>261</words>
Painful joy bloomed: they would live, they would forget, they would meet again, but softer, later, after the sea had learned mercy. <words>276</words>
She closed the log book; its cover now bore a single new coordinate—her own next berth. <words>289</words>
The quiet matchmaker smiled, silently talkative once more, and walked into the dark loam, ready to be reborn with the tide she had just rewritten. <words>306</words>
