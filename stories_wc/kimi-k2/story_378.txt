As the carnival packs up under the first rays of dawn, accidental mayor Gus Trundle—lovably grumpy, badge still pinned to his pajamas—trudges past the polluted swamp orchard tended by reclusive monks, clutching the brass clockwork beetle he won in a rigged ring toss. <words>42</words>
He never meant to become mayor; he only filed to run so the council would fix the pothole outside his bakery, but the other candidates slipped into the swamp and were politely detained by the monks for trespassing. <words>37</words>
Now the beetle’s tiny gears click like scolding tongues, reminding him that the orchard’s once-sweet water apples have turned black with oil slicks, and the monks’ chant drifts over the fetid water: “Listen to the water’s wisdom, or drown in your own noise.” <words>42</words>
Gus snorts, yet the reluctant awe in his chest flutters like moth wings when he overhears a conversation in a crowded cafe—the carnival workers’ last stop before the road—about a “miracle grub” that can devour toxins and metamorphose into luminous beetles, the very species his clockwork toy imitates. <words>45</words>
The barista, paint still flaking from her clown makeup, whispers that the monks guard the grub in a glass jar beneath the altar of St. Amphibian, believing fate itself flows through the swamp’s poisoned veins. <words>34</words>
Gus’s motivation to change the course of fate hardens like caramel; if the grub can cleanse the orchard, the town’s water will heal, and maybe his accidental crown will feel less like a noose. <words>34</words>
He pockets the mechanical beetle, its wings warm from his grip, and barges into the monastery gate just as the monks begin their dawn liturgy of silence. <words>25</words>
They eye his flour-dusted slippers but part when he places the clockwork beetle on the altar beside the grub; the brass wings whir, synchronizing with the grub’s heartbeat until both creatures glow aquamarine. <words>34</words>
Water wisdom surges through the chapel: every drop remembers when the land was pure, every ripple carries the town’s forgotten laughter. <words>23</words>
Gus, still lovably grumpy, feels his cynicism metamorphose into resolve; he lifts the grub, now iridescent, and sets it on the surface of the swamp. <words>26</words>
The carnival trucks rumble away, but their music lingers like a promise as the grub splits into a thousand living beetles that skim the water, drinking poison and exuding light. <words>30</words>
By noon the orchard’s branches gleam with silver fruit, and the monks bow to the accidental mayor who never wanted power yet used it to heal what he never meant to rule. <words>32</words>
Gus watches the clockwork beetle settle on his lapel, its gears now silent, and for the first time he smiles without a grumble, tasting dawn in every clean drop that falls. <words>29</words>
