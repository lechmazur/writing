In the kaleidoscope park, where benches melted into rainbows and trees grew upside-down, the closed-off reaver stalked the paths like a wound that refused to heal. <words>31</words>
His armor, charmingly grotesque, was stitched from the scales of his ancestors' regrets, each scale etched with the same frown he'd worn since birth. <words>25</words>
Children laughed nearby, their voices bright as shattering glass, but he moved through them like smoke, clutching a child's drawing on crumpled paper he'd stolen from a stroller. <words>27</words>
The crayon sun bled orange across the page, and beneath it a stick figure family held hands beneath stars that looked suspiciously like teeth. <words>23</words>
He'd found it tucked inside his mother's journal, the margins filled with scrawled poems that nagged him still: "My son will not become his father, my son will taste the stars in a single kiss." <words>32</words>
The words mocked him with affection, the way his mother had when she'd catch him practicing smiles in the mirror, teaching his face to lie before the first lie was told. <words>27</words>
In the park's heart, a carousel spun backward, its painted horses weeping oil that formed puddles reflecting futures he'd already ruined. <words>21</words>
He sat on a bench that shifted colors beneath him, studying the drawing's generational patterns—the same crooked house, the same too-big sun, the same missing father figure. <words>25</words>
His fingers traced the crayon stars, and he felt the old hunger stir: to taste the stars in a single kiss, to consume light until darkness became impossible. <words>25</words>
But the poems in the margins nagged harder now, their ink bleeding fresh: "Generations of reavers, all starving for the same impossible feast." <words>21</words>
He crumpled the drawing tighter, feeling the paper's pulse like a tiny heart against his palm. <words>17</words>
A child approached—no older than six, with eyes like fresh wounds—and offered him a dandelion gone to seed. <words>19</words>
"Make a wish," the child said, and the reaver almost laughed at the mocking affection in the universe's timing. <words>19</words>
Instead, he pressed the drawing into the child's hand, watching those small fingers smooth the wrinkles with reverence. <words>18</words>
The child studied the picture, then added their own star in the corner—a bright yellow X that broke the pattern entirely. <words>19</words>
In that moment, before any lies could form, the reaver leaned down and kissed the child's forehead, tasting not stars but something sweeter: the possibility of ending. <words>26</words>
The kaleidoscope park shimmered approval, its colors shifting to softer hues as the generational pattern cracked like ice beneath spring. <words>21</words>
He walked away lighter, armor clanking less grotesquely now, leaving the child's drawing fluttering in small hands that might never learn to reave. <words>23</words>
Behind him, the poems in the margins faded to blank spaces, their nagging finally silenced by a single kiss that tasted of ordinary human skin. <words>24</words>
The carousel slowed to stillness, its horses smiling for the first time in centuries, as somewhere a child drew a new picture with the reaver's face among the stars. <words>27</words>
