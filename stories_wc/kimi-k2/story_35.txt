Amid bird calls that sounded like questions, the quiet gardener arrived at the universal translation center, hoping to understand the language of emotions. <words>25</words>
He carried nothing but an embroidered purse that once belonged to his mother, its threads glinting with improbable longing. <words>38</words>
Inside the purse lay a single seed, regularly random in its germination, a gift from the woman whose face he could no longer recall. <words>52</words>
The center’s corridors hummed with silent retreatants, each seeking the same impossible fluency. <words>64</words>
They were led to a glass atrium where memories flicker like candlelight behind frosted panes. <words>76</words>
A facilitator pressed the gardener’s palm to a cool panel, and the seed in his purse pulsed once, as if answering. <words>89</words>
Suddenly the air filled with recovered memories: his mother kneeling in loam, her laughter rising like sap. <words>101</words>
He saw her hands teaching him to tuck seedlings into darkness, promising they would speak when ready. <words>113</words>
The memory dissolved, replaced by the scent of wet earth and the ache of forgetting. <words>124</words>
Around him, other retreatants swayed, their own flickers painting the glass with colorless fire. <words>136</words>
The gardener understood then that the language of emotions was not translated but grown. <words>148</words>
He opened the embroidered purse; the seed had split, revealing a tender root that curled like a question mark. <words>161</words>
Together, in perfect silence, the group carried their sprouting memories to the courtyard. <words>173</words>
They planted them in a circle, each root seeking the others underground. <words>184</words>
Bird calls overhead shifted from interrogation to benediction. <words>194</words>
The gardener pressed soil around his seedling and felt his mother’s absence soften into presence. <words>206</words>
Improbable longing no longer stabbed but watered him from within. <words>216</words>
At dusk, the shared experience ended without a word, yet every retreatant left fluent. <words>228</words>
The gardener lingered, listening to the new leaves rustle in a dialect only the heart could parse. <words>240</words>
He tucked the empty embroidered purse into his pocket, its purpose fulfilled yet heavier with meaning. <words>252</words>
On the train home, he noticed strangers’ faces flicker with the same shy green light. <words>264</words>
He realized the universal translation center had not taught him a language but reminded him he already spoke it. <words>277</words>
Every garden he tended afterward grew not just plants but conversations. <words>288</words>
Tomatoes ripened with apology, lavender hummed forgiveness, and marigolds burned with unspoken joy. <words>301</words>
Neighbors began to leave their windows open, claiming the breeze carried whole novels of consolation. <words>313</words>
Years later, a child would hand him a seed, regularly random, and ask what it would say. <words>326</words>
The quiet gardener would smile, press it into the child’s palm, and reply, “Listen.” <words>338</words>
Together they would kneel amid bird calls, waiting for the flicker of recovered memories to teach them the next syllable. <words>351</words>
And though the longing never vanished, it grew improbably useful, a trellis for every feeling that climbed toward light. <words>365</words>
