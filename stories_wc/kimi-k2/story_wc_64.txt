The blithe cemetery gardener, whose name was Liora, hummed a lullaby to the moon while she clipped the last wilted rose from a marble angel’s hand. [28]  
After the chess clock runs down in the caretaker’s shed, the grounds fall silent except for the hush of wind through yew branches. [42]  
She carries an antique sovereign case in her pocket, its silver warm against her palm like a sleeping heartbeat. [57]  
Tonight she must enter the cobalt silo under stars that look stitched into velveteen gloom. [71]  
Inside, the air smells of rust and lilac, tenderly organized into layers by decades of forgotten breath. [86]  
A tapestry hangs on the curved wall, taller than grief, its border frayed into threads that whisper when touched. [102]  
Liora kneels, lantern low, to untangle the voices knotted there. [112]  
She believes the tapestry records every intention ever buried in the graves she tends, and she has come to discover the shape of intentions that made the ground shiver last winter. [134]  
The antique sovereign case clicks open; inside lies a single tarnished coin and a folded scrap of indigo silk. [152]  
She presses the silk to the tapestry’s edge, and the threads brighten, revealing a map of uncharted echoes—paths of memory not yet walked. [172]  
Following the map, she traces symbols with her thumbnail: a rook, a lily, a question mark. [186]  
Each symbol is a cipher; by decoding frayed threads in the tapestry’s border she translates them into names she recognizes from headstones. [205]  
The first name is her mother’s. [211]  
The second is her own. [216]  
The third is blank, waiting. [220]  
Velveteen gloom thickens as the lantern flickers; the silo seems to inhale. [232]  
She feels the gardener’s spade she left outside tapping against the door, impatient. [247]  
The tapestry trembles, and a low chord, like a cello bowed underwater, rises from the threads. [263]  
Liora understands the chord is an intention shaped like forgiveness, aimed at the blank name. [278]  
She lifts the coin from the sovereign case and sets it into the hollow at the tapestry’s center. [294]  
Metal meets fiber; the border unravels further, but now the threads braid themselves into a small door outlined in starlight. [314]  
Beyond the door she glimpses a garden at dawn, dew on every blade, and her mother kneeling there, young again, planting lilies. [337]  
The image wavers, an uncharted echo refusing to harden into fact. [351]  
Liora’s motivation sharpens: she must decide whether to step through and join that forgiving morning, or stay and finish tending the graves that depend on her blithe constancy. [383]  
She recalls the chess clock: when it runs down, the dead may rise or the living may forget. [401]  
The tenderly organized air rearranges itself into a question: “What do you intend?” [417]  
She smooths the indigo silk over her heart, feeling the weight of every seed she has ever planted. [436]  
The tapestry threads tug gently at her sleeve, not forcing, only inviting. [450]  
Liora closes the sovereign case, trapping the coin’s echo inside. [463]  
She stands, knees creaking like old hinges, and speaks aloud the blank name she now chooses: “Tomorrow.” [483]  
The outlined door softens back into threads, the map dissolving, its purpose served. [498]  
Velveteen gloom lifts a fraction; stars outside the silo shift, rearranging into new constellations that spell out instructions for watering the yews at midnight. [525]  
She rolls the tapestry carefully, tying it with the indigo silk, and carries it out into the night. [545]  
The cobalt silo dims behind her, a quiet sentinel keeping its uncharted echoes for the next seeker. [565]  
Back among the graves, she sets the tapestry beneath the oldest angel, where moonlight can read it. [583]  
She plants a fresh white lily in the disturbed soil, whispering, “I will untangle the rest of you tomorrow.” [605]  
The antique sovereign case, now empty of coin but full of intention, fits perfectly into the hollow of the angel’s palm. [628]  
Liora resumes her humming, the lullaby now threaded with cello chords, and the cemetery breathes easier under the velveteen gloom. [650]  
At the horizon, the first pale hint of dawn appears, tenderly organized like the first move
