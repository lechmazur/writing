The late-shift pier lamplighter, Miren, stepped onto the rotting planks as the sky lantern release began, each paper bloom drifting upward like a slow meteor hush. [31]  
She carried no flame tonight, only the hotel skeleton key tag that once opened room 217 of the Grand Maris, a place now drowned beneath the harbor. [47]  
The tag’s brass teeth had been filed into the shape of a tuning fork, and when the wind struck it, it hummed a color she could almost name. [65]  
Miren’s vow, made to the drowned, was luminous: she would discover the color of sound before the last lantern burned out. [83]  
To signify her intent, she wandered purposefully along the pier, letting the key tag strike every iron lamp, coaxing out notes that shimmered like oil on water. [104]  
Each note painted the air—vermilion, indigo, bruise-purple—yet none matched the chord she had heard the night the ship went down. [123]  
The townsfolk thought her mad, hiding behind truth, claiming she only kept the lamps for safety, but they never followed her to the forgotten library inside the sunken ship. [148]  
Tonight the tide was lowest in years; the library’s broken dome breached the surface like the skull of a leviathan. [168]  
Miren descended the barnacled staircase, lantern light above her replaced by the phosphorescent trails of jellyfish drifting through shattered stained glass. [191]  
Books floated open, their pages turning in slow motion, releasing silted whispers that tasted of copper and lilac. [210]  
She pressed the key tag to a swollen atlas; the paper resonated, bleeding a sound the color of dawn seen through closed eyelids. [231]  
Closer, she thought, but not yet the true hue. [241]  
In the captain’s cabin, a grand piano lay on its side, keys scattered like teeth. [256]  
Miren righted a bench, sat, and dragged the key tag across the remaining wires. [269]  
The note that rose was a silver so bright it left afterimages of ships sailing backward through the sky. [287]  
She closed her eyes, remembering the night the meteor hush fell: the sky lantern release that celebrated the fleet’s departure, the sudden silence when the sea opened and swallowed them. [315]  
Her mother had been aboard, carrying a letter that contained the color of Miren’s first cry. [333]  
The letter was never found, but Miren believed its ink had dissolved into the library’s water, tinting every sound. [353]  
She wandered purposefully between shelves, touching the key tag to spines, listening for the syllable that would complete her vow. [375]  
A book bound in sharkskin vibrated, releasing a low thrum the color of deep trench blue. [393]  
Another, wrapped in kelp, sighed a pale green. [403]  
Still not the chord. [408]  
At the center of the library, a glass case floated intact, inside it a phonograph cylinder labeled “Last Hymn.” [428]  
Miren cracked the case with the key tag, lifted the cylinder, and fitted it into a player warped but functional. [449]  
The stylus dropped. [453]  
Sound unfurled—not through air but through water, through bone—filling the dome with a color that had no name, a hue that existed only in the moment before grief becomes memory. [483]  
Miren gasped; tears blurred the meteor hush above. [495]  
The color of sound was the shade of her mother’s voice saying her name the day she learned to walk. [513]  
The vow was complete. [517]  
She pressed the key tag to her lips, then released it; it sank slowly, twirling, a brass lantern descending instead of rising. [538]  
Above, the last sky lantern flickered out. [548]  
Darkness, then the soft bloom of bioluminescence as the library answered her discovery, shelves glowing in the exact unnamed color. [569]  
Miren rose, no longer hiding behind truth. [580]  
She would tell the town: the drowned were not lost; they sang in every wave, every creak of the pier, every hush between heartbeats. [605]  
She climbed the staircase, water lapping at her ankles, the luminous vow trailing her like a comet’s tail. [626]  
On the pier, dawn bled pale gold. [635]  
Miren lifted her unlit lamp, struck it with the edge of her hand, and the metal rang—the color spilled out, painting the sky in the shade of her mother’s lullaby. [662]  
The townsfolk gathered
