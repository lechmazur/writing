In the greenhouse city of Verdant Spire, where glass domes rose like soap bubbles above the cracked earth, the gilded-leaf calligrapher Lysandra pressed her palm to a wilting vine and felt it shiver away from her half-truth. [38]  
She had told the market boy she was only passing through, when in truth she had come to learn where lost conversations go after the last oasis dried. [50]  
The vine’s leaves browned at the edges, a living barometer of dishonesty, and she whispered an apology that smelled of crushed mint. [63]  
Above the panes, the toxic sky bruised violet, leaking acid rain that hissed against the glass and forced every citizen to speak beneath sheltering fronds. [77]  
Lysandra’s ink was mixed from copper sulfate and hope; each stroke she penned shimmered like beetle shell, yet the words themselves felt hollow since her brother’s last letter dissolved unanswered. [93]  
That night, beneath the teak floorboards of her rented hothouse room, she found a shredded treasure map, edges zinc-etched with postal codes no courier had dared deliver. [108]  
The fragments crackled like dry seedpods, and she recognized the calligraphy—her brother’s, hurried yet elegant, the same hand that once labeled her childhood seedlings. [123]  
She carried the scraps to the communal potting table, spread them beneath a lantern of bioluminescent algae, and began to piece them together, candor in small moments guiding her fingertips. [139]  
Each strip she aligned forced her to reread memories: the argument about leaving, the silence that followed, the final shouted wish to meet “where words are kept alive.” [154]  
The map showed no gold, only a route through abandoned irrigation tunnels toward a rumored archive of spoken things. [166]  
A note on the largest fragment warned, “Truth travels poorly under poisoned skies,” and Lysandra felt the fern beside her droop as she wondered if she had ever truly spoken plainly to the one person who mattered. [183]  
She worked until dawn, sweat fogging the glass, until the map resolved into a spiral leading beneath the city’s oldest mango tree. [196]  
She pocketed a zinc-etched postal plate fragment as proof and stepped outside wearing a respirator woven from moss. [208]  
The streets were rivers of condensation; citizens hurried under umbrella fronds, their voices muffled by masks and fear. [220]  
Lysandra followed the spiral, counting cracked tiles like syllables, until she reached the mango tree whose roots had split the dome floor. [233]  
There she found a hatch corroded green, its handle shaped like a speaking trumpet. [243]  
Inside, the air tasted of wet earth and old paper; phosphorescent fungi lit shelves of glass jars, each containing a swirl of colored vapor labeled with names and dates. [258]  
She located one marked with her brother’s last letter date, unscrewed the lid, and the vapor condensed into his voice: “I’m sorry I left without saying why.” [273]  
The sound was fragile, wilting near her own withheld truths, so she spoke aloud every apology she had rehearsed in silence. [285]  
The vapor brightened, strengthened, and she realized the archive preserved only what was spoken honestly; lies dissipated like steam. [298]  
She reread the map again, this time seeing a second path leading back to her greenhouse, annotated “Return the words to living tongues.” [312]  
Lysandra filled a small vial with her brother’s vapor, sealed it with wax mixed from her gilded ink, and climbed back into the sickly light. [326]  
The mango tree’s leaves rustled, no longer wilting, as if the greenhouse itself exhaled relief. [337]  
She retraced the spiral, but now she spoke to every stranger she met, offering fragments of her story in exchange for theirs. [350]  
Each exchange felt like watering a seed; vines along the path unfurled greener, and the sky’s reflection in the glass seemed fractionally less bruised. [365]  
By the time she reached her rented room, she had collected seven vials of lost conversations, each labeled in shimmering ink. [378]  
She planted the vials beneath the floorboards where the map had been, poured her brother’s vapor onto the soil, and whispered, “Grow.” [392]  
Morning light filtered through the dome, and where the vapor touched earth, tiny shoots of silver-leafed tea plants emerged, leaves etched with remembered voices. [407]  
Lysandra set her pen to a fresh sheet, no longer gilded but plain rice paper, and wrote her brother a letter she would read aloud beneath the mango tree at dusk. [423
