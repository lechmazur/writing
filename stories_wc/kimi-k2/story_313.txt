The unusually normal dawn over the dystopian farm smelled of burnt soy and regret. <words>15</words>
I, a small-time con artist named Lyle, clutched an empty tape dispenser like it still held the power to seal my lies. <words>27</words>
Rows of wilted corn stood in formation, each stalk a soldier that had surrendered to the dust. <words>38</words>
I had come here to taunt the jaws of defeat and grin, but the lull of remorse was louder than any siren. <words>52</words>
A translucent girl flickered between the scarecrows, her eyes the same gray as the pesticide haze. <words>65</words>
She was the first ghost I had to interrogate, and my voice shook with mild fervor. <words>77</words>
"Did you die because of me?" I asked, squeezing the plastic dispenser until it squeaked. <words>90</words>
She nodded, and the motion peeled memory from my skull like old paint. <words>102</words>
I had sold her parents seeds that never sprouted, then vanished with their ration cards. <words>115</words>
The apparition pointed to the dispenser, and I understood: even empty things can bind. <words>128</words>
I walked the furrows, questioning every shimmer—an old man who coughed rust, a boy with pesticide burns shaped like my fingerprints. <words>145</words>
Each answer tightened the lull of remorse into a noose of ordinary sound. <words>157</words>
I tried to comfort them by interrogating harder, as if truth could be tape pulled over their mouths. <words>171</words>
But the ghosts refused silence; they whispered irrigation schedules, weather reports, the exact weight of a child's last breath. <words>187</words>
My grin cracked, yet I kept walking, because defeat has teeth and I had promised to smile into them. <words>201</words>
At the center of the field stood the original scarecrow, burlap face sagging like my conscience. <words>214</words>
Pinned to its chest was a strip of dusty tape—the last piece my dispenser ever held. <words>227</words>
I peeled it free, and the plastic wheel spun with a dry rattle, counting sins instead of inches. <words>241</words>
The ghosts gathered, forming a circle unusually normal in its patience. <words>253</words>
I asked the final question: "What do you want?" <words>262</words>
In one voice they answered, "Use the emptiness." <words>271</words>
I pressed the bare dispenser to the scarecrow's heart, and the tape strip fluttered like a white flag. <words>285</words>
The lull of remorse lifted, not into silence, but into the mild fervor of morning work songs the farm had forgotten. <words>301</words>
The ghosts faded, not forgiven, simply heard. <words>309</words>
I stayed, planting real seeds from the ration I had stolen, the empty dispenser now a spindle for twine. <words>324</words>
Defeat chewed the edges of the field, yet I kept grinning, because every sprout was a small-time con against despair. <words>341</words>
The dystopian sun climbed, unusually normal, and I whispered to the corn, "Grow loud enough to drown the sirens." <words>357</words>
The scarecrow nodded, tape strip flapping like a promise that even empty hands can hold a harvest. <words>372</words>
