At the hush just before a condemned building is demolished, the solitary summoner prowled the quantum beach where probability waves lapped against rusted girders like corroded rapture made liquid. <words>31</words>
In her palm she carried a map drawn on a leaf, its veins forming coastlines that shifted whenever she blinked, an oddly authentic artifact from the holiday her family celebrated by burning every invention they had failed to complete during the year. <words>46</words>
Tonight was that holiday, and the leaf-map was the last thing her grandmother had invented before the forgetting took her, a spark of invention encoded in chlorophyll and regret. <words>31</words>
The summoner had come here not to mourn but to outshine her own reflection, which had grown smug in mirrors lately, whispering that she would never surpass her grandmother's genius. <words>32</words>
She pressed the leaf against the quantum sand where Schr√∂dinger's tides erased and rewrote the shoreline every heartbeat, and began to chant the equation her family used instead of grace before their burning feast. <words>36</words>
The building above her groaned, its demolition charges counting down like mechanical heartbeats, while below, her reflection emerged from the probability foam wearing her grandmother's face twisted into a sneer. <words>32</words>
"You think burning my failures makes them sacred?" the reflection mocked, holding up phantom inventions that flickered between brilliant and broken. <words>23</words>
The summoner smiled, understanding at last the true ritual: not destruction but transformation, and she fed the leaf-map into the quantum foam where it dissolved into pure potential. <words>31</words>
The building exploded overhead in a shower of sparks that rained down like the festival's traditional burning, each ember carrying a fragment of every failed invention her family had ever made. <words>34</words>
Instead of falling, the sparks spiraled upward, reassembling into new configurations that had never existed before, and her reflection stared in wonder as its sneer melted into genuine joy. <words>32</words>
She had outshone herself not by defeating her reflection but by teaching it to invent alongside her, turning corroded rapture into creation's pure fire. <words>27</words>
The quantum beach settled into a new shoreline that matched the leaf-map's final configuration, and she walked home carrying nothing but the memory of how her grandmother's failures had become her own spark of invention. <words>38</words>
At dawn, her family would find the demolition site transformed into a garden of impossible machines growing from the ashes, each one a collaboration between past and future selves. <words>32</words>
She was no longer solitary, for her reflection walked beside her now, and together they would celebrate next year's holiday by planting instead of burning, letting every spark take root. <words>35</words>
