In the treehouse city of Boa Vista do Rio Verde, where vines gossip louder than parrots, proud exorcist Lúcia Batista balanced on a rope bridge and felt the clock dare to skip a beat. <words>34</words>
The sudden closure of the usual path—an entire walkway snapped by last night's storm—forced her to detour past the library loft where the wizard’s battered grimoire waited like a smug toad. <words>30</words>
She hated that book; it had once belonged to her mentor, the looming shadow himself, Professor Aldo, whose ghost still lectured her from every leaf. <words>25</words>
Lúcia’s endearingly feisty macaw familiar, Juju, squawked, “If you outshine him, buy me mango wine,” and pecked the grimoire’s spine so dust motes danced like guilty spirits. <words>29</words>
The weight of responsibility pressed heavier than humidity: every poltergeist she banished kept the city’s children safe, yet each success only proved Aldo right—that she was merely his echo. <words>31</words>
Playful cynicism curled her lip; she whispered to the book, “Let’s see who echoes whom,” and opened it to a page labeled Youthify: A Reversal of Years, Not Wisdom. <words>28</words>
The spell required a drop of pride, a pinch of fear, and the willingness to trade future wrinkles for present wonder; she supplied all three, plus a curse word Juju learned too quickly. <words>31</words>
Lightning without storm flared; her reflection in a puddle showed her twelve years old, freckled, furious, and still wearing oversized exorcist robes like a tent. <words>27</words>
Juju laughed so hard he fell off the railing, catching himself with a casual wingflip. <words>16</words>
Miniature Lúcia stomped toward the snapped bridge, the grimoire now heavier than her entire body, and realized the spell had also youthified her authority; the planks refused to recognize her. <words>32</words>
Aldo’s shadow lengthened across the canopy, chuckling, “Run home, little echo.” <words>13</words>
She felt the city’s heartbeat stutter; poltergeists sensed the exorcist’s weakness and began unscrewing bolts from the treehouses like malicious dentists. <words>25</words>
Responsibility, she learned, isn’t measured in height but in the refusal to surrender it; she dragged the grimoire to the city’s central drum-root, pounded out a rhythm of apology, and offered the spell back. <words>36</words>
The book accepted, drinking her pride like bitter coffee; years snapped back into her bones, the bridge reknitted itself, and Aldo’s shadow shrank to the size of a doubt. <words>30</words>
At dusk, Lúcia lounged on the restored walkway, teaching Juju to say, “The shadow’s mine now,” while mango wine chilled in the rain barrel below. <words>29</words>
When the clock dared to skip again, she only smiled, because this time the beat belonged to her. <words>22</words>
