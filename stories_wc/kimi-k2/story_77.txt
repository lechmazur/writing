The last page of the forgotten journal fluttered in the recycled air of the asteroid hideout, its ink drowsy with enthusiasm as it described the empath's arrival. <words>28</words>
Kael, an introverted empath who felt every heartbeat like a bruise, stepped through the obviously hidden hatch behind a crate of plasma rifles. <words>20</words>
In his pocket, a dried starfish—gift from a dying mer-colony—crumbled slightly, its five arms reminding him of the five outcasts huddled in the cargo bay below. <words>25</words>
The space pirates had abandoned them here, branding them "mad for believing in mountain wisdom among stars." <words>15</words>
Kael knelt, spreading the journal's final paragraph like a map: "When the mind shatters, reassemble it like a marionette; the strings are truths the world refused." <words>24</words>
He opened the tin box the pirates had mocked—a shattered marionette lay in splinters, its wooden limbs painted with constellations no chart recognized. <words>22</words>
Each fragment hummed with memory: the astronomer who charted impossible peaks, the cartographer who drew valleys that breathed, the three others who'd seen mountains move through vacuum. <words>27</words>
Kael's gift surged; he felt their exiled wonder as a pressure behind his eyes, drowsy yet burning. <words>16</words>
With thread spun from his own hair—an empath's vow—he began to marshal the fragments, knotting each joint while whispering coordinates the pirates never taught. <words>25</words>
The dried starfish's dust coated the marionette's heart, a salt blessing from an ocean world that had also been declared unreasonable. <words>21</words>
As the final limb clicked into place, the puppet stood, its painted eyes reflecting asteroid rock that suddenly looked like cliff faces. <words>20</words>
The outcasts stirred; the astronomer laughed, recognizing the slope of a shoulder as the ridge she'd once climbed in dreams. <words>19</words>
Mountain wisdom, Kael realized, wasn't about stone—it was about refusing to let the world flatten your peaks. <words>18</words>
The marionette lifted its wooden hand, pointing toward the obviously hidden launch panel the pirates had forgotten. <words>17</words>
Together, the six of them—the empath, the starfish's ghost, and the four believers—boarded the patched shuttle, its hull scrawled with new constellations shaped like ranges. <words>25</words>
Behind them, the journal's closing page drifted to the floor, its last line now complete: "They left to champion the outcasts of reason, carrying mountains in their chests where engines should be." <words>29</words>
The asteroid shrank behind them, just another fragment waiting to be reassembled into something braver. <words>16</words>
Kael pressed the dried starfish's remaining arm to the viewport; outside, nebulae rose like impossible summits, and the drowsy enthusiasm in his heart sharpened into a climber's resolve. <words>27</words>
