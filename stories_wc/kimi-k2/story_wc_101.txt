The ridge above the valley had once been a vineyard, but the sanctions had stripped the vines and left only the terra-cotta arbor, its tiles cracked like old pottery. [34]
Every night at eleven-thirty, Lila, the exile community leader, slipped out of the dormitory carrying a canvas bag and an antique silver bell no larger than a walnut. [50]
The bell had crossed three borders with her, sewn into the hem of her coat, its tongue wrapped in cloth so it would not betray her to soldiers. [66]
Now she unwrapped it and let it ring once, a sound so soft it was almost the memory of sound, amplified quiet that carried farther than shouting ever could. [83]
The signal meant the midnight food run had begun. [90]
During the sanctions period, the government trucks came only once a week, and what they brought was measured by hunger, not hope. [105]
Lila’s people—teachers, engineers, grandmothers who had once owned bookshops—survived on anonymous donations that appeared in unmarked crates beside the arbor. [123]
No one claimed credit, and no one asked, because asking might make the gifts stop. [134]
Lila’s role was to keep the fragile circuit alive, gently persistent, like water shaping stone. [146]
She moved along the ridge paths, the bell chiming every hundred steps, a lullaby for the wary. [158]
At each house she left rice, oil, a single pomegranate wrapped in newspaper, and sometimes a folded note that read simply, “For the children.” [175]
The children were the reason she had been elected leader in the first place; exile had no constitution, only the unspoken rule that whoever could imagine tomorrow should guide tonight. [193]
Tonight the air smelled of wet clay and woodsmoke, and the moon hung low enough to snag on the arbor’s broken trellis. [208]
Lila paused there, touching the bell to her lips as if kissing a relic. [218]
Behind her, footsteps crunched on gravel. [224]
Old Tomasz emerged from the shadows, his coat patched with sailcloth. [234]
He had once conducted orchestras; now he carried a thermos of broth and a question. [245]
“How long can we keep this up?” he whispered. [252]
Lila did not answer at once. [257]
Instead she rang the bell twice, the signal for all-clear, and the sound folded itself into the night like a secret handshake. [271]
“Long enough,” she said finally. [277]
“Long enough for what?” [281]
“To declare that we are still a people.” [288]
The word tasted like iron and honey. [294]
She explained while they walked: every jar of lentils, every whispered recipe passed from grandmother to granddaughter, was a vote cast in the dark. [310]
The donations were anonymous, but the nourishment was not; it carried names inside it, histories braided into bread. [323]
Tomasz nodded, understanding that the midnight food runs were more than charity—they were curriculum, apprenticeship, inheritance. [337]
They reached the last house, where a girl named Soraya waited with her baby brother on her hip. [350]
Lila handed over a packet of saffron, worth more than gold during sanctions, and Soraya’s eyes widened. [363]
“My mother used this in her wedding rice,” the girl said. [372]
“Then teach him the scent,” Lila replied, touching the baby’s forehead with a flour-dusted finger. [384]
On the walk back, the bell silent now, Lila felt the ridge itself breathing beneath her feet. [396]
She thought of the donors—shopkeepers in the capital who left crates at crossroads, farmers who lowered buckets into ravines—people she would never meet but who trusted her to keep the chain unbroken. [418]
Trust was the real cargo, heavier than rice, lighter than air. [429]
At the arbor she found a new crate, smaller than usual, its lid painted with a single star. [441]
Inside lay seed packets and a note: “For the season after.” [451]
Lila pressed the paper to her heart, then rang the bell three times, the signal for gathering. [464]
One by one, the exiles emerged, shawls over their shoulders, children rubbing sleep from their eyes. [477]
They formed a circle under the terra-cotta tiles, the moonlight glazing their faces the color of fired clay. [491]
Lila lifted the antique silver bell and let it sing alone, a note so pure it seemed to stop time. [505]
When the echo faded, she spoke. [511]
“We are here to declare that tomorrow is already planted.” [521]
She held up the seed packets. [526]
“These are not gifts; they are
