The irate smuggler pounded across the abandoned spaceport flight deck, boots cracking frost as he jogged, breath carving white scars into the vacuum-cold dawn. <words>25</words>
He clenched the single chopstick he’d stolen from the last meal he’d shared with his sister before she vanished into the black, its lacquered surface now warped by years of sweat and rage. <words>42</words>
Every stride was a heartbeat’s revolt against the silence that had swallowed her ship, against the contracts that had paid him to look away, against the hollow promise of hidden waterfalls rumored to pulse beneath the tarmac. <words>63</words>
The deck stretched like a frozen tongue, metal plates buckled into abstractly physical ridges that mirrored the scar tissue across his chest—geography of guilt he could feel with every impact. <words>85</words>
He ran harder, as if speed could outrun memory, yet memory kept pace, whispering coordinates he’d memorized from her final, unsent message: waterfalls under Bay 19, where runoff once carved secret rivers beneath the stars. <words>110</words>
At the center of the bay he stopped, chest heaving, and knelt beside a cracked ceramic mug some long-gone mechanic had left behind, its inside stained with rings of ancient tea. <words>134</words>
With biting sincerity he pressed the chopstick into the dust, stirring the residue into slow spirals, forcing the leaves to memorialize her absence through patterns only grief could read. <words>158</words>
A dragon coalesced, then fractured into two wings—one ascending, one burning—telling him she had flown and fallen in the same breath. <words>178</words>
The revolt in his heart surged, no longer abstract but a physical fist punching against his ribs, demanding he believe the impossible: that water still moved under this graveyard of steel. <words>203</words>
He scraped harder, revealing a hairline seam in the deck; the chopstick wedged, levered, and a slab shifted with a hiss of released pressure. <words>225</words>
Cool mist breathed upward, carrying the scent of wet stone and living moss, the perfume of waterfalls long buried. <words>246</words>
He descended the rusted ladder, jogging now down a service corridor where condensation dripped like metronomes, each drop counting the seconds since he’d last heard her laugh. <words>272</words>
At the corridor’s end, the tunnel opened into a cavern where moonlight, fractured through cracked hull plating, silvered a cascade plunging into a pool so clear it mirrored his face and hers, superimposed. <words>301</words>
He stepped into the water, boots filling, heart slowing, the revolt quieting into acceptance; the chopstick he planted upright in the silt like a marker, a single spire to memorialize the sister who had believed in hidden miracles. <words>335</words>
Above, the flight deck remained abandoned, but below, the waterfalls sang, and he listened, jogging in place within the pool, letting the current scour the smuggler from his skin until only the brother remained. <words>368</words>
When he finally climbed back, dawn had turned the deck gold; he left the chopstick standing in the cavern, a promise that every run would end here, where revolt became remembrance, and absence became motion. <words>410</words>
