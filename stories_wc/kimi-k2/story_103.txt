<story>
The weatherbeaten knight stared at his own reflection in the lighthouse prison's cracked mirror, knowing this moment existed only within the mirrored reflection of time itself. <words>25</words>
His gauntleted hand trembled as he lifted the brass door knocker from the warden's abandoned desk, its weight both familiar and foreign in his calloused palm. <words>20</words>
Through the barred window, waves crashed against the jagged reef below, each impact echoing the impossible choices that had brought him to this forsaken place. <words>19</words>
He spread the seemingly random items across the stone floor: a child's wooden horse, a bloodstained ribbon, a single white feather, and the brass door knocker forming the final piece of their terrible pattern. <words>25</words>
These four objects had appeared throughout his campaigns, each one marking a village burned, a family destroyed, an innocence lost to his blade. <words>18</words>
The pattern revealed itself now in this lighthouse prison where he served as both captive and keeper, each item representing a life he could have saved if he'd chosen mercy over duty. <words>23</words>
His weatherbeaten face cracked into a grudgingly sweet smile as he finally understood the lighthouse's cruel purpose—it amplified every regret until the final cry became unbearable. <words>21</words>
The brass door knocker grew warm in his hand, and he knew it would open only one door: the one that led backward through every choice he'd made. <words>19</words>
To hush the final cry of regret that echoed through these mirrored halls, he would need to appreciate each death he'd caused, truly understand their weight beyond mere numbers. <words>22</words>
He arranged the items in a perfect square, the brass door knocker at the center, and watched as the mirror's surface rippled like disturbed water. <words>19</words>
Through the reflection, he saw himself at each moment of choice—the child's horse crushed beneath his horse's hooves, the ribbon's owner reaching for her mother's hand, the feather falling from a slain messenger's cap. <words>27</words>
The joyful agony of recognition flooded him as he stepped through the mirror, feeling every death simultaneously as both victim and killer. <words>17</words>
In this impossible space between reflection and reality, he knelt before each memory, the brass door knocker now burning like a brand against his chest. <words>19</words>
He whispered apologies to the wooden horse, tied the ribbon around his own wrist, placed the feather over his heart, and finally used the knocker three times against the mirror's surface. <words>25</words>
The lighthouse prison dissolved around him, but instead of release, he found himself standing at the edge of the jagged reef, forever caught between the joyful agony of redemption and the eternal weight of his choices. <words>28</words>
The final cry of regret became his own voice, eternally hushed yet eternally screaming, as he became the lighthouse keeper who warns others away from the rocks he'd chosen to crash upon. <words>27</words>
