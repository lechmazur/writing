The soothsayer staggered through the maze of billboards, neon slogans screaming BUY NOW, DIE LATER across the desert night, mildly panicked because the years between lost years had finally caught up. <words>31</words>
In her shaking palm rested a pocket puzzle box with 13 locks, each click a reminder that destiny wasn't shaped by prophecy but by bare, blistered hands. <words>25</words>
She'd stolen it from the last oasis before the corporations pumped it dry, a probably unlikely act for someone who once charged tourists twenty credits per fortune. <words>24</words>
Now she read the water rings on a battered wooden bar top—salvaged from a burned-down saloon—because water was memory and memory was rebellion. <words>22</words>
The rings told her the aquifer beneath this neon graveyard still breathed, a slow pulse magnified by every careless spill of synthetic whiskey. <words>21</words>
She knelt, pressing her ear to the wood like a lover, hearing the desert's sarcastic whisper: "You want to save me? Start by admitting you helped kill me." <words>27</words>
The first lock on the box clicked open—she'd solved it by counting the ripples left by a melting ice cube, each circle a year of drought. <words>23</words>
Billboard lights flickered, projecting ads for bottled air over her head, their glow turning her sweat into liquid gold. <words>19</words>
Second lock: she traced a ring shaped like a dying river, whispering apologies to fish she'd never met. <words>17</words>
The box grew warmer, as if the desert itself was breathing through its brass hinges. <words>14</words>
Third lock: a child's spilled soda drew rings that looked like chains—she'd sold their future for cheap trinkets, hadn't she? <words>21</words>
Molten sarcasm dripped from her tongue: "Environmental stewardship, brought to you by the same species that invented plastic cacti." <words>18</words>
Fourth lock: the wood showed her own reflection, distorted by water stains, and she laughed—destiny shaped by hands that once signed drilling permits. <words>22</words>
The billboards began to dim, their power draining into the box as if it were a battery for regret. <words>17</words>
Fifth lock: a ring that looked like a seed, reminding her that even now, something green waited beneath the sand. <words>19</words>
She stood, box clicking faster now, locks surrendering to the water's testimony. <words>13</words>
The neon maze flickered once more, then died, leaving only starlight and the sound of distant thunder. <words>15</words>
Thirteenth lock: the box opened to reveal a single drop of water, magnified by moonlight into a universe. <words>17</words>
She held it up, watching it reflect every billboard, every lie, every lost year. <words>14</words>
Then she poured it onto the sand, where it vanished—but beneath her feet, something stirred. <words>15</words>
The soothsayer smiled, mildly panicked no longer, her bare hands finally shaping destiny instead of selling it. <words>16</words>
Above her, the first real cactus in decades began to bloom. <words>11</words>
