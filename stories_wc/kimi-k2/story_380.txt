In the forgotten library inside a treehouse, where dust motes drifted like the last human memories, the convicted dream thief leafed through a flimsy photo album whose plastic sleeves crackled like distant thunder. <words>34</words>
Each faded picture showed the same child—himself—holding a crooked baseball bat, the sport that once stitched whole cities together now reduced to these brittle fragments. <words>27</words>
He was mathematically challenged, unable to tally the stolen dreams he had bartered for extra innings, yet the numbers haunted the margins of every page in smudged zeros. <words>26</words>
After the last human was born—an event marked by silence rather than cries—the treehouse library had become the final archive of selves that no longer multiplied. <words>26</words>
Quiet mania fluttered in his chest like a trapped moth as he realized the album was not a record but a jigsaw of the fragmented self he had scattered across sleeping minds. <words>28</words>
He pressed a trembling finger to a Polaroid where his seven-year-old grin was split by a missing tooth, and felt the corresponding ache in a memory he had never lived. <words>27</words>
The sentence for dream theft was dissolution: to become the very emptiness one had inflicted, yet he clung to baseball as both crime and salvation. <words>24</words>
If he could coax thunder from empty skies, perhaps the crack of a phantom bat would reunite the shards, restoring the whole boy who had vanished into statistics he could not add. <words>31</words>
He arranged the photos in batting order, assigning each fragment an inning, a position, a chance to score back the stolen outs of identity. <words>25</words>
The treehouse creaked, wind moving through hollowed trunk like a coach calling him home, and he heard the faint cheer of a crowd that existed only in confiscated dreams. <words>29</words>
With a breath that tasted of pine resin and regret, he stepped onto the library’s narrow balcony, album clutched like a lineup card against his racing heart. <words>25</words>
Below, the forest floor waited like a dark catcher’s mitt; above, the sky was a scoreboard wiped clean. <words>19</words>
He whispered the rules of the game he and every stolen self once loved: three strikes, four balls, nine innings to become whole. <words>23</words>
Then he let the album fall. <words>5</words>
Pages scattered, photos spiraling, and as they descended he followed, choosing to plunge rather than dissolve, to slide headfirst into the final base where all fragments might collide. <words>30</words>
Mid-air, the quiet mania peaked into a roar; the sky cracked—not thunder, but the sharp, clean sound of a wooden bat meeting a dream he had once stolen from himself. <words>29</words>
Impact came like applause, leaves exploding upward in a standing ovation, and for one impossible moment the scattered photos aligned into a single, unbroken image of a boy who knew how to count to one. <words>34</words>
In the hush that followed, the forgotten library inside the treehouse sighed, shelves resettling like old bones, and somewhere a new dream began to form—not stolen, but shared, stitched from nine innings and the echo of a game that refused to end. <words>39</words>
