The underachieving mage, Elian, stood at the edge of the icebound spire above the clouds, where the air itself seemed to shimmer with a brilliant dimness that made his eyes ache. [34]  
He had come here when creativity got automated, when spells were mass-produced by clockwork scribes and every apprentice could conjure fire with a snap. [50]  
Elian, who had once dreamed of shaping stars, now carried only a garden folly keystone in his pocket—a chipped marble wedge no larger than his thumb, salvaged from a demolished pleasure dome. [70]  
The keystone was said to accommodate impossibilities, a boast carved into its pocked surface by some long-dead architect who believed arches could hold up dreams. [90]  
Tonight, under the lingering luminance of a moon that refused to set, Elian intended to test that boast. [105]  
He knelt, palms against the spire’s glassy flank, and began to unstrap the iron crampons that had kept him from sliding into the abyss. [123]  
Bare feet on ice: the first impossibility he offered the keystone. [134]  
Cold shot through him like forgotten music, yet the stone warmed, drinking the sensation. [148]  
Elian closed his eyes and stepped forward, trusting the method his grandmother had whispered—mist walking, the art of believing the vapor beneath you is solid enough to bear regret. [170]  
Fog rose from the spire’s wounds, coiling around his ankles, then his knees, until he stood on nothing, upheld by doubt made visible. [188]  
Each pace left a faint afterimage, a lingering luminance that clung to the air like memory refusing to fade. [203]  
He walked until the spire vanished and only the keystone’s weight reminded him he still possessed a body. [218]  
Shapes drifted past: a fountain frozen mid-spill, a sundial telling time backwards, a rosebush blooming in negative. [235]  
All fragments of the garden the keystone once crowned, now exiled into this high, thin place where rules were negotiable. [252]  
Elian understood then that the sacred in the simple was not a discovery but a surrender. [267]  
He stopped walking and opened his hand. [273]  
The keystone floated free, turning slowly, its cracks glowing with the same soft light that haloed his footprints. [289]  
From each fracture spilled a scent of wet earth after rain, the sound of a child laughing at shadows, the warmth of bread pulled from an oven at dawn. [310]  
The impossibilities it had accommodated were returning home, no longer needed. [323]  
Elian felt his own failures—missed exams, spells that fizzled, the disappointed sighs of mentors—rise from his chest like startled birds. [343]  
They circled the keystone once, then dissolved into the mist, leaving him lighter than the air he stood on. [359]  
The brilliant dimness deepened, neither night nor day, a hush that made every heartbeat sound like a cathedral bell. [375]  
He realized the spire had never been a destination but a question: what do you carry that you no longer need? [393]  
The keystone answered by shrinking, condensing its gathered light into a single drop that hung between them. [408]  
Elian caught it on his fingertip; it tasted of salt and snow. [418]  
At that touch, the mist solidified into a narrow bridge of clear ice leading nowhere visible. [432]  
He stepped onto it, and the bridge began to descend, carrying him through layers of cloud that smelled of graphite and lilacs. [450]  
Far below, the automated world sparkled with factory-perfect auroras, efficient and soulless. [465]  
Elian felt no contempt, only pity, for they had not yet learned to unstrap themselves. [478]  
The bridge ended at the threshold of a kitchen garden behind the academy he had fled. [492]  
Tomatoes glowed like small suns, and a scarecrow wore his old apprentice robe. [505]  
He pressed the luminous drop into the soil; it sank without resistance. [517]  
Morning came instantly, though no sun rose; the lingering luminance simply decided it was time. [532]  
Elian knelt, palms dirty, heart quiet. [540]  
The garden folly keystone lay beside a trowel, now nothing more than stone. [552]  
He left it there, a monument to the moment he stopped trying to be extraordinary and let the ordinary save him. [571]  
Behind him, the icebound spire above the clouds dissolved into mist, its purpose fulfilled. [587]  
Elian walked back toward the academy, not to
