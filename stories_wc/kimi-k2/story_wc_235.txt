The lucid dream chronicler stood in the mountain ranger cabin, birch bark scroll clenched in her frost-numbed fingers, staring at the photograph of her own gravestone dated three years from now. [34]
Outside, wind scraped pine needles across the tin roof like a warning. [42]
She had come here to distill chaos into narrative, but the grave had made her chronologically confused, every memory bleeding forward and backward until yesterday tasted like childhood and tomorrow ached like arthritis. [64]
On the scroll she had inked every dream she ever controlled, yet the newest entry—written in sleep last night—showed her signature already weathered by decades. [83]
Feral nostalgia clawed at her ribs, a wild animal furious that any past self had once felt more alive than she did now. [97]
She pressed the bark to her lips, tasting tannin and snow, and felt the cabin tilt as though the mountain itself were impatient. [113]
In the cracked mirror above the woodstove she caught sight of her twenty-five-year-old face superimposed on her sixty-year-old skull, both versions blinking back at once. [137]
The younger face mouthed, "You wasted the wings," and the older one replied, "You never learned to fall." [155]
Jealousy flared, hot and ridiculous; she resented the girl who still believed flight required only will, and the crone who had forgotten the weight of wonder. [178]
She unrolled the birch bark further, past sketches of cities that never existed, until she reached the margin where ink dissolved into raw wood: the place she always stopped, afraid the next line would finish her. [211]
Tonight the scroll resisted, fibers tightening like muscle, forcing her thumb to bleed. [226]
Blood touched bark, and the cabin floorboards softened into cloud. [235]
She did not resist; she stepped off the planks and began to soar through the rafters, past moth wings and smoke ghosts, up into the cold lung of the night. [258]
Below, the ranger cabin shrank to a matchbox, its single yellow window an eye that winked shut. [275]
Air tasted of iron and pine sap, and every star hummed with a name she had once given it in a dream she later denied. [296]
She flew higher, chasing the chronology that scattered like spilled mercury. [308]
At the crest of the thermals she saw them: every version of herself standing on separate peaks, each clutching a different scrap of the same birch scroll. [333]
The youngest was laughing, ink on her cheeks like war paint. [345]
The middle one wept, scroll blank, having traded words for mortgage payments. [359]
The eldest simply held out her fragment, edges charred, and said, "We are the story you refuse to finish." [381]
The chronicler felt the jaded wonder she had nursed for years—wonder that anything still surprised her, jaded because surprise hurt. [404]
She wanted to land, to gather the scattered selves into one coherent body, but the act of soaring demanded distance. [424]
Instead she shouted across the wind, "Tell me the ending so I can write it down!" [442]
The eldest smiled with teeth like cracked ice. [450]
"There is no ending, only the moment you stop being jealous of who you were and let the bark burn." [472]
The scroll in her hands caught fire, flame blue as glacier milk. [485]
Ash spiraled upward, each flake a word she had hoarded. [497]
The heat did not consume her skin; it consumed the timeline, peeling years away like bark from a birch. [515]
She felt herself shrink and stretch simultaneously, ages collapsing into a single inhale. [530]
When the last ember winked out, she stood barefoot on the cabin threshold again, the mountain ranger cabin exactly as it had been an hour or a lifetime ago. [560]
The birch bark scroll was gone, but her palms smelled of smoke and sap. [575]
On the table lay a fresh sheet of bark, unmarked. [585]
She sat, dipped her bleeding thumb in the ash of her jealousy, and began to write—not to chronicle dreams, but to admit that chaos had always been the truest narrative. [625]
Outside, dawn bled lavender across the peaks, and somewhere a gravestone waited, patient and irrelevant. [648]
She wrote until the sun cleared the ridge, and when she finally looked up, her reflection in the window showed only one face, ageless and unafraid. [680]
The cabin sighed, timbers settling like an old dog. [690]
She rolled the new scroll, tied it with a strand of her own silvering hair, and placed it on the shelf beside the empty tin that once held tea and now held all the years she
