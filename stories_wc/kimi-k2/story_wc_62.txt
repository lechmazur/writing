The ancient greenhouse at dusk smelled of wet loam and bruised citrus, and the thoughtful gravestone carver, Mara, stepped inside as the first monarchs of the butterfly migration brushed her cheeks like warm ash. [34]  
She carried a woven ribbon roll the color of river silt, its threads frayed from decades of being unspooled and respooled during the family custom of trading favorite poems at dinner. [52]  
Tonight she would retrace the route her mother had walked each equinox, reading aloud to the glass-roofed aisles of forgotten camellias, because the shape of collective grief had begun to feel like a stone she could not lift alone. [78]  
Mara set the ribbon on the potting bench, its spool clicking softly, and waited for the mentor her mother had promised would come when the greenhouse thundered with calm. [96]  
The air thickened; wings beat overhead like distant drums, and a shimmer coalesced beside the night-blooming datura—her mother’s outline, translucent yet fiercely meditative, eyes closed as if listening to a heartbeat only the dead can hear. [125]  
“Begin,” the spectral voice said, “with the poem you refused to trade last year.” [137]  
Mara’s throat tightened; she unrolled the ribbon until she found the ink-faded stanza her mother had written the day the last gravestone order arrived from the village—an epitaph for children lost in a fire. [167]  
She read, voice steady as winter iron: “We carve not names but the space between them, so the wind can pass through and carry the living forward.” [195]  
The greenhouse answered with a low, thundering calm, glass panes vibrating until pollen drifted like pale snow, and the butterflies formed a slow vortex above the spectral mentor, their wings spelling silent letters. [226]  
Mara understood the lesson: grief is not a monument but a migration, always arriving and always leaving. [247]  
Yet she needed more; she asked the shade how to shape that motion into stone so the village might recognize its own sorrow and release it. [272]  
The mentor extended a hand of pale light and touched the ribbon; the fibers glowed, rearranging themselves into a map of flight paths the butterflies had followed for centuries. [301]  
“Retrace these lines,” the specter instructed, “with chisel and mallet, not to fix the path but to honor its passing.” [323]  
Mara spent the next weeks in the greenhouse at dusk, each evening unspooling the ribbon further, reading new poems traded at hurried dinners with her father, who now spoke only in haiku, and her brother, who recited Neruda as if the words were bread. [366]  
With every reading, the spectral mentor grew clearer, edges sharpening like frost on iron, and Mara’s chisel followed the glowing map across blank granite, carving shallow grooves that caught rain and reflected sky. [401]  
The butterflies arrived in waves, monarchs first, then swallowtails, then the small blue ghosts no one in the village had ever named; they landed on the stone, drank from the grooves, and lifted off again, carrying flecks of mica like memories. [449]  
One evening, the mentor’s voice softened: “The shape you seek is not in the stone but in the space where the butterflies rise.” [476]  
Mara set down her tools and stepped back; the greenhouse was empty of wings, the migration complete, and the gravestone stood alone, its surface etched with a single flowing line that resembled both a river and a wing. [520]  
She rolled the ribbon tight, tying it with the last poem her mother had traded: “Grief is the echo of love learning to fly.” [545]  
The spectral mentor smiled, form dissolving into pollen and dusk, leaving Mara in the thundering calm of crickets beginning their night song. [571]  
She carried the finished stone to the village green at dawn; people gathered, touched the carved line, and wept without knowing why, their tears watering the grass where butterflies would feed next year. [613]  
That night, Mara returned to the greenhouse, now quiet, and laid the ribbon roll on the bench; she would begin a new custom, trading poems with the living and the dead alike, until every grief had found its wing. [658]  
Outside, the first stars appeared like chisel marks in the dark, and Mara breathed the scent of citrus and loam, fiercely meditative, listening for the next thundering calm that would call her to carve again. [700]  
In the hush, she felt the collective grief shift, no longer a stone but a flock taking shape against the sky, and she whispered her mother’s stanza once more, letting the words follow the butterflies into the night. [750
