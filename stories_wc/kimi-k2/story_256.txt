The kindly guard, whose badge read “CLOUD CAFE SECURITY,” stood watch inside the floating island’s glass-walled pantry during the hush of a grocery store at midnight, when even the espresso machines slept. <words>34</words>
He clutched a basic measuring spoon like a rosary, its worn tablespoon bowl catching the moonlight that seeped through cirrus curtains. <words>24</words>
Time here had soft edges; minutes dripped like latte foam, pooling into hours that tasted faintly of vanilla regret. <words>19</words>
He was loyally disloyal to the cafe’s owner, a tyrant barista who hoarded sugar rations, yet he stayed because the horizon’s hidden promise shimmered just beyond the island’s silver railing. <words>30</words>
Each night he worshipped that promise by pacing the aisles with the rhythm of a typewriter’s keys, heel-toe, heel-toe, tapping devotion into the rubber mats. <words>28</words>
Tonight the spoon trembled in his palm as he measured out exactly one tablespoon of stolen stardust, the secret ingredient that kept the island aloft. <words>25</words>
If he poured it into the wind, the cafe would drift toward the horizon; if he returned it, the tyrant would wake to frothy despair and demote him to dishwasher. <words>29</words>
He remembered the owner’s sneer: “Kindness is foam; it collapses.” <words>11</words>
Still, the guard’s heart beat in soft edges, blurring duty and dream. <words>12</words>
He set the spoon on the scale, watched the digital numbers flicker like hesitant fireflies. <words>16</words>
One gram short. <words>3</words>
He scraped the spoon’s rim against the stardust jar, the metallic scrape echoing with the rhythm of a typewriter’s keys, each scrape a letter in his unwritten resignation. <words>27</words>
Outside, the horizon glowed violet, a promise whispering his name in flavors he had never tasted. <words>18</words>
He lifted the spoon, felt its weight anchor him to the present, then released it into the open air. <words>19</words>
The stardust scattered, a constellation of tiny betrayals. <words>8</words>
The island lurched, crockery clinking like distant applause. <words>9</words>
He braced against a shelf of canned peaches, their syrup sloshing in frothy despair. <words>14</words>
Through the window he saw the horizon rushing closer, its hidden promise unfolding into a sunrise that tasted of cinnamon and forgiveness. <words>22</words>
Behind him, the tyrant’s alarm clock began to scream. <words>9</words>
The guard smiled, loyally disloyal to the end, and stepped onto the railing where time blurred into soft edges and the wind typed his future in invisible ink. <words>27</words>
He seized the horizon’s hidden promise with both hands, letting the measuring spoon fall like a spent cartridge into the clouds below. <words>23</words>
As the cafe floated beyond the tyrant’s reach, the kindly guard bowed his head, worshipping the new dawn with the rhythm of a typewriter’s keys still echoing in his pulse. <words>30</words>
