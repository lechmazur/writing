The solemn swordsman entered the magician’s laboratory in a toppled clock tower, gears frozen mid-tick, while shifting sands erase footprints through the shattered rose window. <words>25</words>
He carried a basic wooden box, its lid warped, hinges rusted, yet it opened and closed with a functionally dysfunctional sigh that matched his own guarded breathing. <words>20</words>
Inside lay a single seed and a trail of poems leading to a secret garden, each stanza inked on rice paper that fluttered like captive moths. <words>18</words>
He read the first: “Root grief in loam, let memory bloom,” and felt mild fervor stir beneath his sternum, a heat he had not allowed since the war. <words>20</words>
The second poem directed him to localize the garden’s entrance beneath the pendulum’s shadow, where time pooled like spilled mercury. <words>16</words>
He stepped carefully, counting heartbeats against the tower’s dying ticks, while shifting sands erase footprints behind him, erasing retreat. <words>16</words>
A third poem warned: “Only the broken sheathe may draw living steel,” so he set the wooden box on a cracked workbench, its surface littered with failed homunculi and wilted cuttings. <words>21</words>
The swordsman knelt, palms open, admitting he was functionally dysfunctional, a blade that guarded but could no longer cut. <words>15</words>
The trail of poems thickened into vines of script, curling around alembics and retorts, guiding him deeper into the magician’s laboratory in a toppled clock tower. <words>18</words>
He found the fourth poem etched into a copper leaf: “Track evolutionary changes by the scent of regret,” and he inhaled, recognizing his own. <words>17</words>
At the pendulum’s base, a trapdoor sighed open, revealing stairs spiraling down through strata of forgotten hours, while shifting sands erase footprints above. <words>18</words>
Each step downward triggered a stanza to glow on the wooden box’s lid, illuminating the solemn swordsman’s face with mild fervor. <words>16</words>
The fifth poem instructed: “Plant the seed where yesterday’s blood feeds tomorrow’s bloom,” so he pressed it into soil that smelled of rust and roses. <words>17</words>
Roots cracked the box apart, the functionally dysfunctional container finally fulfilling its hidden purpose, crumbling into mulch around the seedling. <words>16</words>
The garden unfolded like a book of hours, petals opening into eyes, leaves whispering names he had tried to forget, while shifting sands erase footprints at the threshold. <words>20</words>
He drew his sword, not to fight, but to measure the evolutionary changes in his own reflection across the mirrored pond at the garden’s heart. <words>18</words>
A final poem appeared on the water: “Garden wisdom: growth is surrender to what wounds you,” and the solemn swordsman sheathed his blade in the earth. <words>17</words>
Mild fervor became quiet resolve as he vowed to tend the secret garden, to track evolutionary changes within himself, while shifting sands erase footprints and poems alike. <words>20</words>
