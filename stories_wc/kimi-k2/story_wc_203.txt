The overhead fluorescent buzz died off at 2:17 a.m., and the abandoned circus ticket office sank into a hush so complete that even the dust seemed to pause mid-fall. [34]  
Mara Lin, elevator repair technician and reluctant ghost-seer, set her toolbox on the warped counter and waited for the familiar chill that announced company. [50]  
Tonight the chill arrived as a slow frost across the brass bars of the old cash cage, spelling out the word LOOK in letters that evaporated before she could exhale. [70]  
She had come here not for broken cables but for ceilings, driven by the weightless burden of knowing that every shaft she serviced hid something above the car—something the ghosts pointed at but never named. [97]  
The ticket office had once sold dreams for a quarter; now it sold silence, and Mara intended to discover what price the silence exacted. [117]  
She removed the horologist’s mainspring barrel from her coat pocket, a smooth cylinder no larger than a shot glass, its polished steel catching the moonlight that leaked through the striped canvas roof. [147]  
The barrel had belonged to her grandfather, a circus timekeeper who claimed the spring inside measured heartbeats instead of hours; he had died here during the final performance, and the ghosts had been nudging her toward this room ever since. [183]  
Mara placed the barrel on the counter, aligning its etched twelve o’clock mark with a crack in the Formica, and felt the floorboards sigh as if relieved to be noticed. [213]  
She was skillfully observant, trained by years of reading elevator shafts like cardiograms, and the dust here told a story more intricate than any mechanical blueprint. [243]  
Instead of the usual even film, particles had drifted into crescents and spirals, patterns that rose toward the ceiling like frozen applause. [268]  
Analyzing dust accumulation patterns was her method; dust obeyed gravity but remembered every disturbance, and tonight it remembered footsteps that left no prints. [295]  
She traced a spiral with her fingertip, feeling the grit cling to skin still warm from the living world, and the ghosts crowded closer, their breath frosting the air in small halos. [325]  
One of them, a woman in a moth-eaten usherette uniform, pointed upward with a gesture that cracked the façade of Mara’s skepticism like thin ice. [350]  
Mara understood: engage or be forever engaged. [362]  
She climbed onto the counter, boots creaking, and pressed her palm against the sagging plaster ceiling; it felt warm, pulsing faintly, as if the room itself had a heart tucked between lath and lathe. [398]  
The mainspring barrel vibrated, its internal coil humming a note that matched the pulse overhead. [418]  
With a screwdriver she pried loose a section of plaster, revealing not rafters but a narrow shaft lined with mirrors, each reflecting her face at a different age—child, teen, woman, ghost. [456]  
The ghosts surged forward, merging into the reflections until the mirrors showed only empty costumes drifting in midair, the performers long gone but the applause still suspended. [490]  
Mara realized the ceiling hid time itself, compressed and coiled like the spring in her pocket, waiting for someone to wind it back or let it snap. [520]  
She fitted the mainspring barrel into a cavity at the shaft’s base; it clicked home with the sound of a ticket being punched. [545]  
The mirrors rippled, and the dust patterns on the counter rearranged into a single sentence written in cursive ash: THANK YOU FOR ATTENDING. [573]  
The weightless burden lifted, replaced by a lightness that made her feel simultaneously empty and complete, as if she had stepped out of her own skin and found it still fit. [610]  
The fluorescent bulb flickered once, buzzed, and held steady, banishing the ghosts to whatever interval they now belonged. [635]  
Mara retrieved her toolbox, left the mainspring barrel humming softly in its socket, and walked out beneath a ceiling that no longer hid anything—because it had finally shown her everything. [675]  
Outside, dawn painted the abandoned midway in pastels, and somewhere a calliope exhaled a single, perfect note that sounded exactly like her grandfather’s laugh. [708]  
She did not look back; she had learned that some cracks are invitations, not flaws, and that every façade, once broken, becomes a doorway. [740]  
The elevator company would wonder why she never returned, but Mara knew her next shaft would be the sky itself, its cables made of light, its ceiling the turning stars. [775]  
And in the ticket office, the mainspring barrel kept perfect time for an audience of dust motes, each one dancing to the silent
