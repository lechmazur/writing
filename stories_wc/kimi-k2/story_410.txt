<story>
The astute hermit, who had once been the city's chief hydrologist, now lived alone in a cavern cathedral alive with phosphorescent flora, where glowing moss dripped like tears from vaulted stone ceilings. <words>34</words>
He clutched a blunt scissor—his only tool—remembering how it had strangely effective power to cut through the fibrous roots that choked the ancient aqueducts, though it couldn't sever his memories of the drought above. <words>37</words>
For seven years, isolation had amplified every sound: the drip of water through limestone, the whisper of his own breathing, and worst of all, the phantom laughter of colleagues who'd died when the reservoirs failed. <words>34</words>
At the moment an elevator arrives to an empty floor—the one he'd abandoned when the city fled—he stood in his underground sanctuary, inhaling the scent of a fresh loaf of bread he'd baked from the last of his stored grain. <words>42</words>
The smell, rich and obscene in this place of perpetual damp, made him laugh—a despairing humor that echoed off crystal formations like the city's final joke before collapse. <words>30</words>
He'd come here to restore water systems, driven by guilt that gnawed deeper than hunger, believing that if he could reopen the underground springs, perhaps the survivors would return, perhaps he'd stop dreaming of children's cracked lips. <words>42</words>
But the springs had dried to trickles, and his blunt scissor, strangely effective against roots, proved useless against the calcified heart of the earth itself. <words>29</words>
Each day, isolation taught him new mathematics: one loaf divided by infinite regret equals a feast of sorrow, one drop of water multiplied by memory becomes an ocean of shame. <words>31</words>
The phosphorescent flora pulsed brighter as he approached the central cistern, their bioluminescence responding to his body heat like sympathetic ghosts. <words>23</words>
He'd discovered that their glow intensified near moisture, creating living maps of water's absence—a cruel irony that made him laugh until he wept, his tears adding infinitesimal volume to the barren pool. <words>36</words>
The elevator's arrival above meant nothing now; he'd disabled it years ago after the last refugee left, unable to bear another witness to his failure. <words>27</words>
Yet the bread's scent persisted, amplifying his hunger for redemption, reminding him that even in this tomb, something could still rise. <words>25</words>
He pressed his blunt scissor against the limestone, carving not his name but a single word: "SORRY"—strangely effective as both confession and epitaph. <words>27</words>
As the phosphorescent flora dimmed with his departing warmth, he understood that restoring water systems mattered less than admitting he'd never tried to restore the human ones above. <words>34</words>
The hermit ate his bread slowly, savoring each bite of despairing humor, knowing that tomorrow he'd climb toward the elevator, toward the empty floor, toward whatever remained of the world he'd abandoned to save. <words>38</words>
