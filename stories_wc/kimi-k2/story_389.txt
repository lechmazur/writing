<story>
The thin-lipped warlock, dressed in a formally casual tweed jacket over silk pajamas, stepped through the rusted mine gate as the final calendar page of the year was flipped by a cold subterranean wind. <words>34</words>
He carried only a cracked fragment of a viking ship figurehead, its snarling dragon mouth still warm from the hearth where he had pried it loose. <words>25</words>
In the forgotten library inside the abandoned mine, shelves sagged under discredited textbooks whose rumored cures promised to optimize the mind beyond mortal limits. <words>24</words>
He had come to gorge on the fruit of knowledge despite warnings scratched into the stone by previous scholars whose bones now served as bookmarks. <words>23</words>
The warlock's thin lips moved in a silent equation, calculating how many lost artifacts of thought he could swallow before the certainty he craved dissolved into the confusion he feared. <words>27</words>
He opened a leather-bound volume titled "On Transmuting Ignorance," its pages fluttering like dying moths, and pressed the figurehead fragment against a diagram of a dragon devouring its own tail. <words>27</words>
The book's ink rearranged itself into a recipe: one fragment of voyager's wood, three drops of midnight oil, and the reader's willingness to forget their own name. <words>25</words>
With formally casual precision, he followed the instructions, slicing his thumb to add blood to the mixture, feeling the mine's darkness thicken into something almost breathable. <words>24</words>
The dragon carved on the figurehead opened its wooden eyes and spoke in a voice like grinding glaciers: "You seek to optimize what cannot be contained." <words>24</words>
The warlock laughed, a sound like dry pages turning, and replied, "I have already eaten the warnings; they tasted like certainty." <words>21</words>
The shelves began to shift, revealing deeper alcoves where more lost artifacts waitedâ€”crystallized screams, bottled eclipses, and a single apple with a bite taken from every side. <words>26</words>
He reached for the apple, but his hand passed through it, encountering instead the cold metal of the mine's elevator cage, which had not existed moments before. <words>25</words>
Inside the cage hung another discredited textbook, its cover reading "Exit Strategies for Those Who Know Too Much." <words>19</words>
The warlock's thin lips trembled as he realized the confusing certainty he sought had already optimized him into a footnote in someone else's forgotten library. <words>24</words>
The elevator began to rise, carrying him toward a surface he could no longer remember, while behind him the dragon figurehead fragment crumbled into sawdust that spelled out: "Knowledge devours its own map." <words>32</words>
As the final grain of sawdust settled, the library sighed and rearranged itself, preparing for the next scholar who would mistake hunger for wisdom. <words>23</words>
