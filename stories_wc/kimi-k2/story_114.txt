After the last breath of the dying god, the shared dream recording studio flickered awake, its walls humming with leftover divinity. <words>21</words>
In the deserted hall, empty frames hung like open mouths, waiting for someone to unfold their silence. <words>34</words>
The apathetic summoner shuffled in, clutching a rustic coffee grinder as if it were a relic, not a tool. <words>47</words>
He had no spells left, only the memory of coral reefs collapsing like wet paper, and the god’s final whisper: “Rebuild.” <words>62</words>
He was enthusiastically lazy, so instead of casting, he ground beans with slow, circular devotion, letting the aroma braid with the studio’s dream-static. <words>78</words>
Each turn of the crank released a note of river wisdom—soft, silted, and sharp enough to cut regret. <words>91</words>
The frames began to glow, matching the rhythm of the grinder, their emptiness trembling into possibility. <words>104</words>
He yawned, apathy draped over him like a quilt, yet his fingers kept moving, too lazy to stop the ritual they’d accidentally started. <words>118</words>
Dreams leaked from the frames: turquoise water, polyps blooming like chandeliers, the hush of tides correcting human error. <words>132</words>
He watched, unmoved, until one frame showed his own hands scattering ground coffee into a reef, the grounds sprouting coral faster than guilt. <words>148</words>
The studio’s air sharpened, gentle as a scalpel, carving open his chest without permission. <words>161</words>
He tasted river wisdom then—not knowledge, but surrender, the way water yields yet shapes stone. <words>174</words>
The summoner exhaled, letting the last of the god’s breath mingle with steam from the grinder. <words>187</words>
Frames unfolded into doorways; through them, dying reefs rewound their bleaching, color rushing back like blood to a cheek. <words>202</words>
He stepped through, still holding the grinder, its handle now turning itself, enthusiastically lazy, like a pet that knows the way home. <words>217</words>
Underwater, the coffee grounds dissolved into calcium, into memory, into the architecture of forgiveness. <words>230</words>
Fish returned, wearing scales of recorded dreams, their movements syncing with the studio’s residual heartbeat. <words>244</words>
The summoner floated, apathy finally rinsed clean, replaced by the gentle sharpness of salt against new skin. <words>258</words>
He understood: rebuilding wasn’t labor but listening, letting the river speak through empty frames and full hearts. <words>272</words>
The studio dimmed, its purpose spent, yet the frames remained, now filled with living reefs that pulsed like slow applause. <words>287</words>
He surfaced, grinder rusting in his grip, its job done, its song complete. <words>299</words>
On the shore, he planted the grinder like a seed, handle still turning in the breeze, grinding starlight into sand. <words>313</words>
Each grain carried river wisdom, ready to be dreamed by the next apathetic soul who wandered in after the last breath. <words>328</words>
He walked away, neither hero nor summoner, just a man who had matched emptiness with emptiness until something grew. <words>344</words>
Behind him, the studio collapsed into coral, its walls becoming the very reefs it had recorded, a gentle sharpness against the tide. <words>360</words>
The god’s final exhale lingered as foam, whispering, “Keep unfolding,” before dissolving into moonlit brine. <words>375</words>
And so the summoner did, lazily, enthusiastically, one frame at a time, until the ocean forgot how to die. <words>390</words>
