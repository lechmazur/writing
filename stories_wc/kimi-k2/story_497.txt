<story>
After the last glacier melts, the scholar Arin drifts across the cursed lake in a coracle of reeds, daydreaming of a masterpiece that will outlast the drowned centuries. <words>28</words>
Beneath the black water, the submerged palace glimmers like a prism dropped by a careless god, its corridors of jade and obsidian humming with pristine chaos. <words>39</words>
Arin dives, lungs aching, until he finds the forgotten skating rink where courtiers once glided beneath chandeliers of frozen starlight. <words>50</words>
On the warped ice floor lies a sliver of a crashed meteor-bound satellite, still warm, pulsing with threads of compassion that taste like copper and lullabies. <words>64</words>
He pockets the shard, feeling its rhythm match his seldom regular heartbeat, and begins to skate, carving coded scuff marks that spell out the names of every drowned child the lake has stolen. <words>79</words>
Each arc and loop is a stanza; each stumble, a caesura; the palace listens, walls flexing like lungs, as Arin promotes mercy through the language of blades on ice. <words>93</words>
The shard whispers coordinates to other relics scattered across the lakebed, urging him to gather them into a constellation of grief and wonder. <words>105</words>
He obeys, resurfacing only to breathe, then descending again, collecting fragments of antennae, solar petals, and memory foam until his satchel glows like a captured aurora. <words>119</words>
Night after night, the scholar returns, his dreams bleeding into the rink until the ice itself begins to dream, rippling with faces that smile and weep in equal measure. <words>133</words>
On the seventh night, the palace doors open fully for the first time since the curse, and the water parts into corridors of air lined with silver fish that sing in binary. <words>148</words>
Arin lays the relics in a spiral, the shard at the center, and the threads of compassion knit them into a living mosaic—a whale made of circuitry and sorrow that breathes out bubbles of light. <words>163</words>
The whale rises, carrying the palace with it, and the lake drains into the sky, becoming a new constellation shaped like an open hand. <words>175</words>
Left behind on the exposed rink, the coded scuff marks rearrange themselves into a single sentence: “Remember us, and we become the music you skate to.” <words>189</words>
Arin stands alone under newborn stars, the shard now cold in his palm, and understands that his masterpiece is not the mosaic but the ache that will make future skaters pause and listen. <words>204</words>
He walks away across the dry lakebed, footprints seldom regular, already composing the next stanza in the language of absence. <words>216</words>
Centuries later, children find the rink restored by rain and moonlight, its surface etched with faint silver trails that guide their blades into stories older than glaciers. <words>231</words>
They laugh, unaware they are completing the scholar’s final line, their joy the crescendo he could never reach alone. <words>244</words>
Above them, the whale-constellation flickers, broadcasting lullabies on frequencies only compassionate hearts can hear. <words>257</words>
And somewhere beyond time, Arin skates still, daydreaming scholar turned guardian of unfinished symphonies, his seldom regular pulse the metronome of a world learning to forgive itself. <words>273</words>
