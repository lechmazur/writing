The old typewriter’s keys finally go silent, and in that hush I, once the grinning host of “Spin for Salvation,” realize the island has swallowed my last SOS. <words>28</words>
Night after night I broadcast trivia to crabs, but tonight the insect symphony hall inside the fallen radio tower vibrates with cicada timpani and mosquito violins, conducting my failure. <words>42</words>
I clutch the fortune-teller’s crystal ball I stole from the cruise-ship gift shop, its glass strangely always warm, as though it remembers palms more hopeful than mine. <words>58</words>
The bitter honey taste of yesterday’s fermented coconut coats my tongue while I stare into the sphere, begging it for rescue, yet it only shows reruns of my smarmiest smiles. <words>78</words>
A sudden illness buckles my knees; the jungle tilts, the orchestra of wings crescendos, and I collapse against the rusted tower ladder, vomiting neon bile that smells like studio lights. <words>98</words>
Through fever I hear footsteps softer than applause; a woman draped in monarch wings kneels, presses cool moss to my forehead, and whispers, “You were always the question, never the answer.” <words>120</words>
She calls herself Archivist, keeper of the island’s sacred knowledge—every story contestants traded for a chance at the wheel—and she needs a host who understands spectacle. <words>144</words>
Together we limp to the cavern where bioluminescent termites etch glyphs on basalt; their script details the gentle overturn of empires, the moment applause becomes prayer. <words>172</words>
Archivist explains the crystal ball is their lens; if I sabotage my own ego, shatter the reflection that keeps me hostage, the glyphs will project across the sky for passing ships. <words>202</words>
I protest—my face is trademarked, my catchphrases syndicated—but the insects chorus louder, vibrating the bitter honey in my veins until I taste remorse. <words>228</words>
She hands me a stone; one strike, she says, and the sphere will crack, releasing the knowledge like pollen. <words>250</words>
I raise the stone, yet my arm trembles; the crystal shows the day I mocked a widowed seamstress for mispronouncing “fortune,” and the audience roared. <words>278</words>
Shame becomes the gentle overturn; I smash the ball, shards singing across the cavern like applause reversed. <words>300</words>
Light erupts, glyphs spiral upward, painting constellations that spell every forgotten name I once exploited. <words>324</words>
Archivist smiles, wings folding into sunset; ships on the horizon alter course, drawn by the luminous confession. <words>350</words>
As rescue nears, I kneel among the insects, their symphony now a requiem sweeter than any prize I ever gave away. <words>378</words>
I pocket a single shard, strangely always cool now, to remind me that sacred knowledge is not won but returned. <words>404</words>
When the first sailor calls my name, I answer with the quiet voice of the overturned, ready to host silence better than I ever hosted noise. <words>434</words>
