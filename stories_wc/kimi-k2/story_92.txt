In the haunted mansion dining room, where color bleeds from day into night, I wait for Mrs. Van der Sloot's borzoi, leash coiled like a silent agreement around my wrist. <words>31</words>
The dog walker for the ultra-rich learns to be carefully careless: one slack grip, one missed step, and the hound slips toward the long table where her botanical collection of night-blooming cereus trembles in the loud silence. <words>42</words>
Petals unfold like accusations, and I justify my presence by whispering that I only trespass where fear dares not tread, though my pulse drums louder than any scream. <words>32</words>
The borzoi noses a glass dome, releasing a ghost of chloroform and old roses; the air thickens, and the room remembers every toast ever poisoned here. <words>28</words>
I signed no contract, only nodded when Mrs. Van der Sloot said, “Walk him at dusk, never speak of what you see,” a silent agreement sealed by the cut on her thumb and the drop of blood she let fall onto the dog’s fur. <words>44</words>
Tonight the cut has reopened; the blood smells of iron and lilies, and the dog leads me not outside but deeper, past portraits whose eyes smear like wet paint. <words>32</words>
At the foot of the table lies an invitation: a blood drive in the village square, tomorrow, sunset, donors welcome, secrets optional. <words>25</words>
I pocket it, feeling the paper throb like a second heartbeat, and wonder if the mansion itself has veins. <words>22</words>
The borzoi stops beneath a chandelier of black crystal; moonlight fractures across the floor, spelling a name I refuse to read aloud. <words>26</words>
I kneel, carefully careless, pretending to tie a lace while tracing the letters: my own, misspelled in dust and guilt. <words>25</words>
Mrs. Van der Sloot appears in the doorway, silhouette stitched from dusk, and we share the loudest silence of my life. <words>25</words>
She lifts her bandaged hand; the dog licks the wound, sealing again what should never open. <words>21</words>
I justify staying by promising myself that tomorrow I will stand where fear dares not tread—the blood drive—where needles glint like chandelier shards and every pint surrendered is a confession. <words>39</words>
She gestures toward the cereus; midnight has arrived, and the flowers collapse, having bled their perfume into the room’s hungry mouth. <words>29</words>
I understand: the botanical collection drinks memory, the mansion drinks color, and I am the cup they pass between them. <words>27</words>
The borzoi whimpers; I clip the leash, careful now, careless no longer, and together we walk toward the front doors that open without touch. <words>30</words>
Outside, night has finished draining the last blue from the sky; inside, the dining room exhales, satisfied until tomorrow’s dusk. <words>27</words>
At the blood drive, I will roll up my sleeve, meet the gaze of the nurse who already knows my name, and honor the silent agreement that some debts can only be paid in crimson. <words>38</words>
