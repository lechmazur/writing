The hedge maze designer pressed her palm against the living bridge garden's oldest arch, feeling the slow pulse of sap beneath bark. [24] She had built this place to hide the halo fragment, but now the photographs in her pocket were fading faster than memory itself. [38] Each image showed the same impossible angle of the maze—taken from a vantage that shouldn't exist, retrocognitively trapping her between what was and what might have been. [58] The garden's bridges breathed with her, their living wood responding to her quaking reverie as she studied the latest print: her own face, younger, standing beside a woman she'd never met. [82] The halo fragment hummed beneath the central fountain, its crystalline edges cutting through dimensions she could only glimpse through hyperbolic geometry. [103] She'd discovered that time had texture here—rough as bark where the future pressed against the past, smooth as water where moments flowed together. [130] The photographs were her maps, but as they disintegrated in her hands, she felt herself dissolving with them. [149] Yesterday she'd found a picture of tomorrow's sunset, already half-gone, showing the maze rearranged into patterns that hurt to perceive. [172] Her fingers traced the living bridge's grain, following its spiral growth that defied Euclidean space. [194] The halo fragment had fallen from heaven—or perhaps through it—shattering into pieces that bent reality around their edges. [217] She'd built the maze to contain its influence, but instead she'd created a amplifier, each hedge a antenna receiving signals from when and where. [245] The fading photographs showed her what the fragment wanted her to see: herself as a child, planting the first seed of what would become this impossible garden. [275] But she had no childhood memories of this place—she'd discovered it fully grown, retrocognitively trapped by its own future history. [300] Through hyperbolic geometry, she'd learned to navigate the maze's true pathways, those that existed in the negative spaces between seconds. [328] The living bridges grew according to temporal tides, their branches reaching toward moments rather than sunlight. [350] She'd watched visitors disappear into the maze's depths, following paths that existed only in the photographs' fading emulsions. [375] The halo fragment sang to her of time's texture—how some moments were velvet-soft and others sharp as broken glass. [398] She'd touched those textures through the maze, feeling years slip between her fingers like water. [418] Now the final photograph showed her own disintegration, her body becoming transparent as the halo fragment pulled her into its crystalline lattice. [447] Through hyperbolic geometry, she'd discovered that she was not the maze's creator but its creation—a living photograph developed in the darkroom between seconds. [478] The fading images revealed her true nature: a woman retrocognitively trapped by her own future, building a maze that had already built her. [507] The living bridge garden had grown from the halo fragment's heart, its roots drinking from the well of time itself. [532] She understood now that to discover the texture of time was to become it—to let oneself disintegrate into the infinite folds of when. [562] The halo fragment rose from the fountain, its crystalline planes reflecting not light but duration itself. [585] Through hyperbolic geometry, she saw the maze's true form: a Möbius strip of moments, endlessly turning inside-out through itself. [614] The fading photographs were not records but ingredients—each dissolving image adding to the temporal stew that was her existence. [642] As the last picture vanished, she felt herself retrocognitively trapped in the moment of her own creation, watching herself design the maze that would design her. [674] The living bridges sang with her voice, though her mouth had not yet opened. [692] Through hyperbolic geometry, she stepped into the halo fragment, feeling herself disintegrate across the infinite textures of time—rough as bark, smooth as water, sharp as broken glass. [730] In her quaking reverie, she finally understood: she was not in the maze but of it, a living photograph fading into the garden's eternal growth. [760] The halo fragment accepted her, and she became what she had always been—the texture of time itself, rough and smooth and sharp, endlessly turning through the living bridge garden's impossible pathways.
