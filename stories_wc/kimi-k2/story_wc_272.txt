The lighthouse library had not been entered since the lens cracked and the sea swallowed the lower stairs. [21]
Inside, dust drifted like pale plankton through the single beam that still found its way down the spiral. [34]
A crestfallen portrait artist named Lira stood at the iron railing, clutching a broken tarot card box whose lid had split along the image of the moon. [55]
She had come to paint the keeper’s last likeness, only to learn the keeper had vanished into the tide a decade earlier, leaving portraits to warp on salt-stained walls. [83]
Each canvas showed a face she almost recognized, as though her own reflection had been cut into strips and rearranged by a careless child. [104]
The longer she stared, the more the corridors seemed to breathe, shelves inching inward like ribs. [121]
When the walls close in, the manuals warned, the mind must descend into necessary darkness or be pressed into paper itself. [144]
Lira whispered, “Is the dark any darker than the ache of a face no one remembers?” [162]
The question hung, rhetorical, yet the library answered with a soft rustle of vellum wings. [178]
She opened the fractured box; the cards inside had been torn and shuffled by damp, their pictures bleeding into one another. [200]
The hanged man wore the empress’s crown, the tower sprouted roses, and every figure stared out with her own eyes. [222]
Reality, she realized, had become as fragmented as the cards, each symbol sliding into the next without boundary. [244]
To survive the narrowing corridor, she would have to redesign the order of things. [261]
She lifted the first card—what had been the moon was now a silver key—and began to untangle threads of paint that dripped from the warped portraits. [287]
Each thread was a memory: a laugh, a betrayal, a color mixed at dawn. [301]
She pulled them gently, looping them around her fingers, weaving them into a new pattern on the cracked floorboards. [321]
The lighthouse groaned; the walls exhaled chalk and cedar. [333]
“Who owns a memory once the face is gone?” she asked the dark, knowing no voice would reply. [352]
Yet the dark flickered, luminescent, as if pain itself could phosphoresce. [367]
She worked until the cards lay in a circle, edges touching like stitched wounds. [383]
In the center she placed her own self-portrait, the only canvas still blank. [398]
With a sable brush she drew a door, then stepped through it, not forward but downward, into the shaft where the stairs had rotted away. [425]
The descent was not falling but folding, each rung of absent ladder a question she had already asked. [447]
“Does the portrait paint the painter?” she murmured, voice echoing off unseen stone. [465]
Salt water kissed her ankles, then her knees; the necessary darkness tasted of brine and ink. [485]
At the bottom she found the keeper, or what remained: a skeleton seated at a desk made of encyclopedias, fingers still curled around a pen that glowed faintly. [515]
Across the desk lay a single tarot card intact—the world—its edges unmarred, its center a mirror. [537]
Lira sat opposite the bones and began to sketch, not the skull but the light inside it. [556]
With every stroke, the ache in her chest brightened, sharp and clean. [571]
The library above sighed, walls retreating a fraction, granting the dust more room to drift. [589]
She understood then that redesign is not escape but acceptance rendered visible. [608]
She left the finished portrait propped against the keeper’s ribs, a face neither hers nor his but both, glowing like plankton in deep water. [635]
Climbing back up the absent stairs, she felt the threads she had woven tug gently, anchoring her to the new pattern. [659]
In the lantern room, dawn bled through the cracked lens, scattering rainbow fractures across the tarot circle. [680]
The broken box lay closed; the cards inside had settled into a single image: a lighthouse whose beam pointed downward into waves that reflected stars. [708]
Lira pressed her palm to the glass and whispered one last rhetorical question: “If the dark is where we paint our truest light, why do we fear the fall?” [740]
The lighthouse did not answer, but the sea below shimmered, as though every drowned portrait had opened its eyes. [762]
She smiled, crest no longer fallen, and began to descend the outer stairs for the first time in ten years, carrying only the memory of luminescent ache. [790]
