The last crimson petal drifted from the rosebush outside Kira's neon sign repair shop, marking the hour she had dreaded for seven years. <words>25</words>
She set down her soldering iron, guilt coiling tighter than the copper wire in her hands, and lifted the tribal mask from beneath the workbench. <words>20</words>
Its labyrinthine carvings caught the shop's violet glow, each groove a whispered promise of absolution she no longer believed she deserved. <words>19</words>
The swordswoman who once danced through battlefields now repaired flickering OPEN signs, her reserved boldness manifesting in the precise way she traced the mask's patterns without flinching. <words>22</words>
Three historians had told her three different lies about the door of release, each half-truth a breadcrumb she followed through their contradictions. <words>20</words>
Old Chen claimed it opened only to those who'd never killed; Maria insisted it required blood payment; while drunken Thompson swore it existed solely in the space between regret and forgiveness. <words>26</words>
Kira had learned to glean secrets from their inconsistencies, noting how Chen's left eye twitched when he lied, how Maria's fingers drummed the table during omissions, how Thompson's voice softened when approaching truth. <words>28</words>
Tonight, after the final petal fell, she would pursue the door itself—not through their words, but through the mask's maze that matched the scars mapping her ribs. <words>24</words>
The shop's neon tubes hummed their electric lullaby as she pressed the mask to her face, feeling the carvings align with old wounds like puzzle pieces clicking home. <words>23</words>
Behind her eyelids, the labyrinth became a corridor of violet light stretching beyond the shop's walls, beyond the city, beyond the weight of every life she'd taken with her blade. <words>25</words>
She stepped forward with the same measured precision she'd once used to parry death, each footfall a question mark in the mellow intensity of her resolve. <words>22</words>
The historians' half-truths crystallized into understanding: the door wasn't a threshold but a choice—to carry guilt like armor or set it down like broken neon. <words>23</words>
Kira walked deeper into the mask's maze, her swordswoman's discipline keeping her steps steady even as her heart hammered against the unknown. <words>21</words>
At the corridor's end, she found not a door but a mirror reflecting her younger self before the first blood, before the neon shop, before the guilt became her shadow. <words>23</words>
The reflection reached through the glass—not to pull her back, but to offer the choice she'd been seeking: to step through and become someone new, or turn away and remain the sum of her sins. <words>29</words>
Kira extended her hand, reserved boldness guiding her fingers through the mirror's surface like water, feeling the release she'd hunted not in absolution but in acceptance. <words>24</words>
Behind her, the neon signs flickered once, twice, then burned steady and bright, illuminating an empty shop where a guilty swordswoman had finally laid down her burden. <words>24</words>
