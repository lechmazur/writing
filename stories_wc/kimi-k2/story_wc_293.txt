The bridge-song fiddler arrives at the mountain scenic pullout an hour after the hitchhiker vanishes. [18]  
He parks his dented station wagon beside the only lamppost whose bulb still remembers light. [29]  
Wind carries the hush of tires on distant gravel, but he hears none of it; he is listening for one note that refuses to leave. [52]  
Inside his pocket, a wet-plate collodion glass flake rests against his heartbeat like a fractured mirror of memory. [78]  
To anyone else it is only slivered silver, yet to him it holds the single photograph of the hitchhiker’s last smile, the one recorded by antique chemicals before she dissolved into dusk. [116]  
He sets up his fiddle on the parapet, strings glinting like ice on a river. [140]  
The sound that slides out is neither melody nor cry; it is a questioning, a dynamically observant tremor that asks the night exactly where a person can go when the world folds her into its seams. [214]  
He plays the same stanza four times before the echo recasts itself into words. [245]  
“Recount,” it seems to say, though the voice belongs to no throat but to the iron rail vibrating against his shoulder. [282]  
He understands. [285]  
A secret mapped by scaffold wrap flutters beside the lamppost; torn polypropylene twists in the updraft, revealing a latticework of chalky fingerprints. [317]  
Each print points toward the edge where concrete crumbles into pines. [342]  
He follows, playing softly, allowing the bow to translate distance into tone. [373]  
Every step the scaffold wrap peels further, unwrapping a corridor of canvas banners once hung to screen the highway from erosion. [425]  
They now serve as a whispered blueprint of the woman who walked here after dark, marking her heel strikes as Morse on loose gravel. [470]  
Halfway down the scree the fiddler finds the flare of footprints ending at nothing. [500]  
Still, the photograph waits in the glass flake; he tilts it under starlight, coaxing the chemicals to reopen. [533]  
The image pixellates from edge to center, silver grains dividing themselves into squares of shadow and glare until the girl stands inside a grid of amnesty—neither erased nor preserved but granted passage to live elsewhere the moment she steps outside the frame. [630]  
He sets the flake on a slab of red shale and begins to sculpt her possibility from the ashes of “never.” [672]  
Drawing the bow across a single A harmonic, he shapes the air into an archway of vibrating light. [710]  
Pixels coalesce above the shard like miniature glass wings. [730]  
When the final bow stroke fades, the flake is empty, and the scaffold wrap lies still, its secret now shared. [769]  
He replaces the violin in its scarred case, shoulders pack, and walks back uphill, luminous disbelief glowing in the hollow of his chest. [820]  
Behind him the pullout keeps quiet watch, a cliff face newly smoothed as if a hand had ironed the night. [865]  
No hitchhiker waves, yet every mile from here to morning now holds the chord he left hanging in the air. [908]  
The bridge-song travels on, pixelated amnesty riding every set of headlights that crests the pass. [945]  
Each driver rolls down the window, thinking they hear a radio, but it is only the afterimage of a promise the fiddler played into the wind. [997]  
Somewhere over the ridge the hitchhiker feels the same vibration at the base of her spine; it tells her she can stop walking because someone chose to give the word never a new geometry of forever. [1076]  
She steps into whatever road opens next, carried by the same luminous disbelief. [1125]  
The fiddler drives away knowing the photograph has been rewound, not into a memory but into an unmade hour still able to turn. [1188]  
The mountain scenic pullout remains, holding its silence like a glass flake cooled and ready to accept the next impossible traveler. [1250]
