The blank-faced performer stood on the farmhouse porch, dried flower bouquet clenched like a brittle promise in one hand, the other already reaching for the pocketknife. [34]
Above him, the giant wind turbines turned with a remade hush, blades slicing the mandated silence that had fallen over the valley after the happiness mandate. [52]
He had arrived at dusk, when the turbines cast long, slow shadows across the fields, and the farmhouse windows reflected nothing but the colorless sky. [70]
Inside, the farmer—morally ambiguous in the way only a grieving parent can be—watched from the doorway, arms folded, eyes unreadable. [88]
The performer began to whittle a sliver of cedar, shavings curling like pale feathers onto the boards, each stroke timed to the turbines’ hushed rotation. [108]
He spoke without looking up, dramatically narrating the mundane task as if it were epic: “Behold, the blade enters the grain, parting memory from memory, carving absence into something that can be held.” [130]
The farmer flinched; the words were soft, yet they struck harder than any shout. [142]
The bouquet had been the farmer’s daughter’s, pressed between dictionary pages the day before the mandate arrived, before joy became law and sorrow contraband. [163]
She had died anyway, quietly, as though even death feared the loudness police. [176]
Now the performer carried the bouquet like evidence, proof that grief could still be smuggled in dried petals and splinters. [194]
He set the half-whittled stick aside, lifted the bouquet, and began to pluck the flowers one by one, dramatically narrating each removal: “This marigold, once laughter in orange, now crumbles into the dust of a joke no one dared finish.” [220]
The farmer stepped closer, drawn by the emotional void that surrounded the performer like a second skin. [235]
“Why come here?” the farmer asked, voice flat, matching the void. [246]
“To cultivate lightness in grief,” the performer replied, “the way wind cultivates motion in still air.” [261]
He placed a petal on the cedar shaving, watched it rest there like a tiny yellow boat. [275]
The turbines hummed their remade hush, a sound engineered to soothe, yet tonight it felt like a lid clamped over screams. [292]
The farmer’s hand twitched toward the bouquet, then withdrew; touching it might break the spell, or break him. [307]
The performer resumed whittling, narrating: “The knife rounds the edge, teaching the wood to forgive the hand that cuts it.” [324]
Shavings piled between them, a pale mound growing like unspoken words. [335]
Outside, the turbines’ shadows lengthened, blades sweeping darkness across the porch in slow, predictable grief. [350]
The farmer finally spoke, voice cracking the void: “She used to run out there, arms wide, trying to catch the wind.” [367]
The performer nodded, blank face never changing, yet something softened behind the emptiness. [380]
He lifted the bouquet again, crushed a brittle stem between thumb and forefinger, dramatically narrating: “This stem once carried color to the sky; now it carries only the memory of color.” [402]
The farmer reached, this time not stopping, and took the crushed stem, rolling it between his own fingers as if testing its reality. [418]
Together they stood, two silhouettes against the farmhouse wall, turbines turning overhead like slow, indifferent clocks. [435]
The performer began the final whittle, narrating softer now: “The last curl falls, and what remains is neither wood nor absence, but a space where both can breathe.” [456]
He handed the finished shape—a small, hollowed heart—to the farmer. [468]
The farmer closed his fist around it, feeling the weight of nothing become something. [480]
The performer placed the last petal inside the hollow, a dried fleck of orange against raw cedar. [494]
Wind from the turbines lifted the shavings, scattering them like pale birds across the darkening yard. [508]
The farmer looked up, eyes finally wet, but the tears made no sound; the mandate had trained even grief to be quiet. [525]
The blank-faced performer stepped back, mission complete, yet his emptiness now carried a faint echo of the farmer’s sorrow. [542]
He turned toward the road, dried flower bouquet reduced to a fistful of dust that slipped between his fingers as he walked. [560]
Behind him, the farmhouse lights flickered on, casting the farmer’s shadow long across the porch, the cedar heart glowing faintly in his hand. [578]
The turbines kept their remade hush, but tonight it sounded almost like a lullaby. [592]
The performer disappeared into the
