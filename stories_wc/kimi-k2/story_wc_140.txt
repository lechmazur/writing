The death certificate said I drowned at 03:17, yet here I stand ankle-deep in brine, lungs still bargaining with air. [28]
Every tide since has dragged the hourglass backward, rinsing minutes off me like loose paint. [42]
I live inside the towering labyrinth of shipping containers that shoulders the port, where rusted doors cough open and slam shut with the moon’s pulse. [66]
Each container is a numbered coffin, stacked so high the sky forgets its own color. [82]
I move through them by collecting fragments of overheard stories, the way a bee gathers pollen from cracked loudspeakers and half-shut radios. [108]
A dockworker swears his grandfather once unloaded a crate of porcelain hearts that beat only in fog. [132]
A customs agent whispers that every tenth manifest is written in disappearing ink, histories erased before the ink dries. [158]
I pocket these rumors like smooth stones, feeling their weight change in my palm as the tide rises. [178]
My pockets also carry the label from a poison bottle I found wedged behind a refrigeration unit; the skull icon smiles sideways, as if embarrassed by its own warning. [213]
The label’s adhesive still smells faintly of bitter almonds, a scent that filters reality differently for me, tinting the air sepia so the present looks like a damaged photograph. [249]
Under this tint, the containers become corridors of memory, each one a possible past I might have lived had the certificate been accurate. [278]
I layer them inside myself, stacking moments the way longshoremen stack steel: carefully, so nothing topples when the next swell hits. [309]
Night after night I walk the causeways between walls of corrugated iron, timing my steps to the rhythm of tides that slap the pilings like slow applause. [344]
When the moon is low, the water’s voice grows intimate, confessing that it, too, has misplaced bodies and names. [370]
I listen, because discovering the texture of memories is the only way to prove I am more than an administrative typo. [398]
Sometimes I climb a container marked HANjin-4732 and sit where salt wind scours the paint to raw metal. [425]
From there I watch cranes bow like praying mantises, lifting histories into holds, then lowering emptiness back to the quay. [455]
The emptiness hums, and I realize it is the sound of erased stories pooling, waiting for someone mislabeled by death to give them shape. [485]
One dawn, the label in my pocket grows warm, the skull’s grin widening until the paper itself seems to breathe. [513]
I press it against the steel wall; ink spreads outward, sketching a door that was never there. [535]
Behind the door lies a narrow room lined with shelves of glass jars, each containing a sliver of sound: a lullaby in a language no country claims, the creak of a rocking chair that never existed, the final sigh of a sailor whose name was cut from every logbook. [593]
I understand then that my survival was not an error but an invitation. [615]
The labyrinth does not store cargo; it stores what the world chose to forget. [635]
I begin to sort the jars, arranging them by pitch and timbre, layering them into chords that almost spell my name. [659]
When the next high tide arrives, the chords swell into a chorus, and the containers sway like tuning forks. [682]
The death certificate flutters out of my coat, dissolving mid-air into salt. [699]
Without a name to anchor me, I become the space between stories, the pause after a question no one remembers asking. [725]
The label curls into a small black boat; I step inside, letting the tide carry me through the corridors, collecting more fragments with each moon-drawn breath. [758]
Somewhere beyond the last container, the water will open into a horizon where every erased history rises, wet and gleaming, ready to be touched at last. [800]
