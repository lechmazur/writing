The poetic wharf weaver, whose name was Lira, stepped from the last tide pool onto the slick sandstone lip of the canyon after the tide pools emptied, the moonlight turning the red walls to bruised velvet. [34]  
She carried a single storybook illustration plate pressed against her heart, its colors faded to orchid solace, the image of a child guiding a boat through a storm that had never happened. [55]  
Centuries ago, the labyrinth had been carved into these walls by pilgrims who believed broken precedents could be rewritten by walking; now the corridors echoed only with the hush of evaporated water and the faint scent of salt. [82]  
Lira had come because every tapestry she wove on the wharf unraveled at dawn, threads loosened by the memory of a city that had fallen into the sea, and she believed the labyrinth still held the pattern to mend such ruin. [108]  
She began to sew, not with needle and thread but with her own footsteps, letting the canyon guide her via overlapping sleepwalking paths that her body traced while her mind hovered above like a lantern. [131]  
Each night she rose from the hollow she had scooped in the sand, eyes open yet dreaming, and walked until the walls narrowed to the width of a heartbeat, then widened again into chambers where pictographs of boats and wings flaked like old paint. [158]  
The storybook illustration plate grew warm against her skin whenever she crossed a threshold where the carvings spoke of reversal: a phoenix diving into ash, a seed sprouting downward into sky. [181]  
On the seventh night, she found a corridor that spiraled inward like a nautilus, its floor littered with shards of earlier pilgrims’ offerings—buttons, bones, and a single silver thimble engraved with the word “remember.” [206]  
She placed the plate at the center of the spiral, and the moonlight struck the illustration so that the painted child’s eyes opened, reflecting the canyon’s red glow with hauntingly optimistic clarity. [229]  
The walls answered by shifting, grains of sandstone rustling aside to reveal a hidden seam where a tapestry had once been anchored; only a fringe of violet thread remained, the exact shade of the orchids that grew in the wharf’s salt cracks. [256]  
Lira understood then that the labyrinth itself was a loom, its corridors warp and weft, and her sleepwalking paths were the shuttle carrying the weft of her intent. [276]  
She began to sing, a low chant taught by the tide, and the sound braided with the wind until the canyon exhaled a fine red dust that settled onto the illustration plate, turning the child’s paper boat into a vessel of living stone. [301]  
Night after night she returned, each time adding another layer to the invisible tapestry: a knot of grief for the drowned city, a strand of hope for the children who would one day sail again, a bead of reverence for the broken precedents that had made space for new stories. [330]  
The labyrinth responded by softening; sharp corners rounded, dead ends looped back into the spiral, and the air thickened with the perfume of orchids blooming out of season. [352]  
On the fourteenth night, Lira did not wake at the edge of the tide pools; instead, she walked the entire labyrinth in one seamless dream, her feet never stumbling, her hands outstretched as if gathering threads from the stars themselves. [378]  
When she reached the spiral’s center, the illustration plate had vanished, replaced by a small stone boat cradling a single orchid seed, its surface etched with the same child’s face now smiling in relief rather than fear. [403]  
She lifted the boat, felt its weight like a finished tapestry, and knew the path from ruin to reverence had been carved not by chiseling stone but by sewing memory into motion, by trusting the broken precedents to guide her beyond their own endings. [432]  
The canyon walls began to close gently behind her, not in threat but in completion, sealing the labyrinth like a locket around the seed. [450]  
Lira walked back toward the wharf as dawn bled orchid pink across the horizon, the stone boat tucked inside her coat, her stride no longer that of a sleepwalker but of a weaver who had learned to keep both eyes open while dreaming. [476]  
Behind her, the red canyon shimmered, and for the first time in centuries, the sound of water returned—not the ocean’s roar but the quiet trickle of a tide pool refilling, carrying with it the promise that every unraveling can become a reweaving if one dares to follow the thread through the dark. [512]  
She reached the wharf at sunrise, laid the stone boat on the warped planks, and planted the orchid seed in a
