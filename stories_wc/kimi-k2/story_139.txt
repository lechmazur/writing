<story>
In the heartbeat after a dream returns, Brother Halden wakes inside the swaying gondola, the creased shipping label still clenched in his fist like a prayer that missed its destination. <words>31</words>
The label is visually unappealing—faded ink, torn edges, a barcode that refuses to scan—yet it bears the monastery crest and the date his twin, Rowan, vanished while carrying this very crate of antique flutes. <words>42</words>
Below, the mountain valleys yawn silver and violet, and the gondola hums with cautious enchantment, as though the cables themselves remember every betrayal they have ferried across the peaks. <words>55</words>
Halden is a stubborn monk; he has walked barefoot through snow to prove discipline, and now he refuses to let the dream dissolve until he understands why Rowan’s reflection keeps smirking from the gondola’s dark window. <words>70</words>
He unlatches the crate, lifts out the oldest flute—blackened boxwood scarred by centuries—and studies the tooth marks along its lip plate, tiny crescents that catch the moon like runes. <words>85</words>
Rowan once bit instruments when frustrated; Halden maps the spacing of the grooves, measuring against his own teeth, and realizes the pattern is a cipher spelling the word “avenge.” <words>100</words>
Harvesting the past is forbidden art, yet Halden steadies his breath, lets the gondola’s rhythm become a chant, and draws memories from the wood: a night Rowan played this flute to summon storms, then leapt from the cabin, laughing that the Order would never cage him again. <words>120</words>
The memories reveal Rowan’s plan—he faked his death, stole the monastery’s storm-calling relics, and intends to sell them at the valley market at dawn. <words>135</words>
Halden’s dark reflection in the glass grins wider, mirroring Rowan’s triumph, and the monk understands his true motive: to outsmart your own dark reflection is to rewrite the story before it writes you. <words>150</words>
He presses the shipping label over the flute’s mouth, aligning barcode with bite marks; the ink flares, and the gondola lurches as if caught in an invisible updraft. <words>165</words>
Wind howls through the flute without being played, weaving a counter-melody that coils around the cables, slowing the cabin to a trembling halt mid-span. <words>180</words>
Rowan’s reflection steps out of the glass, solidifying into flesh, eyes bright with stolen tempest. <words>195</words>
“You came to stop me,” Rowan says, voice echoing like thunder in a jar. <words>205</words>
“I came to finish what you started,” Halden replies, raising the flute like a dagger of sound. <words>218</words>
He blows a single, precise note shaped by the tooth-mark cipher; the storm inside Rowan reverses, sucking the stolen winds back into the instrument. <words>233</words>
Rowan staggers, shrinking, until he is only a silhouette pressed flat against the shipping label, which reseals itself, now addressed to the monastery archives. <words>248</words>
The gondola resumes its glide, mountains bowing under first light, and Halden tucks the labeled flute beneath his robe, feeling neither victory nor loss, only the cautious enchantment of a future he can still choose. <words>265</words>
