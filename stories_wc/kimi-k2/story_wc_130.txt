The cavern orchard had grown silent beneath the moon, its stalactite-fed roots no longer whispering to the fruit. [21]
A secretive conjurer named Lira stepped between the petrified trunks, her lantern trembling like a guilty thought. [34]
In her pocket rested the taxidermist's glass eye pair, cool spheres that once watched over stuffed foxes and owls in a shuttered shop aboveground. [52]
She had stolen them at dusk, believing lenses that had studied death might teach her the mathematics of emotion. [69]
Tonight the orchard was a hushed auditorium of loss; every branch held a question she could not phrase. [83]
Ambiguous loss, the scholars called it—grief without a corpse, longing without coordinates. [96]
Lira’s sister had vanished into a mirror three winters ago, leaving only a reflection that refused to age. [110]
The conjurer’s hope was gently inventive: if she could measure the curvature of sorrow, she might reverse its equation. [126]
She knelt by the oldest tree, a calcified peach whose stone heart had cracked open like a geode. [140]
From her satchel she drew chalk, compass, and the glass eyes, laying them on a mosaic stepping stone chipped by centuries of dripping water. [158]
The patterns on the stone resembled wings, or perhaps parentheses enclosing an unsolved sum. [171]
Lira pressed the left eye into the center of one wing, the right into the other, letting their gaze dovetail across the fissures. [187]
Light from her lantern refracted through the glass, projecting twin crescents onto the cavern roof like parentheses around the moon. [203]
She whispered prime numbers, then the names of every fruit she and her sister had shared, weaving them into a sequence that felt almost like breathing. [221]
The stalactites answered with a single drop that landed precisely between the eyes, a decimal point of water. [235]
Lira felt the orchard exhale. [239]
Memories surfaced: her sister laughing at the taxidermist’s shop, daring Lira to try on the glass eyes, claiming they let you see the sadness inside birds. [258]
She had refused then, afraid of what might look back. [267]
Now she leaned closer, watching the droplet tremble on the mosaic, its surface holding a miniature moon and two reflected girls. [283]
The image wavered, and for a heartbeat the sister’s older face appeared, lips moving without sound. [296]
Lira’s throat tightened with buried optimism; perhaps the equation was not to solve loss but to keep it balanced. [311]
She traced the chipped patterns with her fingertip, feeling how each fracture guided the next, a narrative of breakage that still held together. [328]
The glass eyes began to warm, as if the remembered gaze inside them stirred. [338]
A low hum rose from the roots, the orchard remembering it was once alive. [349]
Petals of mineral salt drifted down, tasting of tears and iron. [358]
Lira understood: emotion could not be extracted like a fossil; it had to be walked through, step by numbered step. [374]
She lifted the eyes, cradling them like twin moons, and set them into the hollow sockets of the calcified peach. [389]
The tree shuddered; a single drop of sap, clear as regret, slid from its bark and landed on the mosaic. [403]
Where it struck, a tiny fern unfurled, green against the stone’s gray algebra. [414]
Lira smiled, the expression unfamiliar but not unwelcome. [424]
She began to walk the orchard’s spiral path, counting her breaths, letting each footfall dovetail with the next, following the chipped patterns wherever they led. [443]
Behind her, the peach tree’s new leaves rustled, sounding almost like a name. [455]
She did not turn back; ambiguous loss, she now knew, was a corridor rather than a wall. [468]
The glass eyes remained in the tree, watching over the cavern’s slow return to song. [481]
Above, the moon moved fractionally, a silent variable in the equation of night. [494]
Lira’s lantern dimmed, but she no longer needed its circle of light; the path glowed faintly from within, each step a solved note in an unfinished melody. [515]
She thought of her sister’s reflection, forever fourteen, and felt the ache soften into accompaniment rather than absence. [531]
At the orchard’s edge she paused, pressing her palm to the damp stone wall. [543]
Water sang down, drop by drop, teaching the patience of stalactites. [554]
She whispered, “I’ll keep the parentheses open,” and stepped into the tunnel beyond. [567]
