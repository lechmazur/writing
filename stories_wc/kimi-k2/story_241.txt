<story>
The floating cloud cafe drifted above the darkened plains, its brass rails humming with the last stored sunlight, when the unexplained blackout struck. <words>25</words>
Soft-voiced guide Lira pressed her palm to the embroidered vest she wore, feeling the stitched constellations pulse like tiny hearts against her ribs. <words>42</words>
Every lantern in the gondola died at once, leaving only the blissful agony of starlight and the memory of warmth. <words>57</words>
Below, the silent plains screamed without sound, a constantly rare vibration that only certain hearts could harness. <words>74</words>
Lira had come here with quiet partnerships in mind: one with the boy who brewed cloud-berry tea, one with the wind that carried lost music, and one with the darkness itself. <words>96</words>
Tonight she would need all three, because the blackout had severed the sky-rails and the cafe was drifting toward the storm wall. <words>115</words>
She moved between tables with the zeal of someone who has rehearsed catastrophe into grace, touching each sleeve, whispering coordinates. <words>135</words>
The tea-boy, Milo, met her at the service hatch wearing his own embroidered vest, twin to hers, sewn from the same bolt of sky-silk. <words>156</words>
Together they had discovered that when two such vests touched, the scream of the plains became audible, a silver thread they could weave into power. <words>178</words>
But the thread required motion, and the usual midnight train that towed the cafe had vanished into the dark. <words>197</words>
"We're taking a different train than usual," Lira murmured, guiding Milo to the emergency glider folded like a paper swan on the observation deck. <words>220</words>
The glider's wings were stitched with the same constellations; when they snapped open, the embroidered threads caught starlight and bled it into the engines. <words>246</words>
As they launched, the cafe lurched, spilling cups and saucers into the night like startled birds. <words>264</words>
Lira and Milo clasped hands, vest to vest, letting the scream of the silent plains rise through their joined sleeves and into the glider's heart. <words>289</words>
The sound was unbearably beautiful, a blissful agony that tasted of lightning and lullabies. <words>307</words>
It powered their descent toward the forgotten rail spur where the midnight train waited, its headlamp cracked but willing. <words>329</words>
They landed with the softness of snow, the glider folding itself back into a swan that tucked its head beneath a wing. <words>351</words>
The train driver, an old woman whose voice had been stolen by wind, nodded once and opened the furnace door. <words>373</words>
Lira fed the scream into the fire; Milo fed the memory of warmth. <words>388</words>
The engine woke, a quiet partnership of sound and silence, and the floating cloud cafe began its slow tow home. <words>411</words>
Above them, the blackout still reigned, but inside every cup refilled itself, and the constellations on their vests burned steady, constantly rare, guiding the dark with borrowed light. <words>446</words>
