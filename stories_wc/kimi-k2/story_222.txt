In the crystalline foyer of the extraterrestrial embassy, where light bent like polite questions, the secretive conjurer Arin adjusted the threadbare washcloth tucked inside his sleeve. <words>25</words>
Before the first dance begins, he reminded himself, studying the swirl of dignitaries whose gowns shimmered like captive nebulae. <words>37</words>
He was philosophically shallow, a man who quoted sunrises instead of understanding them, yet he believed he could tame the power of nature itself if only he spoke its name with enough conviction. <words>57</words>
Tonight’s conviction arrived in the form of an heirloom piece of jewelry—a tarnished locket dangling from the wrist of Ambassador Selu, whose people drank starlight to remember their dead. <words>79</words>
Arin brushed past her, letting the washcloth graze the locket; the cloth, once his mother’s, carried microscopic seeds of Earth moss she had cultivated to heal refugees after the Martian drought. <words>104</words>
The contact sparked a story only the moss remembered: roots threading through asteroid soil, whispering that compassion, like mycelium, grows in hidden layers beneath cruelty’s crust. <words>129</words>
Selu’s pupils dilated, tasting the memory; her species prized layered kindness as currency more stable than any treaty. <words>147</words>
Arin bowed, calculated dreams flickering behind his courteous smile, and offered to demonstrate a “harmless” conjuration before the orchestra struck its opening chord. <words>169</words>
He led her to the embassy’s bio-dome balcony, where Earth vines had been quarantined for fear they might seduce the moon-rooted gardens below. <words>193</words>
With theatrical grace he unfolded the washcloth, revealing the faint green constellation of dormant spores. <words>212</words>
“Watch,” he whispered, though his shallow philosophy could not grasp that watching is a form of love. <words>232</words>
He breathed across the cloth; the spores awakened, weaving luminous filaments that spelled forgotten names of children Selu had failed to save during the Plague of Falling Suns. <words>261</words>
Tears, salty as oceans, slipped from her tri-lidded eyes; each tear fed the moss, which thickened into a soft bridge arching toward the night sky. <words>285</words>
Arin’s motivation sharpened: if he could harness this living bridge, he could tether fleeing comets, leash solar storms, make nature his obedient pet. <words>311</words>
Yet the moss, older than his greed, refused command; instead it wrapped gentle tendrils around Selu’s trembling fingers, offering not domination but partnership. <words>339</words>
In that moment Arin felt the first layer of compassion press against his heart like warm rain on drought-cracked stone. <words>363</words>
He saw how shallow his earlier dreams had been, mere reflections of power rather than its source. <words>385</words>
The orchestra began its opening notes; beneath them, the moss released a fragrance of pine and apology. <words>406</words>
Arin tucked the now-verdant washcloth back into his sleeve, not as a tool but as a vow, and stepped aside so Selu could be the first to cross the bridge of living light. <words>439</words>
Together, before the first dance begins, they walked above the embassy’s gardens, two species learning that to tame is to listen, and to harness nature is to be harnessed by its mercy. <words>490</words>
