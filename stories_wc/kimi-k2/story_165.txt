<story>
At the break of a brittle branch in a silent forest, the gentle conjurer Elara slipped through the mossy gate that led to the underground city of the dwarves. <words>29</words>
She carried a stained glass butterfly wrapped in velvet, its wings fractured into seven shards that once spelled justice in the forgotten garden above. <words>25</words>
The dwarves had sealed that garden after the Trial of Echoes, when reversed messages whispered through crystal roots and turned every promise into betrayal. <words>23</words>
Elara’s heart beat with joyful terror, for she alone remembered the inscrutably obvious truth: the garden had not died; it had been disassembled and hidden in plain sight. <words>27</words>
Down spiraling obsidian stairs she descended, past forges that sang like cicadas and waterfalls of molten gold that lit the cavern walls with trembling rainbows. <words>25</words>
At the seventh landing she met Thimbur, the archivist whose beard was braided with tiny mirrors; he bowed, recognizing the velvet bundle. <words>22</words>
“To reassemble the butterfly is to reopen the trial,” he warned, eyes flicking to the shards that glimmered like captive stars. <words>21</words>
Elara smiled, gentle yet unyielding, and spoke the first reversed message: “ecitsuj si tsriF,” letting the syllables roll backward until the cavern air shimmered and a hidden door sighed open. <words>30</words>
Beyond the door lay the garden’s ghost: petrified roses, fountains of frozen mercury, and seven pedestals shaped like dwarven hearts. <words>21</words>
On each pedestal waited a fragment of memory—an echo of laughter, a drop of blood, a judge’s tear—each humming the same reversed lullaby. <words>25</words>
With trembling fingers Elara lifted the shards, fitting them into the butterfly’s frame; every click sounded like a verdict overturned. <words>23</words>
The final piece slid home, and the stained glass butterfly quivered, wings spreading into living light that painted the cavern ceiling with scenes of the wrongful exile. <words>27</words>
Dwarven elders emerged from shadow, faces carved by guilt; the joyful terror in Elara’s chest burst into song as the garden stirred, roots cracking stone, petals unfurling like pardons. <words>30</words>
Reversed messages now flowed forward, revealing the name of the true traitor who had framed the gardeners and stolen their songs. <words>22</words>
Justice, bright as sunrise, flooded the underground city; the gentle conjurer wept as roses climbed the forges and butterflies of every hue rose from the earth. <words>26</words>
Together, dwarves and conjurer tended the reborn garden, its fragrance a promise that nothing broken need remain so, and above them the brittle branch in the silent forest burst into leaf, echoing their laughter. <words>37</words>
