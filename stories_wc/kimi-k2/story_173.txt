<story>
The wandering orchardist drifted through the drowned marble corridors of the forgotten underwater city hall, pockets heavy with a collection of dried leaves that once rustled above trade roads now buried beneath leagues of silt and silence. <words>38</words>
Each brittle leaf was a map, veins inked by seasons he had walked between worlds, and he carried them like promises to the kitchen table wisdom he hoped still waited in the council chamber where merchants once bargained futures. <words>37</words>
Salt water pressed against his throat like old regret, yet the trustworthy unique flavor of apple memory kept him breathing, kept him moving through the green gloom toward the round oak table he had seen only in dreams cast across the multiverse. <words>36</words>
He needed to reclaim the routes before the last orchard drowned, before every seed forgot the taste of earth; the phantom hand of his long-dead mentor had touched his shoulder in seventeen different timelines, guiding him here, to this single drowned moment. <words>40</words>
At the table, chairs floated like ghosts of negotiation, and he spread the leaves in a spiral, their edges trembling in the current, each one a bittersweet grit of color against the pale stone. <words>31</words>
The phantom hand brushed his again—cold, familiar, certain—and where it passed, the leaves unfolded into living roads, silver roots threading through water, showing paths that crossed deserts of ash, moons of glass, markets where apples were currency and sorrow. <words>38</words>
He traced them with a finger calloused from ten thousand grafts, feeling the pull of orchards he would never see again, orchards he would plant again in other skins, other skies. <words>29</words>
A council ledger drifted past, pages open to debts unpaid, and he caught it, reading names that echoed across realities: traders who bargained futures for fruit, lovers who traded futures for farewell. <words>30</words>
Kitchen table wisdom, his mentor had said, is knowing which debts to honor and which to let dissolve like sugar in rain; the orchardist tasted salt and apple on his tongue and chose. <words>30</words>
He pressed the phantom hand to the final leaf, the one that led home, and felt the city hall shudder as timelines collapsed into a single ripe moment. <words>27</words>
Water receded, not drained but remembered away, and the table stood dry beneath a ceiling of stars that were not stars but other city halls, other orchards, other selves watching. <words>30</words>
The routes were mapped now, inked in leaf and memory, and he gathered them back into his coat, knowing the next step would take him through seventeen doors at once, each opening onto a different scent of blossom and loss. <words>37</words>
Before he left, he set one last seed on the table, a small white promise, and whispered the mentor’s name into the hush; somewhere, in another hall, another orchardist would find it and begin again. <words>34</words>
The phantom hand faded, but the warmth lingered, and the orchardist walked on, carrying the bittersweet grit of every future he would both lose and plant. <words>27</words>
