The gloom-hill coachman arrived at the blooming jetty at twilight, the planks beneath his boots still warm from the day’s last sun. [23]
Behind him, the reef had died weeks ago, its coral bones now pale and silent beneath the slack tide. [34]
He carried a collection of dried seed pods in a leather pouch slung across his chest, each pod rattling like a tiny coffin. [50]
The coachman spoke dead languages fluently, murmuring in Etruscan to the wind and in Akkadian to the gulls overhead. [68]
He had come to fertilize the battlefield that stretched beyond the jetty, where cannon scars still pocked the earth like open mouths. [85]
By understanding bird calls, he had learned from a tern that the soil here was poisoned with iron and grief. [101]
The submerged concord between land and sea had broken when the reef died, and now nothing grew except saltweed and sorrow. [119]
He knelt, cracked a pod between his palms, and let the seeds fall into a crater left by a mortar shell. [135]
The seeds were from a garden his mother had kept before the war, before the hill where he now drove the hearse-coach was named for gloom. [155]
He whispered to them in Hittite, a lullaby for the unborn, and the gulls answered in their own tongue, telling him where the soil was softest. [175]
Each evening since the reef’s death, he returned, sowing and chanting, letting the narrow vastness of the place settle into his lungs. [194]
The battlefield felt both small and endless, a strip of land caught between the jetty’s flowers and the sea’s blank horizon. [213]
He had once driven soldiers here, their laughter loud in the coach, their uniforms bright as poppies. [228]
Now he drove only silence, and the poppies he planted were the color of dried blood. [241]
One night, a heron landed beside him, its call a question in the grammar of wings. [254]
He replied in the same tongue, asking if the earth was ready. [264]
The heron dipped its beak into a puddle of rainwater and drew a circle, which the coachman took for yes. [278]
He scattered the last of the pods along the circle’s edge, then pressed each seed down with a thumbprint of ash from his mother’s old stove. [298]
The ash carried her voice, a lullaby in a language no one else remembered. [311]
By morning, green shoots had risen, thin as bayonet blades but soft, their leaves trembling like new flags. [327]
The gulls returned, not to scavenge but to perch among the stems, singing directions for rain. [340]
The coachman listened, translating their cries into watering patterns, into shade and sun. [352]
He slept on the jetty, curled beneath the blooming oleanders, dreaming of the reef as it once was—alive, a city of color beneath the waves. [372]
In his dream, the coral sang in Latin, a requiem for the drowned, and the seeds answered in Greek, promising return. [389]
When he woke, the battlefield was no longer a scar but a beginning. [400]
Flowers had opened overnight, their petals the same bruised purple as the sky before a storm. [414]
The heron stood among them, still as a monument, its reflection doubled in a pool of rainwater. [428]
The coachman approached, speaking in the language of the dead, thanking the bird for its guidance. [442]
The heron lifted one foot, revealing a single seed pod it had carried from the reef’s grave. [456]
He took it gently, knowing it was the last, the one that would bind the submerged concord again. [470]
He planted it at the jetty’s edge, where the tide could reach it, where the flowers could drink salt and remember. [486]
Then he waited, listening to the gulls, to the wind, to the heartbeat of the earth beneath the battlefield. [500]
Slowly, the tide rose, carrying with it the scent of coral and the sound of forgotten songs. [513]
The flowers leaned toward the water, their roots drinking deep, their colors shifting from purple to gold. [527]
The coachman smiled, the first in years, and spoke to the garden in every dead language he knew, a chorus of gratitude. [545]
The heron took flight, its wings beating the air like a blessing. [555]
Behind it, the battlefield bloomed, a garden reclaiming what war had taken, the narrow vastness of loss now filled with life. [573]
The gloom-hill coachman stayed until the last light faded, until the flowers glowed
