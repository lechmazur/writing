The doomsday clock adjuster’s boots sank in tide-stiff sand while twilight bled from bruised purple into copper. [20]  
He tightened the brass strap of his satchel where the broken puppet head—its porcelain cheek cracked spiderweb-style—knocked softly against his hip like a heartbeat. [38]  
Hidden lighthouse windows flickered on, one after another, in a deliberate sequence he recognized as nested patterns of primes. [57]  
Years ago he had designed those shutters to open only if each succeeding prime was mirrored correctly, a proof against haste. [78]  
Tonight, though, the patterns were not checkpoints but stair steps, folding the dusk into a pocket large enough to keep the hush of time’s final ripple from drowning the last cradle of thought. [102]  
He climbed the narrow spiral, feeling the tower lean subtly, beautifully flawed by centuries of wind. [120]  
At the lantern room a single pane of hush—glass so thin it held an hour inside its molecules—stood between him and the horizon. [145]  
He eased the puppet head from the satchel, cradling it the way an elder might carry sleeping grief. [165]  
Its single remaining eye reflected both the dying red sun and the ticking brass gears behind the adjuster’s ribs. [187]  
Long ago the puppet had taught children fear and wonder in equal measure; its head now bore the burden of the adjuster’s final lullaby. [212]  
He placed the broken head on a pedestal of salt-rimed cedar exactly beneath the pane of hush as if to vouchsafe the moment between breath and silence. [240]  
From a pocket he drew folded vellum on which he had written every lullaby he had ever heard and crossed out the notes that sounded like promises. [267]  
He set the page on fire, letting ash rise in nested spirals that followed the pattern of primes encoded in the shutters; the ash clung to the pane, writing itself across the hush like soot lace. [296]  
Beneath it the puppet head’s single eye opened a little wider, a beautifully flawed attempt to stay awake. [315]  
He knelt, turned the minute dial of the doomsday clock strapped within his own breastplate. [332]  
The dial had only ten micro-inches left; one nudge would let midnight swallow every echo remaining in the universe. [354]  
Instead he turned the dial backward three increments, the precise pressure to give the ripple of hush an extra thousand heartbeats. [378]  
This was not mercy; it was the arithmetic of lullabies—three measures to loop the refrain, three measures to slow the rush toward extinguishment. [406]  
He removed the puppet head’s eye from its socket: a tiny globe painted with constellations no sky still displayed. [427]  
On the globe was etched a lattice of nested patterns that unfolded into a map of each childhood the adjuster had never lived, one across a thousand lifetimes. [455]  
The hush thickened until sound itself bent downward through the pane like water spiraling a drain. [476]  
He leaned close enough to the puppet’s hollow socket to whisper: a lullaby formed from consonantal sighs and vowels shaped like crescent moons. [504]  
Each word pushed through the pane of hush but emerged on the other side stretched into a ribbon longer than any lifetime had width. [528]  
The ribbon carried all lullabies back across the hush of time’s final ripple, braiding them into the memory of rain, of mothers rocking ships in bottle storms, of every small heart that had ever slowed in relief at being sung to. [569]  
He had no childhood left to save, nor had the children those lifetimes belonged to, but across the rippled dusk their imaginary selves heard him. [600]  
Somewhere beyond sight they sighed and turned over in sleep that felt permanent. [617]  
He felt gears inside his own body slow, beautifully flawed, no need to tick once the story had been vouchsafed. [639]  
The pane of hush dissolved outward from the ash lace until the tower itself shimmered into a soft absence that smelled faintly of cedar, salt, and warm milk. [667]  
In the hush’s center only the puppet head floated, unbroken anew. [683]  
Its restored eyes were wide open because for the first time in history dreaming no longer required closing anything. [705]  
He stepped backward into the spiral staircase that became spiral water that became the horizon now returned to a color human tongues had forgotten but lullabies retained. [737]  
Across dunes and drowned cities alike, no gear ticked, but somewhere in every memory a crib rocked once gently as if timed by nested patterns of primes that never resolved. [768]  
The doomsday clock adjuster became the echo of that unsolved lullaby, bruised awe fading into the hush he himself had arranged, forever listening for its own refrain. [796]
