The reclaimed orchard farmland inside the toppled skyscraper smelled of bruised apples and wet concrete when the bluffing swindler, energetically lethargic from three sleepless cons, shuffled between dwarf peach trees. <words>34</words>
He carried a blank price tag pinched between two fingers like a cigarette, rehearsing the lie he would pin on tomorrow's victims. <words>47</words>
Invisible allies—whispers of former tenants whose cubicles once grew here—rustled the leaves, urging him toward the center where a single terminal still blinked. <words>61</words>
At the instant the frozen computer finally restarted, a dropped book—a cracked manual titled "Honest Work"—thumped against his boot, and the meet-cute began. <words>77</words>
A woman in coveralls stained with honest soil knelt to retrieve it, her eyes sharp enough to magnetize guilt from iron hearts. <words>90</words>
She recognized the swindler's face from wanted posters taped to elevator shafts and asked, gentle harshness in her voice, whether he planned to sell the orchard's fruit or its memory. <words>106</words>
He flashed the blank price tag, claiming the cost was still being calculated by market forces beyond them both, but the invisible allies hissed that the only market here was conscience. <words>123</words>
She invited him to sit on a fallen I-beam turned garden bench, and the energetically lethargic swindler found himself too tired to invent another story, so he listened. <words>138</words>
She spoke of tenants who once traded stocks above these roots, of how the building toppled not from quake but from the weight of paper promises, and how the orchard was planted to bury those lies in something living. <words>158</words>
The computer chimed; a spreadsheet of vanished pensions scrolled across the cracked screen, each name a ghost tugging at the swindler's sleeve. <words>173</words>
He felt the invisible allies crowd closer, their breath cool against his neck, and understood they wanted him to bare a truth no one dares to handle: that he had sold those same pensions, one smiling lie at a time. <words>193</words>
His fingers trembled; the blank price tag fluttered like a white flag. <words>202</words>
He told her everything—the aliases, the offshore accounts, the retirees who now picked through these orchards for lunch. <words>216</words>
She did not strike him; instead she pressed the dropped book into his hands and said the orchard needed a keeper who knew the exact weight of shame. <words>232</words>
The swindler, still energetically lethargic yet somehow lighter, nailed the blank price tag to the terminal screen, a receipt for a debt that could never be repaid, only tended. <words>250</words>
Around them the invisible allies sighed, leaves applauding, as the orchard accepted another fallen thing back into its slow, stubborn growth. <words>267</words>
