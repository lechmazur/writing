The alchemist’s market strung high above city rooftops swayed like a lantern in the wind, its stalls of brass and silk suspended by chains older than any living memory. [34]  
Between childhood and now, I have walked these catwalks as a between-worlds translator, ferrying meanings too delicate for ordinary tongues. [50]  
My satchel holds a lighthouse lens fragment, thumb-smooth, elusively tangible; when moonlight strikes it, the glass remembers every ship it ever warned. [70]  
Tonight the fragment pulses, urging me toward a canvas stall where forgotten histories hang like drying herbs. [83]  
The painter, veiled in indigo, greets me with silence and offers a small square of storm-blue pigment. [96]  
I unfasten the cloth, revealing a scene of children launching paper boats into gutters that once were rivers. [110]  
Hidden details in paintings are my anchors of intuition; here, a single white thread stitched into a sail forms the outline of the lost lighthouse whose lens I carry. [130]  
The thread tugs at memory, and suddenly I am seven again, watching my grandmother fold paper boats while she told me stories of the light that kept sailors from the rocks. [152]  
She said the light spoke in colors no chart could name, and only those who listened with their eyes could translate its warnings. [170]  
Now the market lanterns dim, and the canvas begins to glow, the painted water rippling outward until the gutter becomes a living tide. [187]  
I press the fragment to the surface; glass meets pigment, and the scene blooms into three dimensions. [200]  
The children turn, their faces familiar—myself, my sister, the neighbor who vanished one foggy dawn. [214]  
They beckon, and I step through the frame, the catwalks dissolving behind me into salt wind. [226]  
We stand on the original lighthouse parapet, its beacon shattered but still humming with residual color. [239]  
My sister, unchanged by years, hands me a folded boat made from the same indigo cloth that wrapped the pigment. [253]  
She whispers that histories are not chains but sails; to honor them is to let them carry us forward, not hold us back. [271]  
The fragment flares, projecting prisms across the parapet, each hue a word in the language of almost-lost things. [286]  
I translate aloud: the red of rusted hulls, the green of sea glass, the violet of dusk before electricity. [301]  
The colors braid into a rope that lashes the lighthouse to the sky, anchoring it in the eternal instant between collapse and continuity. [318]  
The children climb the rope, ascending into the prism until only their laughter remains, echoing like gulls. [331]  
I remain, holding the fragment now warm as skin, aware that my role is not to follow but to carry their story back. [347]  
The scene folds again, canvas becoming cloth, parapet becoming catwalk, and I am once more in the alchemist’s market. [363]  
The painter nods, takes the indigo boat, and pins it beside the canvas where it flutters like a second heart. [376]  
She writes a price in salt: “One memory, truthfully told.” [386]  
I give her the moment my grandmother’s hands trembled folding the last boat before the lighthouse went dark. [400]  
Salt dissolves into ink, and the painting is complete, its gutter-river now carrying tiny white sails toward an unseen sea. [416]  
I walk the swaying aisles, the fragment quiet against my palm, its elusively tangible weight reminding me that translation is never finished. [434]  
Stallholders offer vials of distilled thunder, but I seek only the next canvas, the next hidden thread. [448]  
A boy with soot-streaked cheeks tugs my sleeve and shows me a miniature lighthouse carved from candle wax. [463]  
Inside, a fleck of mirror catches the moon; when I tilt it, the reflection reveals rooftops I have not yet walked. [478]  
I understand then that the market itself is an anchor, a place where every overlooked history waits for a translator willing to unfasten its frame. [498]  
I buy the wax lighthouse with a promise to return, and the boy smiles, already older than he was a moment ago. [513]  
Time here is not linear but tidal, and I ride its surge back toward the catwalk’s edge where the city below glitters like scattered glass. [530]  
I raise the fragment to the sky; moonlight splits into the colors I named, painting the clouds with remembered warnings. [546]  
Somewhere below, a ship changes course, its captain sensing a
