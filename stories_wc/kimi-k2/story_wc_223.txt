The interregnum began the night the palace clocks stopped, and with them the heartbeat of the city. [21]
In the whispering gallery beneath the abandoned throne room, Mara pressed her cheek to the cool marble wall and listened to the hush that had replaced the sovereign’s pulse. [38]
She was a crisis actor no longer needed for drills, because the real crisis had arrived and swallowed the script. [55]
Yet she had survived the fire that erased the royal line, and the smoke still clung to her hair like a reluctant crown. [74]
On the cracked alabaster floor lay a chessboard missing all the pawns, its squares glowing faintly as though remembering battles that no longer mattered. [96]
Mara knelt, fingers tracing the absence where foot soldiers should have stood, and felt the board tug at memory the way tide pulls driftwood. [117]
She had come to the gallery to unbind herself from the roles she had rehearsed—victim, witness, mourner—each mask now too tight. [137]
The nomadic penumbra of the interregnum drifted through the corridors, a traveling shadow that belonged to no ruler and therefore to everyone. [158]
Mara stepped into that penumbra, letting it coat her like a second skin, and began to walk. [172]
Her soles described a pattern across the squares: left two, forward one, pause, right three—spelling, in the old cipher of street urchins, the word REMEMBER. [197]
The gallery answered, stone lips murmuring the syllables back, multiplying them into a choir of luminous absence. [214]
She walked again, this time tracing FORGIVE, and the walls softened, releasing motes of light that drifted upward like startled fireflies. [234]
Between words she studied the chessboard, noting how the remaining pieces—rooks, bishops, knights, royalty—stood frozen in mid-breath, unable to advance without their smallest warriors. [259]
Mara understood the metaphor: history forgets the pawns first, yet every king’s fall begins with their disappearance. [276]
She resolved to become the historian of small gestures, the archivist of glances, sighs, and half-finished sentences that would otherwise vanish with the regime. [297]
To do so she had to be benevolently ruthless, willing to excise her own nostalgia the way a surgeon removes proud flesh so the wound can heal. [318]
She walked a third pattern—OBSERVE—her feet kissing stone, her shadow merging with the nomadic penumbra until she could no longer tell where she ended and the interregnum began. [344]
The gallery approved; the whispers braided themselves into a single clear voice that said, “Begin.” [359]
Mara lifted the chessboard, cradling it like a wounded bird, and carried it to the center of the room. [375]
One by one she tipped the remaining pieces onto the floor, listening to the clack of ivory on marble, each sound a syllable in the elegy she was composing. [396]
Then she arranged the fallen rooks and bishops into a circle around the empty squares where pawns had been, creating a silent parliament of the overlooked. [418]
She stepped inside the circle and resumed walking, spelling smaller words now: HAND, TEARDROP, BREADCRUMB. [436]
With every circuit the light in the gallery grew steadier, as though the stones themselves were learning to see. [453]
Mara felt the benevolent ruthlessness take root: she would not flinch from painful truths, nor would she spare herself the duty of recording them. [473]
Hours passed, or perhaps minutes; time had loosened its corset during the interregnum. [488]
When her legs trembled, she sat cross-legged within the circle and began to speak aloud the gestures she had cataloged during the fire. [507]
The mother who covered her child’s mouth with a silk scarf to keep out the smoke. [523]
The guard who let an old man pass, breaking protocol because the man carried a cage of finches. [541]
The baker who flung loaves through broken windows even as his shop burned. [556]
The gallery repeated each story back to her, the whispers layering until the air shimmered with remembered kindness. [573]
Mara realized the chessboard was no longer empty; the squares now held faint impressions of footprints, the ghost-pawns returned through narrative. [593]
She stood, wiped soot from her palms, and walked one final pattern: STAY. [605]
The nomadic penumbra settled around her shoulders like a cloak, and the whispering gallery fell silent, its task complete. [622]
Mara remained inside the circle, historian of small gestures, guardian of luminous absence, ready to greet whatever dawn
