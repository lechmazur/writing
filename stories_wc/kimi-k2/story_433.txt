Amid snow days that erased the city's edges, the hardheaded traveler pushed open the ephemeral art gallery, its walls flickering between watercolor and frost. <words>25</words>
She carried a secret book safe beneath her coat, its spine disguised as a forgotten field guide, pages hollowed to cradle the scraps of prophecy she had torn from a library's corner. <words>37</words>
Each scrap whispered of power bought with pieces of the soul, and she had paid already—she was wholeheartedly broken, wrists scarred by bargains that never quite healed. <words>49</words>
The gallery's current exhibit was titled "The Price of Power"; canvases melted and re-formed, showing mountains bleeding gold and rivers running black with ink. <words>61</words>
She moved through the struggle of images, boots crunching on salt meant to mimic snow, searching for the one painting rumored to open onto real wilderness. <words>73</words>
A guard with eyes like shuttered windows watched her, but her demure audacity carried her past him, chin lowered, gaze steady, as if she belonged among the dying landscapes. <words>85</words>
In the farthest alcove, she found it: a small canvas of a pine forest breathing steam, so alive the needles seemed to shiver. <words>95</words>
She pressed the secret book safe against the frame; the scraps inside fluttered like trapped moths, aligning with symbols painted beneath the bark. <words>106</words>
The prophecy spoke of a door that would appear only for the one who had lost enough, and she had lost everything—family, name, the ability to sleep without dreaming of debts. <words>118</words>
The canvas rippled, became gauze, then air; cold wind carrying pine and snow spilled through, kissing her cracked lips. <words>128</words>
She stepped forward, but the gallery fought back, walls folding like paper, trying to trap her in another frame. <words>138</words>
Her fingers bled as she tore at the edges, the struggle not against the art but against the memory of every choice that had led her here. <words>149</words>
The scraps of prophecy burned in the book safe, their ink bleeding into her palms, writing new lines across her skin: "Solace is not escape, but acceptance." <words>161</words>
She hesitated, understanding at last that nature's embrace would not erase her brokenness; it would only hold it gently, like snow holds a fallen bird. <words>173</words>
With a cry that was half surrender, half triumph, she crossed the threshold; the gallery sealed behind her, leaving only silence and the faint scent of turpentine on the wind. <words>185</words>
Snow welcomed her, soft as forgiveness, and she walked into the trees, the secret book safe now empty, its prophecy fulfilled not in power gained, but in the price finally paid. <words>197</words>
