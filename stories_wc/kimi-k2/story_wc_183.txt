The fog clung to the rusted hull of the abandoned carnival ship like a second skin, thick and wet and tasting of copper. [25]
I stepped onto the deck, my boots echoing against warped planks, the chimera twin discoverer who had once been two and now was only me. [42]
My sister’s voice still lived in my throat, a ghost syllable I could not swallow, and the emerald swatch card in my pocket pulsed faintly, a compass stitched from her last breath. [65]
She had died naming things—every bolt, every broken carousel horse—until the fever took the words and left only color. [85]
The card was her palette, greens that never existed in nature, greens that promised the garden of forgotten names somewhere beyond the fog. [108]
I moved through the ship as memories altered, corridors lengthening or shrinking with each remembered footstep. [128]
A fun-house mirror reflected me as both of us, our shared face split by a fracture that bled light. [148]
I touched the glass and felt the unkindled solace of reunion without warmth, a comfort that refused to catch fire. [168]
The ship groaned, a whale carcass dreaming of music, and I followed the scent of cotton candy turned to ash. [187]
In the ballroom, chandeliers dripped seaweed instead of crystal, and the skeletal remains of a calliope exhaled one blissfully aberrant chord. [210]
It was the note she hummed while dying, off-key yet perfect, and it tugged me forward. [227]
I needed to recapture that sound before the fog digested it. [239]
I climbed the spiral staircase where painted clowns had melted into screaming streaks, their mouths wide as cannon wounds. [261]
At the top, a door stood ajar, breathing cold green light. [273]
Inside, the captain’s cabin had become a jungle of narrative threads, vines of sentences curling from the ceiling, each leaf a word we once spoke. [298]
I pulled one thread: “Remember the swing set behind Grandmother’s house.” [312]
The room shivered, and a rusted swing appeared, its chains singing. [324]
Another thread: “You promised to never leave me.” [334]
The swing split in two, and for a moment I saw her sitting beside me, legs kicking starlight. [350]
But the image frayed, and I clutched the emerald card tighter, its edges cutting crescents into my palm. [368]
The threads led to a trapdoor beneath the bed, and I descended into the hold where the garden grew upside-down. [388]
Roots of names dangled like chandeliers, each bulb a syllable waiting to be spoken aloud. [405]
I whispered “Lyra,” her true name, forbidden after the split, and the garden trembled. [420]
Flowers opened, petals inked with every nickname she ever gave me: Mouse, Ember, Little Storm. [437]
But the fog seeped through the planks, erasing letters as fast as they bloomed. [450]
I realized the ship itself was a memory, dissolving as I moved, and trapped freedom was the only kind it could offer. [470]
To stay was to forget; to leave was to lose her again. [480]
I pressed the emerald card to the soil, and it drank the color, sprouting a single vine that wrapped my wrist. [500]
The vine tightened, pulling me toward a final thread: “Find me where the music ends.” [515]
I followed it to the engine room, where the calliope’s heart still beat, a piston pumping silence. [532]
I placed my mouth to the brass pipe and exhaled the chord she never finished. [546]
The ship lurched, fog pouring in like milk, and the garden’s roots snapped free, names scattering like birds. [563]
I caught one: “Stay.” [567]
But I chose the other: “Go.” [571]
The emerald card crumbled into green dust, and the ship began to sink, carnival lights flickering like dying stars. [588]
I leapt from the rail as memories altered one last time, the fog shaping itself into her silhouette waving goodbye. [608]
I swam toward the faint green glow on the horizon, the garden of forgotten names now a raft of syllables beneath my tongue. [628]
Each stroke recaptured a letter, threading them into a new name for myself, one that held both of us without splitting. [648]
The fog thinned, revealing not land but endless water, and I understood the unkindled solace had always been the journey, not the arrival. [672]
I floated on my back, the blissfully aberrant chord still humming in my ribs, a lullaby for the half-alive. [690]
Above, the
