The sapped herbalist, drained by years of coaxing flawless remedies from stubborn soil, stood in the glass-walled observatory on the ocean cliff, watching the tide erase footprints she had never meant to leave. <words>34</words>
During napping, when the building sighed like a lung and the gulls outside dreamed their shrill dreams, she studied tide patterns with fervent indifference, noting how each wave paid the price of perfection by breaking. <words>34</words>
She had come here to forget the garden where every leaf had to be symmetrical, every root unblemished, until the soil itself seemed to crouch in fear of her shears. <words>29</words>
On the workbench lay the blacksmith’s bellows she had traded for a vial of flawless tincture, its cracked leather flanks still smelling of coal and striving. <words>25</words>
She lifted it thoughtfully thoughtless, feeling the memory of fire inside the ribs, and wondered if the smith had also chased impossible heat until his arms gave out. <words>27</words>
Through the southern pane she tracked the flight path of a lone goose arrowing north against the wind, its wings ragged yet unwavering, and she felt the first loosening in her chest. <words>28</words>
The goose did not look down at the glittering observatory or the woman who measured water the way others measure sin; it simply flew, carrying absence like a lantern. <words>27</words>
She set the bellows beside the tide charts, aligning nozzle to compass rose, and imagined breathing the ocean in and out until the glass fogged with salt forgiveness. <words>25</words>
Perfection, she realized, was a bellows that never tore, a tide that never ebbed, a goose that never molted—monuments no one could cherish because they never changed. <words>28</words>
She pressed her palm to the cool wall and felt the cliff tremble with the heartbeat of the sleeping planet, a rhythm older than any flawless leaf. <words>25</words>
In the hush between gull cries and the soft snore of the building, she whispered a promise to the cracked leather: I will cherish the tear, the rust, the crooked stem. <words>28</words>
The goose vanished into cloud, leaving only a single feather spiraling down toward the foam, and she understood the price of perfection was never the flaw but the refusal to let it stay. <words>29</words>
She uncorked the vial she had kept for years, the flawless tincture glowing like trapped starlight, and poured it into the bellows until the leather darkened and softened like old grief. <words>28</words>
Then she carried the bellows to the open hatch where the wind tasted of iodine and distance, and she breathed through it once, twice, sending the tincture out as mist that glittered and fell. <words>30</words>
The tide rose to meet it, imperfect, unstoppable, and the herbalist, no longer sapped, lay on the warm floorboards to nap beneath the wheeling sky, her dreams ragged and beautiful as wings. <words>30</words>
