The arrogant swordsman, doubtfully confident in the calligraphy master's courtyard, studied the faded tapestry fragment between breaths. <words>19</words>
Its threads whispered of shackled potential, of blades that once sang but now lay silent beneath ink-stained silence. <words>31</words>
He had come to authorize the traditional song sung at every family wedding, the one his grandmother hummed when steel met silk in her stories. <words>46</words>
But the courtyard held only wind and the master's brush, moving like a duel across rice paper. <words>58</words>
"You seek to deliver a spark where all lights have gone out," the master said, not looking up, her voice carrying harsh tenderness. <words>73</words>
The swordsman's hand twitched toward his blade, then stopped—here, weapons were words, and he had none sharp enough. <words>86</words>
The tapestry fragment trembled in his palm, its colors bleeding like old wounds. <words>96</words>
Between breaths, he remembered his sister's wedding, how the song had faltered when their father fell to his own pride. <words>110</words>
The master dipped her brush in crimson ink. <words>117</words>
"Your arrogance is a cage," she said, "but cages can be unmade, if you learn the weight of silence." <words>132</words>
He knelt, doubtfully confident still, but the courtyard's stones were cool against his knees. <words>144</words>
The traditional song rose unbidden in his throat, raw as a new-forged blade. <words>155</words>
He sang it not to authorize, but to remember—the way his grandmother's voice had carried across battlefields, stitching wounds with melody. <words>171</words>
The faded tapestry fragment pulsed, its shackled potential unfurling like a banner. <words>182</words>
Between breaths, the swordsman saw his future: not as a blade, but as the song itself, carrying sparks through darkness. <words>196</words>
The master smiled, her brush completing a single character: 火, fire. <words>207</words>
"Now you may deliver," she said, "but know this—every spark burns the hand that holds it." <words>222</words>
He stood, the tapestry fragment now warm against his palm, its threads singing with possibility. <words>235</words>
The courtyard held its breath as he walked away, no longer arrogant, but carrying harsh tenderness like a secret blade. <words>250</words>
At the next wedding, he would sing—not to authorize tradition, but to unshackle it, to let the song become what it always meant to be. <words>267</words>
Between breaths, between notes, between the fall of ink and the rise of steel, he would deliver his spark. <words>282</words>
The faded tapestry fragment became his standard, its colors no longer faded but burning with every voice that joined his. <words>297</words>
In the calligraphy master's courtyard, the wind carried the echo of his transformation, harsh and tender as a blade learning to sing. <words>314</words>
The swordsman walked on, doubtfully confident no more, but certain in his uncertainty, carrying shackled potential now freed to burn bright. <words>333</words>
And somewhere, between breaths, his grandmother smiled. <words>343</words>
The song would live, not as tradition's chain, but as fire's promise. <words>356</words>
In every wedding hence, they would sing not just to remember, but to become—the swordsman's spark igniting countless flames where lights had gone out. <words>380</words>
