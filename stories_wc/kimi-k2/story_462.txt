The town-weary traveler pushed through the rusted turnstile of the abandoned carnival house of mirrors, clutching the stained glass panel he had pried from the chapel of his childhood. <words>31</words>
Its colors—cobalt, blood-orange, and bruised violet—caught the moonlight like the cradle of sparks he once watched leap from a blacksmith’s anvil, each shard of light a memory he could no longer bear to hold. <words>42</words>
Inside, the mirrors hung crooked, their silver backing peeling like old paint, reflecting not his face but the versions of himself he had tried to leave behind in every town whose name he forgot. <words>36</words>
He set the panel on the cracked carousel platform, where wooden horses with chipped teeth grinned in hammered repose, their painted eyes wide with the same exhaustion he felt in his chest. <words>34</words>
The wind off the coast slipped through broken shutters, and with it came the rhythmic tapping of a metal sign—FUNLAND, it once proclaimed—now swinging like a pendulum, its letters half-gone, its voice a dull chime against the night. <words>40</words>
Each tap was a heartbeat, a reminder that escape was not a place but a direction, and he knelt beside the stained glass, pressing his palms to its surface as if it could absorb the storm inside him. <words>38</words>
He had come here not to remember but to forget, to fertilize the barren soil of his mind with something other than regret, and the sign’s tapping became a method, a metronome for surrender. <words>36</words>
With a shard from the panel’s edge—intentionally accidental, the way a prayer slips out before you realize you’re praying—he scored the carousel’s center post, carving a spiral that began tight and widened like a scream. <words>39</words>
The mirrors caught the motion and multiplied it, so that everywhere he looked, he saw himself cutting, releasing, letting the past spill out in glittering dust. <words>29</words>
The cradle of sparks flared again—not fire, but the moment before, the breath held, the flint struck—and he understood that the confines he fled were not towns or memories but the silence he carried like a second skin. <words>41</words>
He stood, the stained glass now cracked in a pattern that mirrored the spiral, and the sign tapped once more, softer, as if the wind itself had paused. <words>31</words>
In the hush before someone finally says, “I love you,” he whispered it to the empty house, to the mirrors, to the boy he had been and the man he might still become. <words>35</words>
The words did not echo; they settled, light as ash, and for the first time, the traveler felt the borders of his mind soften, not broken but opened, like a seed cracked by frost, ready. <words>38</words>
He left the stained glass where it lay, a prism for whatever dawn might come, and walked back through the mirrors without flinching from their gaze. <words>30</words>
Behind him, the sign kept tapping, but now it sounded like a heartbeat, steady and unafraid, as the cradle of sparks cooled into something like peace. <words>30</words>
