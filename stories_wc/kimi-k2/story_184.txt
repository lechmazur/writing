<story>
In the vacuum chamber garden, where oxygen was optional and sarcasm mandatory, scrappy tavern-hand Ludo swept broken seashells into a pile while the sands of time flowed backward like a cheap hourglass someone had flipped in protest. <words>42</words>
He muttered flippantly solemn oaths about destiny, because inescapable callings were the worst kind of customer—never tipping, always lingering. <words>59</words>
Each cracked shell had once belonged to travelers who paid tabs with ocean memories, and now they whispered tides in reverse, urging him to randomize his fate the way dice randomize regret. <words>82</words>
Predictably unpredictable, Ludo kicked the pile, scattering spirals and shards across the fossilized footprints embedded in the dried-up riverbed that ran through the center of the garden. <words>105</words>
The footprints belonged to extinct dreamers who had tried to flee their own callings; their calcified toes pointed toward exits that had since been vacuum-sealed. <words>128</words>
Ludo pressed his bare heel into a three-toed track, feeling the echo of someone else’s failed escape fizz against his skin like flat soda. <words>150</words>
The chamber’s artificial dusk deepened, and the backward-flowing sand began to hiss, rearranging itself into a countdown only entropy understood. <words>173</words>
He scooped a handful of broken shells, considered making a necklace, then remembered necklaces were for people who stayed put. <words>195</words>
Instead, he arranged them along the footprints, a breadcrumb trail for whatever imagination might dare to catapult beyond known realms. <words>218</words>
A low hum rose from the riverbed; the fossils glowed, projecting holographic memories of the dreamers’ last flippant solemn words: “If you can’t beat the calling, mock it until it blushes.” <words>247</words>
Ludo laughed, because mockery was the only currency he hadn’t spent. <words>262</words>
The shells began to spin, their jagged edges carving tiny auroras in the vacuum; each rotation randomized the pattern of footprints, scrambling past and future like eggs in a cosmic omelet. <words>292</words>
He felt the tug—inescapable, annoying, familiar—an undertow of purpose disguised as wanderlust. <words>313</words>
Predictably unpredictable, he saluted the glowing fossils, slung his broom across his shoulder like a rifle, and stepped deliberately into the freshest track, the one that hadn’t been there a second ago. <words>345</words>
The riverbed cracked open, revealing a spiral staircase of compressed starlight leading downward, or upward, or sideways—directions were negotiable. <words>373</words>
Broken seashells clattered after him, reassembling mid-air into a fractured compass that pointed everywhere at once. <words>396</words>
As he descended, the tavern’s distant music played in reverse, a jukebox elegy for every patron who ever mistook leaving for arriving. <words>423</words>
Ludo grinned, tasting vacuum and salt. <words>432</words>
If the calling wanted him, it would have to chase him through every randomized corridor of his own imagination, past footprints yet to be fossilized, while sands flowed backward just to keep up. <words>468</words>
He winked at the darkness, flippantly solemn to the end, and whispered, “Last round’s on destiny—hope it brought exact change.” <words>495</words>
