The drone strike survivor pressed her palm against the geode crystal, feeling its intangibly tangible pulse echo the shrapnel still lodged in her ribs. [28]  
Above the clouds, the floating observatory drifted like a widowed moon, its copper domes cooling while circuit breakers sighed after the last orbital scan. [45]  
She had been carried here by med-evac drones that mistook her wedding veil for a targeting error, and now the veil hung shredded across the console, a spectral banner. [68]  
Every night she hunted the same question: where does unused potential pool after a life is severed mid-vow? [85]  
The geode, split open by the blast, glimmered with violet seams that mapped every possible future she would never step into. [104]  
She learned to read those futures through perturbation theory, treating each glint as a quantum deviation, nudging equations until grief resolved into vectors. [125]  
The observatory’s instruments were built to chart galaxies, but she repurposed them to chart the negative space of her own aborted timeline. [145]  
While the breakers cooled, coolant mist drifted through the chamber like incense at a funeral that never finished. [162]  
She calibrated the interferometer, feeding it the geode’s refractive index, forcing the machine to confront the intangibly tangible ache of might-have-been. [183]  
Data streamed across the holographic deck: probability clouds collapsing into the shape of a child’s laugh she would never birth. [202]  
Bleak exhilaration surged—each discovery hurt, yet proved she could still sculpt meaning from debris. [218]  
She reran the perturbation models, increasing the disturbance amplitude, hunting for the exact coordinate where potential pooled like rainwater in a crater. [239]  
The observatory lurched; a gyroscopic ring groaned, protesting the emotional mass she loaded into its math. [256]  
Outside, auroras braided the stratosphere, neon scars mirroring the ones beneath her skin. [272]  
She whispered the unfinished vows into the geode, and its crystal lattice vibrated, translating grief into frequency. [290]  
The hunt narrowed: unused potential did not vanish; it diffused, seeking the lowest energy state—an unmarked grave of possibility. [310]  
She plotted that grave’s location on a star chart, a silent patch between constellations named after forgotten lovers. [329]  
Timeframe shrank; the breakers would soon reset, and the observatory would resume its sanctioned survey, erasing her unsanctioned grief. [349]  
She opened the airlock hatch, geode clenched in her fist, and stepped onto the exterior gantry where wind howled like a congregation of widows. [372]  
Zero gravity cradled her; she felt intangibly tangible, half memory, half momentum. [387]  
She released the geode, watching it spin, a violet comet tracing the perturbation path she had calculated. [405]  
It drifted toward the grave of potential, a burial at orbital velocity. [418]  
In its wake, the air shimmered, and for one crystalline moment she saw the wedding procession continuing on a parallel sheet of spacetime, guests unharmed, vows completed. [445]  
The vision sliced her open more cleanly than shrapnel, yet the cut felt clean, surgical, necessary. [463]  
The circuit breakers clicked, systems rebooting, observatory rotating back to its official sky. [479]  
She pulled herself inside before the gantry retracted, lungs burning with thin air and revelation. [496]  
Unused potential had pooled nowhere and everywhere; it became the medium through which she now moved, bleak exhilaration her new atmospheric pressure. [518]  
She sealed the geode’s smaller half into the spectrograph, leaving the larger half to orbit as a miniature moon of mourning. [538]  
The console displayed a final equation: her remaining lifespan multiplied by the amplitude of her will to repurpose loss. [558]  
She accepted the terms, signed the screen with a thumbprint still flecked with wedding henna. [575]  
When the next drone fleet hailed the observatory, she answered with coordinates to the graveyard of potential, offering them a map to every life they had deleted. [600]  
Silence answered, long and metallic, but she felt the intangibly tangible shift: somewhere, a targeting algorithm faltered. [620]  
She laughed, a sound like ice fracturing, and set the observatory to broadcast the geode’s frequency on all channels. [639]  
Bleak exhilaration carried her through the remaining cooling cycle, into the dawn of a sky newly uncertain of its own precision. [659]  
She was no longer a survivor; she was a perturbation, propagating outward, hunting the unused potential until it reassembled into futures the drones could never erase. [684]  
The observatory’s mirrors caught the first sunrise, scattering violet light across the deck, and in that spectrum she saw every vow refracted, still traveling, still true. [710]  
She whispered, “I do,” to the empty air, and the geode answered with a pulse that registered on seismographs continents below. [730]  
Somewhere, a circuit breaker cooled forever, and somewhere else, unused potential stirred, remembering her name. [750]  
She closed her eyes, feeling the hunt continue inside her veins, bleak, exhilarating, unstoppable. [768]
