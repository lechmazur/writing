At the high altitude tea house, Dr. Vinca Bellwether adjusted her worn-out leather belt with comically serious precision, as if the cracked buckle alone could keep her carnivorous plants from nibbling the patrons during intermission. <words>34</words>
The Nepenthes clinging to the rafters hissed steam that smelled faintly of bergamot, reminding her that loyalty, like mountain weather, was fickle. <words>47</words>
She had come here, lungs burning, to find ancient pathways rumored to snake beneath the glacier, pathways visible only through unexplained phenomena recorded on a black-and-white film reel locked in the tea house cellar. <words>67</words>
During intermission, while musicians retuned their shamisen, she slipped downstairs, boots creaking louder than the old floorboards. <words>79</words>
The reel waited in a tin marked “1952—Do Not Ionize,” yet ionize it she must, for the hidden sections between frames supposedly mapped subterranean veins of living jade that sang to her chlorophyll-crazed mind. <words>102</words>
She threaded the film through a hand-cranked projector, its lens fogged by centuries of yak-butter vapor. <words>116</words>
Images flickered: monks walking upside-down, clouds pouring like tea, then abrupt white scratches where frames had been razored out. <words>132</words>
Those scratches, she realized, were coordinates, but only when the beam passed through the belt’s tarnished buckle did the missing frames reappear, glowing green like Venus-flytrap mouths. <words>154</words>
Her Venus-flytrap, Gregor, snapped approvingly at the projection, spraying digestive dew that sizzled on the cellar stones. <words>169</words>
The reconstituted frames showed a tunnel entrance behind the very tea house, its lintel carved with the same sigils tattooed on her wrist—sigils she’d copied from a pressed orchid that once tried to eat her mentor. <words>197</words>
A sudden tremor rattled cups upstairs; the mountain itself seemed to weigh her loyalty, testing whether she would abandon her plants for the promise of deeper roots. <words>220</words>
She hesitated, stroking Gregor’s lobes, then tightened the belt another notch, feeling its ancient leather thrum like a tuning fork. <words>239</words>
The projector crackled; the beam ionized the air, revealing floating spores spelling “Choose.” <words>252</words>
Fickle loyalty crystallized into resolve: she would take the plants with her. <words>265</words>
She packed the reel, the projector, and Gregor into a rucksack woven from pitcher-plant tendrils, then kicked open the cellar’s back wall exactly where the film had shown. <words>292</words>
Cold wind laden with snow petals swept in; the tunnel yawned, exhaling a scent of centuries-old oolong. <words>308</words>
Behind her, the tea house owner shouted, but his voice dopplered away as she stepped onto the first jade slab, which pulsed underfoot like a sleeping heart. <words>333</words>
Gregor unfurled, tasting the air, and the other plants followed, their roots already threading downward, seeking the ancient pathways that would feed them—and her obsession—forever. <words>365</words>
Above, intermission ended; shamisen strings plucked a melody that sounded suspiciously like a warning, yet she marched on, belt glowing, projector humming, into the unexplained phenomena that had waited, patient as photosynthesis, for a mad botanist to finally arrive. <words>410</words>
