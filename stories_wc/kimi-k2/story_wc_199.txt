In the hush where past meets prophecy, the ashen skyborne arbor drifted above the valley like a slow gray cloud, its branches of petrified ash holding the last leaves that refused to fall. [38]
Below, on a platform of woven vine and slate, stood Elian, orderly seed sorter of the Cloudbound Guild, sleeves rolled to the elbow, fingers stained the color of walnut. [55]
Each dawn he arranged the valley’s seeds—barley, thistle, moon-melon—into perfect spirals, believing that if pattern could be imposed on life, then life might answer back with meaning. [73]
Regional folklore claimed the arbor was once a living tree that tried to climb the moon; punished by jealous stars, it burned to ash yet remained aloft, forever catching the wind’s confessions. [91]
Elian had always dismissed the tale as embroidery for children, until the morning a single leaf drifted down and landed on his sorting table, its veins spelling a script too delicate for ordinary eyes. [109]
He lifted the leaf, and a speck of moonstone cabochon dust glimmered where petiole met blade, no larger than a mote of pollen yet shining with borrowed lunar light. [127]
The speck warmed against his skin, and in that warmth he felt a pulse like a question mark, urging him to decode the message in falling leaves before the arbor itself forgot how to remember. [146]
So he began building tiny monuments to forgotten things: a barley grain balanced on a thistle needle to honor extinct bees, a moon-melon seed glued with sap to commemorate vanished tides. [165]
Each miniature shrine fit inside the hollow of his thumb; he placed them along the arbor’s ash-gray boughs where wind could prod them gently, the way memory prods a sleeper. [183]
Day after day more leaves descended, each carrying its own fleck of moonstone dust, each vein rearranged into sharper runes. [197]
Elian copied the runes into a ledger, cross-referencing them with seed patterns, until he realized the script was not writing but choreography, a dance map for something that must emerge transformed always. [216]
The regional folklore whispered again: when the last leaf falls, the arbor will exhale its final secret, and whoever reads it will become the next guardian of the sky. [234]
Fear pricked him—guardianship sounded like exile—but curiosity was stronger, mossy delight curling around his ribs at the thought of roots in clouds. [251]
He worked faster, monuments multiplying along the branches like frost: a ring of poppy seeds for lullabies no longer sung, a tower of sesame for promises broken under eclipses. [270]
The arbor responded; its ashen bark softened to the color of wet slate, and the hush deepened until even the wind held breath. [285]
On the seventh dusk, only one leaf remained, trembling at the tip of the highest twig. [297]
Elian climbed, pockets clinking with spare seeds, heart drumming the rhythm he had deciphered from the runes. [311]
At the summit he cupped the leaf; the moonstone speck flared, projecting a constellation across the inside of his eyelids. [325]
The constellation rearranged itself into the outline of a seed, then a sprout, then a tree, then ash, then a seed again—an eternal loop that emerges transformed always. [344]
Understanding flooded him: the message was not a warning but an invitation to join the cycle, to become the next shape the arbor dreams into being. [361]
He placed his last monument—a single dust-speck of moonstone pressed into a flake of his own skin—onto the twig. [375]
The leaf fell. [377]
The arbor sighed, releasing a storm of silver ash that spiraled around Elian, lifting him root and branch. [391]
His body dissolved into motes of walnut-stained light, each mote a seed of memory. [403]
Where he had stood, a new leaf unfurled, larger than any before, its veins spelling the first line of the next folklore. [417]
Down below, valley children would soon speak of the orderly seed sorter who became the arbor’s heartbeat, whose monuments still glint on moonless nights like tiny forgotten stars. [437]
And in the hush where past meets prophecy, the ashen skyborne arbor drifted on, carrying inside its branches the transformed librarian of leaves, forever sorting the seeds of what might yet be. [461]
Sometimes, when the wind is kind, a faint mossy laughter can be heard among the boughs, the sound of Elian delighting in every new leaf that learns how to fall. [480]
