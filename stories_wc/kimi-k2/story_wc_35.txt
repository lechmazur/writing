At the close of an unspoken dream, the desert fortress exhaled cool rain, its sandstone walls steaming like fresh bread. [21]  
Chef Lira pressed her tongue to the air, tasting the memory of every droplet that had ever fallen on these battlements. [34]  
The flavor was remorse—sharp, metallic, stored in the stone like salt in cured meat. [45]  
She carried it in her palms now, an emotionally contagious residue that made the guards at the gate flinch when she brushed past them. [61]  
They lowered their spears, eyes wet with borrowed sorrow, and let her descend the hidden lift beneath the dunes. [75]  
The coral icebound pavilion waited below, a frozen reef glowing turquoise inside its cavern of sand. [88]  
Columns of calcified sea fans arched overhead, brittle yet sturdy, humming with the same remorse she had licked from the rain. [104]  
Years ago, Lira had served the fortress lord a last meal before he marched south; the lamb had carried her memory of his daughter’s drowning, and he had wept until the blade fell from his hand. [125]  
He spared the child-prisoners but never forgave himself, sealing his regret inside this pavilion like a jar of over-fermented grief. [142]  
Tonight Lira returned to sandpaper those rough memories, to subsume them into something a tongue could bear. [156]  
She knelt beside a tidal pool no larger than a dinner plate, its water trembling with moonlight that had never seen the open sea. [172]  
By analyzing tidal pool formations—the spiral of a periwinkle, the fracture lines in evaporating salt—she could read the story of every tear the fortress had refused to shed. [192]  
The pool showed her the lord’s final dream: his daughter’s small hand slipping through his gauntlet, the weight of armor dragging him down while she floated away. [212]  
Lira tasted the image; it burned like vinegar on a cut. [221]  
She set her copper pot on a tripod of coral, poured the pool inside, and stirred with a whisk made from the lord’s own helmet plume. [238]  
Steam rose, carrying the memory outward; the pavilion’s ice began to sweat, droplets falling like slow applause. [252]  
She touched the nearest column, letting the emotionally contagious remorse flow through her fingertips into the stone. [267]  
The coral softened, color returning to its bleached skeleton, as if shame could be coaxed back into living tissue. [281]  
Yet the taste remained harsh, metallic, unfinished. [289]  
Lira understood: to truly sandpaper the memory, she must subsume it completely, become the flavor and then let it dissolve. [305]  
She dipped her finger into the pot and licked the broth. [314]  
At once she was the lord on the rain-slick battlement, armor heavy with regret, watching the horizon for a daughter who would never come home. [334]  
The emotion swelled, threatening to drown her, but she held it on her tongue like a too-hot spoonful. [349]  
She exhaled slowly, releasing the taste as vapor that crystallized into tiny salt flowers on the pavilion floor. [364]  
Each flower held a fragment of the memory: the splash, the cry, the silence. [376]  
When the last crystal settled, the coral columns stood sturdy yet no longer brittle, their surfaces warm to the touch. [392]  
Lira packed the salt flowers into a small tin, labeling it in grease pencil: “Lamb, drowned daughter, forgiven.” [408]  
She climbed the lift, emerging into the fortress courtyard where dawn now rinsed the sandstone gold. [423]  
The guards no longer flinched when she passed; their eyes were clear, as if a long fever had broken. [437]  
In the kitchen she sprinkled a single crystal into the morning stew. [449]  
The flavor bloomed gentle, ocean-sweet, carrying only the echo of loss rather than its full weight. [463]  
The lord, now old and gray, tasted the stew and smiled without tears for the first time in twenty years. [478]  
Later, when the fortress emptied for the season, Lira returned to the dunes. [490]  
She pressed her ear to the sand and heard the coral pavilion singing, a low tide of gratitude. [503]  
The rain had stopped; the dream had spoken its final word. [513]  
She walked away, tin tucked in her apron, ready to taste the next stored remorse the world insisted on keeping. [530]  
Behind her, the fortress stood sturdy, its walls no longer weeping at the close of every unspoken dream. [548]  
The desert sun rose higher, sandpaper
