The abandoned spaceport baggage claim echoed with the slow drip of fractal sorrow as I, last pilot of the flying library, knelt among broken conveyors to search for a single detached coat button. <words>34</words>
Its mother-of-pearl face glimmered like a miniature moon, the final relic of the uniform my grandmother wore when she first lifted the airborne shelves above the clouds to preserve a fading tradition. <words>34</words>
I pressed the button to my lips, tasting dust and jet fuel, and in that second a simple yes or no can change everything, I whispered the question the elders had taught me: will the bridge to unity still stand after tonight? <words>39</words>
The answer had to be spiritually secular, neither prayer nor equation, but something breathed between them, so I set my copper kettle on a cracked luggage scale and brewed the last arabica we carried. <words>32</words>
Steam curled into constellations; I tipped the cup, let the grounds settle, and began the forbidden art of reading the future in coffee stains, tracing spirals that looked like runways dissolving into starlight. <words>31</words>
A shape emerged: two towers leaning together across a dark gulf, their cables frayed yet luminous, and I knew the vision showed the bridge to unity, the mythic span that once let stories cross between warring colonies. <words>34</words>
My finger hovered over the stain; one clockwise swirl would obliterate the bridge from collective memory, one counter-clockwise would let it rise again, but both choices carried the same fractal sorrow of loss. <words>32</words>
I heard the library engines humming outside, their wings rustling like old pages, waiting for the weight of my decision before we lifted off this ruined planet forever. <words>26</words>
The button in my palm grew warm, as if the generations it had witnessed now pressed against my skin, urging me to honor the tradition not by keeping it unchanged but by letting it evolve. <words>32</words>
I turned the cup three times widdershins, watching the stain blur into a flock of migrating birds, and felt the bridge to unity shimmer back into possibility, no longer stone and steel but living narrative carried on wings. <words>34</words>
The copper kettle cooled; I pocketed the button, shouldered my satchel of books, and walked toward the exit where moonlight pooled like spilled ink across the cracked tiles. <words>28</words>
Behind me, the abandoned spaceport baggage claim sighed, its fractal sorrow folding inward, already forgetting the moment when a spiritually secular ritual rewrote tomorrow. <words>25</words>
I climbed the ramp into the flying library, fastened the button to my new coat, and lifted us into the night sky, the bridge to unity now a constellation of stories we would seed among distant stars. <words>34</words>
