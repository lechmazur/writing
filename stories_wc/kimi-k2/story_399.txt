In the witch's crystal scrying room, where starlight fractured into prismatic veins across obsidian walls, the grumpy crypt caretaker clutched an unmarked cardboard tube like a relic of forgotten grief. <words>31</words>
Throughout stargazing, he traced constellations not in the sky but in the patterns in a sand mandala spread across the scrying table, each grain a memory he had buried beneath sarcasm and shovels. <words>42</words>
The tube, light yet heavier than any coffin lid, seemed to jiggle with a heartbeat of its own, as though the trauma sealed inside had learned to pulse. <words>55</words>
He had come here not for prophecy but to quell an uprising within, a rebellion of singular moments—his mother's last breath, the child's unanswered scream, the lover's letter never sent—that had begun to multiply singular into a chorus. <words>78</words>
The witch, absent tonight, left only her instruments: spheres of quartz, mirrors black as regret, and the mandala, a galaxy of colored sand spiraling inward like the caretaker's own collapsing chest. <words>97</words>
He unstoppered the tube; out slid a rolled photograph, edges curled like dead leaves, showing himself younger, smiling, before the cemetery gates became his mouth. <words>117</words>
The image trembled between his fingers, and the caretaker felt the photograph jiggle again, not from motion but from the weight of what it refused to forget. <words>136</words>
He laid it atop the mandala, aligning the child's eyes in the picture with a blue star of sand, and whispered, "You were supposed to stay buried." <words>156</words>
The mandala shimmered; grains lifted, rearranged, forming new constellations that spelled his unspoken names: Orphan, Guardian, Coward, Witness. <words>175</words>
Each name multiplied singular into legion, and the caretaker understood the importance of trauma: not to erase it, but to let it orbit like distant moons, tugging tides without crashing shores. <words>199</words>
He pressed the photograph back into the tube, but now the cardboard felt warm, as if the image had forgiven being hidden. <words>219</words>
Outside, a meteor scratched the sky; inside, the caretaker breathed once, twice, and the uprising within quieted, not silenced but stilled, like soldiers lowering banners at dusk. <words>243</words>
He traced the mandala's outer ring, a circle of gold sand, and spoke aloud for the first time in years: "I kept you all like graves I never visited." <words>268</words>
The room answered with silence grandiose in its subtlety, the kind that fills cathedrals and tombs alike. <words>287</words>
He left the tube beside the mandala, an offering neither witch nor ghost had demanded, and stepped into the night where stars, indifferent and eternal, continued their ancient burning. <words>315</words>
Behind him, the mandala began to collapse, grains sliding into the photograph's curl, sealing memory back into darkness—but now darkness felt less like a crypt and more like a womb. <words>348</words>
Throughout stargazing, the caretaker walked home lighter, not healed but rearranged, the cardboard tube's absence a new constellation inside his ribs. <words>378</words>
And in the witch's crystal scrying room, the sand settled into a single spiral, a fingerprint left by a man who learned that carrying the dead is lighter when you let them breathe. <words>418</words>
