Across the hush of dawn’s second breath, the tortured protector slipped through the torn canvas flap of the abandoned circus dressing room, clutching a cracked porcelain doll whose painted smile looked suspiciously sweet against the mildewed mirrors. <words>34</words>
He had once sworn to guard the child who owned it, but the big top fire had swallowed both child and oath, leaving him to wander guilt-sharpened years. <words>47</words>
Tonight, though, the doll’s glaze glimmered with starlight, as if urging him toward the unknown he had always fled. <words>57</words>
A faded poster on the wall announced a free planetarium show at sunrise; the coincidence felt like a dare from fate itself. <words>68</words>
He tucked the doll inside his coat, its porcelain cheek icy against his ribs, and set off through the deserted midway where carousel horses grinned their wooden, playful-serious grins. <words>82</words>
The city observatory rose ahead, a silent dome promising answers or oblivion. <words>91</words>
Inside, the projector already hummed; an elderly janitor nodded as if expecting him, then vanished, leaving only rows of empty seats and the scent of burnt sugar lingering like a suspiciously sweet memory. <words>107</words>
The protector chose the center seat, drew the doll onto his lap, and waited. <words>114</words>
Stars bloomed above, swirling into the constellation that had hung over the circus the night of the fire. <words>125</words>
The porcelain cracked wider, a hairline fracture racing from the doll’s heart to its painted lips. <words>135</words>
A voice—soft, childlike, yet echoing cosmic distances—whispered, “You kept me safe, but safety was never the gift I needed.” <words>148</words>
Tears salted the protector’s mouth as he understood: guarding had become his cage, denying both of them the freedom of the unknown. <words>160</words>
The dome darkened further, revealing a void that pulsed like a waiting stage. <words>169</words>
He stood, cradling the doll, and spoke aloud the vow he had once choked back: “I embrace the fate I denied us both.” <words>182</words>
With deliberate fingers he snapped the remaining porcelain, letting the shards fall like brittle snow. <words>192</words>
Light poured from the hollow shell, coalescing into the translucent figure of the child, older now, eyes galaxies wide. <words>204</words>
She smiled—not the painted smile of the doll, but one alive with mischief and mercy. <words>214</words>
Together they stepped toward the projection beam; the planetarium dissolved into swirling nebulae, the abandoned circus dressing room flickered like a forgotten prop. <words>228</words>
The protector felt his guilt unravel, threads snapping into stardust. <words>236</words>
At the threshold, he hesitated, but the child took his hand, her grip both playful and serious. <words>247</words>
“Unleash me,” she said, “and yourself.” <words>253</words>
He inhaled the hush of dawn’s second breath once more, then crossed into the unknown, the cracked porcelain doll empty and luminous behind them. <words>267</words>
The projector clicked off; the janitor returned, swept the shards into a dustpan, and hung a new poster for tomorrow’s show titled “Second Chances.” <words>282</words>
Outside, the first true sunlight painted the abandoned circus dressing room gold, and somewhere beyond the sky, two silhouettes danced across newborn constellations. <words>298</words>
