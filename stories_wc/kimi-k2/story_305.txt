The reticent scholar, Elian, stood waist-deep in the flooded opera house, lantern light trembling across the water like nervous applause. <words>21</words>
He balanced the ancient clay tablet with runes on a floating velvet seat, its glyphs shimmering whenever the lanterns coughed. <words>34</words>
Tonight, while the city baked cakes for the duke’s jubilee, Elian planned to dethrone complacency with a single, technically mischievous performance. <words>49</words>
He had spent years decoding the tablet’s warning: “A gathering of echoes will unseat the deaf.” <words>63</words>
To stage that gathering, he needed voices the duke had silenced—those of drowned musicians whose sheet music still drifted like pale fish. <words>79</words>
Elian opened the swollen dictionary he had salvaged from the library’s attic; between pages 314 and 315, his own sketches fluttered, charcoal ghosts of the opera’s original score. <words>100</words>
Each sketch was a keyhole; when aligned with the tablet’s runes, they formed a lock. <words>113</words>
He pressed the first sketch against the tablet; the runes pulsed, and a low knock sounded beneath the water—three measured taps, polite yet insistent. <words>131</words>
Another sketch, another knock; soon the flooded pit became a drum, summoning the gathering of echoes. <words>146</words>
Phantoms in soaked evening dress rose, their mouths open in silent O’s of remembered arias. <words>161</words>
Elian felt pensive mirth tug at his lips; the duke’s censors had banned these songs for “excessive truth,” yet here they were, tuning themselves. <words>180</words>
He slid the final sketch into place; the tablet cracked, releasing a chord so pure the lanterns steadied. <words>196</words>
The echoes inhaled, then sang—not with voices but with memories of voices, a choir of absences. <words>212</words>
Water rippled into sheet-music lines; notes bobbed like currants in the duke’s neglected cake batter across town. <words>228</words>
Elian’s reticence melted; he conducted with the dictionary’s spine, technically mischievous downbeats splashing droplets into lantern halos. <words>248</words>
The aria rose, recounting every bribe, every silenced critic, every child who would never hear this music in the duke’s newly “safe” repertoire. <words>269</words>
On shore, citizens frosting cakes paused, hearing the impossible hymn seep through drains and open windows. <words>287</words>
Some wept; others, feeling the complacency they wore like aprons, loosened the strings. <words>303</words>
The duke, tasting batter in his palace, heard the knock of history against his teeth and dropped the silver spoon. <words>321</words>
Elian let the dictionary sink; its pages would become coral for future scholars less reticent. <words>338</words>
The echoes, mission accomplished, bowed and dissolved into moonlit ripples. <words>353</words>
Alone now, Elian climbed the ruined stage, water lapping at his ankles like a timid encore. <words>370</words>
He whispered to the dark house, “Listen again tomorrow,” and the lanterns flickered agreement, already planning new mischief. <words>390</words>
