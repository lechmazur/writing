The coy spy known only as Finch arrived at the witch's potion brewery when the morning paper landed on an empty porch, its headline screaming of war while no one was there to read it. <words>34</words>
Inside the cedar-shingled shop, steam curled like borrowed valor around shelves of bottled mischief, and Finch fingered the loose button on his coat—the last trace of the uniform he had once worn for the wrong side. <words>37</words>
He had come to bypass the ordinary limits of flesh and reputation, to slip through reversed time itself and mend fences with the comrade he had betrayed, a man now three years dead. <words>34</words>
The witch, a diabolically benevolent woman named Mother Voss, greeted him with eyes like cracked opals and offered a draught that tasted of iron and lilacs. <words>27</words>
"One swallow sends you backward," she warned, "but the price is whatever valor you borrowed must be returned with interest." <words>22</words>
Finch drank, and the room folded like wet parchment until he stood in the same brewery two years earlier, the air bright with unspent hope. <words>25</words>
Across the counter stood Rowan, alive, laughing at some private joke, the same loose button missing from his cuff where Finch had torn it during their last scuffle. <words>28</words>
Finch's practiced disguises felt suddenly flimsy; to become a master of disguise meant nothing if he could not disguise remorse. <words>24</words>
He stepped forward, palms open, and spoke the words he had rehearsed in nightmares: "I sold the patrol route for a pocket of coins and a promise of rank." <words>30</words>
Rowan's smile guttered, yet he listened while the potion's reversed time eddied around them like warm rain. <words>21</words>
Finch pressed the loose button into Rowan's hand, the metal still warm from his own pocket, a small, round confession. <words>23</words>
Rowan's fingers closed over it, and in that clasp Finch felt the fence between them splinter and re-knit, not erased but rewoven, stronger for the scar. <words>28</words>
The witch's clock chimed once; borrowed valor drained from Finch like water from a cracked vessel, leaving him hollow yet strangely light. <words>25</words>
Time snapped forward, flinging him back to the empty porch where the morning paper now read: "Local Hero Rowan Saved by Anonymous Warning." <words>25</words>
Finch walked away unremarkable, no medals, no uniform, just a man whose coat was missing a button and whose face, for the first time, was honestly his own. <words>29</words>
In the brewery window, Mother Voss raised a teacup in salute, her diabolically benevolent smile suggesting she had already brewed this ending before he ever knocked. <words>28</words>
Somewhere, a loose button rolled across a wooden counter and came to rest against a glass jar labeled "Forgiveness—use sparingly." <words>24</words>
Finch kept walking, the borrowed valor returned, the fence mended, the disguise mastered by being finally discarded. <words>21</words>
