The bookbinder, whose telekinetic fingers once stitched spines with invisible threads, now stood before the abandoned carnival prize booth, its faded banners whispering of forgotten triumphs. <words>31</words>
Across the tapestry of lost legends, he had wandered seeking the power of transformation—not for glory, but to revive the dying art of binding stories into living flesh. <words>42</words>
In his pocket rested a single chopstick wrapper, its red paper dragon curled like a secret, the last remnant of a meal shared with the master who had taught him that knowledge always demands its price. <words>57</words>
The booth's silence was absolute, yet when wind rattled the tin ducks, a sound bite of carnival music—three notes, no more—triggered sudden flashbacks that crashed through his mind like shattered glass. <words>75</words>
He saw himself at fifteen, learning to levitate pages without touching them, his master's voice casual as morning rain: "Every book you bind will take a memory; choose carefully what you're willing to forget." <words>93</words>
The wrapper trembled in his pocket, responding to his telekinetic pulse, and he understood this was no ordinary paper but a compressed tome, its knowledge waiting to be revived through the proper sequence of sounds. <words>112</words>
Another gust, another fragment of melody, and the flashbacks deepened: his master aging backward as each book was completed, knowledge flowing from teacher to text until only the wrapper remained. <words>131</words>
The bookbinder pressed the paper to his lips, feeling the dragon's scales shift under his touch, and whispered the price he would pay—not his memories, but his ability to ever read what others had written. <words>151</words>
The booth's machinery groaned to life, gears turning without power, as the wrapper unfolded into an origami library, each fold revealing volumes of transformation spells written in the language of moving paper. <words>171</words>
He understood now: true transformation required not just knowledge but sacrifice, and as he chose to surrender his reading gift, the carnival lights flickered on, revealing the booth had never been abandoned—merely waiting. <words>192</words>
The telekinetic threads that once bound books now bound his own transformation, weaving the wrapper's wisdom into his bones, and he felt the grandiose subtlety of becoming what he had always sought: a living book, written by wind and memory. <words>213</words>
As the final note of carnival music faded, he stepped into the booth's center, where the mechanical fortune teller raised her glass eyes and spoke in his master's voice: "The price is paid; now teach others what it means to be read by the world." <words>235</words>
The bookbinder smiled, his telekinetic powers now flowing outward like gentle tides, ready to bind new stories into those who would pay the price of knowledge, while he himself became the first chapter in an endless book of transformation. <words>256</words>
