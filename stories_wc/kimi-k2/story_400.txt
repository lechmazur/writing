The last human had stepped off the planet three winters ago, leaving only the druid, fiercely ambivalent about whether to mourn or celebrate. <words>25</words>
He lived in a glacial orchard suspended over a crevasse of blue ice, where pear trees grew like chandeliers of frost. <words>19</words>
Each year on the day he had been born, he prepared a special family meal prepared only on birthdays, though the family was now only memory and echo. <words>25</words>
This year the silence pressed heavier than the ice itself, and he feared it would crack him before the crevasse did. <words>18</words>
To break the silence, he decided to gather the ingredients he had hoarded: crystallized honey, wind-dried apples, and a single dull safety pin that had once fastened his daughter’s cloak. <words>27</words>
The pin was useless for pinning now, but he kept it because pain, like rust, had its own flavor. <words>17</words>
He walked the narrow catwalk of ice between the trees, humming a dirge with dour amusement at the thought of celebrating alone. <words>19</words>
A branch snapped; the sound ricocheted down the crevasse and came back as laughter, or so he imagined. <words>16</words>
He told himself the orchard was laughing with him, not at him, yet the distinction felt academic. <words>15</words>
At the center of the grove stood a stone table veined with frost; he laid the ingredients out like runes. <words>16</words>
The honey refused to soften, the apples clacked like teeth, and the safety pin merely lay there, reflecting nothing. <words>17</words>
He realized the meal required fire, but fire had died with the last human heart. <words>14</words>
Instead he breathed on the honey until his breath froze into a second skin over it, a glaze of regret. <words>17</words>
He pricked his thumb with the dull safety pin, letting one bead of blood fall onto the apples, a garnish of mortality. <words>19</words>
The color spread like sunrise across the white fruit, and for the first time in years he spoke aloud: “To those who are not here.” <words>23</words>
The words hung visible in the air, crystallizing into letters that chimed when they touched the branches. <words>15</words>
He gathered the letters like firewood and fed them to the stone table, which began to glow with borrowed warmth. <words>18</words>
The orchard sighed; ice shifted; somewhere below, the crevasse closed its mouth in surprise. <words>14</words>
He ate the meal slowly, tasting iron, sugar, and the faint metallic tang of fear dissolving. <words>15</words>
When the plate was empty, he pinned the safety pin to his own cloak, not to fasten it but to remind himself that edges, even dull ones, can still draw blood. <words>25</words>
The silence did not break so much as bow, acknowledging a truce. <words>11</words>
He smiled, a small crooked thing, and began planning next year’s feast, already wondering what new fear he might invite to the table. <words>22</words>
