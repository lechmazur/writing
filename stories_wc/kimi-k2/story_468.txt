Mortician Elara Finch stepped into the mangrove labyrinth at the hour when the night yields to golden embers, her satchel of dream journals already heavy with yesterday's polite anarchy. <words>31</words>
She moved loudly serene, boots squishing mud in deliberate rhythm, because the singing spirits only answered morticians who announced themselves like courteous thunder. <words>25</words>
On her wrist glinted a tarnished silver bracelet, the same one she had removed from a corpse whose final dream she still needed to collect. <words>24</words>
The corpse had been overly curious in life, a trait Elara now imitated by following footprints that vanish after a single heartbeat, prints shaped like question marks. <words>24</words>
Each print whispered a name she recognized from the journals: patients who had died mid-dream, leaving pages blank. <words>19</words>
She needed those missing endings to finish her anthology of posthumous thoughts, a compendium she believed would let the living understand death's architecture. <words>24</words>
A spirit drifted between roots, humming a lullaby that tasted of salt and regret. <words>14</words>
Elara bowed, voice soft but firm. <words>5</words>
"Good dawn, honored echo. <words>4</words>
I seek the rustle of revelation you guard." <words>8</words>
The spirit laughed, a sound like wind chimes caught in a storm. <words>11</words>
"Curiosity killed the collector once," it sang. <words>7</words>
"Will you imitate the dead to join them?" <words>8</words>
Elara touched the bracelet; the metal warmed, sensing kinship with the spirit's melody. <words>14</words>
"I collect dreams, not souls," she replied. <words>7</words>
"Yet every dream here is a soul's footprint, vanishing after a single heartbeat unless tethered by ink." <words>19</words>
The spirit circled her, trailing phosphorescent droplets that spelled unfinished sentences across the water. <words>15</words>
Elara opened her journal, pen poised like a scalpel. <words>9</words>
"Then let us write together, politely anarchic, until the golden embers cool." <words>15</words>
Roots shifted, forming a corridor lined with lanterns made of fireflies and regret. <words>13</words>
At its end lay a corpseâ€”her own, eyes wide with wonder, bracelet gleaming unblemished. <words>16</words>
The realization rustled through her like autumn leaves: she had died mid-collection, curiosity her final heartbeat. <words>18</words>
The spirits had been singing her unfinished dreams back to her, footprints she could now read because they were hers. <words>20</words>
Elara knelt, serene despite the loud truth, and began to write in the journal resting on her own chest. <words>18</words>
Each word anchored a footprint, preserving vanishing dreams against the next dawn. <words>13</words>
When the last ember dimmed, the labyrinth fell silent, politely anarchic in its acceptance. <words>15</words>
Elara closed the journal, now complete, and placed the tarnished silver bracelet upon her own wrist, completing the circle. <words>19</words>
The singing spirits resumed their lullaby, softer now, a requiem for the mortician who collected even herself. <words>17</words>
