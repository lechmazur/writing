Baron Kestrel, off-grid survivalist baron of the catacomb orchard where tree roots snake between bones, stands ankle-deep in luminous doubt as moonlight drips through the vaulted ceiling. <words>31</words>
In his gloved hand he cradles an empty bottle, its glass visibly obscure with centuries of cellar dust, and he wonders what message the void inside might still be waiting to send. <words>37</words>
The raft he built from coffin lids and prayer planks creaks against the stone lip of the underground river, and in the moment a homemade raft touches open water he feels the orchard exhale like a lung. <words>38</words>
He kneels, fingers moving in the silent communication of sign language, sketching memories of frost patterns and blossom dates into the air for the dead to read. <words>30</words>
They answer with the slow grind of shifting femurs, a code he has studied since boyhood, and together they unearth a narrow lead box buried beneath the oldest apple root. <words>33</words>
Inside the box lies a second empty bottle, twin to his own, sealed with wax the color of winter stars. <words>23</words>
He uncorks it, and the scent of last autumn’s cider rises, distilled into a single breath that makes the luminous doubt in his chest flare brighter. <words>29</words>
Baron Kestrel understands now that the orchard archives seasonal changes not in ink but in absence, each bottle a negative space preserving the shape of what once filled it. <words>34</words>
He sets both bottles upright on the raft, their mouths open to the dripping ceiling, and begins to sign again, slower, describing the taste of this year’s first snow. <words>32</words>
The bones rustle approval; a knucklebone rolls into the water and floats like a tiny lantern. <words>19</words>
He pushes off, and the raft glides between pillars of petrified fruit, each trunk wrapped in vertebrae like necklaces. <words>24</words>
Where the lantern bone drifts, the water glows, revealing murals painted on submerged skulls—harvest moons, equinox fires, the spiral of a single leaf falling. <words>29</words>
Baron Kestrel adds his own reflection to the archive, letting the luminous doubt ripple across the surface so the unknown may study him in return. <words>27</words>
At the far end of the catacomb, a root lifts like a beckoning arm; he steers toward it, bottles clinking softly, ready to bury one and keep the other, continuing the orchard’s quiet conversation with time. <words>37</words>
As the raft slips into darkness, the orchard begins to bloom overhead, white petals drifting down like apologies, and he knows the next season will taste of this exact moment of leaving. <words>34</words>
