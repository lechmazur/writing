The end of history witness stepped through the archway of the ancient temple library lost in time, her boots silent on the tessellated floor that remembered every footfall that had never happened. [34]  
A resounding hush pressed against her eardrums like the pause between heartbeats. [45]  
She carried a softcover dictionary whose pages had surrendered their ink to entropy, yet still smelled faintly of cedar and ozone. [63]  
Across a universe's hiccup—an instant when expansion coughed and galaxies stuttered—she had been chosen to watch the final syllable of existence be written. [88]  
The dictionary quivered, sensing its own obsolescence, and she opened it to the word "unify," the only entry not yet erased. [108]  
Spiral arbitration, the method by which cosmos judged itself, shimmered in the air like heat above a dying star. [127]  
She understood then that to unravel cosmic illusions she must practice the paradox of journeying inward while walking out. [149]  
Each aisle between the shelves curved into itself, Möbius corridors of parchment and dust. [166]  
She wandered them, wanderingly exact, counting breaths that belonged to no calendar. [182]  
The dictionary grew lighter with every step, as though definitions were evaporating into her bloodstream. [201]  
She passed a codex whose spine read "Future Perfect," its pages blank because the tense had collapsed. [221]  
At the center of the library stood a lectern carved from petrified dawn; upon it lay a quill made of vacuum. [242]  
She set the dictionary beneath the quill, aligning the word "unify" with the nib that dripped silence. [261]  
Spiral arbitration tightened, coils of luminous jurisprudence spiraling down from the vaulted ceiling. [280]  
The witness felt the universe's hiccup repeat, a skipped beat in the heart of space-time. [296]  
She pressed her palm to the lectern; the wood was warm, as if it still remembered the sun it once was. [316]  
Memories not her own flooded her: every librarian who had ever sworn to shelve the infinite. [335]  
They whispered that the last illusion was the belief in separation. [348]  
To honor them, she began to walk outward, following the spiral's widening gyre. [364]  
With each step she recited the dictionary's vanishing words, letting them dissolve on her tongue like snowflakes of meaning. [385]  
The shelves receded, yet the library did not shrink; instead, the distance between things became negotiable. [405]  
She felt herself fragmenting into narrative possibilities, yet the dictionary anchored her, its soft cover a skin she refused to shed. [428]  
Spiral arbitration judged her progress by the hush, measuring the weight of unsounded syllables. [447]  
At the outermost coil she found a mirror framed in event horizons; her reflection held the dictionary open to a page now entirely blank. [469]  
She understood the final illusion: the witness and the witnessed were the same. [485]  
She pressed the dictionary to the mirror; paper and glass merged, a softcover portal. [500]  
Through it she stepped, journeying inward while walking out, the spiral folding until its center was everywhere. [521]  
The library exhaled, shelves collapsing into sentences that orbited her like fireflies of forgotten alphabets. [541]  
She stood in the void that was also the library's heart, the dictionary now a pulse in her hand. [559]  
Spiral arbitration pronounced its verdict: the cosmos was innocent of division. [574]  
The universe's hiccup ended; galaxies resumed their outward drift, but she heard the resounding hush inside every star. [594]  
She opened the dictionary one last time; the word "unify" had become a single dot, a black hole of meaning. [614]  
She swallowed the dot, and the ancient temple library folded into her chest like a paper bird returning home. [633]  
Across the renewed continuum, she walked, carrying the hush, the spiral, and the softcover dictionary that now contained everything and nothing. [656]  
Wherever she stepped, illusions unraveled like scarves in warm wind, and strangers paused, feeling briefly whole. [676]  
She was the end of history witness no longer; she was the librarian of the beginning. [694]  
And in the resounding hush that followed every word, the cosmos read itself aloud, forever, wanderingly exact. [714]
