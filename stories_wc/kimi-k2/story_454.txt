At the spot where the map tears, dividing known from unknown, reckless smuggler Lira Voss stands before the haunted amusement park funhouse entrance clutching a pressed four-leaf clover in glass like a talisman against her own heartbeat. <words>41</words>
The clover once belonged to Juno, the distant companion whose laughter still syncs with Lira's pulse across light-years, and tonight Lira will dramatize her loyalty to the outsider group called the Fringe by stealing the funhouse's rumored starlight core. <words>46</words>
She is rationally emotional, calculating every risk yet unable to stop the tears that taste like carnival sugar as she sets the synchronized watch alarms she and Juno programmed before exile—three sharp beeps at 23:59 to signal success or surrender. <words>46</words>
The funhouse doors yawn open with a jubilant despair, calliope music warped into funeral march tempo, and Lira steps through the cotton-candy haze knowing the Fringe watches from the shadows, judging whether a lone smuggler deserves their constellation-wide family. <words>45</words>
Mirrors fracture her reflection into a kaleidoscope of regrets: here she is kissing Juno goodbye, here she is smuggling medicine to orphans, here she is running from every place that tried to love her. <words>38</words>
At the hall of whispers, animatronic clowns chant her failures in Juno's voice, but Lira presses the glass clover to her lips and keeps moving, because acceptance is a heavier cargo than contraband and she has never dropped a shipment yet. <words>45</words>
The alarms on her wrist and Juno's distant wrist vibrate in perfect synchronicity—beep, beep, beep—cutting through the funhouse's psychic noise like a lifeline thrown across the void. <words>35</words>
She finds the starlight core disguised as a cracked fortune-teller machine, its glass orb pulsing with captive galaxies, and as she pries it free the funhouse shrieks, walls collapsing into starfields that reveal the Fringe's hidden observation deck. <words>42</words>
Lira holds the core overhead, her silhouette framed by dying neon, and dramatizes her triumph with a pirouette learned from Juno during zero-gravity dances in cargo holds, offering the universe's stolen heart to the silent judges. <words>40</words>
The Fringe leader steps forward, mask reflecting Lira's tear-streaked grin, and speaks the words she has chased across parsecs: "Welcome home, smuggler." <words>28</words>
Behind the mask, Juno's eyes shine—rationally emotional, impossibly present—and Lira understands the real heist was never the starlight but the proof that distance cannot sever synchronized souls. <words>37</words>
Together they walk out of the collapsing funhouse, alarms still chiming in harmony, carrying the clover and the core and the fragile, jubilant despair of finally being seen. <words>34</words>
