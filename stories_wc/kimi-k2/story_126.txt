The merchant, once proud of spice-laden hulls, now drifted through the ghost station's corridors like a rumor of himself, pockets rattling with nothing but salt. <words>29</words>
He had been shipwrecked here after the last tree fell, when the orbital forests burned and the station's oxygen recyclers sighed their final green breath. <words>25</words>
On the observation deck, starlight poured over abandoned telescopes and a single rustic butter churn someone had lugged up from a forgotten colony fair. <words>23</words>
He touched its paddles, honestly strange in this chrome cathedral, and felt rebellious sparks skitter across his frost-numbed fingertips. <words>20</words>
They were memories of churning cream on a porch that no longer existed, memories that refused to orbit the empire's tidy narrative of progress. <words>23</words>
The deck's main screen still flickered with a travel poster: sapphire seas, white beaches, a slogan promising Return to Eden. <words>19</words>
Its edges flaked like old paint, curling away from the lie it sold. <words>12</words>
He needed to ascend, not toward heaven but through illusion itself, to shatter the grand illusion that had scorched forests into currency. <words>24</words>
So he gripped the churn's handle, wedged his boots against the deck's magnetic strips, and began to climb via the flaking edges of the travel poster in the ghost station. <words>31</words>
Each flake he tore free became a rebellious spark, drifting upward with aloof passion, refusing the station's artificial gravity. <words>20</words>
Higher, past shattered constellations of glass, past the observation dome where tourists once pressed faces to watch planets die in real time. <words>23</words>
The merchant remembered bargaining for saplings on Ganymede, promising they would grow into cathedral shade, then selling the same seedlings three ports later as antiques. <words>27</words>
Guilt tasted metallic now, like recycled air and regret. <words>9</words>
At the apex, where the poster's last corner clung to the bulkhead, he stood upon the butter churn like a deranged prophet. <words>22</words>
Below, the deck stretched empty, a stage after the audience has vanished. <words>12</words>
He raised the churn overhead; its paddles caught starlight, scattering rebellious sparks into the void. <words>17</words>
In that moment the grand illusion crackedâ€”not with thunder, but with the soft sigh of a tree falling in a forest no microphone would ever record. <words>27</words>
The station's lights dimmed, acknowledging defeat. <words>7</words>
He let the churn fall; it spun slowly, dispensing the last honest milk of memory into the dark. <words>18</words>
Then he stepped off the edge, not to die, but to drift among the sparks he had freed, aloof yet burning. <words>21</words>
Somewhere, a seed uncurled in vacuum, stubborn as rebellion. <words>10</words>
