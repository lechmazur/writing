The lonesome minstrel tuned his silver-stringed lute on the rooftop horse stables of Neo-Kyoto Tower, where steam from the coffee lines below curled up like question marks. <words>29</words>
He pressed the rubber stamp—its image unclear, worn to a ghost of ink—against the stable wall, leaving only a faint circle that might have been a sun or a mouth. <words>25</words>
Every morning at 7:03, amid coffee lines that snaked through the neon canyon, he tracked cloud patterns to settle the inherited rivalries between his bloodline and the silent cosmos. <words>27</words>
His grandfather had sworn the sky itself bickered with their clan, hiding messages in cirrus script; the minstrel, last of the line, now read those messages by the bizarrely typical method of humming minor thirds at passing nimbostratus. <words>34</words>
The horses—genetically bred for altitude—watched with liquid eyes as he stamped the feed bins, the unclear image smudging oats into prophecies. <words>22</words>
Today the clouds formed a perfect chessboard, and he recognized the opening gambit of the century-old feud: a pawn-shaped cumulus advancing toward his rook of solitude. <words>26</words>
He bickered aloud, voice soft as elevator jazz, arguing that the cosmos had no right to move first when it refused to speak. <words>21</words>
A barista drone hovered up the side of the tower, delivering a cup marked with the same unclear stamp; the minstrel sipped, tasting cardamom and déjà vu. <words>25</words>
Steam from the coffee rose to join the clouds, and in that merging he saw the mundane enchantment his grandfather had promised: ordinary steam becoming oracle, ordinary sky becoming adversary. <words>27</words>
He played a chord that made the horses stamp in Morse, hooves tapping inherited rivalries into the reinforced roof: dot-dot-dash for forgiveness, dash-dash-dot for defiance. <words>27</words>
The clouds shifted, forming the blurred image of the stamp—a circle that was also a zero, a mouth, a planet—confirming the feud would end only when he stamped the sky itself. <words>28</words>
He dipped the rubber stamp into his coffee, ink blooming like a dark star, and pressed it against the wind; the image remained unclear, but the cosmos flinched, a sudden hole in the cirrus where his mark should have been. <words>32</words>
The horses whinnied in harmony, a chord of mundane enchantment that turned the coffee lines below into a congregation humming his melody. <words>21</words>
He understood then: to read the silent cosmos was not to win the argument but to keep bickering beautifully, to stamp the sky with questions until the questions became stars. <words>29</words>
As the sun set over the metropolis, the minstrel played on, his lute strings vibrating with the same frequency as the tower’s anti-grav engines, a lullaby for inherited rivalries and the bizarrely typical heart that carried them. <words>35</words>
The clouds, defeated by music, spelled out a single word in vapor: listen. <words>13</words>
He stamped the air once more, and this time the image was clear—a circle closing, a mouth opening, a cosmos finally speaking back in the hush between coffee orders. <words>29</words>
