The contrite swordsman, Sir Regret-of-the-Seven-Blades, adjusted his cracked monocle and tried not to look hypnotically rigid while the masseuse on the floating island spa kneaded guilt knots the size of cannonballs from his shoulders. <words>37</words>
In the hush where hope takes root, between the gong of the sunset gong and the giggle of the steam valves, he whispered his mission: to unmask the pretender to the throne who lounged somewhere among the cucumber-eyed aristocrats. <words>46</words>
The pretender, rumor said, wore loyalty tattooed on his skin like a royal tapestry, but the ink was cryptic, shifting, and only a careful yarn could coax it into betrayal. <words>34</words>
Regret had come armed with nothing sharper than politeness, determined to be freed by kindness rather than freed by stabbing, though his left hand still twitched toward absent hilts whenever someone laughed too imperially. <words>38</words>
He began by complimenting Lord Featherbonnet’s mustache, which was so waxed it could slice bread, then offered to unravel the lord’s sleeve tattoos “for relaxation purposes,” humming a lullaby that sounded suspiciously like a confession spell. <words>39</words>
The ink wriggled, forming tiny crowns that melted into question marks; Featherbonnet giggled, “How delightfully hypnotic,” and promptly fell asleep, proving himself merely vain, not treasonous. <words>32</words>
Undeterred, Regret moved to the mud baths, where Duchess Glimmergut floated like a pickled pearl, her back inked with constellations that rearranged themselves into the royal sigil when steamed. <words>34</words>
He spun a yarn about a lost prince who loved spa days, and as he spoke he tugged the threads of her tattoos with the edge of his monocle, the crack splitting wider like a grin. <words>34</words>
The constellations coalesced into a portrait of the true heir—Regret’s own baby face, albeit with fewer regrets—revealing the duchess as the pretender’s accomplice rather than the pretender herself. <words>34</words>
She shrieked, flinging seaweed like accusations, and the spa’s harmony wobbled; attendants rushed in wielding loofahs like truncheons, creating a scene of humorous unease that smelled of eucalyptus and panic. <words>34</words>
Regret bowed, apologizing for the disturbance, and offered to pay everyone’s bill with the gold he’d saved by not buying new swords, an act so disarmingly kind that the duchess’s anger deflated into embarrassed hiccups. <words>38</words>
At last he found the real pretender: the spa’s towel boy, whose ankles bore tiny crowns hidden beneath rolled socks, tattoos so shy they only appeared when he felt safe. <words>32</words>
Instead of exposing him, Regret knelt, handed over the cracked monocle as a token of trust, and said, “Rule gently, or I’ll come back with sharper kindness.” <words>30</words>
The boy laughed, the island drifted into starlight, and Regret walked off the gangway lighter, his tattoos—once maps of vengeance—now unraveling into plain skin, freed by the kindness he’d finally shown himself. <words>38</words>
