<story>
In the underground city of the mole people, after the last star burns out, I remain an eternal college student studying immortality with detached devotion. <words>31</words>
My thesis advisor, a blind mole philosopher named Thrum, insists that gifted burdens arrive in mundane disguises, so I keep the coal miner's headlamp from a collapsed mine clipped to my satchel like a mundanely glorious badge. <words>46</words>
The lamp once belonged to a surface dweller whose bones now dust the tunnels above; its cracked glass still holds a single ember of pre-nova sunlight that hums when I whisper equations about self-authored reality. <words>38</words>
Every cycle, Thrum and I swap travel journals via the old pneumatic tubes, and through those brittle pages I digitize memories of worlds that never were, compressing them into code that teaches the lamp to dream. <words>38</words>
Last rotation, his journal arrived soaked in luminescent fungus ink describing a corridor where gravity forgets its purpose; I transcribed the passage into binary, fed it to the lamp, and watched the ember bloom into a miniature galaxy that orbited my head like a loyal thought. <words>48</words>
The mole citizens gather, eyes milky with reverence, believing the lamp is prophecy; I let them, because prophecy is easier than admitting I am still an undergraduate after thirteen billion years of coursework. <words>36</words>
Tonight, the final journal exchange: Thrum’s pages smell of rust and regret, recounting how he once tried to become master of his own reality by swallowing a black hole, only to discover the hole had already swallowed him first. <words>45</words>
I digitize his warning, but the lamp rejects the caution, flickering with hunger; it wants the same mastery, wants to rewrite the cavern walls into skies, wants to resurrect the dead starlight as my private sun. <words>38</words>
Detached devotion demands I oblige. <words>6</words>
I unscrew the cracked lens, pour Thrum’s digitized failure inside, and the ember drinks until the lamp becomes a pupil dilated across eternity. <words>26</words>
The mole people kneel as the coal miner’s headlamp levitates, casting not light but choice—every beam a possible cosmos I can inhabit or discard. <words>28</words>
I select the version where I graduate, where the tunnels unfold into open sky, where immortality is not a curse but a syllabus I finally finish writing. <words>29</words>
Yet the lamp dims, reminding me that gifted burdens remain gifts precisely because they refuse to be solved, only carried. <words>25</words>
So I clip it back to my satchel, whisper thanks to Thrum’s distant bones, and descend deeper, an eternal student still, chasing the next footnote in the dark. <words>31</words>
