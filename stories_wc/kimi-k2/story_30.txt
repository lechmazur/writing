In the navigation room of the star-caravel *Sacred Disorder*, amid whispered secrets of solar winds and phantom fleets, the high-stakes gambler known only as Dice stood before a cracked viewport, telekinetically rolling a pair of ivory cubes that never touched the deck. <words>42</words>
Each die spun like a miniature planet, obeying the invisible gravity of his mind, while the fragment of medieval tapestry—its dragons stitched in thread now older than Earth itself—hung above the console like a relic of lost languages no throat could pronounce. <words>38</words>
Dice was philosophically practical: he believed luck was merely physics wearing a mask, and that every wager was a negotiation with entropy, yet tonight he gambled for seeds, not coin. <words>30</words>
The pirates wanted star-charts; he wanted the cryo-vault of ancestral grain locked in their hold, the last unmodified cultivars that could still grow in honest soil. <words>28</words>
His grandmother had taught him the family tradition: plant a tree for every new soul, so roots would remember names when tongues forgot. <words>25</words>
But the vault orbited a dead moon, guarded by men who spoke in ciphered clicks and flame-scarred hulls, and Dice had only one currency left—his gift. <words>27</words>
He whispered to the dice, not in prayer but in calculation, and they answered by settling on seven, the sacred disorder of creation. <words>22</words>
The tapestry dragons seemed to exhale; threads shimmered, spelling out syllables of a language that had died with the last plow-horse on Europa. <words>25</words>
Dice touched the fragment, felt the heat of forgotten hearths, and understood: the dragons were not beasts but phonemes, each scale a letter in the grammar of cultivation. <words>27</words>
With a flick of thought, he flung the dice toward the vault’s lock; they ignited midair, not with fire but with meaning, branding the code of barley and rye into the metal. <words>29</words>
The door sighed open, revealing cryo-caskets labeled in the same lost tongue, seeds dreaming of rain. <words>18</words>
Pirate alarms howled like damned choirs, yet Dice moved calmly, loading the vault into a shuttle already sprouting a sapling in its hydro-pod—his unborn child’s tree. <words>28</words>
As plasma bolts traced arcs outside, he pressed the tapestry to his chest, letting the dragons speak their final word: a lullaby for soil, for seasons, for the slow patience of farmers. <words>30</words>
The shuttle launched through sacred disorder, dice orbiting it like twin moons, while behind him the pirate ship bloomed into silent flame, a funeral pyre for those who had forgotten how to grow anything but fear. <words>34</words>
Later, on a quiet asteroid seeded with black loam, Dice planted the first stalks and the second tree, teaching the leaves the pronunciation of rain in a language no longer lost. <words>30</words>
