The ivy-choked clock above the disused railway station had stopped at 11:47, the exact minute the last train left and the town’s loneliness began to bloom. [34]  
Below the frozen hands, Mara Finch—elusive disaster-relief logistician, veteran of floods and famines, now AWOL from every agency—balanced on the cracked ticket counter, juggling three dented teacups and a fragment of moon rock no larger than a cough drop. [64]  
She addressed the empty benches with desperately jocular courtesy: “Ladies, gentlemen, and itinerant ghosts, today’s service is delayed by cosmic debris; please retain your tickets for the afterlife.” [82]  
The moon rock glinted like a wink, and she tucked it into the pocket nearest her heart, where it pressed against a folded list of coordinates she had never dared to visit. [104]  
Mara had come to the station because rumor—improbable, whispered through grocery queues and static-laden radios—claimed the place was a node where loneliness could be bartered away, provided one offered something the sky had already lost. [132]  
Reciprocity, the rumor insisted, was the only fare accepted on the invisible line that still ran beneath the buckled rails. [148]  
She had spent years shipping grain and antibiotics to strangers, tallying every crate as a debt against her own solitude, but the balance sheet in her chest remained blood-red. [172]  
Tonight, polite anarchy reigned: wind rattled the ivy like polite applause, and somewhere a signal bell rang though no wire moved. [190]  
Mara set the moon rock on the rusted weighing scale once used for mailbags; the needle swung wildly, then settled on the single word “Enough.” [210]  
A fox slipped through a broken window, fur jeweled with seeds, and regarded her with the solemnity of a stationmaster. [228]  
“Evening, courier,” Mara said, bowing. [235]  
The fox opened its mouth and spoke in the voice of Mrs. Alder, the grocer who had first told Mara the rumor: “To catalyze the cure, you must send the stone farther than you can follow, and trust the chain of improbable mouths that will pass it on.” [268]  
Mara laughed, the sound brittle but genuine. [276]  
“Trust gossip to save me? That’s like asking a tornado to alphabetize my regrets.” [292]  
Still, she wrapped the fragment in a page torn from her own ledger—where every delivered relief shipment was listed—and tied it with string from the last parcel she had ever mailed to herself. [320]  
She placed the bundle on the track’s center, where moonlight pooled like spilled milk. [335]  
The fox nudged it with a paw, and the rails began to hum, though no train approached. [349]  
From the ivy, a parliament of sparrows descended, each carrying a single silver pin; they formed a shifting map in the dust, arrows pointing south-west. [370]  
Mara traced the pattern, recognizing the coordinates she had never visited: a village erased from maps by a landslide the year she was born. [392]  
“So the debt travels backward,” she murmured. [399]  
The fox nodded. [402]  
“Reciprocity isn’t a circle,” it said, “it’s a spiral; what you give returns at a different time, wearing a stranger’s face.” [422]  
Mara felt the ledger page flutter, though there was no wind; the ink rearranged itself into a new list—names of people who would next handle the stone, each entry accompanied by a loneliness quotient measured in heartbeats per hour. [452]  
She tore the page free and tucked it into the fox’s collar. [463]  
“Tell them to laugh when they pass it on,” she instructed. [474]  
“Desperately, politely, and with anarchy,” the fox agreed, and vanished into the ivy. [488]  
The station sighed; the clock hands twitched, advancing one minute to 11:48. [500]  
Mara sat on the bench where the fox had been, feeling the absence of the moon rock like a pulled tooth. [518]  
Yet the cavity was warm, as if a small sun had taken residence. [530]  
She listened to the rails, which now carried a faint chorus of voices—some laughing, some crying, all trading the stone farther and farther away. [550]  
Each voice left a breadcrumb of belonging in her ear. [560]  
When the story changes, the rumor chains would loop back, and someone she had never met would arrive carrying a fragment of something she had once lost—perhaps a childhood marble, perhaps the echo of her
