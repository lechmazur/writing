Sentimental shepherd Enlil wiped desert dust from the antique hairpin he had bartered for three ewes, feeling its carved lapis catch torchlight inside the ancient Sumerian palace. <words>28</words>
The palace, long abandoned to sand and silence, trembled as an anchor lifted for a ship’s maiden voyage somewhere far downriver, the sound rolling through broken cedar beams like a drumbeat of departure. <words>42</words>
Enlil, habitually spontaneous, had followed a set of coordinates scratched on a clay shard by a dying judge who swore the hairpin once pinned the veil of a queen who vanished the night laws were first written. <words>63</words>
He pressed the pin to his lips, tasting salt and regret, then boasted to the empty throne room, “I will trade this trinket for the price of justice itself, though it cost me every lamb I ever loved.” <words>85</words>
Wind answered, whipping tapestries into ghosts; he welcomed chaos as a teacher and stepped deeper into the dark, sandals slapping wet stone where irrigation once sang. <words>105</words>
At the throne’s foot, a fresh reed mat waited, and on it another shard: more coordinates, deeper inside the labyrinth, signed only with the cuneiform for “balance.” <words>125</words>
Enlil laughed, the sound cracked and humble, admitting he was lost yet certain; he tucked the hairpin behind his ear like a shepherd’s crook and ran. <words>145</words>
Corridors spiraled; murals of judgment blurred past—gods weighing hearts against feathers, kings paying debts with children’s tears—until he burst into a courtyard open to the star-drunk sky. <words>168</words>
There, a circle of hooded figures stood around a bronze scale; one extended a hand, palm up, wordless. <words>183</words>
Enlil’s habitually spontaneous heart lurched, but he knelt, offering the antique hairpin, its gold warm from his skin. <words>199</words>
The hooded judge set it against a single black feather; the scale shrieked, tipping wildly, scattering starlight like grain. <words>216</words>
“Justice is not balanced,” the judge whispered, voice dry riverbed. “It is fed.” <words>229</words>
From the shadows, the shepherd’s own flock emerged, bleating, eyes reflecting torch fire; behind them, the ghost-queen, veil pinned by the very hairpin now on the scale. <words>252</words>
Enlil understood: to pay the price, he must choose—his sheep, his memories, or the law that would devour both. <words>270</words>
Chaotic humility flooded him; he bowed, tears watering the cracked earth, and whispered, “Take my boast, not my flock.” <words>289</words>
The scale steadied; the hairpin dissolved into lapis dust that swirled into the queen’s empty eyes, filling them with living sorrow. <words>308</words>
She nodded once, and the hooded court vanished, leaving only the shepherd, the sheep, and dawn wind carrying the distant cheer of the departing ship. <words>330</words>
Enlil herded his flock back through the palace, past murals now showing a shepherd trading pride for mercy, the price of justice etched beneath in fresh clay: “Chaos teaches best when we admit we are small.” <words>365</words>
Outside, sand had shifted; new grass poked through stone, and he laughed again, softer, pinning a sprig behind his ear where the hairpin once lay, a spontaneous promise to remember the lesson every time the anchor of memory lifted. <words>410</words>
