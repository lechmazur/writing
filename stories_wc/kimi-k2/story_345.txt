Father Aldric, lapsed priest and unapologetically confused penitent, clutched the abacus with missing beads like a rosary whose prayers had slipped away. <words>25</words>
Through the hush of fate unraveling, he jogged beneath the labyrinth orchard of giant bean stalks reaching the clouds, their dull radiance pulsing like dying halos. <words>35</words>
Each footfall followed snow patterns that spiraled across the frozen loam, a map drawn by whatever wind mocked predestination. <words>45</words>
He had once preached that every soul was numbered, yet the abacus in his frost-numbed hands now counted only absence, the price of complacency tallied in hollow sockets where certainty used to click. <words>58</words>
Aldric remembered the village he abandoned after the drought sermon, when he told the starving to trust the harvest they could not see; their silence still rang louder than any bell. <words>71</words>
The stalks creaked overhead, bean pods heavy as cathedral bells, and he wondered if climbing might return him to grace or merely reveal another empty balcony in the sky. <words>84</words>
Snowflakes melted on his tongue like communion wafers that refused transubstantiation, leaving only water and doubt. <words>94</words>
He jogged harder, following a fresh braid of prints that resembled his own boots yet could not be, because no one else was ordained to trespass here. <words>106</words>
At a fork where three stalks twisted into a knot, the snow pattern spelled a question mark; Aldric laughed, the sound brittle as the abacus beads he once shattered in a rage of unanswered prayers. <words>120</words>
He pressed the wooden frame to his ear, hearing the wind pass through its vacant channels like breath through a confessional screen. <words>131</words>
Somewhere above, a pod split open with a sigh, releasing a single black bean that fell past his face, trailing a thread of cloud like a reversed ascension. <words>144</words>
Aldric caught it, felt it pulse with the same dull radiance that coated the stalks, and understood it was not food but a seed of consequence. <words>156</words>
He planted it in the center of the question mark, kneeling, jogging in place to keep blood moving, refusing stillness that might calcify into fate. <words>168</words>
The ground trembled; a new stalk erupted, thinner, faster, spiraling counterclockwise against the grain of the orchard. <words>179</words>
Aldric climbed, no longer jogging but ascending, the abacus clacking against the vine as if counting each rung away from the man he had been. <words>191</words>
Clouds parted, revealing not heaven but a mirror of the labyrinth below, yet in it he saw no reflection, only the snow pattern continuing across an empty sky. <words>204</words>
He stepped off the stalk onto that airy path, feet finding purchase on nothing, and realized the price of complacency was the illusion that paths were given rather than made. <words>218</words>
Behind him, the new stalk withered, its purpose served; ahead, the snow patterns dissolved into open white, inviting the first unmapped print. <words>230</words>
Aldric pocketed the abacus, its remaining beads rattling like dice, and walked forward, no longer priest, no longer penitent, merely a man stepping beyond fate's design into the hush that follows every unraveling. <words>245</words>
