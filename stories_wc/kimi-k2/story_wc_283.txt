The hourglass turner arrived at the amber warehouse beneath the cliffs just as the sun bled into the stone, its last rays caught like insects in the resinous walls. [34]  
Inside, shelves rose like petrified waves, each tier glowing with buttons—mother-of-pearl, bone, tin, and glass—sorted by the quiet discipline of decades. [50]  
She carried a single jar, no larger than a heart, sealed with wax the color of old parchment; within it trembled a canyon echo, a ribbon of sound stolen from a place where wind once carved prophecies into stone. [71]  
Her task, whispered by the dying keeper who had trained her, was to spin that prophecy into raw possibility before the echo faded at dawn. [87]  
The warehouse smelled of heated sap and distant storms, an unearthed silence that made every footstep feel like trespass. [102]  
She set the jar on a reading table of petrified pine, then began to unscramble the prophecy by cataloging lost buttons, believing each disc held a syllable of the canyon’s forgotten sentence. [123]  
First came a brass uniform button, verdigris blooming across its eagle; she placed it in the circle of sunrise hues, hearing the echo inside the jar shiver like a struck bell. [144]  
Next, a chipped porcelain rose from a child’s coat; she set it opposite, and the echo lengthened, almost forming the word “return.” [160]  
Hour after hour, as the truth unravels in the hush between breaths, she moved through the warehouse, guided by memory and the faint tug of sound against glass. [180]  
She found a cracked obsidian coat toggle that had once fastened a judge’s robe; when it joined the pattern, the echo spilled a phrase: “The cliffs remember every name they have taken.” [205]  
Her fingers, stained amber by years of turning sand, worked without hurry, quietly inspired by the notion that wisdom is never owned, only shared in fragments small enough to slip through time’s neck. [229]  
She lined up twenty-three buttons, then thirty, each a bead in a rosary of lost stories, and the jar began to glow, the echo condensing into a single thread of human longing. [252]  
At the stroke of warehouse midnight—marked by the cooling of the amber walls—she lifted the jar, uncorked it, and the canyon echo poured out, not as sound but as light, weaving itself through the button constellation. [278]  
Images rose: a girl dropping a blue enamel button into a stream, a soldier sewing a pewter one back onto a sleeve before a last charge, a grandmother polishing a jet mourning button while telling her grandson about the cliffs that sang. [309]  
The hourglass turner saw that every button had once fastened someone to the world; now they fastened the prophecy to her. [328]  
The echo shaped itself into a spiral, tightening until it became a spindle of raw possibility, humming with choices not yet made. [346]  
She understood then that the prophecy was not a sentence but a question: “What will you weave from what remains?” [364]  
She answered by removing the smallest button—a seed pearl from a wedding gown—and pressing it into the spindle’s heart. [382]  
Light flared, gentle as dawn through honey, and the amber warehouse sighed, walls softening until they resembled warm wax ready for new fingerprints. [403]  
The spindle dissolved into motes that drifted upward, settling onto the upper shelves where empty spaces waited. [420]  
Each mote became a button yet to be lost, a future story waiting for its owner, and the hourglass turner felt the shared wisdom pass through her like a tide returning to sea. [447]  
She left the jar open on the table; inside, only silence remained, but it was the kind that invites listening rather than fear. [467]  
Outside, the cliffs had shifted, their faces smoother, as if they too had released a burden. [482]  
She stepped into the pre-dawn chill, pockets rattling with three spare buttons she had not placed—insurance against forgetting. [500]  
Behind her, the warehouse doors closed without sound, sealing the unearthed silence back into amber. [517]  
She walked the path along the canyon rim, turning the hourglass she wore at her hip; the sand inside now ran upward, defying gravity, measuring possibility instead of loss. [543]  
At the first hint of sunrise, she scattered the three buttons over the edge; they fell like faint stars, and somewhere far below a new echo began, already shaped like a question. [569]  
She smiled, quietly inspired, knowing the next turner would arrive when the cliffs were ready to speak again. [588]
