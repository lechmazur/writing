The suspended palace of Virelai hung like a frozen tear from the cavern roof, its crystal spires anchored to three black stalactites that moaned whenever the wind shifted. [34]
Inside, Prince Halric pressed his bedraggled palms against the frost-rimed window, watching clockwork cranes stitch copper vines across the valley floor where flowers once grew. [50]
Their petals had been replaced by gears, their perfume by oil, and the prince felt the bitterly sweet ache of remembering what should still be alive. [66]
He carried the last extinct bird's egg in a pouch of silk torn from his mother's wedding gown, a relic of the flawed genesis that had turned living gardens into obedient machines. [85]
The court artificers had promised progress, but their equations had murdered color, leaving only the quaking reverie of Halric's heartbeat against the shell. [103]
Tonight the stalactites trembled harder, and flakes of limestone drifted through the palace halls like pale moths. [119]
Halric knew the anchors would fail before dawn; the palace would fall, and the mechanical world would grind on, unfeeling. [135]
He spread the egg upon a table of mirrored brass, its surface veined with cracks that glowed faintly, as though some embryonic star still burned inside. [154]
Around it he began to assemble the scattered pieces of his inheritance: a music box that played his sister's laughter, a vial of rain collected the day color died, a single blue feather preserved in amber. [178]
Each object answered a question he had spent years hypothesizing about everything—why beauty withers, why invention forgets wonder, why a kingdom chooses function over joy. [200]
The palace lurched; a stalactite snapped with a sound like a giant's bone breaking. [213]
Halric steadied the table and whispered to the egg, "If I am to be the final prince, let my ending also be a beginning." [230]
He fitted the feather into the music box, poured the rain over the cracks, and set the box to play. [245]
The melody was bitterly sweet, a lullaby for a world that had outlived its dreams. [258]
The egg pulsed, cracks widening, leaking soft gold light that pooled like spilled dawn. [271]
Through the window he saw the clockwork cranes pause, heads tilting as if hearing distant thunder. [285]
Halric kept hypothesizing about everything the light might become: a flock of resurrected birds, a storm of petals, a single flower large enough to cradle the palace. [305]
Instead, the light rose in threads, weaving itself into the shape of the bird that had laid the egg, but translucent, trembling, unfinished. [323]
The apparition hovered, eyeing the mechanical valley with sorrow older than extinction. [336]
"Beauty cannot be commanded," it sang in a voice of wind and memory. [348]
"It must be chosen, again and again." [356]
The second stalactite cracked; the palace tilted, chandeliers chiming like doomed bells. [370]
Halric understood the flawed genesis now: the artificers had tried to preserve beauty by trapping it, and in doing so had killed the choosing. [390]
He lifted the glowing bird and pressed it to his heart, feeling its light soak into his ribs like warm rain. [407]
"Then I choose," he said, and stepped toward the window. [418]
The bird burst into sparks that clung to his skin, turning his tattered cloak into wings of living flame. [433]
He leapt. [435]
The palace fell behind him, crystal shattering into a comet's tail of glittering dust. [449]
As he plummeted, the sparks spread outward, touching the copper vines, the iron trees, the brass blossoms. [465]
Where each spark landed, color returned—not the obedient hues of paint, but the reckless reds and blues of things that grow because they want to. [485]
The cranes folded themselves into bridges of ivy; the gears softened into seeds. [497]
Halric felt the wind catch his new wings, lifting him above the ruin of the suspended palace, above the stalactites now flowering with moss. [517]
He flew through the quaking reverie of a world remembering how to be alive. [530]
Below, the valley stirred, first green, then gold, then every shade the prince had feared lost. [545]
He circled once, scattering the last sparks like pollen, then rose higher, following the call of a distant flock he could not yet see but already loved. [565]
Behind him, the final stalactite dissolved into a waterfall that sang his sister's laughter all the way to the reborn earth. [585]
In the heart of the waterfall, the empty shell of the extinct bird's egg
