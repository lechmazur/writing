In the drifting space debris art studio tethered to a derelict freighter, feisty stablehand Juno polished the antique oil lamp she’d salvaged from Earth’s last fairground. <words>29</words>
She wasn’t here for sculpture; she was here to preserve ancient methods of equine care, convinced horses would one day orbit again. <words>20</words>
The lamp’s brass felt warm, as though remembering stalls and straw instead of vacuum and starlight. <words>15</words>
Half-torn tickets from a forgotten carnival booth fluttered out of its spout—each strip inked with faded horses leaping through rings of fire. <words>22</words>
Juno, intellectually playful, laid the tickets in a circle on the magnetic workbench, wondering if the fragments still held a charge of wonder. <words>19</words>
When the freighter’s engines rumbled for another car ride between salvage yards, the tickets began to glow. <words>15</words>
They lifted, swirled, and pressed themselves against the lamp, which began to morph into a miniature carousel no bigger than her palm. <words>20</words>
Painted ponies spun on silver poles, their manes flickering like comet tails. <words>12</words>
Juno’s motivation sharpened: if the lamp could remember joy, she could remember how to keep living things alive in sterile space. <words>20</words>
She pocketed the carousel, slipped into the studio’s only car—a pressurized rover with cracked leather seats—and started the long ride toward the colony’s forgotten stables. <words>25</words>
Along the way, she rehearsed redemptive acts: coaxing frozen embryos, fermenting algae into hay, teaching foals to trust recycled air. <words>18</words>
The rover’s headlights caught drifting hull fragments shaped like rearing horses; the debris itself seemed to cheer her on. <words>17</words>
At the stables, she found only rusted gates and silence. <words>9</words>
She set the carousel on the floor; it grew, morphing again, until a full-sized ring of light circled the empty stalls. <words>18</words>
The half-torn tickets peeled off the lamp and attached themselves to the walls, becoming holographic mangers filled with golden feed. <words>19</words>
Juno whispered the old commands her grandmother taught her, voice quietly bold against the hum of life-support. <words>16</words>
Embryo canisters warmed; mechanical udders dripped colostrum; the scent of Earth hay, impossible yet true, drifted through vents. <words>19</words>
A foal flickered into existence, legs trembling like new constellations. <words>11</words>
Juno steadied it, feeling the lamp’s heat through her gloves, knowing the carousel would fade when the tickets burned out. <words>17</words>
She worked faster, teaching the foal to breathe recycled nitrogen, to trust the rhythm of artificial dawn. <words>16</words>
When the last ticket dissolved into sparks, the carousel shrank back into a lamp, its brass now etched with a single rearing horse. <words>19</words>
Juno hung the lamp above the stall, a quiet beacon. <words>9</words>
She stepped outside, the rover waiting for another car ride, another fragment of sky to turn into pasture. <words>16</words>
Redemptive acts, she realized, were not grand gestures but small, stubborn lights carried through darkness. <words>15</words>
