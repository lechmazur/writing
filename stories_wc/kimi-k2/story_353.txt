In the emergency time machine garage that had once been her grandmother’s bakery, Mira sifted moonlit flour and spoke to the pressed flowers wedged between gear-teeth like brittle bookmarks. <words>31</words>
They answered in hushed rustles, for this was the hour when shadows learn to speak, and their whispers carried the seeds of contagion that would unseat the tyrant who taxed every loaf. <words>37</words>
She was a small-town baker still, though now she kneaded futures instead of dough, her cynically gentle smile masking calculations sharper than any blade. <words>29</words>
Each night she tracked moon patterns across the oil-stained skylight, noting how the crescent slashed the dark like a fingernail clipping from a careless god. <words>28</words>
When the gibbous swelled, she fed the flowers—marigold, violet, feverfew—into the engine’s carburetor, letting their dormant spores warm and quicken. <words>27</words>
The machine coughed blue light that tasted of cardamom and rust; she stepped inside, palms dusted with pollen and regret, determined to exceed every failed rebellion that had come before. <words>30</words>
She landed three cycles back, the garage younger, the tyrant still a boy stealing bread from windowsills. <words>19</words>
Mira placed a single loaf beside him, its crust laced with the same spores sleeping in the flowers. <words>21</words>
Years compressed like folding dough; she watched the boy rise through ranks, the contagion blooming quietly in his blood until mercy felt like fever. <words>27</words>
On the night the moon grew perfectly round, she returned to the garage and found the tyrant already there, eyes wet with remembered kindness, crown askew. <words>28</words>
“I dreamed of your bread,” he said, voice soft as shadows learning their first syllables. <words>17</words>
She offered him another slice; he ate, tears salting the crust, and the contagion of compassion finished its slow work. <words>23</words>
He signed the decree that dethroned himself, then walked into the timestream, scattering marigold petals that took root in every year at once. <words>26</words>
The garage exhaled steam scented with yeast and ozone; Mira swept the remaining pressed flowers into a jar, knowing the next tyrant would need feeding too. <words>28</words>
Outside, the moon waned, and the shadows, having spoken, curled back into silence, their lesson seeded in every heart that would soon rise like well-proofed dough. <words>30</words>
She set tomorrow’s starter on the workbench, whispering thanks to the night, to the flowers, to the boy who learned to tax no more than his own remorse. <words>29</words>
In the hush between ticks of the chronometer, the bakery-garage glowed, a hearth where mystical reality proved softer than iron yet stronger than any crown. <words>27</words>
And somewhere down the timeline, a new tyrant paused at the scent of fresh bread, already feeling the first warm ache of change. <words>25</words>
