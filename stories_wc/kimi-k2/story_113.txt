In the xenon-lit tunnel beneath the abandoned station, the hesitant bard clutched his worn-out dinosaur plush like a talisman against the ticking of the year everyone would rather forget. <words>31</words>
He was shyly loud, his voice a cracked bell that rang only when no one was meant to hear, and tonight the tunnel answered back with ironic awe, echoing his half-sung elegies into metallic laughter. <words>44</words>
The plush, threadbare tail dragging across the glowing floor, had once belonged to a child who vanished when the clocks began to stutter, and its stuffing now carried the weight of every second that refused to stay put. <words>42</words>
At the crossing of the year, when calendars curled like burnt paper, the fragility of time felt less like philosophy and more like a frayed seam in the universe begging to be unpicked. <words>37</words>
The bard’s motivation was simple, impossible: to unravel a tapestry woven from sorrow, each knot a memory someone paid to forget, each thread humming with the name of the lost. <words>36</words>
He stepped into the dream-hopping machines, capsules of cobalt glass humming with neon lullabies, and the dinosaur plush was scanned as “emotional baggage,” which made the machine sigh in mechanical sympathy. <words>37</words>
Inside, synesthetic gears dripped lavender sparks, and the bard’s consciousness slid sideways, shyly loud again, now inside the dream of the station’s last janitor, who swept broken minutes into piles that dissolved before they could be bagged. <words>44</words>
He sang—not to entertain, but to motivate the janitor to remember the color of the child’s coat, the precise shade of orange that once outshone the xenon lights. <words>35</words>
The janitor wept quartz tears that turned into tiny clocks, each tick a promise to keep looking, and the bard pocketed one, feeling its pulse against the plush’s frayed belly. <words>35</words>
He hopped again, this time into the dream of the mayor who had ordered the tunnel sealed, and there the bard found a tapestry stitched from ticket stubs, each stamped with the same departing hour. <words>38</words>
With ironic awe, the bard realized the mayor had been trying to sew time shut, believing sorrow could be hemmed like a skirt, and he sang the lullaby backwards until the stitches loosened and the hour bled out like indigo ink. <words>41</words>
The dinosaur plush absorbed the ink, its glass eyes suddenly clear, reflecting the child waving from a platform that existed only between seconds. <words>29</words>
One last hop carried the bard into his own dream, where the tunnel stretched into a throat of light and the tapestry unraveled into a river of names flowing toward morning. <words>34</words>
He stepped out of the machine at the first chime of the new year nobody wanted, the xenon lights dimming to candle-soft, and the worn-out dinosaur plush now beat like a second heart in his arms. <words>38</words>
The fragility of time had not been mended, but its cracks now sang with shyly loud music, and the hesitant bard walked on, motivated to keep listening, to keep singing, to keep the tapestry from ever being woven again. <words>42</words>
