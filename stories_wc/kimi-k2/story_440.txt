The detached swordsman arrived at the futuristic city recycling center after the last swipe of paint completed a mural, his coat flapping like a torn banner. <words>25</words>
He carried no blade tonight, only a piece of sea pottery cupped in his palm, its glaze pitted by tides older than the neon skyline. <words>42</words>
Inside the humming plant, conveyor belts carried yesterday’s art toward shredders, and he watched with lovingly detached amusement as a street artist’s bin tipped its colored scraps into the maw. <words>63</words>
Among the shards he recognized fragments of the very mural just finished—an eye, a comet tail, the corner of a grin—proof that the secret weavers had already begun to meddle with destiny. <words>85</words>
He had once sworn an impossible vow: to guard beauty without touching it, to consecrate transience itself; tonight he would test that paradox. <words>106</words>
Kneeling beside the sorting rail, he began to reassemble collage scraps from the street artist’s bin, fingers nimble as calligraphy, arranging torn vinyl and shredded wheat-paste into a miniature replica of the vanished mural. <words>132</words>
Each scrap clicked against the sea pottery like shells in a tide, and the piece warmed, drinking color from the fragments until it glowed soft teal. <words>154</words>
A low chime rippled through the recycling center; the secret weavers were near, threading probability through discarded dreams. <words>175</words>
The swordsman lifted the collage-coated shard and whispered the vow again, playful yet serious, letting the words scatter like origami cranes into the air vents. <words>198</words>
The weavers answered by braiding light between the scraps, sealing them to the pottery until the object resembled a compass rose made of torn posters and ancient porcelain. <words>223</words>
He set the compass on the conveyor’s edge; it spun once, twice, then pointed toward the exit where the street artist herself stood, paint still wet on her knuckles. <words>249</words>
She looked at the swordsman with the same lovingly detached curiosity he felt, as though they were mirrors angled just enough to never quite touch. <words>275</words>
Without speaking, he offered her the sea pottery; she accepted, understanding that the impossible vow now rested between them like a shared secret. <words>300</words>
Behind them, the secret weavers tightened their invisible loom, and every scrap left in the bins lifted for a moment, saluting the consecration before settling back into ordinary waste. <words>329</words>
The mural, now reborn in miniature, would travel in the artist’s pocket, a pocket-sized promise that beauty could be guarded by letting it go. <words>356</words>
The swordsman turned away, coat flapping again, his duty discharged yet his detachment now threaded with a filament of color he could never quite wash out. <words>385</words>
Somewhere between the hum of compactors and the hush of neon, the impossible vow kept its impossible word, playful, serious, and forever unfinished. <words>410</words>
