In the hush before the first question is asked, the calm assassin drifted through the moonlit corridors of the ancient Chinese palace, his silk slippers making no more noise than a moth's heartbeat. <words>31</words>
He carried a botanical press beneath his arm like a secret joke, its brass clasps glinting with the same mischievous light that danced in his eyes whenever he contemplated the whispers of longing that had brought him here. <words>42</words>
These whispers were not sounds but scents—jasmine, gunpowder, and regret—rising from the courtyards below, where concubines practiced calligraphy with poisoned brushes and eunuchs gambled for memories they could never spend. <words>38</words>
The assassin had been hired to kill the Emperor's favorite astrologer, but his true mission was to amalgamate the old man's dying prophecy into something raw and possible, something that could flutter free of fate's iron cage. <words>38</words>
He found the astrologer in the Hall of Unasked Questions, hunched over a star chart that looked suspiciously like a butterfly's wing, its patterns spiraling outward in fractal loops that made the assassin's calm heart skip with humorous unease. <words>38</words>
"You're early," the astrologer said without looking up, his voice carrying the weight of centuries yet somehow light as rice paper. <words>21</words>
"I always arrive before the first question," the assassin replied, setting the botanical press on the lacquered table with deliberate care, "because questions have a way of pinning butterflies to boards." <words>32</words>
The old man laughed, a sound like wind chimes made of bone, and gestured to the star chart that was figuratively literal—each constellation a pressed flower, each nebula a drop of dried blood. <words>32</words>
"Take the prophecy," he whispered, "but spin it gently, like silk from a dying silkworm; make it something that can still dream of flying." <words>29</words>
The assassin opened the botanical press to reveal not flowers but folded paper wings, each inscribed with fragments of the prophecy he'd been collecting for years—the whispers of longing from every person he'd ever been sent to silence. <words>39</words>
By the pattern of a butterfly's wings, he began to amalgamate these fragments, weaving them together until the prophecy transformed from a death sentence into a love letter addressed to tomorrow. <words>35</words>
As dawn crept through the paper windows like a guilty secret, the assassin left the palace carrying only the empty press and a smile that was both calm and conspiratorial, having spun doom into possibility with nothing but patience and the memory of wings. <words>42</words>
Behind him, the astrologer's body lay peaceful as a sleeping child, while somewhere in the gardens, a butterfly emerged from its chrysalis bearing markings that looked suspiciously like a question mark. <words>35</words>
