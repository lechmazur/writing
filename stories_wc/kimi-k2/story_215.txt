The rattled exorcist, Sister Marisol, twirled through the mirrored studio at the psychic research facility, her rosary clacking against the metronome's beat amid dance lessons meant to synchronize mediums with their own heartbeats. <words>34</words>
She was inwardly social, craving confession yet offering only guarded disclosures, so she hid behind the coy aggression of a tango instructor correcting postures with razor smiles. <words>27</words>
Between counts of eight, she palmed a vintage postcard slipped under the barre: a 1909 sepia of the same ballroom, its caption reading "Where science learns to bow to wonder." <words>27</words>
The card's flip side bore a cipher of musical notes; she recognized the melody as the warm-up waltz, and her pulse quickened with the motive to entwine science with wonder once and for all. <words>30</words>
She told the class to partner off for a cha-cha, then whispered to the lead technician, "I need the lab cleared at midnight—tell them the spirits prefer a foxtrot." <words>26</words>
Alone, she laid the postcard atop the piano and began the first puzzle: striking the notes in reverse order, which caused the mirror wall to slide aside, revealing a brass astrolabe wired to EEG leads. <words>32</words>
The second puzzle required her to dance the exact steps painted on the postcard's border; her feet traced sigils that unlocked a drawer of glass syringes filled with phosphorescent ichor. <words>30</words>
With each solved enigma, her guarded disclosures loosened; she spoke aloud to the empty room, confessing how every exorcism had left her more scientist than priest, more skeptic than believer. <words>30</words>
The final lock was a heartbeat sensor calibrated to 120 bpm; she quick-stepped until sweat baptized the floor, and the hidden room yawned open like a throat lined with star charts. <words>29</words>
Inside, a single reel-to-reel spun, its tape labeled "Synthesis: Faith & Frequency." <words>13</words>
She threaded the tape, pressed play, and heard her own voice from a forgotten session: "If demons are frequencies, angels must be chords." <words>23</words>
The ichor glowed brighter, forming spectral dancers that waltzed through her chest, and she understood the facility had never been studying spirits—it had been teaching them to dance. <words>30</words>
She laughed, a sound both sharp and soft, then addressed the room with coy aggression: "Very well, partners; let's synthesize a miracle the peer-review board can't exorcise." <words>27</words>
On the back of the postcard she scrawled a new cipher, this one a foxtrot diagram, and slipped it beneath the door of the lead technician, her guarded disclosure now a dare. <words>29</words>
At dawn, the class returned to find her leading the phosphorescent dancers in a ronde, her rosary now a metronome pendulum, the rattled exorcist finally keeping perfect time between wonder and proof. <words>34</words>
