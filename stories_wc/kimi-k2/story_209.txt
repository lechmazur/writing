The seasoned woodsman, beard artfully messy like wind-torn moss, stepped into the radio wave garden where steel antennas grew like iron saplings among the rusted rails he once mapped. <words>31</words>
He carried an antique hairbrush that had belonged to the daughter who now lay dying, its silver back reflecting the final beep of a hospital monitor that had just gone quiet three counties away. <words>37</words>
Each bristle held a memory of her laughter, and he clutched it like a compass as despairing cheer warred inside him—grief trying to smile through cracked teeth. <words>29</words>
The garden hummed with phantom broadcasts, voices of engineers long dead still calling mile markers across frequencies no train would ever answer. <words>22</words>
He had come here to short-circuit his sorrow, to make the pain spark and die like an overloaded signal, but the antennas only amplified the ache. <words>26</words>
Following a ghost timetable, he climbed the ladder of the abandoned water tower that rose above the garden like a rusted prayer. <words>24</words>
Inside, his boots rang against hollow steel, and he began measuring the echo by counting heartbeats between shout and return, mapping absence the way he once mapped abandoned railways. <words>30</words>
"Track one," he called, voice cracking, "from grief to grace," and the echo came back distorted, stretched thin as wire. <words>23</words>
"Track two," he tried, "from lies to truth," and this time the echo returned clear, freed by honesty, the tower itself absolving him. <words>27</words>
He had told his daughter he would always find the way home, but the railways had vanished beneath shopping malls and silence, and he had gotten lost in whiskey instead of wilderness. <words>34</words>
Now, with each measured echo, he drew new lines across an interior map where stations had names like Forgiveness and Regret, where the trains ran on time only when he spoke true. <words>32</words>
The antique hairbrush caught a stray beam of moonlight filtering through the tower's bullet holes, and he saw his reflection fractured into a hundred silver shards—each piece a version of himself he had abandoned. <words>35</words>
He pressed the brush to his chest and whispered, "I was afraid," and the echo came back gentle, a father's voice he had forgotten he possessed. <words>27</words>
Outside, the radio wave garden crackled with sudden clarity as every antenna aligned, broadcasting his confession across frequencies only the dead could hear, and he knew his daughter was listening. <words>32</words>
The final beep had not been an ending but a signal to begin, and as he descended the tower, the artfully messy woodsman became the cartographer of his own redemption, mapping railways that existed only in the echo of honesty. <words>39</words>
