In the hush of a hidden sunrise above the neon lattice of the futuristic hub, reluctant caretaker Lira Voss stepped between rows of blackened apple trees whose fruit bled silver sap. <words>34</words>
She carried a fossilized dragon tooth in her pocket, its serrated edge pressing against her thigh like a memory trying to cut its way out. <words>25</words>
The orchard had been cursed since the orbital mirrors first tilted, and every dawn she walked its perimeter, analytically playful, counting the ways the curse might speak. <words>27</words>
Today the trees whispered coordinates—rotting farmhouses three kilometers west, where the city’s forgotten foundations sank into the soil. <words>22</words>
Lira’s motivation was simple and impossible: to become the voice of the unknown, to translate the orchard’s grief into something the hub’s citizens would finally hear. <words>27</words>
She gripped the dragon tooth until its ridges imprinted her palm, feeling the pulse of something ancient and winged. <words>20</words>
The first farmhouse stood like a cracked skull, its solar shingles hanging like loose teeth. <words>16</words>
Inside, she found a child’s diary fused to the wall by fungal resin; the pages spoke of dragons that once nested where skyscrapers now scraped the stratosphere. <words>27</words>
Lira laughed—a sound of gleeful sorrow—because the handwriting matched her own from twenty years ago, before the city erased her childhood. <words>23</words>
She moved to the second farmhouse, unlocking secrets in rotting farmhouses by tracing the tooth along rusted circuit boards until they flickered alive. <words>24</words>
Holograms bloomed: her grandmother’s final message, explaining the orchard was planted to anchor the dragons’ ghosts, and the curse was merely their refusal to be silent. <words>29</words>
The third farmhouse held only a mirror; in it, Lira saw herself sprouting obsidian wings, the dragon tooth glowing between her teeth. <words>22</words>
Understanding arrived like sunrise through stained glass: she was not the caretaker but the culmination, the last seed of a pact made when the city was still a village. <words>29</words>
She stepped outside as the hidden sunrise crested the hub’s horizon, painting the orchard in bruised gold. <words>19</words>
Lira raised the dragon tooth to her lips and spoke the first word of the curse aloud; the trees straightened, the sap turned clear, and the city’s alarms began to sing in dragon tongue. <words>33</words>
Citizens paused mid-stride, hearing in their bones the story of wings and exile, of caretakers who became voices. <words>21</words>
Lira wept as she spoke, her tears tasting of silver and smoke, gleeful sorrow flooding the streets like dawn. <words>20</words>
By the time the sun fully rose, the orchard had vanished, replaced by a garden of translucent eggs humming with future dragons. <words>22</words>
Lira stood among them, mouth open, finally the voice the unknown had waited for. <words>17</words>
