At dawn, when the day’s earliest train departs, the bleak clown limps onto the floating rock yoga studio, its granite edges already humming with pre-sunrise om. <words>29</words>
He carries a clock hand that won’t stop spinning, its brass blur slicing the thin air like a propeller of regret. <words>40</words>
Students in lotus hover inches above their mats, eyes closed, drifting promises of enlightenment tethered to their wrists like translucent kites. <words>54</words>
The clown’s greasepaint is cracked into a map of every town he failed to make laugh; still, his motivation is to outshine the northern lights with a grin fierce enough to shame the sky. <words>73</words>
He steps onto the instructor’s platform, technically absurd in oversized shoes that squeak against the void, and begins dismantling illusions in private poetry whispered so softly only the quartz crystals embedded in the rock can hear. <words>97</words>
“Time is a contortionist,” he murmurs, and the spinning clock hand obeys, bending into a Möbius strip that loops around his heart like a noose of seconds. <words>114</words>
Each verse he recites is jagged generosity: shards of truth that cut the students even as they offer light, because laughter born from pain glows brighter than any aurora. <words>136</words>
A woman whose promise reads “I will forgive” feels the word forgive evaporate, replaced by the salt of an old tear she never shed; she exhales, and the tear becomes a star that sticks to the clown’s cheek. <words>162</words>
The clown masters the room not by command but by surrender, letting the spinning clock hand carve open his chest until the hollow inside is visible, a dark theater with one dim bulb. <words>187</words>
In that theater, memories perform: a child who believed balloons were planets, a lover who left because his jokes arrived too late, an audience that clapped only when he fell. <words>213</words>
He offers these memories to the students like broken toys, and they accept, weaving them into their drifting promises until the kites turn heavy and begin to land. <words>239</words>
The northern lights flicker above the floating rock, green and violet ribbons trying to compete, but the clown’s grin widens, splitting the paint, revealing raw skin that glows phosphorescent with every confession. <words>267</words>
The clock hand slows, not from defeat but from recognition; it has measured every heartbeat and found them all equally absurd, equally precious. <words>290</words>
One by one, the students touch down, feet kissing stone, promises no longer drifting but rooted, tangled with the clown’s verses like ivy on ruins. <words>315</words>
He bows, oversized shoes scraping quartz, and the studio begins to descend toward the waking world below, a slow surrender to gravity that feels like forgiveness. <words>343</words>
As the earliest train whistles across the tundra, the clown tucks the now-still clock hand into his breast pocket, next to the star-tear, and steps off the rock onto the snowy platform. <words>375</words>
Behind him, the northern lights dim, conceding the sky to a single, lingering grin that keeps shining even after the clown has vanished into the steam of the departing cars. <words>404</words>
