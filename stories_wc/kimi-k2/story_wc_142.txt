The raft city of Carnevale Eterno drifted three kilometers off the drowned coast of what had once been Naples, its brass calliope never silent, its lanterns never dimmed. [34]  
On the eve before privatization, when corporate barges already circled like gulls, Lila Moreau stepped onto the swaying dock with the wary grace of a culture shock absorber trained in three continents. [55]  
She carried nothing but a canvas satchel and a single foundation stone chip—no larger than a euro—chipped from the Basilica di San Gennaro before the sea swallowed the old city. [78]  
The chip was both relic and compass; when warmed by her palm it tugged her toward the heart of the perpetual carnival, a living map of dual allegiance: to the drowned past and to the floating present that refused to drown with it. [104]  
Lila’s gift was orderly intuitive; she could walk a riot of color and noise and still trace the hidden grid beneath, the way sailors once read stars. [125]  
Tonight the grid was failing. [129]  
Corporate surveyors had painted pale blue survey glyphs over the riotous murals, turning jokes into barcodes, love poems into QR links. [150]  
The carnival’s artists answered by reorganizing the city’s skin overnight, repainting corridors so that a trompe-l’oeil alley became a real escape, a cherub’s trumpet became a working valve. [175]  
They worked through messages encoded in graffiti art: a spray-painted mermaid whose scales spelled out meeting times in hexadecimal, a laughing harlequin whose tears dripped coordinates in Morse. [203]  
Lila’s job was to read the city’s new grammar before the buyers did. [215]  
She pressed the warm stone chip to the first mural, a rearing lion whose mane was woven with binary. [232]  
The chip vibrated three short pulses—north-northwest—toward the House of Mirrors. [247]  
Inside, mirrors faced mirrors, multiplying jugglers, fire-eaters, and Lila herself into an endless regiment. [265]  
On the central glass someone had written in reverse lipstick: “When the raft is sold, the mirrors become billboards. [284]  
Meet the Whale at dawn.” [290]  
The Whale was the oldest float, a lumbering wooden leviathan whose ribs were struts from the basilica Lila’s chip remembered. [310]  
She found its keeper, old Tomasso, greasing the jaw hinges with carnival tallow. [325]  
He recognized the chip at once and pressed it into a notch hidden behind the left baleen; the Whale exhaled a chord of organ pipes that had once sung inside San Gennaro. [350]  
“Dual allegiance,” Tomasso said, “is a knife you hold by both edges. [365]  
We serve the living city and the dead one, but tomorrow the corporations will make us choose.” [382]  
Lila felt the hopeful desperation that had driven every refugee artist aboard: the need to keep the party loud enough that no ledger could hear the city’s heartbeat. [407]  
Tomasso handed her a spray can whose nozzle had been carved into a fleur-de-lis. [422]  
“Reorganize the outer hull,” he said. [430]  
“Paint the surveyors’ marks into a maze that leads them back to their own boats. [443]  
Use the stone to test each line; if it warms, the wall still remembers Naples.” [458]  
All night Lila climbed rope ladders and slid down canvas chutes, drawing spirals that swallowed arrows, arrows that became fish, fish that dissolved into musical notation. [485]  
Each time the chip glowed, she felt the orderly intuitive grid reassert itself beneath the chaos, a heartbeat syncing old stone to new timber. [510]  
Dawn bled pink across the water; corporate horns sounded, polite as funeral bells. [525]  
Buyers in linen suits stepped onto the raft, escorted by guards whose sunglasses reflected the riot of color like dead screens. [548]  
They followed the freshly painted maze, confident their blue glyphs would lead them to the central square where contracts waited. [569]  
Instead the maze tightened, coiled, delivered them back to the gangplank they had crossed, now labeled in ten-foot letters: “PROPERTY OF MEMORY.” [592]  
The buyers hesitated; the carnival drums grew louder, hopeful desperation turned into defiant brass. [610]  
Lila stood atop the Whale, stone chip raised like a lantern. [622]  
She shouted—not a battle cry but a carnival barker’s promise: “Step right up, gentlemen, bid on the last dream before it learns to swim!” [648]  
Confused, the lead negot
