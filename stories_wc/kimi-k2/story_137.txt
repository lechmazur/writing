At the hush after a cashier closes out the register, the subtle illusionist climbed the last invisible stair to the temple in the clouds, humming a doleful cheer that made the mist shimmer like unpaid bills. <words>34</words>
He carried nothing but an unmarked binder clip pinched between forefinger and thumb, its steel jaws glinting with the casually intense promise of holding more than paper. <words>27</words>
Inside the open nave of cumulus, votive lanterns flickered with memories of streetlights seen through rain, and the understory grew beneath them—roots of vapor tangling into sentences no tongue had yet spoken. <words>31</words>
The illusionist knelt, unfolded the clip, and let it bite a single square of antique lace he had stolen from a grandmother’s collar, the pattern itself a cipher of knots and vacancies. <words>29</words>
Following instructions woven into the antique lace pattern, he threaded moonlight through each eyelet, rekindle by rekindle, until the cloth became a loom of faint heartbeats. <words>27</words>
Each pulse spelled a syllable he had never been brave enough to say: forgive, remain, remember. <words>15</words>
A novice cloud-monk drifted near, sandals leaving no print on the vapor floor, and asked in a voice like closing metal, “Why disturb the quiet with longing?” <words>26</words>
The illusionist smiled the way street buskers do when the last coin drops after the crowd has gone, and replied, “I am here to learn the language of the heart before my own forgets how to speak.” <words>34</words>
He pressed the lace against the growing understory; tendrils of mist rose and curled around the pattern, drinking the syllables until the cloud floor rustled with half-formed words. <words>30</words>
The monk watched, eyes softening like wax near flame, then offered a single tear that had never fallen; the tear slid onto the lace and translated the final knot into a question mark. <words>30</words>
Wind, polite as a librarian at closing time, turned the lace page; the understory grew denser, weaving itself into a small cloud-child who looked up at the illusionist with his own forgotten face. <words>31</words>
Recognition cracked his practiced calm; the binder clip slipped, clipping the child’s ephemeral sleeve, anchoring the memory long enough for the illusionist to whisper, “Stay.” <words>27</words>
But cloud-children are made to drift; the boy dissolved into soft syllables that settled on the illusionist’s tongue like snow on warm skin, teaching him the grammar of letting go. <words>30</words>
The monk bowed, vapor robes folding into dusk, and the temple dimmed to a single lantern swaying above the understory that now spelled, in faint pulses across the floor, the sentence the illusionist would carry home. <words>35</words>
He descended the invisible stairs at the same hush, the unmarked binder clip now holding only a strip of clear sky, and though his step was light, the doleful cheer in his throat had learned a new, tender word. <words>38</words>
