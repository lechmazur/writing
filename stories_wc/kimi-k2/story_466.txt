The cunning connoisseur of forgotten flavors, Lysander Vale, paused between pyramids of oranges and whispering lettuce, vintage seed packets rustling like old love letters in his coat pocket amid grocery shopping. <words>31</words>
Each packet bore cryptic glyphs no botanist alive could read, yet Lysander felt their pollen-dust calling him to corner an elusive destiny that smelled faintly of saffron and regret. <words>42</words>
A sudden urge to explore a path not taken seized him when the store's fluorescent lights flickered into the shape of an arrow pointing toward the loading dock, gentle chaos humming in the fluorescent hum. <words>55</words>
He followed, stepping over spilled lentils and crushed cilantro, until the asphalt gave way to a narrow trail climbing the ridge where the old smoke signal tower stood like a charred candle against the bruised sky. <words>70</words>
Inside the tower, soot ghosts spiraled around iron rungs; Lysander climbed, morally ambiguous heart ticking between preservation and profit, vintage seed packets clinking like tiny bells. <words>83</words>
At the summit, a rusted xerograph machine squatted beneath a cracked skylight, its glass platen fogged with decades of ash, waiting for the forgotten to be decoded. <words>95</words>
Lysander fed the first packet—pepper called “Midnight Ember”—into the feeder; the machine coughed, then spat out a sepia image of the tower itself, but younger, wrapped in flowering vines heavy with obsidian fruit. <words>110</words>
The second packet—“Sorrow’s Sage”—produced a map of paths never built, dotted with stalls that sold memories by the gram, and at the center, his own face, older, smiling without guile. <words>124</words>
Gentle chaos fluttered; the tower swayed as if breathing, and smoke began to rise from the machine, forming letters: PLANT ME WHERE YOU FEAR TO GARDEN. <words>137</words>
Lysander understood then that cornering destiny meant surrendering the corner; he tore open the last packet—“Dawn Thief”—and let the seeds rain onto the sooty floor. <words>150</words>
The xerograph shuddered, projecting a final image: the tower blooming into a living library of extinct flavors, its smoke signals spelling recipes that could heal or poison depending on the hunger of the reader. <words>165</words>
He laughed, the sound both rueful and relieved, morally ambiguous no longer but beautifully uncertain, and began to sweep the seeds into a circle, tracing the path not taken with fingertip and ash. <words>178</words>
Outside, grocery bags rolled across the parking lot like tumbleweeds of mundane time, while inside the tower, vines already crept upward, carrying the taste of futures he would never sell. <words>192</words>
Lysander stayed until dusk, decoding the soft pops of germinating seeds, each crack a syllable in the forgotten language of second chances. <words>205</words>
When he finally descended, the tower’s door had vanished behind a curtain of green; he carried nothing but the scent of Midnight Ember on his palms and the knowledge that destiny, once cornered, becomes a garden. <words>220</words>
He walked back through the produce aisle, oranges glowing like small suns, lettuce murmuring secrets, and slipped the empty seed envelopes between crates of tomatoes for the next cunning connoisseur to find amid grocery shopping. <words>235</words>
