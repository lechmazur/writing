In the underwater city planning office, where blueprints floated like kelp and the hush of time’s final ripple pressed against every glass wall, the meek blacksmith waited with a softcover dictionary clenched to his chest. <words>37</words>
The book was openly hidden beneath a cloak of woven algae fibers, its spine cracked from years of verifying half-baked stories from random hitchhikers who drifted down from the surface world. <words>31</words>
Each tale they told—of love lost to war, of children swallowed by storms—he weighed against the dictionary’s definitions, searching for the precise moment when heartbreak could ignite into something useful. <words>30</words>
The unfinished bargain that haunted him had been struck decades ago, when he traded his forge for the chance to design cities that would never drown, never rust, never echo with the clang of regret. <words>30</words>
But the city had grown anyway, its towers now leaning like tired sentinels, and the bargain remained incomplete because he had never found the right sorrow to fuel the final blueprint. <words>29</words>
Tonight, a hitchhiker arrived with a story so raw it shimmered: a woman who set fire to her own wedding dress after learning her bride had died at sea. <words>27</words>
The blacksmith listened, fingers tracing the word “combustion” in the dictionary, feeling the definition pulse like a second heartbeat. <words>21</words>
He asked the hitchhiker to repeat the tale three times, each version slightly altered, until the inconsistencies burned away and only the pure grief remained. <words>25</words>
With luminous regret, he realized this was the sorrow he needed—not the dress, but the moment the woman understood love could outlast flesh and still fail. <words>27</words>
He pressed the dictionary to the glass wall, where the city’s last unlit corridor waited, and whispered the definition of “ignite” into the water. <words>25</words>
The corridor flared to life, coral blooming along its edges in patterns shaped like the woman’s final scream. <words>19</words>
The bargain was sealed at last: the city would stand forever, but every brick would carry the weight of that scream, every window would reflect the bride’s drowned eyes. <words>29</words>
The blacksmith sank to his knees, feeling the hush of time’s final ripple settle over him like a shroud. <words>21</words>
He had harnessed heartbreak as fuel, but the cost was his own memory of the forge, of hammer and anvil, of anything that had once been solid. <words>27</words>
The dictionary slipped from his grasp and drifted upward, its pages scattering definitions like ashes, each word a small, luminous regret that would never again be openly hidden. <words>30</words>
