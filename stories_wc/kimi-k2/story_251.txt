The ambivalent prophet stood at the edge of the lunar mining colony's observation deck, clutching his cracked collection of marbles like prayer beads that had lost their religion. <words>29</words>
Between heartbeats, he felt the colony's artificial gravity falter—a glitch that made his stomach lurch with bashful arrogance at how he'd predicted this exact moment three cycles ago, though nobody had listened. <words>42</words>
His fingers traced the spider-web fractures in the glass spheres, each crack a constellation mapping the paths of miners who'd died chasing the moon's hollow promises. <words>34</words>
The final oath he'd sworn to the colony's AI council weighed on him like the vacuum outside—absolute silence pressing against his eardrums, making him happily sad that he'd finally found something worth breaking. <words>40</words>
In the rummage sale box he'd discovered yesterday, beneath yellowed instruction manuals and broken holo-disks, lay jigsaw puzzle edges that hummed with quantum uncertainty. <words>34</words>
These weren't ordinary puzzle pieces—they were fragments of the cosmic scoreboard itself, the one that tracked every soul's worth in cold, algorithmic points. <words>31</words>
He began to defragment the pieces, fitting them together with the precision of a man who'd spent years calculating asteroid trajectories but could never solve the equation of his own heart. <words>37</words>
Each connection between puzzle edges rewrote reality in micro-adjustments: a miner's daughter suddenly remembered her father's lullabies, a foreman's ledger showed profits that didn't exist, the colony's oxygen recyclers sang operatic arias. <words>39</words>
His cracked marbles pulsed in rhythm with the puzzle's completion, their fractures glowing like bioluminescent scars. <words>22</words>
The prophet's motivation crystallized—not to destroy the scoreboard, but to scramble it beyond recognition, to make the universe forget its cruel accounting. <words>30</words>
As the final piece clicked into place, he whispered his own name backwards three times, the ancient trick that unmade identity while preserving essence. <words>27</words>
The colony shuddered, not from mechanical failure but from metaphysical recalibration. <words>14</words>
Miners throughout the complex paused mid-drill, feeling something shift in their chests—not their hearts, but the space where hearts had been measured and found wanting. <words>34</words>
His collection of marbles dissolved into stardust, each particle carrying a fragment of every story the colony had tried to erase. <words>27</words>
Standing there, happily sad and bashfully arrogant, the prophet watched the cosmic scoreboard flicker, its numbers dancing into meaningless beauty. <words>27</words>
Between one heartbeat and the next, the lunar mining colony became a place where worth couldn't be calculated, only experienced. <words>25</words>
The prophet smiled, knowing he'd finally kept his final oath—not by saving anyone, but by making salvation impossible to quantify. <words>27</words>
