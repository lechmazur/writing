<story>
Sir Aldric, the cold-natured knight, stepped from the unmarked door of the secret agent center into the hush of a deserted intersection late at night, his breath frosting like glass. <words>29</words>
He carried no sword, only a child’s lost mitten clenched in his gauntleted fist, its wool still warm with the ghost of small fingers. <words>22</words>
The mitten was evidence, but also a summons; inside its cuff, a scrap of parchment listed herbs—yarrow, feverfew, heartsease—folk remedies he had sworn to collect for the plague-ridden outer wards. <words>29</words>
Yet the law he served forbade unsanctioned healing, branding it rebellion; Aldric, lawfully rebellious, had chosen to obey the higher statute of mercy. <words>20</words>
Across the empty street, a flickering neon pharmacy sign buzzed like a trapped moth, casting violet halos on the incomplete family altars propped against the lampposts—photographs, candles, single gloves waiting for partners that never returned. <words>34</words>
Each altar was a petition; Aldric moved among them, slipping the mitten beside a cracked frame of a smiling girl, completing the pair, completing the plea. <words>23</words>
The act was small, but the secret agent center had taught him that smallness could tilt empires. <words>16</words>
He knelt, gloved fingers tracing the rough wood, and felt the first tremor of an artistic awakening: the arrangement of objects as prayer, the placement of color as defiance. <words>25</words>
Cold by constitution, he had always painted battlefields in monochrome; now he saw palettes in candlewax, symphonies in silence. <words>19</words>
A surveillance drone hummed overhead, its lens a blind eye at this hour; still, Aldric spoke aloud, voice low, intimate, as if the night itself leaned in. <words>25</words>
“I will support you,” he promised the absent child, the absent mother, the absent city, “via incomplete family altars, until every missing piece is found or forged.” <words>26</words>
He rose, cloak whispering like turning pages, and walked on, pockets already filling with sprigs stolen from the agency’s greenhouse. <words>20</words>
At the next corner he built another altar: a bent spoon, a metro ticket, the second mitten now paired with the first, forming a heart-shaped shadow under the lamplight. <words>25</words>
Each addition was a stanza in a poem only the desperate would read. <words>14</words>
By dawn, the intersection bloomed with quiet color, and Aldric, still cold, felt a warmth spreading from his chest to his fingertips, as though the mittens had taught his heart to knit. <words>30</words>
He slipped away before the city woke, leaving behind not just remedies, but a gallery of rebellion no law could dismantle. <words>22</words>
