The arboretum perched on the seaside cliff had no keeper now that the last lighthouse keeper had gone. [21]
Mira walked the gravel path between wind-sculpted pines, her fingers brushing the crumpled photograph she carried like a second pulse. [34]
In the image, her sister wore a white dress and laughed at something the camera would never record; the same laugh had been cut short by a drone strike that mistook the wedding procession for a convoy. [55]
Since then Mira had become a drone strike wedding survivor, a phrase she repeated to herself until it sounded like a species name. [73]
She had also become quietly talented at noticing the exact moment when joy began to tilt toward grief, a skill she practiced on strangers in cafés and on the wind-battered branches above her now. [97]
The arboretum was said to hold a pearl of stillness at its heart, a place where even the sea paused to listen. [115]
Mira did not believe in magic, but she believed in the need for somewhere the noise could not reach. [131]
She followed the scent of salt and rosemary until the path opened onto a small stone circle where a single olive tree grew out of a crack in the cliff. [154]
The wind here was softer, as though it had exhausted itself against the trunk and now only whispered. [172]
Mira sat on the warm stone and unfolded the photograph, smoothing its creases with the side of her thumb. [188]
The paper had grown thin at the folds, almost translucent, like skin over a healing wound. [203]
She closed her eyes and let the somatic markers rise: the metallic taste that arrived whenever she heard rotors, the sudden drop in temperature along her forearms, the way her lungs would freeze mid-breath. [232]
These were not memories but bodily facts, the alphabet her nerves had learned to spell danger. [250]
She breathed through them, counting four seconds in, four seconds out, until the markers softened into background noise. [268]
When she opened her eyes, the olive tree had not moved, yet it seemed to lean toward her with patient curiosity. [284]
She pressed the photograph against the bark and felt the slow heartbeat of sap beneath. [296]
In that contact she sensed the pearl of stillness—not a jewel but a moment balanced so perfectly that past and future lost their grip. [316]
The grief did not vanish; it simply sat beside her like a guest who had been waiting to be acknowledged. [333]
Mira spoke aloud for the first time in days, telling the tree what her sister had planned to name her first child, how the cake had been flavored with orange blossom, how the sky had been the same color as the sea below them now. [370]
With each detail the photograph grew heavier, as if it were drinking the story and returning weight for weight in calm. [389]
She realized then that to anchor optimism in realism meant not to deny the strike but to let it settle inside her like silt in clear water, visible yet no longer churning. [418]
The tree offered no advice, only the steadiness of something that had survived storms by bending rather than breaking. [437]
Mira took a pen from her pocket and on the back of the photograph wrote the date, the place, and the words: “Still possible.” [457]
She folded the paper once more, this time along different lines, and tucked it into a hollow where bark had peeled away. [476]
The act felt less like leaving something behind than like planting a seed that would grow into a different shape of memory. [495]
A gull cried overhead, and she followed its flight out to where the lighthouse stood dark against the glittering water. [514]
No keeper lit it now; ships navigated by satellites and algorithms, yet the tower remained, a monument to the way we once signaled across darkness. [540]
Mira stood, knees creaking like the branches above, and began the walk back through the arboretum. [558]
The wind had shifted, carrying with it the smell of rain and distant diesel, reminders that the world outside continued its patient errors. [578]
She carried no certainty, only the quiet talent of noticing when a moment held enough space for both sorrow and the next breath. [600]
At the gate she paused, one hand on the weathered wood, and felt the somatic markers rearrange themselves into a new pattern: not warning but witness. [625]
She would return, she decided, when the olive tree flowered, to see what had grown from the photograph and the pearl of stillness it now guarded. [650]
The path down to the village was steep, but her steps were steady, anchored not by forgetting but by the precise weight of what she chose to carry forward. [678]
Behind her, the arboretum kept its cliffside
