The unlucky meteorologist, Dr. Mara Voss, clutched her mariner’s sextant like a talisman against the sky’s systematic chaos, the brass still warm from the last time it had failed her. <words>25</words>
She had come to the underground city of the lizard people not for weather, but to study plant behaviors in the bioluminescent grottoes where roots drank starlight instead of rain. <words>42</words>
Between colliding interests—her grant money drying up and the lizard council demanding forecasts for their warrens—she took a shortcut through the obsidian market, hoping to avoid the sparring pits where truth was currency. <words>65</words>
An unexpected encounter waited: a scaled botanist named Kess, whose frill flickered bitter honey gold when he spoke. <words>80</words>
“You measure storms,” Kess hissed, “but never the storm inside a seed.” <words>93</words>
Mara lifted the sextant, its mirrors catching the phosphor glow. <words>104</words>
“I chart what can be spoken,” she said, voice rasping like dry leaves, “not the lies roots whisper to soil.” <words>120</words>
Kess’s tail lashed, scattering spores that drifted like violet snow. <words>132</words>
“Then spar with me,” he challenged, “and trade spoken truths for every bruise.” <words>145</words>
They circled on the slick basalt, meteorologist and botanist, each step releasing scents of crushed moss and ozone. <words>161</words>
Mara jabbed with the sextant’s arc, measuring angles of his shoulders; Kess countered with tendrils of ivy that wrapped her wrists like green manacles. <words>180</words>
With each parry she confessed: “I chase cosmic events because the sky never blames me for being wrong.” <words>198</words>
Kess twisted, pinning her against a glowing fungus. <words>208</words>
“Plants remember every drought you predict,” he said, “and they still reach for you.” <words>223</words>
The systematic chaos of her failures crystallized into a single, bitter honey drop on her tongue. <words>237</words>
She whispered, “I want to learn the grammar of leaves.” <words>247</words>
Kess released her, frill softening. <words>254</words>
“Then stay,” he offered, “between our colliding interests, where roots write forecasts in rings.” <words>270</words>
Mara lowered the sextant, seeing in its tarnished face the reflection of a woman no longer unlucky, only unfinished. <words>287</words>
She spoke the last truth aloud: “I came underground to hide from the sky, but the sky followed me in seeds.” <words>305</words>
Kess guided her past the sparring pits to a cavern where vines braided constellations across the ceiling. <words>323</words>
Together they measured the slow pulse of chlorophyll like a heartbeat, trading spoken truths for every new leaf. <words>340</words>
The mariner’s sextant became a trellis; her bitterness, nectar. <words>350</words>
And in the underground city of the lizard people, the unlucky meteorologist finally found weather that listened. <words>370</words>
