In the hush as the last parade float disappears, the grieving miner slips through the alley door of the secret society meeting hall, clutching a tiny bell, silent since the cave-in that took his crew. <words>37</words>
He is passionately indifferent to the masked faces turning toward him; only careful observations matter now, the way lamplight once mattered underground. <words>27</words>
Tonight’s minutes are after-images from persistent nightmares: sparks that refuse to die, helmets bobbing like lanterns, the hiss of failing air. <words>22</words>
He crosses the marble floor, noting how the gas sconces have been replaced by humming tubes—another technological shift to chronicle before memory rusts. <words>25</words>
At the lectern he sets the bell beside a ledger thick with dust and grief, then begins to coax the room with a voice soft as coal smoke. <words>25</words>
“Observe,” he says, tapping the bell; no ring answers, yet every watcher leans closer, hearing the absence. <words>20</words>
He describes the parade outside: brass drones instead of marching bands, confetti printed with circuit diagrams, children waving holo-flags that dissolve into starlight. <words>26</words>
Between sentences he counts heartbeats, measuring sorrow the way engineers once measured seams, careful observations disguised as anecdotes. <words>22</words>
A woman in a fox mask asks why he stays passionately indifferent to applause; he replies that applause is just another cave-in waiting to happen. <words>25</words>
Laughter ripples, poignant levity rising like methane, bright and dangerous. <words>12</words>
He lifts the bell again, letting its silence speak of picks replaced by plasma cutters, canaries by sensors, camaraderie by contracts. <words>24</words>
The after-images flare: his foreman’s grin dissolving into static, the last canary’s flutter becoming a drone’s whir. <words>20</words>
He confesses he keeps the bell to chronicle technological shifts the way others keep photographs, each mute clapper a footnote in an unwritten manual. <words>27</words>
Tonight he offers the ledger, inviting every masked witness to ink their own vanishing trades—coaxing memory into communal stone before it erodes. <words>26</words>
Pages turn like slow shovels; someone sketches a steam drill, another glues a sliver of fiber-optic cable, each entry a careful observation against forgetting. <words>26</words>
The grieving miner smiles, feeling the room tilt toward tenderness, the way tunnels once tilted toward daylight. <words>21</words>
When the final entry is done, he bows, places the silent bell atop the fresh ink, and walks out into the emptied street where confetti lies like fallen stars. <words>29</words>
Behind him, the hall’s new lights flicker once, twice, then steady—technology keeping vigil over the chronicle he leaves behind. <words>22</words>
In the hush as the last parade float disappears, the grieving miner slips through the alley door of the secret society meeting hall, clutching a tiny bell, silent since the cave-in that took his crew. <words>37</words>
