<story>
In the spontaneous combustion lab, forgotten noble Lysander Vale adjusted the cracked goggles that once bore his family crest, the hollow recklessness of exile humming louder than the Bunsen chorus around him. <words>31</words>
Between text messages from creditors and former friends, he studied the artificial hummingbird drone he had built from scavenged lab parts, its wings etched with the same Latin motto that once adorned the Vale gates: Veritas in Minimis. <words>42</words>
The motto—candor in small moments—felt like mockery now, yet it was mysteriously obvious that every stub of every train ticket he had hoarded since his disgrace still carried microscopic fragments of truth he had refused to see. <words>57</words>
He spread the faded stubs across the blast table like a cartographer of ruin, each destination a breadcrumb back to the instant his inheritance combusted in scandal. <words>71</words>
Between text messages—one buzz: “Where are you?” another: “Pay or burn”—he began to reassemble the stubs, aligning torn edges until the perforations spelled a confession he had never spoken aloud. <words>87</words>
The artificial hummingbird drone hovered above the mosaic, its camera eye projecting the stubs’ thermal ghosts onto the lab wall, revealing heat signatures of lies told in first-class carriages. <words>103</words>
Lysander’s motivation sharpened: to cut through illusions, he must fortify the candor encoded in these scraps, letting the combustion lab’s controlled infernos burn away the varnish of noble pretense. <words>119</words>
He fed the stubs, layer by layer, into the ignition chamber, the drone darting between flames to capture the exact moment each inked date curled into revelation. <words>133</words>
Between text messages—now silent, the creditors perhaps imagining him already ash—he watched the projected wall bloom with memories: champagne smuggled in coat linings, promises whispered to shareholders, the small, precise betrayal that toppled an empire. <words>152</words>
The hummingbird drone returned, landing on his gloved finger, its micro-rotors cooling, and transmitted a single synthesized phrase in his own forgotten voice: “I lied about the fire.” <words>167</words>
The confession was mysteriously obvious now, echoing in the hollow chamber of his chest louder than any explosion. <words>179</words>
Lysander laughed, a brittle sound that rattled the glassware, and used the drone’s laser to etch the confession onto the last unburned stub—a return ticket he never used. <words>194</words>
He sealed the etched stub inside the drone’s thorax, programming it to deliver the truth to the one creditor who had once been his childhood friend, the only person who might still recognize the crest beneath the soot. <words>210</words>
Between text messages that would never come again, he opened the blast door, releasing the drone into the night sky above the city that had erased his name. <words>224</words>
The lab lights dimmed, the hollow recklessness replaced by a quiet, almost weightless certainty: the small moment of candor had been fortified, and whatever burned next would at least burn true. <words>240</words>
