In the arboreal workshop suspended among giant mushrooms, the insomniac painter Elara stirred pigments with a spoon she once used to devour midnight soup. <words>25</words>
Her eyes, ringed like storm clouds, flicked toward the tapered wizard’s hat with a bullet hole that hung from a hook of glowing mycelium. <words>20</words>
The hat had arrived three nights ago, couriered by a moth wearing a monocle, and ever since the painted smiles on her canvases had begun to twitch. <words>21</words>
Elara blamed the hush of an empty classroom at first light, where she sometimes crept to watch chalk dust settle like regret. <words>18</words>
Tonight, though, she stayed home, because the final obstacle—sleep itself—was winning, and she meant to outlast it. <words>17</words>
She carried a lantern of fireflies to the balcony, knelt, and began scrying in puddles after midnight, letting rainwater lap her wrists. <words>19</words>
The puddle showed her a peacefully chaotic swirl: mushroom caps dancing, paintbrushes sprouting wings, and her own face cracking like old varnish. <words>19</words>
Behind the painted smiles she saw the truth—each grin was a locked door, and behind them stood versions of herself she had abandoned to exhaustion. <words>22</words>
One child-self held the wizard’s hat, finger poked through the bullet hole as if it were a peephole into another life. <words>17</words>
Elara reached through the water, but the image rippled, scattering the child like ink in rain. <words>14</words>
Frolicsome regret bubbled up; she laughed, then sobbed, then laughed again, the sounds weaving into the night like drunken fireflies. <words>18</words>
She lifted the hat, felt its velvet weight, and pressed the hole to her eye, peering through at the workshop now kaleidoscoped by moonlight. <words>19</words>
Colors bled from the walls, pooling at her feet, and she realized the obstacle was not sleep but surrender to the stories she refused to finish. <words>21</words>
So she set a fresh canvas on the easel, dipped her brush into the puddle’s borrowed visions, and began to paint the child with the hat, bullet hole blooming like a midnight poppy. <words>25</words>
Each stroke devoured a sliver of fear; each color devoured a shard of silence. <words>13</words>
By dawn, the canvas was complete: the child smiled, but the smile was open, a doorway instead of a mask. <words>17</words>
Elara hung the wizard’s hat beside it, the bullet hole now a wink between worlds. <words>13</words>
She curled beneath the mushroom rafters, eyelids finally heavy, and let the peacefully chaotic workshop hum her to rest. <words>16</words>
In the hush of the empty classroom at first light, a chalk drawing of her face appeared, smiling without paint, the final obstacle gently outlasted. <words>21</words>
