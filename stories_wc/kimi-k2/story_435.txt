The professional dream interpreter, Lysandra Vale, found the crumpled invitation wedged between the copper pipes of the vapor collection facility, its ink smeared like tears. <words>25</words>
She recognized the seal—an ouroboros biting its own tail—and felt the quiet pulse begin beneath her ribs, a rhythm she had only ever sensed in other people's dreams. <words>42</words>
During baking, when the facility's ovens exhaled sweet steam that calcified into sugary stalactites, she unfolded the invitation and read: "Come as her, or not at all." <words>59</words>
The "her" was Marisol Crane, the missing dream-architect whose absence had rewritten the laws carved in stone above the facility's entrance: NO SELF IN SLEEP. <words>77</words>
Lysandra's peculiar faith told her that impersonating a missing person was less betrayal than rescue, so she studied Marisol's last recorded dream—a loop of falling feathers that turned to ash. <words>97</words>
She practiced Marisol's slight limp, her habit of humming thirds off-key, the way she measured time by the occasionally frequent drip of condensed vapor. <words>115</words>
On the night of the gathering, Lysandra arrived cloaked in Marisol's mannerisms, her heart beating the quiet pulse like a Morse code prayer. <words>132</words>
The facility's overseers wore masks of polished obsidian; they guided her past ovens where dough rose like sleeping giants, past pipes that sang with trapped lullabies. <words>152</words>
"You've returned to rewrite," the tallest overseer whispered, pressing a stylus into her hand that felt heavier than guilt. <words>169</words>
But when Lysandra approached the stone tablets, she saw the laws weren't carved—they were baked, soft enough to dent with a fingertip, hardening as they cooled. <words>189</words>
She wrote: DREAMS BELONG TO THEIR DREAMERS, each letter steaming, calcifying into permanence even as the quiet pulse quickened in her throat. <words>208</words>
The overseers removed their masks, revealing faces identical to Marisol's, each one slightly different—one older, one younger, one with eyes full of vapor. <words>228</words>
"We are all her," they chorused, "fragments she scattered when she learned the laws could bend." <words>245</words>
Lysandra understood then: Marisol hadn't disappeared; she had multiplied, becoming the occasionally frequent echo in every dream the facility collected. <words>265</words>
The invitation hadn't summoned Marisol back—it had summoned someone who could dream her whole again. <words>282</words>
Lysandra pressed her palms to the warm stone, feeling the quiet pulse spread from her chest into the tablets, rewriting not just the words but their meaning. <words>302</words>
The ovens sighed; the vapor condensed into feathers that didn't burn, drifting upward like reversed snow. <words>320</words>
As the new laws hardened, Lysandra felt herself becoming less interpreter, more interpreted—Marisol's dreams settling into her bones like rising dough. <words>340</words>
She smiled with peculiar faith, knowing that tomorrow the invitation would crumple itself again, waiting for the next interpreter who understood that missing persons are just dreams we've forgotten how to read. <words>365</words>
The facility continued its eternal baking, but now the vapor carried whispers of freedom, and the quiet pulse beat in every loaf, every pipe, every sleeping mind. <words>385</words>
Lysandra walked home through streets that smelled of bread and possibility, her shadow stretching long and many-limbed behind her, already beginning to fade into someone else's dream. <words>405</words>
