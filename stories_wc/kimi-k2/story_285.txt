<story>
The hesitant swordsman stood at the edge of the frigid tundra orchard, steam curling from geothermal vents like ghosts of warmer days. <words>21</words>
In his gloved hand he clutched a blank postcard, its surface as empty as the sky above the twisted ice-apple trees. <words>34</words>
He was naturally awkward, always fumbling with his scabbard when words failed him, which was often. <words>46</words>
The postcard had arrived three days ago, addressed to no one, postmarked from a village that no longer existed. <words>59</words>
Now, when the final piece of evidence was filed away in the capital's archives—proof that the traditional shell-exchange rituals had been outlawed—he had come here to fulfill his grandmother's dying wish. <words>83</words>
She had spoken of bridging worlds, of how the hermit crabs' ancient migrations between shells carried messages between the living and the lost. <words>98</words>
The geothermal vents hissed with ephemeral rancor, as if the earth itself resented being forced to remember. <words>112</words>
He watched the hermit crabs emerge from beneath the ice, their borrowed shells clicking like dice in a gambler's cup. <words>126</words>
Each crab carried a fragment of shell painted with symbols—the last remnants of the old language that had governed trade, marriage, and mourning. <words>144</words>
The swordsman knelt, his knees cracking in the cold, and placed the blank postcard among the moving shells. <words>158</words>
A large crab with a barnacle-crusted whelk shell approached, its eyestalks weaving patterns he almost understood. <words>173</words>
He had trained with the blade to restore traditional systems, but steel felt clumsy compared to this delicate choreography of shells. <words>189</words>
The crab climbed onto the postcard, its legs leaving tiny scratches that began to form words—his grandmother's handwriting. <words>205</words>
"Tradition is not preserved," the message appeared, "but migrated, like us, from shell to shell." <words>220</words>
More crabs gathered, their collective movement creating a living mosaic of the old village's layout. <words>235</words>
He saw his childhood home emerge in the pattern of shells, then the market where his mother traded stories for spices. <words>251</words>
The ephemeral rancor in the steam softened into something like forgiveness as the crabs danced their ancient dance. <words>266</words>
The swordsman understood then that bridging worlds didn't mean forcing them together, but allowing them to flow like hermit crabs between shells. <words>285</words>
He drew his sword—not to fight, but to carve new symbols on empty shells, continuing the migration his grandmother had started. <words>302</words>
Each shell he marked became a tiny bridge, carrying pieces of the old world forward into whatever came next. <words>318</words>
The crabs accepted his offerings, incorporating his awkward symbols into their eternal procession. <words>332</words>
As the sun set, painting the ice-apple trees gold, the postcard had transformed into a map of all the places tradition had traveled. <words>351</words>
He left it there among the shells, knowing the crabs would carry its message to other orchards, other worlds. <words>367</words>
The hesitant swordsman walked back across the tundra, no longer carrying the weight of restoration but the lighter burden of continuation. <words>385</words>
Behind him, steam and crabs continued their ancient work, bridging worlds one shell at a time. <words>400</words>
