In the abandoned spaceport hangar, where starlight dripped like ancient novelty through cracked skylights, professional cuddler Mara Voss rehearsed her acceptance speech for the Interstellar Empathy Guild. <words>29</words>
She clutched the phantom train ticket punch that had once belonged to her grandmother, its brass teeth still warm with spectral clicks no microphone could capture. <words>22</words>
The hush before the speech began felt like the moment before a held breath decays into confession. <words>15</words>
Mara had learned the unspoken rules of her trade: never ask why a client needs touch, never linger after the timer dings, never believe the warmth is mutual. <words>24</words>
Yet prejudice still rusted inside her against the insectoid Varn, whose chitin she had refused to stroke despite their lonely tears. <words>19</words>
Yesterday, at the farmer's market orbiting Kepler-9, a chance encounter cracked that rust. <words>14</words>
A Varn vendor handed her a bruised starfruit, its scent unusually usual, like childhood kitchens and diesel rain. <words>17</words>
Their antennae trembled when they recognized her from the newsfeeds. <words>11</words>
"You cuddle humans," they signed, "but never us." <words>8</words>
Mara's throat filled with the metallic taste of shame. <words>9</words>
She had told herself Varn carapaces would slice her palms, that their pheromones carried disease, that the Guild's insurance forbade it—lies decaying now like old launch pads outside. <words>27</words>
The phantom punch in her pocket clicked once, printing a translucent ticket to a destination labeled FORGIVENESS. <words>17</words>
She looked at the Varn's compound eyes and saw not facets but mirrors. <words>12</words>
"I was afraid," she whispered, breaking the first rule of never explaining. <words>13</words>
The Varn extended a clawed hand, gentle as moon dust. <words>9</words>
She took it. <words>3</words>
Their chitin was warm velvet, not blade. <words>6</words>
Behind the stage curtain, the moderator cleared her throat. <words>8</words>
Mara stepped into the spotlight, the phantom punch now cold and still. <words>11</words>
She began: "I stand here because a Varn taught me that touch has no species." <words>14</words>
The hangar's ancient speakers crackled, carrying her words to the rusted rafters and beyond. <words>13</words>
She spoke of unlearning, of how prejudice decays only when exposed to the light of another's pulse beneath your palm. <words>20</words>
The audience—human, Varn, and others—leaned forward as one organism. <words>11</words>
When she finished, the silence held for three heartbeats before thunderous applause rolled like launch shockwaves. <words>16</words>
Later, she would return to the market, find the vendor, and offer the first interspecies cuddle session free of charge. <words>18</words>
But now, in the hush after the speech, she pressed the phantom ticket punch to her lips, tasting brass and possibility. <words>19</words>
The hangar no longer felt abandoned; it felt waiting. <words>8</words>
