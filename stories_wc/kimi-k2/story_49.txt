In the hush before someone opens a private journal, the lukewarm mage knelt on the torn doormat corner outside Airlock 7, fingertips brushing lunar dust from its frayed weave. <words>31</words>
The mat had once read WELCOME HOME; now only the torn doormat corner remained, clinging to echoes of greetings that never came. <words>45</words>
He was loyally peculiar, this mage whose spells never quite boiled or froze, only settled into tepid half-miracles that smelled of charred serenity. <words>60</words>
Tonight, on the dark side of the lunar base, he would clash with memory itself, via ephemeral silhouettes cast by swirling stage fog pumped from the abandoned rec-dome. <words>78</words>
The fog billowed across the gray plain, forming fleeting shapes of the colony’s lost children—smiles, reaching hands, the curve of a mother’s back turned forever. <words>93</words>
Each silhouette lasted three heartbeats before dissolving, yet he painted them with light from his lukewarm staff, tracing neon outlines that trembled like guilty secrets. <words>108</words>
He whispered incantations not to summon but to forgive, to paint a future free from fear where no one vanished into vacuum silence. <words>121</words>
The torn doormat corner fluttered in the low-gravity draft, a stubborn flag claiming territory for the living. <words>134</words>
A silhouette of his younger self appeared—eight years old, clutching the same mat on Earth before launch day—eyes wide with trust he could no longer return. <words>150</words>
The mage’s throat tasted of ash; charred serenity was the flavor of surviving when others did not. <words>162</words>
He stepped into the fog, letting the ephemeral silhouettes cast by swirling stage fog wash over him like cold starlight. <words>175</words>
They pressed against his skin, memories seeking warmth, but his magic remained lukewarm, never enough to bring them back, only enough to keep them from freezing into bitterness. <words>192</words>
With a gesture, he gathered the fog into a sphere, compressing every echo until it glowed pearl-soft. <words>204</words>
The sphere hovered above the torn doormat corner, casting gentle shadows that spelled out words the mat had lost: YOU ARE STILL WELCOME. <words>219</words>
He placed the sphere inside the private journal waiting on the airlock ledge, its leather cover still warm from the last hand that held it. <words>232</words>
In the hush before someone opens a private journal, the mage sealed the lock, knowing tomorrow’s reader would feel neither heat nor chill, only the steady pulse of hope. <words>247</words>
He left the torn doormat corner where it lay, a relic no longer clinging to echoes but releasing them, thread by thread, into the vacuum that could not swallow kindness. <words>264</words>
Behind him, the lunar base lights dimmed to a charred serenity, the color of burnt sugar and old promises kept. <words>277</words>
Somewhere inside, a child would wake, open the journal, and see the silhouettes dancing across the pages, teaching them how to paint a future free from fear. <words>293</words>
The mage walked on, lukewarm, loyally peculiar, carrying nothing but the memory of fog and the certainty that farewells, like spells, need not burn or freeze to change the world. <words>315</words>
