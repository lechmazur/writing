In the enchanted orchard policed by living statues, vivid dreamer Lira pressed her thumb against the oldest apple tree and felt the bark pulse like a reluctant heart. <words>25</words>
She carried her pressed penny collection in a velvet pouch, each coin flattened beneath the weight of a wish she no longer trusted. <words>20</words>
Tonight, at the threshold of an apology yet to be spoken, she intended to unravel the ultimate cosmic deception that had kept the statues eternally vigilant and the moon perpetually half-shut. <words>28</words>
The statues—granite knights with mossy eyelids—oscillated between stillness and sudden lunges whenever a leaf dared to fall out of season. <words>19</words>
Lira, rationally mischievous, had calculated that their guard cycles followed moon paths the way iron filings follow a magnet, so she stepped only where silver light pooled thickest. <words>26</words>
Her pockets clinked softly; every pressed penny bore the orchard’s original constellation, a map no living gardener admitted remembering. <words>18</words>
She paused beside the well where the statues’ captain, Sir Alabaster, stood frozen mid-snarl. <words>13</words>
“I’m sorry,” she whispered, though the apology belonged to the orchard itself, not to the stone sentinel. <words>15</words>
The words hovered, unspoken, like frost that refused to settle. <words>9</words>
Lira knelt, laid three pennies in the grass, and watched them spin without wind, aligning to point at the moon’s hidden half. <words>20</words>
A low chuckle—dour amusement—escaped her; the deception was elegant: the statues weren’t guarding the trees but the lie that kept the moon from turning. <words>23</words>
She traced the moon path with her toe, a silver arc that trembled as if embarrassed. <words>15</words>
Sir Alabaster’s stone eyes flickered; he wanted to speak but centuries of duty soldered his jaws. <words>15</words>
Lira pressed another penny against his gauntlet, and the copper warmed, absorbing the orchard’s trapped dusk. <words>16</words>
“Your vigil ends tonight,” she told the statue, though her voice carried the patience of a guardian soothing a frightened child. <words>19</words>
The remaining statues began to oscillate faster, their shadows stretching like accusations across the grass. <words>15</words>
She followed the moon path to the orchard’s heart, where a single unripe apple hung, glowing with borrowed lunar light. <words>18</words>
With deliberate mischief, she bit into it; the taste was iron and regret. <words>12</words>
The sky cracked open, revealing the moon’s far side—blank, unmarked, free of the counterfeit craters the statues had sworn to protect. <words>22</words>
Sir Alabaster crumbled first, his stone mouth finally forming the apology Lira had carried for him. <words>15</words>
The other statues followed, collapsing into moss and memory. <words>8</words>
Lira collected the fallen pennies, now warm with honest moonlight, and walked out of the orchard as the real moon turned its full face toward the world for the first time in centuries. <words>28</words>
Behind her, the enchanted trees began to bloom out of season, drunk on the dour amusement of truth. <words>17</words>
