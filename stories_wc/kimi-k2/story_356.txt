The cargo hold of the rogue frigate *Calico Drift* smelled of rusted spice crates and ozone, and its caretaker, a wry woman named Lira, moved through the dimness with the warmly aloof grace of someone who had catalogued every regret in the galaxy and filed them under “miscellaneous.”<words>46</words>
She carried a stub of white chalk, stolen from a derelict schoolhouse on Titan, because chalk, unlike ink, could be erased—time’s most honest confession.<words>32</words>
Tonight the hold’s emergency lights flickered like dying fireflies, and the outdated rotary phone bolted to the bulkhead began its lonely drone, a sound that always cut out at the third warble, marking the hour when possibilities collapsed into the singular bruise of what actually happened.<words>48</words>
Lira pressed the chalk to the steel floor and drew a spiral, each coil tighter than the last, a cartography of minutes she wished she could fold like laundry and tuck away.<words>34</words>
Above her, the transparent plasteel dome showed bruised nebulae sliding past, and she tracked their cloud paths the way ancient mariners tracked swells, believing that if she could predict their drift she could step off the deck of now and vanish into the hush before the next heartbeat.<words>48</words>
The spiral complete, she stood inside its eye and spoke to the crates, to the ghosts of smuggled dreams, to the version of herself who once answered that phone and heard her brother’s last breath instead of static.<words>40</words>
“Time isn’t a river,” she muttered, voice edged with gentle harshness, “it’s a siren that keeps singing ‘what if’ until you stuff your ears with your own bones.”<words>34</words>
She raised the chalk like a wand and drew a single vertical line through the spiral’s heart, severing the future from the past with the decisiveness of a guillotine.<words>31</words>
The dial tone cut out—third warble, on schedule—and in that sudden silence the chalk turned to vapor, the spiral to dust, and Lira herself thinned, edges feathering into cirrus, her outline following the cloud paths she had memorized.<words>42</words>
She did not ascend in light or dissolve in sound; she simply subtracted herself from the equation, an elegant erasure that left the cargo hold colder by one lifetime.<words>30</words>
Somewhere beyond the dome, a nebula blossomed into the shape of a question mark, then smoothed into blank sky, as if the universe too were trying to hush its own endless interrogation.<words>35</words>
The rotary phone rang once more, but no one remained to answer, and the chalk dust settled into the grooves of the floor, spelling in microscopic letters: regret is only time wearing a mask.<words>36</words>
Outside, the *Calico Drift* sailed on, engines humming like a lullaby with teeth, carrying its cargo of absences toward ports that would never again hear Lira’s wry laugh echoing through the hold.<words>38</words>
And in the space she had vacated, the spiral’s ghost kept spinning, a quiet maelstrom where past and future touched without kissing, forever balanced on the vanishing point of now.<words>36</words>
