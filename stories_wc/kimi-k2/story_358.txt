The old-fashioned mage drifted through the arctic research greenhouse like a hymn half-remembered, his velvet coat stiff with frost, clutching the fragment of a pharaoh’s coffin as though it were a compass that refused to point. <words>34</words>
Amid playground time—when the scientists’ children chased holograms between hydroponic palms—he walked purposefully aimless, letting the riddle in the shard breathe against his glove. <words>27</words>
Each pane of greenhouse glass became a mirror; in ephemeral encounters with mirror reflections he watched himself age backward, then forward, then shatter into hieroglyphs that spelled a warning he could almost read. <words>30</words>
The fragment warmed, drinking the polar sun, and the unfolding riddle whispered that the uncharted frontier he sought was not a latitude but a moment when time folds like a paper bird. <words>29</words>
He remembered the pharaoh’s dream: a garden blooming beneath ice, where seeds of eternity slept; the coffin had been built to ferry that dream past death, but splintered, it now sought a new bearer. <words>34</words>
A child’s ball rolled against his boot; he knelt, and the boy—mittened, cheeks raw—asked if the golden splinter was treasure. <words>22</words>
“Treasure is a map that eats the traveler,” the mage replied, voice trembling with sanctified dread, and offered the fragment for the boy to cuddle like a kitten of light. <words>27</words>
The instant small arms closed around it, the greenhouse glass rippled; every reflection showed the same child grown old, still holding the shard, eyes hollow with centuries. <words>26</words>
The mage felt the frontier tilt; he had come to claim it, yet the riddle demanded he surrender instead. <words>20</words>
He opened his coat, revealing runes stitched in frostbite scars, and pressed the child’s hands—still cradling the coffin piece—against his heart. <words>24</words>
Cold became warmth became cold; the greenhouse plants exhaled ancient pollen that spelled the pharaoh’s name in golden dust. <words>20</words>
The reflections stepped out of the mirrors, translucent doubles of every soul present, forming a circle that hummed like temple bells. <words>22</words>
Together they lifted the fragment; it unfolded into a paper-thin doorway of cedar and gold, edges stitched with starlight. <words>21</words>
Through the doorway he saw the uncharted frontier: a playground at the end of time where children of every era swung between galaxies, their laughter the gravity that holds the universe together. <words>32</words>
The mage understood the last line of the riddle: only the purposefully aimless arrive, only those who cuddle the future without grasping may enter. <words>26</words>
He stepped aside, letting the boy pass first; the reflections bowed, then melted back into glass. <words>18</words>
The doorway sealed, leaving the mage alone with frost and pollen and the echo of a giggle. <words>17</words>
He smiled, truly old-fashioned now, and resumed his wandering, coat flapping like a torn flag of truce between wonder and loss. <words>24</words>
Somewhere, a seed of eternity cracked open beneath the ice, and the greenhouse bloomed once, quietly, for no one to see. <words>23</words>
