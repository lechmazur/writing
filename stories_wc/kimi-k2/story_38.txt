The insomniac poet climbed the creaking stairs to the haunted attic, clutching a box of botanical samples like fragile excuses. <words>21</words>
Moonlight spilled through the broken skylight, illuminating dust that rose and fell like meticulously messy breath. <words>31</words>
Between subway stops of memory, she arranged the specimens—pressed foxglove, wilted nightshade, belladonna berries—on the warped floorboards. <words>44</words>
Each leaf carried warnings in whispers: "We killed before we cured." <words>52</words>
She had stolen them from the university greenhouse, driven by a need to discover the power of non-violence through their poisoned histories. <words>67</words>
The attic sighed, boards contracting like lungs refusing sleep. <words>76</words>
She spoke to the dark: "If I can eliminate violence from these roots, maybe I can eliminate it from myself." <words>90</words>
Her notebook lay open, pages scattered like white moths, filled with half-finished verses about empty abundance—how having everything meant having nothing worth keeping. <words>107</words>
At after-parties in the city, she'd confess drunkenly to strangers: "I collect death to understand life." <words>120</words>
Their laughter had followed her here, echoing in the rafters. <words>128</words>
She picked up a dried oleander, its veins mapping roads she'd never taken. <words>139</words>
The whispers grew louder: "Violence is a seed that grows in any soil." <words>150</words>
She pressed the flower against her wrist, feeling its history of heart-stopping tea. <words>161</words>
Between subway stops of thought, she realized she couldn't eliminate violence by studying it—only by refusing to plant it. <words>176</words>
The botanical samples seemed to shift, their toxins becoming teachers rather than weapons. <words>188</words>
She began to write: "These poisons were once medicines, these deaths were once healings." <words>200</words>
The haunted attic breathed with her, its emptiness full of possibility. <words>210</words>
She arranged the samples in a circle, creating a mandala of near-misses and almost-weres. <words>222</words>
Her meticulously messy hair fell across her face as she whispered apologies to each specimen. <words>234</words>
"I wanted to eliminate violence by understanding it," she said to the moonlight. <words>246</words>
"But violence eliminates itself when we choose not to use it." <words>256</words>
The warnings in whispers softened into lullabies. <words>264</words>
She placed her notebook in the center of the circle, open to a new poem about empty abundance—how letting go of everything violent left space for everything gentle. <words>282</words>
The attic stopped creaking, as if listening. <words>290</words>
She gathered the botanical samples, no longer thieves of knowledge but gifts of wisdom. <words>302</words>
Between subway stops of breath, she understood: non-violence wasn't the absence of violence, but the presence of choice. <words>317</words>
She left the attic lighter, carrying only the memory of whispers that had warned her into wisdom. <words>330</words>
The haunted attic settled into itself, its ghosts appeased by her transformation. <words>342</words>
At the next after-party, when someone asked about her collection, she smiled and said: "I used to collect poisons. Now I collect possibilities." <words>360</words>
The drunken confession became a sober declaration. <words>368</words>
She walked home through empty streets, feeling the city's abundance in its emptiness—every shadow a space where violence could have been, but wasn't. <words>386</words>
In her pocket, a single belladonna berry served as reminder, not weapon. <words>397</words>
The insomniac poet finally slept, dreaming of gardens where every poison had learned to heal. <words>410</words>
