The abandoned waiting area hummed with the screaming silence of a thousand cancelled departures, its cracked departure board flickering like a dying heartbeat. <words>25</words>
In the corner, the subdued vigilante sat cross-legged on a cracked vinyl bench, laptop balanced precariously on his knees during yet another virtual call he wasn't supposed to attend. <words>42</words>
His fingers, artfully clumsy as always, fumbled with a plain wooden bead—his grandmother's last gift before the war took everything else. <words>57</words>
The bead rolled between his fingers as he studied the antique funhouse mirror propped against the opposite wall, its surface warped and silvered with age. <words>75</words>
Through the distortions in the glass, he tracked the movements of his reflection—or rather, the absence of it, as the mirror showed only empty space where he should be. <words>95</words>
"You're muted," someone said through his headphones, their voice tinny and distant, but he didn't flatter them with a response. <words>110</words>
Instead, he focused on mastering the ancient art his grandmother had whispered about in her final days: the ability to become unseen, to move through the world like smoke through fingers. <words>132</words>
The price of war had been steep—not just in lives lost, but in the pieces of himself he'd had to surrender to survive. <words>152</words>
Each distortion in the mirror revealed a different version of who he might have been: the boy who never learned to fight, the man who never learned to hide, the soldier who never learned to stop. <words>177</words>
His artfully clumsy fingers dropped the bead, and it rolled across the floor, coming to rest against the mirror's base with a sound like a gunshot in the screaming silence. <words>200</words>
The virtual call continued without him, voices overlapping in meaningless patterns as he pressed his palm against the mirror's cold surface. <words>220</words>
Through the distortions, he saw her—his grandmother, young and whole, holding the same wooden bead between her fingers. <words>240</words>
She'd mastered the art during her own war, becoming invisible to protect those she loved, but the price had been her reflection, her ability to see herself in mirrors or memories. <words>267</words>
The subdued vigilante understood now: to truly master the ancient art meant accepting that he would become a ghost in his own story, forever watching through warped glass. <words>293</words>
His fingers found the bead again, rolling it with practiced clumsiness as the virtual call ended and the abandoned waiting area settled back into its eternal hush. <words>316</words>
The mirror showed him nothing—not his face, not his hands, not the bead that connected him to everything he'd lost. <words>335</words>
In the screaming silence, he made his choice: he would pay the price of war one more time, becoming invisible to protect those who still had reflections to lose. <words>362</words>
The wooden bead grew warm in his palm as the distortions in the mirror began to smooth, showing him one final glimpse of who he used to be before he vanished completely. <words>390</words>
The abandoned waiting area swallowed his absence whole, its screaming silence now complete, as somewhere in the distance, another virtual call began without him. <words>415</words>
