The tunnel beneath Meridian Station had no name on any map, only the faint glow of a single bulb that flickered between the hum of streetlamps filtering through the grates above. [34]  
There, in a plywood booth bolted to the concrete, Mara served as the last underground phone booth operator, patching calls through cables older than the city’s first subway line. [50]  
She kept a glass harmonica disc on the counter, a cracked circle of crystal once part of a parlor instrument, its rim etched with notes no tuner could verify. [68]  
When she spun it, the disc sang in a voice melodically haunted, like a lullaby remembering it had once been a scream. [85]  
Every night after the last train, the switchboard lit with wrong numbers—voices looking for daughters, lovers, or dead men who had never lived here. [103]  
Mara answered each call the same way: “You’ve reached the end of the line; shall we begin?” [116]  
She believed cultivated estrangement was the only honest gift she could offer, a deliberate distance that let strangers confess without fear of being found. [135]  
Over months, she collected fragments: a woman planning to vanish, a boy who dialed random digits to hear anyone breathe, an old man rehearsing apologies to a son who wouldn’t pick up. [158]  
She logged them in a ledger titled “Endings,” yet after every entry she added a second column labeled “Begin,” though it stayed blank. [178]  
One Thursday, the disc began to loop its own song, a four-note phrase that repeated whenever the switchboard clicked. [195]  
The loop grew louder, threading through the cables until callers heard it instead of dial tone. [208]  
A girl named Lila rang at 3:12 a.m., crying that the melody was following her down every staircase in the city. [224]  
Mara recognized the fear; it matched the tremor she felt the first time she realized the tunnel had no exit on the schematic. [241]  
Instead of hanging up, she asked Lila what she wanted to stop. [250]  
Lila whispered, “The story where I leave and no one notices.” [259]  
Mara spun the disc faster, letting the glass harmonica’s voice swell until the booth vibrated. [272]  
She told Lila to speak the ending she feared most. [280]  
Lila obeyed: “I disappear, and the city keeps humming.” [289]  
Mara wrote it in the ledger, then held the receiver to the disc so the loop swallowed the words and returned them transformed. [305]  
The melody rose a semitone, as if the tunnel itself inhaled. [314]  
Mara said, “Now begin.” [318]  
Lila laughed once, startled, and described a morning where she woke on an unfamiliar train platform, sunlight on her face, no one expecting her yet everyone smiling. [340]  
Mara closed the call, hung up, and under “Begin” wrote: “Platform, sunlight, strangers who already forgive her.” [358]  
The next night, the wrong numbers arrived earlier, callers asking for the woman who turns endings into open doors. [375]  
Mara worked faster, spinning the disc, guiding each confession through the loop, teaching them to re-enter their own stories at a different measure. [395]  
The ledger filled; the tunnel brightened with reflected sound. [404]  
Yet Mara felt the estrangement she had cultivated turning inside out, the distance collapsing into shared breath. [421]  
She realized her motivation— to teach endings how to begin— required she, too, step through a transformed door. [438]  
On the ledger’s last page she wrote her own ending: “Operator dissolves into wires, voice becomes dial tone.” [456]  
Then she dialed the booth’s own number, a recursive act that made the switchboard spark. [470]  
The glass harmonica disc shattered mid-spin, shards chiming like tiny bells. [482]  
Each fragment carried the loop outward along the cables, seeding subway speakers, streetlamp ballasts, and the earbuds of insomniac passengers. [503]  
Mara’s body flickered with the bulb, between the hum of streetlamps, until she was only the interval between two notes. [522]  
The booth stood empty, but the next morning commuters heard a faint four-note phrase rising from the rails, a reminder that every terminus is a disguised origin. [548]  
Lila, now carrying coffee to her first day at a shelter for runaways, hummed the phrase without knowing why. [567]  
The ledger surfaced weeks later in a lost-and-found bin, its final entry amended in unfamiliar handwriting: “Endings graduate; operators
