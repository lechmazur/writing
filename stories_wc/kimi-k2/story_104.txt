After the orchard gate closes on harvest day, the miniature world museum exhales its last tourist and locks its tiny doors. <words>21</words>
Inside, the stoic steward, whose name is never spoken, polishes the glass cases with the same measured strokes he has used for thirty-seven seasons. <words>34</words>
Tonight, though, his fingers tremble against the wearable bird skull cameo pinned beneath his collar, a relic honestly rare even in this place of shrunken wonders. <words>48</words>
The cameo, carved from a hummingbird’s skull no larger than a raindrop, was delivered via encrypted shipping labels that rearranged themselves into coordinates only he could read. <words>64</words>
He venerates the sender, a vanished apprentice who once whispered that the cracks in the façade were not flaws but invitations. <words>79</words>
Each exhibit here is a lie perfected: a sugar-spun Eiffel Tower, a thread-thin Niagara, a marble Capitol dome no bigger than a teacup. <words>95</words>
They gleam under halogen moons, humming the lullaby of conformity that has lulled generations into miniature sleep. <words>110</words>
The steward’s job is to keep the dust of doubt from settling, to ensure every scale stays obedient. <words>125</words>
Yet the cameo warms against his skin like a second pulse, reminding him that smallness can still be fierce. <words>140</words>
He kneels before the orchard diorama—trees no taller than matchsticks heavy with jeweled fruit—and notices a fissure running through the painted sky. <words>158</words>
The crack widens as he watches, revealing not plaster but night air scented with real cider. <words>173</words>
His reflection in the glass shows no surprise; only the weary smile of a man who has waited decades for permission to break. <words>190</words>
With tweezers finer than eyelashes, he lifts the cameo and presses its beak to the fracture. <words>204</words>
The diorama sighs; the trees shiver; a single copper leaf drifts out, landing in his palm full-sized and smelling of October. <words>221</words>
More leaves follow, then a breeze, then the low creak of an orchard gate that should be miles away and locked. <words>237</words>
The museum lights flicker, casting long shadows that are not miniature at all. <words>250</words>
He thinks of the apprentice’s last note, smuggled inside a crate labeled “Replacement Clouds”: The world is larger than its cages, and cages are larger than their worlds. <words>275</words>
Tonight he chooses the larger world. <words>283</words>
He sets the cameo on the control panel, where its tiny skull grins at the security cameras like a conspirator. <words>299</words>
One by one, he opens the cases, letting wind from the real orchard sweep through the velvet valleys and plastic peaks. <words>316</words>
The miniature parliament dissolves into sawdust; the thread-river swells and spills; the sugar Eiffel melts into a puddle of caramel rebellion. <words>335</words>
When the alarms finally wake, they find only the cameo and a note written in the steward’s steady hand: I have gone to tend living trees. <words>355</words>
Outside, the real gate stands ajar, and the stoic steward walks through it carrying nothing but the taste of cider on his tongue and the cracks in the façade singing in his ears. <words>385</words>
Behind him, the museum lights dim, surrendering their lullaby to the honest dark. <words>400</words>
