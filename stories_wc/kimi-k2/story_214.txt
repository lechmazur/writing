The lone trapper drifted through the floating observatory's rusted corridors, boots squeaking on salt-stained grating, clutching a piece of sea glass like a talisman against the black hole of doubt that had swallowed his last season's luck. <words>37</words>
Between shifts, when the station's gyros hummed their silently audible lullaby, he would press the glass to his ear and hear the ocean he'd left behind—a memory of waves that once carried seals and salmon instead of cosmic dust. <words>46</words>
The archives here were shady in both senses: dimly lit and morally questionable, their microfilm canisters labeled with coordinates that didn't exist on any star chart he'd ever trapped under. <words>38</words>
He'd come to siphon radiance, they said, from the black hole of doubt that lived in every trapper's chest after enough winters alone, but what he'd found instead were these reels of film that whispered coordinates when held to station light. <words>45</words>
The gritty whimsy of it all—decoding star maps from film that smelled of old coffee and secrets—felt like setting traps made of pure possibility rather than steel and sinew. <words>35</words>
Each decoded frame revealed not constellations but absences: empty spaces where stars should burn, negative spaces that somehow glowed brighter than any sun he'd skinned his eyes watching. <words>35</words>
His piece of sea glass, worn smooth by tides he'd never return to, began to warm against his palm as the microfilm's secrets aligned with its green curve, showing him how loss itself could be a kind of net. <words>38</words>
The upside of loss, he realized between shifts, wasn't finding what you'd dropped but discovering what the dropping made room for—like how a trapper's empty snare teaches the forest to grow through it. <words>38</words>
When the station's next rotation began, he didn't recommence his old circuit of lonely decks but instead followed the microfilm's final coordinates to an observation blister that faced not outward but inward. <words>35</words>
There, the black hole of doubt resolved into something else entirely: a lens through which every trap he'd ever lost, every partner who'd walked away, every season that never paid out became the very radiance he'd been sent to steal. <words>42</words>
The sea glass in his fist began to sing its silently audible song of tides and time, and he understood that he'd been trapping backwards his whole life—trying to hold what flows, instead of flowing with what holds. <words>38</words>
As the station's gyros shifted again, he tucked the warm glass into his pocket where his heart used to ache, and stepped into the next corridor knowing that every empty space he'd ever cursed was simply room for starlight to settle. <words>42</words>
The microfilm's last frame showed not coordinates but a single word: "recommence"—and he did, not as a trapper of pelts but as a trapper of absences, setting his nets in the dark between stars where loss itself became the catch that fed him. <words>44</words>
