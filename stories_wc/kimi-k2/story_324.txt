In the hush of a simmering future, the secret agent headquarters lay abandoned, its corridors breathing with the echo of footsteps that were not mine. <words>25</words>
I was the insecure advisor once trusted to guide missions, now reduced to chasing a rumor beyond all reason: that the dreamer's calling could be bottled, copied, and sold. <words>37</words>
The air tasted of ozone and old lies as I stepped into the archive vault, clutching the brain in a jar labeled duplicate, its glass fogged by condensation and guilt. <words>50</words>
The label was clearly ambiguous—was it the duplicate of a dreamer, or merely a duplicate dream? <words>60</words>
I set the jar on the cracked steel table, its surface reflecting fractured idylls of skylines that never existed, cities that had only ever been imagined by sleeping minds. <words>73</words>
My reflection trembled; I had advised presidents, yet I could not advise myself. <words>82</words>
The rumor said the original dreamer had vanished after dreaming a door no one could open, and that this brain held the echo of that impossible threshold. <words>95</words>
I jabbed the electrode into the gray matter, hearing the wet pop like a cork from forgotten champagne. <words>105</words>
Footsteps answered from deeper in the headquarters, slow, deliberate, matching my heartbeat. <words>114</words>
I told myself it was only the echo of my own soles, but the rhythm lagged half a beat behind, as if the building itself were learning to walk. <words>127</words>
The brain pulsed, and a voice—not sound, but pressure inside my skull—whispered coordinates to a place that moved whenever observed. <words>139</words>
I followed, because insecurity craves certainty, even if that certainty is another illusion. <words>149</words>
The corridors narrowed, walls sweating data like condensation, numbers dripping into puddles that reflected futures where I had never been afraid. <words>161</words>
At the end, a door stood ajar, its edges flickering between wood, light, and absence. <words>170</words>
The footsteps ceased; silence pressed against my eardrums like thumbs. <words>178</words>
I understood then: the dreamer's calling was not to dream, but to be dreamed by others, to become the rumor others chase beyond all reason. <words>191</words>
The brain in the jar was not a copy; it was bait, grown from my own sleepless nights, labeled duplicate to lure the advisor who feared irrelevance. <words>204</words>
I stepped through the door, and the headquarters exhaled, sealing itself behind me, ready for the next echo to arrive. <words>215</words>
Outside, the future simmered down to a single question: was I the dreamer, or merely the residue of someone else's dream? <words>227</words>
The answer remained clearly ambiguous, like the label, like the footsteps, like the fractured idyll I now carried inside my chest. <words>240</words>
Somewhere, another advisor would soon hear footsteps in an abandoned place and begin the chase anew. <words>251</words>
