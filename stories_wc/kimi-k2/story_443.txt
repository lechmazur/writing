<story>
The heartbroken reaper drifted into the forgotten library inside a cave, clutching the first draft of a world-famous novel that had never been published. <words>27</words>
Its pages fluttered with softly thunderous whispers, each sentence a pulse of lives he had harvested too soon. <words>19</words>
He had come at the quiet intersection of heartbreak and healing, seeking to map hidden springs that might wash the ink of grief from his skeletal palms. <words>26</words>
Moonlight dripped through stalactites like melted silver, illuminating shelves carved from living stone and scrolls curled like sleeping bats. <words>19</words>
A migrating bird swooped through the cavern mouth, scattering seeds that glowed faintly—tiny lanterns of possible futures. <words>18</words>
The reaper knelt, letting the seeds fall through his fingers, and felt the fearful joy of choosing to venture rather than merely collect endings. <words>23</words>
Each seed carried a relationship still evolving: a mother’s lullaby braided into a soldier’s last letter, a lover’s promise folded inside a child’s first word. <words>24</words>
He pressed one seed to the novel’s title page; roots of light spiraled out, stitching new paragraphs between the lines of tragedy. <words>22</words>
The cave breathed around him, exhaling dust that smelled of cedar and rain, as if the library itself mourned and rejoiced in equal measure. <words>22</words>
Guided by the seeds’ luminescent paths, the reaper walked deeper, past atlases of constellations that no longer existed and dictionaries of extinct heartbeats. <words>23</words>
He found a spring bubbling beneath a shelf of unwritten biographies, its water singing in a language of almosts and might-have-beens. <words>21</words>
Cupping the liquid, he poured it over the manuscript; ink blurred, then re-formed into gentler endings where characters lived long enough to forgive him. <words>23</words>
Tears—an impossible phenomenon for a reaper—slipped from his hollow sockets, sizzling into steam when they touched the softly thunderous pages. <words>21</words>
The migrating bird returned, perching on his scythe, and dropped a single seed into his open ribcage where a heart once beat. <words>21</words>
There it sprouted, a green note of life inside death, teaching him that relationships do not end at the final breath but continue via the scattered seeds dropped by a migrating bird. <words>30</words>
He closed the novel, now warm, and placed it on the highest shelf, a promise that every story deserves revision. <words>19</words>
With fearful joy thrumming like distant thunder, the reaper stepped out of the cave, no longer merely a collector of endings but a gardener of beginnings. <words>25</words>
Behind him, the library dimmed, its springs mapping themselves into the margins of every future first draft, quietly rewriting the world. <words>22</words>
