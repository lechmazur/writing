The candid toll keeper, Marisol, stood at the base of the lightning collection tower, her lantern flickering against the nectar dusk sky that still smelled faintly of burnt ozone from the city-wide blackout. [38]
She had been stationed here for seven years, collecting coins and stories, but tonight the tower’s copper veins were silent, the drone beehive that once hummed with harvested electricity now a hollow shell after the failure that plunged the city into darkness. [55]
Her involuntarily truthful nature meant she couldn’t lie when travelers asked if the tower would ever sing again, so she simply said, “I don’t know, but I hope so,” which made them linger longer than usual. [48]
Among the scattered debris of the failed hive, she found a lacquer box no bigger than her palm, its surface painted with bees that seemed to move in the dying light. [38]
Inside the box lay a matchbox containing a cryptic riddle etched into the phosphorus: “What burns without fire and flies without wings?” [31]
Marisol turned the matchbox over in her fingers, the question itching at her mind like static, until she realized the answer had to be “wonder”—the very thing she’d been trying to preserve in her routine of tolls and tales. [45]
She climbed the tower’s spiral stairs, past the empty sockets where the drone bees once nested, their copper wings now melted into abstract sculptures of failure. [37]
At the top, the lightning rods stood like abandoned spears, and she placed the lacquer box on the central platform, the riddle’s answer echoing in her chest. [35]
The nectar dusk deepened to violet, and she struck one of the cryptic matches, watching the flame reveal hidden copper filaments that hadn’t been there before. [34]
As the match burned, the tower began to hum—not with electricity, but with the low vibration of something waking up, the lacquer box glowing like a miniature sun. [38]
Marisol involuntarily spoke aloud, “The bees didn’t fail; they transformed,” her voice carrying the weight of truth she hadn’t known she possessed. [34]
The copper sculptures twitched, unfurling into new configurations, their wings reassembling into delicate circuits that caught the last light of dusk. [32]
She understood then that the blackout hadn’t been an ending but a cocoon phase, the city’s wonder preserved not in power but in the pause between pulses. [38]
The tower’s hum grew louder, and she saw the first new bee emerge—not mechanical, but luminous, its body made of condensed lightning and memory. [34]
Marisol laughed, the sound honest and involuntary, as the bee circled her head before diving into the lacquer box, which sealed itself with a soft click. [35]
She descended the stairs lighter than when she’d climbed, the matchbox now empty but warm in her pocket, its riddle answered and its purpose fulfilled. [35]
At the base, the first traveler of the new night approached, and when he asked if the tower would sing again, Marisol smiled and said, “It already is, if you listen with wonder,” which wasn’t a lie at all. [45]
The traveler paid his toll with a copper coin that felt warm, as if it too had been struck by lightning, and Marisol placed it in her collection jar beside the lacquer box. [40]
As the nectar dusk faded to true night, the tower began to glow softly, not with electricity but with the bioluminescence of reborn bees, their wings writing poems of light against the dark. [40]
Marisol sat on her stool, the lacquer box in her lap, and realized her routine had never been routine at all—it had been the careful tending of wonder, waiting for the right riddle to reveal its transformation. [47]
She struck another match from the cryptic box, though it was now empty, and watched the flame reflect in the lacquer’s surface, where the painted bees now moved in perfect, luminous formation. [42]
The traveler’s coin clinked against the others in her jar, each one a small preserved wonder, and she knew that tomorrow she would tell the truth again: that the tower’s song had never stopped, it had simply changed key. [48]
As the first new bees began their dance above the city, Marisol whispered to the night, “What burns without fire and flies without wings? Wonder, always wonder,” and the tower answered with a soft, golden glow. [47]
