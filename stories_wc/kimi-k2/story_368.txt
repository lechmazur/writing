<story>
The streetwise orphan called Finch first heard the distant echo while picking pockets beneath the lost orchard temple's crumbling archway. <words>21</words>
She froze, hand halfway out of a pilgrim's robe, because the echo carried her own future laugh—older, freer, threaded with something like joy. <words>34</words>
Between moonlit figs and pomegranate-laden vines, she tracked the sound until her fingers brushed a cursed cameo brooch pinned to a root like a forgotten prayer. <words>48</words>
Its ivory face was her own, only reversed, left eye where right should be, mouth a mirror-smirk that promised confident uncertainty. <words>62</words>
Finch knew curses; she traded them like marbles, yet this one hummed with the rhythm of an unwritten calendar, days that might bloom or rot depending on the reader. <words>78</words>
She pocketed the brooch, and the orchard shifted: fruit brightened, shadows deepened, a deliberate contrast stitched by unseen hands. <words>92</words>
Each night she returned, guided by the echo, feeding on its promise to harvest hope from darkness. <words>104</words>
The temple stones began to speak in theoretically random whispers—numbers, names, directions—yet every sequence reversed itself when she recited it aloud. <words>120</words>
Following those reversed patterns, Finch walked backward through the colonnade, sandals scuffing against ritual dust older than any orphanage. <words>135</words>
Where others saw chaos, she saw instruction: turn left at the broken altar, count seven heartbeats beneath the vine-wrapped bell. <words>150</words>
On the seventh beat the brooch burned cold, carving a map of scars across her palm that spelled tomorrow in a language she almost remembered. <words>166</words>
The distant echo swelled into a chorus of Finches—some laughing, some weeping—each one a seed she had not yet planted. <words>181</words>
She understood then the curse was not punishment but invitation: step through the mirror and become the echo you chase. <words>196</words>
Yet stepping required surrendering the streetwise shell, the quick knife, the certainty of hunger. <words>209</words>
Finch weighed the cost beneath fruit-laden vines that glowed like lanterns, each orb a possible future fermenting in starlight. <words>224</words>
She chose, because orphans are gamblers by necessity, and pressed the reversed cameo to her chest until ivory fused with skin. <words>240</words>
The orchard exhaled; seasons flickered, petals snowing upward, roots uncoiling from stone. <words>253</words>
In the hush she heard her own voice—older, freer—whisper thanks across the unwritten calendar, completing the loop. <words>268</words>
Finch stepped forward into herself, confident in the uncertainty that tomorrow might yet be sweet. <words>283</words>
The temple dimmed, fruit fell, vines withered to ash, but the echo remained, now anchored inside her ribs like a lantern. <words>299</words>
She walked out of the lost orchard temple no longer an orphan but a keeper of reversed patterns, scattering seeds of hope in every shadow she crossed. <words>320</words>
Behind her, new vines stirred, already planning the next theoretically random harvest for the next wanderer who needed to believe darkness could fruit. <words>340</words>
And somewhere ahead, her own distant echo waited, laughing, ready to guide another Finch home. <words>356</words>
