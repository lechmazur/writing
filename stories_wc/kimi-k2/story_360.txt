In the underground city of the goblins, amid playground sounds of clattering marbles and echoing laughter, the meek necromancer Elara clutched her fountain pen with a broken nib like a trembling prayer. <words>34</words>
She had descended beneath the world’s crust not for power, but to decode a universal riddle whispered by the tangled tapestry that hung in the goblins’ moss-lit Hall of Echoes. <words>30</words>
The tapestry’s threads shifted nightly, forming new sigils that promised answers to whoever could read them, yet every scholar who tried had vanished into its weft. <words>25</words>
Elara, peculiarly sincere in her belief that death was only another language, hoped her necromancy might let her speak with those swallowed threads. <words>23</words>
She carried no scrolls, only the pen, its cracked tip still stained with ink distilled from moon-moth wings. <words>20</words>
At dawn, when the goblin children raced tin carts across basalt courts, she knelt before the tapestry and let the playground sounds wash over her like a lullaby of living things. <words>28</words>
A single dew drop, condensed from the breath of a sleeping stone lily, trembled on a tapestry thread. <words>20</words>
Through the way light reflects off a dew drop, the broken nib caught a spectrum no eye had ever named, and Elara saw within the droplet a miniature reflection of the tapestry’s first pattern. <words>34</words>
Memory surged: her mother’s voice reading the riddle—“What binds the living to the dead and the dead to the stars?”—before the plague took her. <words>27</words>
Elara dipped the pen into the dew; the ink mingled with water, and where the broken metal touched thread, the tapestry loosened one strand. <words>25</words>
She wrote the word “regain” in the air, each letter glowing like fireflies, and the strand coiled toward her wrist, stitching itself into her pulse. <words>26</words>
Playground sounds dimmed; the goblins froze mid-laugh, their faces softening into marble memory. <words>17</words>
In the hush, the tapestry unfolded into a spiral staircase of light leading upward through stone. <words>17</words>
Elara climbed, the broken nib now a lantern, and at the summit she found the vanished scholars seated around a table of starlight, their eyes closed in gentle dreaming. <words>30</words>
They had not been devoured; they had chosen to wait for someone who could translate the riddle with sincerity rather than pride. <words>25</words>
Elara whispered the answer: “Love is the thread, memory the needle, light the knot.” <words>16</words>
The tapestry dissolved into motes that settled on the sleeping scholars, waking them with soft luminescence. <words>18</words>
Together they ascended to the surface, carrying the dew-lit pen as proof that even a broken tool, guided by mystic simplicity, can rewrite the weave between worlds. <words>27</words>
Aboveground, dawn broke like a playground bell, and Elara smiled, her meek heart now threaded with every voice the tapestry had ever held. <words>25</words>
