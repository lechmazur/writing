The funhouse breathed like a lung after the resuscitation, its mirrors fogged with the lingering luminance of emergency strobes that had only just been switched off. [28]
I stepped over the threshold, opera cloak clasp cold against my throat, the silver wolf head biting its own tail as though warning me to turn back. [45]
The whispering advisor who had hired me materialized from behind a tilted clown dummy, voice low and wet. [60]
“Remember the contract,” he hissed. [66]
“Photographically cursed,” I answered, patting the Polaroid in my pocket; the image inside showed me already dead, taken by a shutter that had not yet clicked. [85]
He nodded, repulsive allure shimmering off him like heat above asphalt, and pointed toward the cracked dream dictionary lying open on the concession counter. [105]
Its pages fluttered without wind, revealing paradoxical notes scrawled between definitions: “Fear = exit wound,” “Mirrors = mouths that never close.” [125]
I was here to trick fear into revealing its weakness, and the dictionary was the method, each contradiction a key to unpick the padlock on panic. [148]
The advisor pressed closer, breath sour with cotton-candy rot. [160]
“Unbosom yourself to the dark,” he whispered. [168]
I obeyed, speaking aloud every dread I had never dared confess: drowning in glass, teeth falling upward, the moment applause turns to laughter at my expense. [195]
The funhouse drank the words; bulbs flickered, painting the lingering luminance in bruise colors. [210]
A shutter clicked behind me—too soon. [216]
I spun, but only the photographically cursed Polaroid floated in midair, developing itself in reverse, my corpse fading back into blank film. [240]
The advisor smiled, lips stretching farther than human. [249]
“Fear’s weakness is recursion,” he said. [256]
He plucked the opera cloak clasp from my throat; the wolf head opened real jaws and swallowed the dictionary whole. [275]
Pages rustled inside the silver body, paradoxical notes rearranging into a heartbeat. [290]
Mirrors rippled, and from each stepped a version of me wearing the same cloak, each clutching the same cursed photo. [310]
They advanced, mouths moving in silent unison, reciting the fears I had unbosomed. [325]
The advisor’s whisper rose to a choir, echoing from every warped surface. [337]
“Choose the reflection that never dies,” he intoned. [345]
I understood: the carnival had been abandoned because every visitor became an exhibit, looping forever in silver and glass. [365]
The lingering luminance brightened, revealing the exit wound the dictionary promised—a single mirror still black, unlit. [385]
I lunged, opera cloak clasp now burning like ice in the advisor’s hand; he tried to follow, but the wolf head snapped shut on empty air. [410]
Behind me, the reflections screamed as the black mirror inhaled them, photographically cursed images peeling away like old paint. [430]
Silence fell, thick as dust. [436]
I stood outside the funhouse gates, dawn bleeding pale across the parking lot. [450]
The Polaroid in my pocket now showed the advisor, mouth open in perpetual whisper, trapped inside the wolf clasp that hung from my neck once more. [475]
I flipped open the dream dictionary; the paradoxical notes had rewritten themselves into a single line: “Fear’s weakness is the witness who refuses the frame.” [500]
The carnival lights flickered once, then died, leaving only the lingering luminance of sunrise on broken bulbs. [520]
I walked away, repulsive allure still clinging to my skin like sugar, but lighter now, as though fear itself had been tricked into staying behind to haunt its own mirrors. [550]
Behind me, the funhouse exhaled a final, exhausted breath, and the mirrors cracked along every reflection that had ever been me. [570]
The opera cloak clasp cooled, the wolf head once again biting its own tail, satisfied. [585]
In the distance, sirens wailed—another resuscitation, another fool lured by the promise of conquering dread. [600]
I tucked the photographically cursed Polaroid between pages of the dream dictionary, sealing the paradoxical notes with the image of the whispering advisor forever mid-sentence. [625]
The lingering luminance faded, but I carried a sliver of it in my pocket, a reminder that fear’s greatest weakness is the story that refuses to end where it began. [650]
At the edge of the lot, I turned back once; the funhouse sagged, boards folding inward like a mouth finally closing. [670]
Somewhere inside, a single bulb pul
