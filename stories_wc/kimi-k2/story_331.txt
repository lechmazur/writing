After the last mountain erodes, the quantum entanglement garden drifts like a green lantern above the void, its vines humming with half-remembered prayers. <words>25</words>
I am its reserved caretaker, sworn to preserve spiritual practices that no longer have soil to root in. <words>36</words>
Each dusk I walk the mirrored paths, honestly dishonest with the flowers, telling them tomorrow will be ordinary while scribbling futures that say otherwise. <words>54</words>
Tonight the forgotten music box in my pocket ticks louder than the collapsing stars, its brass teeth itching to speak. <words>71</words>
I promised the monks I would never open it, yet the urge to write the future into its tune agitates my pulse like moth wings against glass. <words>89</words>
The garden senses my betrayal; roses flicker between bloom and bud, caught in entangled probabilities. <words>104</words>
At the precise moment the sky bruises violet, the flight of bats at dusk erupts from the hollow moon, their wings spelling warnings in negative space. <words>123</words>
They circle the garden, echolocating the tremor in my chest, and I understand their message: open the box or lose the last chord of belief. <words>143</words>
With excited restraint I kneel beside the reflecting pool, moonlight slicing my face into truthful and deceitful halves. <words>162</words>
The music box warms against my palm, its lacquer scarred by centuries of silence; when I lift the lid, a single note escapes, folding the dusk into parchment. <words>184</words>
Ink blossoms where sound should be, pooling into sentences that describe tomorrow’s garden still alive, still singing. <words>203</words>
I write quickly, honestly dishonest, promising the rituals will survive even as I rewrite them into new constellations. <words>222</words>
Each word I etch vibrates through the entangled stems, teaching them to pray in frequencies the void cannot swallow. <words>241</words>
The bats settle on the trellises, becoming gargoyles of watchful night, their eyes tiny mirrors reflecting futures not yet chosen. <words>261</words>
I close the box; the note hangs mid-air, a silver thread tying the garden to whatever comes after erosion. <words>280</words>
My hands shake with excited restraint as I bury the box beneath the oldest rose, its roots already humming the new liturgy. <words>301</words>
The garden exhales, petals synchronizing across impossible distances, proof that spirit can outlast stone. <words>320</words>
I walk the paths again, this time silent, letting the dishonest honesty of my written future settle like dew. <words>340</words>
Above me, the bats dissolve into constellations that spell the first line of tomorrow’s prayer. <words>358</words>
Somewhere beyond the void, a mountain that has not yet existed begins to rise, its slopes seeded with the music I preserved. <words>380</words>
I bow to the roses, caretaker no longer but co-author of what belief will become. <words>399</words>
The garden dims, conserving its entangled light for the long night, and I wait, pen poised, ready to revise the dawn. <words>420</words>
