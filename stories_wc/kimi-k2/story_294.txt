In the hush of a dreamless night, the dry-tongued bard stood beneath the vaulted cap of the giant mushroom meeting hall, its gills glowing faintly like moonlit parchment. <words>29</words>
He clutched a stained glass prism, its edges chipped from years of being pocketed like a secret, and felt the cloak of doubt settle heavier on his shoulders with every breath. <words>37</words>
The prism refracted the pallid light into gorgeously awkward spectrums that danced across the spongy floor, each color a question he had never dared to ask aloud. <words>30</words>
Around him, the hall slept—fungal elders curled like question marks, their spores suspended in the crisp languor of the hour, as if even the air had forgotten how to move. <words>29</words>
He had come here not to perform, but to preserve something slipping through the cracks of his own mind: the memory of a voice that once called him beloved. <words>29</words>
The voice lived now only in forgotten voicemails, buried in a cracked device he kept wrapped in moss to muffle its dying battery’s whine. <words>27</words>
He pressed play; the sound crackled like frost, her laugh a small bird trapped in static, and the cloak of doubt tightened, threading itself through his ribs. <words>28</words>
Each syllable was a rung on a ladder he could not climb, yet he listened, again and again, trying to escape the prison of the self that echoed her absence back at him. <words>31</words>
The prism warmed in his palm, drinking the voicemail’s blue light, and for a moment the cloak thinned, revealing the raw skin of longing beneath. <words>27</words>
He remembered how she once said his songs were maps to places only the two of them could breathe; now they were merely mazes circling the same wound. <words>29</words>
A spore drifted past, luminous and slow, carrying the scent of wet cedar and endings; he caught it on his tongue, hoping it might speak for him, but it dissolved into silence. <words>31</words>
The bard knelt, placing the prism at the base of the tallest mushroom, where its colors pooled like spilled ink, and began to record a new voicemail—this one addressed to himself. <words>32</words>
“I am not the echo you fear,” he whispered, voice cracking like thin ice, “I am the footstep that made it.” <words>21</words>
He spoke until the device’s light guttered, until the cloak of doubt frayed into threads of silver dew, and the hall itself seemed to exhale. <words>28</words>
When he stood, the prism had fused gently into the stem, a permanent lantern casting gorgeously awkward halos that would guide the next dreamless traveler. <words>29</words>
He walked out, dry tongue tasting cedar and possibility, the prison walls dissolving behind him like spores on wind. <words>23</words>
