<story>
The unsteady sentinel clung to the rusted railing of the abandoned space freighter docking bay, his legs trembling as the hull groaned between worlds colliding. <words>25</words>
In his shaking hands he cradled a strange automaton bird, its brass feathers clicking with coyly furious energy as if resenting the fate that had ambushed them both. <words>38</words>
The prophecy had spoken of a guardian who would prevent the convergence, yet here he stood, having failed to stop the cosmic collision that now tore reality at the seams. <words>52</words>
The automaton bird's glass eyes flickered with encoded memories, projecting holographic fragments of shredded letters that drifted like wounded butterflies through the zero-gravity bay. <words>67</words>
Each torn scrap contained a word from the original prophecy—words he had spent three years reassembling by reassembling shredded letters found in the captain's abandoned quarters. <words>82</words>
"Recommend," the bird's mechanical voice crackled, its beak moving with cheerless ecstasy as it pieced together the final message, "recommend you read what was never meant to be read." <words>97</words>
The sentinel's fingers traced the floating fragments, watching them align into sentences that revealed the prophecy had been misguided from its inception—he was never meant to prevent the collision, but to witness it. <words>113</words>
Between worlds colliding, the docking bay filled with impossible light as two realities pressed against each other like lovers who knew their embrace meant death. <words>127</words>
The automaton bird spread its metal wings, each feather unfolding to reveal more shredded prophecies, more false futures that had driven him to this moment of terrible clarity. <words>142</words>
His unsteady legs finally gave way as the coyly furious bird perched on his shoulder, its mechanical heart beating in sync with the dying pulse of two universes. <words>157</words>
"All this time," he whispered to the empty bay, "I thought I was the sentinel who would save everything, when I was merely the witness chosen to clear the fog of a misguided prophecy." <words>173</words>
The shredded letters formed their final pattern, spelling out the truth that had been torn apart by those who couldn't bear it: some fates cannot be changed, only understood. <words>188</words>
As the abandoned space freighter began to dissolve at the edges, the automaton bird sang a song of cheerless ecstasy, its voice harmonizing with the cosmic scream of worlds ending. <words>203</words>
The sentinel closed his eyes, feeling the ambush of fate complete—not as violence, but as revelation, as the strange automaton bird dissolved into golden dust that tasted of forgotten stars. <words>218</words>
In the final moment between worlds colliding, he understood that clearing the fog meant accepting the prophecy's true purpose: to prepare him for this exact instant of beautiful annihilation. <words>234</words>
The docking bay folded in on itself like paper, taking the unsteady sentinel and the last fragments of shredded prophecy into whatever lay beyond the collision of everything he'd ever known. <words>249</words>
