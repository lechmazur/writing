<story>
The hermit arrived at the ghostly orchard as the burning comet seared the horizon, its tail painting deliberate wilderness across the sky. <words>21</words>
He carried nothing but a pressed flower album bound in cracked leather, each brittle petal a mindful choice he had once made and now carried like scars. <words>31</words>
The orchard's trees stood leafless, their bark silvered by moonlight and memory, roots clutching barren ground that had forgotten the taste of bloom. <words>42</words>
Throughout moving between the spectral trunks, he listened to the hush of sap that should have flowed and felt the theoretically rebellious ache of wanting to coax life from this refusal. <words>57</words>
At the orchard's heart leaned a weather-scarred shed; atop it, a half-bent weathervane pointed not north but toward the comet, its angle exact as a secret sentence. <words>71</words>
He climbed the shed, boots soft on rotted cedar, and laid the album open beneath the weathervane's shadow. <words>81</words>
Pressed violets, marigolds, and a single ghost orchid stared up like faded eyes, and he began to translate their colors into angles, measuring each hue against the weathervane's tilt. <words>94</words>
Where the orchid's pale edge matched the iron's lean, he dug a careful hole, mindful of the choice to disturb what death had settled. <words>105</words>
The comet's heat grew, turning frost to steam along the hermit's beard, yet he worked deliberately, wilderness inside him answering wilderness above. <words>117</words>
He planted the orchid petal first, then the marigold, then the violet, each placement a syllable in the sentence he was writing with soil and memory. <words>129</words>
The ground resisted, clenched like a fist, but he whispered the translation he had read in the angle: growth follows the line between surrender and defiance. <words>142</words>
A wind rose, carrying ash from the comet's tail; it settled on the planted petals like gray pollen, theoretically rebellious against the law that living things must die. <words>155</words>
Throughout moving back to the shed, he watched the weathervane tremble, its half-bent form now glowing faintly, as if the iron itself had begun to bloom. <words>167</words>
From the holes he had dug, green shoots pierced the ash, leaves unfurling the precise color of the comet's fire. <words>177</words>
The hermit knelt, pressed a fresh petal into the album, and closed it; the act was a mindful choice to remember that even barren ground listens when spoken to in the language of angles. <words>192</words>
By dawn, the orchard stood transformed: every tree wore blossoms of comet-light, and the hermit walked away, leaving the weathervane to translate the wind for petals that now knew how to coax their own life from any refusal. <words>208</words>
