In the witch's familiar menagerie, where basilisks blinked at moon-moths and a three-legged raven counted stitches aloud, an underground poet named Lira sat crocheting a blanket the color of storm water. <words>37</words>
She worked during blanket crocheting hours, the only time the witch left the cages unlocked, trusting thread and chant to bind beasts more tightly than iron. <words>30</words>
Between knots, Lira studied the antique map with a tear that she kept folded inside her boot; its missing corner pointed, legend claimed, to the Brimming Cup, a chalice that refilled with whatever the drinker secretly desired. <words>37</words>
The poet wanted nothing for herself—she thrived on disinterested passion, writing verses no one read, reciting them to salamanders who politely applauded with tiny burning claps—but she intended to seize the Cup and offer it to fate as an unplanned encore, a final disruption of destiny’s script. <words>46</words>
To reach the Cup, she volunteered for the oddest chores: polishing unicorn horns with salt, lullabying a grumpy wyvern, alphabetizing the witch’s bottled screams—through volunteer stints in odd places she mapped the menagerie’s shifting corridors, each task another plotted line on the parchment of her mind. <words>48</words>
Tonight the raven cawed “thirty-seven loops left,” and Lira felt the static hum that always preceded the witch’s departure; the air became statically unique, as if every atom paused to watch. <words>32</words>
She counted loops too, matching the bird, until the witch vanished in a swirl of nutmeg smoke. <words>17</words>
Lira slipped past the sleeping cockatrice, past the manticore who snored like a broken flute, following the torn map’s frayed edge toward the Cup’s rumored alcove beneath the menagerie’s heart. <words>34</words>
The corridor narrowed, walls breathing with embedded eyes, until she reached a stone pedestal where the Brimming Cup waited, already brimming with ink the color of her unwritten poems. <words>30</words>
She lifted it, felt its weight adjust to her palms, and drank—not to possess, but to empty. <words>19</words>
Ink poured out, forming words that crawled across the floor like centipedes, rearranging themselves into a stanza she had never dared to write: “Fate expects curtains, but I burn the theater.” <words>32</words>
The witch’s footsteps echoed, returning early. <words>7</words>
Lira set the Cup down; it refilled with silence. <words>9</words>
She stepped back into the corridor, blanket slung over her shoulder, the new stanza scorched into her forearm like a promise. <words>23</words>
By morning the witch would find every cage open, every familiar gone, following verses that led beyond the menagerie’s walls. <words>23</words>
Lira walked out humming, already rehearsing the encore fate never saw coming. <words>15</words>
