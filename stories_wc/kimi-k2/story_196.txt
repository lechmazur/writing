The tired swordsman leaned against the vending machine in the quiet breakroom, watching Brother Kael's resignation letter flutter on the corkboard like a dying moth. <words>25</words>
He clutched the plain cloth bag tighter, feeling the weight of his hidden promise pressing against his palm—a promise made to himself when he'd first arrived at the floating rock monastery, before the weight of apathy had settled into his bones. <words>45</words>
"Another one bites the dust," he muttered with fiercely apathetic precision, though his fingers betrayed him by tracing the bag's worn seams where he'd once stitched a map of meteor showers. <words>33</words>
The monastery drifted above the clouds, its ancient stones humming with the same indifference that had crept into his heart during five years of meditation and sword practice that felt increasingly hollow. <words>32</words>
He'd come here to overcome the violence that had carved scars across his soul, but instead he'd found only the comfortable numbness of routine, the spark of defiance that once drove him now buried under layers of practiced detachment. <words>38</words>
Brother Kael had been the last person who still looked at the night sky with wonder, who'd whispered about following meteor showers across the void between floating rocks, who'd understood that some promises couldn't be spoken aloud. <words>38</words>
The swordsman pulled out the bag's contents: a child's drawing of meteors, a small telescope lens, and a note in his own handwriting from years ago—"When the last believer leaves, follow the falling stars home." <words>38</words>
He felt the knowing naivety of recognizing his own foolishness while simultaneously understanding that this foolishness was the only thing that made him human. <words>27</words>
The quiet breakroom suddenly felt vast, the space where Kael's presence had been now aching like a missing tooth, and the swordsman realized his apathy had been armor against exactly this kind of loss. <words>35</words>
He'd promised himself that when the monastery's last dreamer departed, he would leave too—not to return to violence, but to follow the meteor showers that Kael had mapped across the sky, to find whatever burned in their wake. <words>40</words>
The spark of defiance flickered in his chest—not against enemies or fate, but against his own fierce apathy, against the comfortable death-in-life he'd cultivated among the floating rocks. <words>33</words>
He folded the child's drawing carefully, placed the lens back in the plain cloth bag, and walked toward the monastery's edge where the meteor showers would begin their dance at twilight. <words>35</words>
Behind him, the vending machine hummed its mechanical indifference, but ahead lay the vast sky and the promise he'd hidden even from himself—that some forms of surrender were actually victories, that following falling stars was perhaps the most honest prayer a tired swordsman could offer. <words>48</words>
As he stepped off the floating rock, the knowing naivety of his choice wrapped around him like armor, and for the first time in years, he felt the weight of his sword as possibility rather than burden. <words>38</words>
