Inside the spongy, violet-lit ribcage of the giant mushroom house, the edgy tradesman—ink under every nail, goggles cracked like old ice—studied the torn corner of a flyer that once promised “Eternal Comfort.”<words>37</words>
The scrap’s jagged edge reminded him how memory distorts, stretching yesterday’s certainties into tomorrow’s bruises.<words>48</words>
He comfortingly pessimistic muttered, “Nothing lasts, not even forgetting,” while the final rotation of the forgotten windmill outside groaned through the stem walls like a dying whale.<words>66</words>
That groan synchronized with the tick of two battered pocket watches—his and the absent apprentice’s—hung from a shelf of bracket fungi, their second hands vectorizing time into neat, luminous lines across the damp air.<words>87</words>
Each green line mapped a corridor of the past, but the corridors bent, twisted, folded, proving again the distortion of memory, until the room itself seemed to breathe in sepia.<words>108</words>
He needed to carry a flickering candle through an endless void that yawned beneath the floor gills, a void the color of burnt photographs.<words>128</words>
Yet the candle’s flame kept guttering, as if reluctant to illuminate what had already been lost twice.<words>147</words>
He adjusted the watches, aligning their ticks to a perfect zero, and the vectorized paths sharpened, forming a narrow bridge of light over the dark.<words>168</words>
Stepping onto it, he felt the mushroom house sway, its blurry vividness smearing spore-dust into halos around every motion.<words>187</words>
Halfway across, the torn flyer corner fluttered from his pocket, caught an updraft, and unfolded into the full sheet it once was—only now the printed words oozed like wet paint, rearranging into a message he had never seen: “Return to the hinge of the first lie.”<words>225</words>
The windmill’s final rotation ended; the silence that followed was so complete it rang.<words>242</words>
In that ringing, memory snapped back, cruel and clear: the apprentice hadn’t left; she had been erased by the tradesman’s own wish to forget a botched repair that killed three miners.<words>275</words>
The candle flared, suddenly fierce, showing the void below was not endless but merely filled with the discarded faces of everyone he had edited out of his past.<words>304</words>
He could retreat, snuff the light, let the distortion of memory resume its merciful blur.<words>325</words>
Instead, comfortingly pessimistic to the last, he whispered, “Might as well burn the rest,” and stepped off the bridge.<words>348</words>
The synchronized watches stuttered, their vectorized lines collapsing into a single bright thread that lashed around his wrist like a lifeline.<words>373</words>
He descended, candle first, into the roar of forgotten names, determined to carry the flickering truth until either the flame or his courage expired.<words>400</words>
Behind him, the giant mushroom house sealed its pores, preserving the blurry vividness of a man who finally chose to remember.<words>425</words>
Above, the windmill’s vanes began a new rotation, powered not by wind but by the slow exhalation of a memory returning home.<words>450</words>
