The tense bodyguard, Kael, stood sentinel inside the lunar greenhouse perched on the crater’s edge, his shoulders locked as if bracing against an invisible commander. <words>25</words>
Amid park visits scheduled by the Consortium to showcase their Eden, he clutched a faded photograph of a girl who once grew tomatoes on Earth soil, her smile sunlit and unowned. <words>38</words>
Every visitor’s murmur drifted like oxygen through the vents, and Kael began collecting fragments of overheard stories—an old woman recalling rebellion, a child whispering about seeds that refused patents. <words>54</words>
Serendipitously stubborn, he pocketed each tale the way others pocketed souvenir moon-dust, letting them scratch against the photograph until the paper felt alive. <words>69</words>
The greenhouse’s serene anger hummed in the leaves: plants forced into lunar rhythms, roots still aching for Earth’s pulse, a quiet fury he recognized in his own heartbeat. <words>85</words>
Night after night, while the crater’s shadow lengthened like a leash, Kael replayed the stories, arranging them into a mosaic of forbidden futures. <words>99</words>
He learned of a hidden launch window, of pilots who bartered hope for silence, of a code phrase—“timely rebirth”—that could ratify escape from the Consortium’s orbit. <words>115</words>
The photograph’s edges frayed further, yet the girl’s eyes grew sharper, urging him to break free from the controlling influence that had once drafted him as a shield for tyrants. <words>131</words>
On the final park visit, tourists floated along the hydroponic aisles, praising the engineered lilies while Kael’s collected stories burned like phosphorus in his chest. <words>147</words>
When the guide recited the Consortium’s anthem, Kael stepped forward, voice calm, rage steady, and spoke the code phrase into the public comm, knowing surveillance would hear. <words>164</words>
Alarms hesitated; the system searched for context among the fragments he had seeded, found them coherent, and—serendipitously stubborn logic—granted the ratification he demanded. <words>181</words>
Doors to the service dock slid open, revealing a courier shuttle prepped by strangers who had once whispered stories within his hearing. <words>196</words>
Kael pressed the faded photograph to the greenhouse glass, a silent promise that the girl’s tomatoes would root again in free soil. <words>211</words>
He stepped across the threshold, the lunar dawn igniting the crater’s rim like a blade of light, and felt the timely rebirth begin—not in a burst, but in the slow unfurling of his unclenched fists. <words>230</words>
Behind him, the greenhouse exhaled serene anger into the vacuum, leaves trembling as if waving goodbye to their reluctant guardian turned seed-smuggler. <words>247</words>
The shuttle lifted, carrying Kael and the stories he had gathered, each fragment now a living star chart guiding them toward an Earth no longer controlled. <words>264</words>
As the moon shrank in the viewport, Kael finally smiled, the same curve the girl wore in the photograph, and he whispered, “We are the timely rebirth,” letting the words ratify their new orbit. <words>283</words>
