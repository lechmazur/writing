The solemn orchardist knelt between rows of dwarf cherry trees grafted with neon veins, their fruit glowing like soft alarms against the night smog of the cyberpunk city rooftop garden. <words>31</words>
In the hush between two heartbeats, he felt the plain key press against his palm, a dull brass reminder of the greenhouse door he had locked at sunset. <words>25</words>
Below, the skyline flickered with advertisements for synaptic vacations, yet up here the only pulse came from the drip-irrigation lines pulsing faintly, like capillaries trying to remember blood. <words>25</words>
He had come to this altitude to escape the overlooked child he once was, the boy who spoke to sprinkler heads because no one else listened, whose questions were always x-out by hurried adults. <words>30</words>
Tonight, though, the garden itself seemed to speak in the excited restraint of rustling leaves, urging him to look again at the lives he had tried to disconnect from. <words>25</words>
A small drone buzzed overhead, endearingly irritating, its propellers humming the same off-key lullaby his mother used to sing before the data storms took her voice. <words>24</words>
The orchardist reached up, letting the drone land on his wrist; its camera eye projected a hologram of a girl watering seedlings on a distant balcony, her silhouette framed by the same moon. <words>28</words>
Recognition struck him: she was the overlooked child now, mirroring his past, and the realization traveled via interconnected lives like current through wet soil. <words>22</words>
He pressed the plain key into the drone’s cargo slot, programming it to drop the key at her feet with a note that read, “This opens more than doors; it opens company.” <words>28</words>
As the drone lifted, he whispered coordinates to the cherry trees, and their bioluminescent branches rearranged themselves into an arrow pointing her rooftop toward his. <words>24</words>
The hush deepened, yet his heart beat twice in the space of one, the second beat carrying the echo of her approaching footsteps along the fire-escape lattice. <words>24</words>
She arrived breathless, the key warm in her fist, her eyes wide with the same mix of wonder and caution he once wore like a second skin. <words>23</words>
Together they knelt, grafting a cutting from her balcony basil into his cherry rootstock, the splice glowing brighter as their stories intertwined. <words>22</words>
In that graft, the overlooked child was no longer a wound but a bridge, and the orchardist felt the city’s disconnection fracture just enough for one new connection to root. <words>27</words>
When the advertisements below rebooted into dawn, the garden remained lit by fruit and friendship, and the solemn orchardist smiled for the first time since the sky was analog. <words>27</words>
