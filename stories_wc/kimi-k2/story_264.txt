The unruly alchemist, Lysander Quell, haunted the abandoned shooting star tracking station with a magnifying glass whose cracked lens split every meteor into twin ghosts. <words>25</words>
Between innings of the minor-league game crackling on his pocket radio, he adjusted the outdated overhead projector so its hum rose like a cautious lullaby through the domed chamber. <words>37</words>
He believed the touched sky leaked wonder the way old pipes drip, and tonight he meant to disarm his own cynicism by bottling that drip before the seventh-inning stretch. <words>51</words>
The hauntingly cheerful melody of the projector mingled with distant organ chords, turning the concrete room into a cautious cathedral where falling stars were reluctant parishioners. <words>64</words>
Lysander clipped the cracked magnifying glass to the projector lens, letting the fracture double each streak of light into symmetrical omens on the curved ceiling. <words>77</words>
He whispered equations that sounded like playground rhymes, calculating angles with infinite caution so no trajectory would bruise the fragile sky he meant to impress. <words>90</words>
A meteor scratched the dome, and the projector’s hum deepened, vibrating the alchemist’s ribs until his heart matched the cautionary tempo. <words>102</words>
Between innings, the radio announcer’s voice cracked with statistics; Lysander countered by sketching star-paths in luminous chalk that glowed only under the fractured beam. <words>115</words>
Each chalk line was a dare to the cynic he had been that morning, a playful wager that wonder could still outweigh weariness. <words>127</words>
The cracked lens slipped, splitting a bright Perseid into four pale daughters that scattered across the ceiling like giggling secrets. <words>139</words>
Lysander laughed, the sound both haunted and cheerful, as if joy itself were a ghost learning to whistle. <words>150</words>
He adjusted the projector again, its hum now a cautious invitation for the sky to lean closer. <words>161</words>
Between innings, the station lights flickered; he took the blackout as applause and bowed to the constellations he had renamed after childhood pets. <words>174</words>
With infinite caution, he poured powdered silver into the projector’s beam, letting the metal vaporize into a shimmering veil that caught the next meteor like a firefly in a jar. <words>188</words>
The veil pulsed, and for one suspended breath the touched sky pressed its face against the veil, close enough for Lysander to see his own wonder reflected in starlight. <words>202</words>
Cynicism, disarmed by the playful spectacle, loosened its grip and drifted out through the cracked dome like smoke from a magician’s sleeve. <words>215</words>
Between innings, the final out was called; the radio fell silent, but the projector kept humming, a lullaby now for the sky alone. <words>228</words>
Lysander capped his chalk, pocketed the cracked magnifying glass, and left the station doors open so the next wanderer might follow the hum and be cautiously, cheerfully, wonderfully undone. <words>244</words>
