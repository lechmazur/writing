In the abandoned laboratory where glass beakers still sweated forgotten acids, the morbid juggler entered, juggling three shrunken heads that grinned like they knew the joke. <words>29</words>
He moved between overturned centrifuges and cages of calcified mice, his laughter low, rehearsing the punchline he planned to deliver to the universe itself. <words>25</words>
On a rusted workbench lay a bent ruler, warped by heat and time, its inch marks twisted into spirals that mocked every straight tradition ever measured. <words>25</words>
He plucked it up, feeling the metal's ache, and understood it as kin—both of them instruments bent until their purpose became a private rebellion. <words>25</words>
With defiant compassion he whispered to the severed heads, “We’ll twist the ritual until it laughs with us,” and their stitched lips seemed to widen. <words>25</words>
From a cracked apothecary jar he released the scent of rare spices—myrrh, black cardamom, and ghost pepper—letting the cloud drift through the lab like a genie unsure whom to serve. <words>30</words>
The aroma pooled around a broken centrifuge, and via that scented path the juggler coaxed the machine’s spirit, a tremor of dormant electricity, to wake and witness. <words>27</words>
He clamped the bent ruler between the centrifuge’s jaws, turning the device into a makeshift lathe that spun the metal faster than regret. <words>24</words>
Sparks flew, sketching violet arcs across the dark, each flash a syllable of the cosmic joke he was editing. <words>21</words>
The shrunken heads orbited his hands, their hair streaming like comet tails, consistently strange satellites that kept perfect time with his defiant pulse. <words>25</words>
He rehearsed the new tradition: instead of measuring life, the ruler would now bend reality, shortening sorrow, lengthening wonder, until grief itself became a prop. <words>27</words>
Within the span of a shared smile—his and the heads’ stitched rictus—the centrifuge screamed, the ruler snapped straight, then coiled again into a perfect Möbius strip. <words>29</words>
He caught the strip, now warm as a heartbeat, and threaded it through the eye sockets of the middle head, knotting memory into infinity. <words>24</words>
The laboratory lights flickered once, a standing ovation from ghosts of failed experiments who understood revision better than success. <words>22</words>
He bowed, juggling the Möbius ruler and the heads, their laughter harmonizing into one rolling note that climbed the cracked ceiling and escaped into the night. <words>27</words>
Outside, stars rearranged themselves into the shape of a grin, and the juggler knew the cosmos had finally heard the setup. <words>23</words>
He waited, still spinning his strange constellation of bones and metal, determined to laugh last when the universe delivered its inevitable rimshot. <words>25</words>
