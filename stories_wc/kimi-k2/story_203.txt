<story>
The exorcist with stage fright floated inside the orbital debris field, clutching a book of pressed wildflowers that had never belonged to her. <words>25</words>
She had inherited the lies pressed between each brittle petal, lies her grandmother swore would quiet any ghost, yet every ceremony left her voice trapped behind a locked throat. <words>42</words>
Amid toy assembly—tiny solar drones she built to keep her hands busy—she heard the defiant hush of the vacuum outside, a silence that mocked her fear of speaking. <words>59</words>
The station’s lights flickered; a spirit drifted through the hull, trailing memories of a war that had shattered this ring of metal into what the charts called “never usual.” <words>78</words>
It wore the face of her grandmother, the same woman who taught her that inheritance of lies was the only inheritance left after Earth died. <words>95</words>
The ghost pointed to the wildflowers, petals trembling like stage curtains she could never open. <words>108</words>
She understood: to banish it, she must submerge the book in liquid starlight collected in the coolant bay, but the bay door opened only by the sound of a key turning in a lock she had swallowed years ago during her first failed exorcism. <words>136</words>
Her motivation rose—not to erase the ghost, but to sculpt possibility from the ashes of “never,” to prove that fear could be forged into a voice. <words>156</words>
She took a half-built toy drone, soldered the last wire amid the drifting plastic limbs, and programmed it to hum the exact metallic note of that lost key. <words>177</words>
The drone spun, singing against the hull; the lock inside her ribcage vibrated, and the bay door sighed open like an audience leaning forward. <words>197</words>
Starlight pooled, silver and thick; she stepped into it, boots magnetized to the floor, and lowered the book until the pressed wildflowers began to drink the light. <words>220</words>
Petals unfolded, revealing not flowers but words—confessions her grandmother had hidden, each one a lie that kept the war alive. <words>240</words>
The ghost grew brighter, not weaker, feeding on the truth it had been denied. <words>253</words>
The exorcist felt the stage fright peel away like paint in vacuum; she spoke, voice steady, reading the lies aloud, turning them into a script the ghost could finally leave behind. <words>279</words>
With every sentence, the debris outside rearranged itself, shards clicking together into the shape of a single, vast toy: a cradle for whatever world might come next. <words>304</words>
The ghost bowed, dissolving into the cradle’s frame, gifting her the silence she no longer feared. <words>320</words>
She sealed the bay, the drone still humming the key’s note, a lullaby for the unborn. <words>336</words>
In the defiant hush that followed, she pressed new wildflowers between fresh pages—truth this time, fragile but alive—knowing inheritance could be rewritten, and that “never” was only another word for beginning. <words>368</words>
She clipped the book to her belt, turned toward the viewport, and began assembling another toy, possibility glinting in every shard of orbital light. <words>395</words>
