The uptight scribe, parchment tucked beneath his arm like a shield, climbed the witch's greenhouse clinging to a hill of gravestones, each step crunching against forgotten names. <words>31</words>
Inside, glass panes sweated with condensation, and vines strangled rusted trellises while the prototype light bulb from Tesla’s workshop flickered on a workbench, its filament humming a lullaby to the dead outside. <words>42</words>
He had come for the envelope sealed with black wax, the one rumored to hold instructions for empathy itself, yet now it lay torn open, its message stolen, leaving only a ghost of adhesive. <words>34</words>
By analyzing the leftover adhesive from the once-sealed envelope, he scraped a fleck onto a slide, held it to the bulb’s uncertain glow, and watched the residue bloom into microscopic runes that spelled regret. <words>36</words>
The witch, long vanished, had cultivated this place to teach hearts to soften; the scribe, armor-plated in rules, had arrived to catalogue her heresy, not to inherit it. <words>30</words>
Still, the quiet transformation began as the bulb brightened, its light threading through the greenhouse like warm wire, loosening the screws of his certainty. <words>27</words>
He felt the buried optimism stir, a seed beneath iron, when the runes rearranged themselves into the shape of a child’s open hand. <words>24</words>
In the moment when a puzzle piece finally fits, the scribe’s knees buckled; the hand became his own, once small, once reaching for a mother who never looked up from her ledgers. <words>32</words>
Tears threatened, but he clenched them back, recalling his oath: to cradle empathy in arms of steel, never to let it drip onto the page where it might smudge the ink of justice. <words>35</words>
The bulb pulsed, certainly uncertain, as if asking whether steel could be a cradle at all. <words>18</words>
He lifted the bulb, cradling it like an egg, and the greenhouse sighed; vines relaxed, gravestones leaned closer, listening. <words>22</words>
A wind rattled the panes, and from the hill below, the dead whispered, “Bellow, scribe, let the sound carry what words cannot.” <words>25</words>
He opened his mouth, and instead of the expected roar, a soft note escaped, a lullaby his mother had hummed while balancing books, never him. <words>30</words>
The adhesive dissolved into light, sealing the envelope anew, this time addressed to whoever next needed forgiving. <words>21</words>
The scribe stepped outside; dawn painted the gravestones gold, and the greenhouse dimmed behind him, its lesson complete. <words>22</words>
He walked down the hill, arms no longer steel but something stronger, carrying the prototype bulb like a heart learning to beat. <words>25</words>
