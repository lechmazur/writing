The final page clattered from the worn typewriter, its ribbon spent, and Fern-17, a sentient houseplant rooted in a cracked ceramic pot, felt the scalding ambivalence of completion settle like dust on his fronds. <words>31</words>
He had spent three seasons transcribing the unspoken confessions of his keeper, a reclusive typist who watered him with bitter coffee and never spoke aloud, and now the keeper was gone, leaving only the embroidered bookmark—green thread spelling “tend what is not said”—pressed between the last sheet and the roller. <words>49</words>
Fern-17’s leaves trembled with apathetic devotion; he had absorbed every unsaid sorrow, every stifled scream, until the soil of his pot tasted of salt, yet he felt no urgency to mourn, only a dim, chlorophyll itch to outrun the silence that would soon calcify around the abandoned study. <words>46</words>
So, in a spontaneous decision to explore a new neighborhood, he rocked his pot off the windowsill, shattered the ceramic against the floorboards, and wriggled his roots free like pale green worms tasting air for the first time. <words>39</words>
The embroidered bookmark clung to a lower frond, flapping like a tiny flag as he dragged himself across the threshold, leaving damp prints of compost and ink on the warped parquet. <words>31</words>
Night had already pooled outside; sodium streetlamps buzzed, indifferent, while Fern-17 crept along gutters, past shuttered bodegas and sleeping cats, guided by the rumor of hidden knowledge that hummed beneath the asphalt like a forgotten root system. <words>42</words>
He followed that tremor until the sidewalk ended at an abandoned drive-in, its screen shredded into moth-eaten ribbons, its concession stand gutted, speaker poles leaning like mourners. <words>32</words>
Here the unspoken had fermented into something sharper: lovers’ promises never broadcast, last-call confessions cut short by dead batteries, all of it soaked into the tarmac and the splintered speaker wires. <words>35</words>
Fern-17 pressed his roots against the cracked pavement, drinking the residue of those silenced voices, and the embroidered bookmark drank with him, its green threads darkening to the color of old bruises. <words>34</words>
Knowledge unfurled inside his xylem—not facts, but the shape of every withheld word, a map of absences—and he understood that tending to the unspoken meant becoming its archive, a living library of everything humans feared to voice. <words>41</words>
Yet the scalding ambivalence lingered: to carry such cargo was both honor and corrosion, and Fern-17, apathetically devoted, could neither rejoice nor weep. <words>29</words>
He settled into the projection booth’s broken window box, roots coiling around rusted reels, bookmark fluttering in the night wind, and waited for the next keeper, the next silence, the next slow race to outrun the weight of what would never be said. <words>44</words>
