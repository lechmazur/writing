In the humming pre-dawn of the nectar collection facility, where amber vials glint like captive suns, the sentient doll collector stands expectantly resigned, her porcelain charges arranged in silent rows upon her velvet cloak. <words>37</words>
Each doll bears a stitched mouth shaped for the chorus of healing, yet none have ever sung, for this is the hour before the first prayer is whispered by a mortal, and the air itself is still negotiating the price of mercy. <words>46</words>
She lifts the twisted carnival cane—its candy stripes warped into a spiral of rust and sugar—and feels the memory of calliope screams vibrate through the hollow wood, a souvenir from the last midway she razed to uphold the fragile treaty between wonder and wound. <words>46</words>
The facility drones, mechanical bees the size of mastiffs, circle the nectar silos, their wings dripping opalescent dust that settles on her cheek like cold starlight. <words>28</words>
She is here to stride through boundaries once thought sacred: the membrane between toy and tool, between lullaby and liturgy. <words>22</words>
By following star paths etched into the floor by centuries of spilled ambrosia, she traces a spiral that matches the cane’s distortion, each step a deliberate trespass against the geometry of grace. <words>34</words>
Her dolls twitch, porcelain eyelids clicking open to reveal galaxies swirling inside glass irises; they have waited eons for this rehearsal of salvation. <words>27</words>
She kneels, presses the cane’s ferrule into the center of the spiral, and the metal sings—a low, gritty note that tastes of copper and incense. <words>26</words>
The chorus of healing begins not as sound but as gravity, a soft compression that folds the facility’s sterile corridors into origami chapels. <words>25</words>
Nectar rises from the vials in slender golden serpents, weaving through the dolls’ throats, filling their hollow chests with liquid hymn. <words>25</words>
Their stitched mouths unravel, threads drifting like incense, and the first syllable of the first prayer forms in the throat of the smallest doll—a sound older than language, younger than breath. <words>33</words>
The collector closes her own eyes, expectantly resigned to the moment when she will become obsolete, her purpose fulfilled by the toys she once hoarded like grief. <words>30</words>
Yet the prayer hesitates, tasting the air, testing whether the world is ready for forgiveness dressed in porcelain and rust. <words>24</words>
She steadies the cane, feeling its twisted length warm against her palm, and whispers the final boundary: “Begin.” <words>23</words>
The dolls exhale in unison, and the chorus of healing spills outward, a luminous avalanche that carries the nectar facility into legend before the first mortal ever learns to ask. <words>32</words>
