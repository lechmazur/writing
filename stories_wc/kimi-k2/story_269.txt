The nostalgic tailor stood alone on the steampunk observation deck, brass gears grinding beneath his feet as the final code dissolved into meaningless static. <words>25</words>
Before him, the dusty mirror—once a prop in his cramped shop—now stretched floor to ceiling, its surface rippling like oil under lightning. <words>42</words>
He had sewn uniforms for revolutionaries and wedding gowns for ghosts, but tonight he would stitch a path through parallel lives. <words>58</words>
Thunder rolled across the iron sky, and the mirror answered with subtly menacing whispers: every reflection showed him dying differently. <words>77</words>
In one pane he burned; in another he drowned; in a third he simply forgot how to breathe. <words>93</words>
Yet each death wore the same expression—hopeful desperation, the same hunger that now clawed at his ribs. <words>110</words>
He pressed his calloused palms to the glass and began the improbable confessions storms always demanded. <words>127</words>
"I once hemmed a dress for a woman who never existed," he murmured, voice shaking like the rigging above. <words>144</words>
"I embroidered lies into every pocket, telling men their hearts were safe when I knew the seams would split." <words>163</words>
The mirror brightened, threads of light weaving between his words. <words>175</words>
"I am terrified of finishing anything, because completion means I must become what I made." <words>193</words>
Lightning struck the deck's copper rail; the air tasted of ozone and regret. <words>207</words>
The tailor stepped closer, reassure himself aloud: "If I can confess the unforgivable, I can transcend the forgivable." <words>226</words>
His reflection multiplied—tailor upon tailor, each carrying scissors that glinted like guillotines. <words>243</words>
They spoke in chorus, voices braided with steam: "To ascend beyond mortal limits, you must sew yourself into the storm itself." <words>264</words>
He pulled silver thread from his pocket, the same spool he'd carried since his first commission. <words>281</words>
With trembling fingers he stitched lightning to shadow, binding his reflection to the glass until the mirror began to melt. <words>300</words>
The deck lurched; gears screamed as reality thinned. <words>311</words>
"I choose the life where I never stop becoming," he declared, stepping through the liquid silver. <words>329</words>
Behind him, the observation deck crumbled into clockwork dust. <words>342</words>
Ahead, infinite versions of himself reached out, each offering a different needle, a different sky. <words>359</words>
He took none; instead he unraveled his own sleeve, letting the thread spiral into the void between worlds. <words>377</words>
The storm swallowed his final confession: "I was always the garment, never the tailor." <words>394</words>
As the last stitch dissolved, he became the seam between lives, the echo that reassures every frightened reflection: transformation is only impossible until it isn't. <words>420</words>
