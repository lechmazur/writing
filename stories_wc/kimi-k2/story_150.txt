<story>
The outlaw cowboy poet known only as Calder drifted into the steampunk observatory dome at dusk, boots ticking against brass grating like a metronome for the rehearsals of the celestial opera. <words>31</words>
He carried the worn runic bone dice in a leather pouch against his heart, feeling their virtually peculiar warmth pulse with every breath of steam from the pipe organs below. <words>28</words>
Tonight the dome's walls were rehearsing too, shifting text across copper panels that misaligned every stanza of the libretto into riddles only he could read. <words>25</words>
Calder believed the dice and the walls shared intertwined destinies, that each roll would reveal which version of the future the dome intended to perform. <words>25</words>
He ordered a bitter espresso from the skeletal automaton barista and sat beneath the great clockwork telescope, reading coffee shop walls that keep changing text faster than his outlaw heart could parse. <words>31</words>
The words rearranged themselves into a prophecy: "The poet who gambles with stars must lose his name to find the verse that moves worlds." <words>23</words>
Saturated ambivalence thickened the air like coal smoke; he wanted both anonymity and immortality, both escape and belonging. <words>19</words>
During the overture's first rehearsal, brass gears sang and steam valves hissed, yet Calder heard only the dice whispering in archaic tongues. <words>22</words>
He spilled the bones across the marble table; they landed showing symbols that matched exactly the newest misaligned text sliding across the wall behind him. <words>26</words>
The coincidence was too precise to be chance, too intimate to be mere machinery; intertwined destinies tightened like lasso around his throat. <words>23</words>
Calder understood then that the dome itself was rehearsing his life, testing variations of his choices before committing to the final performance. <words>24</words>
To spark unstoppable curiosity in the audience of stars above, he would have to wager the last thing he owned: the story of how he became an outlaw. <words>27</words>
He pressed the dice against the wall; copper heated, runes flared, and the text stabilized into a single line: "Begin." <words>20</words>
Throughout rehearsals, Calder recited verses that were half confession, half incantation, each line causing constellations to twitch as if adjusting their own scripts. <words>26</words>
The automaton audience clanked approval, yet their applause felt like shackles; saturated ambivalence returned, heavier now with knowledge. <words>20</words>
When opening night arrived, the dome darkened to velvet black, and Calder rolled the dice one final time. <words>18</words>
They cracked, releasing silver dust that spelled his true name across the inner shell of the universe before dissolving into starlight. <words>22</words>
The outlaw vanished, but every night the dome repeats his poem, and somewhere a child hears it and feels curiosity ignite like a furnace. <words>25</words>
