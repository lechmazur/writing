In the soundless sanctuary of the abandoned opera house, dutiful ward Lira waited for the next audition, her worn leather glove flexing like a second skin against the chill of marble balustrades. <words>31</words>
She had been raised here, dusting velvet seats for ghosts, and the place had taught her to be eagerly jaded—laughing at every hopeful warble before it cracked. <words>45</words>
Yet tonight she stalked the wings with a new purpose: to solve the riddle of her own approaching death, announced by a doctor’s whisper she refused to obey. <words>59</words>
Between acts she lifted stolen phones from coat pockets, thumbing them alive to record cryptic voice notes that she then slid back like hot coins. <words>74</words>
Each note began with the same line—“Listen, the aria you fear is already over”—and ended with coordinates to the next audition chair, reframing the familiar rows into a map of final moments. <words>90</words>
Contestants arrived, sang, were dismissed; none noticed the graceless beauty of a girl who applauded without sound, timing their heartbeats against her own faltering rhythm. <words>105</words>
During the mezzo’s screech, Lira pressed play on the latest stolen phone; her own voice, disguised and doubled, echoed back: “Mortality is a cracked mirror—laugh before it cuts.” <words>121</words>
She obeyed herself, a fearless laugh spilling out so sharply that the mezzo faltered, the judges flinched, and the sanctuary’s dust rose like applause. <words>135</words>
The glove’s creases held decades of wax and rosin; she rubbed them now, feeling every stagehand burn, every prima’s tantrum, every echo she had swallowed to remain dutiful. <words>150</words>
Another phone, another note: “Find the seat that never warms; there the trapdoor sighs.” <words>160</words>
She counted chairs, subtracted breaths, and arrived at seat J47, its velvet cold as a confession. <words>172</words>
Beneath it lay a service hatch she had swept past a thousand times; tonight she pried it open, revealing a ladder descending into the orchestra pit’s black lung. <words>187</words>
The final audition began above—an unaccompanied tenor scaling toward a high C that would never land. <words>199</words>
Lira dropped the last stolen phone into the pit; its screen lit the void like a votive, playing her concluding message: “When the note breaks, follow the echo; it knows the way out.” <words>216</words>
The tenor cracked, the sanctuary swallowed the sound, and she laughed again, louder, graceless, beautiful. <words>228</words>
She climbed down, glove squealing against rungs, each step reframing the familiar opera house into a cradle instead of a tomb. <words>242</words>
At the bottom she found no darkness, only the hush of velvet curtains stored like sleeping giants, and she lay among them, waiting for the last beat to pass. <words>257</words>
Above, judges shuffled papers, mortals pretending permanence; below, Lira smiled, offering mortality her final, fearless laugh, the soundless sanctuary keeping the secret like a loyal conspirator. <words>275</words>
