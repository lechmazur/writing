<story>
In the sandstone labyrinth where floating lanterns bob like slow thoughts, the homeless philosopher-king crouches, earnestly frivolous, clutching a weather-beaten kaleidoscope. <words>25</words>
He once ruled an invisible city of ideas, but a transformative betrayal—his own council selling maps of his mind—left him crownless, seeking the one corridor still uncharted. <words>42</words>
During readings of ancient vows, he slips into random weddings, pockets full of confetti-coded proposals, each scrap a theorem of escape. <words>58</words>
Tonight, the lanterns spell “READ” in wavering fire, and he extends a handful of turquoise paper to a bewildered bride, whispering, “Marry the maze instead.” <words>78</words>
She laughs, thinking it part of the revelry, and the confetti flutters into the air, rearranging itself into a shifting keyhole that only the kaleidoscope can decode. <words>98</words>
He peers through the scratched lens; fractured sandstone corridors tessellate into a single straight path, yet the image dissolves if doubt enters his eye. <words>118</words>
The betrayal replays: his vizier trading secrets for silk, the council sealing the final gate with his own axioms; rage would cloud the lens, so he chooses wonder instead. <words>140</words>
Another wedding erupts nearby; he offers the groom a rose-petal cipher, earnestly frivolous again, and the petals spiral into a staircase of light descending into the labyrinth’s heart. <words>165</words>
Each ceremony is a stanza, each confetti scrap a syllable in the poem he is writing to outwit the walls. <words>183</words>
At the seventh wedding, an old librarian recognizes the glint of the kaleidoscope and murmurs, “The maze reads you back; solve it by letting it solve you.” <words>208</words>
He nods, understanding that complex simplicity demands surrender, not conquest. <words>225</words>
He scatters the last of the confetti—silver stars that spell “FORGIVE”—and the sandstone shifts, revealing a door of air. <words>247</words>
Behind it lies the council chamber where his betrayers wait, now statues of salt, their faces frozen in the moment of treachery. <words>270</words>
He lifts the kaleidoscope; the statues fracture into harmless shards of colored glass, and the labyrinth exhales, its puzzle complete. <words>293</words>
Yet he hesitates, for the path beyond the door leads out of the labyrinth entirely, into a plain where no lanterns float and no weddings disturb the silence. <words>320</words>
He turns back, earnestly frivolous to the end, and begins scattering new confetti—this time blank—inviting future wanderers to write their own proposals. <words>350</words>
The kaleidoscope warms in his palm, its mirrors now reflecting not corridors but faces: every bride, every groom, every reader who ever believed a maze could be loved open. <words>385</words>
He settles cross-legged beneath a lantern, homeless no longer, king of questions rather than answers, and listens to the sandstone whisper, “The labyrinth was never unsolvable; it was waiting for someone willing to betray certainty itself.” <words>430</words>
