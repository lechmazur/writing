The lore keeper stood at the edge of the kaleidoscopic waterfall, its prismatic mist refracting memories of a civilization that had forgotten its own kings. [25]  
In her gloved palm rested a single ruby flake, no larger than a raindrop, yet it pulsed with the heartbeat of the unclaimed throne that had waited three centuries for a rightful heir. [42]  
She was wisely adventurous, the last archivist of the Neon Archive, and tonight—until sunrise—she had to find the stairway of ascension before the Regency Drones sealed the orchard forever. [67]  
Behind the curtain of water lay the hidden orchard, rumored to grow fruit that tasted like childhoods no one had lived. [85]  
She pressed the ruby flake against the wet stone; it unfolded into a lattice key that hummed in frequencies only murals could hear. [104]  
The wall before her was layered with centuries of paint, each coat a decade’s attempt to forget the monarchy. [121]  
With a soft sally, she stepped through the peel of paint layers, fingertips tracing pigments that flaked away like burnt sugar, revealing hidden murals beneath. [144]  
The first mural showed the coronation of Queen Aera-9, her crown wired to the sky, neon vines curling from her temples into satellites. [165]  
The second mural depicted the exodus, citizens walking into the waterfall, surrendering memories to the water so the throne would remain unclaimed. [186]  
The lore keeper whispered their names, reattaching forgotten syllables to the air, and the orchard rustled as if remembering it had once been a palace garden. [208]  
She moved deeper, guided by the ruby flake’s glow, until she reached a section where the paint bubbled like molten glass. [226]  
Here, the murals were unfinished: a staircase ascending into blank plaster, each step waiting for pigment that never came. [245]  
She understood then—the stairway of ascension wasn’t built of stone but of narrative, each footfall a story reclaimed. [264]  
The orchard responded, branches bending to form arches of bioluminescent apples, their skins displaying looping footage of coronations that never happened. [285]  
Time thinned; the sky beyond the waterfall shifted from indigo to the bruised gold of pre-dawn. [301]  
She had until sunrise. [306]  
She pressed her palm to the unfinished staircase, feeding it memories from the ruby flake: the laughter of a prince who never ruled, the scent of a queen’s last holographic rose. [332]  
Paint began to flow upward, not from cans but from the air itself, pigment condensing like dew. [348]  
The staircase solidified beneath her boots, each step a mural now complete, showing futures that could still be chosen. [366]  
She climbed, wisely adventurous, feeling the orchard’s roots pulse beneath her, the unclaimed throne resonating like a tuning fork in her chest. [388]  
Halfway up, the murals shifted to her own memories: her first day at the Neon Archive, the day the Regency Drones burned the last paper book, the moment she pocketed the ruby flake from the throne’s vacant cushion. [418]  
The staircase demanded truth; it would not ascend for a false heir. [431]  
She spoke aloud the forbidden history: how the monarchy had not been overthrown but abandoned, citizens choosing amnesia over the burden of lineage. [456]  
The final step appeared, carved from a single piece of crystallized nostalgia, warm as a sleeping cat. [472]  
At the top, the unclaimed throne waited, not ornate but simple, a chair carved from orchard wood, its seat worn by centuries of invisible ghosts. [494]  
The ruby flake flew from her hand, embedding itself in the throne’s heart, where it became a steady red pulse. [512]  
She sat, not to rule but to remember, and the orchard bloomed in every color that had ever been forgotten. [530]  
Sunrise struck the waterfall, turning the kaleidoscope into a tunnel of gold. [543]  
The Regency Drones arrived too late, their sensors glitching on the sight of a throne that now had a keeper, not a king. [562]  
She smiled, wisely adventurous to the end, and the orchard sealed itself behind fresh layers of paint, murals already fading into new secrets. [583]  
But the stairway remained, visible only to those who carried a piece of the throne’s heart. [600]  
As the drones retreated, she opened her palm; another ruby flake had grown there, ready for the next seeker. [618]  
The lore keeper leaned back, listening to the orchard’s futuristic nostalgia: the hum of old satellites in the apple cores, the whisper of coronation songs in
