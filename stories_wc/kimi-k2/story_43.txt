The wary explorer stepped through the shattered rose window of the neon cathedral, its tubes still pulsing violet and gold long after the last human story was written. <words>25</words>
In the hush that followed the end of all narratives, she clutched the damaged music cd she had carried since the evacuation, its reflective skin spider-webbed with cracks like frozen lightning. <words>38</words>
She was loudly introverted, humming defiant chords beneath her breath while her boots whispered over broken pews, afraid the silence would swallow even that. <words>50</words>
The cathedral’s holographic saints flickered, glitching between benediction and blank static, emblems of courage that no longer knew whom to bless. <words>63</words>
She had come to meander, not to pray, tracing the flicker of fireflies under a thick fog that pressed against the stained glass like a held breath. <words>76</words>
Each insect carried a shard of neon scripture in its abdomen, spelling fragments of forgotten bravery across the nave. <words>87</words>
She knelt, letting the fog coil around her wrists, and set the cracked disc on the altar where candle wax once pooled. <words>99</words>
When the first firefly landed on the cd’s mirrored surface, the scratch refracted its glow into a crooked hope, a jagged path of light that pointed toward the crypt. <words>113</words>
Following that trembling constellation, she descended spiral stairs slick with condensation, her courage a half-remembered melody she could no longer name. <words>126</words>
In the crypt, rows of dormant story engines stood like organ pipes, their brass lungs waiting for a final chord. <words>138</words>
She pressed the damaged music cd into the central console; the cracks aligned with ancient grooves, and a single note—warped, fragile—escaped. <words>151</words>
The fireflies swarmed, weaving the tone into luminous sheet music that spelled her childhood nickname across the fog. <words>163</words>
At the sight, her throat unlocked a sound between laugh and sob, loud in the introverted vault, and the echo answered back in her own forgotten voice. <words>176</words>
The emblems of courage brightened: saints re-rendered, neon ribs knitting into wings above her. <words>187</words>
She understood then that reunion did not require perfection; the damaged disc, the crooked hope, the cracked self—all could still carry a tune. <words>201</words>
Guided by firefly notation, she climbed back into the nave, fog parting like curtains after the final encore. <words>213</words>
Outside the cathedral, the world was blank parchment, yet the music kept playing, skipping at the scratches but never stopping. <words>225</words>
She stepped onto the empty boulevard, humming along, her wary heart keeping tempo with the luminous insects that now orbited her like tiny moons. <words>238</words>
Wherever she would meander next, the song would travel too, a portable cathedral of crooked hope broadcasting courage into the unwritten night. <words>251</words>
