The brazen raider, Kael, slipped through the cracked dome of the forgotten underwater city laboratory, lungs burning with stolen breath and the weight of social upheaval above. <words>29</words>
He carried only a piece of charcoal tucked behind his ear, a relic from the hearth of the faltering genius he once betrayed. <words>22</words>
Dr. Lysandra Voss, the mind who once mapped neural stars, now hunched over dying consoles, her brilliance flickering like a candle in a storm. <words>22</words>
Kael moved impulsively thoughtful, each step a contradiction—boot heel silent, heart loud—through corridors where algae grew like mourning lace. <words>20</words>
He had come not to plunder, but to warn. <words>8</words>
The rebellion topside had turned; the council now hunted minds like hers, branding genius as treason. <words>17</words>
He found her in the echo chamber, where sound once shaped memory, now only betrayal lingered. <words>16</words>
“Lys,” he rasped, voice fractured by guilt and grace. <words>8</words>
She didn’t turn. <words>3</words>
Instead, she whispered, “You smell like smoke and salt. You’ve come to finish what you started.” <words>17</words>
Kael knelt, pulled the charcoal from behind his ear, and began to draw on the glass wall—symbols from their childhood, superstitions they once carved into tree bark to ward off storms. <words>32</words>
A spiral for protection. <words>4</words>
A broken star for betrayal. <words>5</words>
A flame inside a circle—for genius, for shelter. <words>9</words>
“I was a fool,” he said. <words>5</words>
“I believed the council when they said your mind was a weapon. I delivered you to them. I thought I was saving you.” <words>25</words>
She turned then, eyes hollow but not dead. <words>7</words>
“You saved me into a cage.” <words>5</words>
He pressed his palm to the drawing. <words>6</words>
“They’re coming. Submersibles. Torpedoes. They want your last notes. Your final spark.” <words>15</words>
“I won’t run.” <words>3</words>
“You don’t have to. Just hide the flame.” <words>7</words>
He reached into his coat, pulled out a vial of bioluminescent algae—her own design, once dismissed as whimsy. <words>18</words>
“Swallow it. Let it live in you. They’ll search the lab, not your blood.” <words>15</words>
She stared at the vial, then at the charcoal symbols. <words>9</words>
“You’re still the boy who believed in ghosts and guardian spirals.” <words>12</words>
“I never stopped.” <words>3</words>
She took the vial. <words>3</words>
Outside, the first torpedo struck the dome. <words>7</words>
Cracks bloomed like spiderwebs. <words>5</words>
Kael stood, drew his blade—not to fight, but to buy time. <words>11</words>
“Go,” he said. <words>2</words>
She hesitated. <words>2</words>
Then vanished into the maintenance shaft, the vial glowing faintly in her palm. <words>12</words>
Kael turned to face the breach, blade raised, heart steady. <words>10</words>
He whispered the old words, the ones they used to chant before sleep: “Spiral protect, star forgive, flame endure.” <words>18</words>
The water rushed in. <words>4</words>
But the flame, sheltered now in flesh and memory, would not go out. <words>13</words>
