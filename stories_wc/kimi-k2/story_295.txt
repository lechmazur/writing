In the witch's herb garden where moonflowers hissed and basil screamed, the jovial sellsword Kestrel twirled his blade like a baton, humming a drinking song while the stars above him rearranged themselves into a warning. <words>37</words>
He had come boldly reluctant, swaggering through the gate yet dragging his boots as though each step might snap the withering vow he carried—a promise to his long-dead mother that he would never again kill for coin. <words>46</words>
Tonight, however, the vow was wilting faster than the rosemary under the witch's curse, because the witch herself had offered him a treasure greater than gold: an astronomical telescope rumored to show the future to whoever focused it on the right constellation. <words>45</words>
Kestrel needed that glimpse; doubt had crept into his mind like bindweed, whispering that every cheerful quip was merely armor over a hollow heart, and he meant to dethrone that doubt once and for all. <words>38</words>
The witch, smelling of crushed sage and thunder, pointed her crooked finger toward a patch of screaming thyme and said the telescope lay buried beneath it, sealed inside a time capsule her own family had planted generations ago as a tradition of preserving hope. <words>44</words>
Throughout the transformation of the garden—petals blackening, vines writhing into runes—Kestrel dug, singing louder to drown the plants' shrieks, until his gauntlet struck iron and the elegant mayhem around him paused as though holding its breath. <words>39</words>
Inside the capsule, beside the brass telescope, lay a letter addressed to him in his mother's handwriting, ink still wet as if time itself had been peeled open. <words>30</words>
"To my laughing son," it read, "if you read this, you have already kept the vow by choosing to look forward instead of back; the telescope shows no future but the one you decide to aim at." <words>39</words>
Kestrel laughed then, a great booming laugh that scattered the cursed herbs into harmless green confetti, and he lifted the telescope like a trophy, sighting it not on any constellation but on his own reflection in a silvered leaf. <words>38</words>
The image wavered and steadied into a man still jovial, still sellsword, yet no longer for hire—instead he would wander, telling stories, planting time capsules of his own, each one a seed against doubt. <words>38</words>
The witch, satisfied, snapped her fingers; the garden returned to tranquil fragrance, and she vanished, leaving only the echo of her cackle and a single sprig of un-withered rosemary tucked behind Kestrel's ear like a promise kept. <words>39</words>
He strode out through the gate, telescope slung across his back, whistling the same drinking song but with new verses blooming like the herbs at his heels, and wherever he walked that night the stars above him rearranged themselves into applause. <words>42</words>
