<story>
Through the restless hush of midwinter, the nervous kingpin clutched his collection of dried seed pods like rosary beads against the xenophobic enclave's frozen breath. <words>25</words>
He had once ruled these streets with fragile ferocity, but tonight he was only a man taking a detour to visit a landmark seen on a sign that read "Communal Gardens—All Welcome." <words>37</words>
The sign was unlikely probable, a contradiction nailed crookedly to a fence that still bore the scorch marks of last year's purge. <words>48</words>
Inside the enclave, neighbors had learned to hold the line against the tyranny of indifference by pretending difference itself was contagious. <words>60</words>
Yet the pods in his pocket—moonflower, amaranth, and crimson clover—whispered that roots could still unsettle concrete if given darkness and time. <words>73</words>
He paused at the garden gate, hearing the hush thicken, as though the snow itself were listening. <words>83</words>
A single lantern swung above rows of turned earth, each mound labeled in a dozen languages, some scratched out and rewritten so often the wood looked bruised. <words>96</words>
The kingpin remembered when he ordered those languages erased; now their ghosts warmed him more than any fire. <words>107</words>
He knelt, loosening the pods with tremor-kissed fingers, and felt the old authority drain into the soil like meltwater. <words>118</words>
A child stepped from the shadows, cheeks raw with cold, eyes bright with inherited suspicion. <words>128</words>
"Those seeds won't grow here," the boy said, voice thin as frost. <words>136</words>
"They already have," the kingpin replied, placing a pod in the boy's palm, watching the small fist close around the impossible gift. <words>148</words>
Together they pressed the seeds into the midwinter ground, an act so quiet it roared. <words>157</words>
Somewhere beyond the fence, enclave patrols circled, but the restless hush held them back, as if even hatred needed a breath. <words>169</words>
The boy asked why a stranger would risk the curfew; the kingpin answered, "Because I was the stranger who forgot." <words>181</words>
He told of barricades built from fear, of gardens burned to keep purity pure, of the moment he realized indifference was the only tyranny that never slept. <words>195</words>
The boy listened, then fetched a jar of saved rainwater, and they watered the seeds with fragile ferocity, two conspirators against winter itself. <words>208</words>
Dawn would bring patrols, questions, perhaps another purge, but tonight the garden breathed with them. <words>219</words>
The kingpin left the rest of his pods beneath the lantern, a confession spelled in botanical Latin. <words>229</words>
Walking home, he took the long detour past the landmark sign, now luminous with frost, and felt the unlikely probable take root inside his chest. <words>242</words>
Behind him, the communal plot waited, a quiet mutiny sleeping under snow, ready to unsettle the enclave's heart come spring. <words>254</words>
He would return, not as kingpin but as gardener, to hold the line against forgetting. <words>265</words>
The restless hush carried his promise forward, midwinter's fragile ferocity turning toward thaw. <words>276</words>
