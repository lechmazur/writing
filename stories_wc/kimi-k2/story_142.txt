<story>
The broke aristocrat, Lysander, clutched the botanical illustration of a ghost orchid, its petals inked in blurry vividness, as he stepped through the rusted gates of the haunted amusement park roller coaster. <words>31</words>
Between parallel paths of moonlit track and shadowed ground, he decided to walk instead of drive, feeling the legacy's burden of unpaid debts and crumbling estates pressing against his silk-lined coat. <words>42</words>
The illustration, once part of his grandmother's herbarium, was realistically odd—its roots tangled around tiny skulls no botanist had ever catalogued—yet it hummed with the promise of secret recipes for liquors that could restore his family's fortune. <words>55</words>
He moved past the skeletal cars of the roller coaster, their seats torn open like mouths, harmonizing his breathing with the creaking metal to keep the spirits calm. <words>67</words>
A child's laughter echoed, warped by decades of abandonment, and Lysander paused, remembering how his grandmother had brewed absinthe from orchids that grew only where grief pooled. <words>82</words>
The path split again, one track leading upward into darkness, the other downward toward a faint green glow; he chose the latter, guided by the illustration's subtle shift in hue. <words>96</words>
Here, between worlds, time folded like paper, and he saw himself as a boy riding this same coaster, unaware that every ticket bought was a coin stolen from tomorrow. <words>110</words>
The orchid in the drawing began to bleed real sap, sweet and metallic, and he licked it cautiously, tasting the recipe: ghost orchid, regret, and a drop of noble blood. <words>124</words>
Spirits materialized—former riders trapped in loops of their final screams—and Lysander spoke gently, offering to harmonize their torment with the melody his grandmother sang while distilling. <words>139</words>
They led him to a hidden greenhouse beneath the coaster's foundation, where orchids grew through ribcages and bottles aged in coffins, their labels written in his grandmother's spidery hand. <words>154</words>
He worked through the night, following the illustration's margins that now moved like instructional film, distilling the liquor that would either save or damn his lineage. <words>168</words>
As dawn approached, the roller coaster's cars began to move, completing their final ride with phantom passengers, and Lysander bottled the last drop, feeling the legacy's burden shift from weight to wings. <words>184</words>
The spirits smiled, their faces clearing like morning fog, and they whispered that wealth was never the recipe's true gift—it was the choice to walk the parallel paths of ruin and redemption simultaneously. <words>199</words>
Lysander emerged from the park as the sun painted the sky in the same blurry vividness as the illustration, his pockets empty but his hands full of bottles that sang with harmonized sorrow and hope. <words>214</words>
He walked home, deciding to sell none, instead planting the ghost orchid's seeds in his estate's ruined greenhouse, knowing that some legacies are meant to be grown, not spent. <words>228</words>
Years later, when the roller coaster finally collapsed, visitors reported hearing laughter that sounded like absinthe being poured, and seeing an aristocrat in a tattered coat walking between worlds, forever teaching the secret recipes to those who chose to walk instead of drive. <words>243</words>
