The vigilant orchardist, known for being never tardy, arrived at the paper airplane test facility at 0600 sharp, volunteering to prune the decorative fruit trees that lined the wind tunnels. <words>29</words>
He carried an antique letter seal in his pocket, the brass griffin tarnished by grief and the salt of tears he refused to shed after his daughter’s plane—an innocent paper prototype—had been weaponized in a classified crash. <words>42</words>
Every Tuesday throughout volunteering, he demonstrated the same ritual: pocket watch click, secateurs snap, then a slow stroll beneath the fluorescent rafters where engineers lofted gliders like gossip. <words>31</words>
He claimed he was studying airflow, but really he was unraveling conspiracies via the patterns in a peacock's tail painted on the hangar’s far wall, a mural commissioned by the same board that buried the crash report. <words>36</words>
The mural’s eyespots, he noticed, shifted weekly; one iris would darken, another would sprout a cryptic comma, and the vigilant orchardist logged each change in a ledger disguised as pruning notes. <words>33</words>
Sardonic glee curled his lip when he matched the newest comma to the tail number of a classified drone, the same model rumored to have swapped payloads with his daughter’s harmless flyer. <words>32</words>
He pressed the antique letter seal into soft wax on a forged memo, resealing the envelope after swapping the flight-test roster so that the guilty project manager would pilot the next suspect drone himself. <words>34</words>
Volunteering hours ended at dusk, yet he stayed, never tardy for his own agenda, timing the facility’s ventilation cycles to the second. <words>25</words>
At 19:47, the peacock’s central eye blinked—a maintenance hatch sliding open—revealing a fiber-optic cable whose color sequence repeated the mural’s altered dots. <words>30</words>
He clipped the cable with pruning sheers, splicing in a transmitter no larger than a cherry pit, then rerouted the feed to a public livestream titled “Garden Variety Justice.” <words>30</words>
The next morning, the board gathered beneath the mural for a ribbon-cutting on a new bomber glider; the vigilant orchardist stood among them, offering cider from his own harvest, tart enough to make them pucker. <words>34</words>
When the drone lifted, the hacked feed broadcast cockpit chatter confessing the cover-up, and the mural’s peacock seemed to smirk, tail feathers shimmering with projected data like a fan of receipts. <words>32</words>
Security rushed in, but the vigilant orchardist was already outside, pocketing the antique letter seal, its griffin now gleaming with reflected sardonic glee. <words>27</words>
He walked back to his orchard, never tardy for the sunset pruning that, for once, felt less like penance and more like planting seeds for someone else’s safer sky. <words>31</words>
