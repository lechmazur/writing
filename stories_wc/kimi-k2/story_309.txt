<story>
Detective Mara Voss, overworked and under-caffeinated, stepped into the Vanishing Point Gallery during the hush that follows the final siren, when even the city seemed to hold its breath. <words>31</words>
The place was closing forever at midnight, its walls already half-stripped, the art sold or stolen, leaving only echoes and dust. <words>42</words>
She was here for one thing: a single playing card, the Queen of Spades, slipped into the evidence bag of a suicide that refused to stay neat. <words>55</words>
The card had belonged to her brother, Luca, dead ten years tonight, and tonight it had turned up again like a bad punchline. <words>68</words>
Mara’s motivation was simple, stupid, human: to outdance a looming inevitability—her own unraveling—by proving the past could still be rearranged. <words>82</words>
She moved through the gutted rooms, molten sarcasm dripping from her lips: “Great, another farewell tour for the already forgotten.” <words>94</words>
Her flashlight beam jittered across a half-damaged kaleidoscope lying on a plinth, its mirrors cracked like old promises. <words>106</words>
She picked it up, confidently unsure whether she was chasing evidence or ghosts, and pressed the eyepiece to her socket. <words>119</words>
Via the fleeting images in the kaleidoscope, memories detonated: Luca laughing, shuffling that same Queen of Spades between his fingers, promising he’d quit the game before it quit him. <words>135</words>
The shards of colored glass spun, showing her the night he jumped, the card fluttering down after him like a black-winged apology. <words>149</words>
She rummaged through the debris of the gallery, kicking aside bubble wrap and broken frames, hunting for the physical card that might anchor the memory before it dissolved. <words>164</words>
Each step echoed louder in the hush, mocking her belief that objects could pin down grief. <words>175</words>
In the last room, a projector flickered, looping security footage of the suicide—Luca’s final patron, a woman in red, placing the Queen on the dead man’s chest. <words>190</words>
Mara froze, molten sarcasm cooling into something sharper: recognition. <words>199</words>
The woman was her, ten years younger, undercover, wearing red because Luca said it was lucky. <words>211</words>
The kaleidoscope slipped from her fingers, clattered, and the mirrors settled into a single, stable image: the Queen winking. <words>224</words>
She laughed, a cracked sound that ricocheted off the bare walls. <words>233</words>
Memory wasn’t a file to reopen; it was a card palmed by time, dealt again and again until the deck ran out. <words>246</words>
Mara pocketed the kaleidoscope instead of the card—let the fracture carry the weight—and walked toward the exit as the gallery lights dimmed to black. <words>261</words>
Outside, the city exhaled, sirens starting up again like applause for a performance no one asked for. <words>274</words>
She lit a cigarette with hands that no longer shook, tasting ash and inevitability, and decided the dance wasn’t over; it had just changed partners. <words>288</words>
The Queen of Spades stayed behind, pinned under a spotlight that no longer existed, a memory finally allowed to vanish at its own vanishing point. <words>303</words>
Mara walked into the night, carrying only the cracked kaleidoscope and the knowledge that some ghosts are lighter when you stop trying to hold them. <words>318</words>
