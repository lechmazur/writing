In the steampunk airship engine room, brass pistons still ticked like reluctant heartbeats after the final guest left the wedding above. <words>25</words>
I, the freelancer who freelances everything—mechanic, poet, stenographer—lingered in the hush, amber ring glinting on my oil-smudged finger. <words>42</words>
The ring had been slipped to me by the bride’s grandmother, a woman whose last good intention was to have her memories preserved before the fog took her. <words>61</words>
She had whispered, “Chronicle elder wisdom before the engines drown it,” her voice inadvertently profound, like a cracked bell that still rings true. <words>82</words>
I set my portable chronograph to record, gears meshing with the rhythm of waves against a cliff far below the hovering hull. <words>103</words>
Steam hissed in scattered harmony, valves sighing in counterpoint to the distant string quartet now packing away their instruments upstairs. <words>125</words>
The grandmother’s memories arrived as flickers: a childhood on tidal cliffs, a lost sister, a promise sealed with this same amber ring. <words>149</words>
Each pulse of the engines threatened to erase a syllable, so I had to outwit forgetting itself. <words>170</words>
I rerouted coolant lines to create a percussive code, tapping the ring against brass pipes in the rhythm of waves against a cliff, translating heartbeats into Morse. <words>198</words>
The amber caught the gaslight, trapping golden flecks like suspended yesterdays, and I realized the ring was a lens, not just a relic. <words>223</words>
Holding it to the chronograph’s aperture, I projected the grandmother’s memories onto spinning flywheels, images flickering across polished copper. <words>250</words>
A younger version of her danced barefoot on wet stone, laughing at gulls, the scene looping with the cadence of the sea. <words>275</words>
The engine’s tempo slowed, respecting the story, and the scattered harmony resolved into a single, sustained chord of steam. <words>299</words>
I sealed the recording inside a vacuum tube addressed to the newlyweds, labeling it “For your first anniversary, when memory needs a compass.” <words>330</words>
As I left the engine room, the amber ring felt lighter, as if the last good intention had finally been delivered from its golden prison. <words>358</words>
Up on the observation deck, the airship drifted above moonlit cliffs, and I could almost hear the old woman’s voice riding the wind. <words>385</words>
Freelancer of everything, I pocketed my fee—two copper coins and a sprig of rosemary—knowing some jobs pay in time reclaimed. <words>413</words>
The engines resumed their ordinary thunder, yet beneath it lingered the rhythm of waves against a cliff, keeping the story alive. <words>440</words>
I stepped into the night, pockets full of other people’s yesterdays, already composing the next contract in the scattered harmony of stars. <words>467</words>
Somewhere below, the tide turned, and the cliff echoed back the grandmother’s laughter, inadvertently profound, endlessly repeating. <words>492</words>
