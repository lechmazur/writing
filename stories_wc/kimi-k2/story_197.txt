In the hush after a child’s last bedtime story, when the house itself seemed to hold its breath, the high-altitude con artist known only as Lira perched on a branch of the yggdrasil-like tree that grew through the skylight of the nursery. <words>46</words>
She balanced on a limb no thicker than a promise, her coat of patchwork twilight fluttering like a piece of fabric scrap torn from the sky’s own hem. <words>31</words>
Below, the child slept with a fist curled around a stuffed star, unaware that this was the hour when nightmares collided in the hollows between heartbeats. <words>31</words>
Lira’s job was not to steal, but to soothe; her con was compassion, and tonight she needed to compose a cosmic lullaby before the terrors stitched themselves into the child’s dreams. <words>34</words>
The tree pulsed faintly, its bark etched with runes that rearranged daily, spelling warnings in languages that had never been spoken aloud. <words>26</words>
From her pocket she drew a set of sticky notes, each scrawled with a fragment of melody, their colors muted by the pristine chaos of starlight filtering through leaves that shimmered like shattered mirrors. <words>34</words>
Every dusk the notes reordered themselves into nonsense, a cipher of fear; every night she unscrambled them, further into coherence, by matching the pitch of the child’s breathing to the rhythm of the stars. <words>36</words>
Tonight the sequence resisted, clinging to discord like frost to glass. <words>14</words>
She pressed the first note to the bark; it stuck, then slid, then stuck again, as though the tree itself were nervous. <words>24</words>
A low hum rose, not from the tree but from the air, a mundanely terrifying sound like a lullaby played backward on a broken music box. <words>28</words>
Lira’s fingers trembled; she had heard this before, the moment when the nightmares realized they were being rewritten. <words>22</words>
She sang the second note softly, a single syllable that tasted like copper and snow, and the branch beneath her feet grew colder, as if winter were climbing up from the roots. <words>33</words>
The sticky notes fluttered, rearranging themselves into a spiral that pointed toward the child’s window. <words>18</words>
She followed, step by step, voice steady, weaving the melody into the silence until the hum softened into a sigh. <words>24</words>
The final note was blank; she hesitated, then pressed her own heartbeat against it, letting the rhythm become the last line of the lullaby. <words>29</words>
The tree exhaled, leaves folding like hands in prayer, and the nightmares, denied their cradle, drifted upward into the dark, becoming just another constellation the child would never fear to name. <words>36</words>
Lira tucked the piece of fabric scrap into the crook of the branch, a promise that she would return tomorrow, when the notes would scramble again and the tree would wait, patient and vast, for the next lullaby to be born from pristine chaos. <words>45</words>
