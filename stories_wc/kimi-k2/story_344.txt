In the hush of improbable beginnings, the floating rock tea house drifted above an abyssal trench, its paper lanterns glowing like jellyfish. <words>25</words>
Mara, an underwater explorer who wore her wire-rimmed glasses over a rebreather mask, steadied herself against the lacquered rail, fighting the claustrophobia that squeezed her ribs whenever the sea pressed too close. <words>42</words>
She had come not for treasure but to study human behaviors, believing that the way people poured tea at the edge of the world would reveal more than any census. <words>58</words>
The tea master, a lightly heavyhearted woman named Lin, greeted her with a jar of 1897 plum jam salvaged from a sunken liner. <words>75</words>
“Taste,” Lin whispered, offering a silver spoon. <words>82</words>
Mara obeyed, letting the dark sweetness bloom across her tongue; by tasting subtle differences in old jam recipes she could map the moods of the long-dead cook—today, grief seasoned with defiance. <words>104</words>
The flavor seemed to inflame the memory of her own mother’s last batch, made the week before the accident that had trapped Mara in a collapsed cave and seeded her fear. <words>127</words>
Lin watched the tremor in Mara’s gloved hand and, without permission, pressed two fingers to the pulse at her wrist. <words>147</words>
Warmth spread like sunrise, the healing touch not magical but simply human, steady as ballast. <words>165</words>
Mara’s breath slowed; the walls of the tea house widened, the ocean outside becoming scenery instead of threat. <words>183</words>
She asked Lin why she served strangers on a rock that might sink tomorrow. <words>199</words>
“Because beginnings are always improbable,” Lin replied, refilling the cups with tea that tasted of smoke and glacier water. <words>220</words>
Mara recorded the answer in her waterproof journal, noting how Lin’s shoulders softened when guests laughed, how the jam jar was turned so its chipped side faced the wall. <words>248</words>
Night deepened; the lanterns flickered, and the rock shifted, groaning like a whale. <words>266</words>
Claustrophobia stirred again, but Mara placed her own hand over Lin’s, returning the borrowed calm. <words>285</words>
Together they steadied cups sliding across the table, quietly bold against the sway. <words>302</words>
When the tremor passed, Lin offered another spoonful of jam; this time Mara tasted hope, tart and new. <words>323</words>
She realized that studying human behaviors meant allowing herself to be one more datum, vulnerable and seen. <words>347</words>
Before dawn, she removed her glasses, cleaned the salt from the lenses, and set them beside the empty jar as a promise to return. <words>372</words>
Lin tucked a fresh jar into Mara’s satchel, its wax seal still warm. <words>389</words>
As the tea house lifted on the tide, Mara descended the rope ladder toward her submersible, heart buoyant, fear no longer a cage but a compass pointing toward the next fragile, improbable beginning. <words>420</words>
