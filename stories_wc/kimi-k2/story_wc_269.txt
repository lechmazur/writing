The sea level monitoring station at Kiritimati rose on stilts like a heron asleep, its solar panels tilted toward a sun that no longer burned oil to reach it. [34]  
Inside, Mara, once a coral bleaching witness, now keeper of the gauges, traced the torn-out atlas page with a fingertip that still remembered the ghost-white reef. [52]  
The missing fragment showed the shipping lane east of Banaba; every updated chart she downloaded now erased that lane as if it had never been. [70]  
After the fossil fuel ban, captains had switched to wind and current, yet some routes still vanished, and her job was to discover why some paths disappear. [89]  
She believed the answer lay in the rhythms the ocean tapped against the hollow legs of the station, a practice of tapping rhythms on surfaces she had learned from her grandfather, who said the sea spoke in code. [113]  
Each dusk she pressed her ear to the titanium wall and knocked back with her knuckles: three short, two long, pause, one short. [132]  
The station answered, sometimes with a shiver, sometimes with silence, but never with words. [148]  
Tonight the reply came as a tremor that loosened the atlas page from its clip; it drifted to the floor and landed beside a rusted tide gauge whose needle moved though no water touched it. [172]  
Mara felt the room stretch, the moment periodically eternal, as if the walls breathed in slow centuries instead of seconds. [191]  
She knelt, lifted the page, and noticed fresh ink bleeding through from the other side—coordinates not printed but scrawled in a hand she recognized as her own yet had never written. [213]  
The numbers pointed to a spot the charts now labeled only as “unsounded.” [225]  
She gathered tools to assemble a raft from the station’s emergency pontoons, lash sensors to its frame, and ride the same pulse she used to interrogate the pillars. [248]  
Windless night folded around her as she lowered the raft; bioluminescent plankton lit the seams like solder. [265]  
She paddled by memory, tapping the gunwale in the same pattern, letting the ocean guide her through darkness that felt less like absence and more like withheld information. [287]  
Hours drifted; the raft’s shadow merged with a darker absence ahead—a circular slick where stars drowned. [303]  
Here the water was glass, no swell, no chop, only the faint heartbeat of the planet pulsing beneath. [320]  
She dipped a sensor; it screamed a single note then died, its screen flashing the same coordinates from the atlas page. [339]  
Mara understood the delayed revelation: the routes had not been erased; they had been folded, creased by pressure until ships could no longer unfold them. [360]  
She tapped the surface again, asking permission. [368]  
The circle answered with a soft pop, and a disc of water hinged upward like a lid, revealing a spiral ramp of salt descending into blue-black. [388]  
She hesitated, but the raft, moored to nothing, slid forward as if drawn by an invisible current. [405]  
Down the spiral she drifted, walls glittering with fossil shells that still remembered sunlight. [422]  
At the bottom lay a chamber where currents braided into a loom; each strand carried the echo of a vanished voyage. [440]  
An old brass sextant floated at the center, its mirrors webbed with cracks that reflected not stars but the faces of captains who had trusted the missing lane. [462]  
Mara reached for it, and the sextant unfolded into the torn atlas page, now complete, the lane restored as a silver thread. [482]  
The thread stitched itself into the loom, and the chamber brightened; she saw the reef she had watched bleach, now glowing again in impossible color. [503]  
A voice—not heard but tapped against her ribs—said, “Paths do not vanish; they wait for witnesses willing to descend.” [525]  
The raft lifted, carrying her up the spiral as the lid of water closed above, sealing the secret until another witness arrived. [546]  
Back at the station, dawn painted the panels rose; she clipped the restored page to the wall and felt the building settle, no longer drifting moored but anchored to both sky and abyss. [574]  
She resumed her vigil, tapping the wall at dusk, knowing the ocean would answer differently each time, its code periodically eternal, its revelations always delayed until the right rhythm was risked. [603]  
Some nights she saw ships sailing the silver thread far below, their sails white as living coral, their wakes writing new lanes across the unsounded dark. [628]  
She logged no data, filed no
