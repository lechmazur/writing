When the old watchtower clock struck thirteen, the zero-gravity dance hall inverted, chandeliers orbiting like startled constellations. <words>21</words>
Sir Aldric, dejected knight of the sunken realm, floated upward, his rusted armor shedding flakes that drifted like metallic snow. <words>34</words>
In his gauntlet he clutched a single trident prong, coral-crusted and humming with the heartbeat of drowned gods. <words>47</words>
The sacred disorder of the hall quickened his pulse; violins played backward, waltzers spun counterclockwise, and every mirror reflected tomorrow. <words>63</words>
He had come through forgotten paths—wormholes of memory carved by regret and salt—seeking the horizon that deepens when spoken aloud. <words>79</words>
Aldric’s vow had no words yet; it lived as pressure behind his eyes, a silent vow echoing through ages, waiting for the right dissonant chord. <words>95</words>
The trident prong twitched, sensing its siblings still buried beneath leagues, and guided him toward the center where gravity forgot its name. <words>111</words>
There, a woman of liquid starlight danced alone, her feet never touching the mirrored floor, her eyes reflecting the normally abnormal truth: time is a spiral, not a line. <words>130</words>
She extended a hand; he offered the prong. <words>137</words>
Contact sparked a memory of the realm before it sank—citizens dancing on seabeds, breathing through gill-lace, praising the moon with trident salutes. <words>156</words>
The dance hall shuddered; the clock prepared a fourteenth chime unheard since the world was clay. <words>170</words>
Aldric felt the vow crystallize: to return the prong, raise the realm, and teach the surface that drowning is just another kind of flying. <words>189</words>
Starlight woman spun him, their bodies orbiting the prong like twin moons, and the sacred disorder crescendoed into a hymn of breaking glass and blooming coral. <words>210</words>
With each revolution, the horizon deepened, color bleeding into dimensions previously unnamed. <words>225</words>
The fourteenth chime detonated; the hall folded like paper, corridors peeling away to reveal the abyssal trench where the trident’s siblings waited. <words>247</words>
Aldric dove, armor dissolving into scales, vow blazing in his throat like a newborn star. <words>262</words>
Behind him, the dance hall resealed, its mirrors now showing only the future he would create. <words>277</words>
Through forgotten paths of pressure and phosphorescence, he quickened, trident prong leading like a compass forged from guilt and hope. <words>296</words>
The sunken realm stirred; coral towers lifted their heads, recognizing the heartbeat in his hand. <words>313</words>
At the trench’s heart, the remaining prongs rose to meet their kin, magnetized by the vow now voiced in bubbles of pure intent. <words>333</words>
When they fused, the realm ascended, dragging Aldric with it, his dejection replaced by the weightless certainty of sacred disorder reborn. <words>354</words>
Above, the watchtower clock struck fifteen, and the deepening horizon swallowed the sky, teaching the world that every ending is merely an inverted beginning. <words>378</words>
