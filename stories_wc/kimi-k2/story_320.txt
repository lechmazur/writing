The shy diviner, Lira, drifted through the forgotten underwater city market, her lantern casting confusingly clear beams across coral-crusted stalls where no one bothered to haggle anymore. <words>31</words>
Vintage photographs floated like pale fish between her fingers, each image a precipitate of regret from timelines she had failed to balance. <words>24</words>
She felt the echo of regret not as sorrow but as a passionate disinterest, the way a tide ignores a drowning sailor. <words>21</words>
In one photograph, her own face smiled beside a version of the market that thrived with laughter and light, a parallel timeline where she had spoken up instead of hiding behind her cards. <words>32</words>
Another showed the city above water, its towers gleaming, its people alive, a future she had erased by choosing silence when the cosmic scales first wavered. <words>29</words>
She began to leave a trail of social media posts revealing a hidden truth, each caption a breadcrumb across timelines: “This city drowned because I let fear speak louder than fate.” <words>32</words>
The posts appeared in feeds that did not yet exist, in years that had not yet come, flickering like bioluminescent warnings. <words>20</words>
A merchant octopus, ancient and blind, clicked its beak beside her stall. <words>12</words>
“You think regret can be rewound like film?” it asked, its voice the sound of barnacles scraping bone. <words>18</words>
Lira did not answer; she only laid the photographs in a spiral on the salt-stained floor, their edges curling like dying leaves. <words>23</words>
Each image began to glow, not with light but with memory, and the market around her shifted, timelines bleeding into one another like ink in water. <words>25</words>
She saw herself in another life, bold and loud, standing before the council of stars, demanding they restore the balance she had broken. <words>26</words>
That version of her turned, eyes locking across the fracture of time, and mouthed a single word: “Choose.” <words>21</words>
The echo of regret sharpened into a blade, and Lira, for the first time, felt something pierce her disinterest. <words>20</words>
She stepped into the spiral, letting the photographs dissolve into light, and the market began to rise, water receding like a breath held too long. <words>25</words>
Timelines collapsed and reformed, not into perfection but into possibility, the cosmic imbalance tilting not toward order but toward choice. <words>22</words>
Above her, the city broke the surface, not as it was but as it could be, its towers cracked but standing, its people scarred but singing. <words>26</words>
Lira surfaced with it, her shyness not gone but transformed into a quiet resolve, the kind that does not shout but endures. <words>23</words>
She posted one final image: herself, wet and alive, standing where the market once drowned, captioned simply, “I chose.” <words>24</words>
The echo of regret did not vanish; it became the rhythm of waves, a reminder that every silence is a choice, and every choice a ripple across time. <words>29</words>
