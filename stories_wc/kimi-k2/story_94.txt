In the year 2187, when time travel had become as common as coffee, Lira Vale ran a heartbreak clinic above a sky reflection pool that mirrored every cloud like a memory too sharp to forget. <words>34</words>
She styled herself a femme fatale heartbreak counselor, wearing amber earrings that once belonged to a lover who had zipped centuries ahead and never returned. <words>27</words>
The earrings glowed like fossilized honey, and legend claimed they bent gravity around the wearer's desires, a rumor Lira neither confirmed nor denied to the restless souls who sought her. <words>29</words>
Each client arrived carrying the weight of choices made across timelines, and Lira listened with cautious impulsiveness, her questions soft yet barbed, coaxing confessions that shimmered like heat above the mirrored water. <words>32</words>
She was restlessly curious about the exact moment desire turned into gravity, the instant want became a planet you could never leave, and so she tracked cloud trails across the pool, mapping longing in cumulus and cirrus. <words>36</words>
One dusk, a traveler stepped from the chronal dock, coat smelling of ozone and regret, claiming he had come to proclaim himself free in a cage of illusions he himself had built. <words>32</words>
Lira recognized the amber glint at his throat: a shard from the same prehistoric resin as her earrings, proof their timelines had once intersected and splintered. <words>27</words>
She invited him to sit at the pool’s edge, where the sky below looked more real than the sky above, and asked what shape his cage took. <words>26</words>
He said it was a city that reset every midnight to the day he left her, forcing him to relive the leaving until he no longer knew whether departure was freedom or punishment. <words>33</words>
Lira leaned closer, earrings swinging like pendulums, and whispered that desire’s gravity could be reversed if one were willing to fall upward through the reflection. <words>28</words>
He laughed, the sound brittle, and accused her of selling the same illusion she claimed to cure. <words>18</words>
Instead of arguing, Lira unclasped one amber drop and let it fall; it zipped across the pool’s surface, skipping like a stone across time, leaving ripples that showed futures where he stayed and she left. <words>35</words>
The traveler stared, saw himself aged and content, saw Lira boarding a chronal skiff without regret, saw the city dissolve when its architect finally walked away. <words>28</words>
Tears blurred the reflection, and in them he felt the cage loosen, its bars turning to vapor the moment he admitted he had carried the key all along. <words>27</words>
Lira clasped the remaining earring, now lighter, and told him the pool only reflected what the heart refused to release; freedom began when the image no longer hurt to watch. <words>32</words>
He stepped into the water, clothes dry, gravity reassembling around his newfound lightness, and vanished into a cloud that drifted beyond the frame of the sky. <words>27</words>
Lira stayed, restlessly curious, tracking the next cloud trail, amber glinting like a question she would spend lifetimes answering. <words>22</words>
