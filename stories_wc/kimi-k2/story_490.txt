After the waves recede from a deserted shore, the caravan repair station stands like a rusted ribcage against the salt-stained sky. <words>23</words>
Inside, the fading caretaker—once a mechanic, now a ghost of grease and memory—methodically random in his rituals, arranges dried lavender bundles along the cracked windowsills as if scent could solder broken axles. <words>42</words>
He claims the fragrance keeps the forbidden at bay, though everyone knows the allure of the forbidden is the only thing still breathing here. <words>57</words>
Each dusk he hacks ancient archives on a wheezing terminal, fingers dancing with enthusiastic apathy across keys that stick like guilty secrets. <words>75</words>
The archives speak of a route beyond the dunes where caravans vanished, lured by a light that cradles the unknown like a newborn galaxy. <words>93</words>
He tells no one he has already tasted that light—one sip, one gorge of radiance that left his pupils star-shaped and his heart ticking backward. <words>111</words>
Tonight the lavender crumbles between his palms, releasing purple dust that settles on oil-stained blueprints like bruises on old love letters. <words>129</words>
A single file flickers open: coordinates, warnings, a promise that the forbidden is not a place but a direction. <words>146</words>
He laughs, the sound a dry gearbox grinding itself to silence, and pockets the last bundle as if it were a fuse. <words>163</words>
Outside, the tide has retreated farther than ever, exposing a black road of wet sand that glints like obsidian gears. <words>181</words>
He steps onto it, boots sinking, carrying the terminal under one arm and the lavender under the other—methodically random, deliberately lost. <words>200</words>
The station behind him sighs, shutters clapping in the wind like slow applause for a departing fool. <words>217</words>
Halfway to the horizon the sand begins to hum, a frequency that rattles his teeth and rearranges the stars into a spiral arm he almost remembers. <words>236</words>
He kneels, lays the lavender in a circle, and places the terminal at its center like an offering to a god who prefers code to incense. <words>254</words>
The screen flares violet, projecting glyphs that taste of copper and midnight; he leans in, ready to gorge again on the forbidden script. <words>272</words>
This time he does not stop at one sip—he drinks until the words overflow his mouth and spill down his chin in liquid constellations. <words>290</words>
The caretaker feels his edges dissolve, not into death but into cartography; he becomes the map he always repaired yet never followed. <words>309</words>
Lavender ignites without flame, scent turning solid, lifting him above the sand in a cradle of purple light. <words>327</words>
Below, the caravan repair station flickers once, twice, then folds into itself like a closing eye. <words>344</words>
He hovers, neither ecstatic nor afraid, suspended in enthusiastic apathy while the newborn galaxy inside his chest begins its first slow rotation. <words>364</words>
Somewhere, axles mend themselves, engines wake, and caravans prepare to roll toward the place where caretakers become constellations. <words>383</words>
He exhales, and the lavender ash drifts down, seeding the wet sand with tiny purple stars that will guide the next wave of forbidden seekers. <words>403</words>
