In the ember alcove of the ruined conservatory, where mist clung to broken columns like unfinished phrases, the diligent orchestra copyist bent over her last surviving score. [34]  
The paper was brittle, the ink fading, yet she copied each note with the same precision she had used before the story famine, when tales had withered from the air like drought-struck leaves. [55]  
She worked by the shortwave radio dial glow, a faint green circle that pulsed on the cracked casing of the set her father once used to chase weather reports across the sea. [77]  
Tonight the dial was alive again, twitching toward frequencies no licensed station claimed, and she felt the thistled calm that always preceded the pirate broadcast. [99]  
The signal arrived as an elusive song lyric, half-remembered, half-invented: “dust remembers every footstep if you ask in the right key.” [120]  
She whispered the line, and the dust on the marble floor stirred, forming tiny spirals that spelled fragments of forgotten tales. [141]  
This was why she stayed after the others fled: to teach dust to tell stories, to coax memory from motes, to prove that narrative could be replanted even in barren minds. [166]  
The radio crackled; a voice cloaked in static and sea salt announced, “Listeners in shadow, tune your hearts to 4.7 megahertz, where the secretly luminous gather.” [190]  
She adjusted the knob, and the dial glow brightened, casting her face in submarine light. [208]  
From the speaker came a violin line she herself had transcribed years ago for a symphony that never premiered, a melody now bent into a new shape, as if the pirate had found the score in a sunken trunk and breathed on it. [238]  
The copyist’s fingers itched to write, but she had no blank pages left, so she lifted a pinch of the dancing dust and let it settle across the staves, each grain lodging in a notehead, making the ink glisten like dew. [268]  
The lyric returned, stretched into a question: “Will you cloak this tune in silence, or let it wander?” [287]  
She understood the method: the pirate sent not finished stories but seeds, melodies that carried narrative possibility, and only a careful listener could unfold them into words. [312]  
She closed her eyes, humming the violin line, and the dust rearranged itself into the shape of a small book, its cover woven from golden motes. [336]  
Opening the phantom volume, she saw scenes: a child learning to read by candlelight, a sailor knotting stories into rope, a librarian who shelved laughter in glass jars. [364]  
Each scene dissolved back into dust, yet left a residue of meaning on her tongue, sweet and sharp as thistle down. [385]  
The radio voice softened: “Copyist, your diligence has kept the bones of music intact; now lend them flesh.” [405]  
She pressed her palm to the glowing dial, feeling its warmth seep through skin to marrow, and the green light flared, briefly illuminating the entire alcove like sunrise trapped in jade. [435]  
In that radiance she saw the outline of the pirate: no rogue captain but an old woman wearing headphones patched with tape, seated in a candlelit shack somewhere beyond the mist. [465]  
Their eyes met across the static, and the pirate smiled, raising a conductor’s baton carved from driftwood. [485]  
The copyist lifted her own pencil like a baton in reply, and together they began the downbeat. [503]  
The dust rose in a column, swirling into the shapes of instruments—violin, cello, oboe—each made of glimmering particles that sang without strings or reeds. [530]  
Music filled the alcove, not loud but pervasive, a thistled calm threaded with urgency, as if every lost story were exhaling at once. [554]  
She conducted, translating the pirate’s broadcast into notation that etched itself across the air, visible only where dust caught the light. [578]  
When the final chord faded, the dust settled into a thin layer across the floor, but now each mote carried a word, a note, a heartbeat. [602]  
The radio dial dimmed to its usual ghost-green, and the pirate’s voice whispered, “Keep them safe until ears grow hungry again.” [625]  
The copyist bowed, tears mixing with the dust on her cheeks, tasting salt and ink and distant thunder. [645]  
She gathered the luminous motes into a small glass vial, corked it, and tucked it inside her coat, next to her heart. [666]  
Outside, the mist began to lift, revealing the first pale stars, and
