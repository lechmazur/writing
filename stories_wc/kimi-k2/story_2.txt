In the iridescent cave inside a giant crystal geode, skeptical spiritual medium Mara knelt, her flashlight dimmed to respect the hush when a roller coaster stalls at its peak. <words>31</words>
She had come here during the peculiarly frequent lull between midnight screams from the distant amusement park, believing the silence would strengthen her resolve to learn forgotten crafts. <words>28</words>
The centaur horseshoe with runes lay before her, its iron still warm as if freshly thrown, and the mists of uncertainty curled around her ankles like curious cats. <words>27</words>
Mara, who made her living speaking to the dead yet doubted every syllable, felt the brazen humility of a fraud seeking truth in a place that owed her nothing. <words>26</words>
She opened the leather-bound grimoire she had bought that morning, and by the scent of a new book—paper, glue, and promise—she began the first ritual of unlearning. <words>28</words>
The runes on the horseshoe shifted, rearranging themselves into a script older than skepticism, and Mara traced them with a tremor she refused to call faith. <words>25</words>
Each symbol tasted like iron and starlight; she swallowed them, letting the mists of uncertainty thicken until the cave walls blurred into violet auroras. <words>24</words>
A memory surfaced: her grandmother forging nails from meteorite iron, whispering that craft was merely memory wearing work gloves. <words>22</words>
Mara pressed the horseshoe to her sternum, feeling it pulse like a second heart, and the peculiarly frequent tremors in her hands steadied into the rhythm of a hammer she had never swung. <words>29</words>
The geode's crystals began to sing, a low chord that resonated in her ribs, and she understood the forgotten craft was not speaking to the dead but listening to what refused to die. <words>29</words>
She laughed, the sound echoing with brazen humility, because the dead had never needed her voice—they needed her silence, her willingness to strengthen their unfinished stories. <words>27</words>
The roller coaster outside released its breath, cars swooping downward, and the hush ended, yet the cave held its own quiet, deeper than manufactured fear. <words>24</words>
Mara stood, slipping the horseshoe into her pocket where it hummed against her phone, and walked toward the exit, the mists of uncertainty now trailing her like apprentices. <words>28</words>
She would return to her storefront séances, but tonight she had learned the first forgotten craft: how to carry wonder without selling it, how to doubt without closing the door. <words>29</words>
As she stepped into the neon night, the scent of a new book still clung to her fingers, a promise that every page she had not yet read was another geode waiting to be opened. <words>30</words>
