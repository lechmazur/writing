In the drought prediction center's humming server room, cautious smuggler Lira Voss pressed the pressed butterfly between her gloved fingers, its wings still bright despite decades inside a smuggler's tin. <words>31</words>
She had stolen it from the painter's studio an hour ago, knowing the specimen contained musical memories encoded in microscopic grooves along its veins—an illegal archive of every song the painter had ever loved. <words>42</words>
The center's monitors flickered with red drought zones while Lira worked, her meticulously impulsive nature manifesting in the precise yet frantic way she calibrated the anesthesia drip for the painter's confession. <words>33</words>
"Three milliliters more," she whispered, her voice carrying enthusiastic apathy—the paradoxical tone she'd perfected to hide how desperately she needed what came next. <words>27</words>
The painter lay strapped to the examination chair, eyelids fluttering as the drug took hold, and Lira leaned close to predict which memories would surface through his delirious confessions under anesthesia. <words>32</words>
She wasn't here for state secrets or weather data; Lira sought to become a master of empathy by stealing the emotional resonance of others, bottling their joy and sorrow like rare spices. <words>31</words>
"Tell me about the butterfly," she prompted, and the painter's drug-loosened tongue began its musical journey. <words>19</words>
He sang of his grandmother humming lullabies while pressing specimens, each note embedding itself in the butterfly's wings through some forgotten alchemy of love and formaldehyde. <words>30</words>
Lira recorded everything, her supposedly empty heart racing as the painter's memories flooded through her equipment, transforming into data she could later inject into her own neural pathways. <words>31</words>
But something unexpected happened—the cautious smuggler who'd spent years stealing emotions found herself crying, real tears mixing with the butterfly's dust as the painter described teaching his daughter to waltz. <words>35</words>
"She's gone now," the painter confessed, his voice cracking, "drought took the lake where we danced, took her too when she went back for our sheet music." <words>30</words>
Lira's meticulously impulsive fingers hesitated over the extraction controls, her enthusiastic apathy crumbling like dried earth as she realized the butterfly wasn't just data—it was someone's entire capacity for love. <words>34</words>
Instead of stealing, she pressed the specimen back into the painter's palm, her transformation beginning not through theft but through the simple act of listening to his grief. <words>29</words>
When he woke hours later, the drought prediction center's alarms still blaring, Lira was gone, but the butterfly remained, and in its wings, the painter swore he could hear a new song—one that sounded like forgiveness. <words>38</words>
Lira left her smuggler's tin behind, having learned that empathy couldn't be stolen or synthesized; it had to be earned through bearing witness to another's pain. <words>30</words>
The drought would come regardless of predictions, but somewhere in the cracked earth, a cautious smuggler walked toward redemption, her empty tin now filled with something far more valuable than stolen songs. <words>35</words>
