Dr. Mara Ellison stepped through the warped aluminum door of the storm-damaged greenhouse, her boots crunching on shattered glass and desiccated leaves. [21]  
The flood had retreated three weeks ago, but the air still carried the sour smell of drowned orchids and rusting iron. [34]  
She had come here not for botany, but for the butterfly house at the far end, where monarch wings once flashed like stained glass. [50]  
Mara was a neutron star researcher, accustomed to watching matter collapse under its own gravity in milliseconds, yet she had learned that the most profound changes were the ones that took years to notice. [73]  
After the flood, she had begun to preprocess reality, running quiet simulations in her mind before speaking or acting, as if buffering the world to soften its edges. [96]  
She believed that stripping needless drama from catastrophe was the only kindness left. [110]  
The greenhouse roof had peeled back like a tin can, letting in rain that pooled in the aisles and rotted the soil. [127]  
Sunlight now slanted through the torn panels, illuminating motes that drifted like slow comets. [143]  
Mara knelt beside a toppled milkweed planter and found a single monarch wing, still bright orange but powdered with gray dust. [162]  
She lifted it with tweezers, recognizing the dust as scales shed during the butterfly’s final, frantic flight before the storm. [181]  
In her lab she had watched neutron stars decay through accumulated dust patterns—radioactive silicates condensing into whisper-thin rings that told the story of a star’s slow surrender. [208]  
Here, the dust on the wing recorded a smaller collapse: a species shrinking year by year until only fragments remained. [227]  
She placed the wing on a cracked glass slide and photographed it with her phone, then opened the spectral-analysis app she had written for pulsar debris. [251]  
The app translated the dust into a frequency map, each pixel a note in a requiem played over decades. [268]  
Mara felt the kindled humility that always arrived when the universe revealed its patient arithmetic. [284]  
She had once published papers on millisecond magnetars, proud of her precision, but the greenhouse taught her that gradual change was harder to measure and more honest. [309]  
A drip from the broken irrigation line tapped against a metal tray, marking time like a metronome. [327]  
She followed the sound to a bench where a chrysalis still hung, its silk thread frayed but intact. [344]  
The chrysalis was blackened, not with mold but with the same dust that coated the wing. [359]  
Mara realized the butterfly inside had never emerged; it had decayed in place, surrendering its pigments to the air one scale at a time. [380]  
She imagined the storm as a neutron-star glitch, a sudden lurch that scattered the greenhouse’s fragile orbits. [398]  
Yet the aftermath was not explosion but erosion, the slow giving-away that followed every violent beginning. [415]  
She collected more wings—three, then seven, then twelve—each flecked with the same spectral signature. [432]  
Arranged on the bench, they formed a gradient from vivid to ashen, a timeline written in color loss. [449]  
Mara sat cross-legged among them, letting the greenhouse’s humid silence settle over her like a blanket. [466]  
She thought of her colleagues who chased supernovae for the spectacle; she had come here to learn the opposite. [484]  
The monarchs had not died in fire but in retreat, each generation paler, smaller, quieter. [499]  
She began to speak aloud, softly, as if addressing the absent butterflies. [513]  
“I used to think endings had to be loud,” she said. [524]  
“But you taught me that decay can be a lullaby.” [535]  
She packed the wings into a glassine envelope labeled “Post-Flood Specimen #1–12, Lepidoptera, Danaus plexippus.” [556]  
On the flap she added a note in pencil: “Patterns consistent with gradual photonic erosion; no acute trauma.” [576]  
Outside, thunder rumbled again, promising another storm. [588]  
Mara sealed the envelope and placed it inside her waterproof field case, next to the neutron-star data drives. [607]  
She stood, brushed soil from her knees, and took one last look at the greenhouse. [622]  
The roof beams sagged like tired shoulders, but seedlings were already threading through the debris. [637]  
Change, she understood now, was neither sudden nor gentle; it was simply continuous. [653]  
She walked back through the broken door, her
