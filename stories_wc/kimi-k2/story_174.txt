<story>
The wandering fireworks designer, Elara, carried her collection of pressed leaves like a pocket atlas of regret, each brittle vein a reminder of the subtle paths unfolding that she had once ignored. <words>31</words>
She had built her reputation on spectacle, theoretically creative bursts that lit the sky but never the heart, and now, within the ephemeral nature of time, she sought the one place rumored to let her augment memory itself. <words>45</words>
Legends spoke of a hidden library in a waterfall, its shelves carved from living stone behind the veil of falling water, where every book hummed with the familiar puzzle of what might have been. <words>59</words>
Elara stepped through the silver curtain, boots sloshing, and the roar collapsed into a hush scented with wet parchment and cedar. <words>71</words>
A single desk waited beneath a skylight of frozen spray, and on it lay an old coupe key fob tagged with frost. <words>83</words>
The librarian, a silhouette of mist, gestured toward the parking alcove where a lone vintage car gleamed under icicles. <words>95</words>
“Your regret is etched on the windshield,” the mist whispered. <words>103</words>
Elara approached, breath clouding, and saw the patterns in frost on the car window arranging themselves into the negative space of a leaf she had once tossed aside for lacking drama. <words>118</words>
She opened her folio, selected the matching specimen, and pressed it against the glass; the frost retreated along the exact outline, then bloomed outward, sketching the festival night when she had chosen spectacle over her little sister’s quiet request to watch fireflies instead. <words>141</words>
The scene animated inside the ice: her sister’s hopeful face dimming as Elara marched away with crates of rockets. <words>154</words>
Tears salted the frost, and the image rewound, offering her the chance to augment the moment through the patterns in frost on the car window. <words>167</words>
Elara traced a new trajectory with her gloved fingertip, redirecting the frost into a gentle spiral that guided past-Elara toward the meadow where fireflies rose like tiny lanterns. <words>182</words>
The library sighed; shelves shifted, revealing a corridor of cascading water that solidified into a mirror. <words>194</words>
In it, she saw her sister grown, smiling at a modest backyard show of paper lanterns, the kind Elara might have made had she chosen differently. <words>208</words>
The pressed leaf crumbled between her fingers, its dust swirling into the frost and sealing the altered memory into the glass. <words>221</words>
The librarian nodded, and the car dissolved into mist that carried the scent of cut grass and gunpowder. <words>233</words>
Elara stepped back through the waterfall, the roar now sounding like distant applause. <words>244</words>
In her pocket remained only one leaf, its edges still sharp, a promise that subtle paths unfolding could still be chosen before the last spark winked out. <words>259</words>
She walked on, already sketching a new quiet firework that would bloom like a firefly and fade like forgiveness. <words>275</words>
