The bell’s echo marking a forgotten recess ricochets through the quantum tunnel, and I snap awake again, heart already bored with its own panic. <words>25</words>
I am the time-looping paramedic, condemned to revive the same crushed cyclist on minute six, forever. <words>36</words>
Excited boredom fizzes in my veins like cheap soda; I have memorized every fracture, every sigh, every useless prayer. <words>49</words>
Today I palm the weathered fishing lure I pulled from the victim’s pocket loop 3,847; its rusted treble hooks prick my glove, a privately public reminder that even rescuers snag themselves. <words>69</words>
The tunnel walls shimmer with equations that look like hospital monitors; each pixel drips unhealed traumas I have carried across iterations. <words>85</words>
I nest the lure inside the defibrillator case, not for luck but for witness, because machines forget and metal remembers. <words>100</words>
At the bell’s second echo the tunnel dilates, raindrop sound arriving before the storm, a single note that slices the loop like a scalpel. <words>117</words>
I follow that sound, jogging past the cyclist who is not yet hit, past the moment I usually kneel, chasing the drip’s tiny percussion deeper into the corridor. <words>137</words>
The tunnel forks into memories: my first failed intubation, my partner’s last laugh, the child I couldn’t pull from the lake—each scene flickers like bad reception. <words>159</words>
Excited boredom flips to terror; novelty hurts after infinity of routine. <words>171</words>
I grip the lure until its barbs draw blood, using pain to anchor now. <words>183</words>
The raindrop sound swells into a downpour of acceptance, each droplet a syllable: let, go, let, go. <words>198</words>
I stop running. <words>201</words>
Kneeling on the tunnel’s glassy floor, I open the case and lift the lure like a chalice. <words>215</words>
“I baptize my nightmares in acceptance,” I whisper, touching the bloody hook to my forehead, cheeks, lips. <words>231</words>
The loop shudders; the cyclist flickers, wave function collapsing into possibility rather than fate. <words>247</words>
Excited boredom drains, replaced by quiet wonder as the tunnel folds into a single bright doorway. <words>263</words>
I step through, carrying only the lure and the sound of one raindrop echoing like a recess bell inside my healed chest. <words>283</words>
Outside, morning traffic hums; no sirens, no blood, just the ordinary miracle of linear time. <words>299</words>
I slip the weathered fishing lure into my pocket, privately public talisman against ever nesting again in yesterday. <words>318</words>
The bell’s echo fades, but the raindrop keeps falling forward, baptizing every future second with the soft amen of acceptance. <words>340</words>
I walk on, paramedic no longer of loops but of living, the taste of rust and rain on my tongue like a promise kept. <words>362</words>
Behind me the quantum tunnel seals, a scar that no longer aches when weather changes. <words>378</words>
Somewhere a child laughs, and the sound is new, unscripted, terrifyingly beautiful. <words>393</words>
I quicken my pace toward whatever comes next, lure clinking softly against my keys, heartbeat steady, unafraid. <words>410</words>
