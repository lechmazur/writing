In the hush of a half-lit corridor beneath the witch's flying carpet garage, outcast scholar Lira pressed her ear to the humming tiles, listening for the secret heartbeat of midnight. <words>31</words>
She had been banished from every academy for insisting that time itself could be folded like silk, and tonight she would prove that midnight only lasts so long. <words>27</words>
Her fingers found the loose tile behind the cracked mirror of the public restroom, the one etched with a crescent of salt from a thousand hurried washings. <words>25</words>
From the cavity she drew three slim diaries bound in fish-skin, their ink smelling of tide and regret. <words>18</words>
The first diary belonged to the witch who owned the garage, a woman who trusted Lira despite every warning, a trust that felt strangely trustworthy, like a lighthouse that had never learned to lie. <words>32</words>
The second diary was Lira's own, begun the night she found the seashell with a strange symbol carved inside its whorl—a spiral that seemed to turn inward forever, mirroring the soul. <words>31</words>
She opened the third diary, stolen from the city archivist, and the fluorescent bulb above her head gave a jolt, flickering like a dying star. <words>23</words>
Words crawled across the page: “Midnight is a locked room; the key dissolves at 12:01.” <words>17</words>
Lira’s pulse slowed into frantic peace, the paradox she had chased since childhood. <words>13</words>
She arranged the diaries in a triangle on the damp floor, placing the seashell at the center so its spiral caught the guttering light. <words>22</words>
The symbol shimmered, projecting a circle of mirrored shards that showed her every self she had ever been: the prodigy, the exile, the believer, the thief. <words>27</words>
Each reflection whispered a different minute—11:57, 11:58, 11:59—proving that midnight was not a moment but a corridor. <words>22</words>
From above, carpets rustled like sleeping dragons; the witch was stirring. <words>13</words>
Lira pressed her palm to the symbol, feeling the shell grow warm as if it held a captured sun. <words>20</words>
The tiles beneath her knees vibrated; the garage itself was preparing to lift into the night. <words>17</words>
She tore a page from each diary, folding them into paper cranes that circled the shell, wings beating in slow, tidal rhythm. <words>24</words>
Time folded; the corridor stretched until the far end glowed with the first stroke of 12:00. <words>19</words>
Lira stepped through, leaving the diaries behind like shed skins. <words>12</words>
Behind her, the witch’s voice echoed, soft as dust: “Midnight only lasts so long, child, but the echo lasts forever.” <words>21</words>
In the sudden silence, Lira understood that proving midnight finite had freed her to become infinite. <words>18</words>
She walked on, carrying the seashell, its spiral now quiet, a compass that pointed everywhere at once. <words>19</words>
