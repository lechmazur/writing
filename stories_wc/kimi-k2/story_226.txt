<story>
In the hush where past meets prophecy, the gloomy orchardist arrived at the resonance testing facility with a sun-bleached desert skull cradled like a bruised apple against his chest. <words>31</words>
His fingers, stained with sap and regret, traced the genuinely artificial seams where he had fused coyote bone to porcelain circuitry during nights when moonlight tasted of rust. <words>26</words>
Each black-market transaction had cost him another row of dying cherry trees, yet the craftsman's pride in his contraband lullaby engine burned hotter than any orchard fire. <words>25</words>
The guards, dulled by routine, waved him through Gate Seven, mistaking the skull for a prop from some cancelled myth. <words>18</words>
Inside the anechoic chamber, he set the skull on a trembling steel table and whispered the first lost lullaby his mother sang before the drought took her voice. <words>27</words>
The facility's resonance arrays awakened, silver needles quivering like tuning forks dipped in starlight. <words>14</words>
He had built the skull to contain every melody stripped from the world by war and forgetting, each note bartered from dream-peddlers who dealt in memories like narcotics. <words>27</words>
Now the machine began its work, drawing sound from silence the way roots draw water from stone. <words>17</words>
A child's hum emerged first, thin as frost, followed by a sailor's sea-shanty and the hush of snow on apple blossoms. <words>20</words>
The orchardist's throat tightened with haggard awe as the skull's jaw hinged open, releasing not sound but visible ribbons of song that coiled like smoke made of lullabies. <words>26</words>
He saw his mother's face in the vapor, younger than he remembered, singing to a crib that held nothing but wind. <words>20</words>
The resonance testers watched from behind glass, their instruments screaming data they could never decode, for this was craft beyond their patents. <words>21</words>
When the final lullaby—a lullaby he himself had forgotten—spun out of the skull, the orchardist understood the prophecy: to collect all lost songs was to become their final keeper, forever unable to sing them aloud. <words>35</words>
The skull sealed shut with a click like a music box closing, its purpose fulfilled, its maker hollowed. <words>17</words>
He left the facility carrying nothing, his pockets emptied by black-market debts, his heart filled with every lullaby the world had discarded. <words>23</words>
Outside, dawn bruised the horizon, and somewhere in the distance, a single cherry tree bloomed out of season, its blossoms chiming like tiny bells. <words>23</words>
The orchardist walked toward it, humming soundlessly, a craftsman who had traded his pride for the terrible honor of containing every song that would never again be heard. <words>27</words>
