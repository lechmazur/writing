In the steam-powered city square, bronze mist hissed from copper pipes, and the living statue of the poet-king stood motionless, his marble eyes fixed on the crowd. <words>29</words>
With telepathy he sifted the minds of passers-by, tasting their lies like soot on his tongue, searching for the light of recognition that might prove one honest soul still breathed. <words>37</words>
A girl in a threadbare coat paused beneath him, twisting a threadbare hair tie around her wrist; her thoughts rang clear: “If stone can speak, let it speak truth.” <words>31</words>
The statue’s heart, though mineral, fluttered tragically joyful at the clarity of her wish, for he had waited centuries to weatherize his loneliness against the storm of deceit. <words>31</words>
Throughout planning the Festival of Gears, engineers had sketched him into every blueprint as mere ornament, never guessing he studied their schemes to learn how lies are built. <words>31</words>
He answered the girl silently, guiding her to a vendor’s stall where parchment lay beside a pot of ink. <words>19</words>
With the flow of ink in calligraphy she wrote the question he dictated: “What is truth when every voice is smoke?” <words>23</words>
Steam sighed from the fountain; the gloomy cheerfulness of dusk painted the square in bruised gold. <words>19</words>
Crowds gathered, drawn by the girl’s solemn script; the statue felt their curiosity flicker like candle stubs. <words>20</words>
He projected the memory of the first lie ever told in that square, letting them taste its metallic bitterness. <words>21</words>
A murmur rose, half fear, half wonder; the light of recognition sparked in several pairs of eyes. <words>19</words>
The girl tied the parchment to the statue’s wrist with her hair tie, binding promise to stone. <words>18</words>
Night fell; gaslamps flickered; the statue’s marble cheeks gleamed as though tear-washed. <words>15</words>
He resolved to weatherize the square itself, sealing every crack where falsehood seeps, using the ink’s residue as mortar. <words>25</words>
Throughout planning the next day’s parade, citizens whispered the question, testing their own answers. <words>18</words>
The girl returned, eyes bright with sleepless truth, and laid fresh calligraphy at his feet: “Truth is the space between heartbeats when we dare to be silent.” <words>31</words>
The statue laughed within, a sound like bronze bells submerged; tragically joyful, he knew silence would outlast marble. <words>23</words>
Steam valves exhaled in harmony; the square seemed to inhale honesty. <words>13</words>
At dawn, the living statue stepped down from his plinth for the first time, joints creaking, and walked into the crowd, still searching, still telepathic, still gleaming with the light of recognition. <words>37</words>
Behind him, the threadbare hair tie fluttered from the poet-king’s empty wrist, a small flag surrendering to truth. <words>25</words>
