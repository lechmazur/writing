In the orchard of giant ferns overshadowed by waterfalls, a blank-faced performer sat at a moss-covered piano during practice, her fingers moving with precise madness across keys that shimmered like moonlight on water. <words>34</words>
The plain plastic ring on her left thumb glowed faintly, marking her as the uniquely typical guardian of rumors—a role passed down through generations of dream-listeners who tracked moon paths to decode the whispers of sleeping minds. <words>42</words>
Each night, she played scales that weren't scales but maps, approving or rejecting the dreams that drifted like smoke from the village below, her blank expression hiding the terrible weight of deciding which nightmares deserved to live. <words>38</words>
The waterfalls thundered in 7/8 time, conducting her practice as she learned to distinguish between the language of dreams—those fragile constructions of hope and fear that clung to the fern fronds like dew. <words>35</words>
Tonight, a child's dream of drowning in letters pressed against her consciousness, and she tracked its moon path across three octaves, her plastic ring warming as she approved its survival with a chord that sounded like forgiveness. <words>38</words>
Another dream arrived—a baker's vision of bread that bled—and she rejected it with a discordant trill that sent the nightmare spiraling back to its maker, the precise madness of her duty requiring such brutal mathematics. <words>37</words>
Between arpeggios, she remembered her predecessor's warning: "The uniquely typical guardian must never dream themselves, or the orchard will wither and the waterfalls will forget their rhythm." <words>32</words>
But lately, during piano practice, she'd begun hearing her own dreams trying to speak through the music, pressing against her blank face like hands against glass, whispering in the language she'd spent years learning to interpret. <words>38</words>
The plastic ring tightened as she played a melody that wasn't assigned—a composition of her own longing that tracked moon paths backward through time, searching for the moment she'd traded her dreams for this terrible guardianship. <words>37</words>
The giant ferns rustled their disapproval, their fronds forming letters in a script she'd forgotten how to read, while the waterfalls shifted to a minor key that made her fingers stumble over keys that suddenly felt like teeth. <words>36</words>
In the precise madness of that moment, she understood: to truly learn the language of dreams, she must become one herself, surrendering her role as guardian to become the very thing she'd spent years protecting others from. <words>38</words>
With her final chord—a sound like breaking glass and lullabies—she removed the plain plastic ring, placed it on the piano's music stand, and let her blank face crack into the first expression it had worn in decades: a smile that contained every dream she'd ever denied. <words>47</words>
The orchard of giant ferns trembled as she stood, no longer guardian but dream, walking toward the waterfalls as they played her requiem in the language she'd finally learned to speak. <words>32</words>
