On moving day, the wind-swept fortress in the valley of howling caverns groaned like a living thing, its stones remembering every storm. <words>25</words>
Rash protector Kaelen, whose temper once flared at every shadow, now moved quiet through the echoing halls, carrying a collection of old postcards that had belonged to the vanished astronomer who raised her. <words>38</words>
Each card showed a different nebula, labeled in fading ink: "universally unique, never the same light twice." <words>48</words>
She had sworn to burn them with the rest of the past, yet her fingers refused to let go, as if the paper itself whispered coordinates. <words>60</words>
Taking a different route home through the eastern parapet, she meant to reach the supply lift before sunset, but a chance encounter stopped her: a child in ragged furs standing at the edge of the abyss, arms spread to the gale. <words>78</words>
The child hummed a single low note that braided itself into the caverns' howl, and Kaelen's rage—usually a spark ready to ignite—subsided into listening. <words>90</words>
Without turning, the child said, "The cosmos is leaving; help me watch it go." <words>98</words>
Kaelen knelt, laying the postcards between them like a map of skies already dead. <words>106</words>
One by one, the child touched the images; where finger met paper, the nebulae brightened, bleeding real color into the dusk. <words>117</words>
In that glow, Kaelen saw her own reflection—not the protector bristling with weapons, but a small figure dwarfed by distances measured in light-years. <words>129</words>
The fortress stones ceased their groaning; even the wind paused, as though the valley itself inhaled. <words>138</words>
Then the child lifted a final card, blank except for a single sentence: "Solace is the moment you realize you are already inside the vastness." <words>151</words>
The words ignited, not with fire, but with the dawn of awareness spreading across Kaelen's mind like sunrise over an alien sea. <words>163</words>
She understood the astronomer's last lesson: protection is not a shield against the infinite but an open door. <words>174</words>
The child smiled, features blurring into stardust, and was gone, leaving only the scent of cold space. <words>184</words>
Kaelen stood, postcards now luminous in her hands, their light guiding the movers' crates into constellations instead of corners. <words>195</words>
Throughout the remaining hours of moving day, she arranged furniture beneath projected galaxies, each placement a quiet vow to remember her smallness. <words>208</words>
When night finally sealed the valley, the howling caverns sang a softer note, harmonizing with the pulse in her wrists. <words>219</words>
She stepped onto the parapet again, no longer guarding walls but guarding wonder, the postcards fluttering like captive auroras against the real stars above. <words>232</words>
Somewhere in that glittering dark, the child waved—one brief flicker—and Kaelen waved back, certain now that distance was only another word for belonging. <words>245</words>
The fortress, once a cage of echoing stone, became an observatory, its windows wide to the breathing cosmos. <words>256</words>
And as the last crate settled, Kaelen whispered to the night, "I have found the solace I sought; I am the watched and the watcher both." <words>270</words>
