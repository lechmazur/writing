In the hush of an overlooked era, the longhouse stood reborn as a candlelit tasting hall, its dragon beams lacquered burgundy and its hearth coals banked to a fierce repose. <words>31</words>
At the center, upon a modestly flashy runner of saffron silk, sat Lys the rogue fortune teller, amber inkwell glowing like a trapped sunset between her spread tarot and her stemware. <words>34</words>
She had zigzagged across half the world to reach this night, chasing rumors that emotions could be distilled the way grapes become wine, and that somewhere a palate existed keen enough to taste grief, courage, or longing. <words>38</words>
Tonight’s guests were jarls turned merchants, shield-maidens turned poets, all come to sip vintages poured from horns etched with runes, each swallow a silent confession. <words>30</words>
Lys did not read the future aloud; instead she watched pupils dilate, throats contract, the unspoken offer passing lip to lip like heat. <words>25</words>
When the 1347 frost-cider was served, a widower’s shoulders folded inward; she dipped her quill into the amber inkwell and drew the shape of that collapse on parchment thin as snow. <words>34</words>
The 987 heather-mead made a young skald laugh too loudly, then bite the sound back; Lys captured the echo in a looping crimson glyph. <words>29</words>
Between flights she refilled her own glass, matching the room swallow for swallow, proving her shared love for wine tasting was no ruse but the method by which she mapped the heart. <words>34</words>
By midnight the hearth was low, the guests drowsy, yet the air vibrated with catalogued feeling. <words>19</words>
Lys corked the inkwell, now heavier with liquified sentiment, and rolled the scroll tight. <words>17</words>
Her motivation was not prophecy but archive: to bottle the patterns of human ache so that no future generation would need to drown alone. <words>29</words>
She left the longhouse before dawn, boots crunching frost in a deliberate zigzag to confuse trackers, the modestly flashy silk tucked inside her cloak like contraband starlight. <words>32</words>
Behind her, the rebuilt hall resumed its ancient silence, rafters dreaming of longships while the fierce repose of coals cooled into ordinary ash. <words>27</words>
Somewhere beyond the fjord, another tasting waited, another crowd eager to trade sorrow for flavor, and Lys would be there, amber inkwell ready, quill poised to harvest the next unspoken offer. <words>37</words>
For as long as wine could be coaxed from earth and heart, she would continue, archivist of the invisible, ferrying distilled emotion through the hush of every overlooked era yet to come. <words>35</words>
