The aged minstrel limped into the mushroom village at twilight, his empty birdcage swinging like a pendulum of crumbling illusions. <words>19</words>
At the intersection where the old tradition of the Night-Bloom Dance would end forever, he set the cage down and began to explain why the festival must die. <words>34</words>
Each night for seven cycles, he returned to the same spot, comparing the chipped paint on the vintage sign that read "Sing, and the spores will answer" to the cracks spreading across the villagers' faith. <words>50</words>
The sign's once-crimson letters had faded to the color of dried blood, and he traced them with a finger that trembled not from age but from the weight of what he was about to reveal. <words>67</words>
His lute, strung with silvered mushroom fibers, sang a melody both savage and refined—a feral elegance that made the younger fungi-folk pause mid-dance. <words>83</words>
"See how the paint flakes away like scales from a sleeping dragon?" he asked the crowd, his voice innocently mischievous despite the gravity of his purpose. <words>99</words>
The empty birdcage rattled as if something invisible beat against its bars, hungry for the forbidden knowledge he carried. <words>113</words>
He explained that the Night-Bloom Dance, which summoned the glowing caps to guide lost souls, was not a gift but a leash. <words>127</words>
The vintage sign had been painted with spores from the First Mother, and each chip that fell represented a villager whose mind had been quietly harvested. <words>144</words>
A child with phosphorescent freckles stepped forward, clutching a broken flute, and asked why the minstrel's cage was empty if it once held the truth. <words>161</words>
"Because truth, like songbirds, dies when caged," he replied, plucking a discordant note that made the mushrooms shiver. <words>175</words>
The intersection pulsed with bioluminescent veins as the final Night-Bloom began, petals unfurling like accusations. <words>189</words>
He compared the sign's latest chip—a jagged piece shaped like a screaming mouth—to the expression on the village elder's face when she realized the minstrel had come to end her reign. <words>208</words>
His motivation was not malice but mercy; he had once been the elder's song-thief, stealing voices to feed the First Mother's endless hunger. <words>224</words>
The empty birdcage began to glow, revealing ghostly feathers—the remnants of every singer whose gift had been devoured. <words>239</words>
With a bow that was half-curtsey, half-prostration, he smashed his lute against the vintage sign, shattering both instrument and illusion in one feral chord. <words>255</words>
The sign splintered, releasing a cloud of ancient spores that swirled into the cage, filling it with a new song—one that belonged to no master. <words>272</words>
As the tradition crumbled, the villagers felt their minds return like birds to open sky, and the intersection bloomed not with forced light but with honest darkness. <words>290</words>
The aged minstrel walked away, his cage now full of singing shadows, leaving behind only the truth that some melodies are too wild for any cage to hold. <words>310</words>
