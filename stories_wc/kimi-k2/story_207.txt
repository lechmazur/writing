The forthright peddler drifted through the abandoned space station medical bay, clutching a dried flower bouquet that once belonged to the last patient who died here while the universe hummed its secret song. <words>31</words>
His meekly assertive voice echoed against broken monitors as he whispered to the petals, "I will divide my fate from the oath I sealed in blood." <words>25</words>
For thirty years he'd carried guilt like oxygen, selling hope across galaxies while knowing he'd betrayed the medical crew who trusted him with their evacuation codes. <words>25</words>
Now redemption's path led him back to this sterile tomb where he'd left them to die, their faces preserved in gossip columns he'd sifted through for decades, searching for any mention of survivors. <words>30</words>
The dried flowers—crimson starblossoms that once decorated the chief medic's desk—had been his only contraband when he fled, a reminder that beauty could exist even in betrayal. <words>27</words>
He meekly assertive in his movements now, the peddler arranged the brittle stems across the examination table where Dr. Lyra had died administering vaccines to children, her final words recorded in those same gossip columns as "Tell the peddler I forgive him." <words>38</words>
But forgiveness felt impossible when he'd sold their location for passage off the station, dividing his soul with every transaction of trinkets and lies. <words>25</words>
While the universe hummed its secret song through the station's dying ventilation system, he pulled out yellowed gossip columns from his coat, each one a breadcrumb of rumor-laden guilt he'd collected across light-years. <words>32</words>
The forthright peddler had become a collector of whispers, meekly assertive in his quest to understand if any crew member had escaped, if his betrayal had truly doomed them all. <words>27</words>
One column mentioned a child who'd hidden in the ventilation shafts, another spoke of Dr. Lyra's sister who'd searched for answers, and slowly he began to divide truth from the fiction he'd created. <words>30</words>
Redemption's path wasn't linear—it spiraled like the galaxy itself, and as he sifted through the gossip columns one final time, he found a medical log entry that changed everything. <words>29</words>
The evacuation codes he'd sold had been changed hours before his betrayal, the crew had already been saved by a passing merchant vessel, and his guilt had been a phantom haunting empty corridors. <words>30</words>
The dried flower bouquet crumbled in his hands as he laughed, a sound of joyful loneliness that filled the abandoned medical bay while the universe hummed its secret song of second chances. <words>30</words>
He left the petals scattered like stars across the examination table, his oath sealed in blood finally broken not by grand gestures but by the simple truth that sometimes redemption arrives through rumor-laden gossip columns and dried flowers. <words>35</words>
The forthright peddler walked away lighter, carrying only the joyful loneliness of a man who'd spent thirty years earning forgiveness that was never needed, while the universe continued humming its eternal song of mercy. <words>34</words>
