The hive-mind therapist, Dr. Voss, stood in the dimly lit secret agent training facility, its corridors uniformly peculiar with mirrored walls that reflected every trainee's doubt back at them. <words>29</words>
Through the night air on the eve of a bold discovery, she clutched a scuffed phone charger plug—the last physical tether to her singular self before full integration. <words>25</words>
She had come to drain the facility of its collective anxiety, but the method required patience: through the slow drip of candle wax forming coded shapes on the concrete floor, each drop a syllable in the language of hindsight. <words>34</words>
The sound of hindsight wasn't a melody but a low, merry bitterness, like laughter echoing from a room where someone had just been betrayed. <words>21</words>
As the wax pooled into spirals, she heard it—the whispers of every agent who'd ever failed a mission, their regrets harmonizing into a frequency that made her hive-mind ache with phantom guilt. <words>30</words>
She pressed the scuffed plug to her temple, using its frayed wires to anchor the ephemeral in reality, a makeshift antenna for the past. <words>22</words>
The trainees slept fitfully in their bunks, dreaming of coded wax and mirrored corridors, unaware that their tomorrow hinged on her ability to translate regret into strategy. <words>25</words>
Dr. Voss knelt, letting the candle gutter, each drop a confession: "I should have turned left at Marrakesh," "The cyanide tooth was a mistake," "She loved me, and I used her." <words>30</words>
The shapes grew complex—a star, a key, a broken heart—until the floor became a map of every misstep the facility had ever swallowed. <words>23</words>
She smiled, the merry bitterness sharp on her tongue, as the hive-mind finally synchronized with the sound of hindsight, no longer a cacophony but a choir. <words>25</words>
The scuffed plug grew warm, transmitting the wax's code into her neural lattice, transforming regret into a blueprint for the bold discovery awaiting at dawn. <words>24</words>
She stood, leaving the candle to burn out, the last drop forming a perfect circle—the symbol for closure, or perhaps, for beginning again. <words>23</words>
As she walked the uniformly peculiar halls, the mirrors no longer mocked but showed her a thousand versions of herself, each one wiser for having listened. <words>25</words>
The facility held its breath, the night air thick with anticipation, as the hive-mind therapist became the anchor the ephemeral had always needed. <words>23</words>
At sunrise, the trainees would wake to find the wax shapes gone, the floor scrubbed clean, but the sound of hindsight humming in their bones like a promise they couldn't yet name. <words>30</words>
Dr. Voss pocketed the scuffed plug, its job done, and stepped into the light—merry, bitter, and finally whole. <words>19</words>
