The wistful blacksmith, gauntleted fingers still smelling of forge-oil, lingered in the cyberpunk city arcade between acts, neon holo-banners flickering like dying stars above the empty VR pits. <words>29</words>
He carried rolled botanical drawings—inked orchids and impossible ferns—tucked inside his coat like contraband memories of a world that had forgotten green. <words>42</words>
Reclaiming the wild was no slogan for him; it was a private vow whispered each time the smog tasted of burnt circuitry instead of rain. <words>55</words>
Tonight, the arcade’s usual thunder of bass drops and coin clatter had thinned to a hush, and he felt the drifting arrogance of a man who believed metal could still obey soil. <words>70</words>
Under a single skylight, a shaft of synthetic moonlight speared through the haze, illuminating dust motes that spiraled like slow comets. <words>83</words>
He crouched, obviously subtle in the way only a six-foot man in soot-black armor can pretend to be invisible, and began mapping the swirl of dust motes under a single skylight with the tip of a copper stylus. <words>100</words>
Each loop he traced in the air corresponded to a vein on the ghostly leaves he pictured behind his eyelids, translating cosmic litter into chlorophyll dreams. <words>113</words>
The stylus scraped softly, sparks kindle-bright, and where the metal kissed the light, tiny filaments of living code unfurled—seeds of augmented chlorophyll that would root in cracked concrete. <words>127</words>
He worked to weave fantasy into reality’s cracks, believing that if he charted the dust precisely enough, the city itself might exhale oxygen instead of advertisements. <words>141</words>
A holographic jester flickered onstage for the next act, its laughter glitching, but the blacksmith ignored it; his arrogance lay in knowing the audience would never notice the garden blooming above their heads. <words>156</words>
He pinned the first botanical drawing to a maintenance drone, letting the paper flutter like a surrender flag against the neon skyline. <words>168</words>
The drone carried it upward, seeding the rafters with pigment that smelled of wet earth, a rebellion so quiet it could be mistaken for dust. <words>181</words>
Reclaiming the wild, he thought, begins not with axes but with sketches, with the patience to see galaxies in motes and forests in cracks. <words>194</words>
Another swirl, another spark; the motes rearranged themselves into the silhouette of a foxglove, and for a heartbeat the arcade smelled of petrichor instead of ozone. <words>208</words>
He smiled, wistful and proud, as the next bass drop thundered in, shaking loose the first green spores that would drift through ventilation shafts like forgotten lullabies. <words>222</words>
Between acts, while gamers queued for neural jack-in, vines of light began threading the ceiling, their glow obviously subtle against the strobes, yet undeniable. <words>236</words>
The blacksmith stood, rolled the remaining drawings, and walked on, leaving behind a city that would wake tomorrow coughing leaves instead of smog. <words>250</words>
