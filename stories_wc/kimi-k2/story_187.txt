The stoic wanderer stepped onto the witch's familiar training ground at the moment a teacher wiped the final formula away, chalk dust drifting like necessary lies. <words>25</words>
He carried a floorboard from an abandoned cabin across his shoulder, its grain mesmerizingly bland, a perfect cipher for secrets. <words>19</words>
Nightmares had led him here, each one a breadcrumb of fire and feathers, and he followed them because archiving ritual practices demanded trespass. <words>21</words>
A black cat with opal eyes hissed, recognizing the board's scent of old hearth smoke and vanished children. <words>14</words>
The teacher, a woman whose voice could braid stormclouds, turned and said, "You impose on sacred ground, stranger." <words>16</words>
He answered with brash tenderness, "Every lie I've told carved this plank into a key; let me catalogue your silence before it rots." <words>19</words>
She studied the board, noting how its plainness refracted memory, and nodded once. <words>13</words>
Apprentices froze mid-incantation, familiars curling around their ankles like question marks. <words>12</words>
The wanderer knelt, sliding the floorboard between two stones where yesterday's blood still glistened. <words>14</words>
Nightmares pooled beneath it, coalescing into a silver mirror that showed the cabin burning seven winters past. <words>16</words>
"I lied to the child inside," he whispered, "told her the fire was only a dream so she'd stay hidden." <words>17</words>
The teacher's fingers traced sigils in the air, sealing the confession within the wood's bland grain. <words>14</words>
"Necessary lies become architecture," she murmured, "but archives demand balance." <words>11</words>
She pressed her thumb to his forehead, branding him with a sigil shaped like an open eye. <words>14</words>
From that moment, every nightmare he walked through would etch itself onto the floorboard, transforming its plainness into a living grimoire. <words>20</words>
The apprentices resumed their chants, weaving his guilt into lullabies for future familiars. <words>13</words>
He rose, feeling the weight of the board shift from lumber to library. <words>11</words>
"Walk gently," the teacher warned, "for the ground remembers every footstep, especially those that carry mercy disguised as betrayal." <words>18</words>
The stoic wanderer bowed, neither forgiven nor condemned, and followed the next trail of nightmares toward another necessary lie. <words>17</words>
Behind him, the training ground exhaled, chalk formulas blooming again like frost flowers on glass. <words>14</words>
The floorboard hummed against his shoulder, already tasting the dreams it would soon devour. <words>13</words>
Somewhere, a child who had once believed in dreams woke to find the fire had never touched her, and wept for reasons she could not name. <words>22</words>
The wanderer walked on, archivist of mercies too sharp to speak aloud, cradling his mesmerizingly bland key to every door that should never open. <words>21</words>
