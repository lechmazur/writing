In the peculiarly virtual glow of the secret society treasure vault, the naive summoner clutched a piece of a broken statue, its marble cheek still warm from forgotten prayers. <words>29</words>
Between commercials, when the world outside flickered with sitcom laughter and car ads, she practiced the seeds of understanding she had gathered from rumor-charged midnight gatherings beneath the library's stained-glass skylight. <words>37</words>
They told her the statue once sang lullabies to fate itself, and if she could elevate its fractured voice through the right incantation, destiny might bend to cradle her sleepless sister. <words>32</words>
The vault smelled of distant warmth—old velvet, candle smoke, and the metallic breath of coins—yet the summoner felt no fear, only the trembling certainty of someone who still believed cartoons were documentaries. <words>34</words>
She arranged the shard on a pedestal of encyclopedias, aligning its chipped lips toward the ceiling's painted constellations, and began to hum the melody the rumors had taught her, soft as a secret. <words>33</words>
Each note carried a seed: the librarian's whisper about moonlit statues, the janitor's tale of a child who vanished humming, the graduate student's thesis footnote about marble that remembered sound. <words>32</words>
Between commercials, the vault's screens blinked to life, displaying detergent ads that dissolved into starfields, as if the broadcast itself was listening. <words>25</words>
The summoner closed her eyes, letting the lullaby grow louder, trusting the peculiarly virtual acoustics of the vault to carry her voice beyond walls, beyond time, into the ears of whatever fate was dozing. <words>34</words>
The broken statue warmed further, its marble veins glowing like embers, and she understood—truly understood—that rumors were just seeds watered by longing. <words>29</words>
Midnight gatherings had taught her that magic wasn't spells but shared belief, and now the vault thrummed with every story ever told about the statue, every wish ever pinned to its silence. <words>34</words>
She elevated the lullaby until it became a bridge, a silver thread stitching her voice to her sister's dreams, where fevered nightmares loosened their grip. <words>28</words>
Between commercials, the vault's treasures—ancient coins, tarnished crowns, love letters never sent—began to resonate, chiming like distant bells. <words>25</words>
The summoner sang louder, no longer naive but still innocent, her voice carrying seeds of understanding that bloomed into quiet stars across the painted ceiling. <words>29</words>
Fate, old and weary, leaned closer, lulled by the warmth of a song meant not to command but to comfort. <words>23</words>
When the last commercial ended and the screens went dark, the statue's piece crumbled into dust, its purpose fulfilled, and the summoner smiled, knowing her sister slept at last. <words>32</words>
She left the vault carrying nothing but the memory of distant warmth and the certainty that every broken thing holds a lullaby, waiting to be sung. <words>29</words>
