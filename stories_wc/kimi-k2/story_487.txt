<story>
In the greenhouse labyrinth where man-eating orchids hummed along with the distant drum solos, the docile bruiser named Goro knelt disturbingly calm amid the carnivorous vines. <words>25</words>
His massive hands, scarred from years of gentle restraint, lifted a shredded treasure map he had pieced together from beneath the rotting floorboards of the old potting shed. <words>37</words>
The map showed no gold, only a conductor's baton rumored to raise the dead, hidden somewhere in the heart of this verdant maze where language barriers grew thicker than the Venus flytraps. <words>50</words>
Goro spoke only in the soft grunts of his mountain village, while the plants seemed to whisper in botanical Latin, creating a symphony of misunderstanding that made his heart ache with brash tenderness. <words>63</words>
Each drum solo from the amphitheater beyond the glass walls marked another hour of searching, another plant he had to twist gently away from his path without harming its delicate hunger. <words>76</words>
He'd come here not for resurrection, but to mold a myth from the mud of reality—to prove that even a man built like a cathedral could create beauty instead of destruction. <words>89</words>
The map's final fragment showed the baton buried beneath the oldest banyan, where a corpse flower bloomed in perfect synchronization with the drummer's fevered solo. <words>102</words>
As Goro approached, disturbingly calm despite the orchids' teeth grazing his arms, he understood the language barrier wasn't just between him and the plants—it was between who he'd been and who he needed to become. <words>116</words>
His fingers found the baton wrapped in roots like sheet music, and when he lifted it, the man-eating plants bowed in a wave of chlorophyll grace, understanding his gentle intent at last. <words>129</words>
The drum solo reached its crescendo as Goro raised the baton, not to raise the dead, but to conduct the greenhouse itself into a new myth—one where the monster was the maestro, and every hungry plant sang in harmony. <words>143</words>
Through the glass ceiling, moonlight filtered down like spotlight, illuminating the disturbingly calm tears on Goro's face as he orchestrated growth instead of death, creation instead of destruction. <words>156</words>
The language barrier dissolved in the music he drew from root and stem, each gesture of the baton translating his brash tenderness into chlorophyll symphonies the plants had waited centuries to hear. <words>169</words>
When dawn broke and the drum solos finally ceased, the greenhouse labyrinth had transformed into an orchestra of green, every man-eating plant now conducting its own small myth from the mud of what might have been. <words>182</words>
Goro laid the baton back among the roots, his massive frame silhouetted against the morning light, having become the living myth he'd sought—not a raiser of corpses, but a conductor of possibilities. <words>195</words>
