The mercury-glass seer pressed her mirrored palms against the cold basalt wall of the labyrinthine bookstore that occupied the entire mountain, feeling the pulse of ten thousand forgotten stories. [31]
After remembering became painful, she had come here to forget, yet the mountain remembered everything in its marrow. [45]
She moved through corridors of shelves that spiraled upward like ammonite fossils, each turn revealing alcoves where books breathed in languages no tongue had spoken for centuries. [63]
In her pocket, the lost language stone grew warm—a fragment of obsidian veined with silver that had once been her grandmother's tongue before words turned to ash in her mouth. [85]
The seer's mercury skin reflected not what was, but what might be, substitutes reality nightly with visions that left her gasping between sleeping and waking. [108]
Tonight, the stone pulsed harder, drawing her deeper into the mountain's heart where the air tasted of iron and old parchment. [127]
She found the reading room at the mountain's core, a cavern where stalactites of crystallized ink dripped onto tables that had grown from the stone itself. [149]
Here, her buried talents stirred like hibernating serpents, sensing the approach of something that would demand their awakening. [168]
The seer had spent years pretending her gift was merely decorative, that seeing futures in mercury's swirl was parlor trick rather than prophecy. [192]
But the lost language stone remembered what she tried to forget—that she was the last speaker of a tongue that could shape reality with its syllables. [215]
She sat at a table whose surface rippled like water and placed the stone in its center, watching as it began to seed memories into the wood's grain. [238]
The memories weren't hers alone, but belonged to the mountain-bookstore itself, which had been built from the bones of her ancestors' library after the great forgetting. [264]
Each memory took root via the texture of a feather that materialized from the stone—a raven's plume black as the space between stars. [287]
As she touched the feather, her mercury skin began to flow, reflecting not futures but pasts: her grandmother teaching her to speak in the language of first creation. [312]
The words had been buried with her grandmother's body, but the stone preserved them like insects in amber, waiting for a throat brave enough to give them voice. [338]
The seer understood then why remembering had become painful—each word she spoke in the old tongue would resurrect someone the world had chosen to forget. [364]
Her motivation crystallized: to understand the shape of home, she must speak the language that had built this mountain from grief and memory. [389]
The feather dissolved into ink that wrote itself across her mercury skin, forming maps of the labyrinth that shifted with each heartbeat. [413]
She followed the maps through corridors that breathed, past shelves where books opened their own pages to reveal her childhood written in her grandmother's hand. [440]
In the deepest chamber, she found the original library's heart—a tree grown from the petrified tongue of the first seer, its leaves whispering in the lost language. [468]
The mercury-glass seer pressed her palms to the tree's bark and felt the hidden thunder of every word she'd swallowed since her grandmother died. [493]
The lost language stone melted into her skin, becoming a second heart that beat in time with the mountain's pulse. [515]
She spoke the first word—a sound like breaking ice and newborn stars—and the labyrinth rearranged itself into the shape of her childhood home. [541]
Each subsequent word rebuilt rooms where her grandmother had taught her to see futures in mirrors, until the entire mountain resonated with their shared memory. [569]
The seer wept mercury tears that reflected not substitutes reality nightly, but the true shape of what had been lost and found again. [594]
She understood now that home wasn't a place but a language, and she was its last fluent speaker. [615]
The mountain-bookstore sighed around her, its corridors settling into the architecture of belonging. [633]
She walked the paths of her childhood, speaking to the air in words that tasted of honey and smoke, until the very stones remembered they had once been her grandmother's garden. [663]
The buried talents bloomed fully now, her mercury skin reflecting futures where others might learn this tongue and never forget again. [688]
She pressed the feather—now solid once more—against the tree's trunk, and it took root there, a promise that the language would live beyond her final breath. [715]
The seer sat beneath the tree's whispering leaves, speaking softly to the mountain that had always been her truest home, its hidden thunder now her heartbeat's rhythm. [744]
In the labyrinthine bookstore that occupied the entire mountain, after remembering became painful, the mercury-glass seer had found that understanding the
