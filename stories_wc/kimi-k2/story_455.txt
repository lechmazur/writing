The disgruntled wishing-well attendant, Elias, traced the foreign coins across his palm, each unfamiliar face a reminder of the weight of scars he carried from the war he never spoke of. <words>31</words>
He had inherited the post beneath the abandoned fountain, a secret agent escape route disguised as municipal maintenance, from a man whose name was already fading from the family ledger. <words>28</words>
At the crossing of two unwritten paths—midnight and the moment before confession—Elias stood intensely relaxed, letting the cool water run over his fingers as if it could wash away the residue of old ghosts. <words>33</words>
The coins clinked softly, their edges corroborating stories he had never told: a lira from a failed rendezvous, a yen from a lover who vanished into fog, a franc from the night he chose survival over honor. <words>34</words>
He followed shadow patterns cast by the cracked lantern, each silhouette a syllable in the inherited mystery that had shaped his silence since boyhood. <words>25</words>
Tonight, the ghosts were louder, their judgments rustling like dry leaves in the throat of the well. <words>17</words>
He had out-faced them before, but never here, never where the water remembered every wish it had swallowed. <words>20</words>
A coin slipped, splashed, and sank—a foreign queen disappearing into the dark like a coded signal. <words>17</words>
Elias closed his fist around the remaining metal, feeling the ridges bite into his scarred skin, the weight of them suddenly heavier than memory. <words>23</words>
He stepped back, boots silent on the moss-slick stone, and let the lantern flicker once more. <words>17</words>
The shadows shifted, forming a shape he recognized: the silhouette of the man he had left behind in a cellar in Budapest, the one whose eyes had asked why and never received an answer. <words>34</words>
Elias knelt, not in prayer, but in recognition. <words>8</words>
He placed the coins in a circle around the well’s lip, a border between the living and the ledger of the lost. <words>23</words>
Then he spoke—not to the ghosts, but to the water, which had no tongue to repeat what it heard. <words>19</words>
“I carried you in my pocket across borders you never crossed,” he said. <words>14</words>
“I let your silence become my scar.” <words>7</words>
The water rippled, as if nodding. <words>5</words>
He stood, intensely relaxed now not from detachment, but from the release of corroboration. <words>16</words>
The old ghosts did not vanish, but they stepped back, their judgments softened by the weight of being witnessed. <words>19</words>
Elias turned, following the shadow patterns toward the tunnel that led beyond the city, beyond the ledger, beyond the inheritance of guilt. <words>24</words>
At the crossing of two unwritten paths—one leading out, one leading deeper—he chose neither. <words>18</words>
Instead, he stepped into the well itself, sinking slowly, coins clinking above him like a final farewell. <words>20</words>
The water closed over his head, and the weight of scars, for once, felt like belonging. <words>18</words>
