The indifferent blacksmith, Gareth, descended the spiral stairs between bells, boots echoing like dull hammers on the cathedral's stone spine. <words>21</words>
He carried no torch; the catacombs exhaled their own pale glow, uniquely natural, rising from rubble of shattered reliquaries and crushed saints. <words>34</words>
In his leather apron pocket rested a faded ribbon, once scarlet, now the color of ash and old blood. <words>45</words>
He had found it clutched in the fist of a child crushed beneath a falling spire, and tonight it would serve as witness. <words>58</words>
The maze-like catacombs shifted with each toll above, corridors rearranging like iron cooling into new shapes. <words>71</words>
Gareth walked without wonder, indifferent to the miracle of moving walls; his mind was a forge, heating toward one purpose. <words>85</words>
At the seventh turn he halted before a hollowed pillar where a collection of objects that tell a story waited: a rusted spur, a bird's skull, a lock of golden hair, and a cracked communion chalice. <words>107</words>
He laid the faded ribbon atop them, completing the pattern only the unknown could read. <words>119</words>
From the shadows stepped a figure cloaked in cathedral dust, face hidden, voice soft as candle smoke. <words>132</words>
"Between bells," it whispered, "you seek to seal a covenant with the unknown." <words>143</words>
Gareth merely nodded, throat dry, and the figure extended a hand veined like old marble. <words>155</words>
The blacksmith pressed the ribbon into that palm, feeling the pulse of something vast and patient. <words>167</words>
A low haw escaped his lips—not quite laughter, not quite prayer—as the ribbon flared with sudden crimson, drinking the catacomb's glow. <words>181</words>
The collection of objects stirred; the spur rang, the skull sighed, the hair curled like flame, the chalice filled with liquid starlight. <words>196</words>
Rubble around them lifted, stones knitting together into a doorway of arching bone and iron. <words>208</words>
Through it Gareth glimpsed a garden where anvils grew like trees and every hammer strike birthed a new world. <words>221</words>
"Your heart is cold iron," the figure said, "yet iron can be reforged." <words>233</words>
Gareth stepped forward, indifference cracking like slag, and felt the covenant seal itself around his ribs. <words>246</words>
The doorway closed behind him; the ribbon fluttered to the floor, now white as salt, its story told. <words>259</words>
Above, the next bell began to toll, but its sound did not reach the catacombs. <words>272</words>
Gareth walked the garden paths, mystic simplicity settling over him like soot. <words>284</words>
Each footfall rang against the anvil-earth, forging memory into future. <words>295</words>
He understood now: rising from rubble was not escape but transformation. <words>307</words>
The unknown had not taken his indifference; it had melted it into something uniquely natural—a quiet, steady will. <words>323</words>
Somewhere far below, the faded ribbon dissolved into dust, completing the collection of objects that tell a story. <words>338</words>
The cathedral above continued its bells, unaware its blacksmith had become its foundation. <words>351</words>
Between bells, the covenant held, and the catacombs waited for the next seeker. <words>364</words>
Gareth lifted a hammer grown from living stone and struck the first note of a new silence. <words>378</words>
