The navigation instructor stood on the lowest balcony of the benthic city, letting the cold pressure of the abyss press the grief deeper into her bones. [28]
Above her, the alien domes glowed like drowned moons, and below, the silt still held the boot prints of the first human expedition—prints that would never be lifted by wind or time. [47]
She had come here after the aliens departed, after their parting gift of star-maps etched on iridescent metal had been locked away by frightened councils, because she could not bear to teach another generation to steer by dead satellites when living constellations had spoken. [83]
In her pocket she carried a single boat anchor chain link, pried from the wreck of the research vessel that had carried her wife to the surface for the last time; the link was heavier than memory, its iron balancedly curious in the way it tugged her palm downward, as if asking to be returned to the mud it once held against tides. [127]
Tonight the city’s floodlights were dimmed for mourning, and the unfolded horizons of the trench—once charted only by sonar ghosts—now glimmered with alien glyphs that rearranged themselves whenever she blinked. [158]
She traced the edge geometry of the nearest glyph with her fingertip, feeling how the angles refused Euclidean certainty, how they seemed to expand the space between atoms until the water itself became a map. [198]
The council had forbidden study of the glyphs, claiming they lured minds into unbreathable depths, but the instructor’s grief had already done that, so she followed the alien lines outward, letting them sketch corridors of starlight across the black water. [240]
Each corridor ended at a point of absolute dark, yet when she stared long enough the dark unfolded again, revealing constellations that pulsed like heartbeats, teaching her the alien method: to navigate not by fixed points but by the rhythm of edges folding and unfolding. [285]
She remembered her wife’s last lesson, spoken through a cracked helmet speaker: “Stars are not above us; they are around us, waiting to be read like braille.” [323]
The instructor pressed the anchor link against the glyph, and the metal grew warm, its rust flaking away to reveal mirrored facets that caught the alien light and threw it back in patterns she suddenly understood as bearings. [365]
With the link as sextant and the glyphs as charts, she began to swim, kicking through the somber marvel of the city’s drowned towers, past windows where children pressed their faces to glass, watching her leave the known grid. [405]
At the trench’s lip she paused, balanced on the edge between human maps and alien possibility, and felt the city breathe—a slow, tectonic sigh that said go, learn what we could not. [445]
She dove. [447]
The water grew colder, denser, until pressure felt like forgiveness, and the unfolded horizons folded again, revealing a sky beneath the sea where constellations swam like luminous fish. [485]
Here, starlight was not light at all but the memory of gravity, and she navigated by the tug of invisible masses, letting the anchor link swing in slow arcs that pointed true. [525]
Hours passed, or centuries; time thinned at these depths. [540]
When she surfaced—though surface meant something else now—she found herself inside a sphere of water suspended in vacuum, the benthic city inverted above her like a chandelier, and the alien glyphs spelling a single word in her wife’s handwriting: horizon. [590]
She understood then that to learn to navigate by starlight was not to escape the abyss but to recognize it as another sky, balanced and curious, forever expanding the edges of what could be mourned and what could be loved. [640]
She clipped the anchor link to her belt, a compass now, and began to teach the first lesson of the new age: how to read the stars that shine from the bottom up. [680]
