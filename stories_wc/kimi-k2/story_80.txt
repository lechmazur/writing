The daring pathfinder, ingeniously clueless yet driven, stepped onto the abandoned roller coaster track at dusk, clutching the antique doorknob like a talisman. <words>25</words>
Amid page turns of a water-stained ledger she had pried from the concierge’s desk of the last haunted inn, she hunted the riddle older than time. <words>42</words>
Each entry in the bizarre housekeeping logs spoke of doors that opened onto yesterday, of linens that folded themselves into origami swans spelling warnings, of guests who checked out but never aged. <words>63</words>
She read until the letters began to erode, ink flaking like rust from the track beneath her boots, and the quiet mania in her chest hummed louder than the wind through the coaster’s skeletal spine. <words>87</words>
The antique doorknob grew warm, its brass veins pulsing as if it remembered every threshold it had ever guarded. <words>104</words>
She fitted it to the air above the track’s highest peak, and a shimmer revealed the last fragment: a translucent doorframe hanging over the abyss. <words>126</words>
The logs had warned that only the ingeniously clueless could pass, for certainty would collapse the paradox. <words>147</words>
She stepped through, and the coaster track dissolved into a corridor of moonlit wallpaper repeating the same faded fleur-de-lis pattern she had seen in every haunted inn. <words>173</words>
At the far end stood a mirror; in it, she saw herself multiplied into every guest who had ever asked the riddle, their mouths moving in silent unison. <words>198</words>
The antique doorknob turned itself in her hand, unscrewing until the last fragment—a single brass screw—fell into her palm. <words>221</words>
Letters on the mirror rearranged themselves: “What begins and ends in the same breath?” <words>242</words>
She understood then that the riddle older than time was the act of questioning itself, each investigation eroding the certainty it sought. <words>267</words>
The corridor folded like a book closing, pages of reality turning amid her heartbeat. <words>286</words>
She found herself back on the roller coaster track at dawn, the antique doorknob now fused shut, its secret spent. <words>309</words>
The logs in her pocket had become blank, ready for the next traveler’s entries, the next quiet mania. <words>330</words>
She left the last fragment—the brass screw—wedged between two warped rails, a breadcrumb for whoever would dare the path again. <words>356</words>
As she descended, the track began to erode behind her, wooden beams sighing into sawdust, steel rails bleeding orange flakes that the wind carried like confetti. <words>385</words>
By the time her boots touched the ground, the roller coaster had vanished, leaving only the riddle drifting in the air like the faint scent of old lavender. <words>412</words>
She smiled, ingeniously clueless once more, and walked toward the horizon where another haunted inn surely waited, its logs already whispering her name amid page turns. <words>443</words>
