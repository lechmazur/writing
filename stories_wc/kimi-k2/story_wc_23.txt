The patchwork navigator stood barefoot on the cracked concrete of the starlit signal station, feeling the last warmth of the day seep out of the ground. [28]  
After the hydraulics failed, the great dishes froze mid-swing, their mouths forever open to a sky that no longer spoke. [42]  
She pressed the patina bronze censer foot to her sternum, its green corrosion matching the ache under her ribs. [58]  
Every midnight since the rupture, the censer foot warmed and cooled in pulses that matched the moon’s waxing and waning, a private tide she could not name. [82]  
Tonight the moon hung thin as a paper cut, and the bronze burned like frost. [97]  
Her phone vibrated at 00:00 exactly, the same cryptic phone calls that had started the night her brother vanished into the reverse migration. [120]  
“Build,” the voice whispered, neither male nor female, only wind scraped across metal. [135]  
She had tried to ignore the command, but the geography of loss is a map that folds itself until every crease points back to the missing. [158]  
So she gathered what the station still offered: copper wire, shattered glass, the rubber of perished gaskets, and the censer foot itself. [182]  
Piece by piece she laid them on the dish’s concave face, aligning them by starlight and by the bronze’s fluctuating heat. [207]  
The dish had once tracked satellites; now it would track absence. [221]  
Each midnight call added a new coordinate, spoken in riddles of bone and salt. [237]  
“Where the river forgets its name, plant the glass.” [249]  
“Where the echo learns to swim, coil the wire.” [261]  
She followed the instructions because grief is a compass that spins until you give it somewhere to point. [281]  
On the seventh night the moon was dark, and the censer foot went cold and heavy as a stone heart. [301]  
The voice said, “Build the cradle that rocks backward.” [314]  
She understood then that reverse migration was not a return of bodies but of memory, a way to row upstream through time until the lost stood breathing again. [340]  
She soldered the wire into a cradle shaped like the constellation her brother had tattooed on his shoulder. [361]  
She set the censer foot at its center, the pivot where past and future might balance. [378]  
The dish trembled, not from hydraulics but from the moon pulling at the bronze’s alloyed blood. [395]  
Starlight bent, pooling in the cradle like liquid mercury. [407]  
A shape began to form, translucent, flickering with the phases of the moon: waxing, full, waning, gone. [428]  
It was her brother, or the echo of him, younger than when he left, barefoot like her, carrying the same censer foot he had stolen from their grandmother’s altar. [456]  
He looked at her with eyes that held every night she had not found him. [474]  
She reached out; the cradle’s wire cut her palm, and the blood dripped onto the bronze, sizzling. [493]  
The voice on the phone breathed, “Navigate.” [502]  
She lifted the cradle, feeling its weight fluctuate with the moon’s invisible hand. [518]  
Step by step she walked the dish’s curve, following the bronze’s heat as it rose and fell like a tide chart of sorrow. [540]  
Where the heat peaked, she planted a shard of glass; where it cooled, she unwound a coil of wire. [560]  
A path emerged, not on the ground but in the air, a luminous trail only visible through the censer foot’s green haze. [582]  
Her brother’s echo walked beside her, silent, growing brighter as the moon climbed toward full. [600]  
At the dish’s rim she stopped, the cradle now blazing like a second moon. [615]  
The voice said, “Cross.” [621]  
She stepped forward, the wire cutting into her hands, the bronze searing, but she did not let go. [638]  
The starlit signal station fell away; she stood in the river that had forgotten its name, water cold as melted moonlight. [659]  
Her brother stood on the opposite bank, older now, holding the censer foot she had just released. [678]  
Between them the cradle hovered, a bridge of raw solace built from every midnight call she had answered. [697]  
She crossed, not running, not walking, but drifting like a message finally delivered. [713]  
When she reached him, he pressed the bronze into her palm; it was cool, steady
