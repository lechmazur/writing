The stargazer’s open tower rose above the cliff like a tuning fork aimed at the sky, its stone arches humming with an unheard symphony carried on salt wind. [28]  
Below, the dark sea heaved in slow pulses, and far out, the first whales of the migration traced silver scars across the moonlit water. [45]  
Mara stood at the parapet, arms folded, her skeptical eyes fixed on the horizon as though daring the stars to prove her childhood wonder wrong. [67]  
In her palm lay a single square tile, cool and black, etched with faint lines that looked accidental until moonlight slid across them and they suddenly aligned into a perfect magic square. [96]  
She had found it wedged between two cracked steps that morning, a forgotten fragment of the tower’s original floor, and the moment her thumb brushed its surface, memories not her own fluttered against her ribs like trapped moths. [130]  
A child laughing in a language she didn’t speak, a lullaby hummed by a voice she had never heard, the taste of honey on a tongue that wasn’t hers—entangled memories, loose and drifting, seeking anchor. [168]  
Mara’s first instinct was to drop the tile, to let the sea swallow whatever ghost story clung to it, but the whales sang then, a low chord that vibrated in her sternum, and she hesitated, courageously kind even in doubt. [208]  
She had come to the tower to sculpt space for reflection, to escape the city’s glare and decide whether to abandon the astronomy fellowship that felt increasingly hollow. [248]  
Instead, the tile offered her someone else’s unfinished grief, a mother’s last glimpse of her son before the war, a sailor’s promise to return etched into the same grid of numbers that now glowed faintly under starlight. [295]  
Mara knelt, spreading her jacket on the cold stone, and began to transcribe the patterns revealed by each shift of moon and cloud, lines intersecting like constellation maps drawn by a hand long dissolved to dust. [340]  
The unheard symphony grew louder, not in volume but in presence, as though the tower itself inhaled the whales’ song and exhaled forgotten harmonies into her ears. [378]  
Each number she copied rearranged itself on the page, forming new squares, new memories: a girl releasing a lantern into fog, an old man teaching a child to whistle, a lover pressing a shell into a palm. [425]  
Mara’s skepticism wavered, not into belief but into curiosity sharp enough to cut through fear. [450]  
She realized the tile was not a trap; it was an invitation to witness, to carry forward what might otherwise be lost beneath migrating fins and turning years. [490]  
The whales passed in a slow procession, their spouts catching starlight like brief new galaxies, and Mara understood the migration was both map and clock, marking the distance between remembering and being remembered. [540]  
She worked until dawn paled the eastern edge, transcribing the final square where the numbers spelled out a date she recognized: the night her own mother had died, a night Mara had spent indoors, refusing to look at the sky. [595]  
Tears blurred the page, but her hand remained steady, courageously kind toward the child she had been and the woman she was becoming. [630]  
When the sun cleared the horizon, the tile cooled to ordinary stone, its patterns once again random scratches. [660]  
Mara set it back between the cracked steps, now joined by her notebook tucked beneath a loose stone, pages fluttering like white flags. [695]  
She left the tower lighter, not because the memories were gone but because they had been given shape, space, a place to echo without drowning her. [735]  
The whales were gone, yet their song lingered in her pulse, an unheard symphony she would carry back to the city, back to telescopes and lecture halls, back to nights when wonder felt scarce. [780]  
At the cliff’s edge she paused, turned once more to the empty tower, and whispered a promise into the wind: she would return next migration, notebook in hand, ready to listen again. [800]
