The brass key, warm from the pocket of a secret astral projector, pulsed like a second heartbeat as she hovered above the abandoned carnival roller coaster track. <words>25</words>
In the seconds following a sudden revelation—that the key unlocked not a door but the moment compassion could be weaponized—she felt her silver cord tug, urging her to flee. <words>42</words>
She had come here in practiced spontaneity, letting her sleeping body breathe in a motel three miles east while her spirit practiced survival skills by mapping every rusted bolt and splintered plank. <words>61</words>
Sometimes always, the track had been her proving ground, a place where she rehearsed escape routes by tracking sun shadows that slid like liquid mercury across warped rails. <words>82</words>
Today the shadows stuttered, coalescing into the silhouette of the child she had failed to save last winter, the one whose absence still hollowed her ribs. <words>103</words>
The revelation struck: the antique brass key was the child’s final gift, a plea for unyielding compassion turned outward, not hoarded as a shield. <words>125</words>
If she fled now, she preserved only herself; if she stayed, she risked the cord snapping and her body forever vacant. <words>148</words>
Yet compassion, unyielding, demanded she anchor the child’s echo to something kinder than this ruin. <words>169</words>
She descended, feet brushing the track’s spine, feeling the metal’s cold memory of screams and cotton candy. <words>191</words>
The key grew hotter, branding her palm with the promise that survival skills could serve more than one soul. <words>213</words>
Practiced spontaneity guided her fingers to the control box beneath the highest peak, where sun shadows now pooled like spilled ink. <words>236</words>
She inserted the brass key; gears groaned awake, and the track shuddered, not to run but to remember every laugh it had carried. <words>260</words>
The child’s silhouette brightened, edges softening into starlight that spiraled up through her chest and along the silver cord. <words>284</words>
In the motel, her body gasped, eyes opening to a dawn that tasted of caramel and rust, proof the cord held. <words>307</words>
She fled then, not from the child but with the child, astral form folding back into flesh while the roller coaster exhaled one last lullaby of clanking cars. <words>335</words>
Sometimes always, she would return, tracking sun shadows to see new vines threading the track, a quiet carnival blooming from unyielding compassion. <words>360</words>
The brass key cooled against her heartbeat, its work complete, its lesson etched: survival skills mean little unless they teach others how to stay. <words>387</words>
She walked the midway at sunrise, pockets empty of fear, palms open, ready for the next revelation that would ask her to flee again—this time toward, not away. <words>415</words>
