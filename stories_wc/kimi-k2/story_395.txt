Marshal Anwen Vale, dutiful servant of the Archive Guild, stepped onto the floating island cloud spa with the posture of someone who had never relaxed in her life. <words>25</words>
Below her, gardens of silver thyme and whisper-orchids spiraled through the mist, tended by guests who swayed to a forgotten dance only they could hear. <words>42</words>
She was here, officially, to recover three stolen manuscripts rumored to be hidden among the spa’s perfumed libraries, but the music drifting from the distant festival stage tugged at something consciously rebellious inside her. <words>66</words>
Anwen’s badge felt heavier than gravity as she knelt beside a bed of moon-ferns, pretending to garden while scanning faces for the courier described in her briefing. <words>87</words>
Instead, she found Lys, a barefoot botanist whose pockets overflowed with fortune cookie slips like colorful paper prayers. <words>105</words>
“Looking for something rare?” Lys asked, tilting a slip toward the light; on it was inked the call number of the very first manuscript. <words>127</words>
Anwen’s hand moved to her cuffs, but the distant drums shifted into a minor key, and the marshal hesitated, feeling the island itself breathe. <words>148</words>
Lys offered a trowel. <words>151</words>
“Garden with me,” she said. <words>154</words>
“While the festival plays, the spa forgets to watch its vaults.” <words>165</words>
Throughout the afternoon they worked side by side, planting cuttings and trading fragments of melody like contraband, an unexpected alliance sprouting between duty and defiance. <words>191</words>
Each time Anwen’s spade struck soil, she uncovered another slip: coordinates, cipher keys, a stanza of the forgotten dance notated in petals. <words>216</words>
By twilight the gardens glowed, and the music crescendoed into a waltz older than the Archive. <words>234</words>
Lys brushed dirt from her palms. <words>239</words>
“Third greenhouse, under the glass harp,” she whispered. <words>250</words>
“But the manuscripts won’t leave unless the dance is finished.” <words>261</words>
Anwen almost arrested her then, but the marshal’s own feet began to move, tracing steps she had never learned yet somehow remembered. <words>285</words>
Together they danced down the floating paths, past steam pools where scholars dozed, until they reached the greenhouse shimmering with harp-light. <words>311</words>
Inside, the three manuscripts hovered like sleeping swans above a pool of liquid starlight. <words>332</words>
Anwen reached out, yet paused, hearing the music falter. <words>344</words>
Lys placed a fortune in her hand: “What is saved without love is soon lost again.” <words>365</words>
The marshal’s consciously rebellious heart tilted, not toward betrayal, but toward balance. <words>383</words>
She photographed every page, sent the images to the Archive, then left the originals drifting above the pool, safe in their spa sanctuary. <words>409</words>
As dawn painted the clouds rose, Anwen and Lys released the last fortune into the wind, watching the slip spiral like a tiny kite. <words>434</words>
The island drifted on, gardens and festival forever entwined, while below, the Archive received knowledge without chains, and above, two unlikely allies kept dancing the forgotten steps that kept both stories and freedom alive. <words>500</words>
