The lingering minstrel, openly private in his patched cloak, slipped through the giant's dining room amid rush hour, when iron pots clanged like cathedral bells and steam curled like lost ghosts. <words>31</words>
He clutched the witch’s gnarled wooden ladle, stolen at dawn from a crone who had sworn it could rejuvenate any soul via the texture of a meteorite's surface, though she had never explained how. <words>42</words>
Around him, giants thundered between tables the size of ships, ladling stew into bowls that could drown a village, their laughter booming like avalanches in gentle turmoil. <words>31</words>
He pressed against a chair leg thick as an oak, heart hammering with the same rhythm that once measured tavern reels, desperate to escape a mundane existence of coin tossed for worn-out songs. <words>34</words>
A fallen star, black and pitted, served as the giants’ saltcellar; its surface shimmered with the memory of cosmic night, and the minstrel knew this was the meteorite the witch had meant. <words>35</words>
He crawled beneath the looming table, knees scraping cedar planks, and laid the ladle’s bowl against the star’s rough cheek, feeling silence bloom like frost across his skin. <words>32</words>
The texture spoke in ridges and hollows, telling of burning journeys and cold arrivals, and in that hush he was affirmed by silence more surely than any cheering crowd had ever endorsed his rhymes. <words>34</words>
Steam from the giants’ feast drifted down, warm rain on his shoulders, while the ladle drank starlight and began to glow with a soft green fire that smelled of pine and distant thunder. <words>33</words>
His fingertips tingled; calluses from a thousand strings softened, lungs widened, and the ache of endless roads lifted like morning mist, yet the turmoil remained, gentled into purposeful tremor. <words>34</words>
A giant child stooped, curious eyes like harvest moons, but the minstrel, still openly private, pressed a finger to his lips and the child nodded, keeping the secret without a word. <words>32</words>
Rejuvenated, he tucked the ladle beneath his cloak, its warmth pulsing against his ribs like a second heart, and wove between stamping boots toward the archway that led beyond the hall. <words>33</words>
At the threshold he paused, listening to the giants’ chorus fade into a single, immense heartbeat, and understood that escape was not a place but a song he would now carry, quiet and unbreakable. <words>34</words>
He stepped into the corridor beyond, where torchlight painted amber ripples on stone, and began to hum a melody woven from silence and starlight, gentle turmoil settling into steady flame. <words>32</words>
Behind him, the giant child lifted the meteorite saltcellar, finding only a smooth hollow where the ladle had kissed, and smiled, already forgetting why. <words>26</words>
The minstrel walked on, each footfall a new note, the ladle’s glow fading into his pulse, carrying the vast dining room’s hush within him like a hidden sea. <words>30</words>
