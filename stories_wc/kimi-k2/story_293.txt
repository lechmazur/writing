In the bacteria-powered city of Lumen, where glowing microbes pulsed like heartbeats beneath the glass streets, a nervous minstrel named Corin tuned his lute with trembling fingers. <words>28</words>
He carried a crumpled photograph of a woman whose smile he could no longer trust, the edges worn soft by years of rehearsed lies. <words>38</words>
Tonight, before the lonely candle flame guttered out in his rented garret, he would escape the ordinary rhythm of taverns and half-hearted applause. <words>50</words>
Corin was rarely sincere, a habit born from singing other people's truths for coins, but the stars outside his window felt like an audience that could not be fooled. <words>64</words>
He unfolded a map inked with constellations, each star labeled with a promise: "Follow, and purpose will bloom." <words>75</words>
The city's hum—digestive murmurs of engineered bacteria converting waste into light—grew louder as midnight approached, as if urging him onward. <words>87</words>
With cautious revelry, he strummed a final chord, letting the note linger like a dare. <words>96</words>
He packed only the photograph, the map, and a flask of fermented glow-water, then slipped into the alley where shadows drank the bioluminescence. <words>108</words>
Corin deployed his plan by following star patterns etched into the cobblestones centuries ago by pilgrims who had also sought meaning beyond the city's radiant borders. <words>122</words>
Each step took him farther from the safety of scripted ballads and closer to the hush of the outer dark. <words>133</words>
The photograph grew heavier in his pocket, its image flickering in his mind like a candle about to drown in wax. <words>144</words>
He wondered if the woman had ever been real, or if he had invented her to give his lies a center. <words>155</words>
At the city's edge, the bacteria-light faded, replaced by the cold clarity of constellations he had only pretended to understand. <words>167</words>
Corin hesitated, the minstrel in him craving one last encore, but the stars demanded silence. <words>177</words>
He stepped beyond the final streetlamp, boots crunching on frost, and felt the ordinary fall away like a cloak too thin for winter. <words>189</words>
The map led him to a clearing where starlight pooled like spilled milk, and there he saw her—not the woman in the photograph, but a reflection of who he might become if he stopped lying. <words>204</words>
The candle in his garret guttered out at that exact moment, its smoke curling into the shape of a lute. <words>214</words>
Corin laughed, the sound raw and unfamiliar, and began to sing a song whose words he did not yet know but whose truth he could no longer avoid. <words>226</words>
The bacteria-powered city glowed behind him, a beautiful trap he had finally outgrown. <words>236</words>
He walked on, following the stars not as a performer but as a pilgrim, the photograph now just paper, the woman just memory, and the uncertainty ahead the only honest stage left. <words>252</words>
