The lurking assassin pressed her cheek to the baroque asteroid's obsidian balustrade, feeling borrowed starlight seep through the cracks like cold perfume. <words>21</words>
Below, the unforgiving road spiraled outward in a helix of cracked quartz, each shard reflecting the last bus of the night as it crawled toward the terminus. <words>34</words>
She lifted the paint-splattered camera lens she had stolen from the museum, its glass webbed with cerulean and vermilion like a superficially profound prophecy. <words>47</words>
When the bus driver completes the final route, she thought, the dawn will be delivered, fragile and newborn, into the trembling hands of whoever survives the next minute. <words>61</words>
Her motivation was not murder but mercy: to cradle the dawn in trembling hands before the asteroid's orbit decayed and everything burned. <words>74</words>
She laughed, a sound like ice fracturing, and the echo traveled via the pattern of a spider's web after rain, silver droplets translating her mirth into Morse across the colonnades. <words>90</words>
The web itself had been spun between two cherubs carved centuries ago by exiles who believed beauty could anchor stone to darkness. <words>104</words>
She adjusted the lens, focusing on the bus's windshield where the driver's eyes met hersâ€”ancient, resigned, complicit. <words>116</words>
In that borrowed starlight, their shared secret shimmered: he would brake at the exact moment the asteroid's rotation exposed the sun's first edge, gifting her the newborn light. <words>132</words>
The unforgiving road would keep its promise of endings, but not the one written in the station's timetables. <words>144</words>
She steadied the paint-splattered camera lens, counting heartbeats against the spider's trembling geometry. <words>155</words>
Each droplet on the web refracted a different future: one where she fired, one where she lowered the rifle, one where the bus dissolved into stardust. <words>170</words>
Superficially profound, the choices looked identical until the moment the trigger met her finger. <words>182</words>
The lurking assassin exhaled, and her breath crystallized, joining the borrowed starlight in a brief constellation that spelled no name. <words>195</words>
The bus hissed; brakes sighed; the driver lifted two fingers in farewell. <words>205</words>
She did not shoot. <words>208</words>
Instead, she stepped onto the unforgiving road, camera lens raised, and captured the dawn as it spilled across the baroque asteroid like forgiveness too late to matter. <words>224</words>
The spider drank the light, web blazing gold, and translated her silent laugh into a vibration that would outlast both stone and exile. <words>238</words>
When the asteroid finally cracked open, centuries later, the image remained: a woman cradling sunrise in trembling hands, her rifle abandoned, her motive fulfilled. <words>255</words>
The unforgiving road had become a bridge; the lurking assassin, a guardian; the borrowed starlight, a covenant. <words>268</words>
And somewhere in the debris, a paint-splattered lens spun, still recording the pattern of a spider's web after rain. <words>282</words>
