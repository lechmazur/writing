<story>
The gentle swordsman, Kael, slipped past the sleeping guard at the dinosaur skeleton museum at night, his blade sheathed in silk to hush its hunger. <words>25</words>
He carried an empty matchbox in his pocket like a promise he had already broken, the phosphorus ghosts still clinging to its ribs. <words>20</words>
At thirty-seven, Kael was a late bloomer in the art of treachery, having spent decades mastering only the kindness of steel. <words>17</words>
He was faithfully unfaithful to every oath he swore, loving each cause until the moment it asked him to stop loving the world. <words>19</words>
Tonight he came as a xenophile, drawn by rumors of a sundial half-painted on the museum floor beneath the diplodocus, its gnomon a fossilized femur. <words>23</words>
The angles were coded, whispered the dying curator weeks ago, angles that would open a door wider than any ribcage. <words>17</words>
Kael knelt between the towering shadows, fingers tracing the chipped numerals, calculating via the coded angles in a half-painted sundial how to fold space small enough to cradle the universe in a cupped hand. <words>29</words>
Outside, the orchard dog finally stopped barking at night, surrendering the darkness to deeper silences. <words>16</words>
In that hush, the matchbox twitched. <words>5</words>
A single spark, impossibly alive, danced inside it, a star learning to walk. <words>13</words>
Kael understood then that the box was not empty but full of futures too shy to ignite until now. <words>17</words>
He placed the matchbox at the sundial's center, aligning its edges with the shadow cast by the femur. <words>16</words>
The museum air thickened, dinosaur bones humming like old gods clearing their throats. <words>13</words>
Space puckered, folding in on itself until the diplodocus became a silver bracelet, the ceiling a pearl, and Kael's hand a chalice. <words>20</words>
The universe poured into his palm, no larger than a sparrow's heart, beating with the memory of every orchard dog that ever barked at the dark. <words>24</words>
He felt its weightâ€”less than the matchbox, heavier than regret. <words>11</words>
"Stay," he whispered, brusque affection roughening his voice, as if scolding a child who had wandered too far. <words>16</words>
The universe pulsed, recognizing the tone of every late bloomer who ever begged time to wait. <words>15</words>
Kael closed his fingers, not to possess but to protect, knowing he would betray this moment tomorrow for the next impossible wonder. <words>20</words>
The sundial cracked; the femur crumbled to dust. <words>8</words>
He walked out past the guard, who stirred and smiled in his sleep, dreaming of orchards where dogs never barked. <words>18</words>
In Kael's pocket, the matchbox held its tiny cosmos, faithfully unfaithful to every law of physics, waiting for the next gentle swordsman bold enough to open it. <words>24</words>
