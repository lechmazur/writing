<story>
Ranger Juno patrols the urban orchard grafted onto the old overpass, pruning rogue figs while the city below sleeps its final dreamless sleep. <words>25</words>
She clutches a plain notebook whose pages she has numbered in chaotic spirals, each digit a breadcrumb toward the echo of the goddess her grandmother once served in secret. <words>34</words>
The orchard itself is familiarly unknown: every apricot tree she planted yesterday seems to have grown from cuttings her grandmother hid decades earlier, roots threading through concrete like whispered continuations. <words>46</words>
Juno’s heartbeats fluctuate with the traffic lights that still cycle though no cars come, red to green to red, as if the city’s circadian rhythm is trying to dream for the absent humans. <words>59</words>
She records each anomaly in the notebook, believing that when the tally reaches a prime number the goddess will speak through the static of leaves. <words>71</words>
A breeze carries the scent of bergamot and memory; Juno turns and meets the gaze of a fox wearing her grandmother’s lost locket, the first of today’s chance encounters. <words>84</words>
The fox drops the locket at her boots and vanishes between blueberry bushes, leaving Juno to decipher the engraving: a spiral matching the chaotic page numbers. <words>96</words>
She pockets the locket and continues her patrol, counting fallen pomegranates like rosary beads, each fruit a syllable in a prayer she was never taught aloud. <words>108</words>
A second encounter: a child’s bicycle, rusted yet spinning upright on its kickstand, pedals turning in wind that should be still. <words>119</words>
Juno writes the bicycle’s serial number beside the fox’s paw prints, noticing the digits form the same prime she has been chasing. <words>130</words>
The overpass trembles; figs rain like dark constellations, and in their scatter she sees the outline of a woman woven from moonlight and mulch. <words>142</words>
The goddess steps closer, barefoot on asphalt warmed by phantom engines, and her voice is the sound of notebooks slamming shut in libraries that no longer exist. <words>155</words>
Juno’s questions fluctuate into silence; instead she offers the locket, the notebook, the entire orchard as collateral for one syllable of truth. <words>167</words>
The goddess accepts by breathing through the trees; every leaf flips to reveal a word written in her grandmother’s ink: Remember. <words>179</words>
Juno understands: the secrets were never hidden but scattered, waiting for an overzealous ranger to reassemble them through chance encounters after dreaming ended. <words>192</words>
She closes the notebook, now complete, and the orchard rearranges itself into a spiral path leading down into the city where the first new dream is already beginning to sprout. <words>205</words>
