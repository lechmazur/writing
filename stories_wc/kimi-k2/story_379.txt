The trickster lawyer, Mara Voss, crouched between rows of phosphor-fruit vines inside the biodome, her pulse syncing with the ghostly hum of nutrient pumps. <words>21</words>
She was impatiently patient, counting seconds until the patrol drones drifted past, rehearsing the stretch that would let her slip under the infrared net. <words>31</words>
During stretching, she palmed the leftover gift tag she’d torn from a crate marked “For Aya—Happy 80th,” its faded ribbon now a bookmark for dying verbs. <words>42</words>
Every disappearing language she failed to catalogue tonight would be another silence in the galaxy’s mouth, and that thought chilled her more than the recycled air. <words>54</words>
Her high school rivals—now senior linguists for the Conglomerate—had spent years sending cryptic dares across dark forums: “Find the root before the root finds you.” <words>67</words>
Tonight’s dare blinked on her wristpad: “Divert the archive train at sector nine, or admit the tongue of the river people was never real.” <words>79</words>
Mara smiled the same crooked smile that once won mock trials and lost real friends, then ghosted through the hydroponic mist toward the maglev siding. <words>92</words>
The futuristic farm around her glowed like a cathedral of chlorophyll, every leaf a pixel in the dome’s illusion of endless summer. <words>104</words>
She pressed the gift tag against a scanner; its recycled fibers still carried Aya’s thumbprint, the last speaker of river-fluent, and the gate sighed open. <words>117</words>
Inside the archive car, data stalks rose like amber wheat, each sheaf a lexicon slated for incineration at dawn. <words>128</words>
Mara’s chosen path forked here: run with the stolen languages or stay and fight the law she once twisted for profit. <words>140</words>
She remembered the final stretch before graduation, when her rivals dared her to steal the principal’s voiceprint; she did, then sold it to a political campaign, and the river people’s protests were drowned in robocalls. <words>156</words>
Guilt tasted metallic now, like the recycled water condensing on her lips. <words>165</words>
She rerouted the train via a maintenance tunnel, whispering every river word she knew into the onboard recorder, her voice steady despite the sirens blooming outside. <words>178</words>
The train lurched, diverted toward the old launch pad where a courier drone waited, its hold empty except for the promise of orbit. <words>190</words>
Mara left the gift tag pinned to the console, a breadcrumb for the pursuers she hoped would someday follow and learn. <words>202</words>
As the dome’s inner moonlamps dimmed for artificial night, she exhaled ghostly resolve, feeling the weight of every syllable she carried into the stars. <words>215</words>
Outside the plexiglass, the patrol drones circled like confused fireflies, their searchlights sweeping the rows of glowing wheat that would never know the word for moonlight in river-fluent. <words>230</words>
Mara’s wristpad buzzed again: next dare, next language, next impossible horizon. <words>240</words>
She accepted, because chosen paths are only chains if you forget why you ran in the first place. <words>252</words>
The courier drone lifted, engines humming a lullaby in a tongue only three living beings could understand, and Mara began to catalogue, impatiently patient, stretching toward every vanishing voice. <words>268</words>
