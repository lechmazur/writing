The underwater welder, Lira, stood patiently impatient at the crossing where two timelines should never meet, her gloved fingers drumming against the vintage button box she had salvaged from a drowned carousel. <words>31</words>
Inside the broken planetarium reimagined as a nightclub, starlight dripped from cracked domes while bass lines pulsed like dying suns, and she felt the inherited mystery of her grandmother's final dive settle on her shoulders like silt. <words>42</words>
Every mirror in the vintage store section of the club—framed in art-deco brass and smeared with cosmic dust—offered glimpses of moments of unraveling: her own reflection aging backward, her grandmother's face surfacing in silvered glass, timelines bleeding together like oil in water. <words>57</words>
She had come to pamper the machine, to coax improbable power from its rusted circuits, because the button box was no toy—it was a key, and the planetarium's projector still remembered how to open doors that should stay closed. <words>46</words>
The welder's torch, usually reserved for sealing hull breaches, now traced sigils across the box's lid, each spark a syllable in a language spoken only by those who had drowned and returned with salt in their veins. <words>42</words>
Through the mirrors she watched herself in another timeline, a version who had never learned patience, who had rushed the ritual and shattered the continuum like thin ice. <words>34</words>
That Lira's screams echoed faintly, a warning threaded through the club's music, as dancers orbited the DJ booth like planets forgetting their stars. <words>29</words>
She pressed the first button—mother-of-pearl, cracked—and felt the inherited mystery deepen, her grandmother's memories flooding in: the original planetarium before the flood, the first breach between worlds, the price paid in breath and time. <words>45</words>
The second button, brass and warm, showed her the future she could steal: herself wielding improbable power, timelines bending like reeds, the planetarium restored but empty of all life save her own immortal vigil. <words>42</words>
Her hands shook, patiently impatient, as she lifted the torch to seal the box forever, but the mirrors caught her eye—her grandmother's reflection nodding, urging, whispering that some doors must be opened so others can close. <words>42</words>
Lira pressed the final button, cobalt and cold, and the nightclub froze mid-beat, dancers suspended like constellations, while the planetarium's dome cracked open to reveal not stars but the dark water of her grandmother's last dive. <words>44</words>
She stepped through, torch in hand, to pamper the wound between worlds, knowing that wielding improbable power meant becoming the inherited mystery itself, a story told in glimpses through vintage store mirrors for those who came after. <words>44</words>
