The groggy brewer, still tasting last night's stout, stumbled through the haunted mansion graveyard during the lull in a protest when voices gather again, clutching a piece of a broken mirror like it was the last pint glass in the world. <words>42</words>
He had come to this uniquely generic corner of eternity because someone on the internet swore the encroaching darkness could be bottled, corked, and sold as "Midnight Ale" at an obscene markup. <words>34</words>
Yet the mansion loomed, all peeling grandeur and sarcastic ivy, as if even the architecture doubted his business plan. <words>19</words>
He tripped on a half-sunk headstone, swore with flippant solemnity, and noticed via the slightest discoloration on a dusty spiral staircase that the cellar door hung open like a yawning critic. <words>31</words>
Inside, the staircase corkscrewed downward, each step a complaint against his weight, the air thick with the perfume of forgotten sins and malted regret. <words>25</words>
Halfway down, the brewer paused, hearing the protest above swell again—chants for justice, for change, for cheaper beer—and felt suddenly ashamed of his profit motive. <words>29</words>
He lifted the shard; in its jagged reflection, the encroaching darkness pooled behind him, wearing his own face but nobler, as if it had read better manifestos. <words>27</words>
"Look," he told the darkness, "I just wanted to become a living embodiment of one's values, preferably with a decent head of foam." <words>25</words>
The darkness answered by deepening the discoloration on the next step, a bruise of shadow that spelled, if you squinted, the word "initiate." <words>24</words>
Sighing, the brewer stepped onto the bruise; the staircase flattened into a tunnel lined with fermenting tombstones, each engraved with a principle he had once toasted then ignored. <words>27</words>
At the tunnel's end stood a copper kettle big enough to boil regrets, its surface mirroring the mansion's graveyard, the protest, and his own bloodshot eyes. <words>26</words>
The encroaching darkness wrapped around him like a brewing jacket and whispered, "Recipe: one soul, clarified; one cause, hopped with courage; ferment until the voices above sound like hymns." <words>32</words>
He dropped the mirror shard into the kettle; it dissolved with a hiss that tasted like last call and first light. <words>21</words>
Above, the protest crescendoed, footsteps drumming on the mansion's rotten porch, demanding entry, demanding change. <words>19</words>
The brewer understood then that values aren't bottled; they are poured, shared, spilled, and sometimes thrown in the face of tyrants. <words>24</words>
He laughed, a sound both ridiculous and solemn, and began to climb, carrying the kettle's glow like a lantern made of convictions. <words>23</words>
As he emerged into the graveyard, the darkness followed, no longer encroaching but walking beside him, a partner in the ridiculous solemnity of trying to be better. <words>27</words>
Together they joined the protest, offering cups of shadow that tasted, miraculously, of hope, and the voices rose again, this time with notes of barley and revolution. <words>27</words>
