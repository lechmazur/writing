The mild-tempered guard named Lorne pedaled his rusted cruiser along the event horizon bike path of the Black Hole Resort, tires humming poetically bland lullabies to the void. <words>27</words>
Between rides he polished the blacksmith’s anvil bolted to the resort’s courtyard, pretending it was merely decorative while its iron heart pulsed with the unraveling thread of every story ever swallowed by gravity. <words>37</words>
Guests demanded he choose: wear the white sash of hero or the crimson badge of villain, but Lorne’s motivation was to refuse the false dichotomy of hero or villain, so he practiced disguise instead. <words>49</words>
He studied the stray cats that prowled the neon alleys behind the singularity spa, learning their slink and shadow, and by following stray cats through alleyways he mapped exits the physicists swore did not exist. <words>63</words>
One tabby led him to a service corridor where gravity reversed and ceiling became floor; Lorne stepped off his bike and felt savage bliss flood his veins as the resort’s rules inverted. <words>78</words>
The corridor ended at the anvil’s twin, hidden in a forgotten forge, its surface etched with the same unraveling thread now glowing like embers. <words>90</words>
He pressed his palm to the metal and memories poured through: every condemned soul who had been forced to choose sides, their screams braided into the thread. <words>103</words>
Lorne understood then that the resort fed on absolutes, sharpening heroes into blades and villains into whetstones, both cutting the same flesh. <words>115</words>
He stripped off his uniform, wrapped himself in soot and stray-cat fur, and completed his disguise until even the mirrors forgot his face. <words>127</words>
Back on the bike path he pedaled against the spin of the accretion disk, scattering tourists like startled pigeons, the anvil’s echo ringing in his spokes. <words>140</words>
Security drones descended, broadcasting the ultimatum: hero or villain, choose now. <words>149</words>
Lorne laughed, a sound like torn silk, and flicked the unraveling thread toward them; it caught their lenses and rewrote their code into lullabies. <words>162</words>
The drones began to croon poetically bland verses about uncertainty, circling him in a lazy waltz. <words>172</words>
He rode through them, through the lobby, through the gift shop selling miniature singularities, until he reached the launch bay where the cats waited atop stolen escape pods. <words>186</words>
Together they fired thrusters, not to flee the black hole but to dive past its point of no return, where labels dissolved and only motion remained. <words>199</words>
As the event horizon stretched into a tunnel of savage bliss, Lorne looked back once at the resort’s twinkling lights and whispered, “I choose the third thing.” <words>213</words>
The unraveling thread snapped free, weaving itself into a new constellation that spelled neither savior nor scourge, only witness. <words>226</words>
Behind him the Black Hole Resort flickered, confused by a guest who had paid with possibility instead of identity. <words>238</words>
Ahead, the cats purred in harmonics that bent spacetime into a Möbius strip, endless bike rides along the edge of definition. <words>250</words>
Lorne smiled, mild temper intact, and pedaled into the loop, forever amid bike rides that went nowhere and everywhere at once. <words>263</words>
