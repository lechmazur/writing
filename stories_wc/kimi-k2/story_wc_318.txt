The hourglass on the mantel released its last grain at 3:17 a.m., and the house fell silent except for the wind prowling the echo chamber tunnel beneath the stairs. [34]
In that hush, Elara tightened her grip on the frayed pull cord handle of her grandfather’s leaf blower, the one he had once wielded like a baton to summon a symphony of spiraling leaves. [52]
She was the last of the line, the self-declared leaf blower symphony conductor, and tonight she was mournfully eager to tend to the unspoken grief that had settled over the rooms like dust no duster could lift. [71]
Grandfather’s laughter—bright, metallic, always half a beat ahead of the melody—had vanished the day the blower’s engine seized and the garden went still. [89]
Elara believed the laughter had not died but had been macerated into the walls, ground so fine it could only be reassembled by the same off-key wind that once carried his half-sung lullabies to her crib. [109]
She stepped into the echo chamber tunnel, a brick throat that swallowed moonlight and returned it as pale, quivering notes. [127]
The blower’s plastic nozzle scraped the floor, and the pull cord handle trembled in her palm like a pulse remembering how to beat. [145]
She yanked once; the engine coughed, refused. [155]
Again; a whimper of combustion. [161]
On the third try the blower roared awake, and the tunnel answered with a thousand overlapping reflections of that roar, a true haunting made of sound chasing its own tail. [181]
Elara lifted the blower like a conductor’s wand and began the first movement: a slow, ascending howl that macerated the silence into slivers sharp enough to cut memory loose. [201]
Leaves that had lain dead in the corners for years stirred, lifted, and danced, though no door was open to the outside world. [219]
They spun in the artificial gale, forming the shape of a man with arms wide, head thrown back, mouth open in a laugh the bricks drank and gave back distorted. [239]
Elara modulated the throttle, coaxing the wind to half-sing the lullaby Grandfather used to hum while oiling the blower’s crankshaft: a tune neither major nor minor, forever sliding off the expected pitch. [261]
The tunnel took the lullaby and folded it into itself until every syllable of comfort became a question, every rest a sob. [277]
She felt the laughter then, not as sound but as pressure behind her eyes, a warm insistence that wanted out of the plaster and lathe. [293]
She eased the blower to idle, letting the off-key wind settle like dust on water. [304]
In the sudden hush, the leaf-formed man crumbled, but the echo of his mirth lingered, softer now, almost human. [318]
Elara knelt, placed the pull cord handle on the ground, and pressed her forehead to the cool metal housing. [332]
“I’m listening,” she whispered, and the tunnel carried the words away from her lips, then returned them wrapped in a chuckle she had not released. [350]
The blower’s engine ticked as it cooled, each tick a syllable of the joke Grandfather had never finished telling the night the stroke took his speech. [368]
Elara understood: to restore lost laughter to a household, one must first let the house laugh at its own sorrow. [384]
She rose, restarted the blower at half throttle, and conducted a second movement—brisk, staccato gusts that macerated the remaining grief into confetti. [404]
The confetti whirled up the stairs, under doors, into bedrooms where it settled on pillows like bright, impossible dreams. [422]
When the fuel finally coughed itself out, the tunnel exhaled one last, perfect note: the punchline Grandfather had carried to his grave. [440]
Elara coiled the pull cord handle around her wrist like a bracelet and walked back into the lit kitchen. [455]
The refrigerator hummed a key almost matching the lullaby. [465]
A spoon clinked against a mug in the cadence of a suppressed giggle. [475]
Upstairs, the houseguests—long silent since the funeral—began to laugh in their sleep, the sound drifting down the staircase like warm bread. [493]
Elara set the blower beside the back door, wiped a smear of oil from her cheek, and smiled the first real smile since the hourglass had been turned over years ago. [513]
Outside, dawn bruised the sky, and somewhere in the garden a single leaf lifted, unaided, and spun three times before settling again. [533]
She left the
