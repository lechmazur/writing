On a floating rock dojo adrift in the violet dusk, the morbid florist knelt, neutrally passionate about the plain white candle she balanced between two calloused thumbs. <words>31</words>
Its wick was the last flicker of a guttering lantern, and she had come to oblige the dying light, believing that even endings deserved witnesses. <words>25</words>
She had once arranged funeral wreaths with the same tempered beliefs, trimming stems so death would look tidy, but tonight she sought to understand cosmic cycles instead of merely decorating them. <words>29</words>
Behind her, the dojo’s cedar floorboards hovered inches above the void, creaking like old bones whenever the rock tilted, reminding her that everything, even discipline, eventually drifts. <words>27</words>
She opened the writer’s trunk she had dragged across galaxies, its brass corners scarred by asteroid dust, and began to read through the backlog of typed pages by the candle’s shrinking halo. <words>30</words>
Each sheet smelled of iron gall ink and regret; the author, long vanished, had written of reincarnation as a florist who kept forgetting the names of flowers, a joke the cosmos now aimed at her. <words>29</words>
Boldly timid, she whispered the sentences aloud, letting the words braid with the hiss of melting wax, forming a fragile rope between her small life and the spiral arms turning above. <words>27</words>
One page described a seed that only germinated in starlight; another claimed every blossom was a planet’s apology for the meteor that birthed it. <words>24</words>
She felt her tempered beliefs shift, not shatter, like petals unfolding under slow pressure, and understood that accepting impermanence was not surrender but cultivation. <words>26</words>
The candle guttered lower, its flame leaning toward the pages as if eager to read its own eulogy, and she obliged by tilting the sheet so the light could taste the ink. <words>27</words>
In that final flicker she saw the pattern: life, death, compost, seed, life again, each stage a necessary stanza in the poem the universe recites to itself. <words>28</words>
She pressed the warm stub into the center of the last page, letting wax seal the author’s confession and her own, a graft between strangers across time. <words>25</words>
The lantern died; darkness bloomed like a black chrysanthemum, yet the dojo kept floating, carrying her and the trunk toward the next dawn she would arrange into a bouquet of light. <words>30</words>
She bowed to the invisible sensei of cycles, petals of resolve opening in her chest, and began to type fresh pages by starlight, ready to plant them in whatever soil the rock found next. <words>32</words>
