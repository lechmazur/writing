General Voss slumped at the counter of the Dark Matter Diner, the only place open between rides on the orbital tram, nursing a cup of coffee that tasted like burnt stardust.<words>29</words>
In his pocket lay a strip of dried seaweed, the last souvenir from a planet he’d glassed by accident, its salt still stinging the cracks in his palm.<words>25</words>
The diner’s walls were papered with black-and-white photographs, each arc of light a frozen scream from forgotten battles, and Voss stared at them as if they might renew the parts of him that had gone quiet.<words>33</words>
A waitress shaped like a probability cloud refilled his cup and whispered, “Fear’s been sitting on the throne of reason too long, General; even dark matter gets tired of its own gravity.”<words>32</words>
Voss laughed, a sound like rusted medals clinking, and laid the seaweed on the counter like a surrender flag.<words>18</words>
“Shared anxieties,” he muttered, “are the only rations that never run out.”<words>13</words>
The photograph nearest him showed a child offering a flower to a tank; the arc of the petals bent into the barrel, rationally absurd yet mathematically perfect.<words>25</words>
He traced the arc with a trembling finger, remembering how he once ordered ceasefires just to watch birds settle on artillery.<words>21</words>
Between rides, time dilated like a sigh; the tram’s next arrival was both imminent and impossible, so Voss stayed, suspended between duty and regret.<words>24</words>
The waitress slid a plate across the counter: more dried seaweed arranged like a crown.<words>14</words>
“Eat your fear,” she said, “and it becomes fuel.”<words>9</words>
Voss chewed the brittle strands, tasting ozone and apology, and felt the throne inside his skull wobble.<words>17</words>
He pulled out his comm-pad, intending to send a resignation, but instead sketched arcs over the screen, copying the photographs’ curves until they formed a spiral that swallowed every order he’d ever given.<words>32</words>
The mischievous wisdom of the act made him grin like a cadet stealing kisses before bombardment.<words>17</words>
Outside, the tram screamed into the station, but Voss remained, sliding the seaweed crown onto his bald head.<words>17</words>
“I abdicate,” he told the photographs, “and appoint wonder in fear’s place.”<words>13</words>
The arcs in the pictures shimmered, as if agreeing, and the diner’s gravity lightened until Voss floated an inch above his stool.<words>21</words>
The waitress winked, her edges blurring into starlight, and handed him a new strip of seaweed still wet with possibility.<words>18</words>
He tucked it into his pocket, not as a souvenir but as a seed, and walked out into the corridor between rides, whistling a tune that had no march in it.<words>28</words>
Behind him, the Dark Matter Diner folded into itself like a secret, leaving only the photographs orbiting an empty counter, their arcs now forming a doorway open to anyone willing to dethrone their own fear.<words>34</words>
