The blooming library above clouds had opened its doors only after dreams became shareable, its shelves of glass petals holding every reverie ever surrendered to the sky. [34]  
Among the drifting readers drifted Lira, a sharp-eyed dusk noticer whose task was to watch the horizon for the first bruise of night and record how hope changed color. [50]  
Each evening she carried a single river stone in her pocket, worn smooth by centuries of mountain water, a keepsake from the world below she no longer trusted. [66]  
The stone was her compass when the sky’s directions dissolved into rose and violet, reminding her that weight could still anchor thought. [82]  
One twilight, while shelving a dream of children flying paper lanterns, she felt the stone pulse like a second heart. [96]  
She turned to the western window and saw a shadow unbound—black, edgeless, stretching across cloud fields where no building cast it. [110]  
The shadow moved softly deliberate, as though tasting each sunlit shelf before swallowing it. [123]  
Lira’s orders were to catalogue, never to intervene, yet the sight chilled the hope she had sworn to preserve. [137]  
She hurried to the archive chamber where silent video footage from decades apart hung in midair like frozen dragonflies. [152]  
Projected side by side were two recordings of the same cloudscape: one from the year dreams were first bottled, one from the week before. [168]  
In the older film, the horizon glowed with steady amber, lanterns of hope drifting upward in orderly spirals. [182]  
In the newer, the same horizon bled into charcoal, the lanterns flickering out as the shadow unbound devoured their light. [196]  
Lira began to compare the footage frame by frame, her sharp eyes noting how the shadow’s outline matched the silhouette of the library itself. [212]  
The realization struck her: the building had begun to metamorphose, its glass petals darkening into wings that would eclipse the sky. [226]  
She pressed the river stone to her lips, feeling its coolness turn warm, as if it recognized the threat and offered its weight as resistance. [241]  
The stone had once been part of a riverbed where children skipped wishes across water; now it carried every skipped hope inside it. [256]  
Lira understood that to preserve the shape of hope she must anchor the library before its transformation completed. [270]  
She climbed the spiral staircase of blooming shelves, each step releasing a fragrance of remembered summers. [284]  
At the top, the shadow pooled like spilled ink around the dream-index, petals folding into talons. [297]  
Lira knelt and placed the river stone at the center of the index, where the oldest dream of flight still fluttered. [311]  
The stone sank slightly, as if the cloud floor were water, and the dream wrapped around it like moss. [324]  
A hush fell; even the shadow paused, tasting the stone’s memory of unhurried currents. [336]  
In that luminous regret, Lira spoke aloud the name of every child whose lantern had once risen from the riverbank. [351]  
Each name became a filament of light, stitching the shadow to the stone, forcing it to take the stone’s shape. [365]  
The metamorphose reversed: glass wings folded back into petals, charcoal bled into gold, and the shadow shrank until it lay curled like a sleeping cat around the river stone. [382]  
The library sighed, shelves straightening, dreams brightening. [392]  
Lira remained at the summit, hand resting on the stone, feeling its weight steady the sky. [404]  
She knew the shadow was not destroyed, merely bound again, and that someday another dusk noticer would have to choose between recording and resisting. [421]  
Yet for now the horizon held its amber line, and shareable dreams once more drifted upward in orderly spirals. [436]  
She recorded the event in the ledger, her handwriting softly deliberate, each stroke a promise that hope could still be shaped. [452]  
Then she slipped the warmed river stone back into her pocket, feeling it pulse with the rhythm of distant water. [466]  
Below, readers unaware of the crisis continued to browse dreams of unborn summers, their faces lit by the library’s restored glow. [482]  
Lira watched them and felt luminous regret: joy for what was saved, sorrow for what almost slipped away. [496]  
She descended the staircase, petals brushing her shoulders like forgiven ghosts. [508]  
At the entrance she paused, sharp eyes scanning the dusk for the first bruise of night, ready to notice whatever came next. [524]  
The stone in her pocket seemed to whisper that every shadow contains the memory of light, waiting for a hand
