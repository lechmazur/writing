The orchard planet of Cerulea drifted beneath a sky of floating rock arches, their shadows striping the apple-red soil like bruises. [25]
In the village of Hollow Stem, the meek blacksmith Elowen kept her forge cold, afraid the clang would wake the grief she carried like slag in her chest. [45]
She had once hammered plowshares and pruning hooks for the floating orchards, but since the magician’s silk—an iridescent ribbon no wider than a finger—had fluttered down and wrapped itself around her anvil, every spark felt like betrayal. [75]
The silk whispered at dusk, promising bartered awakenings: trade one memory of pain, receive one seed of strength. [90]
Elowen, quietly determined, refused the bargain, fearing the memory she would lose was the last image of her brother’s smile before the rock arches quaked and buried the eastern grove. [110]
Yet the orchards were failing; fruit hung small and gray, and the arches themselves shed gravel like old bones. [125]
Villagers spoke of leaving, of abandoning the mine shafts that riddled the planet’s crust, shafts once glittering with azure crystal and now echoing only wind. [145]
Elowen walked those shafts at twilight, lantern low, studying the fallen crystal, deliberate in her search for something unbroken. [165]
She found it in a seam of untouched azure, glowing softly, the same hue as the defiant sky that refused to darken into night. [180]
The silk stirred on her wrist, tightening, offering again: one shard of sorrow for one shard of sky. [195]
Between understanding and confusion—that liminal heartbeat where grief and hope share the same pulse—Elowen hesitated. [210]
She remembered her brother teaching her to quench steel in the runoff from the floating arches, how the water tasted of storms and stars. [230]
If she traded that memory, would the steel remember for her? [240]
She pressed the azure crystal to the silk. [245]
The exchange was silent: the silk drank the memory, color draining from its weave, and the crystal warmed, pulsing like a second heart. [265]
Elowen felt the absence immediately, a hollow where laughter had been, but also a new tensile strength threading her veins. [280]
She carried the crystal back to her forge, lit the coals for the first time in a season, and began to hammer. [295]
Each blow shaped not a tool but a lattice, delicate yet unyielding, meant to cradle the weakened roots of the oldest orchard trees. [315]
Villagers watched from the lane, drawn by the azure glow leaking from the smithy like dawn in reverse. [330]
When the lattice was finished, Elowen dragged it through the abandoned mine shafts, using the old cart rails the miners had left to rust. [350]
The arches overhead hummed, sensing purpose. [355]
At the heart of the eastern grove, where her brother had died, she set the lattice around the gnarled trunk of a dying star-apple tree. [375]
The crystal flared, threads of azure climbing the bark, knitting fractures, coaxing resilience from rubble. [390]
Fruit swelled, blushing from gray to gold. [395]
But the silk, now colorless, slithered from her wrist and wound up the tree, weaving itself into the new leaves. [410]
A breeze carried a voice—her brother’s—soft as forge smoke: “You gave me away, yet here I am.” [430]
Elowen’s knees buckled, not from sorrow but from the shock of recognition: the memory had not been erased, only transformed, alloyed into something stronger. [450]
The villagers came with baskets, eyes wide, and for the first time they saw the blacksmith not as meek but as quietly determined, a woman who had bartered with her own heart and won. [475]
They asked her to repeat the miracle for every dying tree. [485]
Elowen agreed, but warned them: each lattice would cost a memory, and the price must be chosen with care. [500]
Together they walked the mine shafts, harvesting azure crystal, trading laughter, first kisses, the scent of rain on iron—each loss birthing a deeper root, a brighter fruit. [525]
The floating arches stabilized, their gravel ceasing to fall. [535]
Orchards glowed like constellations against the defiant sky. [545]
Elowen kept one sliver of azure for herself, setting it in a ring she never removed. [560]
When children asked why the sky stayed blue even at midnight, she told them it was the color of memories that refused to forget their own worth. [580]
And when the last tree bore fruit so luminous it riv
