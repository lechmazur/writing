The morose sentinel stood at Gate 7½ of the interdimensional airport lounge, amber pendant pulsing like a trapped sunset against his armor of tarnished silver. <words>25</words>
Across the tapestry of hidden hours, where departures and arrivals blurred into one endless sigh, he waited for the tide that would carry him back to a home he could no longer name. <words>42</words>
Every surface in the lounge reflected him in fragments—mirrors showing younger versions, windows revealing futures he had bartered away—yet none showed the place he guarded in his heart. <words>61</words>
He clutched the pendant tighter, feeling its warmth seep through the metal of his gauntlet, objectively emotional proof that something once mattered enough to be preserved. <words>81</words>
The blacksmith's anvil stood abandoned near the duty-free shop, its hammered shapes catching starlight from dimensions that leaked through the ceiling tiles. <words>101</words>
Each dent and curve on the anvil matched scars on the sentinel's breastplate, wounds earned through centuries of compromise between duty and desire. <words>121</words>
He approached the anvil slowly, boots echoing against marble that shifted between obsidian and pearl with each step, and began to unfurl the map etched into his memory. <words>144</words>
The amber pendant swung like a pendulum as he worked, its golden light tracing patterns that corresponded to the hammered shapes, each strike of the absent hammer a heartbeat in reverse. <words>168</words>
Passengers flowed around him—businessmen with briefcases full of stardust, mothers cradling infants who aged backward, lovers exchanging currencies of forgotten dreams—yet none saw the sentinel's private ritual. <words>196</words>
By matching the hammered shapes on the blacksmith's anvil, he discovered the coordinates weren't locations but moments, specific instances when home had existed as more than absence. <words>223</words>
The first shape revealed his childhood window, where morning light had painted his mother's face in amber tones identical to the pendant's glow. <words>248</words>
The second showed his father's forge, where compromise had been taught as an art—how to bend without breaking, how to shape metal and memory into something that could withstand time's erosion. <words>280</words>
As he traced the final shape, the lounge began to dissolve, its familiar strangeness peeling away like old paint, revealing the raw fabric of possibility beneath. <words>308</words>
The tides of compromise that had carried him so far from himself now reversed, pulling him not backward but inward, toward the home that had never been a place but a collection of amber moments. <words>342</words>
The pendant grew warm, then hot, then blinding, and in its light he saw that resurrection wasn't about returning but about recognizing what had never truly left. <words>373</words>
When the glow faded, the sentinel stood in an empty lounge that was somehow fuller than before, the anvil silent, the pendant now clear as tears, and he understood that home was the weight of memory itself. <words>410</words>
