Every dusk at the tidal power monitoring station, the naive gambler named Ludo set a single tallow stub in the rustic candle mold he’d stolen from his grandmother’s attic, believing the wax could ransom one last spark before oblivion swallowed the coast. <words>46</words>
The mold, scarred by generations of thumbprints, felt warm, as though it remembered every unspoken bargain ever dripped into its hollow. <words>59</words>
Ludo laughed with tears in his eyes because the station’s turbines sang like drunken whales, rarely predictable in their rhythm, and he had bet his final hour that their sighs could teach him how to win against the dark. <words>82</words>
At midnight, the dock groaned under the weight of moonlit water, and the unhinged professors arrived, cloaked in seaweed and star charts, to deliver rebellious midnight lectures on the mathematics of candle smoke. <words>108</words>
They claimed each spiral of smoke was a letter in a treaty between flame and night, and whoever read the treaty could rewrite the terms of extinction. <words>131</words>
Ludo listened, shuffling cards he no longer intended to play, while the professors poured saltwater into the mold, insisting brine would make the wax remember the tide. <words>158</words>
During candlelit dinners of tinned sardines and regret, the professors argued over whether the soul was a wick or a wave, and Ludo laughed harder, tears salting his sardines, because both answers felt like losing bets. <words>190</words>
He told them he wanted to capture one last spark before oblivion, not for glory, but to mail it backward through time to the child who first taught him to gamble with lightning bugs. <words>220</words>
The professors, touched by this confession, carved runes into the mold’s rim that translated laughter into voltage and tears into tide charts. <words>247</words>
When the candle finally guttered, its dying flare leapt not upward but sideways, sketching a door of light on the station’s rusted wall. <words>275</words>
Ludo stepped through, clutching the empty mold, and found himself on the dock at dawn, the turbines now humming a lullaby so steady it sounded like a heartbeat. <words>306</words>
The professors were gone, but their voices lingered in the spray, repeating that every unspoken bargain leaves a fingerprint on the future. <words>335</words>
He looked into the mold and saw not wax but a single drop of phosphorescent water, pulsing like a tiny moon. <words>361</words>
Laughing with softer tears, he tipped the mold toward the sea, releasing the spark to ride the rarely predictable currents back to every bet he’d ever lost. <words>394</words>
The tide carried it beyond the horizon, and Ludo stayed on the dock, no longer gambling, simply breathing, while the station’s lights blinked like winking professors bidding him good morning. <words>450</words>
