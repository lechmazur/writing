In the exo-atmospheric garden, where oxygen grew like silver vines and stars hung low enough to bruise petals, the solitary painter drifted with a battered notepad clenched against her chest. <words>31</words>
Between borrowed books—one on zero-gravity botany, the other on the ethics of farewell—she waited for the hour when the station's lights dimmed to a candle's hush. <words>46</words>
She was fiercely gentle, the kind who could cradle a dying comet yet scorch her own palms without a sound. <words>59</words>
Tonight she would dare a final leap of faith: to resuscitate the memory of the only person who had ever seen color in her monochrome dreams. <words>75</words>
The notepad's pages fluttered like moth wings as she opened it; each sheet held hushed confessions scrawled behind stage curtains during the last touring ballet before Earth fell silent. <words>93</words>
Ink had bled through, forming nebulae of regret: I loved you in the wings, between pirouettes, when you thought no one watched. <words>108</words>
She pressed the paper to the garden's transparent dome, letting starlight illuminate the loops and tremors of that vanished hand. <words>123</words>
Realms of surprise, the botany book claimed, could bloom in vacuum if seeded with longing precise as mathematics. <words>138</words>
She tore a single sentence from the notepad—Meet me where the roses breathe vacuum—and folded it into a seedpod of engineered nightshade. <words>155</words>
Her motivation was simple: if surprise could grow, perhaps grief could wilt. <words>168</words>
She planted the folded confession beneath a sapphire rose whose roots tangled around the station's memory core. <words>183</words>
Then she waited, palette in hand, mixing pigments distilled from meteor dust and her own slow tears. <words>198</words>
Hours passed between borrowed books, the station's chronometer blinking like a hesitant pulse. <words>212</words>
The rose stirred, petals unfurling with the sound of pages turning. <words>224</words>
From its center emerged a hologram: the ballerina, barefoot in starlight, repeating the last private dance she had performed only for the painter. <words>243</words>
Intimate separation condensed around them—close enough to see the tremble of eyelashes, far enough that touch dissolved into photons. <words>261</words>
The painter lifted her brush, not to capture but to complete; she painted wings of auroras onto the hologram's shoulder blades. <words>277</words>
The dancer laughed, a sound like ice cracking into spring, and stepped backward into vacuum. <words>292</words>
Instead of dispersing, the hologram solidified into living color, the confession seed having resuscitated flesh from longing. <words>308</words>
They stood now on opposite sides of the dome, fiercely gentle, each afraid the other might vanish if approached too quickly. <words>327</words>
The painter closed the battered notepad; its final page read, in her own handwriting, Leap. <words>341</words>
She stepped through the airlock, trusting the garden's oxygen vines to braid around them both. <words>356</words>
In the hush between borrowed books, two women embraced while roses exhaled stardust. <words>371</words>
Realms of surprise, they learned, are not places but moments when grief turns its face toward light. <words>388</words>
The station drifted on, carrying its exo-atmospheric garden farther from Earth, yet closer to wherever color and dance might choose to begin again. <words>410</words>
