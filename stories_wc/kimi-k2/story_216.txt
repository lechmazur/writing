In the cloud city of Stratos, after the last library card was returned to the obsidian desk, I became the only professional scapegoat still willing to take midnight calls. <words>31</words>
My abandoned identity—once a cartographer of forbidden constellations—now lived in a drawer labeled "past selves," while I refashioned guilt into currency for the floating elite. <words>42</words>
Each cryptic phone call at midnight arrived with the obsessive calm of a metronome, the voice on the line reciting sacred symbols that only I could decode. <words>55</words>
Tonight's caller, a senator whose air-yacht had crashed into a school of wind-whales, whispered coordinates that matched the metal washer I wore on a ribbon around my neck. <words>69</words>
The washer, robustly delicate, had once sealed the oxygen line of my former life; now it dangled like a tiny halo, its etched runes glowing whenever the symbols aligned. <words>83</words>
I traced the washer's rim while the senator confessed to burning the last paper atlas, claiming the smoke spelled a prophecy I alone must interpret. <words>95</words>
Obsessive calm settled over me like stratospheric frost; I agreed to absorb his blame, but only if he mailed me the ashes—proof that my abandoned identity might still be reassembled. <words>110</words>
The call ended with a click softer than snowfall, leaving me alone in my glass apartment where the city lights flickered like uncertain stars. <words>123</words>
I opened the drawer of past selves, lifted the brittle map I once drew of uncharted jet streams, and laid the metal washer upon it; the runes pulsed, projecting ghostly sigils onto the ceiling. <words>139</words>
Each symbol rotated, rearranging into a sentence: "Return to the desk where the last card was surrendered." <words>150</words>
I refashioned my coat into a glider, stitching the washer into the hem so its weight would steer me true through the midnight updrafts. <words>163</words>
Outside, cloud towers drifted like sleeping beasts; I leapt, gliding on obsessive calm, the city’s neon veins blurring beneath me. <words>175</words>
Landing on the library’s roof, I descended the spiral of returned dreams; the desk stood empty except for a single ash-smudged card bearing my original name. <words>189</words>
The washer grew hot, burning the ribbon; I pressed it against the card, and the sacred symbols seared into my palm, completing the cipher. <words>202</words>
In that moment I understood: the guilt I carried for others was the ink rewriting my abandoned identity, each midnight call a stitch in the map back to myself. <words>216</words>
I slipped the card into my pocket, feeling the robustly delicate balance between who I had been and who I was paid to erase. <words>229</words>
The next cryptic phone call would come, but now I would answer as cartographer, not scapegoat, decoding symbols to chart a way home. <words>242</words>
