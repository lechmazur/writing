The brass-hulled submarine library drifted beneath the canal, its portholes glowing like fireflies amid the street fairs above. <words>19</words>
Practical bard Lira Windgauge pressed her ear to a copper pipe, translating the distant hurdy-gurdy into a maintenance rhythm for the engines. <words>37</words>
She carried no lute, only a toolkit slung like a bandolier, her peculiar talent being the ability to coax stories from gears and stripped screws alike. <words>57</words>
Tonight one such screw, head worn precisely imperfect, refused the screwdriver’s bite and sang instead a thin, metallic lament. <words>77</words>
Lira’s breath caught with longing; the screw’s pitch matched the forgotten chord progression of the lost Anthem of Thales, rumored to guard ancient wisdom. <words>98</words>
She traced the screw’s thread along a shelf of pressed seaweed scrolls until the melody led her to a reading alcove shaped like a nautilus. <words>119</words>
There, a brass panel sat slightly proud of its rivets, its edges scuffed in a way that felt deliberate rather than damaged. <words>139</words>
With a pick she teased the panel, revealing a hidden compartment containing a secret diary bound in sharkskin and sealed with wax the color of oxidized copper. <words>163</words>
The diary’s first line read: “To the next guardian—accept the burden before the street fairs end, or the city forgets itself.” <words>185</words>
Steam hissed overhead; above, fireworks from the fairs sparkled through the periscope like dying stars, reminding her time was short. <words>208</words>
Lira’s practical heart argued: she had repairs scheduled, quotas to meet, no official sanction to chase myths. <words>229</words>
Yet the stripped screw vibrated in her pocket, resonating with the diary’s spine until the submarine itself seemed to inhale. <words>251</words>
She flipped pages inked with coordinates, recipes for ink that sang, and warnings of a surface world preparing to burn books for fuel. <words>275</words>
The longing in her chest turned breathless; she realized the Anthem was not a song but a living archive, and only a bard who listened to machines could keep it breathing. <words>301</words>
Lira tightened the screw into a new gear, its threads now catching perfectly—yet still slightly off-key, precisely imperfect, so it would always hum the warning note. <words>328</words>
She accepted the guardianship, signing the diary with a drop of oil from her own fingertip, the submarine lights dimming in solemn witness. <words>352</words>
Above, the street fairs peaked; below, she rerouted the engines to follow the diary’s map toward deeper trenches where older libraries slept. <words>376</words>
As the last firework faded, Lira played the submarine’s pipes like a flute, weaving the Anthem into every rivet, promising the dark water that wisdom would not drown tonight. <words>404</words>
