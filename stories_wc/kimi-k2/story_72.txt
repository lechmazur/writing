The sneering envoy stepped beneath the fractured dome of the vineyard, boots crunching frostbitten vines that had once promised communion between soil and star. <words>25</words>
Across the hush of a possibility just born, he felt the rambling destiny that had dragged him to this barren alien plain tighten like a garrote of light around his throat. <words>42</words>
He carried a folded note sealed with the wax of extinct constellations, its paper trails fluttering inside his coat like caged moths remembering every betrayal they had witnessed. <words>59</words>
The greenhouse at the dome’s heart stood unlatched, glass panes veined with cracks where nebulae had tried to bloom; he entered, furiously tranquil, as though serenity itself had learned to snarl. <words>79</words>
Leaves, brittle as burnt scripture, rose in slow spirals, stirred by the exhalations of a planet that had forgotten how to breathe; he began to sift through the swirling leaves in a neglected greenhouse, searching for the rumor of a living seed. <words>104</words>
Each leaf he lifted revealed another inked fragment of the same paper trails—shipping logs, grafting charts, confessions of graft—until the air itself became a palimpsest of human hunger. <words>125</words>
He recalled the empress who had dispatched him: “Bring back whatever still drinks sunlight; cup starlight in mortal palms, or admit our empire is only a fever dream of dust.” <words>149</words>
Envy flickered beneath his sneer; he envied the vines their silence, envied the stars their distance, envied even the leaves for having once touched what he was ordered to steal. <words>172</words>
At the center of the storm of leaves he found a single vine still green, its tendrils coiled around a shard of meteoric glass that caught and refracted the alien dusk into a cradle of liquid constellations. <words>199</words>
He knelt, furiously tranquil once more, and with the reverence of a thief at a shrine he slid the folded note between the vine and the shard, letting the paper trails drink the captured starlight until the ink bled into living chlorophyll. <words>229</words>
The vine shivered, leaves unfurling like pages of a gospel no human had earned the right to read, and in their mirrored veins he saw futures branching—some where empires fell, some where gardens outlived them all. <words>258</words>
He did not sever the stem; instead he cupped the meteoric shard, now warm as a heartbeat, and felt starlight pool in his mortal palms until the weight of it rewrote the bones of his hands into something halfway luminous. <words>288</words>
Outside, the dome groaned, remembering it was broken; inside, the envoy rose, no longer entirely envoy, the rambling destiny inside him quieted by the hush of a possibility just born again. <words>320</words>
He walked out carrying the shard like a lantern, its glow printing new paper trails across the frost—promises, warnings, love letters to whatever would grow after empires forgot how to spell their own names. <words>355</words>
Behind him, the greenhouse sighed, leaves settling into the shape of a door left open for anyone else willing to sift through ruin and read the stars in the dust. <words>390</words>
