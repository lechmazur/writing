Alone on the tide-lipped boardwalk of Pearl Bay at dawn, Fen Corran—reflective harbor glazier whose fingers had fitted ten thousand panes without ever claiming the sun’s credit—tilted her lantern so its beam sliced the pearl-rinsed mist. [42]  From her palm leaked the splintered spectrum of a prism atrium encased in miniature: twelve angled panes fused so fragilely that mist itself seemed prisoner within the glass. [78]  Fen named it quietly, this palm-sized roomful of distilled color, her Noctilucent Reckoner, for it spoke only when darkness left the sky and daybreak hovered, before everything shifts. [114]  She had come to coax value out of the mundane before the ships rose on the swelling tide and the town forgot why windows mattered. [137]

Fen crouched by the still heart of the pond that mirrored the clouds. [151]  A single pebble—gathered from the harbor path, ordinary speckled granite—balanced on her knuckle. [169]  She let it speak with gravity, cast it, and the rings started widening, lapping against their own echoes. [188]  Through the patterns in the rings of the pond after a stone is thrown, she learned to commune, to read between lines that were never inked: a circle of silver, a crescent of shadow. [216]

The prism atrium caught the first thread of dawn and refracted it onto the rings, tinting them rose, vermilion, teal, so the water became parchment written on by light. [245]  Fen’s breath clouded. [249]  Clear complexity: she saw in every ripple the price of a cracked windowpane she had rescued from the scrap pile and turned into the pendant box now resting inside her coat. [285]  The memory of scrap timber and shattered glass weighed more than pebble or tide. [306]

Across the rings rose the outline of her father’s old workshop, the one demolished last season for apartments they’d promised would be affordable. [331]  Another ring, another line: her mother polishing brass till it reflected nothing but exhaustion. [353]  Ring after ring—every pane she had ever cut, scraped, set—became sentences of glass whose meaning changed depending on the mist and the angle of her gaze. [385]  She read, between lines of liquid script, the arithmetic of worth, measured not in coin but in what remains when daylight leaves the glass. [419]

A herring gull startled overhead; its wings cut a slash of white across dawn. [437]  Fen shivered but did not look away from the prism light now pooling across the pond like unclaimed daylight spilled from a pocket. [463]  The water stilled again, mirror to the sky she had always worked under yet never truly entered. [483]  In its reflection she saw herself kneeling, tool-belt empty, palms open. [498]  It struck her that a glazier was never the one who bent light but the one who held the frame so the world might. [527]  That was illumination enough. [534]

She pressed the prism atrium downward until its base kissed the water, forming the thirteenth pane: the pond itself completing the architecture. [559]  Now the spectrum spilled inward as much as outward, a room nobody could own but everyone could pass through. [583]  Fen whispered an apology to every shard she had ever swept into barrels. [603]  The tide beyond the boardwalk began to rise, lifting gulls and mooring ropes alike. [622]  Dawn was done; the day’s first ferry horn groaned across the bay. [638]  Yet she felt no urgency. [647]

She rose lighter, fingers smelling of salt and silica, and tucked the prism back into her pocket—not as keepsake, but as question. [674]  The town would keep breaking windows and she would keep refitting them, but between the breaking and the mending lay this pond-born reckoning. [705]  Fen turned from the water. [708]  Behind her, the rings faded into stillness, but she carried them folded between heartbeats like unmailed letters, each a reminder of the conversation that never ends. [752]  Pearl Bay brightened, colors shifting as sun burned off mist, and Fen walked toward the workshop, certain the ordinary awaited her, made radiant by her listening. [790]
