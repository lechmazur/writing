Dr. Mara Voss, cryptid researcher working undercover as a janitor, pushed her battered plastic tray of rakes and leaf bags through the labyrinth of broken mirrors in the abandoned research lab. <words>31</words>
It was late October, the season of leaf raking, and every shard reflected her in fractured angles, as though the building itself doubted her disguise. <words>42</words>
She had returned not for glory or proof, but to sow seeds of a better tomorrow—tiny spores of engineered moss that could eat the lab’s buried toxins and breathe out clean air. <words>55</words>
Yet the moss needed the heat signature of the creature she once hunted, the one locals called the Mirror-Eater, a being rumored to step between reflections and time. <words>68</words>
Mara set the tray down beside a scorched workbench where a single blackened candle stood, its wick curled like a question mark. <words>79</words>
She had learned, in years of hush-hush study, to excel by tracing the burn pattern in a blackened candle wick; the soot told stories of air currents, of sudden heat, of something passing that should not have mass. <words>93</words>
Tonight the trail spiraled outward, a delicate fingerprint of flame that pointed toward the west corridor where mirrors hung like guillotine blades. <words>104</words>
A soft rustle of dry leaves answered her, though no wind stirred; the leaves had blown in through shattered skylights and now arranged themselves into a perfect circle around her boots. <words>116</words>
From the circle’s center rose the Mirror-Eater—not monstrous, but fox-eyed and smiling, fur of mercury, paws that left no prints. <words>126</words>
Mara’s pulse hammered, yet she kept her voice playful, laced with mischievous wisdom: “I brought you an autumn gift, old trickster.” <words>136</words>
She lifted the tray’s false bottom, revealing packets of glowing moss. <words>142</words>
The creature tilted its head, suspiciously trusting, as though it recognized the sorrow beneath her grin. <words>151</words>
In that fateful encounter, past and future folded like tinfoil; Mara saw herself as a child watching this same lab burn, saw the Mirror-Eater saving her by pulling her reflection into safety between panes. <words>164</words>
Debt repaid, she now offered restoration. <words>168</words>
Together they walked the corridors, Mara scattering spores, the creature breathing warmth onto them so they took root in cracks of concrete and glass. <words>179</words>
Where moss touched mirror, the shards mended, showing clearer futures: children playing under trees that grew from this poisoned ground. <words>189</words>
Each healed reflection rippled outward, rewriting probability, until the lab no longer felt abandoned but expectant. <words>198</words>
Mara left her janitor’s badge on the tray, a final prop in a performance no audience would believe. <words>207</words>
Outside, dusk gathered like a conspirator; she raked the last leaves into the shape of a spiral, same as the candle’s burn. <words>217</words>
The Mirror-Eater watched from a window that now showed only sky, lifted a paw in farewell, and stepped sideways into silver. <words>227</words>
Seeds sown, debts settled, Mara walked away humming, knowing tomorrow would arrive greener than today. <words>236</words>
