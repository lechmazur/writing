The repressed poet, secretly terrified of the silence inside his own skull, stepped off the cracked boulevard and made a spontaneous decision to explore a side road where kudzu had swallowed the streetlights whole. <words>34</words>
Vines hung like green nooses above the overgrown city street reclaimed by nature, and he told himself, with knowing naivety, that beauty like this deserved a witness. <words>27</words>
In his pocket, an antique perfume bottle clinked against his keys, its glass etched with constellations no map had ever named. <words>21</words>
He had stolen it from his grandmother’s attic because the scent—dust, lilac, and something metallic—reminded him of the line he could never write: a cosmic verse on mortal skin. <words>27</words>
A rusted sign, half-buried in moss, warned of falling debris, but the poet only heard the soft percussion of his own heartbeat, loud as a pin in a silent corridor. <words>26</words>
At that exact moment, a pin did fall somewhere behind him, a bright ping that echoed off the hollow storefronts like a starter’s pistol for doubt. <words>24</words>
Lingering doubts unfolded inside him like paper birds: Was the bottle magic, or merely old? <words>15</words>
Was he brave, or only pretending? <words>6</words>
He walked faster, ivy slapping his ankles, until the street narrowed into a tunnel of trumpet vines and shattered neon. <words>18</words>
There, three shadows detached from the green—an ambush of feral children wearing crowns of bottle glass and bird bones. <words>20</words>
Their leader, a girl with eyes the color of oxidized copper, pointed a finger stained with berry juice at the antique perfume bottle. <words>21</words>
“Trade,” she said, voice soft as moss, “or we take your skin for parchment.” <words>14</words>
The poet’s throat closed around the cosmic verse he had never dared to speak aloud. <words>16</words>
With knowing naivety, he uncorked the bottle and let one drop fall onto his wrist; the scent bloomed into galaxies swirling under the thin blue map of his vein. <words>28</words>
The children stepped back, awed, as the words he had hunted for years finally arranged themselves across his forearm in indigo ink: “We are the echo of stars learning to be afraid.” <words>30</words>
He offered the girl the bottle, but she shook her head, suddenly shy, and vanished into the green with her court. <words>20</words>
Alone again, the poet pressed the wet wrist to his cheek, tasting lilac and iron, and understood that mortal skin was never meant to hold infinity—only the beautiful, terrifying attempt. <words>30</words>
Lingering doubts still fluttered, yet now they sounded like wings instead of chains. <words>14</words>
He turned back toward the boulevard, the overgrown city street already forgetting his footprints, and began to recite softly, so only the vines could hear, the first honest line he had ever written. <words>32</words>
