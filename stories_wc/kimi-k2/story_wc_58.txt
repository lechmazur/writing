The traveler arrived in the shadowed garden after the last ship sailed, carrying only a walnut ink pen and a single palace carpet weft thread she had stolen from the emperor’s summer residence. [34]  
Autumn had folded the light into bronze and rust; every leaf looked like a small, deliberate obituary. [46]  
She had spent years writing obituaries for the living, practicing the geography of healing by mapping the places people would one day cease to occupy. [66]  
Tonight she would perform the most intimate of these rites for the garden itself, which had once belonged to her vanished sister. [83]  
She knelt on the cracked marble rim of the dry fountain and pressed the weft thread between her palms until the crimson silk grew warm. [104]  
The thread had been pulled from the carpet where her sister last danced barefoot; its pattern remembered the pressure of every step. [125]  
By projecting presence through the thread, the traveler could unfold the absent woman like a letter still smelling of orange peel and thunderstorm. [148]  
She began to write, not on paper but on the air, each word a vividly descriptive lantern hung from the lowest branches. [168]  
“Here she spun until the sky unbuttoned its stars,” the traveler whispered, and a swirl of gold appeared where no leaf had turned that color before. [192]  
“Here she hid letters from a lover whose ship would never return,” and the ivy rustled with invisible envelopes. [212]  
The garden listened with lonesome splendor, shadows pooling like listening animals. [226]  
A breeze carried the scent of late quince; the traveler tasted explained absences in it, the way departure can be accounted for by wind direction and the hunger of horizons. [252]  
She wrote faster, threading memory through dusk: the sister’s laughter braided into the creak of the cedar gate, her grief soaked into the soil beneath the pomegranate. [280]  
Each sentence was a small resurrection, yet the traveler knew she was rehearsing loss rather than reversing it. [301]  
Still, understanding the geography of healing required her to chart every contour of the wound. [321]  
She laid the weft thread along the path her sister used to run at twilight; the silk glowed faintly, a vein of remembered blood. [345]  
Where it touched earth, small blue flowers opened, brief as apologies. [360]  
The traveler followed, writing: “She believed absence was a country one could sail to, so she built a boat of songs and left before the last ship sailed.” [388]  
The words drifted upward and became a flock of pale moths circling the moon. [403]  
In their flutter she saw the outline of her sister’s face, not returned but rendered, a map drawn by moonlight and moth-wing. [425]  
She reached out; the image dissolved, yet the warmth of recognition lingered on her fingertips. [443]  
The garden sighed, leaves settling like closing books. [454]  
She realized the obituary was not for her sister alone but for the part of herself that had waited on every dock for a ship already swallowed by fog. [483]  
By naming the absence, she had begun to shrink it, the way frost retreats from the first articulate sun. [504]  
She tied the weft thread around the wrist of the marble nymph at the fountain’s center, a promise that memory could be both anchor and sail. [532]  
Then she sat back on her heels and spoke aloud the final line: “May the geography of healing be a coastline we redraw together, even across the water that keeps us apart.” [569]  
The garden answered with a hush of wind, carrying the scent of quince farther than seemed possible, as if the trees themselves were sending news of her survival. [600]  
She closed her inkless pen; the words she had written hung glowing for one heartbeat more before dissolving into ordinary dusk. [626]  
Yet the thread remained, a thin red pulse against pale stone, proof that presence can be projected beyond the body’s jurisdiction. [651]  
She rose, knees stiff with cold, and walked the path once more, this time without expectation of arrival. [673]  
Behind her, the blue flowers folded into seeds, planning their own explained absence until spring. [693]  
Ahead, the harbor lamps flickered on, marking where the last ship had gone and where, perhaps, another might someday return. [717]  
The traveler tucked her empty hands into her coat pockets, feeling the shape of the pen like a ghost key. [737]  
She stepped from the garden gate into the wider night, carrying the lonesome splendor inside her like a lantern no wind could extinguish. [760]  
Somewhere between the rusted stars and the breathing sea, she
