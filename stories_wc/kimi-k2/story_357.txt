In the frost giant's lair, where icicles hung like frozen chandeliers, a focused collector named Lira sat alone at a stone table, shuffling a deck of cards with the earnest flippancy of someone who had nothing left to lose. <words>37</words>
Pinned in her journal, a black rose—pressed flat and inked with the words “For when despair wins”—served as both trophy and warning, a reminder of the alpha predator she had come to this glacial hall to defeat. <words>42</words>
She seldom spoke, and when she did, her voice carried the odd cadence of someone who had spent more time cataloging grief than greeting guests, yet tonight she waited, because the game was not hers alone. <words>42</words>
A sudden invitation to a party had arrived via raven, written in frostbite-blue ink: “Come play. One round per regret. Winner takes sorrow.” <words>27</words>
She had accepted, not for revelry, but because despair thrived on isolation, and she intended to unravel its rules like loose thread from a tapestry. <words>30</words>
The frost giant entered, each footstep a minor avalanche, and set down a board carved from whale-bone and obsidian. <words>21</words>
“First round,” he rumbled, “is Memory.” <words>7</words>
Lira placed the black rose card face-up; it matched nothing, yet everything, because despair always repeated itself. <words>20</words>
She won the round, and the giant’s eyebrow—an icicle the size of a spear—twitched in what might have been respect. <words>23</words>
Second round: Bluff. <words>3</words>
She wagered her solitude, pushing the journal forward like a shield, claiming she had never felt alone. <words>20</words>
The giant folded, unable to call a lie that rang truer than glacier-core. <words>15</words>
Third round: Chance. <words>3</words>
Dice carved from frozen tears clattered; despair rolled a pair of hollow eyes, but Lira rolled a heartbeat. <words>20</words>
The giant laughed, a sound like cracking ice, and conceded. <words>11</words>
Throughout board game rounds, the lair warmed by imperceptible degrees, frost retreating from the black rose until its petals unfurled, ink bleeding into living velvet. <words>30</words>
Despair, cornered, took the shape of a shadow with too many teeth, whispering that triumph was just another form of loss. <words>25</words>
Lira smiled, earnest and flippant, pinning the now-crimson rose back into her journal beside the words “For when despair wins—cross out wins.” <words>30</words>
She walked out of the lair alone, embracing solitude not as a cage but as a cloak tailored to her exact measure. <words>26</words>
Behind her, the giant swept the board into a box labeled “Rematches,” already missing the seldom odd girl who had beaten the house. <words>25</words>
In the starlight, Lira whispered to the rose, “Next time, we play for joy,” and the petals shimmered like laughter frozen mid-note. <words>27</words>
