The disappointed archer, bow unstrung across her back, pulled off the highway at the inverted waterfall, an unplanned stop at a roadside attraction that promised wonder yet delivered only mist rising upward into starlight. <words>37</words>
She stepped onto the bridge of regret, its planks humming anxiously calm beneath boots still dusted with the ash of failed revolutions. <words>25</words>
Above her, during the slow dance of celestial bodies, planets pirouetted like distant lovers who had forgotten why they began. <words>20</words>
She drew the tarnished silver comb from her pocket, its teeth dulled by years of chronicling social movements in snarled hair and hurried signatures on bar napkins. <words>25</words>
Each notch along the comb’s spine marked a march she had missed, a speech she had arrived too late to hear, a victory that slipped through her quiver like smoke. <words>27</words>
Tonight she had meant to drive straight past every detour, practicing passionate disinterest the way other people practiced scales, yet the sign—SEE WATER FALL UP—hooked her curiosity like a barbed arrow. <words>30</words>
At the railing she confronted her reflection suspended upside-down in the climbing cascade, droplets ascending to rejoin the river above, reversing every law she once believed immutable. <words>27</words>
She whispered to the mirrored face, “You documented their wings but never learned to fly,” the words rising with the water, refusing to fall back into her mouth. <words>25</words>
A meteor scratched a bright hyphen across the sky, and she remembered the night she chose the camera over the bow, believing images could pierce armor deeper than steel. <words>27</words>
The comb grew warm, as if the stories trapped between its teeth stirred, demanding witness. <words>16</words>
She lifted it like a microphone to the night, letting the inverted droplets drum a rhythm against the silver, a heartbeat for every protest she abandoned when the crowd thinned. <words>28</words>
On the bridge of regret, time loosened; past and future poured upward together, braiding into a single wet rope she could almost grasp. <words>22</words>
She nocked the comb like an arrow, drew it back against an invisible string, and aimed at the highest planet, a blue marble waltzing with its red partner. <words>25</words>
With passionate disinterest she released, watching the comb arc, tumbling end over end, tarnish flaking off in silver sparks that wrote brief constellations of apology across the dark. <words>29</words>
It never landed; the waterfall caught it, lifted it higher, until the comb became a new star, a small bright witness fixed forever above the bridge. <words>25</words>
The archer lowered her empty hand, feeling neither victory nor defeat, only the hush that follows when something true has finally been recorded. <words>22</words>
She turned back toward her car, bow still unstrung, heart strangely tuned, ready to chronicle the next movement without expecting to lead it. <words>24</words>
Behind her, the inverted waterfall kept singing upward, a perpetual revision of gravity, and on the bridge of regret the planks quieted, having done their duty for one more traveler. <words>30</words>
