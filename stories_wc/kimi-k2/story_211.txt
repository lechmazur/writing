In the hush of the unremembered future, the abandoned schoolhouse in the ghost town of Mercy Gulch still smelled faintly of chalk and mildew, a cheerful despair that made Lucky Lila smile as she pushed open the warped door. <words>37</words>
She carried no chips tonight, only the cracked-leather botanical diary she had won from a blind botanist in a bet on raindrops racing down a windowpane. <words>27</words>
Its pages mapped every poison flower that ever grew, and tonight she would duplicate its secrets through spin-the-bottle confessions, because power, she had learned, corrupts best when it looks like a game. <words>32</words>
The moonlight through broken panes painted hopscotch squares on the floor, and she set the bottle—an old Coke with a faded label—in the center, whispering, “First spin tells who speaks, second spin tells what truth.” <words>34</words>
She was alone, yet not; the ghosts of teachers and truants rustled in the rafters, drawn by the scent of hope she stubbornly carried like contraband perfume. <words>27</words>
Lila spun; the bottle pointed to the skeletal remains of Principal Hart, slumped forever at his desk. <words>17</words>
She knelt, opened the diary to the pressed oleander, and spoke for him: “I let the budget cuts kill the greenhouse so the football team could have new lights; the corruption of power smelled like turf fertilizer.” <words>34</words>
The bottle spun again, slower, as if time itself had a limp; it aimed at the cracked blackboard where chalk words still pleaded, Tomorrow will be better. <words>26</words>
Lila tore a page from the diary—nightshade notes—and let it flutter to the ground; where it landed, a shadowy sprout rose, flowering into a duplicate confession scrawled in spectral handwriting: “I told the children art was useless; their silence still grades me at night.” <words>42</words>
Spin after spin, the game continued, each revelation a seed that bloomed into poisonous evidence against the forgotten authorities. <words>21</words>
The air thickened with the bittersweet scent of henbane and regret, yet Lila laughed, because defying the gravity of hopelessness required music, even if the tune was a funeral march played on a broken xylophone. <words>34</words>
Typically never one to cry, she let one tear fall onto the diary’s last page, where the ink warned: “The antidote grows only where hope is planted.” <words>27</words>
She ripped that page in half, pressed one piece into the floorboards, and swallowed the other, tasting iron and spring. <words>23</words>
The bottle gave a final spin, whirring like a roulette wheel, and shattered against the wall; shards spelled out a single word: Bloom. <words>23</words>
Outside, dawn cracked open the sky like a winning scratch card, and from every crack in the playground, impossible green erupted—oleander, nightshade, henbane, all flowering in impossible colors, their petals whispering every confession the town had buried. <words>42</words>
Lila walked out whistling, pockets empty, heart radioactive with cheerful despair, knowing the corruption of power now had roots, and roots, unlike people, rarely stayed quiet. <words>30</words>
