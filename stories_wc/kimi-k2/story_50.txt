The unconvinced missionary walked the glass desert alone, boots crunching on crystalline sand that reflected his doubt like a thousand tiny mirrors. <words>21</words>
In his pocket, a tarnished silver fork clinked against his rosary, both equally useless for the hunger gnawing at his soul. <words>34</words>
The last monarch butterfly drifted past, orange wings beating against the sterile horizon, and he followed its capriciously consistent path toward the abandoned piano half-buried in silica. <words>52</words>
Each step tested his faith further, the butterfly's migration a mockery of divine order in this place where nothing should live. <words>67</words>
He had come to the glass desert to become a conduit for magic, to prove that God's grace could flow even through a doubting vessel. <words>85</words>
Instead, he found only the piano's corpse, keys yellowed like old teeth, strings rusted into discordant monuments to failed music. <words>103</words>
The butterfly landed on the highest key, and when the wind struck the untuned strings, echoes spilled out like broken prayers. <words>120</words>
He pressed the tarnished silver fork against his lips, tasting metal and memory, then began to decode patterns in the piano's dying voice. <words>138</words>
Three notes high, two low, a pause—conceal, the music whispered, conceal what you seek beneath what you've lost. <words>155</words>
The missionary's fingers found the fork's tines could pluck individual strings, drawing forth messages only the desperate could hear. <words>173</words>
Each echo mapped the desert's hidden veins of power, ley lines pulsing beneath glass like blood beneath skin. <words>189</words>
The butterfly danced between notes, its migration route spelling ancient symbols in the air, and he traced them with the fork's silver tip. <words>207</words>
Alone intimacy wrapped around him like a shroud as he realized the magic didn't come from God or gods, but from the space between belief and unbelief. <words>227</words>
The piano's final chord shattered into crystalline dust, revealing a pool of liquid starlight where the butterfly drank. <words>244</words>
He plunged the tarnished silver fork into the pool, watching it transform into pure light that raced up his arm like fire. <words>262</words>
The glass desert sang then, every shard harmonizing with the fork's new frequency, and the missionary understood his doubt was the key. <words>281</words>
To become a conduit for magic, one must first be hollow enough to carry it, and his tested faith had carved him empty as a reed. <words>300</words>
The last monarch butterfly dissolved into orange sparks that settled on his shoulders like blessing or burden—he could no longer tell the difference. <words>321</words>
He walked back across the singing glass, fork glowing in his pocket, carrying the desert's magic and his own unbelief in equal measure. <words>341</words>
Behind him, the piano's skeleton crumbled into sand, its final message complete: some migrations end not in arrival, but in transformation. <words>361</words>
The unconvinced missionary smiled for the first time in years, his footsteps leaving trails of light that spelled questions only the butterfly would ever answer. <words>380</words>
