The weary undertaker stepped through the moonlit arch of the ancient Persian palace reimagined, its turquoise tiles still humming with the hush after a car backfires in a silent street. <words>31</words>
He carried no corpse tonight, only the weight of a tribal knowledge passed from father to son: the astronomical clock hidden beneath the throne room could imprison death itself by following sun paths. <words>37</words>
For generations his line had served the dead, yet this lore—rarely practical, always whispered—promised a darker mercy: to cage the reaper and hold onto hope in the absolute dark. <words>34</words>
Dust rose like incense as he crossed the cracked lapis floor, each footfall a soft drumbeat of placid ferocity. <words>22</words>
He remembered his daughter’s last breath, the way her small fingers had loosened like petals at dusk, and the promise he had murmured: not again. <words>30</words>
The clock waited beneath a trapdoor of cedar and brass, its gears etched with constellations that pre-dated Cyrus. <words>20</words>
He knelt, palms open, letting moonlight pool in the lifelines that had closed a thousand eyes. <words>18</words>
Tribal knowledge spoke of a single moment—when the sun’s ghost reflection slid across the mirrored quadrant—when the mechanism could be turned backward, locking death outside time. <words>34</words>
He set his chisel to the first gear, following sun paths drawn in gold leaf across the marble, each angle precise, each breath measured. <words>26</words>
The palace held its breath with him; even the wind withdrew, as if the world itself feared what mercy might cost. <words>23</words>
Gears groaned like old bones, then clicked into alignment; a low hum rose, neither song nor scream, but the sound of something vast being caged. <words>28</words>
Shadows lengthened unnaturally, curling around the columns like black vines seeking cracks. <words>16</words>
The undertaker did not flinch; his ferocity was quiet, a tide that wore cliffs to sand. <words>18</words>
At the final turn, the mirrored quadrant flared, swallowing every shard of light, and for one heartbeat the palace became the absolute dark he had bargained for. <words>31</words>
In that blindness he felt the presence withdraw—death, imprisoned by its own compass, pacing behind walls of burning noon. <words>25</words>
When vision returned, dawn was already leaking through the shattered dome, gilding the dust that danced above the silent gears. <words>24</words>
The weary undertaker rose, knees trembling, and pressed his forehead to the warm marble. <words>17</words>
He had stolen nothing; he had only redirected the river, knowing the flood would come again, yet for now the world could breathe. <words>28</words>
Outside, the street remained silent, but somewhere a child laughed, bright as breaking glass, and he allowed himself one tear—salt, proof, and fragile hope. <words>29</words>
