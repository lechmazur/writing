The cynic, cursed to speak only truth, stood amid bird watching at the haunted amusement park prize booth, where layered tranquility hung like dust on forgotten plush toys. <words>25</words>
He clutched a vintage pencil box, its lacquer cracked like old laughter, and felt the politely vindictive moon beginning its slow petrify through the phases above the rusted carousel. <words>34</words>
Inside the box lay a tapestry of fate no larger than a postcard, woven from silver thread that shifted whenever someone lied within earshot. <words>44</words>
Tonight the tapestry showed a single motionless sparrow, wings pinned mid-flutter, and the cynic knew the mind he must provoke evolution in belonged to the park’s lone security guard, a man who had not changed his route in twenty-three years. <words>59</words>
The guard approached, flashlight bobbing like a tired firefly, and the cynic greeted him with the only words the curse allowed: “You will die in this booth, unmourned, unless you learn to move.” <words>71</words>
The guard flinched, but the cynic’s tone was soft, almost kind, the insult cushioned by layered tranquility. <words>80</words>
He opened the vintage pencil box; the tapestry fluttered, threads rearranging into the guard’s silhouette standing forever beside the cotton-candy machine. <words>91</words>
The moon slipped from waxing gibbous toward full, its politely vindictive light beginning to petrify the guard’s boots to the cracked linoleum. <words>102</words>
Birds the guard had never noticed—nightjars, nighthawks—wheeled overhead, their cries urging him to evolve or ossify. <words>112</words>
The cynic spoke again, compelled by the curse: “Every night you count the same stuffed giraffes; tonight count the stars instead.” <words>123</words>
The tapestry shimmered; the sparrow twitched, one wing lifting. <words>130</words>
The guard’s gaze followed the cynic’s finger upward, past the torn awning, past the skeletal Ferris wheel, to the sky where constellations rearranged themselves into unfamiliar maps. <words>143</words>
His right foot tore free with a sound like ripping Velcro, the petrify reversing as the moon reached fullness and began to wane. <words>154</words>
The cynic smiled—a rare event—because the curse forced him to add, “You will still die, but now it will be somewhere else, and someone will notice.” <words>167</words>
The guard laughed, the sound rusty yet genuine, and accepted the vintage pencil box as a parting gift. <words>177</words>
Inside, the tapestry now showed the sparrow in flight, heading toward a horizon the guard had never imagined. <words>188</words>
The cynic walked away, mission accomplished, the moon politely vindictive no longer, merely luminous. <words>199</words>
Behind him, the haunted amusement park prize booth began to crumble, its stagnation no longer tenable. <words>210</words>
Birds settled on the collapsing roof, watching the guard stride toward the exit, his mind finally in motion. <words>221</words>
The cynic whispered to the night air, uncursed for one breath: “Evolution is the only honest miracle.” <words>232</words>
The tapestry in the guard’s pocket fluttered once more, threads rearranging into the shape of a man learning to fly. <words>244</words>
