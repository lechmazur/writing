Snow sifted through the cracked dome of the run-down opera house, settling on velvet seats that had once held captains and dreamers alike. <words>25</words>
The mute courier stepped across the warped stage, boots silent, coat heavy with salt and secrecy. <words>37</words>
In the pocket over his heart rested the pocket guide to interdimensional travel, its leather cover warm as breath against the storm battering the harbor outside. <words>54</words>
He had carried it for seven winters, never opening it, letting its presence alone generate questions he could not speak aloud. <words>69</words>
Tonight, though, the comet returned, the same icy wanderer that had streaked above the night he lost his voice, and its pale fire pressed against the broken skylight like a finger urging him on. <words>90</words>
He knelt where the orchestra pit had been, brushing snow from a trapdoor whose hinges sighed open with cautious enchantment. <words>106</words>
Below, the air tasted of forgotten arias and rust; a single lantern still burned, fed by some unassumingly bold caretaker who refused to let the place die. <words>126</words>
The courier descended, lantern in one hand, guide in the other, following footprints already filling with white. <words>141</words>
At the center of the flooded cellar, water black as ink reflected both the comet and the cracked ceiling of his own mind. <words>158</words>
He opened the guide for the first time; pages fluttered like startled doves, revealing maps drawn in fading silver ink that rearranged themselves under falling snowflakes. <words>180</words>
Each map was a corridor of thought, a possible escape from the weight of words he had never been allowed to say. <words>198</words>
The comet’s light funneled through the dome, striking the water, and the cellar began to revolve, slow as a waltz remembered in winter. <words>218</words>
Ripples became doorways; each doorway hummed with a different silence, sweeter than any applause. <words>233</words>
He stepped toward the nearest threshold, but the guide tugged back, pages folding into the shape of a throat, reminding him that escape is not the same as erasure. <words>255</words>
He pressed the paper throat to his own; warmth spread, and for the first time since childhood he felt syllables forming without sound. <words>275</words>
The comet dipped lower, its tail brushing the harbor’s masts, and the opera house answered with a chord struck from every broken window. <words>295</words>
Snowflakes turned to notes, spelling out the hidden meanings he had crossed oceans to find: memory is a harbor, loss is a tide, and the mind’s escape is the courage to stay. <words>323</words>
He closed the guide, slipped it back into his pocket, and turned away from the shimmering doors. <words>340</words>
Ascending the stairs, he left wet footprints that spelled a single word only the comet could read: “Listen.” <words>358</words>
Back on the stage, he stood beneath the open sky, letting snow settle on his tongue like a promise. <words>378</words>
The storm quieted; the comet dimmed; the opera house held its breath. <words>392</words>
In the hush, the courier lifted his hand, palm open, and the caretaker’s lantern flickered once in reply, a small, unassumingly bold beacon against the vast returning dark. <words>415</words>
