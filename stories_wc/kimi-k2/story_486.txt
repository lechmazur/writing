In the witch's cauldron room, where the hush of a freshly erased chalkboard still clung to the air like a held breath, sound engineer Mireille adjusted her headphones with clumsily dexterous fingers. <words>34</words>
She held a single stained glass fragment to the candlelight, its fractured blues and reds refracting across the copper kettles like silent retribution made visible. <words>27</words>
The fragment had once belonged to the cathedral's rose window, shattered last week when the mayor's unstoppable crowd cheered too loudly for her brother's execution. <words>25</words>
Now she would hush that roar forever, not with violence, but with practical illusion. <words>15</words>
Mireille's gift was subtle: she could bend sound the way glassbenders shape molten sand, turning cheers into whispers, truth into rumor. <words>22</words>
Tonight she would critique the crowd's bloodlust through pantomime confessions in public squares, each gesture amplified by her engineered silence until their guilt became deafening. <words>26</words>
She ground the fragment into powder, mixing it with powdered chalk from the erased board—the residue of spells uncast, words unsaid. <words>23</words>
The mixture sizzled in the smallest cauldron, releasing threads of colored smoke that spelled out confessions only the guilty could read. <words>22</words>
Mireille rehearsed her pantomime: hands clasped as if in prayer, then opening to reveal empty palms—innocence turned inside out. <words>22</words>
She would perform this at dawn in the square where they'd cheered, her silence creating pockets where each person would hear their own heartbeat as accusation. <words>26</words>
The practical illusion wasn't in what people saw, but in what they suddenly couldn't un-hear: the absence of their own justification. <words>23</words>
As the potion cooled, she tested it, releasing a bubble of pure silence that made the cauldron's usual bubbling seem obscene. <words>22</words>
Tomorrow, when the mayor spoke to the crowd again, her silent retribution would unfold—each cheer caught in their throats like shards of colored glass. <words>25</words>
She practiced her clumsy dexterity one final time, nearly dropping the vial before securing it in her pocket with deliberate care. <words>23</words>
The chalkboard's erased surface reflected her face, fractured by the cauldron's curved copper like another stained glass window, another broken thing made whole through purpose. <words>29</words>
Mireille smiled, knowing that true silence wasn't absence but transformation—the crowd would critique themselves through her pantomime, their roar becoming the hush of understanding. <words>30</words>
She left the witch's room as the first light touched the chalkboard, carrying her practical illusion like a prayer whispered backwards, ready to make the unstoppable crowd finally stop and listen to their own hearts' guilty rhythm. <words>38</words>
