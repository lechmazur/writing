Lord Percival Thistlewaite knelt obediently in the secret agent workshop, polishing a dull letter opener while gardeners noisily trimmed hedges outside. <words>21</words>
His unusually perceptive ears caught fragments drifting through the echo chambers hidden behind the tool racks, where two handlers discussed "disposing of the subject before extraction." <words>28</words>
Percival, ever the submissive aristocrat, pretended to buff harder, but his heart liquified at the thought of the trembling pygmy sloth they'd caged for biometric trials. <words>25</words>
Through unplanned eavesdropping in echo chambers disguised as ventilation shafts, he learned the creature would be "liquefied for easier transport" at dusk. <words>24</words>
Amid yard work clamor—leaf blowers, shears, shouted instructions—he plotted with earnest flippancy, twirling the dull letter opener like a toy sword. <words>24</words>
Silent empathy guided him; he sensed the sloth's slow heartbeat syncing with his own, a mute plea wrapped in moss-green fur. <words>23</words>
He bowed when Agent Morgana strode past, then slipped into the corridor, soles silent on the rubberized floor. <words>19</words>
The workshop smelled of oil, ozone, and fear; cages lined the far wall like forgotten library stacks. <words>18</words>
Percival located the sloth, no bigger than a teapot, clinging to bars with miniature claws. <words>17</words>
He whispered, "Hold tight, old sport," and inserted the dull letter opener between lock and latch, leveraging centuries of aristocratic lock-picking lessons. <words>25</words>
The mechanism clicked; the door swung; the sloth blinked once, twice, then crawled onto his cravat as if it were a branch. <words>24</words>
Footsteps echoed; Percival tucked the creature inside his waistcoat, heart hammering louder than the leaf blowers outside. <words>22</words>
He strode back into the workshop, adopting the vacant smile of a man who lived to serve, and offered to fetch afternoon tea for the entire surveillance team. <words>27</words>
They waved him off, too busy calibrating scanners to notice the gentle bulge at his chest. <words>19</words>
Outside, amid yard work chaos, he knelt again, this time beside the compost heap, and set the sloth on a camellia branch. <words>23</words>
It regarded him with liquid eyes, then began its unhurried climb toward sunlight. <words>16</words>
Percival straightened, brushed mulch from his knees, and returned to the workshop humming, the dull letter opener now gleaming with purpose rather than polish. <words>26</words>
No one ever connected the missing specimen to the soft-spoken lord who poured their tea and bowed at every command. <words>23</words>
Yet each evening, when the estate grew quiet, he visited the garden wall where a tiny shadow dropped leaves on his shoulder in wordless gratitude. <words>28</words>
And though he remained the most submissive aristocrat in the service, his unusually perceptive ears now listened for any plan that might threaten the vulnerable, ready to liquify with compassion and act with earnest flippancy once more. <words>38</words>
