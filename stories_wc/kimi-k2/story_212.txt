<story>
The apocalyptic farmer knelt among the brittle stalks of his last viable crop, humming the song of boundaries that his mother swore kept the wind from stealing seed. <words>29</words>
On the ethereal plains, where the sky hung like torn silk and the soil remembered every bullet of the last resource war, he bred new seeds that glowed faintly, typically atypical children of radiation and prayer. <words>42</words>
Each dawn he jabbered to them, nonsense syllables that felt like lullabies, believing plants understood desperation better than people ever had. <words>55</words>
Between rows he carried a magician’s deck of trick cards, edges scorched, faces faded to ghosts; he shuffled them for courage, drawing the same card every time—the joker with no mouth. <words>75</words>
The card reminded him of the silence imposed by the Council of Ration, whose edicts still ruled though their cities lay hollow; he wanted to escape a life dictated by another, even if that other was long dead. <words>97</words>
So he wrote tiny pleas on rice paper, rolled them tight, and sealed them inside bottles scavenged from the poisoned tide, sending his crimes and hopes through the messages in a bottle carried by the sea. <words>123</words>
He imagined the bottles bobbing past rusted warships, past whales grown translucent, until they reached some shore where children might plant his glowing seeds and sing their own raw solace. <words>149</words>
One evening a bottle returned, unbroken, corked with wax the color of moonlight; inside lay a single playing card—the queen of spades, her eyes scratched out, and a note: “We hear the song too.” <words>183</words>
The farmer’s hands shook as he pressed the queen into the earth beside a trembling sprout; overnight the plant grew tall, leaves unfurling like dark flags, roots humming the same boundary tune in deeper keys. <words>219</words>
He understood then that the song was not a shield but a door; he packed the remaining seeds, the joker, and the queen, and walked west where the plains dissolved into violet mist. <words>254</words>
Behind him the abandoned field kept singing, a low vibration that cracked the dry ground open, releasing steam scented with wet cedar—memory of forests before war. <words>292</words>
He walked until the magician’s deck grew warm against his chest; he drew another card and this time it was blank, ready for whatever name he chose to give the horizon. <words>330</words>
At the edge of the ethereal plains he found the sea, black and shining like obsidian glass; he waded knee-deep and released the last bottle, watching it float until it became a star. <words>375</words>
Then he planted a single glowing seed in the wet sand, whispering the song of boundaries one final time, letting it fracture into silence that felt like beginning. <words>415</words>
The tide answered with a hush, and the farmer, free at last, lay down beside his newborn sprout, listening to the earth learn how not to obey. <words>450</words>
