The surly watchman, Garrick, paced the sailor's graveyard between seasons, when tides of mist rolled over tilted stones like ghostly waves. <words>21</words>
He clutched a short piece of yarn—once red, now rust—tied by his grandmother to remind him that even frayed things hold memory. <words>31</words>
Between the equinox and solstice, the place felt serenely frantic: gulls screamed lullabies while wind chimes of broken rigging kept perfect, mournful time. <words>44</words>
Garrick’s duty was to guard the dead, yet his true motivation was to understand cosmic patterns hidden in barnacle-scrawled epitaphs and salt-stung stars. <words>58</words>
Tonight, a merchant appeared among the graves, lantern swinging like a pendulum, offering market wisdom in exchange for safe passage through the iron gate. <words>72</words>
“Every price,” the merchant rasped, “is a riddle; solve it, and the universe tilts a penny in your favor.” <words>84</words>
Garrick snarled, but curiosity overruled surliness; he knelt, pressed the yarn into the merchant’s palm, and demanded the craft behind such riddles. <words>98</words>
The merchant taught him knot divination, a traditional craft learned from an elder who traded in storms: tie seven knots, speak a question, untie one each dawn until the answer arrives on the tide. <words>116</words>
Together they knelt between leaning markers, fingers weaving dignified chaos—yarn looping through names of drowned captains like sutras through prayer wheels. <words>131</words>
With each knot Garrick whispered a fear: of horizons that never end, of stars that forget their courses, of his own heart calcifying like coral. <words>145</words>
The merchant left at moonset; Garrick remained, serenely frantic, counting heartbeats against the slap of waves on hulls that would never sail again. <words>159</words>
Seven dawns passed; six knots loosened, carrying away anger, regret, the weight of unmarked graves. <words>171</words>
On the seventh morning, fog peeled back to reveal a pattern of shells arranged by tide—spirals within spirals, a cosmic fingerprint. <words>185</words>
Garrick understood: the market of fate barters in attention; pay with wonder, receive direction. <words>197</words>
He retied the final knot into a bracelet for the wrist that once shook a spear at shadows, feeling the yarn pulse like a tiny vein linking him to every drowned navigator. <words>213</words>
Storms returned, seasons shifted, yet the sailor's graveyard remained his chapel of charts where headstones became sextants and grief became compass. <words>227</words>
Sailors’ widows now bring him scraps of their lovers’ sleeves; he knots their questions, releases them on outgoing tides, keeper and keeper-of in dignified, chaotic balance. <words>244</words>
Word spreads that the surly watchman can read futures in frayed thread, but Garrick only smiles, guarding the gate, guarding the graves, guarding the riddle that keeps the cosmos turning. <words>260</words>
