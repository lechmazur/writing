The tower fell at dawn, its iron spine snapping like a dried reed, and the shockwave rolled across the dunes until it lapped against the glass dome that sheltered the desert rose farm. [38]
Inside, Lila pressed her palm to the trembling pane, feeling the engraved quiet of the morning fracture into splinters of distant screams and collapsing stone. [55]
She was the bounty hunter's pacifist daughter, raised on stories of capture and mercy, and now those stories felt as hollow as the tower's vanished silhouette. [74]
Her father had chased ghosts across the sky; she chased continuity through chaos, believing that if one petal survived the blast, memory could still root. [94]
The roses themselves, crimson as cooling embers, grew from sandbags once used to ballast airships—canvas husks now slit open, their ballast sandbag scrap mingling with the engineered soil that fed each thorn. [118]
She knelt, lifted a shard of canvas no larger than her thumb, and read the faded stencil: “Property of the Zephyr Fleet—Handle with Care.” [139]
Care, she thought, was a word the world had forgotten when the tower fell. [152]
Yet the roses had not forgotten; they drank the quiet engraved into every grain of sand, blooming in a tranquil blaze that made the dome feel like the inside of a lantern. [175]
Lila’s senses, senselessly perceptive, caught the shift in humidity before the automatic misters hissed, heard the fracture propagating through a single pane on the eastern quadrant, smelled the iron-blood scent of panic riding the wind. [205]
She moved along the rows, fingers brushing leaves, inculcating plants with values the way her father once loaded cartridges: patience into the rootstock, forgiveness into the buds, remembrance into the scent that would drift out when the dome finally cracked. [240]
Each whispered lesson was a sheathe against the coming storm, a way to slide the blade of tomorrow into a scabbard of yesterday without drawing blood. [264]
Outside, scavenger skiffs already circled like vultures, their engines coughing blue fire. [279]
She imagined her father among them, rifle slung low, debating whether to bring her in for the price on pacifists who refused to choose sides. [302]
The thought stung less than it should; continuity, she reminded herself, was not the same as loyalty. [318]
She carried the canvas scrap to the center of the dome, where the oldest rose, a gnarled patriarch with petals like burnt parchment, stood sentinel. [344]
There she buried the fragment beneath its roots, pressing sand around it as if tucking a child into bed. [364]
“Grow the memory,” she murmured, “grow the quiet.” [375]
The dome lights flickered, then steadied, powered by the geothermal heart that had survived the tower’s demise. [393]
In that steady glow the roses shimmered, and for a moment the enclosure felt larger than the desert, a pocket universe where every thorn was a promise and every bloom a treaty. [420]
A boom rattled the glass—another tower, or perhaps the same one finishing its collapse. [437]
Dust clouds rose like dark wings, but inside the tranquil blaze held. [450]
Lila resumed her rounds, grafting cuttings with the same deliberate calm her father once showed when cleaning his revolver. [475]
She spoke to the plants of mornings before the tower, of markets where roses were traded for water and stories, of children who believed the sky was a garden. [505]
The roses listened, or seemed to, their leaves tilting toward her voice the way sunflowers track the sun. [525]
When the first scavenger pried open the service hatch, she did not reach for a weapon; instead she lifted a single perfect bloom and offered it like a flag of ceasefire. [555]
The intruder, a boy no older than she had been when her father first left, stared at the flower, then at the rows of crimson, then at the sandbag soil that cradled them. [580]
In his eyes she saw the same fracture she felt the moment the tower fell, and she knew continuity could travel by scent as well as by blood. [605]
She placed the rose in his trembling hand, petals brushing skin like a whispered oath. [622]
“Take it,” she said, “and tell them the quiet still grows.” [635]
He fled, clutching the bloom, and the dome sighed, a single pane cracking in a spiderweb pattern that caught the light like frost. [656]
Lila traced the fracture, feeling the engraved quiet shift into something new—not silence, but a listening. [674]
She returned to the patriarch rose, pressed her ear to its stem, and heard the slow pulse of sap
