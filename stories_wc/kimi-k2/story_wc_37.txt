The scattered memory keeper pressed her palm against the mica window, its thin sheets flaking like fish scales under her skin. [21]
Beyond the pane, the alchemical orchard greenhouse stretched into endless night, each tree a black silhouette against darker black, fruit glowing faintly with the last embers of a dying realm. [42]
She had once known every branch by name, but the mirror world had begun to forget itself, and so had she. [60]
In her pocket rested a spool of thread spun from woven dawns, pale gold fibers that still hummed with the warmth of forgotten mornings. [82]
She had gathered them one by one, stealing seconds of sunrise from dreams no one else remembered, knotting them together until they could swaddle a whole village in light. [110]
Tonight she would try to swaddle the orchard itself, to knit communities together before the final frost arrived. [132]
She stepped inside; the air tasted of iron and lullabies. [145]
The trees leaned toward her, bark etched with runes that spelled out lullabies in languages that had never been spoken aloud. [168]
She touched a low branch and felt the pulse of a heart that was not hers, a rhythm asking to be remembered. [189]
From her coat she drew the first length of woven dawn and began to sing, not with her voice but with the forgotten songs her grandmother had hummed while shelling beans, songs that carried maps of where every root had once reached. [226]
The melody slipped between the leaves like wind, coaxing the mica window to brighten, its surface reflecting not the greenhouse but the orchard as it had been: silver leaves catching real sun, children chasing fireflies that were actually tiny phoenixes reborn each dusk. [275]
Each note was a stitch, binding trunk to trunk, grafting memory onto bark until the scattered memory keeper could feel the orchard breathing in unison. [305]
Yet the night pushed back, hungry, unraveling her song faster than she could weave it. [325]
She knelt, pressed her forehead to the soil, and whispered the name of the first peach she ever tasted, letting the sweetness flood back into the ground. [358]
The earth answered with a tremor; a single blossom opened, white as moonlight, perfumed with the hour her mother taught her to braid grass into crowns. [390]
She wrapped the blossom gently in a strip of dawn, swaddling it like an infant, and tied it to the lowest limb. [415]
The act felt like bound release, sorrow and joy braided so tightly they became the same thread. [437]
More blossoms followed, each one a memory she had salvaged from the cracks between sleeping and waking: the laughter of the baker whose hands smelled of cardamom, the shy smile of the ferryman who carried lovers across the mirrored river, the hush that fell when the eclipse taught everyone to listen. [507]
The greenhouse brightened degree by degree, mica panes turning rose, then gold, then unbearably white. [530]
Still, the scattered memory keeper sang, voice cracking, because the realm was not yet saved, only reminded of what it was about to lose. [560]
She climbed the central tree, feet finding holds she had carved as a child, until she stood level with the roof. [588]
There she unrolled the last length of woven dawn, a tapestry wide enough to cover the sky. [612]
She sang the final forgotten song, the one without words, only breath shaped into the sound of morning sliding across water. [645]
The tapestry rose, billowed, and settled over the greenhouse like a mother tucking in a fevered child. [670]
Night peeled away in strips, revealing the mirror world’s true sky, pale and trembling, but alive. [695]
The scattered memory keeper closed her eyes, felt her memories scatter again, lighter now, seeds on new wind. [720]
She smiled, knowing the orchard would remember for her, would knit communities together with the fruit of woven dawns, and that somewhere, in some other mirror, a child would taste a peach and remember her name. [770]
