In the gas-lit Victorian parlor stranded like a misplaced chess piece within the breathing green of the jungle, Reverend Thaddeus Grimble studied his Latin conjugations while a gecko clicked Morse against the wainscot. <words>37</words>
He was an unhinged zealot who believed every comma in the Vulgate concealed a divine wink, and tonight the comma was between “vincit” and “omnia,” a pause he felt might uproot the entire order of sin. <words>47</words>
Between conjugations he rolled a plain metal bottle cap—pried from a missionary’s tonic—across the mahogany table, its tin scratch sounding like a theoretically playful giggle that refused to confess its joke. <words>42</words>
The cap had arrived that morning beneath the door with no note, only the unspoken agreement that whoever possessed it at midnight would trade their strongest certainty for their weakest doubt. <words>38</words>
Grimble, craving strength in vulnerability, had whispered back through the keyhole, “Accepted,” sealing the covenant without ink or witness. <words>26</words>
Now, at eleven fifty-seven, the jungle pressed its humid palms against the parlor windows, and the Reverend’s candle guttered like a nervous acolyte. <words>29</words>
He closed the lexicon, the room dimming to a dark room of amber shadow, and began the whispered confession the cap required: “I fear the comma is only a comma, and I am only a frightened man.” <words>42</words>
The bottle cap leapt from the table, spinning mid-air, and the floorboards buckled as if something vast below tried to uproot the parlor itself. <words>32</words>
Books slid from shelves, the gecko fled, and Grimble clutched the cap to his chest, feeling its tin warmth pulse like a tiny heart. <words>29</words>
In that earnest absurdity, the walls peeled away like wet wallpaper, revealing lianas threaded through organ pipes, and the jungle poured in, perfumed with orchids and sulfur. <words>31</words>
The Reverend laughed—half hymn, half hiccup—because the unspoken agreement had not lied: his certainty in punctuation collapsed, yet in its place rose a trembling wonder that felt stronger than granite dogma. <words>38</words>
He set the cap atop a fern frond where it glinted like a miniature halo, then knelt among the roots now carpeting the parquet, pressing his forehead to the cool soil. <words>35</words>
“Take my Latin,” he murmured, “take my zeal, but leave me this shaking openness.” <words>19</words>
The jungle answered with a hush, the uprooting ceased, and the parlor settled crookedly back around him, vines draping the chaise like repentant curtains. <words>31</words>
Reverend Grimble rose, lighter by the weight of one comma, and resumed studying—not conjugations now, but the cap’s reflection of candlelight, a round silent scripture that said everything he had never dared speak aloud. <words>42</words>
