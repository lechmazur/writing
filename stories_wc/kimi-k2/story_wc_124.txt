The wistful lantern broker, Elian, stepped through the arch of the greenhouse for extinct plants as the transformation completed, the last petal of the ghost orchid folding into silver light. [34]  
He carried no lantern tonight; instead, he cradled a crystal perfume vial no larger than a sparrow’s heart, its facets catching the moon in crystal shadows. [50]  
Inside the vial drifted a single drop of fragrance distilled from the final bloom of a vanished midnight cereus, and he was aromatically cautious, afraid that one careless breath might loose the memory it carried. [70]  
The greenhouse sighed around him, glass panes sweating violet dew, while ultraviolet revealing lamps flickered on, coaxing phosphorescent veins from leaves that had not existed for a hundred years. [90]  
Each pulse of violet showed Elian the spectral outlines of plants he once sold as living lanterns—flora that glowed when loved, dimmed when forgotten—now reduced to pressed grief between sheets of time. [110]  
He had come to understand why some smells trigger tears, because every scent he brokered was a promise that someone would remember, and tonight the promise had turned on him. [130]  
The crystal perfume vial warmed against his palm, releasing a ribbon of fragrance so delicate it felt like the exhale of a sleeping child. [148]  
Instantly the greenhouse shifted: the ultraviolet revealing lamps dimmed, and in their place rose memories of his mother bending over night-blooming jasmine, her hands guiding his child fingers to cup the luminous petals. [170]  
He grieved then, not with sound, but with the slow collapse of his shoulders, as if grief were a greenhouse pane fracturing under its own weight. [188]  
The scent deepened, layering green sap over distant thunder, and Elian saw himself years ago, trading living lanterns for coin, believing memory could be bought and sold like spices. [208]  
He pressed the crystal perfume vial to his lips, tasting the bitterness of regret, and understood that every fragrance he had brokered had been a seed planted in strangers’ hearts, growing into gardens he could never enter. [230]  
The greenhouse for extinct plants trembled, glass singing in crystal shadows, as the ultraviolet revealing lamps surged again, showing him the final truth: the midnight cereus had not vanished; it had transformed into the very scent he carried. [255]  
Elian’s motivation crystallized—he had not come to sell but to return, to release the last memory back to the soil that first grew it. [275]  
He knelt among the phosphorescent leaves, uncorked the crystal perfume vial, and let the drop fall. [290]  
The fragrance burst outward like a silent bell, and every extinct plant in the greenhouse straightened, drinking the memory through invisible roots. [310]  
For a moment the air was thick with every scent he had ever brokered—orange peel laughter, cedar grief, rain on a lover’s collar—and Elian breathed them all, aromatically cautious no longer. [335]  
Tears slid down his cheeks, tasting of salt and night-blooming jasmine, as he grieved not for the plants but for the selves he had been while selling their memories. [355]  
The ultraviolet revealing lamps dimmed to embers, and in the hush the greenhouse began to glow from within, each leaf a lantern rekindled. [375]  
Elian stayed until dawn, watching the extinct plants unfurl new petals that shimmered like moonlit glass, their fragrance no longer a commodity but a living elegy. [395]  
When the sun finally breached the crystal shadows, he left the greenhouse empty-handed, the crystal perfume vial now a clear shell, its purpose fulfilled. [415]  
He stepped into the morning air lighter, as if the weight of every sold memory had evaporated with the night’s last tear. [435]  
Yet the scent lingered on his skin, a quiet reminder that understanding why some smells trigger tears does not stop the tears; it only teaches them where to go. [455]  
Years later, travelers speak of a wistful lantern broker who wanders from city to city, no longer selling light but planting gardens of remembrance in forgotten corners. [475]  
They say he carries an empty crystal perfume vial tied around his neck, its facets catching the sun in crystal shadows, and when asked why he keeps it, he smiles, aromatically cautious once more, and answers, “To remind me that every scent is a seed, and every tear is rain.” [505]  
In the greenhouse for extinct plants, the midnight cereus blooms again each night, its fragrance drifting through the open roof, searching for the one who set it free. [525]  
Sometimes, when the ultraviolet revealing stars align, the petals glow violet, and those who breathe
