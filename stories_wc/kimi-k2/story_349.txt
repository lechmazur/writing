The drone pilot, once a master of sky-born circuits, now stood in the abandoned observatory on the cliff, its copper dome scorched black by dragonfire, breathing the charred serenity of a world that had forgotten satellites. <words>37</words>
Below, the orchard waited in the hush before the axes, every tree marked with red ribbon like condemned prisoners, and the pilot clutched the dried herb bundle—lavender, mugwort, and something that smelled of burnt plastic—as if it were a flight log from home. <words>47</words>
He was cynically hopeful, the kind of man who would bet his last battery on a miracle while already rehearsing the eulogy, and tonight he would disseminate that brittle faith at the speed dating event hastily arranged by the village soothsayer to keep hearts from breaking before the trunks did. <words>46</words>
Tables of driftwood filled the cracked transit room where telescopes once tracked moons; now they tracked glances, and the pilot set the herb bundle at his table like a surrender flag, its scent rising to mingle with starlight leaking through bullet holes. <words>42</words>
The first woman wore armor patched with orchard leaves; she spoke of horizons of mercy, how even a felled tree gives shade to the sapling beside it, and the pilot, remembering rotor blades that once scattered seed pods instead of shrapnel, felt the first tug of possibility. <words>46</words>
The second man, a carpenter with sawdust in his beard, confessed he had sharpened the very axes, then asked if mercy could be taught to steel; the pilot offered him a sprig of mugwort, saying, “Burn this and inhale the question,” and the carpenter wept into his ale. <words>46</words>
By the seventh encounter, the pilot’s voice had become a low orbit, circling the same plea: “Tell me what you would save if the world narrowed to one dawn,” and answers bloomed like contrails—children, songs, the memory of rain on canvas wings. <words>44</words>
When the bell of a salvaged sextant chimed midnight, the soothsherd collected the herb remnants, rolling them into a single smudge stick, and the pilot followed her out to the orchard’s edge where the first axe rested like a sleeping meteor. <words>42</words>
Together they lit the bundle; the smoke rose in the shape of a drone ascending, and the pilot, eyes stinging, whispered coordinates of mercy into the embered wind, luring possibility from the brink of despair with every curling wisp. <words>42</words>
At dawn, the axes remained sheathed, the orchard untouched, and the villagers stood in silent orbit around the charred circle where herbs had been, their faces turned toward a sky suddenly wider than any horizon they had feared to cross. <words>42</words>
The pilot walked back to the observatory, no longer lost, his palm smelling of lavender and burnt circuitry, cynically hopeful that somewhere a seed was already disobeying gravity. <words>34</words>
