In the velvet observatory at midsummer, where the dome drank starlight and exhaled mulberry ache, provenance researcher Lira Voss knelt beside a transparent violin made of ice crystal, its strings trembling like frost remembering wind. [38]  
She had traced the instrument’s lineage through seventeen shattered archives, each ledger whispering of a perforated destiny: a prophecy once whole, now riddled with holes through which futures leaked like melted snow. [55]  
Tonight, before the promise loses its glow, she needed to know whether the dream threaded inside the violin outweighed the empire that coveted it. [65]  
The empire’s envoys would arrive at dawn to claim the artifact, believing its music could freeze revolutions in mid-chord; Lira intended to weigh that claim against the quieter revolution humming in her own ribs. [78]  
She set an enamel cup on the parquet floor, poured coffee so dark it reflected constellations, and waited for the surface to still. [87]  
Reading the future in coffee stains was a method her grandmother dismissed as kitchen charlatanry, yet the old woman had also taught Lira to listen when leaves spoke, a talent that had lately become accidentally telepathic with plants. [104]  
The ivy curling along the observatory’s ribs rustled now, sending her an image of roots clutching a heart-shaped stone; the stone cracked, and sap the color of mulberries bled out. [116]  
Lira sipped, leaving a crescent of oil on the rim, then inverted the cup; the grounds slid, forming a spiral that broke into three islands. [125]  
The first island resembled the empire’s sigil, a crowned serpent; the second, a violin bow bent into a question mark; the third, a seed. [134]  
She touched the seed shape and felt the ivy shiver again, urging her to propagate something unnamed. [141]  
The transparent violin answered with a faint harmonic, its ice crystal body amplifying the plant’s pulse until the observatory itself seemed to breathe chlorophyll. [150]  
Lira closed her eyes and let the accidental telepathy widen; every potted fern, every blade of grass pushing through floorboard cracks, chorused the same refrain: the empire will plant you like a flag, but the dream will plant itself like a forest. [165]  
She saw then the perforated destiny not as loss but as permeability: holes through which new roots could travel. [173]  
The violin had been carved from a glacier that once covered the empire’s capital; when the ice melted, it carried away the names of the conquered, and those names now resonated inside the instrument, seeking return. [185]  
Lira understood her role was not to preserve the artifact but to complete its thaw. [192]  
She lifted the violin; its surface fogged beneath her fingerprints, and the ivy extended a tendril to wrap the scroll, as if offering a bow. [200]  
Together, woman, plant, and instrument made a new chord, one that tasted of mulberries too ripe, of endings sweet enough to bruise. [209]  
The coffee islands bled into one another, the crowned serpent dissolving into the seed, the question mark becoming a stem. [217]  
Lira set the violin on the windowsill where midsummer starlight could pour through it; light refracted, projecting a lattice of melting runes onto the velvet walls. [226]  
Each rune was a future the empire had pruned away, now budding again. [232]  
She pressed her ear to the ivy’s leaves and heard the empire’s drums approaching, but she also heard the slower drum of photosynthesis, patient and irreversible. [242]  
The promise—her promise—was to let the dream propagate until it outweighed every gilded scale of conquest. [250]  
She took the violin’s bow, itself carved from a single frozen vein of sap, and drew it across strings that sang like thawing rivers. [259]  
The note traveled outward, slipping through the perforated destiny, seeding every listening root with rebellion dressed as lullaby. [267]  
By the time the empire’s envoys reached the observatory doors, the velvet dome had become a hothouse of impossible midsummer snow, each flake a memory the violin refused to surrender. [277]  
Lira stood among the ferns, bow still in hand, weighing the dream against the empire on scales made of starlight and chlorophyll. [286]  
The empire offered gold, titles, a conservatory where the violin would be caged in climate-controlled silence. [293]  
The dream offered only continuation: forests humming the glacier’s true name, revolutions that began as seedlings and ended as canopies. [301]  
She chose the dream, slicing the bow across the strings one final time; the
