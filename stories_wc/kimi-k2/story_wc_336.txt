Upon the hush of budding hope, when dawn mist still clung to the fern-lined stones, the wise orchard pruner Arin stood on the verdant parapet beside the waterfall, listening to the water sing its silver syllables into the gorge below. [38]  
In his weathered palm rested a single heirloom seed, passed down through seven generations of dream-tenders, its shell veined with faint opal light that pulsed like a sleeping heartbeat. [55]  
Arin had spent a lifetime pruning not only branches but possibilities, yet the worlds he tended—one of leaf and loam, another of drifting auroras—were beginning to fray at their shared seams, their colors leaching into gray. [75]  
He was insatiably creative, always hearing extra notes in the thrush’s song, always seeing second moons behind the first; this surplus of vision had once been joy, but now it felt like a leak through which wonder itself might drain away. [95]  
To preserve the color of wonder, he had resolved to weave the two realms together more tightly, braiding their luminous strands before both faded. [110]  
He knelt on the parapet’s moss-soft edge, spread a circle of copper threads, and set the heirloom seed at its center like a compass rose of living memory. [125]  
The waterfall’s spray caught the threads, and each droplet became a tiny prism, casting fragments of other skies—rose, indigo, absinthe—across Arin’s lined face. [140]  
He began to hum the old grafting tune, low and circular, a sound that belonged half to lullaby and half to loom. [152]  
With each note he plucked a glimmer from the air: the scent of first snow, the hush before a comet’s tail, the coppery taste of a child’s unanswered question. [168]  
These essences he spun around the seed, weaving between worlds as deftly as he once wove apricot whip into plum stock, letting the graft take in the cambium of dreams. [185]  
The seed cracked silently, releasing a filament of green fire that climbed the water’s mist like ivy seeking invisible suns. [198]  
Arin felt the parapet tilt beneath him, not in space but in resonance; the orchard of waking and the orchard of reverie overlapped, branches sliding through one another like reflections deciding to shake hands. [215]  
In that radiant hush, he saw the gray recoil, color rushing back into petals and nebulae alike, brighter than before, as though gratitude itself were pigment. [230]  
Yet the weaving demanded toll: every strand he spun drew a corresponding thread from his own marrow, and his hands began to silver like moonlit bark. [245]  
He did not falter; to succor both worlds, he would give the sap of his own years, capturing essence not by theft but by reciprocal gift. [258]  
The seedling unfurled two leaves—one of living jade, one of translucent starlight—then arched toward the waterfall, drinking its roar and turning it into quiet auroras that pooled around Arin’s feet. [275]  
From those pools rose small creatures of fused pollen and constellation, wings of dawn and dusk beating in slow, shared rhythm. [288]  
They circled him, tasting the salt of his sacrifice, then scattered like luminous spores across both orchards, planting micro-wonders wherever they landed: a peach that hummed lullabies, a comet that smelled of rain on clay. [308]  
Arin’s breath grew thin, yet his eyes remained wide, reflecting the renewed riot of color. [318]  
He pressed his pruning knife into the soil beside the sapling, blade down, handle up, a promise that future grafts would be made by gentler hands. [332]  
The waterfall paused mid-cascade, a single suspended chord, then resumed with softer laughter, as if the gorge itself had learned new modesty. [345]  
Arin lay back against the parapet’s velvet moss, feeling the worlds’ weave tighten into a tapestry whose warp was time and whose weft was dreaming. [360]  
Above him, the two leaves of the sapling touched, forming a lens through which he glimpsed generations yet unborn, children who would taste starlight in cider and hear nebulae in lullabies. [378]  
He smiled, the radiant hush now inside his ribs, and closed his eyes, content that wonder’s color would outlast the vessel that carried it. [395]  
The sapling’s roots found the silvering in his bones and drank gently, transforming exhaustion into slow, sustaining amber. [408]  
When the next dawn came, the wise orchard pruner was gone, but the tree remained, trunk spiraled like a braid
