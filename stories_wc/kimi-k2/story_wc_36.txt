The driven relic keeper stood alone on the lip of the Thunder-echo range, the canyon hush so complete it felt avalanchingly quiet, as though the cliffs themselves were holding their breath. [34]  
After the guardianship had ended in fire and recrimination, she had walked west for three weeks, carrying only the gilded reed flute that had once been the covenant between worlds. [52]  
Its gold leaf was chipped now, the lip plate scarred by the teeth of the last gate she had failed to close. [68]  
She knelt on the basalt shelf and began arranging driftwood as directional markers, each bleached branch angled toward a different memory of collapse. [88]  
The first piece pointed north, to the night the sky tore open and the other world bled silver wind across the plateau. [108]  
The second leaned east, to the moment she chose to uncase the flute instead of sealing the breach, believing music could soothe what steel could not. [131]  
She remembered how the note she played had folded space like silk, how the guardianship sigil on her wrist had burned black, how the invaders had stepped through smiling. [158]  
Now the guardianship was dissolved, the council scattered, and the duty she had worn like armor had become a scar. [178]  
Yet she had come here, to the Thunder-echo range, because the canyon hush promised clarity, and because failure, if studied closely, might yield insights sharper than any victory. [208]  
She set the third marker west, toward the sea she had never seen, where driftwood began its journey and where, perhaps, the worlds might be rewoven. [232]  
The fourth she planted straight down, a spindle of cedar thrust into a crack that moaned softly when the wind shifted. [253]  
That moan was the only sound, avalanchingly quiet, as if the range itself were a bell struck once and still deciding whether to ring. [277]  
She lifted the gilded reed flute to her lips but did not play; instead she studied the hairline fracture running along the bore, the place where the note of opening had become the note of breaking. [306]  
In that fracture she saw the map of her mistake: she had tried to weave the worlds together when they needed to be braided apart, a loose plait that could stretch without snapping. [337]  
She laid the flute across the markers, aligning the fracture with the cedar spindle, and walked the circle again, this time counting heartbeats instead of paces. [365]  
At thirty-seven beats she heard the echo return, not thunder but memory, the canyon hush giving back the sound of her own voice saying, “I will keep the gate.” [395]  
The guardianship had not ended because the enemy was stronger; it had ended because she had believed keeping meant holding tight, when keeping sometimes meant letting go. [425]  
She knelt again and began rearranging the driftwood, turning each marker forty-five degrees, creating a spiral instead of a compass. [451]  
The spiral tightened toward the flute, and as she worked the air grew denser, the quiet pressing against her eardrums like deep water. [476]  
When the last stick clicked into place, the fracture in the flute widened with a sigh, and a single gold leaf fluttered out, spinning like a maple seed. [503]  
She caught it on her palm; it was warm, and etched on its inner face was a sigil she had never seen, a looped line that resembled both a closed gate and an open eye. [533]  
Understanding arrived avalanchingly quiet: the insight she sought was not how to mend the worlds but how to live in the tear between them, tending the wound instead of denying it. [567]  
She pressed the gold leaf into the fracture, sealing it not with force but with acknowledgment, and the flute resonated once, a note so low it was more vibration than sound. [599]  
The driftwood markers shifted by themselves, the spiral loosening into a gentle wave that pointed not toward escape but toward balance. [622]  
She stood, slipped the flute inside her coat, and began the descent into the canyon, where the guardianship would begin again, not as a wall but as a song shared across the breach. [654]  
Behind her, the Thunder-echo range exhaled, and for the first time since the fire, the quiet felt like shelter instead of accusation. [684]  
She walked on, arranging driftwood in her mind as she went, each piece a question, each angle an invitation to the worlds to braid themselves gently through her open hands. [720]  
At the canyon floor she paused, lifted the flute, and played a single note that did not open or close but simply acknowledged the space between, and the echo that
