Every year, between flights, Elara the somnambulist scout rose from her airline seat and walked barefoot through the forest toward the sunken laboratory that had once been her family's ancestral home. <words>31</words>
She carried nothing but a bottled lightning bug collection, each jar glowing with questions she had gathered while others slept. <words>21</words>
The woodland secrets pressed against her skin like dew; she was unapologetically humble before them, a cartographer of invisible paths. <words>20</words>
In the hush before dawn, she would scout the perimeter of the half-submerged building, her bare feet remembering moss-covered staircases that led nowhere and everywhere. <words>25</words>
Glass walls, now aquariums of memory, reflected her drifting form as she moved through corridors where her great-grandmother had once mapped neural starlight. <words>23</words>
Each lightning bug was a thought caught mid-flight, a fragment of spiritual wisdom she had harvested from passengers' dreams while they dozed above the clouds. <words>25</words>
She unscrewed the first jar; the insect spiraled upward, illuminating a rusted plaque: “Curiosity is the only compass that does not point north.” <words>23</words>
The words hummed, and Elara felt the woodland secrets rearrange themselves into a living map across her palms. <words>18</words>
Following the glow, she descended through a ruptured floor into the flooded archive where equations had once bloomed like orchids. <words>21</words>
Water lapped at shelves of notebooks; she opened one, and the ink swam into the shape of a heron, then a question mark, then her own sleeping face. <words>24</words>
She understood: to map spiritual wisdom was not to chart land but to notice how land dreams inside a person. <words>21</words>
Another jar released its star; it hovered above a cracked monitor displaying neural pathways that mirrored the forest's root systems. <words>21</words>
Loaded curiosity tugged her deeper, past bioluminescent fungi spelling out lullabies in Latin, past centrifuges now coral reefs of forgotten hypotheses. <words>22</words>
At the heart of the sunken laboratory, she found the original dream-catcher: a web of optic fibers still catching fragments of ancestral wonder. <words>22</words>
She placed her last lightning bug inside; the entire room pulsed, and the woodland secrets rose like tide, whispering coordinates only a somnambulist could follow. <words>25</words>
Elara closed her eyes, letting the map etch itself onto the inside of her eyelids, a constellation of humility and awe. <words>20</words>
When the sun finally climbed above the trees, she stepped back onto the forest path, her yearly pilgrimage complete, her pockets empty of jars but full of glowing directions. <words>27</words>
At the airport gate, she would board the next flight, fasten her seatbelt, and wait for the cabin lights to dim so she could begin scouting again, a quiet servant to the dreams of strangers and the woodland secrets that never stopped moving. <words>42</words>
