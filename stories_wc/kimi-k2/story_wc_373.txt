The tide had already turned when Lila Bell stepped onto the splintered planks of Pier 47, her boots soft against the salt-softened wood. [28]  
Below, the pirate market murmured like a half-remembered lullaby, lanterns swinging from rusted hooks, their glow the color of bruised peaches. [47]  
She carried her father’s antique watch fob in her fist, the gold warm from her pocket, its tiny compass needle still quivering from the last time he had wound it before the revenuers took him east. [78]  
Tonight the fob was not for telling time; it was the seal on a truce of hush between the runners and the smugglers, a promise that no gun would fire until sunrise. [104]  
Lila’s job was to stand in the middle of that hush and listen for the moment it cracked. [120]  
Her father had taught her that trust breaks with a sound lighter than breath, a sigh like wet rope giving way, and if she could capture that sound on the wire recorder hidden in her coat lining, the federal men would commute his sentence. [167]  
She descended the barnacle-crusted ladder, each rung a heartbeat closer to the comforting unease that lived under the pier. [192]  
The market smelled of kerosene, cinnamon, and gun oil; barrels of molasses moonshine stood in crooked rows, their wax seals stamped with laughing skulls. [220]  
A fiddler played a tune that kept starting over, false starts fluttering like moths against the dark, and Lila realized the song itself was a warning: no deal here ever began on the first try. [256]  
At the center of the crowd stood Captain Roe, the smuggler whose beard was braided with silver fishhooks, his eyes curiously steadfast on the girl who had come alone. [287]  
He lifted a flask, offered it to her without speaking; the truce said no words until the exchange was done. [312]  
Lila shook her head, pressed the watch fob to her lips instead, tasting the metal tang of her father’s worry. [334]  
Roe smiled, understanding, and placed a small cedar box on an upended crate; inside lay a single reel of magnetic tape, blank and waiting. [364]  
The bargain: she would give him the fob, he would give her silence, and together they would wait for trust to fracture on its own. [392]  
But Lila’s true purpose was to thwart the bargain, to let the hush break early and record the crack before Roe realized the feds were listening through her. [428]  
She thumbed the hidden switch on the recorder, felt the spool begin its hungry spin. [449]  
Around them, the market continued its restless choreography: a woman traded opals for morphine, a boy weighed out gunpowder on a candy scale, all of it muffled by the truce. [490]  
Time passed in false starts: a cough cut short, a bottle dropped and caught just before it shattered, the fiddler forever beginning the same phrase. [520]  
Each near-noise was a rehearsal for betrayal, and Lila’s pulse kept time with the antique fob ticking against her ribs. [545]  
Then Roe did something unexpected; he opened the cedar box wider, revealing not only the blank tape but also a photograph of her father, taken yesterday, smiling in his cell. [585]  
The captain’s eyes said, I know why you’re here, but I choose to believe you won’t pull the thread that unravels us both. [618]  
The comforting unease deepened, a quilt pulled over nightmares. [633]  
Lila’s thumb hovered over the recorder’s stop switch; the sound of trust breaking might also be the sound of her father’s heart. [662]  
She thought of all the nights she had helped him run jars through creek fog, how he taught her to listen for the hush between lightning and thunder, the same hush now trembling under the pier. [708]  
With thirty minutes until sunrise, she lifted the watch fob, let the chain spill like liquid gold across her palm, and set it gently inside the cedar box without taking the tape. [748]  
Roe exhaled, a sound almost too soft for the recorder, almost—but not quite—the sigh she had been sent to capture. [774]  
Instead of pressing stop, Lila rewound the spool, erased the last hour, and snapped the reel in two beneath her heel. [798]  
The fiddler finally finished his tune; the market exhaled; the truce held. [813]  
She walked back up the ladder as the sky bruised into dawn, the broken watch fob left behind like a promise that some sil
