The deflated oracle drifted through the abandoned carnival ring toss game, her translucent form sagging like forgotten silk. <words>19</words>
Empty perfume bottles clinked beneath her ethereal feet, their once-sweet promises now ghosts of lavender and regret. <words>31</words>
She was independently dependent on the dreamlike invitations that fluttered from her fingertips—fragments of memory shaped like carnival tickets, each one a doorway to what might have been. <words>50</words>
Tonight, beneath the subconscious moon that hung crooked in a sky of velvet ash, she would enact her final ceremony. <words>65</words>
The centuries-old ceremonial rope lay coiled between rusted milk bottles, its braids holding the laughter of every child who'd ever missed their mark. <words>82</words>
With fingers that existed only in the space between sleeping and waking, she began reconfiguring the braids of the rope, each twist releasing a different decade's worth of carnival music. <words>103</words>
The rope remembered—how the strongman had proposed to the bearded lady here, how the fortune teller had foreseen her own death in these very bottles, how the ring toss had once been the heart of summer itself. <words>130</words>
As she worked, the oracle's deflated form began to fill—not with air, but with the melancholic glee of every story she'd swallowed to survive. <words>150</words>
Each braid she unmade rewrote history: the boy who'd won the giant panda now chose the small purple elephant instead, changing the trajectory of his daughter's favorite bedtime story. <words>178</words>
The woman who'd walked away from the cheating game operator now stayed, her life splitting into a thousand different versions where she learned to forgive, to fight, to forget. <words>208</words>
The oracle herself had once been the carnival's star attraction, reading futures in the rings that never quite fit the bottles. <words>229</words>
But she'd seen too much—the way joy curdled into obligation, how love became a game of chance, why the prizes were always smaller than promised. <words>254</words>
So she'd deflated herself, becoming the keeper of might-have-beens, independently dependent on others' dreams to give her form. <words>278</words>
Now, with the rope's final braid undone, the carnival began to shift. <words>293</words>
The ring toss bottles multiplied into a forest of glass, each containing a different version of the same summer afternoon. <words>314</words>
The oracle stepped between them, her form solidifying into the young fortune teller she'd once been, before the weight of knowing had collapsed her. <words>343</words>
She picked up an empty perfume bottle—the last one, the one that had held her mother's scent—and breathed in the memory of gardenias and possibility. <words>372</words>
History rewritten, she became the first customer at her own booth, tossing a ring that landed perfectly around a bottle of pure, unbroken joy. <words>400</words>
The carnival lights flickered once, twice, then settled into a warm glow that existed only in dreams, where every missed throw could be tried again. <words>430</words>
And the oracle, no longer deflated, danced through the midway with melancholic glee, finally free to be independently dependent on her own dreams. <words>457</words>
