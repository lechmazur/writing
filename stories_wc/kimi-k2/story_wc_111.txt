The withered vine dresser, whose name was Lira, stepped into the garden maze at dawn, when the dew still clung to the iron archways like hesitant stars. [29]
After luck became measurable, every leaf and pebble in the royal grounds had been tagged with probability glyphs, but Lira ignored the glowing numerals; she carried instead a cracked collection of marbles in her apron pocket, each sphere a memory of a vine she had once coaxed back from blight. [64]
She had been summoned to prove that gardens know their gardeners, a phrase the young queen muttered like a curse after the court astrologers declared the maze “statistically indifferent to human intention.” [89]
Lira’s hands, mapped with scars and chlorophyll stains, closed around the marbles as she walked the gravel paths, their cracked surfaces catching the first light like tiny flawed moons. [109]
The air smelled of blooming withering: roses opening and roses dying in the same breath, the perfume so sweet it felt like a lie. [125]
She paused at the first junction, where a toppled sundial lay half swallowed by bindweed, and chose the left fork because the marble she drew was the color of the first grape she ever stole from her father’s arbor. [150]
Every few steps she polished a marble against her sleeve, not to restore its shine but to commemorate small victories elaborately: the marble that remembered saving the Duchess’s jasmine, the marble that recalled the night she grafted moonflower onto a poisoned stump. [175]
The maze responded to her presence; vines shifted, not quickly, but with the patience of something that has waited centuries for the right touch. [195]
She found the queen at the heart, seated on a stone bench beneath a dying wisteria whose blossoms hung like pale regrets. [210]
“You’re late,” the queen said, tapping a brass device that clicked out luck percentages like a nervous cricket. [225]
“I walk at the speed of remembering,” Lira replied, and set the cracked marbles in a circle around the bench, each crack aligned so the fractures formed a single jagged vine. [245]
The queen scoffed, but her eyes followed the pattern. [252]
Lira began to speak, not to the girl but to the garden, telling it stories of every marble: how the green one had been traded for a cutting of heartleaf that now climbed the eastern wall, how the amber one had rolled beneath the throne room door the night the old king died and the vines outside bloomed out of season. [285]
With each tale she polished the marble again, the motion steady, wisely pragmatic, as if shine were a language the leaves could read. [305]
The wisteria stirred; a single blossom detached and landed on the queen’s lap, its edges already browning. [318]
“Coincidence,” the queen whispered, but her device fell silent. [327]
Lira lifted the last marble, the one split clean through yet still whole, and pressed it into the soil at the base of the wisteria. [345]
“This one remembers the lie I told the North Wind to keep frost from your cradle vines,” she said. [360]
The ground trembled softly; roots shifted, and new shoots, pale and tender, spiraled up the trellis. [375]
The queen stared at the device: the probability of spontaneous bloom had spiked to ninety-nine percent, then the screen cracked, a hairline fracture mirroring the marble’s. [395]
“Gardens keep their own accounts,” Lira said. [403]
The queen touched the fresh vine, her fingers coming away wet with sap and something like tears. [415]
Lira gathered the marbles, but left the split one buried; some deceptions, once mended, must stay in the earth to hold the truth up. [435]
Together they walked out of the maze, the paths shortening before them as if the hedges had decided the journey was finished. [455]
Behind them, the wisteria burst into full flower, petals falling like purple snow, covering the bench, the device, the single marble now grown over with root and bloom. [480]
At the gate, the queen stopped. [486]
“Will it last?” she asked. [491]
“Nothing lasts,” Lira said, “but everything remembers.” [500]
She placed a polished marble in the queen’s palm, the one that recalled the first seed she ever planted after her mother died. [520]
The girl closed her fist around it, feeling the crack like a secret pulse. [530]
Years later, when the queen’s own daughter wandered the maze, she found the vine that grew from the split marble, its trunk twisted into the shape of a woman cradling a child, and beneath it a fresh collection of marbles, cracked and gleaming, waiting for the next gardener who would
