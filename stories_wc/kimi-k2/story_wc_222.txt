The sky was wrong the morning Kael scaled the icebound spire above the clouds, its colors bruised violet and copper like a wound that refused to heal. [34]  
He was a chivalrous thief, the kind who bowed before lifting purses, and today he climbed to steal back wonder itself. [50]  
At the summit, the apprentice of wonder waited inside a chamber of frozen mirrors, her breath fogging the air with tiny galaxies. [70]  
She called herself Lira, and her eyes held the sacredly playful glint of someone who had never been told no. [88]  
Between them stood a chessboard carved from whale-bone and obsidian, its pieces already mid-game. [105]  
Kael opened his coat and drew out the pocket sundial lid, its brass warm against his palm despite the altitude. [125]  
The lid was rumored to open only when the sky was wrong, and the sky had been wrong for three days. [144]  
Lira smiled, not kindly, and gestured to the board. [154]  
"One move each," she said. [160]  
"Swap a piece, and the secret inside becomes yours to amend." [172]  
Kael studied the knight he intended to move; its base unscrewed with a faint click, revealing a curl of parchment. [192]  
On the parchment was written his own birth-name, a truth he had buried beneath aliases and honor. [211]  
He hesitated, then lifted the knight and offered it to Lira. [222]  
She accepted, handing him a pawn whose hollow belly held a single snowdrop petal, preserved by cold and magic. [243]  
The exchange felt like breathing underwater—terrifying, luminous. [256]  
As the pieces touched the board again, the spire shuddered, ice groaning like a cathedral organ. [273]  
Cracks spidered outward, and through them Kael glimpsed the sky rearranging itself, violet bleeding into copper, copper into gold. [295]  
Lira's expression softened from challenge to invitation. [304]  
"Every wonder demands a price," she whispered. [313]  
"But the price is only what you refuse to release." [323]  
Kael understood: to amend the wrongness above, he must first amend the fear inside. [339]  
He unscrewed the pocket sundial lid; instead of gears, it held a miniature dawn, swirling like liquid sunrise. [360]  
Without ceremony he tipped the dawn onto the chessboard. [370]  
Light pooled, melting the pieces into silhouettes of birds that lifted and circled the chamber. [387]  
The ice walls began to weep, not from warmth but from recognition. [400]  
Lira laughed, the sound bright as breaking bells. [410]  
"Now you are apprentice as well," she declared. [420]  
Together they stepped onto the windowsill, wind tugging their coats like impatient children. [437]  
Below, the world was a map of forgotten stories; above, the sky waited to be rewritten. [454]  
Kael felt the cautious abandon of a man who has already lost everything and found it again in the same breath. [478]  
He spread his arms, embracing the unknown with open arms, the way a cliff embraces the sea. [497]  
Lira took his hand, her fingers cold yet steady. [507]  
They leapt. [509]  
For a moment they fell through the wrong sky, colors tasting of thunder and honey. [526]  
Then the dawn inside the spire burst outward, catching them in wings of light. [542]  
They did not descend; instead, the clouds rose to meet them, soft as forgiveness. [558]  
Where they landed, the ice was gone, replaced by grass that chimed when stepped upon. [575]  
The chessboard lay beside them, empty now, its squares slowly fading into soil. [592]  
Kael looked at Lira, then at the horizon where the sky stitched itself into a new rightness. [612]  
"Will it last?" he asked. [619]  
"Nothing lasts," she replied, "but everything amends." [631]  
She plucked the snowdrop petal from his palm and pressed it into the ground. [647]  
A tiny white flower opened, luminous against the dark earth. [661]  
Kael bowed, chivalrous even in wonder, and Lira curtsied like a child who had learned grace from storms. [682]  
Together they walked toward the edge of the world, where the next wrong sky waited to be loved into shape. [704]  
Behind them, the spire dissolved into mist, carrying the echo of their laughter down to the waking lands below. [726]
