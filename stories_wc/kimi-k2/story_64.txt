The uncertain alchemist, technically wild beneath her guild robes, knelt on the centuries-old marble floor of the floating marketplace tethered to hot air balloons, tracing coded scuffs with a fingertip that still smelled of sulfur and regret. <words>34</words>
At the hush before the judge reads the verdict, she pressed the cracked scale from a mythical beast against her palm, feeling its faint pulse like a second heartbeat, and wondered if immortality was worth the price of every forest trail she would never map. <words>46</words>
She had come to safeguard the scale, not to sell it, yet the vendors drifting past on their balloon-stalls offered her maps of places that did not exist, maps drawn in ink that aged backwards, maps that whispered coordinates only the dead could follow. <words>42</words>
Each scuff on the marble was a cipher left by her predecessor, an alchemist who had chosen eternal life and forgotten how to dream of paths through pine and fog. <words>30</words>
She deciphered the first line: “To live forever, abandon the compass.” <words>11</words>
The second: “To remember the way, forget the destination.” <words>10</words>
The third was a spiral, a snail shell, a promise that every step inward was also outward, and she felt the scale warm, drinking her doubt like nectar. <words>31</words>
A bell rang once, the judge clearing his throat on the courthouse balloon tethered three ropes away, and the marketplace stilled, baskets of levitating lemons bobbing in the hush. <words>31</words>
She saw then that the scale was not a gift but a ledger, its cracks tallying every mile she would never walk, every dawn she would never greet with blistered feet and a pocket full of acorns. <words>39</words>
The alchemist rose, technically wild no longer, her guild robes slipping from her shoulders like shed skin, and she placed the scale onto the marble where the spiral ended. <words>32</words>
The floor accepted it; the scuffs rearranged themselves into a map of the forest she had played in as a child, trails marked by tiny miracles: a feather that never decayed, a brook that sang lullabies, a clearing where time moved sideways. <words>44</words>
She stepped onto the map barefoot, feeling the cool stone become moss, the hush become birdsong, the verdict become irrelevant. <words>25</words>
Behind her, the judge spoke the word “guilty,” but it sounded like wind in distant leaves. <words>16</words>
The marketplace drifted on, balloons bobbing like lanterns, while she walked the first trail, heart hammering with the mundane miracle of mortality, compassless and finally, gloriously lost. <words>32</words>
The cracked scale remained, a small, dark star on the marble, recording the price she had refused to pay. <words>21</words>
Somewhere below, forests waited, unmapped and breathing. <words>9</words>
