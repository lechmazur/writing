The skeptical minstrel, Lyric, strummed a discordant chord outside the rusted gates of the disappearing ink factory, certain the immortal trickster, Puck, was hiding inside with another prank. <words>31</words>
She clutched the dragon-scale armor scrap she'd won in a rigged tavern bet, its surface shimmering with colors that shouldn't exist, impossibly plausible proof that dragons once inked their own legends. <words>37</words>
Puck had promised her the secret to eternal song, but only if she could out-scheme him by midday, when the empty mailbox at the factory's edge would swallow its last letter forever. <words>34</words>
Lyric's reckless generosity had already cost her three lutes and a broken heart; she'd given away every coin to street urchins who swore they'd seen Puck turn tears into gold. <words>32</words>
Inside, the factory's machinery wheezed like dying beasts, steam vents hissing secrets in forgotten tongues, while vats of vanishing ink bubbled with the ghosts of unsent love letters. <words>31</words>
She found Puck lounging atop a conveyor belt, wearing nothing but a smirk and a crown made of fountain pens, his eyes twinkling with the kind of mischief that had toppled empires. <words>33</words>
"To out-scheme me," he purred, "you must launch your heart through the steam vent's eye using only this," producing a child's slingshot carved from a unicorn's wishbone. <words>31</words>
Lyric laughed, the sound sharp as broken glass, and tied the dragon-scale scrap to the slingshot's band, recklessly generous with her only proof of magic. <words>29</words>
The scrap caught the vent's hiss like a sail, spiraling upward in colors that painted temporary murals on the factory's soot-stained walls, each image a memory she'd traded away. <words>32</words>
Puck's grin faltered as the scrap transformed mid-flight, scales unfolding into a miniature dragon that breathed disappearing ink across his immortal face, branding him with vanishing freckles. <words>33</words>
"Your scheme," Lyric sang, voice dripping with irreverent awe, "was believing I'd play fair when I've already wonâ€”every note I gave away returns as songs you'll never forget, even when you try." <words>36</words>
The dragon dissolved into music notes that embedded themselves in the factory's bones, causing the machinery to play a symphony of regret as the mailbox at midday gave its final, hollow clang. <words>34</words>
Puck vanished with a petulant pop, leaving behind only his crown, which Lyric placed on her own head, already composing the ballad of how generosity, not trickery, had outwitted eternity itself. <words>34</words>
As she walked away, the factory began to fade, taking its secrets with it, but the dragon-scale scrap reappeared in her pocket, warm and humming with the last verse of a song that would never disappear. <words>36</words>
