In the obsidian skyscraper that served as St. Elara's Hospital, Nurse Marigold—pleasant meddler by reputation—tiptoed through the dim ward during the quiet shift before sunrise, clutching a pair of rusted ice skates like a talisman.<words>37</words>
She believed the blades, etched with ancient symbols, could decode the fevered whispers of the comatose linguist in Room 47, whose dreams had begun to scatter seeds of forgotten alphabets across the monitors.<words>32</words>
Marigold was openly manipulative, yet her smile disarmed interns and orderlies alike; she convinced the night guard to unlock the supply closet where she had hidden the skates since the last winter storm.<words>31</words>
The linguist’s chart spoke of lucid confusion: he thrashed at 3:07 a.m., tracing glyphs in the air that matched the corrosion on the skate blades, as though the metal remembered what flesh had lost.<words>30</words>
She knelt beside his bed, aligning the rusted ice skates under the faint green glow of the ventilator, and whispered, “Tell me what weakens the seal between waking and memory.”<words>27</words>
His eyelids fluttered; the monitors spiked, and in that pulse Marigold saw the receding footprints of a nighttime beach wanderer she herself had been years ago, before ambition lured her into these steel heights.<words>32</words>
Back then, barefoot on cold sand, she had followed those prints until they vanished into tide-foamed darkness, leaving her with a compulsion to chase every unfinished story.<words>26</words>
Now, inside the obsidian skyscraper, she mirrored that walk along the corridor’s polished floor, letting the skates’ blades scrape softly, erasing her own tracks as she went, weakening the boundary between past and present.<words>31</words>
Each scritch echoed like scattered seeds striking glass, and the linguist’s fingers twitched, sketching symbols that rearranged themselves into the very footprints she had lost.<words>25</words>
Marigold pressed the rusted ice skates to his palms; metal met skin, and the corrosion flaked away, revealing bright steel inscribed with a map of neural pathways.<words>25</words>
The ward lights flickered; dawn’s first pallor seeped through slatted blinds, and the pleasant meddler realized the ancient symbols were not letters but coordinates—latitude and longitude of the beach where her younger self had turned back.<words>34</words>
With lucid confusion she understood: to decode the symbols was to accept that every manipulation, every meddled life, had merely been a detour on the path to this moment of surrender.<words>29</words>
She left the skates on the windowsill, their blades now clean, and walked barefoot down the emergency stairwell, following the receding footprints only she could see, out of the obsidian skyscraper toward the horizon where sky met sea.<words>36</words>
Behind her, the linguist opened his eyes, whispering the first coherent word in weeks: “Marigold,” scattering seeds of recognition across the hushed ward like salt on old wounds.<words>28</words>
