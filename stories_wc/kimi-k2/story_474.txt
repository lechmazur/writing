The radio host who channels the dead signed up for soufflé lessons because nightmares had begun to follow her voice out of the speakers and into her bedroom. <words>31</words>
Amid quiet rebellion against the spectral tyranny, she hoped that learning to fold egg whites would teach her how to relinquish the voices instead of amplifying them. <words>25</words>
During the first class she collided—literally, flour everywhere—with a woman whose eyes held galaxies, a run-in while both taking a cooking class that would reroute both destinies. <words>26</words>
The stranger apologized in seven languages at once, then whispered, “You’re bleeding sound; let me show you a quieter kitchen,” and led her through a pantry door that should not have opened into starlight. <words>31</words>
They stepped into a celestial grotto guarded by living shadows that bowed, recognizing the host’s entourage of murmuring dead. <words>21</words>
At the grotto’s center rested a chessboard missing all the pawns, its remaining pieces carved from moonstone and obsidian, intricately simple in design yet humming with the gravity of unfinished games. <words>28</words>
The stranger—who called herself Echo—explained that every voice the host carried was a displaced piece, and only by arranging them in concert rather than conquest could the nightmare be outrun. <words>29</words>
Together they cooked under constellations, stirring batter that shimmered like nebulae while the dead lined up, shyly offering recipes from forgotten tongues. <words>23</words>
Each ingredient added a new accent to the air—cardamom, saffron, ghost-pepper—until the cavern smelled like the strength in diversity made edible. <words>23</words>
Echo set the chessboard between saucepans and moved a knight; the host countered with a rook, but Echo shook her head, tipped both pieces into the batter, and folded them in. <words>29</words>
“No sides,” she said, “only flavor,” and the shadows rippled in agreement, their darkness softening into indigo. <words>18</words>
The dead began to hum, not the usual static pleas but harmonies that braided Arabic quarter tones with Gaelic lullabies, Tuvan throat song with Caribbean steel. <words>25</words>
The nightmare arrived then, a writhing mass of every regret the host had ever broadcast, but the music wrapped around it like meringue, sweetening its edges until it dissolved into harmless foam. <words>30</words>
When the soufflé rose, it lifted the remaining chess pieces with it, suspending king beside bishop, queen beside rook, in a single airy architecture. <words>24</words>
Echo handed the host a spoon. <words>5</words>
“Eat,” she said, “and relinquish the need to separate voices; let them settle inside you like spices in a shared stew.” <words>22</words>
The host tasted galaxies, grief, garlic, grace—familiar puzzle pieces finally forming a picture of home. <words>17</words>
She stepped back through the pantry lighter; the radio show that night crackled with recipes instead of hauntings, and listeners across the quiet rebellion felt less alone. <words>28</words>
In the celestial grotto, the living shadows reset the chessboard, still missing pawns, now ready for a game where every piece moves together. <words>23</words>
