The meandering bard, lute slung like a question across his back, climbed the spiral shelves of the labyrinthine bookstore that occupied the entire mountain, each step echoing with the hush of unread pages. <words>34</words>
He carried in his pocket the dentures rumored to belong to the long-dead poet-queen, ivory still warm from the last hand that had believed in them. <words>27</words>
Ordinarily extraordinary, the teeth hummed with a low, steady heat, as though the queen’s final apology still clung to the enamel. <words>22</words>
Tonight, during the lull before an apologetic text was sent by someone he once loved, the bard meant to sow that warmth into hearts grown cold. <words>26</words>
He slipped through a hidden door behind the philosophy stacks and descended into a seedy bar lit by guttering candles and regret. <words>22</words>
On a makeshift stage of overturned crates, he set up his subversive puppet show: marionettes carved from wine corks, their mouths hinged with slivers of the radiant dentures. <words>26</words>
The first tale was of a shepherd who apologized to the wolf, and the ivory glowed, casting fractured idyll light across faces scarred by cynicism. <words>24</words>
A one-eyed smuggler wept into her ale; a retired assassin laughed like a boy again. <words>16</words>
Between acts, the bard tuned his lute to the faint vibration of the teeth, letting the warmth seep into chords that tasted of honey and ash. <words>25</words>
He told of the queen who, before her fall, wrote apologies on rice paper and folded them into paper boats for every soul she had wronged. <words>27</words>
The dentures grew hotter, pulsing like a second heart, until the bar itself seemed to breathe forgiveness. <words>19</words>
Yet the bard felt the lull thinning; somewhere above, in the mountain’s peak, a phone screen glowed with an unsent message beginning “I’m sorry—”. <words>26</words>
He quickened the final act: the marionettes embraced, their ivory mouths clicking out a rhythm of reconciliation that rattled bottles and bones. <words>23</words>
When the show ended, the patrons sat in stunned silence, warmth pooling in their chests like spilled sun. <words>19</words>
The bard packed the dentures away, their glow dimming but not dying, and climbed back through the bookstore’s arteries of dust and ink. <words>24</words>
At the summit, he found the phone abandoned on a windowsill, its screen cracked, the message still un-sent. <words>19</words>
He placed the dentures beside it; the warmth spread through the glass, through the signal, through the night. <words>18</words>
Somewhere far below, the smuggler texted her daughter; the assassin called his sister. <words>16</words>
The bard strummed once, softly, and the mountain answered with the rustle of a million turning pages, an apology finally released into the dark. <words>25</words>
