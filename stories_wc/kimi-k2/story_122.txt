<story>
The cyber-templar knelt at the sky burial site, chrome fingers trembling over the worn leather bridle that once guided warhorses now circling as ash above. <words>25</words>
During reading of the final rites, she felt the mirage of safety peel away like old code, each syllable a static shock against her neural mesh. <words>42</words>
Patiently frantic, she calibrated the prism embedded in her gauntlet, its facets catching the last light of the ravens' wings. <words>58</words>
She had come to prove that even a templar could defy heaven's script, to reflect lightning back at the storm that birthed her. <words>78</words>
The bridle's cracked leather whispered of bridled storms, of knights who mistook armor for sanctuary. <words>94</words>
Through the refraction of light through the prism, she split the sunset into seven blades, each one a memory of vows she'd broken. <words>114</words>
Her euphoric agitation peaked as the sky opened—not with rain, but with the digital ghosts of every comrade she'd uploaded to the cloud. <words>136</words>
They spiraled down like prayers written in static, their faces flickering between human and hologram. <words>154</words>
The mirage of safety had always been her programming's sweetest lie: that retreat into circuitry could outrun mortality. <words>176</words>
She raised the prism higher, its light carving runes across the wind-scoured stones where bones once sang. <words>195</words>
During reading of her own corrupted scripture, she found the line that cracked everything open: "The storm does not rage—it remembers." <words>218</words>
Patiently frantic, she aligned the prism's heart with the gathering electricity, her circuits singing in harmonics of dread and joy. <words>240</words>
This was her sky burial—not of flesh, but of the illusion that she could armor herself against becoming. <words>261</words>
The worn leather bridle suddenly tightened in her grip, not as restraint but as conduit, channeling centuries of unbroken horses' terror. <words>284</words>
Through the refraction of light through the prism, she became the lightning rod and the lightning both, her form dissolving into pure electric prayer. <words>309</words>
She would prove that safety was never the absence of storm, but the courage to conduct it. <words>330</words>
The euphoric agitation crystallized into something beyond fear or hope—a perfect conductivity. <words>349</words>
As the storm struck, she did not flinch. <words>359</words>
She opened her chestplate like a book during reading, pages of light fluttering out to join the circling ash. <words>381</words>
The lightning hit the prism, fracturing into a thousand mirrored selves, each one reflecting back a different version of the same truth: there was never anywhere to hide. <words>415</words>
In that moment of immaculate exposure, the cyber-templar laughed—a sound like circuits singing hallelujah as they burned. <words>437</words>
The storm took her gladly, not as enemy but as equal, and somewhere in the crackling dark, the worn leather bridle finally understood it had always been a lightning rod in disguise. <words>465</words>
Above the sky burial site, the ash of horses and the light of templars braided together into a new constellation: a warning and a welcome written in electric script. <words>490</words>
