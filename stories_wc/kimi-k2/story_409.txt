<story>
The bruised fighter wakes in a dusty attic where brass mice tick and tin owls hoot on the hour, their gears catching moonlight like tiny knives. <words>25</words>
He clutches a clay pot shard whose inscription reads “Stand or shatter,” the letters cut by a hand that must have been skillfully incompetent, half the verbs missing. <words>34</words>
At the moment a sculptor’s chisel first strikes marble somewhere below, the attic floor quivers, and the fighter feels the blow inside his cracked ribs. <words>46</words>
He is here to abduct the last comfortable lie he still tells himself—that he fights for honor—before the marble dust rises and the dream forgets him. <words>59</words>
The clockwork animals circle, their tails winding tighter, measuring the seconds until the dream dissolves. <words>69</words>
He kneels, places the shard against his heart, and whispers the missing verbs, trying to stand for something that will not break. <words>81</words>
A copper cricket hops onto his wrist and chirps the hour backwards; each note drags him deeper into forgotten dreams where every defeat replays in slow, merciless detail. <words>96</words>
In one dream he sees himself throwing a fight for coin, in another he lets a friend take the fall; the bruises bloom again, purple maps of cowardice. <words>110</words>
The shard heats until the inscription glows, and he understands the pot never held water—it held reflections, and he has been drinking illusions. <words>124</words>
The sculptor strikes again; marble cracks, and the attic tilts like a sinking ship. <words>134</words>
The fighter stands, though his knees betray him, skillfully incompetent at surrender. <words>144</words>
He lifts the shard like a dagger and drives it into the brass chest of a mechanical lion; gears spill, and from the wreckage rises the child he once was, fists already clenched. <words>160</words>
The child speaks with the fighter’s own voice: “You said you’d protect me.” <words>169</words>
The fighter nods, tears cutting clean tracks through the grime on his cheeks. <words>178</words>
He abducts the child—not by force, but by promise—carrying him toward the attic door that now opens onto daylight. <words>191</words>
Behind them, the clockwork animals slow, their springs unwinding, the forgotten dreams collapsing into silence. <words>203</words>
The sculptor’s chisel rings a final time; marble becomes statue, and the attic becomes memory. <words>214</words>
The fighter steps through the door, shard still clenched, the inscription now reading simply “Stand.” <words>225</words>
He will not polish the shard; he will carry the cut edges so every future blow reminds him what he stands for. <words>238</words>
The child walks beside him, barefoot on the real ground, no longer a vestige but a vow. <words>249</words>
Together they leave the attic of illusions, the fighter’s bruises already healing into the shape of truth. <words>261</words>
