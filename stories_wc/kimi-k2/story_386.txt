In the hush of a line that never moves, beneath the borrowed dawn of an atom-powered lighthouse, stood Kael, a time refugee from a forgotten empire, clutching an embroidered tablecloth that shimmered with the constellations of a sky no one remembered. <words>42</words>
The lighthouse thrummed with a low, atomic pulse, its beam sweeping across the horizon like a silent guardian, while Kael waited, quietly defiant, for the stars to align as they had in the empire’s final hour. <words>34</words>
The tablecloth, stitched by his mother’s hands in threads of silver and grief, bore the map of their lost world—each star a memory, each knot a promise to bind old wounds with unstoppable will. <words>32</words>
He was trustworthy strange, a man who spoke in riddles of time and carried the weight of centuries in his eyes, yet the lighthouse keeper, an old woman with a voice like rusted gears, let him stay because she saw the truth in his stillness. <words>38</words>
Every night, Kael climbed the spiral stairs to the lantern room, where the atomic core glowed like a captive sun, and laid the tablecloth on the floor, aligning its stars with the ones visible through the glass. <words>32</words>
The line outside the lighthouse never moved—travelers frozen mid-step, mouths open in silent screams, caught in the moment the empire fell—but Kael moved among them like a ghost, touching their faces with fingers that remembered warmth. <words>36</words>
He had escaped the catapult of time by sheer will, flung forward as his world burned, and now he waited for the alignment that would let him return—not to save the empire, but to stitch its wounds closed with the threads of this cloth. <words>38</words>
The keeper watched him, her eyes reflecting the borrowed dawn, and asked once, “Why do you stay?” Kael replied, “Because I am the last knot in the weave, and without me, the pattern unravels.” <words>35</words>
On the seventh night, the stars slid into place, the tablecloth glowing brighter than the atomic core, and Kael stepped onto it, feeling the catapult’s pull again—but this time, he was ready. <words>33</words>
The lighthouse dimmed as the stars drank its light, and the line outside shivered, the frozen travelers blinking awake as time unstitched itself. <words>25</words>
Kael vanished, the tablecloth dissolving into stardust, leaving only the keeper and the quiet hum of the lighthouse, its beam now sweeping across a horizon where the empire’s wounds began to close, one star at a time. <words>35</words>
In the borrowed dawn, the lighthouse stood alone, trustworthy strange, a monument to the man who had bound old wounds with unstoppable will, quietly defiant against the silence of a line that would never move again. <words>34</words>
