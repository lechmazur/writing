The loop pedal priest stood at the dimensional anchor, a place where space folded like origami and time pooled into itself. [21]  
His cassock shimmered with the same silver as the anchor’s lattice, as though he were stitched from the same fabric that held realities apart. [34]  
In his left hand he carried an artist’s palette with one color: a mute, pearlescent white that absorbed sound instead of reflecting light. [48]  
He had come here before the possession completes, when the stillness between heartbeats was still negotiable. [61]  
The demon that sought entry spoke only in assumptions, and the priest’s vow was to illuminate hidden assumptions before they hardened into dogma. [77]  

He knelt, pressing the palette to the ground so the color bled outward like spilled milk, forming a circle that decorates with silence. [93]  
Where the color touched, the ambient hum of the anchor dimmed; even the wind forgot its name. [105]  
From his belt he unclipped the loop pedal, a small black box whose single red eye blinked like a cautious confession. [119]  
He tapped it once, recording the hush, then again, layering the absence until the quiet became a chord dense enough to plumb. [134]  
Each layer was a rhetorical device: the first anaphora of nothing, the second chiasmus of echo, the third apostrophe to the void. [150]  
The demon, still formless, recoiled from the clarity of the argument; silence, when structured, is harder to possess than noise. [165]  

The priest spoke, but his words were muffled clarity, syllables wrapped in felt yet sharp as glass shards beneath. [178]  
“Assumption one,” he said, voice looping back on itself, “that stillness is empty.” [190]  
The loop pedal played his statement backward, revealing the hidden premise: emptiness fears being filled. [203]  
“Assumption two,” he continued, “that possession is inevitable.” [214]  
The pedal reversed it, showing the axiom: inevitability excuses surrender. [225]  
With each reversal, the pearlescent circle brightened, its single color refracting the demon’s outline like frost on a window. [240]  

The dimensional anchor trembled, its lattice threads vibrating in Morse code the priest alone could read: unraveled stillness approaching. [256]  
He understood the phrase not as a warning but as a method; to unravel stillness is to reveal the motion it conceals. [271]  
He pressed the pedal again, this time recording the tremor itself, turning the anchor’s fear into a question: what moves when nothing seems to? [287]  
The demon answered with a whispered axiom: “I am the motion you refuse.” [298]  
The priest smiled, the expression soft as snowfall, and released the final loop. [309]  
The layered silences collapsed into a single heartbeat, a pulse that was neither his nor the demon’s but the anchor’s own. [323]  

In that shared heartbeat, assumptions became visible threads, glowing like fiber optics. [335]  
The priest lifted the palette; the single color rose with it, stretching into a ribbon that tied the threads into a bow. [349]  
He offered the bow to the demon, a gift of articulated quiet. [359]  
The demon hesitated, its form flickering between smoke and mirror. [369]  
To accept would be to acknowledge the assumptions as constructs, not truths. [380]  
To refuse would be to remain outside, forever knocking at a door made of silence. [391]  

The priest waited, decorates with silence still expanding, until the demon reached out a tendril and touched the bow. [406]  
At contact, the color drained from the palette, leaving it blank as unwritten scripture. [418]  
The demon unraveled, its substance becoming letters that spelled the assumptions it had carried. [430]  
The letters dissolved into the anchor’s lattice, reinforcing the threads that hold worlds apart. [442]  
The loop pedal clicked once more, then fell silent, its red eye closing like a satisfied mouth. [455]  

The priest stood, palette empty, pedal still. [464]  
The dimensional anchor hummed a new note, neither warning nor welcome but acknowledgment. [476]  
He bowed to the space where the demon had been, a gesture of respect for the questions that almost wore a face. [491]  
Then he turned and walked back along the folded corridor, his cassock now plain gray, the shimmer transferred to the lattice behind him. [507]  
Somewhere, a congregation would soon wake to find their priest returned, carrying no sermons but a deeper quiet. [522]  
They would not know that he had saved them not by
