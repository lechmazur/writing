The tuneless bard, fiercely nonchalant, slouched at the brass rail of the steampunk airship dining room while a velvet-clad poet recited odes to copper and steam. <words>25</words>
Between clinks of crystal and hiss of valves, the bard fingered the stained manuscript he’d bartered for with a single cracked smile, its margins crawling with ink like trapped wasps. <words>37</words>
He had chased the rumor across three ports and two crashes, following twisted word-of-mouth legends that claimed these pages could tame chaos itself—if sung aloud. <words>50</words>
Yet the bard could not carry a tune; every note he loosed curdled the air worse than engine smoke, so he kept the verses folded like contraband beneath his coat. <words>63</words>
Tonight, amid poetry readings, the captain announced a contest: whoever calmed the storm now battering the hull would earn the right to kiss the horizon of madness, that shimmering seam where sky and delirium touched. <words>78</words>
The poets declaimed louder, their meter shaking chandeliers; the storm answered with thunder that rattled cutlery into flight. <words>88</words>
Brazen humility tugged the bard upright—he bowed to the room, apologizing in advance, then struck a flint over his tinderbox and set the stained manuscript ablaze. <words>101</words>
Flames licked the ink; the wasps uncurled into sparks that spelled impossible chords across the smoke. <words>110</words>
Instead of singing, the bard inhaled the burning music, letting it scorch his lungs until his voice emerged not as melody but as raw order, a lattice of sound that stitched the gale’s howl into measured breaths. <words>125</words>
Chaos, suddenly shy, folded its wings against the airship’s flanks; rain fell in polite, countable drops. <words>135</words>
The poets stared, quills trembling; the captain lifted a brow, recognizing the horizon’s invitation. <words>144</words>
With a shrug that said both victory and apology, the bard stepped onto the observation deck where the sky split open like a theater curtain. <words>156</words>
There, at the lip of reason, he pressed his lips to the bruised edge of the world and tasted every unwritten song at once. <words>167</words>
He did not stay to claim applause; fiercely nonchalant once more, he pocketed the tinderbox, now cold, and descended the gangway onto the next rumor. <words>180</words>
Behind him, the steampunk airship sailed steady, its dining room hushed, the poets already twisting the tale into fresh legend. <words>192</words>
They would say the tuneless bard had swallowed fire and exhaled silence, that he kissed madness and left it blushing. <words>204</words>
Only the stained manuscript’s ashes knew the truth: chaos was never tamed, merely persuaded to dance by someone who admitted he could not lead. <words>218</words>
And somewhere beyond the next cloudbank, the bard walked on, pockets empty of songs but full of sparks, ready to trade another cracked smile for the next impossible page. <words>233</words>
