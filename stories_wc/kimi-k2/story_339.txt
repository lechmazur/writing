The joyless performer stood at the prismatic lake, its surface fractured by cranes and half-built piers amid construction, each reflection a modestly extravagant lie of color over concrete. <words>29</words>
In her pocket she turned a simple drawer knob, the brass warm from her thumb, a relic from the nursery she had abandoned when applause first felt heavier than guilt. <words>42</words>
She had come to organize the shards of memory that clanged louder than any cymbal in her act, to hush the dissonance of old guilt that rose whenever children laughed in the front row. <words>57</words>
Across the churned mud, the echo of a squeaking seesaw in an empty playground reached her, a single note repeating like a question she never answered the night her sister fell and never danced again. <words>75</words>
That night she had chosen the spotlight over the hospital corridor, torn between truths: the stage lights that promised escape and the dim bulb that revealed her cowardice. <words>90</words>
Now caution and abandon braided inside her; she stepped onto a plank bridging water and dust, arms half-raised as if beginning a routine no audience would ever pay to see. <words>105</words>
The knob slipped from her fingers, struck the plank, and rolled toward the lake, its metallic ring swallowed by hammering and the distant seesaw's cry. <words>118</words>
She chased it with the same frantic grace she once used to chase encores, knees bending, wrists flicking, every motion rehearsed yet suddenly urgent. <words>131</words>
When she caught the knob at the water's edge, the lake's prismatic skin stilled for one breath, showing her not the sequined stranger she had become but the barefoot child who believed applause could heal. <words>147</words>
The construction crew shouted warnings, yet their voices blurred into the cautious abandon of her decision; she pressed the knob to her lips like a mute confession. <words>161</words>
She walked back across the plank, each step timed to the seesaw's rhythm, and knelt in the sawdust where she began to organize the fragments: ticket stubs, glitter, a hospital bracelet, all circling the knob like satellites of regret. <words>178</words>
With every item placed, the echo softened, as though the playground itself exhaled. <words>188</words>
She understood then that to hush the dissonance she must perform one last act without spotlights, without applause. <words>201</words>
Standing, she flung the knob high; it arced against the cranes, flashed once, and vanished into the lake where colors folded over it like forgiving wings. <words>215</words>
The seesaw quieted. <words>218</words>
She turned toward the unfinished boardwalk, modestly extravagant in her plain coat, ready to build something sturdier than applause. <words>232</words>
Behind her, the lake kept its new secret, and the cranes resumed their chorus, yet the silence inside her was no longer an empty seat but a stage swept clean. <words>248</words>
