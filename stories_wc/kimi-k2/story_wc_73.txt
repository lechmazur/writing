The infinite staircase spiraled upward and downward without rail or rest, each step the same cold marble, each landing indistinguishable from the last. [28]
I climbed anyway, a grim optimist who believed the next identical turn might still hide the difference that would let me breathe. [42]
In my pocket rattled a pair of dice, one chipped along the three, a flaw I kept like a scar. [58]
They had rolled once beside her hand on the night I left, and the sound of their tumble had been the last texture of her laughter I ever caught. [82]
Since then the staircase had appeared, replacing every door I tried to open, and I walked because walking was the only proof I was still somewhere. [108]
I told myself the motion was perpetual, that ascent and descent were the same equation written in opposing signs, and if I could balance them I could balance regret. [137]
The air tasted of chalk and iron, as though the steps exhaled the dust of erased proofs. [156]
I began to mark them, scratching tiny sigils of probability into the edges: the likelihood of meeting her again, the chance that memory could be solved like a limit approaching one. [190]
Each mark made the next step lighter, as if daring the staircase to contradict the numbers. [208]
One evening—or what passed for evening in the boundless confinement of no sun—I sat and rolled the dice. [235]
The chipped one landed on its ruined three; the other showed six. [248]
Nine, I thought, is the rupture between what was and what could have been. [264]
I wrote the equation on the riser: 3 + 6 = 9, but 3 ≡ 0 mod 3, so 0 + 6 ≡ 6, and 6 is the number of steps between her fingers and mine the last time we touched. [306]
The marble cracked along the chalked line, a hairline fissure that exhaled warm air smelling of her perfume. [330]
I laughed, balancedly daring the staircase to admit its own illusion. [345]
The crack widened into a narrow shaft of amber light, and through it I saw the café where we had argued over whether love could be expressed as a convergent series. [385]
She sat at the table, rolling the same dice, her thumb brushing the chip I had not yet given her. [407]
I reached, but the light wavered, and the staircase shuddered, steps sliding like pistons to close the gap. [430]
I pressed my palms to the moving marble, feeling the texture of missed opportunity grind against my skin. [455]
“Wait,” I whispered, and the staircase slowed, not out of mercy but because motion without resistance is meaningless. [480]
I opened my notebook and began to prove, step by step, that perpetual motion requires an observer to record the distance traveled, and that regret is simply the integral of velocity over a closed loop. [530]
The equations spilled across the risers, each line a rung in a ladder bridging the rupture. [553]
The staircase responded, steps rearranging themselves into the exact slope of her shoulder when she laughed. [575]
I walked that slope, dice rolling ahead of me, their clatter the heartbeat of the proof. [595]
At the crest, the light returned, thinner now, like a filament about to burn out. [615]
I saw her glance up, eyes widening at the dice she thought she had lost. [633]
I reached through, not with my hand but with the chipped three, offering it across the boundary of the equation. [658]
She took it, and the staircase dissolved into the texture of her fingertips brushing mine, rough where the chip had been, smooth everywhere else. [690]
For an instant I stood on no step at all, suspended between the perpetual motion of memory and the stillness of acceptance. [720]
Then the staircase re-formed beneath me, but gentler, each riser inscribed with the final line of the proof: the limit of regret as time approaches infinity is the texture of the moment just before the dice settle. [775]
I continued walking, no longer grim, still optimistic, carrying the remaining die and the certainty that every step was both ascent and descent, balanced perfectly on the edge of what almost happened. [815]
