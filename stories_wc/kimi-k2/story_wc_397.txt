The drift-ice marina creaked like an old accordion at dawn, and Mara stepped onto the pier with the heirloom lace parasol tip clenched in her gloved hand, its ivory ferrule colder than the wind. [34]  
She had come north as a euthanasia tourist, though the brochures never used that phrase; they spoke of “dignity retreats” and “final tide ceremonies,” yet everyone knew the destination was the same. [55]  
After waking up changed—her pulse slower, her dreams filled with the hush of glaciers—she understood that her former life had been a fold in patience, creased and pocketed away. [77]  
Now she volunteered with the disaster relief team that trawled the harbor after every storm, dragging shattered crab pots and splintered masts from the slush, because endings, like flotsam, had to be gathered before they sank. [101]  
The work was simple: haul, sort, burn or repair, while the wind carried the smell of salt and diesel like windborne solace across the empty slips. [117]  
Mara’s mind still gripped reality loosely; sometimes she spoke to the parasol tip as if it were a compass needle, asking it which direction death preferred. [135]  
The other volunteers, wrapped in orange slickers, thought she was praying, and they left her to her silence. [148]  
On the third morning, a trawler named Mercy limped into the marina with a cracked hull and a cargo of refugees from a village swallowed by the ice shelf. [167]  
Among them was an old woman wrapped in a sealskin coat, her breath fogging like a departing soul. [180]  
Mara offered her the parasol tip, saying, “This belonged to my grandmother; she claimed it could hear the sound of approaching endings.” [200]  
The woman took it, pressed the lace against her ear, and nodded once, as if tuning a distant station. [212]  
That night the wind rose, driving floes against the pilings like slow white artillery. [222]  
The volunteers formed a chain, passing sandbags hand to hand, but Mara stood apart, listening. [232]  
She heard the ice speak in a language of pressure and release, a sigh that matched the fold in patience she carried inside her ribs. [247]  
The old woman appeared beside her, parasol tip raised like a conductor’s baton. [257]  
“Your ending is not here,” the woman said. [263]  
“It’s in the listening.” [266]  
Mara followed her onto the bucking pier, past the orange slickers and the shouting, until they reached the edge where black water licked the ice. [282]  
Together they trawled the darkness with the parasol tip, dipping it like a net. [292]  
Each time it rose, a droplet clung to the lace, shimmering with the reflection of emergency lights. [302]  
The droplets sang—tiny, perfect notes of hulls cracking, of hearts stopping, of glaciers calving. [312]  
Mara understood then that the sound of approaching endings was not a single chord but a chord progression, patient and repeating. [325]  
She laughed, and the wind carried the laugh away like windborne solace. [334]  
The old woman handed back the parasol tip. [339]  
“Keep it,” she said. [342]  
“Your work is to stay and listen until the last floe melts.” [350]  
Then she walked into the dark, her sealskin coat flaring like a sail, and was gone. [360]  
Mara returned to the volunteers, who were patching the trawler with plywood and hope. [370]  
She gripped reality loosely enough to see the cracks as seams, the disasters as invitations. [380]  
When the storm passed, the marina lay quiet, its drift-ice rearranged into new, temporary continents. [391]  
Mara opened the parasol tip and held it to the sunrise; the lace cast a net of shadows across the snow. [403]  
In the hush she heard the next ending already approaching, a low hum beneath the gulls. [413]  
She smiled, folded her patience once more, and went to help lift a broken mast from the water. [424]  
The volunteers welcomed her back without questions, sensing she had learned something they might need later. [436]  
Days blurred into weeks; each storm brought new debris and new songs. [445]  
Mara kept the parasol tip tucked in her coat, its weight a reminder that endings were not destinations but companions. [458]  
One evening, a boy arrived clutching a photograph of his grandfather lost at sea. [468]  
Mara gave him the parasol tip and taught him
