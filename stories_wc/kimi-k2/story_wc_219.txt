The luminous skeptic, Dr. Mara Voss, stood at the base of the rainwashed tower in spring, her phosphorescent skin catching the last drops of twilight like scattered coins. [34]  
She had come here after making first contact with the off-world archives, the moment when humanity’s scattered children finally answered back across the dark. [50]  
Their message had been simple: “Return is possible, but only if you understand the chemistry of homecoming.” [66]  
Mara, academically rebellious to the marrow, had refused the sanctioned pilgrimage routes that ferried the faithful in climate-controlled trams. [83]  
Instead, she followed the dusty footprints left on an overgrown sculpture path, a forgotten spiral of bronze giants half-swallowed by moss and memory. [101]  
Each statue depicted a migrant ancestor frozen mid-stride, their faces eroded to suggestion, their hands forever reaching toward a horizon that had already moved on. [121]  
The artificial pilgrimage was a bureaucratic invention, a sanitized loop for those who wanted the story without the sweat; Mara wanted the equation beneath the myth. [141]  
She carried the fly amber in her pocket, a thumb-sized relic her grandmother had smuggled from Old Earth, its imprisoned insect still glowing faintly with Jurassic light. [161]  
Grandmother had sworn the amber was a seed, not a souvenir, and that when the time came it would open only at the tower’s heart. [178]  
Mara’s boots scuffed pollen and rust as she climbed, the bronze quiet of evening deepening into something metallic and intimate. [194]  
The tower’s lower floors were laboratories abandoned decades ago, beakers filmed with mineral tears, centrifuges stilled mid-spin as if the scientists had simply stepped into the rain and dissolved. [216]  
She paused at a bench where someone had etched “Converge” into the wood, the letters filled with verdigris like a secret command. [232]  
Mara traced the word, feeling the tower breathe around her, its stone arteries carrying groundwater instead of blood. [247]  
On the seventh landing she found the first living thing: a single blue orchid threading itself through a cracked retort, petals trembling with condensed stormlight. [266]  
She knelt, letting the orchid’s scent mingle with the fly amber’s faint honeyed pulse, and understood the chemistry of homecoming was not a formula but a fermentation. [286]  
The tower was a still, distilling centuries of departure into a single drop of recognition. [298]  
Higher, the sculptures began to move—not in any visible way, but in the way memory moves when you realize it has always been walking beside you. [316]  
Bronze shoulders shifted, bronze hands almost touched her sleeve, and the dusty footprints brightened as if lit from below by the same bioluminescence that lit her veins. [336]  
Mara’s skepticism flickered; she had built her career on dismantling miracles, yet here was a miracle dismantling her instead. [353]  
At the summit, the path widened into a circular chamber open to the sky, rainwashed and smelling of ozone and lilac. [368]  
In the center stood the final sculpture: a woman with Mara’s face, but older, her palm cupped as if waiting. [382]  
The fly amber grew hot, and Mara, heart hammering, placed it in the statue’s hand. [394]  
The amber cracked along ancient fracture lines, releasing the fly in a shimmer of gold dust that rose and swirled into the shape of a departing ship. [412]  
The bronze woman absorbed the dust, her surface softening until she was merely light, and the light stepped forward and embraced Mara. [428]  
In that embrace Mara felt every mile her ancestors had traveled, every silence they had swallowed, every small refusal that had kept their stories alive. [448]  
The chemistry of homecoming, she realized, was catalyzed by contradiction: the need to leave and the need to return locked in the same molecule. [466]  
The luminous skeptic wept, her tears diluting the bronze quiet into something almost singable. [478]  
Around her, the tower began to hum, a low frequency that rattled the orchid’s petals and set the abandoned centrifuges spinning once more. [494]  
The sculptures on the path below stirred fully now, converging toward the summit, their dusty footprints igniting like fuse trails. [510]  
They did not walk; they flowed, bronze becoming liquid narrative that pooled at Mara’s feet and then rose, weaving itself into wings. [528]  
She understood then that the artificial pilgrimage had never been for the faithful; it had been for the data, the metadata, the ghosts encoded in metal and rain. [548]  
The wings lifted her above the tower, above
