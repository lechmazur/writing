The sewer tunnels beneath the drowned avenues of Viremont still smelled of salt and rust, even though the plague had ended three seasons ago. [28]
I crouched on a ledge of crumbling brick, turning the seafarer’s chronometer cog between my fingers, its brass teeth catching the faint green glow of bioluminescent algae. [42]
Each tooth was a syllable in a language no one spoke anymore, a metronome for ships that would never sail again. [55]
I had come down here to escape the new republic’s loud certainties, the slogans painted over the tide-lines, the rewritten histories hawked from every loudspeaker. [75]
They said the old chronometers were superstition, that time could be sliced into equal, obedient seconds by any cheap quartz chip. [93]
I, a wannabe philosopher with no academy left to scorn me, intended to prove otherwise. [107]
My rebellion was rational: if we let the new regime erase the instruments that once guided captains through typhoon and eclipse, we would forget the difference between measured courage and mere noise. [131]
So I mapped the sunken city ruins through sedimentary layers, counting varves of silt the way monks once counted beads. [150]
Layer one: pre-plague cobblestones, still showing cartwheel ruts. [163]
Layer two: the first flood wrack, toys and bones. [174]
Layer three: a rusted loudspeaker, its final broadcast fossilized mid-syllable. [188]
Each layer contradicted the official narrative that the city had fallen in a single heroic night. [203]
Instead, the evidence spoke of slow surrender, of decisions made in committee, of chronometers thrown overboard to lighten the load. [222]
I recorded everything in a ledger waterproofed with candle wax, my handwriting crabbed but exact. [239]
At dusk I climbed the broken clocktower whose gears now served as gull perches. [253]
From there I could see the new harbor lights blinking in algorithmic patterns, nothing like the warm irregular pulse of the cog I carried. [273]
I pressed the cog to my ear; it ticked with the residual heat of centuries, a heartbeat older than any republic. [291]
That night the patrol boats broadcast their nightly correction: “The past was chaos until we gave it order.” [309]
I spat into the water, tasting iron. [317]
Their order was a grid nailed over coral, sharp and dead. [329]
I descended again, following a drainage pipe that had once been a boulevard of cafés. [344]
Halfway down, I found a skeleton wearing the remains of a captain’s coat, its pockets sewn shut with copper wire. [363]
In the breast pocket lay a second cog, twin to mine, inscribed with the words “Against the tyranny of convenience.” [383]
Holding both cogs, I felt the city’s competing narratives grind against each other like mismatched gears. [401]
One story wanted the city to have died cleanly, a sacrifice. [413]
The other insisted it still lived, breathing through barnacle and rust. [425]
I agonized between them, not out of sentiment but because truth has a tensile strength that propaganda lacks. [445]
If I chose the cleaner story, I could surface tomorrow and sell my findings as a cautionary relic. [463]
If I chose the messier truth, I would remain here, archiving mildew and memory until the tunnels claimed me too. [483]
The abrasive calm of the sewer decided for me: no slogans echoed here, only the slow drip of water wearing stone into shape. [504]
I set the twin cogs into the empty eye sockets of the captain’s skull, a pair of mechanical pupils staring up at the drowned constellations. [528]
Then I began to dig, not with shovel but with patience, through sedimentary layers that recorded every argument the city ever had with the sea. [551]
I uncovered a third layer: seeds of salt-resistant wheat, still viable, sealed in a glass tube. [568]
The old methods were not just navigation but cultivation, ways of living with uncertainty instead of denying it. [588]
I packed the seeds, the cogs, and my ledger into a tin box soldered from bilge plates. [603]
When the spring tide turned, I followed the rising water up staircases that had become waterfalls, emerging at dawn where the new seawall was thinnest. [628]
A guard saw me, rifle half-raised, but I spoke first, voice hoarse from salt and silence. [647]
“Your republic will need these seeds when the next plague comes,” I said, holding out the box. [665]
He hesitated, caught between orders and hunger. [674]
I left the box on the parapet and walked away, chronometer cog
