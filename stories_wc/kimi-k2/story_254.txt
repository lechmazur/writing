The humorless comedic actor arrived at the deserted playground at the edge of the wilderness carrying only an inkwell, dried out and cracked like his last laugh. <words>25</words>
Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry, he felt the swings creak in wind that tasted of iron and regret. <words>37</words>
He had come here to bottle a star's dying breath, though the star had died centuries ago and its gift was unwanted, objectively personal, like every joke he'd ever told that no one laughed at. <words>58</words>
The inkwell had been his mother's, given to him on her deathbed with the words "write something funny," but the ink had dried the day he realized he couldn't. <words>79</words>
Now he unscrewed the cap and stared into the empty glass, seeing only his own reflection twisted by the curved bottom, a funhouse mirror without the fun. <words>100</words>
In the persistent daydream loops that had plagued him since childhood, he imagined capturing light itself, distilling it into something that might make the universe smile. <words>123</words>
But here, where the wilderness pressed against the rusted slide like a predator, he understood that some gifts were meant to be refused. <words>145</words>
The star's dying breath wasn't light—it was the sound of every audience's silence, every review that called him "tragically unfunny," every night he practiced jokes in the mirror until his reflection walked away. <words>173</words>
He placed the inkwell on the merry-go-round and spun it slowly, watching it orbit like a planet around a black hole of his own making. <words>197</words>
Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry, he saw himself at seven, telling his first knock-knock joke to an empty room, the echo laughing back at him in his mother's voice. <words>223</words>
The persistent daydream loops showed him accepting the gift, filling the inkwell with starlight, becoming the clown who made galaxies giggle. <words>247</words>
But he was a humorless comedic actor, and even his fantasies had punchlines that fell flat. <words>265</words>
He picked up the inkwell and held it to the sky, where no stars shone, only the memory of their light traveling through space like a joke told too late. <words>290</words>
The wilderness whispered that some things couldn't be bottled, some gifts were meant to remain unwanted, objectively personal, like the weight of being born to make people laugh when you couldn't even make yourself smile. <words>323</words>
He conceded through the persistent daydream loops, letting them spin out like the merry-go-round until they dissolved into the rust and weeds. <words>349</words>
The inkwell remained empty, but now it held something better than starlight—it held the truth that some gifts are the space where gifts should be. <words>378</words>
Through the hush of time's unraveling tapestry, he left the playground carrying nothing but the weight he'd always carried, lighter now that he'd stopped trying to make it funny. <words>410</words>
The wilderness closed behind him, and somewhere in its depths, a star's dying breath continued its journey, free from bottles, free from jokes, free from the humorless comedic actor who'd finally learned to let the silence speak. <words>450</words>
