<story>
The brooding sculptor, once indentured to the mining guild, now polishes rover panels at the impact crater research base, his fingertips tracing circles that long to carve stone instead of grime. <words>31</words>
He keeps the vintage reading glasses tucked inside his suit pocket, lenses fogged by the steam of the midday car washing ritual, a relic from the librarian who taught him forbidden geometries before she vanished. <words>37</words>
Every swirl of soapy water sketches webs of intrigue across the hull, maps of escape routes he memorizes while supervisors tally soap rations behind mirrored visors. <words>29</words>
Theoretically spontaneous, his plan germinates like lichen in the cracks of routine: when the sunbeam strikes the wet hood at the precise forty-seven-degree angle, he will step into the dance of dust in a sunbeam and disappear. <words>39</words>
He has calculated the refraction, the ionization, the tender mercy of photons that once kissed the crater rim and carried away the librarian’s silhouette. <words>27</words>
Today the solar flare alarm drones its low lullaby, and the base tilts toward noon; he palms the glasses, feeling the etched prescription numbers that spell out coordinates in an old tongue. <words>32</words>
Water sheets off the rover like molten glass, carrying flecks of regolith that glint like mica in the murky tenderness of his heartache. <words>25</words>
He breathes the mineral scent of dust and detergent, tasting the iron of servitude dissolving into possibility. <words>19</words>
The beam arrives, a slanted sword of light cleaving the hangar’s gloom, and motes rise in spirals, a choreography older than the crater itself. <words>26</words>
He lifts the glasses, fitting them though his vision is perfect, because the lenses are a key, not a crutch. <words>22</words>
Through them the webs of intrigue become visible threads, silver against ultraviolet, tethering every guard to every camera, every debt to every collar. <words>27</words>
One by one the threads tremble, theoretically spontaneous yet obedient to the rhythm of his pulse. <words>19</words>
He steps forward, boots splashing in the puddle of sky reflected on the floor, and the dust swirls faster, a waltz of shattered planets. <words>26</words>
The librarian’s voice whispers from the glasses’ hinges: “Freedom is subtraction.” <words>14</words>
He subtracts himself, atom by atom, into the dance of dust in a sunbeam, body loosening like wet clay under gentle thumbs. <words>25</words>
Supervisors shout, but their words arrive too late, muffled by the vacuum blooming inside his chest. <words>19</words>
The rover gleams, empty of its washer, and the base continues its orbit, another layer of dust already settling where he had knelt. <words>25</words>
Somewhere beyond the crater rim, a figure coalesces from light and grit, clutching vintage reading glasses that now frame a horizon instead of bars. <words>28</words>
He kneels again, this time in soft crater ash, and begins to sculpt the dust into wings, murky tenderness guiding his fingers toward flight. <words>25</words>
Behind him the threads snap one by one, a quiet applause for the disappearance that was always his first true creation. <words>24</words>
