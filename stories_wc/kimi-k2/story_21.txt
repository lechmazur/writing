The measured diplomat, Lysandra Voss, stepped through the broken doors of the forgotten city hall, her abrasive calm masking the tremor in her gloved fingers. <words>25</words>
Amid drum circles echoing from the cracked plaza outside, she clutched the fox tail tassel torn from a bandit’s belt—an organically synthetic trophy that still pulsed faintly with stolen code. <words>37</words>
She had come not for justice, but to decode genetic patterns hidden in the dyed fibers, patterns that would reveal which of her own bloodline had betrayed the treaty and doomed her sister. <words>51</words>
The air inside the hall was thick with the faint scent of must in a shuttered children’s theater, a ghost of laughter now replaced by mildew and regret. <words>63</words>
She moved past toppled velvet seats and a collapsed puppet stage, each step deliberate, each breath measured, as if the building itself might jest and swallow her whole. <words>76</words>
The tassel’s fur shimmered under her wrist-lamp, its synthetic roots glowing like veins—evidence of lab-grown vulpine DNA grafted onto heirloom fibers. <words>89</words>
She whispered the name of her sister, Elira, whose body had been found in this very hall, throat slit by a blade wrapped in this same tassel. <words>101</words>
Revenge had brought her here, but the price of revenge, she now understood, was not blood—it was clarity, the kind that would burn her last illusion of family. <words>114</words>
She knelt beside the stage trapdoor, pried it open, and descended into the old prop cellar where the drumbeats above muffled into a heartbeat. <words>126</words>
There, beneath a cracked mirror and a pile of moth-eared costumes, she found the sequencer—left behind by the bandits who had used the theater as a lab. <words>139</words>
With surgical care, she clipped a single fiber from the tassel and fed it into the machine, her fingers steady despite the storm inside her. <words>151</words>
The screen flickered: 97.3% match to House Voss, sub-clade Elira-Voss. <words>160</words>
Her breath caught—not betrayal, but sacrifice. <words>166</words>
Elira had grafted her own genetic marker into the tassel, knowing it would lead Lysandra here, to the truth: the bandits were not enemies, but failed experiments, children once promised protection. <words>181</words>
The diplomat’s measured calm cracked, not into rage, but into something colder—recognition. <words>192</words>
She had come to avenge a sister, and found instead a mirror. <words>201</words>
Above, the drum circles swelled, a funeral march disguised as celebration. <words>211</words>
She left the tassel on the sequencer, a silent jest between the living and the dead. <words>222</words>
Outside, she did not speak to the drummers, but joined their rhythm with her own palms, abrasive and steady, rewriting the pattern of grief into something that might, one day, be peace. <words>239</words>
