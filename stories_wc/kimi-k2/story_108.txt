At the falling star collection point, where wishes cooled like embers on obsidian trays, the vexed minstrel tuned her lute with fingers that still trembled from last night's riot. <words>31</words>
The crowd had demanded answers about the vanished moon, and she had played until her throat bled, yet their madness only grew louder, so tonight she arrived with a different instrument: the confiscated spy gadget pen she had lifted from the Inquisitor's coat. <words>46</words>
Its silver casing felt warm, almost alive, as if recognizing her purpose—to hush the madness in the crowd with something subtler than song. <words>57</words>
She pressed the hidden switch, and from the pen's tip spilled not ink but gifts of the fog: memories of lullabies, the scent of rain on cedar, the hush before snowfall. <words>71</words>
The fog unfurled strategically spontaneous, weaving between the gathered petitioners like a dancer who had rehearsed chaos itself. <words>82</words>
Each person it touched grew still, eyes glazing with private wonder, and the minstrel felt the familiar coy malevolence curl her lips—she was saving them, yes, but also stealing their rage for her own collection. <words>96</words>
From her pocket she drew a small projector crystal, another family tradition of watching a specific movie annually: "The Tapestry Unravels," a forbidden film that showed fate as threads one could tug. <words>111</words>
Tonight she would screen it on the fog itself, letting its images radiate outward like ripples in mercury. <words>121</words>
The first scene flickered: a child catching falling stars in a jar, and the crowd sighed as one. <words>131</words>
She had discovered that within the tapestry of fate, every riot was simply a pattern waiting for the right knot to be tied. <words>143</words>
The minstrel played her lute softly now, not to drown their anger but to guide it, each note a thread pulling them toward calm. <words>155</words>
The spy pen grew hotter, its mechanisms whirring as it translated her music into pure emotion, amplifying the fog's gifts until the square smelled of grandmother's kitchens and first kisses. <words>170</words>
A boy dropped his stone; a woman released her banner. <words>177</words>
The minstrel's vexation softened—not gone, but redirected into the careful work of unraveling violence into verse. <words>188</words>
She thought of her mother, who had stood here twenty years ago with the same pen, the same film, the same desperate hope. <words>201</words>
The fog began to thin, revealing faces transformed—not peaceful, but puzzled, as if waking from a dream they couldn't quite name. <words>214</words>
She collected the projector crystal, the pen cooling now against her palm, and began the walk home where next year's film waited in its velvet box. <words>227</words>
Behind her, the falling star collection point stood quiet, its trays empty, its purpose fulfilled for one more night. <words>240</words>
The minstrel smiled her coy malevolence into the darkness, already composing tomorrow's lullaby for the madness she knew would return. <words>253</words>
