The jaded locksmith, Calder, climbed the last vine-ladder to the labyrinth orchard that sprawled across the colonial town's red-tiled roofs, its peach and pomegranate branches arching like conspirators over the chimneys. <words>34</words>
During painting, when the sun glazed the whitewashed walls the color of old parchment, he came here to forget tumblers and wards and the unclaimed throne of the guild that had once been promised to him. <words>34</words>
Tonight the air smelled of wet clay and turpentine drifting up from the open-air pottery class held on the widow Valdez’s terrace, a demure audacity of art in a place meant for fruit and secrets. <words>34</words>
Calder lingered at the edge, gloved hands in the pockets of his coat, the embroidered gloves—black silk stitched with tiny silver wolves—hiding the scars that mapped every lock he had ever betrayed. <words>34</words>
Valdez spotted him and, with delightfully menacing politeness, invited the stranger to take a wheel, saying the clay would remember the shape of any hunter who touched it. <words>30</words>
He sat, the wheel spinning, and the cool clay seemed to permeate his skin like a confession, forming a shallow bowl whose rim bore the faint imprint of wolf teeth. <words>29</words>
Across from him, a girl with soot-smudged cheeks studied the bowl, then Calder’s hidden hands, and whispered that the guild still kept the throne empty, waiting for the locksmith who could open the king’s reliquary without leaving a scratch. <words>38</words>
Calder’s pulse quickened; he had designed that lock, then been cast aside when the regent feared his knowledge. <words>21</words>
To preserve hunting methods older than iron, he had sworn never again to pick for kings, yet the orchard itself was a lock of living wood and sky, and the throne was the final ward. <words>34</words>
The girl offered him a pomegranate seed glazed in cobalt; eat, she said, and the orchard will show you the key. <words>24</words>
He swallowed, tasting earth and midnight, and the branches shifted, forming corridors that spiraled toward the widow’s kiln where a single brick glowed brighter than the rest. <words>29</words>
Valdez watched, her smile small and sharp, as Calder approached the brick and saw within it the shape of a crown pressed by ancient fingers. <words>27</words>
He could claim it, slide the warm clay crown into the reliquary’s hidden slot, and the throne would be his; yet the embroidered gloves tightened, the wolves biting their own tails, reminding him that every lock exists to keep something wild inside. <words>40</words>
Calder stepped back, bowed to the widow and the girl, and walked the labyrinth paths down through the orchard, leaving the crown to cool, the throne unclaimed, the guild still waiting, and the wolves still running in silver thread. <words>42</words>
Below, the pottery wheel slowed, the bowl stood empty, and the scent of clay continued to permeate the night, a quiet rebellion against every key that had ever turned. <words>31</words>
