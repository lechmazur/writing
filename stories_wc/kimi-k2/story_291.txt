Captain Rhea Voss stepped through the rusted turnstile of the abandoned amusement park, the frayed coil of rope from her prison escape still knotted at her belt like a dare. <words>25</words>
While the orchard cat dozes beneath a dying tree beyond the fence, she feels the calculated wilderness of the place settle over her shoulders like a cloak of static. <words>37</words>
The mirror maze looms ahead, its glass panes fogged with age and something hungrier, reflecting her dark skin and scarred cheek in a thousand fractured versions that sneer back at prejudice she has outrun across galaxies. <words>55</words>
She grips the rope, remembering how she used it to rappel down the prison wall after a guard deliberately accidental left her cell unlocked—an oversight meant to humiliate, not free. <words>75</words>
Inside the maze, cosmic echoes pulse: whispers of every slur ever hurled at her, every door slammed, every starport that refused her fuel. <words>92</words>
The mirrors warp the echoes into shapes—her younger self scrubbing starship floors, her mother’s voice warning her not to dream too loud. <words>108</words>
Rhea refuses to overlook them; instead she walks deeper, boots crunching on broken glass, letting each reflection cut until the pain becomes fuel. <words>125</words>
At the maze’s heart waits a single mirror untouched by grime, its surface rippling like liquid starlight. <words>139</words>
The orchard cat’s distant purr vibrates through the ground, a low guardian hum that steadies her pulse. <words>152</words>
In the mirror, she sees not herself but the spark she has guarded since childhood—a fierce white flame cupped in her palms, defiant against every storm. <words>170</words>
The cosmic echoes crescendo, trying to smother it with doubt, with the weight of every expectation that she should have failed by now. <words>186</words>
Rhea lifts the frayed rope, ties it around her wrist like a promise, and speaks to the reflection: “You don’t get to define me.” <words>204</words>
The mirror cracks, a spiderweb fracture spreading outward, each line a severed prejudice. <words>217</words>
Light spills through the cracks, not gentle but wild, calculated, the wilderness she has become. <words>230</words>
She steps back as the maze begins to collapse, mirrors falling like shards of old fears. <words>243</words>
Outside, the orchard cat opens one amber eye, acknowledging her survival with a slow blink. <words>256</words>
Rhea walks past the dying tree, rope still knotted, spark burning brighter now, ready to pilot her next ship through whatever stars still try to dim her. <words>275</words>
Behind her, the haunted maze burns quietly, its ghosts finally silent. <words>287</words>
She does not look back; the orchard cat does not follow. <words>298</words>
The cosmic echoes fade into the distance, replaced by the steady rhythm of her own heartbeat, a drum of defiance no prejudice can drown. <words>316</words>
Somewhere, a new ship waits, engines humming like the cat’s purr, ready to carry her spark beyond every mirror that ever lied. <words>334</words>
Captain Rhea Voss smiles, the calculated wilderness in her eyes now a map, not a warning. <words>350</words>
