<story>
Sir Rowan, a hopeful knight still smelling of forge-smoke and spring rain, stepped beneath the iron arch of the hedge maze at the exact hush when the last streetlamp guttered out. <words>31</words>
Darkness folded over the city like a secret, and only the pale green glow leaking between the hedges told him the mystic orchard garden was breathing. <words>25</words>
He carried no sword—only a stray jigsaw edge he had found in the ashes of his childhood home, its painted side showing half a sun that would never rise again. <words>28</words>
Rowan believed, cleverly naive as only the young can be, that every broken thing secretly longed to be whole, and that belief guided his boots along the gravel paths. <words>27</words>
The orchard inside the maze was impossible: silver apples chimed like bells, and the air tasted of both honey and rust. <words>20</words>
At its heart stood the Regret Engine, a brass tree whose roots were tubes pumping liquid sorrow, its branches gear-work arms that endlessly rewound memories and spilled them back into the world. <words>30</words>
Rowan’s quest was to reclaim the lost: the laughter his mother never gave, the courage his brother traded for safety, the mornings that had slipped through the cracks of ordinary days. <words>29</words>
To neutralize the machine, the hedge-keeper had whispered, he must sync with the cryptic frequencies that governed its ticking heart—frequencies no human throat could sing. <words>27</words>
Rowan pressed the jigsaw edge to his lips like a whistle and breathed through it; the half-sun vibrated, casting fractured light that matched the Engine’s pulse. <words>26</words>
The orchard answered with agonizing bliss: every apple rang louder, every leaf shivered, and memories not his own flooded his mind—first kisses, last goodbyes, unmailed letters. <words>26</words>
He felt the machine’s rhythm inside his ribs, a second heart grieving in 3/4 time. <words>15</words>
Rowan adjusted the angle of the jigsaw edge, tilting it until the light it scattered locked into the gear-teeth like a missing piece. <words>23</words>
The Regret Engine stuttered, gears grinding against the foreign cadence of hope. <words>12</words>
Liquid sorrow slowed, thickened, and began to harden into amber droplets that held frozen smiles instead of tears. <words>19</words>
Branches drooped, exhausted, as the orchard’s silver fruit fell upward, returning to the boughs they had never truly left. <words>22</words>
Rowan’s own regrets—his father’s disappointed eyes, his own cowardice—rose like steam, then condensed into the jigsaw edge, completing the sun. <words>25</words>
The final click was soft, almost tender, and the maze exhaled a wind that smelled of fresh bread and forgiven rain. <words>21</words>
When dawn finally crawled over the hedges, the knight walked out carrying only the finished puzzle piece; behind him, the orchard bloomed in ordinary green, no longer mystic, no longer needed. <words>33</words>
Somewhere in the city, a streetlamp flickered on, and someone laughed without knowing why. <words>17</words>
Rowan tucked the sun into his pocket, already listening for the next broken thing that wanted to be whole. <words>20</words>
