I do not have a name the government would recognize, only a number on a death certificate issued in error. [17] The ink that declared me gone has more authority than the air in my lungs. [31] Here, in the iron labyrinth of the port city, that erasure feels like a kind of freedom. [46] The tide breathes in, and the world arrives in steel boxes; the tide breathes out, and the world departs. [65] I exist in that rhythm, a ghost haunting the caesura between shipment and dispersal. [78]

My reality is not like yours; it filters through the rust-holes and shadowed canyons of these stacked containers. [96] Sounds bend, carrying not just noise but the weight of their origins. [108] I have a motivation that would seem strange to the living: I wish only to discover the texture of memories, to feel the grain of a past I cannot officially own. [138] My method is to listen. [143] I collect fragments of overheard stories the way a child collects sea-glass. [155] A cook’s lament for a spice he can’t find, a sailor’s boast about a woman in Marseille, a trucker’s tired sigh into a phone—these are my materials. [182]

In a forgotten Evergreen container, smelling of dust and faint, unidentifiable cargo, I perform my single, constant action. [202] I layer. [205] I take the cook’s frustration and layer it over the sailor’s bravado, pressing them together until they form a new, composite feeling. [227] I try to build a person out of these echoes, a patchwork soul to inhabit my nameless identity. [244] The tide is low, exposing the slick, green-bearded pylons and the muck of the harbor floor. [261] The air is thick with brine and diesel, the acoustics of the yard sharp and clear. [277]

I hold the only fragment of my own erased history, the one object that anchors me to the event. [296] It is a small paper label, curled at the edges, peeled from a poison bottle. [312] The skull and crossbones are faded, the chemical name a blur of forgotten science. [326] Was it mine? [330] A mistake? [333] An act of love or violence? [340] The certificate offers no narrative, only a conclusion. [349]

Tonight, a new story washes in with the incoming tide, carried on the raw voice of a woman arguing on the quay below. [370] “You can’t just erase it,” she weeps, her words echoing between the metal walls, “It happened. [386] It was real.” [390] Her pain is a vibrant color, a deep and aching violet. [401] I take it carefully. [406] I layer it atop the poison label, a gauze of fresh grief over an old, sterile fact. [423] I add the memory of a longshoreman I heard this morning, describing the impossible softness of his newborn daughter’s hand. [442] The violet of grief and the warm gold of that remembered touch. [454]

My senses shift as the water climbs the pylons, the waves shushing against the steel bulkheads. [470] The container walls seem to thin, becoming translucent membranes throbbing with the lives I’ve curated. [486] The woman’s sorrow, the man’s wonder, the sailor’s loneliness, the cook’s yearning—they all press in. [502] I feel them coalesce around the label in my hand, giving it a phantom history, a weight, a temperature. [521] The poison is no longer just a chemical; it is a desperate choice made on a night that tasted of salt and regret, a choice made by a hand that was once impossibly soft. [553] It is a memory, textured and sharp, and for a breathless moment, it is mine. [568]

The blast of a ship’s horn, deep and resonant, announces the peak of high tide, shattering the illusion. [586] The pressure in the container recedes, the layered emotions separating back into their component whispers, leaving me alone with the silence and the quiet slap of water. [614] The woman is gone. [618] The tide will now begin its slow retreat. [626]

I carefully place the label back into a small tin box. [638] I have not found my name or my past. [647] But I have touched the shape of a memory, felt its intricate and painful beauty. [661] I will wait for the next tide, for the next story. [672] I will continue to layer, to build, to exist in the spaces between other people’s lives, a conscious erasure in a city of ghosts and goods. [699] And in this towering, transient world, that is a kind of living. [712]
