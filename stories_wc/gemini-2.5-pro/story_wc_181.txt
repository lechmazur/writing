Kaelen, the sole and perpetually bewildered curator of this place, held the object up to the light of a thousand phantom suns. [20] It was a pistachio shell cameo blank, harvested from the Temporal Bough—the one tree in the astral orchard that bore its fruit and its seeds simultaneously. [45] The shell was smooth, iridescent, and achingly empty, a void of potential in a place teeming with impossible realities. [65] All around him, ghost-silver branches blossomed with starlight, their petals unfurling on a breeze that didn't exist, here on this lonely asteroid drifting through the silent deep. [94]

His mandate, passed down from a predecessor he’d never met, was to observe, to prune, to maintain. [112] It was a simple job with simply complicated rules, the first and most important of which was to never, ever try to understand. [135] But that was the one rule Kaelen could not obey; his motivation was, and had always been, to pursue forbidden knowledge. [155] He had to know why a sapling could sprout with the gnarled bark of its own ancient self, or why a blossom might carry the scent of a fruit it would never become. [186] This was the orchard’s secret: a frantic, beautiful chaos governed by nonlinear inheritance, where effects preceded causes and children gifted traits to their ancestors. [211]

The pressure of the paradoxes was building behind his eyes again, a familiar headache that felt like trying to remember the future. [234] He pocketed the cameo blank and retreated from the orchard’s overwhelming beauty, the sheer presence of it creating a state of brightened disquiet that was his constant companion. [263] Kaelen made his way to his small, sterile living quarters and into the one room where the cosmos felt kept at bay: the bathroom. [289] It was a recurring joke he had with himself that his only method for any real clarity was having philosophical breakthroughs in bathrooms. [314]

He braced his hands on the ceramic sink, the cool, solid reality of it a welcome anchor. [331] He splashed his face with recycled water, the droplets clinging to his eyelashes like miniature nebulae. [346] He pulled the pistachio shell from his pocket, laying it on the counter beside the basin. [362] It seemed to hum with a quiet question of its own. [374] He had to inquire, not with words, but with the focused lens of his consciousness. [389] What was this thing he was holding? [396] Not just a seed, not just a potential carving, but what was its role in this temporal knot? [414]

Staring at his own reflection in the mirror, Kaelen saw the pale, confused face of a man adrift. [433] And then he looked down at the cameo, and the breakthrough struck him not like lightning, but like the slow, inexorable blooming of a night-fused flower. [460] The cameo was blank not because it was waiting for a tool to carve a face *onto* it. [478] It was blank because it was waiting for a descendant, generations removed, to one day inherit a face *from* it. [499] Its emptiness wasn't a void; it was a gift, a genetic ghost passed backward through time, an un-memory waiting to be claimed. [522]

The curator's role—his own role—was not to create or to define. [535] He was a conduit, a living moment of transfer between the first and last page of a story he would never fully read. [557] He was simply the space between the tree that bore the shell and the unknown person whose visage would one day grant it a past. [582] The thought was dizzying, a perfect, terrifying loop of logic. [593]

A profound sense of awe settled over his anxiety, polishing it to a gleam. [608] He finally understood. [612] The disquiet was still there, a low thrum beneath the surface, but it was now illuminated by the stark beauty of the system he was a part of. [640] With a steady hand, Kaelen picked up the pistachio shell cameo blank. [652] He walked out of the bathroom and back toward the shimmering, impossible trees, his bewilderment replaced by a new and terrible clarity. [677] The orchard was waiting. [682]
