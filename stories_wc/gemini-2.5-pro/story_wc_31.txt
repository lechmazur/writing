Silas moved along the pier, a phantom preceding the light he carried. [13] Each gas lamp hissed to life under his touch, a small, temporary star against the deepening twilight. [29] Tonight, a thousand other lights were ascending, silent paper lanterns released from the shore, climbing toward the cosmos. [46] They were for the souls lost on the *Aethelgard*, the liner that went down a decade ago tonight. [62] Silas told himself he was merely doing his job, lighting the pier for the tourists who came to watch the memorial. [81] The truth, the one he hid behind, was that his route tonight was a pilgrimage. [96]

He paused at the pier’s end, the salt spray cool on his face, and let his fingers trace the worn brass tag in his pocket. [121] It wasn’t a key, just the tag: Room 313, The Albatross Hotel, a place that now only existed in postcards and on the manifest of the sunken ship. [150] It was Elara’s. [154] She had believed sound possessed a color, a secret hue for every note, and his luminous vow to her, made under a meteor shower the week before she sailed, had been simple: he would find it. [187] He would learn to see her music. [194]

His wandering was purposeful, a deliberate path that ended here, at the edge of the land, during the one tide of the year low enough to attempt the dive. [224] The lanterns above cast a milky, shifting glow on the black water, a celestial river flowing overhead as he secured his rebreather. [245] Each element he checked—the gauges, the seals, the weights—was a fact, a piece of irrefutable truth he used to build a wall against the terrifying enormity of his task. [273] This wasn't about grief; it was about physics. [281] This wasn't about a promise; it was about pressure and oxygen mix. [294]

He slipped into the water, the transition from sea air to the embrace of the deep creating a profound meteor hush that filled his ears. [318] The world above, with its soft lights and softer sentiment, vanished. [329] Down he went, his descent a slow fall through liquid night, the faint, distant glow of the lanterns the only orientation. [349]

The wreck of the *Aethelgard* loomed out of the gloom, a skeletal city asleep in the abyss. [366] He navigated its tilted corridors by memory and the beam of his torch, the silence absolute. [382] His destination was not the grand ballroom or the engine room; it was the ship’s forgotten library. [399]

The doors hung open, an invitation into a strange, suspended world. [410] Books, swollen and soft, drifted in the gentle currents like sleeping bats. [422] Wooden shelves, draped in silt and sea growth, listed like tired old men. [435] Here, in this vault of silenced stories, he switched off his light. [448] Darkness became total, a physical presence against his eyes. [457] He had come all this way, not to find an object, but to signify his devotion, to fulfill the vow in the one place her voice had been forever stilled. [484]

He let himself float in the center of the room, every muscle still, his breathing the only sound. [501] He thought of Elara at her cello, the way her eyes would close as she played. [517] He’d asked her once, what color was that chord? [526] *Indigo*, she’d whispered, *like the moment just before the first star*. [539]

He let the memory of the music fill him, not the sound itself, but the shape of it, the feeling of its vibration. [561] To discover the color of sound, he had to stop trying to see and simply listen to the quietest place he knew. [582] And then, behind his closed eyelids, it began. [590] Not a light, but the impression of one—a deep, resonant indigo, blooming and fading in time with the remembered notes of a Bach cello suite. [615] It wasn't a trick of the light or a symptom of pressure; it was an answer, soft and certain as a held breath. [637] It was the color of a promise kept. [645]

He surfaced hours later, exhausted and calm. [652] The pier lamps he had lit burned steadily, a familiar, guiding line. [663] The last of the sky lanterns had become one with the distant stars, their journey over. [679] The world was quiet, but for the first time in ten years, it was not empty. [695] </story>
