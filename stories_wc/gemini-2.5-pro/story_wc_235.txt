The charcoal stick crumbled against the fragile grain of the birch bark scroll, the sound a dry whisper in the stillness of the mountain ranger cabin. [23] My task, my only anchor, was to distill chaos into narrative, to scratch some sense out of the splintered fragments of my life. [44] It has been my sole occupation since I saw my own grave last autumn, or maybe it was ten years from now. [64] The dates on the stone were the most confusing part, a detail my memory, or my dreaming, stubbornly refuses to clarify. [84]

Sunlight, thick with dust motes, slanted through the grimy window, illuminating the scroll's surface. [99] On it, I had mapped a dream of a city where the clocks ran backward, but today my mind refused the fantasy. [120] Instead, a feral nostalgia gnawed at me, a longing so sharp and savage it felt like a physical hunger. [138] I remembered being a different person, a younger man who believed his timeline was a straight, unbroken line pointing toward a hazy but hopeful future. [163] That memory triggered the familiar sickness: a profound jealousy of my past selves. [176] I envied the boy who scraped his knee on the town sidewalk, his pain immediate and real, not the phantom ache of a future headstone. [201] I resented the young man who first fell in love, his heart’s rhythm dictated by another’s smile, not the dreadful, silent finality of an etched date. [228] They had lived without the burden of this knowledge, this chronologically confused state where yesterday and next week are bleeding into one another. [250]

I pushed the scroll away, the frustration a bitter taste in my mouth. [263] The cabin felt smaller, the rough-hewn walls closing in, each knot in the wood like a staring, judgmental eye. [283] I was a lucid dream chronicler who had lost the thread between the sleeping and waking worlds. [299] My motivation had once been discovery, a sense of jaded wonder at the bizarre architecture of the subconscious. [318] Now, it was just triage, an attempt to order the psychic wreckage before it consumed me entirely. [335] I squeezed my eyes shut, trying to summon a dreamscape, any controlled world but this one. [351]

The memory that came was one of pure, unadulterated flight. [360] It was from a time before the grave, a dream so vivid I had recorded it on a different scroll, one now lost. [381] In the dream, I had stood on this very porch, spread my arms, and simply willed myself into the sky. [401] The memory was so potent, the jealousy for the man who had that dream so overwhelming, that something inside me snapped. [422] It wasn't sleep that took me, but a waking, focused trance. [433] The scent of pine needles and damp earth was no longer just in the cabin; it was rushing past my face. [451]

I was no longer looking out the window; I was above it. [462] I could feel the updraft catch me, lifting me higher and higher until the ranger cabin was a child's block nestled in a sea of green. [487] I could soar. [490] The wind tore at my clothes, a wild symphony against the silence of the peaks. [505] Below, I saw the winding path I had hiked to get here, and for a moment, I saw a younger me walking it, full of a hope I now found obscene. [535] I saw the clearing where I’d imagined the grave might be, a patch of earth no different from any other. [554] From this height, the lines blurred, the jealousy quieted. [563] The boy with the scraped knee, the young lover, the man who saw his tombstone, the chronicler in the cabin—they weren't separate people to resent. [589] They were points on a single, sprawling map viewed from above. [599]

The sensation faded, leaving me standing breathless in the center of the room, my heart hammering. [616] The feral nostalgia was gone, replaced by a strange, quiet awe. [627] The wonder was no longer jaded. [633] I walked back to the table and pulled the birch bark scroll towards me. [647] My hand was steady as I picked up the piece of charcoal. [659] The chaos wasn't a monster to be fought; it was a landscape to be charted. [676] My motivation was no longer about survival, but about artistry. [687] I began to write, not just about a dream of flight, but about the man who learned to soar above his own timeline, to see all the warring pieces of himself as a single, coherent story. [722] It was a strange and fractured narrative, but it was mine. [732] And I was finally ready to distill it. [740] </story>
