Kael’s magnetic boots clung to the basalt of the tidal bluff, a lone anchor in a world that had long forgotten friction. [20] Below, the sea slid against the shore in a silent, unending caress, its momentum carrying it far inland before gravity’s patient pull drew it back. [46] Above, the aurora shimmered, a celestial river of green and violet spilling across the star-pocked dark. [62] He was the elusive eel herder, a title given by ghosts, for no one else was reckless enough to live where the world never stopped moving. [89] His true work lay here, under the borrowed dawn of the sky-lights. [102]

He moved with a fluid economy born of necessity, placing a new stone into the spiral coiling at his feet. [123] It was a shard of obsidian, painted with a silver sigil representing a prime number. [138] This was his method, the only way he knew to quiet the visions: placing painted rocks in mathematical sequences to map the chaotic grace of the cosmos. [166] He was precognitively cursed, his mind a gallery of futures he was powerless to prevent—fractured timelines of ice-slick collisions and silent, sliding disasters. [193] But here, tracing the sacred patterns of the universe, he could sometimes find a signal in the noise. [211]

Tonight, the noise was a scream. [217] A vision had seized him an hour ago, a glimpse of the tide not just rising but climbing, a frictionless wall of water erasing the bluff and the centuries of patterns he had laid upon it. [255] It was a violation of the lingering promise he had made to Elara, his mentor, as she drifted away on a loose tectonic plate years ago: to protect this place, this nexus of energies. [291] She had believed the patterns held the key not to reversal, but to harmony with their new, slick reality. [311]

His own patterns, his beautiful, intricate mathematics, would be swept away into meaninglessness. [325] The vision had been too clear, too certain. [333] He had to do more. [339] From a lead-lined pouch on his belt, Kael poured a tiny measure of collapsed star dust into his palm. [359] The object was impossibly heavy, a thimbleful of night that warped the air around it, its immense gravity a precious, localized anchor. [383] Elara had left it for him, a last resort, a tool for an equation he wasn't yet meant to solve. [405] Tonight, he had no choice. [411] He had to harness the tide itself. [418]

His silver-skinned eels, sensing the shift in his purpose and the wrongness in the coming tide, began to writhe in their deep-water pen, their frictionless bodies tracing panicked fractals in the water. [453] Kael ignored their distress, his focus absolute. [460] He strode to the center of his rock spiral, to the keystone he had never set. [477] The aurora pulsed, the trigger he had foreseen, its light seeming to solidify and press down on the world. [498] He could feel the sea beginning its monstrous surge. [507]

He knelt, the magnetic soles of his boots groaning with the strain, and poured the star dust into the spiral’s empty heart. [530] The dust did not scatter; it settled into a perfect, dark sphere, a miniature black hole that held its ground against the frictionless slide of the world. [557] The mathematical sequences of the painted rocks were not just a map; they were a circuit. [573] The star dust was the power source. [580] As the first wave crested the bluff’s edge, a silent, glassy sheet of annihilation, the energy of the aurora channeled down, caught by the geometry of the stones, and focused into the star dust. [618]

A low hum vibrated through the basalt, a frequency that pushed back against the water’s inexorable advance. [635] The wave did not crash; it split. [642] The harness Kael had forged from rock, light, and a dying star’s corpse created a null-zone, a gravitational eddy that diverted the great tide around the bluff, sending two lesser waves harmlessly down the coast. [678]

Kael slumped to his knees, the vision of destruction replaced by the sight of his salvation. [695] His eels settled, their movements once again slow and hypnotic. [705] The promise he had made to Elara was kept, for now. [716] He had not broken his curse, but he had wrestled one of its prophecies into submission, bending the pattern instead of merely observing it. [739] He looked up at the fading aurora, its light feeling less like a borrowed thing and more like a tool he was finally beginning to understand. [764] The dawn would come soon, but for the first time, it felt like it might be his own. [782]
