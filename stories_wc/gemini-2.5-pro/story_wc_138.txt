Xylos had existed long enough to watch galaxies bloom and wither like celestial flowers. [14] Now, only a profound, star-crushing boredom remained. [21] His home, a prismatic escondite pocketed away in the folds of reality, refracted the light of the ongoing solar storm into a thousand shimmering, agitated ghosts on its crystalline walls. [49] The storm was a rare and violent one, a tantrum of a nearby star that he had been anticipating for centuries. [69]

He sat at the heart of the kaleidoscopic sanctuary, a place no map could find and no eye could see unless it, too, was dimensionally aware. [96] A low hum resonated through the structure, not from any machine, but from the very fabric of the cosmos groaning under the storm's assault. [120] This was the moment his great intrigue would finally bear fruit. [131] Before him, suspended in a stasis field, floated a shard of obsidian metal, a cursed amulet fragment that bound him to the weary chain of cause and effect. [159] It was the anchor of his immortality and the architect of his ennui. [173]

He could feel the universe beginning to fray at the edges, a symptom of the spatial mutiny he had so carefully provoked. [195] It was a rebellion of distance and direction, a quiet unraveling of physical law. [209] For most beings, it would be incomprehensible terror; for Xylos, it was the overture to his masterpiece. [226] His motivation was simple, etched into his soul by eons of hollow hellos and meaningless farewells: to discover what happens after goodbye. [250] Not the goodbye of a lover or a friend, but the final, absolute cessation that had always been denied to him. [271]

The solar storm intensified, bathing his escondite in wavelengths of angry crimson and violet. [285] This was the power source he required. [292] Extending his senses, he began his true work, the method he had perfected over forgotten ages. [308] He reached out, not with his hands, but with his will, weaving the storm's charged particles into the local continuum. [328] He began to manipulate the galactic magnetic fields, using them as threads to pull and twist reality itself. [346] The cursed amulet fragment in its stasis bubble vibrated violently, a focal point for the cosmic vandalism he was committing. [366]

Space was not tearing; it was refusing. [373] A patch of the void just beyond his sanctuary's perimeter simply stopped obeying the rules, its contents folding into an impossible geometry. [394] The hum inside the crystal walls rose to a deep, resonant growl, the sound of hushed thunder promising an imminent, world-shattering crack. [418] The light from a distant nebula suddenly bent at a ninety-degree angle, its ancient image shunted into a non-existent plane. [439] This was spatial mutiny in its purest form. [447]

The amulet fragment pulsed with a cold, possessive energy, its curse fighting to maintain the status quo of his endless life. [467] It was a leash, and he was finally ready to snap it. [478] He poured more of his will into the storm, pushing the magnetic fields past their breaking point. [494] A fissure of perfect, unreflective blackness opened in the space before him. [506] It was not a hole to somewhere else; it was a hole in the concept of "somewhere." [522] It was an absence, a negation, a true and final goodbye. [533]

The amulet flared, a last, desperate attempt to preserve its host, flooding his mind with the agonizing weight of every moment he had ever lived. [556] But his boredom had calcified into something far stronger than memory or pain: purpose. [569] He did not fight the curse; he embraced it, folding its energy into his own being and becoming the master of his own prison. [592] The obsidian shard went silent, its power now his to command. [602]

He rose from his seat, the prismatic light of his home scattering around him one last time. [619] The rift waited, silent and absolute. [626] He did not know what lay beyond it—oblivion, a new state of being, a reality with different rules—but for the first time in millennia, he did not know. [654] The not-knowing was a thrill more potent than any power he had ever wielded. [668] This was the only adventure left. [674] With a slow, deliberate step, he crossed the threshold, leaving behind a silent, shimmering sanctuary to be unmade by the storm. [696] He was going to find out what happened after goodbye. [706]
