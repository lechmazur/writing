  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.6)
    The canyon setting is vivid and purposeful: frost patterns guide her investigation, the creek provides spatial continuity, and the cold night atmosphere mirrors her emotional state. The ledger strip and glass beads function as micro-setting elements that recur with meaning. Spatial choreography (kneeling by creek, following upstream, Jaren appearing ahead) remains clear. The setting constrains her search to physical traces and charges the final image of her pocketing the ledger "the weight of it steady against her thigh."

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.6)
    Winterglass panes, frosted patterns, and heat-mapping device are vivid and purpose-driven. The conservatory's "unshaken marvels" premise anchors Elias's quest and the final glass-strike. Spatial choreography is clean (Elias at glass, Liora behind, device on tripod). The capsized-ship backstory and three-day drift add texture but do not constrain a present choice, slightly diluting economy.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.1)
    The underwater library is vividly particular: "stained glass windows glowing faintly, as if lit from within," "shelves lined with books that had never known the touch of sunlight," and the water parting at the threshold. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the undertaker's professional calm. The recurring lens object charges the final image when placed on the desk, triggering the chorus and glow. The setting pressures his choice by revealing the logbook and broken lenses, making the environment indispensable to closure. Spatial choreography is coherent across the wade and interior moves.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terra-cotta arbor is signaled early, functions as sanctuary and ritual site, and charges the final image when children gather there. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: sun-warmed tiles, oil lamps making the bell glow, scent of lavender, caves below the ridge. Spatial choreography is clear across the arbor, caves, doorsteps, and valley. The bell (micro-setting object) constrains ritual choices and the ridge's history provides social context that guides Liora's declarations. The arbor's curved walls "whispering secrets" verges on stock metaphor but the setting otherwise integrates well.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.2)
    The viaduct setting is vivid and atmospheric—wisteria blooming violet, iron ribs, damp stones—and the camera obscura functions as both tool and constraint, reflecting an inverted world within. Fog responds to Lien's breath, anchoring the method in environment. However, the spatial choreography when the father emerges is vague (direction, distance, how he found her), and the viaduct itself does not constrain Lien's choices or supply resources that alter her tactics. The setting charges the mood but remains largely postcard, not pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.2)
    The living bridge garden is introduced early, sensory detail is vivid and purposeful ("ivy into arches," "willow roots into staircases that spiraled into the earth"), and the oldest willow's roots shape the doorway that delivers Elara into the trapped moment. The garden's leaves brush her arms "like fingers," guiding her through the maze, and the final image returns her to the willow's roots "cradling her like a child"—the setting actively constrains movement and charges closure. Spatial choreography is clean (cottage → central bridge → heart of labyrinth → street beyond the willow door), though the street-scene lacks layered sensory anchoring beyond gas lamps and damp air, reducing the reader's foothold in that pivotal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=7.6)
    The carnival setting is vivid and specific: rusted rides, prize redemption smell, cotton-candy kiosk, Ferris wheel foundation. The piano bench housing keys and the vault's seed jars provide tactile, mission-relevant detail. Chains clinking adds sensory pressure that affects tactics (scavenger detection risk). The final image of dry soil beyond the carnival grounds gives spatial context that charges the closure, making the setting essential to both constraint and thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=7.6)
    The greenhouse's "skeletal ring of rusted metal and algae-slicked stone," shipwrecks "groaning as the tide shifted," and aurora pulsing overhead create a vivid, decay-saturated world. Spatial choreography is consistent: forge at center, notes in a pipe, foil fed into embers. The environment charges the final image—forge heat, aurora light, molten silver—grounding the abstract imprint in tactile process. Synesthetic details ("deep, resonant black of the water, the jagged red of the rust") filter setting through Elias's unique perception. The "ashen forge" as a live heat source that "still glowed faintly" constrains the climactic action, meeting the 9+ threshold for environmental constraint on closure.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=7.1)
    The emerald station tiles, glowing train windows, and golden-hour light create a vivid, color-saturated frame that charges the atmosphere. The jar's physical handling (pulled from the satchel, held up to fading light, glowing through seams) grounds the setting in tactile detail and constrains Lira's movements. Spatial choreography—platform, bench with flowers, train pulling away—remains clear. The fleeting golden sunset functions as a temporal anchor and tightens urgency, though the actual passage of time (minutes? an hour?) stays vague, preventing the timeframe from fully pressuring tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.1)
    The control room is vividly rendered: rust, old paper, dormant dials, flickering bulbs. The melting ice functions as both atmosphere and motif, mirroring Elias's internal thaw. The console and switches constrain his final action—he must stabilize power, adjust dials—so setting shapes the closure beat. Meets the 9+ gate criterion (setting constrains choice at closure), but sensory detail occasionally drifts into catalog mode (eaves dripping, breath fogging) without tight POV filter, capping below 9.0.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.1)
    The rusted library anchors early with vivid specifics ("iron shelves groaning like a shipwrecked hull," "air smelled of damp paper and rust"). The cast and floorboard are handled as tools that enable the discovery, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (desk, doorway, kneeling at floorboards). Yet the stars "burning brighter" at the end reads as metaphoric convenience rather than embodied environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ridge fort, pebble shore, and tide are rendered with vivid, purposeful detail filtered through the oracle's attention. The gold leaf's physical decay (flaking, crumbling) is embodied across beats. The recurring pebbles and the fort's groaning timbers constrain mood and charge the final image when she walks "sure on the stones." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. Minor gap: the storm's return at the end ("softer, as if it, too, had been mapped") asserts change without showing how the map altered the weather.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.1)
    The frozen courtyard supplies vivid, purposeful detail ("shattered mirror," "pedestal of frost") filtered through robotic perception ("hummed at his proximity"). Spatial choreography is clean (pedestal, violin, mop, stones). The ice violin constrains the final choice—he must press his forehead to collapse the loop—satisfying the 9+ gate narrowly. Scope fits single-scene; no occupational depth is needed. Minor: sensory selection leans visual-tactile without embodying robotic processing limits under stress (e.g., sensor overload).

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cinema lobby, projector, and concession stand anchor spatial choreography cleanly. The lens (picked up, turned over, set down between them, slotted back into the projector) functions as micro-setting: it constrains the confession beat and charges the final image when Elias replaces it. The crystal forecourt returns at closure ("whispers softer now") to reweight the rain-washed atmosphere, linking opening to ending with purpose. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency (scent of celluloid and rain, projector hum).

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=7.2)
    The maze is vividly rendered—hedges "sagged with age, their leaves brittle as old parchment," paths growing narrower, roots rising overnight—and it constrains Elias's choices throughout (impassable paths that suddenly open, the fountain as locus). The marbles function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's reverent attention. The garden's living, judging presence pressures every beat and shapes the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=6.8)
    The bioluminescent algae, thermal regulator, and observation deck glass provide concrete spatial grounding. "Mechanically warm" air—a paradox of cold metal and organic heat—constrains Elara's sensory experience and charges the atmosphere. The holographic interface and its shifting light patterns return at the closure beat, reweighting the nexus interaction. However, the station's corridors and containment chambers receive generic treatment; no spatial constraint forces a tactical choice, and the xenos' wings function more as thematic decoration than setting-driven pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.6)
    The flooded opera house with half-submerged pit and warped walls supplies vivid, purposeful atmosphere. Spatial choreography is clear: Lena kneels at pit edge, wades toward the podium, the lantern light bends the walls into corridors. The violin floating in water and the water's surface itself function as micro-setting that constrains her choice to play. Sensory detail (cold seeping through shoes, breath fogging, wood groaning) is selective and anchored to urgency. The setting charges the final image when the water swirls into dancers and the queen, making the environment inseparable from the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mountain weather station, observation deck, valley, and clearing provide concrete spatial anchors that constrain Elias's movement and choices. The rusted tin box and photograph function as micro-setting elements that charge the closure by reweighting his guilt. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: "auroral sorrow of dawn," "trees swaying in the grip of a certainty," "the cold biting through his layers." The illustration's shifting meaning (mystery → clue → reminder) and the clearing's disturbed ground both constrain the final turn. Spatial choreography is clean throughout the descent and excavation.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory detail is vivid and selective: wet concrete, old oil, broken glass crunch, cold air in the tunnel. The beaded valve wheel is handled twice (discovery, offering) and the tunnel barrier's torn plywood matters to access. The mill's "rusted bones" and the control panel constrain the figure's work, shaping Elias's final choice to complete the gesture. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.8)
    The obsidian refuge and overgrown library are rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail: the stone "seemed to drink the water whole," corridors shift and bury sections, creating a living constraint on the keeper's movements. Sensory selection is strong—temperature shifts, scent of decay or bloom, the river's whisper—and filtered through the keeper's priorities. The new book's pristine pages and the way words bleed into the current when placed at the water's edge directly shape the closure action. Spatial choreography is clean throughout, and the setting's instability (the library "ruled itself") applies constant pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sage Ridge is sketched with atmospheric detail (mountains, creek, old oak, meadow) but remains postcard-generic; the cottage's "walls lined with instruments" and the creek's pitch-shift serve mood more than constraint. The curl in the dresser drawer anchors one micro-setting beat, and the meadow eclipse finale uses spatial gathering, but neither the environment nor any tool alters a tactic or charges the closure image with necessity. Sensory selection is pleasant but does not reflect POV urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.2)
    The silo's concrete ribs, spiral shelves, and vibration create a micro-setting that constrains and charges Elara's final choice: she presses her palm to feel the thrum, the shelves tilt toward her, spatial pressure builds to the moment she reaches through the threads. Sensory detail is filtered through her professional lens (she chose it "for its silence, the way the air inside settled like dust on a bronze plate"). The tapestry fragment and diaries function as tactile objects whose physicality—curling edges, singed pages—pressures her perception and the ending image when the dragons' eyes gleam and their bodies unravel to reveal space beyond.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse beam refraction and Fresnel lens directly enable the discovery (loose stone where light bends), satisfying the micro-setting constraint. Blackthorn Isle's fog, rocks, and solitary pub anchor mood and guide Elias's isolation. Spatial choreography is clean (spiral stairs, keeper's quarters, shore). The island itself remains postcard-level—rocky, fogged—without pressure beyond access; the beam's optics do the causal work, lifting the score.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dimensional anchor is vivid ("walls hummed with the weight of unspoken truths," "nexus where realities brushed"), and the loop pedal, palette, and violet constrain ritual choices. Micro-setting qualifies: the palette's "single smear of color" and the pedal's physical presence anchor action. However, spatial choreography is vague—"chamber," "altar," "streets beyond" are named but never staged with distances or layout. The violet spreading across cheeks, throat, hands charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=7.2)
    The glass spire and frozen lake are vivid and purposeful: the spire's "molten" dawn light and the mirrored horizon frame Liora's entrapment. The nautilus shell's ridges cast rainbows onto the glass, charging the final sensory moment. Spatial choreography is clean (palm to pane, shell in pocket, shell to ear). The environment doesn't constrain a present choice but does charge the closure image, meeting the mid-7 threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.7)
    The viaduct is vivid and specific (wet stones, arches humming with energy, ozone and wet stone smell) and recurs at closure to bookend the journey. However, spatial choreography inside the labyrinth is abstract—"streets and alleys branching into infinite permutations" and "the room around them flickered" lack concrete anchors for movement or proximity. The tablet constrains one choice (palm-press triggers the labyrinth) and the door is a physical threshold, so micro-setting does participate. The glowing stone and runes tie viaduct to door to tablet, creating a material through-line, but the labyrinth itself remains a white room of visions rather than a lived-in space with tactile friction.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cavern as an audibly muted space constrains choice: sound is swallowed, forcing reliance on vibration and tactile feedback. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful—"scent of cured hides and aged wood," the needle's dull gleam, the "deep, resonant thrum" felt in bones—and filtered through Elias's tactile bias. The drum skin and broken needle function as micro-setting that charges the final image, though the cavern's spatial choreography remains largely static across the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    The courtyard setting is rendered with strong sensory specificity (damp cobblestones, wet moss, rainwater reflecting stars) and returns at both opening and closing to frame the threshold moment. The storm recorder functions as both professional tool and symbolic anchor, its weight felt in Elias's hand at the final beat. Spatial choreography is clean, though the eastern quarter remains abstract rather than materially grounded, and the mechanical rhythm lacks physical sourcing that would make it a concrete environmental constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terra-cotta grotto is vivid (amber glow, breathing walls, ancient carvings) and grounds the scene throughout. The stalagmite anchors the rope-tying action, and the grotto's pulsing rhythm guides Lirien's steps, constraining her path and charging the final image when walls shimmer like liquid gold. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric but tilts decorative at times; the grotto constrains choice (where to tie the rope) and charges closure (the light eruption), meeting the 9+ test. Starlight anchors the opening but does not return functionally.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sunken greenhouse is vividly rendered with specific, purposeful detail (arched ribs, moss-slick stone, submerged panes catching light). Spatial choreography is clear and the setting shapes Liora's choice to play here for its acoustics. The bowl is dipped into water and held to her ear, a tactile use that involves the micro-setting. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or alter the final outcome—Liora's plan proceeds without friction from the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=7.1)
    The amber grotto's "walls pulsing like a living heart" and "honeyed glow" are vivid and consistent, anchoring the transaction in a charged space. The petal's static electricity and the way veins darken "like ink bleeding through parchment" give tactile specificity. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric postcard—no spatial constraint shapes Liora's choices, and the grotto's warmth in the closing beat is descriptive rather than a resource or obstacle that alters her stance. The body and the petal constrain the transaction minimally (Darian doesn't pull away, but the text tells us he never does), so the micro-setting allowance is only partly satisfied.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=6.2)
    The breezy library and Harbor's Rest Inn are anchored with sensory specificity ("salt-tinged night air," "scent of aged paper"). However, neither setting constrains a choice or charges the final image; the library is largely a search venue and the inn a conversation backdrop. The spatial choreography is clean but setting remains functional rather than integral to the stakes or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.4)
    The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and liquid-silver crater are vivid and purposeful. The arbor constrains the climactic choice (Liora must place the sculpture against it) and charges the final image when her handprint appears. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Liora's urgency. Spatial choreography remains clear across the orchard and crater edge, and the glass-bark world rules stay consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=7.1)
    The rooftop canal system is vivid and specific: damp stone, black water spiraling, carvings of eyes, the pedestal hourglass. Spatial choreography is clean (bridge → spiral descent → circular chamber). The downward canal choice shows setting guiding decision, and the chamber's pulsing walls register pressure. The hourglass itself charges the final image, grounding the abstract "time bent" in a concrete object, which lifts this above mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=7.4)
    The cavern orchard with dripping stalactites is signaled early, recurs purposefully (the steady drip feeds roots, the air thickens, the orchard "sighed"), and the mosaic stepping stones constrain Elias's conjuring method by providing the surface on which he places the glass eyes. The setting enables the ritual and charges the final image when "the quiet pulse of the earth beneath his feet" becomes the sister's presence. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Elias's urgency. The body and immediate tools (glass eyes, stepping stones) function as micro-setting elements that shape the peak choice and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library setting is vivid and purposeful: emergency lights, ventilation shafts, loose floorboards, and the rare manuscripts room all constrain Elias's movements and enable his cache. The body-as-micro-setting works (sneakers on carpet, butter knife prying the board). The scent of lemon oil triggers the mother memory, anchoring reflection in present stimulus. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. However, the setting does not charge the final image—Mara's flashlight sweeps the room, but the physical space does not alter Elias's suspended choice in a way that makes the closure inescapable.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mossy trellis and damp earth anchor the opening; the sapling's iridescent bark and silver-sheened leaves supply vivid, purpose-driven detail filtered through Mara's expertise. Sensory hierarchy reflects her professional priorities (soil coolness, leaf curl, bark texture). The trellis setting shapes her decision to step outside and the rain intensifies during the final beat, yet the environment does not materially constrain her choice—she could kneel in the greenhouse with similar effect, so the micro-setting falls short of charging the closure image indispensably.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal island's retreat-and-return rhythm constrains the painter's movement and charges the final image as the tide comes in, swallowing paths behind them. Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered: "slick trails of salt and secrets," rain pooling in his palms, cave air smelling of wet stone and copper. The brooch functions as micro-setting, its warmth and weight recurring across beats to pressure his choices. The gutted fishing shack and amber-painted cave walls provide tactile specificity that mirrors the story's core tension between preservation and submersion.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cave is rendered with vivid specificity: "bioluminescent quartz pulsing," "stalactites sang," "light bent, warped." Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias's gift (he hears magic), and the largest stalactite's chandelier form anchors the climax spatially. The cave pearl functions as micro-setting, constraining the pilgrim's action and charging the final image when it cracks. Spatial choreography remains coherent, and the cave's "bright darkness" modulates from shy glow to screaming light spill, supporting the tonal premise.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ivory harbor setting is vivid and filtered through Liora's archivist lens—"pale docks slick with residue," "scent of wet stone and distant cooking fires." The watchtower functions as a goal-location that structures the quest. However, the environment doesn't meaningfully constrain choice; doors open when knocked, the third valve sits waiting on a table. The rain-soaked streets create atmosphere but remain postcard-level rather than altering tactics or charging the final image, keeping this below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=7.1)
    The starlit vault, mist, and courtyard manhole are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (mist "like a living thing," constellations etched on metal, scent of "old paper and ozone"). The tunnel's glass jars and the conductor's silhouette provide concrete spatial grounding. The manhole cover constrains the choice—lifting it is a point of no return—and the underground setting charges the final image. However, spatial choreography in the tunnel could be tighter: the woman's position relative to Elias shifts without clear blocking.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=7.1)
    The tower, cliff, and tile are anchored early with vivid, selective detail (salt-laden wind, stone worn smooth, symbols shimmering). Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: the whale songs vibrate through the ocean, the scent of brine carries "something like time itself." The tile constrains the pivotal choice—Elias must press his palm to it to receive the memories—and the final image of him watching stars, knowing he will return, charges the ending. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The setting does not evolve dynamically across beats; the tower remains a static vessel rather than a changing environment that alters tactics mid-scene.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=6.1)
    The prismatic escondite is vivid and visually specific ("light fractured into a thousand hues"), but it functions primarily as backdrop; the crystalline structure amplifies the storm, yet this environmental detail does not constrain Veyra's tactical choices on the page. The amulet fragment returns at closure ("cold and inert") with reweighted meaning, qualifying as micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (table, walls, Kael's approach), and the magnetic fields are mentioned but not integrated into action in a way that alters her moves.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.4)
    The prep room is anchored early (formaldehyde, old roses, steel tables, embalming counter) and filtered through Elias's familiarity ("clung to Elias like a second skin"). Spatial choreography is clean: ink pot on counter, woman at door, pot set "between them." The ink pot's tactile properties (cool, smooth, ink that "didn't dry") constrain Elias's exploration and charge the final exchange. Sensory detail modulates with pressure: the opening catalog narrows to the woman's bruises and the ink's shimmer at closure. Minor slip: "the city hummed with the deathly vitality" is told atmosphere rather than filtered through Elias's perception in the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=7.2)
    Bonsai forests, mountaintop labyrinth, fluorescent lamp, and gilded-leaf paper are vividly anchored and return multiple times. The lamp hum pulses in time with heartbeat and curiosity, creating sensory texture that reflects urgency. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters the ending—props decorate rather than pressure. The body and tool (pen, notepad) are handled but don't force a tactical shift. Spatial choreography is coherent; the piece avoids white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=7.6)
    The container labyrinth is vividly rendered (fluorescent glow, diesel and low tide, graffiti layers, mudflats at low tide) and functions as micro-setting that constrains Elias's search patterns. Tidal rhythm provides recurring environmental pressure and the woman's appearance on a container edge weaves setting into character encounter. The final scratched inscription ties setting directly to the closure image, charging it with prior detail. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout and sensory selection (rust, salt, muck) reflects urgency without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory setting is vivid and atmospheric: cracked dome, salt wind, peeling murals, half-collapsed walls. The cello in the corner is a strong micro-setting element that constrains the protagonist's method and charges the final beat. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting does not, however, pressure a choice with visible cost—Elias explores freely without environmental obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=7.2)
    The raft city is vivid and purposeful: "wooden planks groaning," neon signs, the undersides of bridges and vendor carts all ground the action. The foundation stone chip returns at the ending ("pressed into her palm"), charging the final image with symbolic weight. Spatial choreography is clear throughout—carnival sections, archives, the raft's edge—and the floating setting creates inherent instability that mirrors the gentrification threat. The setting constrains Lan's tactics (graffiti placement, path-blocking) and supplies the resources (carnival performers, cooks) she uses to resist.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.8)
    Lunar setting is vivid and purposeful: regolith texture, Earthrise glare, micro-impacts on the crater rim. The camera (film canisters "thick with weight") and the cobalt strip function as micro-setting elements that constrain choice and charge the final beats. Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory detail reflects Elias's priorities without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=7.4)
    The mist-coated depot, water basin, and sensory details (salt, machine oil, lantern flicker) are vivid and filtered through Elias's tactile priorities. The water feature constrains his method (refraction test) and charges the final image when the drone lands on his palm. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout. The setting actively shapes his verification process rather than serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rusted outpost, frozen lake, and condensation-traced windowpane are vivid and purposeful; the glass pattern becomes a map, charging the ending image. Micro-setting (the phrasebook in her pocket, the atlas page left blank) recurs with meaning. Spatial choreography is clean across the two shards. However, the environment does not constrain a middle choice—Mira moves through the space without friction from cold, tool limits, or access barriers—so the 9+ gate (constraint or choice-forcing) is not met.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archway functions as fulcrum and resonance gate, pressuring the tuner's movements and charging the final hum; the cobblestones track his ritual pacing and shimmer at closure, constraining method and elevating the ending image. Sensory detail is filtered through craft expertise (patina, tines, vibration, shimmer) and selective—dust motes, wind, stone texture—without catalog bloat. The "fault line…of time" and the town's spatial grid (three steps north, seven east) guide the tuner's choices on the page. Micro-setting (ebony fork, cobblestones, archway) shapes both tactic and final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.1)
    The underwater temple is vividly rendered with purposeful detail: coral-encrusted spires, mosaic floor, statues with outstretched hands, and the ceiling lost in darkness. Sensory hierarchy filters through Lira's urgency (oxygen gauge, rebreather seal, the taste of incense). The perfume vial functions as micro-setting/object-as-setting, constraining her final choice and charging the closure image when its scent spills out. Spatial choreography is clean throughout; the temple's architecture guides movement from threshold to corridor to final chamber. The setting pressures choice directly: the abyss and oxygen limit create a ticking constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=6.9)
    The lighthouse prison, jagged reef, and slick walls anchor early; the warped confessional lattice, copperlight hallway, and shattered lantern room constrain Elias's path and choices (he enters the warden's quarters, climbs to the lantern room). Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("air tasted of copper and old pennies," "floorboard creaked"). The lattice in his pocket is handled twice (pressed against palm, burns and shatters) and the shattered mechanism in the lantern room charges the final image when the beam flickers. Spatial choreography is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.8)
    The greenhouse is concretely anchored (frosted glass, metallic tang of magic, gnarled apple tree roots) and constrains Liora's search among the rows. The bead—warm in a cold space—functions as micro-setting that charges the closure image and forces the memory-confrontation. Sensory hierarchy reflects POV (scent of dormant blossoms, sight of ashen veil, tactile warmth). The setting's "time moved differently—slower, thicker" primes the recursive-memory logic without becoming expository.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.1)
    The red canyon walls and labyrinth are vividly anchored with specificity (ribs of a sleeping giant, threads crisscrossing). The needle constrains a choice—picking it up triggers the voice and drives her to the loom. The woven chamber at the center charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (salt-stiffened air, orchid-scented wind), though spatial choreography of the labyrinth paths could be clearer.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=7.4)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly anchored with pomegranate roots coiling around skeletal fingers, frescoes, bone mosaic, and the central pedestal depression. Sensory detail (myrrh, damp earth, stale air, light bleeding from frescoes) is purposeful and filtered through the protagonist's archeological focus. The pedestal's shallow depression directly enables the sundial placement, and the orchard's spatial layout (entrance fissure, first tomb, central chamber) guides the discovery sequence. The setting constrains the search and charges the final image with the blooming roots.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.2)
    The golden arcade is vividly anchored with specific sensory detail (polished floors, vintage cabinets, dawn light as "liquid honey") and the setting's suspended-in-time quality supports the futuristic-nostalgia tone. The chalk on the floor and the dawn glow provide concrete constraints that guide Elias's decoding actions. However, the arcade functions primarily as atmospheric backdrop; the choice to meet "where the golden light begins" is decoded rather than dramatized as a tactical decision shaped by spatial pressure. The clipboard and Pac-Man machine are handled but don't alter his options at the closure beat.

    The cobalt observatory is anchored early with specific details (domed roof, eternal candle, parchment smell) and the autumn leaves signal timeframe. The observatory's isolation is noted but never constrains a choice on the page—Liora leaves easily the next morning. The eternal candle appears in two beats (opening and final window scene) and gains slight thematic weight as a "silent witness," pushing it past ornamental. Spatial choreography inside the observatory and in the city streets remains coherent, though the tavern is generic.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.6)
    The mangrove setting is vivid and purposeful: twisted roots, slick boardwalk, brackish water, condensation spelling messages. The shard is handled repeatedly (pressed to wrist, pulsing warm, pocketed), and its warmth constrains her attention and charges the closure. Sensory detail is filtered through Liora's focus (humid air, salt-softened paper, cool moisture from the apparition's touch). The environment actively shapes the scene—spirits sing from the water, condensation writes messages—grounding the supernatural in tactile immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mist-clad atrium at twilight is vivid and spatially coherent: balustrade, courtyard below, cold marble, swirling wind. The brain coral fragment's porous surface and fractal patterns recur with sensory specificity (warm throb, heat seeping), and the cast's rough plaster anchors Lena's embodied experience. The setting allows the final alignment moment (Lena crouches, boy mirrors, their casts meet), directly enabling the closure image. The atrium functions as micro-setting that charges the final beat, meeting the 9+ test narrowly, though the disputed atoll and field hospitals remain postcard mentions without tactical weight.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=7.8)
    The orchard district is rendered with vivid, purpose-driven detail: skeletal trees, thick fog, crumbling cider house. Sensory selection coheres (fog curling, light slanting like liquid gold) and the ruined setting mirrors the theme of lost-then-recovered joy. The fresco fragment and makeshift darkroom van anchor micro-setting choices. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (orchard → van darkroom → return to wall). The setting constrains Liora's method (waiting for fog-diffused light) and charges the final image when she pins the print to the same wall.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=6.7)
    The sound wave garden (parabolic dishes, resonant tubes) and scaffold are vividly rendered and recur across beats; the garden's autonomous movement (dishes tilting, tracking breath) creates atmospheric pressure. The hobo nickel's carved eyes and the glass barrier are tactile anchors. However, the garden does not constrain a choice or alter Elias's tactics—it amplifies and reflects but does not force a decision. The final image charges via the trumpet lifting from the wall, but spatial dynamics (scaffold groaning, glass cracking) remain reactive rather than shaping the protagonist's options.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting that constrains and enables: the controlled chaos of orchids and vines directly supplies the transmission method. Sensory detail is purposeful (humid air, cicada drone, gourd symbols shifting under fingers) and filtered through urgency. The spatial choreography remains clear across moves, and the final image of gardens "talking" charges the setting with consequence. However, the regime's surveillance mechanisms remain somewhat generic—"thoughts taxed" is evocative but the practical enforcement beyond soil testing stays vague.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=7.6)
    The gargantuan shell is concretely realized: porous walls as pinhole cameras, spiraled chambers, ancient bones creaking. The shell constrains Elias's experience—he came here because "time moved slower than his thoughts"—and the projections guide his emotional arc from fractured self-image to collaborative dance. The tidepool, brine air, and crushed coral anchor sensory specificity. The wind slipping through wall-holes becomes the medium for the lullabies, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal library, glass orchids, and bamboo tube supply vivid, purposeful detail. The museum of extinct feelings and the cracked tube constrain Liora's method and charge the ending when the orchid chimes in response. Spatial choreography remains clear; the atrium, stacks, and lowest level anchor movement. The setting's fantastical logic (floating library, glass flowers as sound vessels) is internally consistent and integral to the preservation premise.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archive is vividly anchored as a "mausoleum of extinct syllables," and the glass ink well functions as both object and setting-constraint, its pulsing and eventual shattering altering Elara's options and charging the final image. Spatial choreography (desk, shelves, floorboards, doors) tracks cleanly. Sensory detail is filtered through Elara's scholarly focus (fogging breath, iridescent shimmer, jagged shadows). The ink well's tactile presence—dipped quill, rippling surface, swirling storm—grounds the arc and constrains the climax, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The amphitheater's "slow, rhythmic sigh of shifting stone" and "uneven, strained" breath create atmospheric pressure that mirrors Mira's internal state. The surveyor's chain as micro-setting object is handled twice and charges the final image when coiled around her wrist. Spatial choreography (steps, stage, dust) remains clear. The volcano's subterranean springs function as constraint shaping her floodgate work, lifting setting into active pressure rather than postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.6)
    The attic is vividly rendered—warped floorboards, yellowed paper, skylight rectangle, dust motes—and functions as a crossroads that constrains Elias's choices (hidden ledger behind false panel, Lena's entrance). The meteorite and ledger are handled across beats, grounding abstract pursuits in tactile objects. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting charges the final image (pigeon on windowsill, light on meteorite) and the sense of "ruin and resurrection" tonally supports the arc.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.2)
    The drifting prism terrace is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (fractured light, glass tilting underfoot, warm wood grain). The environment charges the final image when Elias sets the prism back and its grain "runs straight," a micro-setting shift that encodes his internal resolution. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The setting does not constrain a key choice during escalation—Elias traces and reflects but the terrace's instability never alters his options mid-scene—which holds the score below 7.5.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underwater facility is vividly rendered through bioluminescent algae, rebreathers, and murals, and the setting pressures movement (spiral staircase, observation dome, central chamber). The burnt feather glowing and casting patterns transforms the dome into a navigational tool, directly enabling the climax. Spatial choreography remains clear across multiple locations within the facility.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=7.2)
    The iridescent cave is vividly rendered with bioluminescent algae, crystal facets, and spatial progression (center → tunnel → chamber). The crater glass glows and shifts color, guiding movement and reflecting interiority. The final chamber's "perfect, unbroken dome" and obsidian seed anchor the closure image. The setting constrains choice (the tunnel narrows, air thickens) and charges the final moment, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tidal arcade is vividly rendered with salt-bleached wood, shallow water, and reflected stars. Setting constrains the performance space and provides props (lantern, stalls). The body and lantern function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image. Sensory detail is strong but occasionally tilts toward postcard ("sky smeared with stars"). The arcade's "lightly attentive" quality anthropomorphizes setting in a way that supports tone but borders on precious.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=7.6)
    The twilight garden is vividly rendered with salt-laced breeze, moss-slick stones, and overgrown vines, and it constrains the scene spatially (kneeling on stones, emerging from undergrowth). The moonstone speck and the garden's dusk-to-dark progression charge the final image when "the stars sharp as shattered glass" frame the completed tattoo. Sensory hierarchy is strong: Liora notices tidal rhythms and star-gaps through her dancer's lens. Minor slip: the ink's material components (crushed pearl, salt tears, moonstone dust) are declared but not shown being mixed or applied, reducing tactile grounding at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=7.2)
    Pearl Bay at dawn is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (mist curling, spectral shards, salt and old paper scent). The prism atrium's glass panes and shallow pool are concrete and purposeful, constraining Elias's final action (throwing the stone into the center). Spatial choreography is clear (docks, narrow walkway, interior ledgers), and the setting charges the closure image. The bay's stillness and the atrium's geometry actively shape the story's pressure, elevating this category.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=7.1)
    The moonlit ridge, cracked porcelain box, and notebook-as-tool all appear and recur with purpose. The box's "fractures that caught the light like shattered dreams" and the notebook's marginal poetry constrain Elias's approach (translate pain through writing). The final image—ink bleeding "like water through cracked earth"—charges closure by tying the stranger's stolen voice to Elias's own scars. Spatial choreography (path, rock, hood pulled back) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=6.7)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with tide-polished quartz, bioluminescence, and Fibonacci shell spirals. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through Elara's mathematical lens. The gauge and shells are handled tactilely across beats. However, the environment does not constrain a key choice—Elara arranges shells freely and the gauge "responds" without her agency altering the outcome. For 9+, setting must pressure a choice or charge the final image; here it remains atmospheric scaffold.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ivy-veiled passage is rendered with strong sensory detail—warm stone, feverish vibration, leaves blackened at edges—and the setting constrains Elias's path (low ceiling, twisting corridor, door at the end). The film negative, diaries, and glowing symbols anchor the micro-setting and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean and the ivy's trembling without breeze adds situational pressure. The passage functions as more than backdrop; it pulses with agency, hums, and remembers, directly shaping Elias's choices and the closure moment when he reaches toward the map etched into the floor.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terrace setting is vivid and consistent: "stone railing slick with the afternoon's last rain," prism parapet scattering rainbows, and the hush before bells all anchor time and space with sensory specificity. The prism parapet functions as micro-setting, supplying the refracted colors Liora paints with and charging the final image when the mirage sharpens. Spatial choreography (Liora at the parapet, watchman at the edge) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.1)
    The terrace anchors who/where/when early and sensory detail (jasmine, cicadas, singed treaty edges) is selective and purposeful. The clipboard's heartwood origin and the terrace's historical truce site add texture, though the celestial alignment remains decorative. Spatial choreography is clear (Liora at edge, Kessar emerging, both turning toward altar). The clipboard's weight and the coin's warmth are micro-setting elements that charge moments, though neither constrains a choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.2)
    The salt flat is vivid and selective—crystalline crust, cracked riverbeds as map, sickly moonlight—and the convergence circle spatially anchors the climax. The egg's warmth and the static-laden air create sensory texture filtered through Elias's perspective. The setting constrains his route (following the crack-map) and stages the final placement, meeting the 9+ gate test for choice constraint and closure charge.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=6.4)
    The silver courtyard and prism sanctuary are vividly rendered with strong visual specificity (snow glinting "like shattered glass," crystalline walls "fracturing" starlight). The sanctuary's thread-knot functions as a tactile micro-setting that Liora must physically engage. However, the environment does not constrain choice—Liora's bare feet in snow carry no consequence, and the threads untangle on cue without spatial or physical friction. The setting provides atmosphere but does not pressure tactics or charge the final image beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.7)
    The dome's curved walls and acoustics are vivid and purposeful ("swallowed sound," "breath sound like a whisper from the heavens"). Sensory detail is selective. The candle and shadows charge the final image, and the dome's history (listening for enemies) mirrors Liora's work. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting constrains atmosphere but does not alter a tactical choice on the page, capping the score below 9-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.2)
    The verdant grotto is vividly rendered with moss, mist, and ferns; sensory details are selective and atmospheric. Spatial choreography (stacked stones, reed lattice between saplings) remains clear. The grotto's suspension "between earth and sky" and the monarch migration's temporal pressure create mild constraint, though the environment does not materially narrow Liora's options or alter her tactics. The setting charges the final image but does not force a choice, placing it in the strong mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=7.1)
    The icebound sanctum and aurora are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Elias's attention ("emerald veins pulsing," "ice seemed to sigh"). The rope's texture—"fibers yielding only when warmed by his breath"—functions as micro-setting that constrains his gesture. The final image of the aurora pulsing brighter charges the ending, meeting the 9+ gate criterion for this category, but the sanctum itself provides no spatial constraint or obstacle during the central action, which limits integration to atmosphere rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bunker's vine-draped decay and the rewilded forest are rendered with purposeful sensory detail ("wet earth and ozone," "roots reclaiming concrete"). The wafer seal's brittle wax and the oak's shimmering bark function as micro-setting elements that guide the closure beat. Spatial choreography from bunker to forest to hidden door remains clear. The storm's approach provides atmospheric pressure but does not materially constrain a choice at the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=7.6)
    The palace setting is vivid and specific: lapis lazuli tiles, cracked urns, myrrh, the throne room's oculus. The "between regimes" frame applies pressure by opening the space temporarily and making scavengers and mercenaries imminent threats. The tile as micro-object constrains the astronomer's actions (he must uncloak it, recite over it, place it in the figure's hand) and charges the final image when it becomes an "unremarkable shard." Sensory selection is strong—dim light, flickering surfaces, dusky air—and filtered through the astronomer's scholarly attention. The mercenaries' approach provides spatial urgency without overwhelming the quieter ritualistic core.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Soundless Sanctuary is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail: walls breathing, floor tilting, mist, silence as active presence. The music box cylinder pin constrains Elara's opening state and returns at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The sanctuary's shifting properties directly enable the cellular-memory transfer, meeting the micro-setting constraint test for high-band entry.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.8)
    The ruined orchard, fog, frost-kissed grass, and glass mountain are vivid and purposeful. The glass mountain constrains the climb and sings under his boots, charging the final image when it dissolves into mist. Sensory detail (fog curling, twilight frost, wind-through-chimes sound) is filtered through the mirror maker's perception. Spatial choreography remains clear across the cottage, path, and summit. The sextant as recurring small object charges both the opening and the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cathedral-orchard hybrid is vivid and specific: moss-covered pews, skeletal rafters heavy with peach blossoms, dappled light. Micro-setting qualifies—the low-hanging bough enables the girl's perch and frames the exchange. The orchard's remembered vows and the pendant's fracture in sunlight charge the final peach handoff, making the setting an active constraint on tone and closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (Liora steps over pew, girl hops down, both handle objects). The setting reweights "persist" through the trees that outlasted their makers.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.2)
    The astral orchard—trees rooted in cracked asteroid surface, branches twisting toward starlit sky, blossoms that hum and fruit that ripens in reverse—provides vivid, purpose-driven detail that charges atmosphere. The bathroom as micro-setting (water from underground springs, shimmering starlight) grounds the pivotal inquiry beat. However, spatial choreography between gallery and quarters is vague, and the orchard's physical layout (distance, access, window sightlines) remains unclear when the trees "bend toward her" at closure. The cap from Q2's orientation penalty applies, limiting this to 7.0 maximum.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=7.1)
    The labyrinthine bookstore is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (aged paper, creaking shelves, symbols that ache). Spatial choreography is clear through the descent. The botanical diary constrains one choice (the renegotiation) and charges the sister's drawing at closure, satisfying the micro-setting test. Elara's botanical expertise filters perception appropriately. Strong execution of purpose-driven detail.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.1)
    The carnival ship setting is vivid and purposeful: rusted hull, frozen carousel horses, collapsed fortune teller's tent, funhouse mirrors that show fractured reflections. The fog and lower-deck labyrinth contribute atmospheric pressure. The emerald swatch card is handled across multiple beats, its "unnaturally cool" texture anchoring Elias's physical experience. The garden's vines of "whispered names" and mist-dissolving petals charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting/object constrain or charge closure. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the descent.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=6.7)
    The clock tower mechanism room supplies atmospheric texture (oil, parchment, gears humming), and the rope becomes a tactile anchor across multiple beats. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the room doesn't constrain her choices—she can work uninterrupted, and the door's vanishing at the end is convenient rather than a pressure that shapes tactics. Spatial choreography is clear but the environment doesn't charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.1)
    The harmonic caves constrain movement (shifting ice, hidden passages) and the bloom's fragile nature shapes the final choice. Sensory detail—humming walls, misting breath, frost curtain—is vivid and purposeful, reflecting Ryn's professional focus on sound and pattern. The stone as micro-setting object charges the closure by vibrating erratically when the beings sense her. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The gently luminous glow is mentioned but does not constrain action beyond atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=7.4)
    The glass humming pavilion is visceral and distinct: walls that sing, cracked panes, warped table, alkali crust. Sensory details are filtered through Elias's custodial familiarity (lighting lanterns, boots on broken glass). The prism constrains his route—he must climb the platform, turn the shard to fracture light—and the final image charges when the pavilion's hum softens in acknowledgment of his departure. Spatial choreography is clear; no impossible positions or prop teleportation.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stormlit observatory and crystal forecourt are vividly rendered and atmospherically consistent. The three monuments structure the progression: obelisk with too-long shadow, smooth stone with sharp shadow, and the shadowless third monument that triggers the climactic whisper-chorus. The third monument's pool of light directly enables the final revelation, constraining Elara's approach and charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.2)
    The blooming fortress functions as both setting and constraint: its stone petals control light entry, alcoves hold unlit torches, and the dais is the performance stage. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Liora's craft perspective ("kerosene rag knot," "wicks brittle with disuse"). The final glow—"the fortress glowed like a lantern in the dark"—charges the closure image, connecting setting to thematic reweighting. Spatial choreography is coherent across the climb to the dais and the igniting of torches.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: "damp walls glistening like the skin of a sleeping beast," "lacework of salt crystals." The tidal pool constrains Liora's action—she places the cicada back into it, watches it sink—and the setting charges the final image: she climbs back "toward the surface." Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The stars function as witnesses in the opening and closing lines, a purposeful reprise that reweights the frame.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=7.4)
    The inverted world is vividly rendered: clouds as ceiling, vines like fingers, silence that "tastes like ozone and possibility." The trellis itself acts as micro-setting, its spongy vines and groaning structure physically present under Liora's feet. The porcelain doll's growing weight and the shift in gravity pressure her movement. The sensory hierarchy (listening to "flavors of different silences") reflects her bunker-trained attention. The trellis constrains her path and charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=7.2)
    The drifting prism terrace is vividly rendered (fracturing sunlight, floating lanterns, water lapping) and the storm glass's liquid states mirror emotional beats. Spatial choreography is clean—gondola, walkways, water—and sensory detail (gold glow, water rhythm) is filtered through Elias's professional attention to sound gaps. The terrace's prismatic light "flickered, as if reacting to her tension," subtly externalizing pressure. However, while the setting charges atmosphere, it does not materially constrain a choice; the woman's breakthrough could occur in any quiet space, slightly limiting the environment's indispensability to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=7.1)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall, silver-leafed trees, and spiral staircase are vivid and support the futuristic-nostalgic tone. The ruby flake detaches and the bark peels to reveal murals, both micro-setting details that enable progression. Spatial choreography is clean—Veyra steps through the veil, brushes bark, descends, and approaches the throne—without impossible positions. However, the orchard does not constrain a choice or charge the final image with cost; it provides a series of discoveries rather than a crucible that forces a trade-off.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ashen sanctuary, doorknocker ring, and starlight lattice establish vivid atmosphere and recur with purpose. The scar functions as micro-setting, constraining the final choice when the keeper touches it. Spatial choreography is clean (threshold, door, child's outstretched hand). However, the setting remains largely decorative between opening and ending; the walls "press in" and the ring "clatters" but these do not alter tactics in the middle beats. The final touch charges the image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but mid-scene passivity and one stock phrase ("edge of the world") hold the score in the 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm delivers vivid, purpose-driven detail (mycelium mats, ozone, spiraling growth) that charges atmosphere and supports the "concepts become physical" frame. The submarine porthole embedded in the tunnel wall serves as a micro-setting constraint that focuses the climax. Spatial choreography remains clean through the descent and return, and the sensory hierarchy (blue light, damp earth, warmth of the bolt) reflects Elias's urgency without catalog padding.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sepia reading room is vividly anchored with selective sensory detail ("golden shadows stretching like fingers," "creak of settling wood"). The bridge and gramophone handle are used tactilely across multiple beats, constraining Elias's physical position and enabling the climactic revelation. The setting charges the final image when manuscripts rearrange and shadows coalesce, making the environment integral to the discovery mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=7.1)
    The alchemical orchard is vividly rendered with pulsing fruits, silver-leafed vines, and fogged glass. Spatial choreography is clean (bench, flagstones, trees, glass panes). The setting pressures Aldric by its reality-thinning properties and charges the final image with marionettes visible through the glass. This elevates the category into the 7s, though the orchard's mechanics (how it thins reality) remain decorative rather than constraining a specific tactical choice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.1)
    The file room's "yellowed paper and old glue" and "dust patterns" anchor setting early and the button's brass tarnish provides tactile detail. The boarding house "crumbled facade" mirrors memory decay purposefully. Spatial choreography is clean across two locations. However, the file room does not constrain Elias's choices—he moves freely from archive to boarding house without logistical friction—so setting remains atmospheric rather than pressure-bearing, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=7.1)
    The auric lagoon's golden shimmer and the puddle-map anchor the opening and guide Lira's path, constraining navigation. The maintenance hatch, tunnel water, and humming servers ground the infiltration with tactile, sensory specifics. The starlight filtering through grates in the final beat charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear (reeds → hatch → tunnel → chamber → doors burst open), and the environment supplies both clue (puddles) and obstacle (enforcers).

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto's bioluminescent moss and "prismatic light" constrain Elias's choice of venue and charge the atmosphere throughout. The saxophone itself functions as micro-setting: its polished surface catches light, reeds tremble, and dewdrops form on it, grounding tactile interaction. The mist thickens "in time with the music," responding to action rather than serving as static backdrop. Spatial choreography (conservatory loomed ahead, grotto, then morning light) tracks cleanly. The grotto and instrument together meet the 9+ gate by constraining venue choice and charging the final departure image.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.2)
    The ashen arbor is vivid and present across beats (roots, branches, leaf-fall rhythms). The moonstone dust speck functions as a recurring object that multiplies and charges the monument-building sequence. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Liora's actions (sorting, building monuments, arranging leaves) proceed unimpeded. Sensory detail is selective (moss, silver dust, pale blue glow) but largely decorative; spatial choreography remains clear.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=7.4)
    The subterranean waterfall supplies the gateway constraint, its roar and mist charge the descent, and the compass rose glows in response—environment shapes the pivotal choice to step through. The workshop's oil-and-rust scent is filtered through Elias's dulled perception ("long since stopped registering"), and the neglected greenhouse's cracked glass and twisted vines supply spatial choreography for the trapdoor discovery. The clockwork city's synchronized figures and smoke-wreathed towers provide sensory specificity that charges the final image. Spatial tracking is clean across all transitions, and the waterfall's mist "swallowing him whole" directly enables the world-shift that defines the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rain-washed foundry supplies recurring pressure: sagging beams, damp iron, ash-covered anvil. The zodiac coin—warm, scratched—functions as micro-setting that constrains the search and charges the final exchange. Sensory detail is vivid and selective ("scent of damp iron and old charcoal"), filtered through Liora's alchemical lens. The carved name on the anvil becomes a spatial anchor that reconfigures her understanding, meeting the 9+ gate criterion of environment shaping a choice and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.1)
    Echo Gorge is vividly rendered with breathing cliffs, damp wind, wet stone, faces in walls, and the misaligned harp's distorted notes. Sensory details (scent of sorrow, sky bleeding pale glow, damp earth under boots) are filtered through the collector's weary, professional attention. The setting constrains the encounter—spectral confessions come *here* in this hush—and the "hidden sunrise" frames the woman's dissolution, charging the final image with gold and rose light. Spatial choreography (his shadow falling, sitting beside her, standing at closure) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid and purposeful: trees pulsing violet, resin contact triggering phantom pain, geometric grid transformation. Sensory detail (ozone, metallic blood smell, slick bark) filters through Elias's trauma-tuned perception. The forest constrains his movement ("braced himself against a tree") and the geometric shift after drinking the vial charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate criteria for environment shaping the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.1)
    The alchemist's market "strung from the rafters" and "time pooling" create vivid atmosphere, and the fragment's vibration anchors micro-setting when pressed to her wrist and later fastened into the locket. The painting of the submerged lighthouse charges the closure by providing the map she traces. Sensory detail is selective (salt, burnt sugar, brine) and filtered through Liora's translator lens, and spatial choreography remains clear across the market and attic.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The circus ticket office is vivid (peeling marquee, faded gold letters, dust stratification) and the mainspring barrel's physical presence constrains the final choice—Mira must press the object against the fracture. The ceiling's hairline crack functions as micro-setting that charges the closure image. Sensory hierarchy shifts appropriately: dust patterns dominate in calm observation, then warmth and smell (sawdust, caramel corn) spike during the climactic act. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass orchard on clouds, frost-floor patterns, and silver-pooled chamber are vividly rendered and purposefully symbolic. Spatial choreography is clean; Elias moves from edge to heart without confusion. The frost functions as both sensory anchor and plot mechanism (a map/language), meeting the micro-setting test by constraining his reading of the rupture. However, the setting does not pressure a tactical choice—Elias enacts his plan without environmental resistance—so it charges atmosphere more than agency.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=7.2)
    The baroque asteroid, Obsidian Archive, and temporal storm supply vivid, purposeful atmosphere. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's reverence (chipped vase shard, light fracturing, ceiling arched like ribs). The mirrors function as micro-setting that charges the final image, and the ritual of covering them establishes spatial constraint. Minor slip: the storm's "visible threads of time" remains metaphoric decoration without altering tactics or choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=6.4)
    The resonance chamber hums, vibrates, and trembles throughout, supplying persistent atmosphere. Brass walls, oil smell, scattered tools, and crimson chip anchor the scene tactilely. The chamber's response to the chip ("low thrum that made his teeth ache") charges the environment with purpose. However, spatial choreography remains vague—no map of workbench, doorway, or chamber layout—and the environment does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The chip's presence affects tone but not decision architecture. The final "golden light" bathes the space but does not reweight earlier details with new meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=7.8)
    The subterranean lagoon is vividly rendered—"walls slick with calcite, their surfaces rippling like frozen waves," warm pulsing water—and the limestone cliffs frame the descent. The vial itself functions as micro-setting, recurring in the opening, middle, and closure to constrain and charge the final image. The factory's "resonant hush" pervades spatial perception and the bioluminescent algae wreathing the grandfather grounds the uncanny in tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.7)
    The storm-tossed archway anchors the opening vividly ("clawed the sky into tatters," "waves gnawed at the cliffs"), and the archway's hum returns at closure to charge the final image. The cavern's pulsing walls and the ensemble's layered-era details create texture. However, the "other side" setting remains generic ("the same, yet not—ozone and old books") without constraining Elias's choices or altering his tactics. Spatial choreography is clear, but the environment mostly provides backdrop rather than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=7.1)
    Amber pavilion, cathedral, and autumn/winter transition are vivid and coherent. The stained-glass detail ("hidden layers… tiny, almost invisible night-blooming flowers") is selective and purposeful. The pavilion returns at closure and provides the stage for the final brushstroke, constraining the protagonist's physical act. Sensory detail (scent of damp earth, candlelight casting shapes) reflects POV attention. Spatial choreography remains clear across three locations with clean transitions.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=6.7)
    The zeppelin library and obsidian lagoon are vivid, though the lagoon remains largely atmospheric until the final act. Sensory detail is selective (brass shelves, salt and gun oil, cold water) and filtered through urgency. The beach debris arrangement and the rock-face key crevice show micro-setting shaping action, elevating this above postcard description. However, spatial choreography during the chase (how Elara and Lila navigate from lagoon to zeppelin, distance, obstacles) remains vague, and the pickup trucks' arrival feels staged rather than constrained by geography.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.1)
    The paper-lantern cove is anchored early with sensory specificity (amber light, salty breeze, warped table), and the setting's decay reflects the town's ruin. The lanterns return at closure, shifting from "guttered" to "burned bright," which charges the final image. The bottle's warmth and the silt of the old docks ground the world in tactile detail. However, spatial choreography inside the cove is thin—Elias's body and the table's exact relation are vague—and the transition from interior thought to stepping outside lacks intermediate anchors, briefly floating the action.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.1)
    The orchard atop the Spire is vivid and specific: pomegranate tree, roots through steel beams, hidden aquifers. Spatial choreography is clean (table, tree, fruit falls at his feet). The setting charges the final image—orchard leaves "whispering in a language only the wind understood"—and the juice-stained fingers echo the place. The body (his hands, juice-stained fingers) functions as micro-setting and recurs at closure, meeting the 9+ gate test for constraint or charged final image.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound atrium under starlight is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (frost that "caught the starlight like scattered diamonds," melting ice from "sheer force of unmaking"). The setting constrains Liora's action: only here does the air "hum with possibility" and allow her to attempt the vortex reopening. The micro-setting (acorn cap in hand, hatchling on the floor) charges the final image when the cap warms. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.6)
    The windblown sanctuary, thin sharp air, cold flagstones, and bronze bell create a coherent spatial frame. The rope itself—frayed, copper-wired, pooling beside her—functions as micro-setting that constrains her choice: she mended it herself, it's her tool, and gripping it is the sole mechanism for the siren. The storm's sensory progression (wind howl, rain soft-then-hard, lightning crack) modulates with pressure and the final image charges the ending when she feels the bell's vibrations through the flagstones. Minor limits: the cathedral's interior remains somewhat abstract, and the villagers below are never visualized.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tracking station is vividly rendered with specific details (domed roof, scavenged metal, ozone and parchment scent, control panels, telescopes) that ground the reader. The yellow lantern glass functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's interaction with the star by providing a medium through which he traces its path, and its fractured surface reappears warm in his pocket at closure. The station's "flourishing stillness" subtly mirrors Elias's internal state, and the setting pressures his final shift by offering both isolation and the tools for witness. Sensory detail is purposeful and filtered through spiritual curiosity without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=7.2)
    The beekeeping oasis is vivid and selective: cracked earth, skeletal trees, honeycomb husks, rusted frames anchor desolation and former life. The stained glass box on the warped table and the flower function as micro-setting objects that charge the final image. Sensory detail (humming echo, bleeding sun, crumbling petals) is filtered through Elias's tranquil perception. The wasteland and oasis pressure his solitude choice and the box constrains the closure beat, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment shaping the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=6.7)
    The emerald silo returns at open and close, its "dusty floor" grounding the writing act, and the brass pocket watch's ticking supplies sensory anchor. Garage sales and their poetic tags create a recurring spatial motif that pressures Elias's search. The wildflower field vision contrasts the silo's decay purposefully. Spatial choreography is clean, but the silo itself remains largely atmospheric; it does not constrain a key choice beyond serving as workspace. The rusted key and fragment interaction adds tactile specificity, lifting the score, but the setting stops short of forcing tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lagoon after rain is vividly rendered ("cobalt lagoon lay still after the rain, its surface a sheet of hammered metal") and anchors Mira's emotional journey. The feather, the water at her ankles, and the woven dawns in the reeds all constrain her perception and charge the final image when she begins writing. The setting is filtered through her poet's eye and guides her choice to wade in and later to write. Micro-setting (body, feather, water) functions effectively to deepen stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.6)
    The living stone pillars, moss-slick altar, copper wire, and orchard architecture are vivid and selective. The wire constrains Elias's remodeling method (he loops, tests tension, knows it will oxidize), and the stone pillars' grown surfaces are crucial to the thematic and physical stakes. Sensory detail is filtered through Elias's priorities (the pulse of earth, the wire's glint, the fox's autumn-colored fur). The setting shapes his final act and charges the closure image when the pillars "lean toward one another like old friends."

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rainwashed tower and its open roof charge the final image ("the quiet lets you hear what's always been there"), and the fly amber constrains Elias's choices across beats. Sensory detail is purposeful—moss, wet earth, hawthorn, liquid copper shimmer—and filtered through academic curiosity. The sculpture garden and dusty footprints supply a path that narrows options. Strong micro-setting work; the tower's hollow interior and vials become the crucible that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.1)
    The jetty is grounded through weathered wood, groaning planks, cracks where roots claw, and the transition from twilight bleeding into water. Sensory detail is filtered through Elias's priorities (scent of salt and damp earth, rattling seed pods, the heron's mournful call). The micro-setting—cracks in the jetty where seeds settle—constrains his action and charges the final image when the planks groan softer "as if in reply." Minor reduction for "narrow vastness" tone claim that is asserted more than shown through spatial choreography.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.2)
    The scrapyard and Elias's hollowed transport truck are vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (maps of the dead, rusted oil drum, moonlight on grooves). Sensory selection reflects his professional past and present isolation. The autumn leaf and phonograph cylinder function as charged micro-objects, yet the environment does not meaningfully constrain the final choice—Elias packs and leaves without spatial or resource friction. Strong atmosphere but just shy of the 9-band gate because setting does not alter tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observation deck's time-dilation and star-ribbons are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Elias's perception. The compass heats and spins, charging the final moment. Spatial choreography (glass, railing, pinned sketches) remains clear throughout. The setting constrains Elias's isolation and enables the anomaly's visibility, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, though the deck itself does not force a tactical choice at closure—it remains frame rather than crucible.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.4)
    The icebound spire, wrong sky, and frost-slicked steps ground the reader effectively. The carved chess pieces function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice (she must trade secrets to proceed). The "wrong sky" recurs and charges the final image when it "pulsed like a living thing," directly shaping Lirien's realization. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout the climb and encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=7.4)
    The whispering gallery is vividly rendered with purpose: curved walls catch murmurs, acoustics make her voice sound like someone else's, and the space literally amplifies the theme of echoes and absence. The chessboard on its pedestal and Liora's walking pattern are handled as micro-settings that constrain gesture and meaning. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Liora's reflective stance. The gallery's acoustic properties charge the final collaborative walk, meeting the 9+ gate by constraining the central choice to speak without script and shaping the ending image of voices that outlast them.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mountain-bookstore hybrid is vivid and purposeful: "shelves of books that spiraled upward in impossible geometry" anchors early, and the labyrinth's breathing walls create pressure. The feather's opalescent texture and the stone's hum are used across beats (journal, descent, stone touch), constraining Elias's path. Spatial choreography remains clear through the descent and root chamber. The setting charges the final image (walls shifting, labyrinth rearranging), meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping closure, though the mercury-veins metaphor occasionally drifts into ornamental register.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=7.1)
    Harkensleep is vividly rendered (cobblestones, frost, woven hush, silent villagers) and the platinum labyrinth is a tactile, recurring object that heats and cools in response to Elias's actions. The tapestry's frayed threads and the polished platinum mirror are micro-setting elements that constrain the protagonist's investigative path. Distant thunder functions as atmospheric pressure rather than a direct spatial constraint, but the setting's stillness charges the final exhale. Scope is appropriate for the length; no occupational detail is required and none is forced.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=5.2)
    Cap applied at 7.0 per Orientation Test in Q2. Sensory detail is vivid (mist curling, bone shard pulsing, towers groaning) but largely ornamental—no environmental feature constrains a choice or charges the final image. The pale spire's surface reveal is summary-told rather than explored through action. Spatial choreography is vague: the clearing's relation to the Bone Towers and the spire remains unclear, and Echo's movements are not tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=7.6)
    The acid sea, rusted struts, and grinding gears create a vivid, coherent setting that constrains Elias (platform edge, fumes, tilting workshop). The workshop's mechanical instability pressures his choices and the final steadying charges the closure image. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (metallic air, hissing fumes). The statue's pockmarks function as micro-setting, shaping the central action. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=7.6)
    The coastal caves are richly rendered: phosphorescent algae pulsing like heartbeats, brine and earth-scent, the vast hidden oasis with still water reflecting bioluminescent rock. Spatial choreography is clean (main path fork, downward passage, pool's edge, submerged ledge, dry tunnel). The painted shell constrains Elias's choice to lunge into the water, and the cave's layout guides his discovery of the older paintings. Sensory hierarchy is strong, filtered through a painter's attention to color and light.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.9)
    The cobalt lighthouse, dawn light, storm, and cliffs are vivid and purposeful; the lantern-room glass anchors Elias's sensory attention throughout. The cork's grooves and the phantom garden scent add tactile and olfactory specificity that charges the final beats. Spatial choreography (workbench, window, cliff edge) is coherent. The setting does not directly constrain a choice—Elias's experiment proceeds as planned—but the storm and dawn bracket the stakes and the lighthouse's vibrations echo the core concept, meeting the micro-setting threshold for 7+ without forcing deeper tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.1)
    The signal station's skeletal frame, rusted girders, and cracked concrete establish vivid setting anchored early. The censer's patina, shifting symbols, and weight in Elias's hand recur purposefully and charge the final moment when he walks with it. Sensory detail (salt and rust scent, glass shards crunching) is selective and voice-filtered. The micro-setting (censer as recurring tactile object) constrains his route and shapes the ending, clearing the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=7.6)
    The hanging orchard constrains Mira's choices throughout: its isolation gifts safety, its storm-worn earth hides the eye, and the burial site charges the closure. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through her priorities ("damp loam," "gnarled roots," "branches groaned like a living thing"). The ravine's slick paths and the antique glass eye as tactile object recur with reweighted meaning. Spatial choreography remains clear across all moves, and the final image of Mira standing in the orchard after burial crystallizes setting as both constraint and answer.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal dock, mist, and nautical twilight anchor immediately and filter through Elias's seventeen-year familiarity. The boutonnière functions as micro-setting, its brittle petals "like parchment" returning with "slightly less brittle" texture after mist contact—a small constraint that charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is strong (salt-crusted glass, the "crunch of snow" borrowed memory). The lighthouse beam's recurrent sweep provides spatial rhythm without becoming static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=7.6)
    The shop, the rising creek, and especially the blooming cavern are rendered with vivid, selective detail (bioluminescent blossoms, stone platform, water at ankles). The setting constrains the final choice: the rising water creates urgency, and the door's physical presence forces the chip decision. Spatial choreography remains clear (crack in baseboard → tunnel → platform → door). The creek's rise functions as both atmospheric pressure and a ticking clock, meeting the high-band gate for environment shaping choice.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.1)
    Setting detail is vivid and layered: serpentine trail, ember grotto, cobalt moss "like the underside of a wave," ceiling as "swirling void of stars." The grotto's luminescence and the firefly on her wrist constrain the queen's perception and pace the ascent. Spatial choreography is clear (balcony → path → grotto mouth → interior → mirror). However, the environment does not materially alter a choice; the queen walks through unopposed, and the mirror encounter proceeds without environmental friction. The setting charges atmosphere but does not gate or complicate the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ember nexus is vivid and purposeful: "molten copper," "charred cedar and ozone," embers that "flare" at the climax. The setting constrains choice subtly—Liora crouches on the bridge, the air "hums with forgotten secrets," and the twilight deepens as pressure rises. The nautilus curl as micro-setting object charges the final image when it glows after the vial's drop. Spatial choreography (bridge edge, Elias's approach) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.2)
    The cabin logs, scarred pine table, birch bark scroll, and mountain shadow are vivid and purposeful. The scroll is handled twice (tracing, clutching over fire), and the cabin's walls lined with other scrolls ground the collecting compulsion. The fire-versus-burn moment charges the object with tactical weight. Sensory specificity (iron and pine taste, wind howling) filters through Elias's urgency without postcard lists.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.4)
    The water clock and fogged windows anchor atmosphere early; the screw's worn threads and its tactile cold ground the exchange. The clamp's physical handling (rolling free, turned between fingers, etched) constrains the conversation and charges the closure image. However, the shop itself—gears, brass, clepsydra—remains scenic rather than pressuring choice. Sensory detail is vivid (fog's hush, breath on wrist) but the micro-setting doesn't alter tactics in the peak beat, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating rock tea ceremony platform is vivid and purposefully chosen, grounding the liminal "breath between storms" concept. Sensory details—moss underfoot, ink crystallizing in air, raindrop at close—are selective and charged. The platform's sway and the world "holding its breath" create coherent atmospheric pressure. The quill and inkwell anchor micro-setting that constrains her attempts. Strong enough to reach mid-7s, but the environment doesn't force a tactical shift; it remains primarily backdrop rather than active constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archive's scent of "yellowed paper and old glue," damp stone walls, and stained-glass windows create a vivid micro-setting that supports the elegiac tone. The perfume bottle functions as a micro-setting object that constrains Elias's ritual and charges the final image when it cracks. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's professional and emotional lens (bergamot, lightning, the scratch of a bow). Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Does not quite reach 9+ because the environment does not force a tactical choice, though it does charge the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=6.9)
    The temple library is vivid and purposeful: "shelves stretching into the dim like the ribs of a forgotten god" anchors the setting's metaphoric weight early. The arbitration stone functions as both spatial anchor and symbolic locus. The dictionary as recurring object charges the final image when it vanishes. However, the void in the final third is generic—"threads in the dark"—and does not impose spatial constraint or supply a resource that alters Elara's weaving. The environment guides mood but does not tighten her choices.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=7.6)
    The station's physical particulars—iron girders, gas lamp, hydraulic pipes, master clock's pendulum—constrain Elias's troubleshooting moves and charge the final image. The horizon itself functions as both setting anchor and object of measurement, wavering "like heat off a stove" and snapping back after the blood drop. Sensory hierarchy is consistent: professional shepherd notices gears, pipes, pendulum hesitation. The micro-setting (workbench, clock face, razor edges) narrows spatial focus and enables the climactic thumb-press. Fjord quiet bookends the piece, modulating from oppressive to "deeper than before."

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.2)
    The rainwashed library, mica-pane lanterns, and basement archives are vivid and purposeful. The lantern is handled twice (lit, then flame applied to mica pane) and its light transformation drives the climactic revelation. Sensory detail is selective ("mildew and old ambition," "fractured light through translucent windows") and filtered through Elara's investigative focus. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (entrance → reference desk → basement).

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=7.4)
    The utility tunnel, booth, and glass disc are vivid and specific; the disc's spirals "seemed to move when she wasn't looking" and the "hum of streetlamps" frame time effectively. The disc constrains Mara's attempts to play it and charges the closure image when she presses it to her ear. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Mara's familiarity. Minor: the flooded maintenance shaft origin feels ornamental rather than constraint-bearing.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.2)
    The jetty is vividly rendered—weathered planks, warm wood, sea lavender, twilight glow—and the locket functions as micro-setting, handled twice and charging the final image. The gull's arrival and the water's glow add sensory specificity. Spatial choreography is clean. The setting does not, however, constrain a choice or supply a tactical resource; it primarily serves as atmosphere and symbolic backdrop, keeping the score below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.2)
    The disused station is vividly rendered with concrete sensory anchors (damp stone, ivy waterfalls, cracked platform, moss between tracks) and the setting's decay mirrors Elias's isolation. The moon rock's jagged edge and faint hum supply tactile and perceptual detail that charges Elias's longing. However, the station does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—Elias arrives, waits, and the logistician appears on cue; the ivy and pigeons enrich atmosphere but do not pressure the outcome, keeping the setting in the strong-but-not-essential band.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ultrasonic forest is vividly realized through synesthetic detail: "leaves trembling like strings of an untuned violin," "air hummed at a frequency just below pain," bark "smooth as glass." Sensory hierarchy reflects Liora's blindness and haptic focus. The platinum compass ring recurs and its warming/cooling guides navigation, constraining her path and charging the final inward-pointing moment. The clearing and the stillpoint tree shape the climax, providing the spatial anchor for her transformation. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gravitational anomaly and dried fountain are vivid and purposeful, filtering through Liora's attention (the nib's shifting symbols, the ozone-and-bread smell). The plaza and fountain anchor spatial choreography cleanly. However, neither the anomaly nor the environment constrains a choice or charges the final image—they remain atmospheric rather than tactical. The pen is handled twice but does not alter an on-page decision, capping the score below 7.5 under the micro-setting test.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.1)
    The harbor's luminous moonlight and salt-wind texture the atmosphere purposefully, but setting functions mostly as backdrop rather than constraint. The vintage camera is handled in multiple beats (traced, lifted, pointed) and the no-film detail sharpens meaning—capture vs. feeling. Spatial choreography (dock edge, horizon) tracks cleanly. The harbor's role as refuge during grief primes the closure but doesn't alter present tactics; it charges the final image without forcing a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.7)
    The archive's "scorched parchment and old secrets" and the defaced portraits create atmospheric specificity, and the tapestry fragment functions as micro-setting by constraining Elara's choice to help. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (bookshelf, pillar, far wall), though the mural's sudden visibility ("she hadn't noticed until now") strains credibility. The setting pressures the revelation but does not force a trade-off; the environment enables rather than complicates. The final image (archway lock turning) charges setting detail with thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sound wave garden and auric lagoon are vivid and purposeful: the garden's resonant metal sculptures guide Elias's final drumming, and the lagoon anchors both past and present stakes. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through urgency ("ozone and old paper, like the sound wave garden after rain"). The lab setting is more generic—"cold metal table," "sterile glow of monitors"—and spatial choreography during the escape (halls to garden to lagoon) is sketched rather than grounded. The garden sculptures constrain the climactic action, lifting the score, but the lagoon functions more as atmospheric backdrop than active pressure on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shipping-container labyrinth is vivid and specific: frost, sodium halos, the smell of salt and old paper in 19-X, the humming metal under geomagnetic current. The storm constrains movement and charges the atmosphere. The woman's spiral walk and Elias's precise pacing show micro-setting shaping tactics. The labyrinth functions as more than backdrop—it pressures the search and supplies the recurring containers as both anchors and plot nodes.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt dock, rain-slicked planks, bruised sky, and canal lapping establish vivid sensory grounding anchored early. The dental mirror and shutters function as micro-setting tools that constrain Maris's demonstration choices—she angles the mirror to show the girl's gap-toothed reflection, manipulates shutter-slats to fracture light—altering the encounter's tactics. The mica-flecked pebble charges the final exchange when its glow persists after darkness falls, and the canal's metronome sound subtly mirrors Maris's weaving rhythm. Sensory selection is filtered through Maris's silent, patient attention, and the environment evolves causally as daylight dims.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt library, mist, stained glass, and gas lamps anchor setting vividly and the sensory detail (cool marble queen, cold glass, dust on books) is purposeful. However, the environment remains scenic rather than constraining—Elias's final choice to walk outside is not shaped by spatial access or resource scarcity. The magnetic grotto is referenced but never shown, and the synchronized window displays are described but not used as a physical constraint or enabling tool in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=7.1)
    Port Veyra's docks are vivid and embodied: "slick with the last rain," ropes "no thicker than her wrists," bare feet on damp wood. The sublittoral fringe and the island's black sand, twisted trees, and coral temple supply atmospheric specificity. The scrimshaw's tactile warmth and the whale's resonant call function as micro-setting elements that guide Lirien's journey, though the island itself remains more symbolic than spatially coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The farmhouse, turbines, dried flowers, and whittled stick anchor setting with purposeful constraint. The turbines' groaning becomes a recurring sonic motif that pressures silence. The bouquet and carved bird function as micro-setting objects; he places the bird "beside the bouquet, another offering to the silence," which charges that pairing. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered ("tea burned his tongue, but he drank it anyway").

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt atrium, quartz colonnade, and frozen lake are vividly rendered with sensory specificity ("veined with light like captured auroras," "light pooled like liquid cobalt"). Setting details recur and evolve: the ice cracks, the hum softens, the light dims, all reflecting the protagonist's progression. The quartz's vibration serves as both tactile anchor and metaphorical constraint on her perceptual frame. While the environment charges the final image, it does not materially constrain a choice or force a trade-off, keeping it just below the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.6)
    The courtyard functions as more than postcard: molten silica scent, jasmine trellis, spiral of potted plants, and the kiln-warm glass shard all return and constrain or enable Elias's choices. The glassblowing details (helix of gold and crimson, phoenix color) charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory selection (touch, scent, light-on-glass) reflects Elias's professional bias.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.1)
    The laboratory setting is richly textured (glass jars of sounds, prism-song bells, golden shadows, high windows) and the miner's carbide lamp lens returns with charged meaning at the climax, vibrating and glowing to signal connection. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through Elias's tactile, sound-focused perception. The lens and bells function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=7.1)
    The observatory's brass gears, velvet curtains, and telescope create a concrete micro-setting that constrains Elias's movements and charges the final image—he must climb the spiral staircase and look through the eyepiece to access the constellation revelation. The botanical garden's skeletal frames and hand-painted rosebush, the library where books whisper, and the clockmaker's shop with turning gears all filter through Elias's mourning lens and guide his trajectory toward the observatory dome. Spatial choreography across multiple locations remains clear, and sensory detail (dust motes, lavender scent, slanted light) stays selective and purposeful. The setting directly enables the closure choice by providing the telescope and starlight that deliver Liora's message.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.1)
    The loft's rain-beaded skylight and workbench are vividly rendered, and sensory details (ink bleeding, static-glowing lantern, rain rhythm) are filtered through Lira's professional lens. The measuring tape as micro-setting object returns with shifted meaning at closure ("measuring what's left"), charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean, and the environment subtly mirrors her work of tracing gaps and sedimentary records.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive is vividly rendered with obsidian walls, bioluminescent moss, and the bronze prism pagoda; spatial choreography is clean. The pagoda's light-refracting properties constrain Elara's approach and charge the closure image when walls dissolve into light. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elara's historian lens, elevating the setting above postcard description into a presence that shapes the final reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=7.2)
    The blooming library with silver vines and self-turning pages establishes a vivid, fantastical micro-setting that constrains Elias's work to this sanctuary. The river stone returns as a tactile anchor (windowsill, palm, floor) and its warming signals the theory's validation. Spatial choreography is clear: Elias at the terminal, shadow on floor and ankle, stone on sill then floor. The setting does not materially constrain a choice—Elias could merge footage anywhere—so it charges atmosphere more than tactics, capping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.4)
    The workshop is vividly anchored: mist, oil lamp, jars of specimens, glass roof, stars. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"scent of damp earth and pine," "shimmering stillness," shadows across wooden floor. The environment constrains Elias's choice: he reaches for adhesive, then switches to tweezers, using the tools at hand to enact his shift from repair to acceptance. The chameleon's enclosure and the workbench function as micro-settings that shape his final actions. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout; the workshop reads as sanctuary and crucible simultaneously.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tower, garden, tunnel, and chamber are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (frosted sand, greenish glow, damp earth). The hourglass functions as a charged object across multiple beats (found, turned, cracks, sand doesn't fall) and the coffee cup's concentric rings supply the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the descent. The setting constrains movement (tunnel slope, darkness, moss on walls) and the chamber's hourglass-lined walls charge the final moment, meeting the 9+ gate for environment shaping the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.2)
    The projection booth is vividly rendered with concrete sensory anchors: celluloid/dust scent, dormant gears "like a heart in hibernation," film perforations traced by hand. The setting constrains Mira's method (psychometry requires the booth's "liminal pocket") and provides the projector that activates at closure, charging the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The micro-setting (film strip on lap, booth humming) functions as both tool and environment, meeting the 9+ gate test by shaping the closure beat when light spills through the film.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=5.1)
    The aurora archway is vivid in color ("emerald and violet," "gold and crimson") and frames the scene, but spatial choreography blurs: Liora stands, kneels, reaches upward, yet her relation to ground and sky remains abstract. The brass instrument is held, raised, lowered, then "lay beside her" with no tactile interaction that constrains a choice. Sensory detail skews visual-only; cold air and earth are mentioned but never shape her tactics. The archway returns in the final image as passive backdrop, not a feature that alters outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=6.4)
    The glowing dune and archive shelves are vivid and filtered through Elias's discovery. The clock's cold glass and ozone/old-paper scent ground key beats. However, the archive itself—infinite shelves, child's shoe, broken watch—reads as atmospheric catalog without constraining a choice or altering tactics. The dune's "bloom" petals and humming sand anchor the opening but do not return to charge the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.8)
    The mechanical rainforest is vividly rendered—copper leaves, groaning gears, rusted soil—and the sensory detail is purposeful. The small gear constrains the philosopher's perception (sharpens the hum, pulls him to the clearing) and charges the translocation beat. However, the final hybrid setting ("neither metal nor wood") dissolves into abstraction without further spatial constraint on the closing choice. The gear's role elevates the score, but the ending setting does not pressure the philosopher's final step.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Veiled Ridgeway, reeds, cove lanterns, and wet sand ground spatial choreography cleanly. The ticket punch recurs with evolving charge (worn edges, glowing faintly, pressed against air). Sensory detail is selective and voice-filtered ("damp earth and salt," "boots sinking"). The star stamp's glow at closure charges the final image, lifting the category into mid-7s despite minimal occupational depth for the ferryman role.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt fortress, snow, parchment-and-rust air, and dusty spiral staircase anchor place and tone effectively. The missing bolt and the sheet music function as micro-setting objects that constrain investigation. The practice room's transformation (piano replaced by chair and stand) charges the final confrontation. Snow muffles outside sound while fortress silence "presses against his ears," supporting both POV filter and thematic pressure. The staircase discoloration guides Elias's route and shapes his choices across multiple beats, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.6)
    The temple library is vividly rendered—sagging arches, cracked glass, warped shelves—and the loose stone mechanism delivers a concrete constraint that enables the scroll's discovery. The iron gall ink pellet and the scroll's singed edges anchor tactile detail. Spatial choreography is clean (shelf, hollow, scroll handling). The setting pressures Liora's search and the "regally unpretentious ruin" tag modulates tone without forcing micro-setting choices at peak beats, keeping the category shy of 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sea-level monitoring station supplies recurring sensory anchors (humming machinery, salt scent, tide gauge blinks) and the lowest-level floor panel constrains Elara's search spatially. The setting actively pressures her investigation by its archive gaps and isolation. The micro-setting of the loose panel and the atlas pages charges the final discovery, meeting the 9+ gate requirement for constraint or closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=7.2)
    The spaceport bay, stone circle, and opera glasses all appear and constrain action: barefoot on cracked concrete, ozone-and-wildflower air, symbols that shift when blinked. The body (barefoot, palm) and the glasses function as micro-setting, anchoring POV and charging the final touch. The "margin of daylight" and "dying light pooled in corners" tie atmosphere to the timeframe and support the tone. The stone circle's hum directly shapes Lira's approach and the climactic touch, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=7.1)
    The volcanic springs supply sulfur scent, obsidian cracks, and mineral water that Mira traces and kneels beside, grounding her physically. The springs tremble during the unsealing, constraining the action spatially. The kite snagged on a dead pine and the amber-embedded embryo charge the closure image with recurring specificity. Micro-setting (obsidian, steam, mineral slickness) successfully replaces broad geography at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=7.9)
    The arboretum's clifftop perch and glass terrarium constrain choices—wind, salt fog, vibrations from drones press on the orchid and Lena's attention. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: chlorophyll-stained hands, bone meal sack, sea crash. The orchid in the terrarium functions as micro-setting, charging the climax when its sway anchors Lena's pulse. Spatial choreography remains clear across potting shed, terrarium, and bench. One small slip: the ledger's "new entry" risks spatial vagueness (who wrote it?) but does not break the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lighthouse library constrains choice: the physical claustrophobia (walls pressing closer) mirrors and intensifies Elias's psychological unraveling, forcing the redesign sequence. Sensory specificity is strong—"scent of salt and old parchment," "shelves sagging under the weight of books...their spines cracked like old bones." The broken tarot box and scattered cards function as micro-setting elements that anchor the redesign action. The spatial evolution (library shrinking to coffin-size, then expanding) directly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.2)
    The wind-carved encampment and eclipse aftermath provide sensory texture—dust, faded canvas, scent of distant rain—filtered through Elias's tracker perception. Spatial choreography of the outcrop, tents, and center clearing remains clear. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; it functions as evocative backdrop. The ink pooling and rising is vividly rendered but operates more as spectacle than environment pressing tactics, keeping the score in the mid-6 band.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=7.4)
    The library's cryogenic chambers, the Mirror of Echoes, and snow-muffled silence create a coherent atmosphere. The Mirror constrains discovery—he sees Seraphine's vision—and the final chamber setting charges the act of leaving the letter. Spatial choreography is clear: shelves, Mirror, chamber entrance, pedestal. The snowbound quiet subtly mirrors the enforced stillness theme and recurs in the ending, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glass dome and twin suns anchor early; sensory detail (warm soil, velvety petals, humid warmth) is vivid and filtered through Liora's perceptive bias. The dome itself constrains the final beat—sealing them in, wind outside versus stillness inside—charging the closure image with spatial pressure. The sandbag scrap and irrigation line ground micro-setting. Minor slip: "tranquil blazes" in the opener feels ornamental rather than perception-driven. Spatial choreography (father at entrance, Liora kneeling, door hissing shut) is clean.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sound wave garden is vividly rendered with specific, POV-filtered detail: "silver reeds bending in the wind like the ribs of a sleeping giant." The setting constrains Kael's movement ("The reeds parted before him") and the garden's dissonance actively guides his zigzag path. The rail spike's physical weight is tracked ("its weight familiar against his thigh"), and the black sand shore anchors spatial choreography throughout. Strong sensory hierarchy and the garden's shift from harmony to chaos charges the final stillness, though the constellations' mechanics remain atmospheric rather than spatially grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=6.2)
    The observatory is vivid (dome "swallowing" sunset, brass eyepiece, gaslight) and returns at closure (balcony, wind, lights below), charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear across beats. However, the setting doesn't constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics—Elara could write the letters anywhere. The nib functions as micro-setting (tool-as-anchor) and does charge closure, lifting the score above mid-band. Capped at 7.0 due to orientation debt applied in Q2.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=7.1)
    The laboratory is vivid and purposeful: rusted phonographs, glass jars humming with melodies, and the amber on the workbench anchor the space with sensory specificity. The amber's tactile shift (warm → cold) tracks causally and charges the ending. Micro-setting works well—the tattoo gun and the firmware screens constrain Elias's choices and recur with evolving significance. The "perpetual chill" and "meteor hush" settle the tone consistently. Minor slip: spatial choreography is thin (where is the translator relative to the workbench? how does he move between devices?), and the mosquito's wings "seem to flutter" at the end risks convenient animation rather than earned perception.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=7.6)
    The whispering grotto is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail: lilac mist, humming tiles, floating flakes, sand mandala. Spatial choreography is clear (grotto mouth, mandala on sand, Liora kneeling/leaning). The setting constrains choice: the mandala's self-rearranging lines force Liora to reinterpret her method, and the tile flake becomes a tactile pivot. The final image—glowing lines—charges the ending by making the grotto's "emergent hush" visible. Micro-setting (sand, chalk, tile) functions as pressure and participates in closure, meeting the 9+ gate for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=7.4)
    The plaza, shattered sky, mosaic tesserae, and stepping stone are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Liora's retrocognitive lens. The stepping stone constrains her choice by revealing *Amira*'s name and the negative space, making it causally active. The lantern, lapis edge ("sharp enough to draw blood"), and the chipped patterns all charge the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful and layered, meeting the 9+ constraint test.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=7.2)
    The orchard setting is richly textured with seasonal overlaps and scent ("ripe apples and something older"), and the hedge maze theater edge is spatially coherent. Micro-setting details—damp grass, the coin pressed into earth—ground the magic ritual. The environment constrains the action (waiting for tourists to leave, the secrecy of the space) and the coin's placement in soil charges the climax, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography of the echoes and Liora's movement is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.4)
    The studio's blacklight, phosphorescent paint, and ozone scent create a vivid micro-setting that enables Mara's mapping action. The muscovite geode as recurring object constrains her interpretation (fractals = pathways). Spatial choreography is clean (wall, corner where Eli watches, air where she paints). The environment directly charges the final image: painting in air becomes possible only under blacklight in this specific space, and the glowing pathways "remained" as embodied proof.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.4)
    The coastal cave network is vividly rendered with bioluminescent glow, calcite fractures, and salt air; the setting pressures Eira's choices by changing (pulsing walls, fissure opening) and the heat-mapping device reads the cave's response. The elm leaf fossil functions as micro-setting, constraining her final choice (it burns, pulses with light) and charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the environment is tactile and purposeful rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=7.6)
    The amber warehouse is vividly rendered (wooden beams groaning, single window casting amber light) and the highest shelf, workbench, and hourglass corner provide clear spatial anchors. The canyon echo jar on the highest shelf recurs meaningfully and the warehouse's "underside of the cliffs" location evokes secrecy and weight. The buttons' tactile variety (brass crown, mother-of-pearl chip, dull plastic) and the warehouse's amber glow charge the final reversal, satisfying the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=7.1)
    Zephyr Bluff and the hidden door constrain Elias's final choice: he must physically descend and use the key, grounding the symbolic in spatial action. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful (mist "curled like smoke," zephyr "sharp with the promise of spring"), filtered through Elias's survivor lens. The codes in snow and the door half-buried in ivy charge the setting with history and consequence. However, the interior room (dust, maps, ledgers) remains under-developed; it does not alter tactics or impose friction, reading more as a symbolic terminus than a lived space. The body (scar, breath) and the pillbox function as micro-setting elements that recur and reweight at closure, lifting the score within the band.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.2)
    The fog-bound river crossing is vivid and consistent; sensory detail—slick rope, ticking gutters, spindrift—is well-chosen and filtered through Elias's occupational familiarity. The ferry itself functions as micro-setting, with the fraying rope constraining one on-page action (the stitching). Spatial choreography is clean, and the storm's progression affects Elias's task. The final image of the other bank emerging "like a revelation" charges the setting slightly, though it does not force a tactical choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.8)
    The oasis is vividly particular: "skeletal orchard of withered lavender," "hollow husks of hives," wax melted into sand. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Ren's craft attention (clay mimicking land dips, light catching cracks like veins). The lantern glass functions as micro-setting object, thrumming and shifting to cue temporal instability. Setting pressures the ending: thicker air at the oldest hive and smoke flattening signal the climax. The rusted brazier, bleached wood, and blooming-out-of-season lavender all anchor the time-fold logic. No placeholder generics; every detail supports the fractured-timeline premise.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fire escape, rusted railings, and harbor provide consistent spatial grounding; the rosebush's final petal triggers the timeframe and the bitting gauge functions as micro-setting (a tool that constrains Elias's gesture). The lantern's pooling light and the harbor's "liquid silver" surface are vivid and purposeful. However, the "crumbling apartment building" and "forgotten corner of the city" remain generic backdrops; specificity would elevate. The moonlit harbor charges the final image but does not constrain a choice directly, keeping it mid-high rather than essential.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tidal library's shelves that "rise and fall with the rhythm of the tides" and the stone circle's vibration provide vivid sensory anchors. The sundial's shadow pointing to specific books constrains Lira's search and charges the ending when "the shelves rearranged, the books drifting toward her." Spatial choreography is clear, and the library's responsiveness subtly mirrors her internal shift, elevating setting beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lotus temple and lily pond anchor space; the installation of suspended mirrors provides a second locale. Sensory detail is present but leans heavily on visual metaphor ("voice the color of wet stone") without tactile grounding. The temple's petals and pond mist recur but do not constrain a choice—Mira moves freely between locations without spatial friction. The twig is handled across beats, qualifying as micro-setting, but its physical properties (smooth bark, spiral shape) do not alter her tactics or the final image's charge in a material way.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.1)
    The radio station setting is anchored early (observation booth, dials, broadcast tower) and the subsonic generator is a functional tool that Mara handles across beats. Sensory detail—static hum, fogging breath, red warning lights—supports atmosphere but remains somewhat generic. The charts constrain her diagnosis and the generator enables the solution, meeting the micro-setting standard for 600–800 words. However, the campus quad and tower exterior are described rather than used to pressure choices, and no spatial choreography shifts under stress.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.2)
    The fractured dome, damp stone, old parchment, and scaffolding ground the opening. The compass (brass-tipped, needle sharp) and the drafting table anchor tactile detail. The central chamber's "air shimmering, warping like heat" and the figure's glowing ink-trails provide sensory specificity that reflects POV urgency. The starlight-veins motif recurs and charges the final image ("The stars above weren't just light. They were a map"), satisfying the micro-setting gate for 9+ eligibility, though spatial choreography during the organ-music approach could be sharper.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=7.2)
    The quarry's mist and jagged walls establish atmosphere effectively, and the ribbon fragment is handled twice (discovery, then traced while the figure speaks). Sensory detail is selective and mood-consistent. However, the setting does not constrain a choice or supply a resource that alters tactics; it remains a backdrop. The lance buried "under the rocks where the police never looked" gestures toward environmental pressure but is told, not shown as a spatial or tactical obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cliffside station is vividly anchored with rusted girders, salt-warped shelves, mildew/ozone scent, and the failing generators. The copper nail functions as micro-setting: it constrains Mira's search and unlocks the hidden passage, directly enabling the closure revelation. Spatial choreography (archives → furnace → passage) is clear. The "new sky" and shifted jet stream add atmospheric pressure without becoming a postcard. The nail's flattened head and the furnace lock are specific, purpose-driven details that charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=7.2)
    The mountain pullout is vividly rendered with rusted guardrail lace, wet stone scent, and rain drumming. The fiddle functions as both tool and perceptual anchor, shaping Lena's engagement with the scene. The pixelated valley image is memorable and ties to theme, though it remains descriptive rather than constraining a choice. Spatial choreography is clean, and sensory selection reflects Lena's priorities without becoming a catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The circus train is rendered with vivid, purposeful specificity: broken unicycle, moth-eaten whip, carved initials, and the scent of sawdust anchor the ruin concretely. The foreign bills—yen, euros, pesos—supply tactile and visual detail that Elias handles across multiple beats. The train's creaking and the fox's golden eyes charge the dusky atmosphere. The micro-setting (train car floor, encroaching vines, rain) constrains Elias's reflective stance and charges the final departure, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=6.9)
    The observatory dome, brass eyepiece, and telegram are rendered with specificity and recurring sensory detail (groaning iron, fogged glass, brittle petals). The telegram object constrains a choice by prompting Elias's reflection, and the observatory setting frames the entire action. However, the environment does not evolve or pressure tactics during the climactic realization; it remains atmospheric backdrop. The daylily metaphor is vivid but functions more as thematic ornament than a spatial or tactile constraint on the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cursed lake and vortex anchor the scene with frost-rimed mud, glistening fruit "like wet teeth," and cracking ice. The seed and its tendrils function as micro-setting that constrains Veyra's choice (she cannot pull away once latched). The polished-bone mirror charges the final image by showing the child with knife in hand. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (cold biting through gloves, tendril warmth despite frost), filtered through Veyra's druidic attention. Spatial choreography is clear: shore → kneeling at vortex center → lake thawing beneath. The swirling orchard remains more atmospheric than a tool that shapes tactics, keeping this in mid-7s rather than higher.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=6.7)
    The cobalt glade is vividly rendered ("bruise deepening in the dusk") and the maze topiary's labyrinthine structure anchors the setting concretely. However, the setting doesn't constrain choice—Elias walks forward without spatial or social friction, and the glade's dissolution into the star-strewn plain feels decorative rather than causally motivated. Micro-setting elements (the clipping, the scar, the oldest tree) are present but don't alter tactics at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=7.6)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail (wet earth, old rot, roots threading through bones) that grounds the setting's macabre texture. The environment directly constrains Liora's ritual choices and charges the final image when "the roots trembled, as if remembering something long forgotten." Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (crouching between trunks, stranger stepping into dim glow). The half-lit atmosphere modulates appropriately, narrowing perception during the bargain scene while admitting broader detail in calmer beats.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.2)
    The quarry office, diesel smell, and the pit's "open wound" imagery ground the setting concretely. The pickaxe and speaker grille cloth function as micro-setting elements that constrain Jake's appraisal work and charge the final image at the pit's edge. Sensory detail (wind moan, gravel crunch, muddy prints) is selective and voice-filtered. The quarry's acoustic properties (echoes, singing) tie directly to Jake's former occupation and the thematic concern with sound and loss, making the setting essential to the closure moment.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=7.6)
    The metallic arbor above the clouds is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (pulsing alloy, glowing cuneiform, churning clouds below), and the body (Elara's palm pressed to bark, warmth of the seed) functions as micro-setting that constrains her final choice. The seed's insertion into the fissure—where cuneiform is deepest—demonstrates setting guiding action. Spatial choreography remains coherent (branches, trunk, clouds, her kneeling position). The environment charges the final image when the arbor shivers and lifts "as if in relief," directly participating in closure.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=7.2)
    The tidal atrium is vivid and integrated: salt-laced air, milky glass dome, water lapping brass toes. The creel appears early, is handled across multiple beats, and charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clear (desk, shelves, water's edge). The setting supplies resources (books, water, tide) that enable the closure action, meeting the 9+ gate requirement of constraining choice or charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.8)
    Crystal caves frame and constrain: shattered quartz, prismatic whispers, latent radiance all recur and charge the final image when "the crystal caves shimmered, their edges softer now." The pearl interacts with the cave's radiance to amplify effect, and the bunker's metal walls hold the confessions that drive the arc. Spatial choreography is clear (entry, bunker interior, shelf, exit). The caves' textural shift at the end—quartz "no longer felt like shards, but like seeds"—directly charges the closure image and reflects the inspector's internal reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ivy-choked station is vividly rendered with sensory detail (rusted turnstiles, peeling schedule boards, broken windows) and the bathroom graffiti functions as both atmosphere and thematic device. The accordion's patched bellows and the river's "low, relentless hum" are purposefully repeated. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The setting constrains Lena's search for wisdom to this archive of "lost souls," and the final ivy rustle "as if the station itself was whispering" charges the ending image, though the constraint on choice remains oblique.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glowing library supplies vivid sensory texture (mist, pulsing spines, electric scent), and the watch functions as a micro-setting object handled twice with shifting meaning. However, the library never constrains a choice or alters tactics—the protagonist moves through it as a passive observer, and spatial choreography remains unclear (aisles appear and vanish without consequence). The cyclically reversed symbol and propagation delays remain decorative rather than functional anchors that guide action.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.1)
    The velvet-draped dome, cold gloves, transparent violin, and overlapping coffee stains are vivid and purposeful. The plants lean toward Elara and later surge forward to bind her father—micro-setting that constrains the climactic choice. Spatial choreography is clean (door, table, corner plants, windows shattering), and sensory detail (breath fogging, cracking-ice note) anchors each beat. Reaches low-7 band on environment-as-constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto, aurora, and ice provide vivid sensory anchors that recur and modulate through the piece. The emerald chip's glow is filtered through Liora's professional attention. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric; no spatial constraint or environmental feature forces a tactical choice or alters the outcome. The final aurora flare charges the closure image but does not constrain agency, keeping the score below 8.0.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=7.2)
    The grotto is vividly rendered ("jagged walls slick with condensation," "bioluminescent fungi") and spatially coherent (ledge, yew tree, descent, pool). The hairpin functions as micro-setting, constraining Mira's choice to press it into water and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven (scent of damp earth, water rippling). The vineyards below provide atmospheric framing but do not alter tactics. Environment pressures the protagonist through the descent and the pool encounter, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.1)
    The lighthouse, wind chimes, and campfire embers anchor locale and atmosphere; the chimes' "discordant song" and the cloak's suffocating presence filter through Elias's skeptical attention. The mirror shard's warmth and the chimes' urgent clatter pressure Elias's final choice to ask the key question, satisfying the constraint test. Spatial choreography is clear (circular base, rafters, outside embers). Minor deduction: the "breezy" dawn and salt-scent are vivid but not irreplaceable; a static lighthouse could serve the same plot with modest rewrites.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating platform, magnetic grotto, and pond rings are vividly rendered and purpose-driven. The platform's "cool, smooth surface, worn by centuries" and the grotto's lodestone glow create atmospheric specificity. The rings constrain Elara's reading of time and charge the climax when they freeze. Spatial choreography (kneeling, dipping fingers, standing) remains clear, and the sycamore leaves bookend the piece with tonal coherence, satisfying the micro-setting standard for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=7.2)
    The canyon, towers of bone, and harmonic stone skimmer are vividly rendered with concrete sensory detail—"hummed with the weight of centuries," "dust rising around his boots like a ghost's sigh." The skimmer's vibration guides Elias forward, constraining his path, and the arrowhead unlocks the door, both objects pressuring choice. Spatial choreography is clear. The setting charges the final image, qualifying for mid-7s.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.6)
    The icebound spire, garden folly, black-glass courtyard, and fountain of liquid light anchor spatial progression and constrain Elias's path (he must climb, touch the keystone, dissolve in mist). The recurring "lingering luminance" charges the final flower image, and the micro-setting—his translucent hands, the mist clinging alive—shapes his perception of transformation. Sensory detail is vivid and selective (breath fogging, frost-cracked stone, wind through dead leaves). The spire's presence bookends the piece, approving the flower's pulse, which elevates the setting's role in the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.1)
    The pier, harbor, and SS Marigold are anchored with vivid, purpose-driven detail: algae-slick ladder rungs, warped shelves, moonlight through a porthole. The library's airtight survival and the open book on the reading desk both guide Elias's choices and charge the final sky-lantern tableau. Sensory selection (salt, old paper, liquid-gold glow) reflects the POV's professional lamplighter attention to light and decay. The lantern release operates as both timeframe and micro-setting, constraining the window and supplying the visual proof of "color of sound." Minor slip: the woman's silhouette "framed by the dim light" in the dark library interior reads spatially unclear after the single moonbeam setup.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=6.9)
    The ambered observatory deck with "warped floorboards" and glass that traps starlight provides a vivid frame, and the coins function as micro-setting objects that Elias handles across multiple beats. The setting constrains his ritual (scattering lots on the deck) and the fogged glass anchors his exhalation at a key turn. Spatial choreography is clear (standing at edge, placing coins on deck, closing fist). The cosmic backdrop (contracting universe, flickering stars) charges atmosphere but remains largely decorative; it doesn't materially alter his final choice beyond metaphorical resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.7)
    The observatory is anchored with selective detail (groaning dome, brass lectern, dust-choked floor, lenses as prisms) that coheres spatially. The atlas page and scattered light constrain the climactic action: Elias uses the light pooling in his palm and the ink rising to meet his touch. The environment charges the final image (beam lancing into sky), meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Sensory hierarchy is present (sight dominates, touch secondary) and the dusk progression supports tone, though some metaphors (sea monsters "whispering of depths") drift into ornamental register.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sapphire viaduct is vividly rendered with specific sensory detail (blue glass, humming arches, water leaks). The viaduct's dripping water constrains Elias's repair method—too fast or slow spoils the bronze—thus shaping the central action. Dawn light charges the opening and final image. The bell's jagged bronze edge and the river below provide micro-setting that alters tactics and closure participation.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=7.2)
    The midnight ridgeway, reservoir, and distillery interior are vivid and purposeful. Sensory detail is selective: "damp wood and something sweeter—the ghost of fermented berries" filters through Elias's warden expertise. The distillery's stone walls and the lantern's flicker constrain the discovery scene, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean across three micro-locations. The 9+ test is narrowly missed: the setting supplies atmosphere and frames discovery but does not force a tactical choice with visible cost at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.7)
    The kaleidoscopic waterfall and hidden orchard are vividly rendered with sensory specificity (prismatic veil, damp earth, scent of apples, hum of bees). The frozen dew crystal at the tree's center constrains Liora's final gesture (kneeling, pressing it into earth), charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. Micro-setting (the crystal, the tree) functions purposefully, lifting the score, though the broader orchard remains more atmospheric than tactically binding.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=7.1)
    The arbor is concretely rendered—blackened branches, leaves whispering, grooves in bark, vine testing—and constrains choice (harness knotting, branch groaning, snap forcing the catch). The buckle as micro-setting object matters: threaded through vine teeth, it anchors him at the snap. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency (wind rattling, branch groaning at peak). The city below functions as distant stake marker but does not pressure present moves. Spatial choreography is clean across the climb. No occupational depth is required here; the arbor's physics govern tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating dojo, weathered platform grooves, ozone-and-incense air, and churning clouds anchor setting vividly. The brain jar recurs with thematic weight, and the sword exchanges show clear spatial choreography. The dojo's trembling ("the earth itself had noticed") adds atmosphere but doesn't materially constrain Kael's final choice. Micro-setting (practice sword weight, slick palms) supports embodiment throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=7.1)
    The echo chamber tunnel functions as micro-setting, shaping the sound that Elias conducts and providing spatial choreography (mouth of the tunnel, far end, curved walls). The leaf blower's mechanics and the pull cord's frayed state ground the tool in tactile detail. The tunnel's acoustics constrain his method and charge the final image when laughter "fills the space like a symphony." Sensory hierarchy favors sound over other senses, which fits the concept but leaves some visual and tactile opportunities unexplored.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=7.2)
    The frozen garden, skeletal trees, and mist are vivid and filter consistently through Mara's longing. The pendant's cold weight recurs and the book's blank-to-inscribed transformation constrains the final beat. Spatial choreography remains coherent (hedges, clearing, frost underfoot), and the "damp earth and old parchment" scent anchors early. The setting pressures Mara's stance and charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.1)
    The ember nexus is vivid ("crimson glow," "violet sky like ink in water") and the workshop's cracked stone floor and scattered glass anchor spatial choreography. The broken crozier's physical jaggedness charges the final beat. Micro-setting qualifies: the crozier and crucible constrain Elias's actions and appear at closure. Sensory detail is purposeful but occasionally drifts toward decorative (the "frozen bloom" of flames feels poeticized without tactical pressure).

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.1)
    The suspended tower city and lunar perigee supply vivid, purposeful atmosphere. The tower's highest platform, groaning girders, and the gorge below create spatial pressure that culminates in the tower's fall. The Hollywood star fragment functions as a tool that constrains Mira's approach (she presses it to the input port, triggering the device's transformation). The perigee's pull operates as both setting and timeframe, warping signals and intensifying at the peak moment, directly charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=7.2)
    The spectral grotto, stars forming "interconnected patterns," and the ferry's salt-worn deck anchor the setting vividly. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (ozone, old paper, frigid air). The grotto's "bones" and the lantern's "trembling gold circle" charge the atmosphere without overwhelming momentum. The stars and grotto do not constrain a tactical choice, but they consistently frame pressure and the final image of stillness. Micro-setting (the hourglass, the wheelhouse) is present but underutilized as a constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly rendered with shifting walls, endless hallways, and spiraling color. Sensory details (the thread "glistening like liquid silver," floor becoming quicksand) are concrete and filtered through Elias's feverish perception. The thread functions as a micro-setting element that constrains movement and charges the final image. However, the void-space ending abandons spatial coherence for abstraction, and the gallery's layout remains generic—no architectural detail unique to this installation pressures a choice.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=6.1)
    The benthic city is vivid in opening description ("corpse of coral and steel," "pressure-forged alloys") and the abyssal plain provides consistent spatial grounding. The chain link receives concrete attention (rusted, pitted, "perfect, unyielding curve") and reappears at closure, but it does not constrain a choice—it functions as symbol rather than tool that alters tactics. The observatory setting is present but generic; sensory hierarchy tilts visual without leveraging pressure or depth. Micro-setting standard is met minimally.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.1)
    The mist-clad atrium is vividly rendered with specific details—glass ceiling, marble rail, defunct fountain—that ground the reader in space and time. The hearing aid functions as both tool and constraint, shaping Lena's method of navigation. The mist itself becomes an active element that coils and recoils, directly affecting Lena's final encounter with Miriam. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, avoiding catalog description.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=7.6)
    Setting is vivid and purpose-driven: the facility "hummed like a dying whale," cables "thick as pythons," walls that "rippled like water" under Elias's palm. Spatial choreography is clean (descent through levels, arrival at observation chamber, step through the wall). The codex—a recurring micro-object—constrains his path by mapping routes that "didn't exist on any blueprint" and dims as he descends, guiding and limiting his choices. The tidal timeframe and flooding pressure are signaled early and return at closure, charging the final image. Environment and object constrain choice and shape the ending, meeting the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.6)
    The opal observatory is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail (frozen jewel, fractured colors, cold metal scent) that anchors mood and constrains the encounter to a liminal space. The porcelain shard functions as micro-setting, handled twice with tactile specificity that charges the mother's memory. The snow-dusted dome and ancient monitor create atmosphere that supports the ghost's ephemeral nature. Environment subtly mirrors Elias's fragmented state without overt symbolism, and the observatory's isolation enables the introspective encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=7.4)
    The bone towers, canyon, and tunnel are vivid and purposeful; the "walls seemed to breathe" and the grooves/ridges function as notes that Elara traces, directly constraining her method. The diamond's light refracting through bone cracks charges the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean (edge → tunnel → out), and sensory detail (hum, pulse, warmth) is filtered through Elara's professional focus. The setting actively shapes the harnessing action and the final triumph.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=7.1)
    The underground garden is sensorially vivid—"damp earth and crushed mint," glowing foxfire mushrooms pulsing "as if breathing"—and the setting charges the closure (the air bending, rules rewriting as Elias metamorphoses). The arrowhead's warmth and the phone's cold receiver provide micro-setting pressure. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling beside mushrooms, phone on shelf). Deduction: the garden's "gravitationally playful" air is told rather than shown constraining a prior choice; it becomes active only at the ending beat.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting is vivid and具purposeful: the enchanted orchard with fruit that never rots, living statues at the edges, and the mechanical wasteland of rusted towers and broken glass. The sky-bridge functions as a literal and thematic threshold. The locust shell (a small object) constrains her choice—its rhythm must be mimicked to break free. Sensory details are selective and support urgency (wind rushing, impact jarring bones, air thick with oil and decay). The cracked speaker in the mechanical world charges the final image, making the violin's resonance matter spatially.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=7.1)
    The cobalt arcade's "ghostly glow of dying neon" and "cracked linoleum" establish atmosphere and reflect decay, but setting remains largely scenic until the jammer dims the lights—a functional beat that alters conditions for the smuggling run. The thunderstorm bottle sits on the counter, visually present but not handled or moved until the final paragraph when Jace tucks it into his bag, charging the ending image. Spatial choreography is clean (arcade interior, back door, implied move toward observatory). The micro-setting (arcade as ruin, border town as liminal space) supports theme but does not constrain a middle choice with cost; it frames rather than pressures.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=7.6)
    The abandoned train, mist, wind bells, and sawdust-oasis are vivid and persistent. The halo fragment's socket and carousel horses constrain the final action—Elias must place the fragment to activate the carousel. Spatial choreography is clean (train car → clearing → carousel center). The setting charges the closure image effectively, meeting the 9+ gate test for constraint, though the "soft" ground/sawdust materialization feels slightly convenient.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.2)
    The library's "scientific poetry library" conceit and hyperbolic-geometry threshold are vivid and purposeful. The scarf's texture ("cool against his skin," "rain and something metallic") is embodied and recurs. Spatial choreography is clean until the void materializes; the star-strewn expanse reads coherent but does not constrain Elias's choices—he steps through and the woman is simply there. The scarf charges the final image ("warm against his skin"), meeting the 9+ gate criterion for Q3, but the void itself remains a backdrop rather than a pressure or resource.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=7.2)
    The archipelago, kapok library, and dawn light constrain Elias's choices (he climbs to the highest point, waits for pure light, borrows an old camera) and charge the final image (the woman on the farthest island holding the palette). Sensory detail is vivid and POV-filtered ("salt-tinged air," "liquid amber," lens "clouded with time"), and the recurring watercolor palette functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats. Spatial choreography is clear (library window → highest point → farthest island) and the environment matters to tactics (photography requires "purest" light, island distance structures the arrival). Reaches mid-7s on constraint and closure linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=6.1)
    The shadowed nexus and starlight anchor the opening; damp earth and ancient oaks provide sensory grounding. Spatial choreography is minimal but coherent—locksmith kneels, walks back, meets Elara by fire. The first star functions as a tool/constraint: its light must be read, shaping the locksmith's ritual. This lifts the score into mid-6s, though the nexus itself never pressures a choice or alters tactics beyond serving as backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sunken greenhouse with its skeletal frame, algae-choked water, and shipwreck sentinels creates a vivid, oppressive micro-setting that constrains Elias's approach and charges the final image. Sensory detail is purposeful: "metallic tang of blood," "water seeped into his boots," "salt air." The fairy ring itself functions as a spatial pressure point—kneeling in knee-deep water to touch it dramatizes his vulnerability. The setting evolution (glass panes shattering as water rushes in) alters the final beat and makes the environment active in the closure, meeting the 9+ gate criteria for constraint and charge.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=7.4)
    The library as forgotten space, the shard-mirror that fractures Elara's reflection, and the afternoon shadow caught in glass all constrain choices and charge the atmosphere. The swing's creak functions as auditory micro-setting that primes Elara's motivation. Spatial choreography is clear (broken window entry, desk with teacup, stone floor). The teacup and its dried leaves appear as tactile objects that enable the final exchange, elevating the setting beyond backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=7.1)
    The verdant parapet and waterfall anchor the scene concretely, and the waterfall's runoff enriches the soil where Maren plants the seed—a clear causal constraint that shapes her choice of location. Sensory detail is vivid and purposeful: mist kisses her cheeks, the roar softens, the air hums. The final image charges the setting as the mist curls around the new tree, reconfiguring the orchard space with the return of lost color. The body-as-micro-setting is present (her calloused hands, breath curling, trembling hands), though it does not constrain a pivotal choice. Spatial choreography is stable, and the setting modulates with the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sanctuary's refracted colors, the mask's light-drinking threads, the net's writhing knots, and the cold air all supply vivid sensory anchors filtered through Elias's restorer's eye. The ladder, needle, and net constrain physical choices and the mask's pulsing threads charge the final image. Spatial choreography remains clear (ladder → rafters → net → mask across the room). The sanctuary functions as micro-setting that shapes Elias's method and the final confrontation, meeting the 9+ gate for environment constraining choice and charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.4)
    The vault, henge, and chapel are vividly rendered with rain-scoured frescoes, moss-slick stones, and iron bars that Elias pries open. The shoe on the altar charges the final image by linking to the footage. Spatial choreography is clean, and the rain and stone textures filter through Elias's framer's eye. The setting constrains his action (sealed door, rusted lock) and the vault-chapel mirror deepens atmosphere, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.1)
    The sunken library is vivid and purposeful: fractured skylight, silt like ash, the desk bolted to the floor all anchor action. The snow globe—water clear, biplane frozen—recurs with reweighted meaning and constrains Elias's final choice. Sensory hierarchy reflects dive priorities (beam, pressure, current). Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The setting charges the closure image: the hull groans in release, the Pacific stretches endlessly. Minor gap: verdigris on a 1930s copper helmet after seventy years underwater reads plausible but the clarity of Liora's face inside strains physics without acknowledgment.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.2)
    The misty courtyard above the clouds is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (mist at ankles, cobblestones, phosphorescent paint, the void at the wall's edge). The bolt plate and graffiti are concrete micro-setting elements that constrain and enable Elias's choices—he crouches to examine the plate, traces the letters, and uses the iron as a key. Spatial choreography is clear (courtyard edge, wall, void). The storm functions as atmosphere and timeframe pressure but does not materially alter Elias's tactics on the page. The setting charges the final image (mist swallowing the courtyard, Elias remaining to play), meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment or object shape the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=6.9)
    The icebound spire, frosted windows, and ice-slicked floor create atmospheric constraint and charge the captain's isolation. The goggles' "scent of engine oil and salt" and the model airship provide texture. The elevator's mechanical presence brackets the story effectively. However, the tenth floor and the captain's quarters function more as backdrop than active constraint on Lira's choices—she moves freely through the space without spatial pressure limiting her agency.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gondola setting is vivid and specific—brass fittings, swaying motion, skeletal docks—and the telescope recurs across beats, but the environment doesn't constrain a choice until the railing climb, which is the first tactile interaction beyond adjustment. The spatial logic wobbles: "tether...snapped years ago, leaving the structure adrift" yet Elias has "spent the last decade here" implies stability. Sensory detail is strong (fogging eyepiece, wind tugging coat) and filtered through Elias's professional lens (cloud taxonomy). The micro-setting (gondola as vessel of "spooled wholeness") charges the final image but doesn't alter tactics earlier.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tree trunk library is vivid and purposeful: "cavernous hollow," "damp paper and time," "towering shelves and the weight of centuries." The coin's indentations guide navigation, making the setting a functional map. The sketch itself—"a thousand shades of blue… fractally precise"—charges the final image when Liora closes the safe. Dawn light through cracks signals the demolition timeframe and adds urgency. The body and safe (lock "so intricate it seemed to breathe") function as micro-setting that constrains action and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=7.1)
    The airship setting is vivid and consistent: brass hull, aged paper and ozone, dusty hopscotch board, porthole. The hopscotch board constrains Elias's investigation—he must kneel, brush away grime, trace irregularities—and the lantern's engraved glass charges the final reveal. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. Sensory detail (creaking joints, starling murmurations, cool porthole glass) is selective and purposeful, anchoring the action without catalog excess.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=6.1)
    The frozen library's "ice and glass" and "driftwood nostalgia" scent anchor setting early, and the hall of mirrors supplies a concrete space for the climax. However, spatial choreography is loose: the workbench's location relative to the hall is unclear, and the gears shift from "across his workbench" to "in his pocket" to "on the floor" without clear transitions. The mirrors function more as thematic device than constraint—they show possibilities but do not block or enable a specific choice with cost. The ending image (gears turning, mirrors flickering) charges atmosphere but does not hinge on a setting detail that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.1)
    The floating arches, nebula glow, and bioluminescent trees are vivid and selective. The villagers' tactile engagement—pressing ears to rocks, letting nebula bathe skin—grounds action in setting. However, the orchard functions primarily as backdrop; no environmental constraint visibly narrows a choice at closure. The watering bell's physical properties (brass, lotus shape) are described but not handled in ways that alter tactics, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse setting is vivid and purposeful: "jagged spit of rock," "cellar, buried under layers of salt and time," the beam flickering to life at closure. The pane of hush as micro-setting (glass pressed, fractures studied) constrains Elias's method and charges the final act. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's long familiarity. The body (trembling fingers, closed eyes, steady hands) anchors key beats. The final image—waves stilled, wind held—integrates setting into the closure's resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cliffside orchard, mechanical birds, and labyrinth create a coherent high-stakes arena; spatial choreography is clear (Mira at maze edge, man stumbling into view, birds circling above). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful: "damp soil," "brass wings glinting," "frost creeping over stones" all reflect urgency and the ticking clock. The nuts as micro-setting objects constrain Mira's choice (she must place them where birds won't notice) and charge the final image (she turns back to the heavy-fruited trees). The mechanical birds function as environmental pressure that shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.4)
    The braided ravine, moss, river, and foam patterns anchor the scene vividly and filter through Lina's professional lens (polymers, bonds). The foam observation constrains her research pivot, charging the middle beat. The chrysalis and ravine return in the final image, reweighting the opening scar metaphor into a navigable map. Sensory selection—wet earth, pine, dim light—reflects urgency and discovery without catalog redundancy.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=6.2)
    The glass orchard library and skylight are vivid, and the bottled moonlight casts shifting shadows that charge two beats (counter display, spillage into key). The ~150-word orientation delay caps this category at 7.0 per Q2. The library's drifting-cloud setting remains postcard description; it does not constrain a choice or alter tactics. Selective sensory detail (ozone, old paper) anchors mood but does not participate in escalation or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=7.1)
    The desert fortress, rain, pavilion, and coral anchor the setting vividly and early. Maren's kneeling to press her palm and analyze tidal formations supplies one micro-choice constrained by environment. The pavilion's "frozen heart" and coral's warmth at the threshold charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate test for environment shaping closure. However, spatial choreography inside the pavilion is vague—Kael is "curled against the pavilion's frozen heart" but their relative positions and the pavilion's interior dimensions remain unclear. The rain and desert pressure are atmospheric but do not alter tactics; the setting functions more as symbolic backdrop than lived-in constraint during the central persuasion beat.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=6.4)
    The astronomical clock tower is vivid and purposeful: brass hands, dusty ledges, gears that groan to life. Mara's body interacts with the space (oiling gears, hanging posters, climbing to the highest platform) in tactile ways. The cuckoo clock weight's polished iron surface catching lantern-glow charges the final platform scene. However, the tower never constrains a choice—it remains a backdrop for community-building rather than a spatial pressure that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=6.4)
    The moonlit canyon provides atmospheric grounding, and the mirror's fractures function as micro-setting that constrains Lena's choice at closure (she cannot erase them without erasing the memory). Sensory detail is selective—moonlight pooling, dust, the mirror growing cold—yet the canyon itself remains more backdrop than active pressure. Spatial choreography is clean (kneel, press mirror to wall, trace fractures), but the environment does not meaningfully limit her options or supply a resource that alters outcome; the final choice hinges on reflection rather than spatial constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto is rendered with vivid, selective detail: bioluminescent moss, inverted stalactites, moisture rising to meet boots. These images constrain Elara's path and charge the final chamber scene where "air itself seemed to bend, refracting light into prismatic shards." The serpentine coil motif and threshold mist recur purposefully, shaping the middle discovery and framing the ending. Micro-setting (the pedestal, the unmarked book) drives the climactic choice. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=7.2)
    The siskin alder grove is vivid and atmospheric, anchored through moss, dampness, and root imagery. The porcelain insulator and sculpture constrain Elias's method (wedging, strumming), shaping his approach across multiple beats. Sensory detail is purposeful if occasionally elevated in register. The hedgehog's uncurling and the grove's "leaning in" charge the final image, meeting the 9+ gate requirement that environment/object constrains choice or charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.1)
    The magnetic nexus is vividly anchored with "violet and rust," "uneven pull," and the glowing stones' heartbeat-like pulse. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, supporting the contemplative tone. The worry stone's dent functions as micro-setting, recurring with physical presence and charging the final choice. The environment constrains attention (silence, magnetic currents, light bending) and the glowing stones participate directly in the closure beat, elevating integration beyond postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.1)
    The workshop is concretely rendered (solder, old paper, copper coil, flickering lantern) and the clasp's brass mechanism constrains Elias's approach, shaping his method. The timeframe—stillness before fireworks—creates ambient pressure, though the fireworks themselves function more as mood than tactical clock. Spatial choreography is clear (workbench, door threshold, lantern glow). Sensory detail is selective and purpose-driven, filtered through Elias's focus on sound and texture. The final firework's light painting the room charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate for setting participation.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.1)
    The treetop village is vividly rendered with swaying bridges, moss-lined balcony, and distant crash of waves, and sensory detail is well-distributed (olfactory sensitivity, visual horizon bleed, auditory rustle). The seed's texture and scent are handled on-page, and the village hum provides social texture. However, the setting functions primarily as backdrop; the balcony does not constrain Mira's choices or enable a tactic under pressure, and the final image does not depend on spatial detail. Idiom is consistent, and spatial choreography (Nara at the balcony edge) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating rock arches, silver-leafed trees, and violet haze create a vivid, purposeful setting that constrains navigation choices—Lira must follow the waterway during the inversion because usual landmarks become unreliable. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Lira's professional attention (damp earth, slick undersides, condensation). The grove's accelerated growth and the vibrating soil charge the closure image when fruit ripens in seconds and bursts into seeds. The micro-setting (soil pulse, trembling leaves) functions as a constraint that shapes her final understanding, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=7.1)
    The shipping-container labyrinth is vividly rendered with jagged shadows, impossible angles, and sensory details (salt, rust, metallic groans). The environment directly constrains Elias's movement in the final chase when "paths rearrange with each step," charging the closure image. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout, and the containers function as both setting and antagonistic force. The piece narrowly misses higher bands because the body and tools (thermal scanner, flashlight) are present but don't deeply constrain his choices—they reveal rather than limit.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=7.2)
    The ice cavern is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (veins of blue and silver, aurora ribbons, ice vibrating in sympathy) and the aurora's restless hues are filtered through Eira's synesthetic perception. The sculpted hush functions as micro-setting, thickening around her to muffle the world. Setting does not constrain a choice with consequence, but the final image is charged by the cavern's response to the released music, lifting the score into the 7s.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=7.1)
    The Thunder-echo Range is vividly rendered through "avalanchingly quiet stillness" and "every footstep sent tremors through the canyon walls," creating a coherent sonic/spatial signature. The flute's warming and vibration provide tactile pressure that tracks across beats. The cavern's "damp stone and something older" and the other side's "thicker, suffocating" silence modulate atmosphere purposefully. The driftwood markers function as micro-setting that guides movement and charges the final rearrangement, meeting the 9+ gate test by constraining choice and shaping the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=6.8)
    The topaz workshop and dying starlight are vivid and repeatedly invoked: refracted rainbows, pulsing walls, glass floor. The halo fragment functions as a micro-setting object that Elias touches and that hums, and its dissolution at the end charges the final image. The book *The Geometry of Grief*, ink-stained fingers, and the letterpress constrain Elias's physical actions and anchor his obsessive project. However, the workshop does not visibly constrain a choice or alter tactics under pressure—it remains evocative backdrop rather than a force that narrows options at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.1)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway supplies vivid sensory detail (ozone, old stone, fractured light) and the pendant functions as micro-setting, vibrating sympathetically to guide her path. The ridgeway constrains her movement and the auroras dim at a key moment, charging the stranger's revelation. The environment shapes the final image: stones shift, the ridgeway "breathes," and the pulsing auroras become a heartbeat that supports her steady step forward. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.2)
    The quartz arbor is vividly rendered—crystalline branches, spectral shards, residual hum—and the frost patterns on the car window provide a recurring image that charges the closure ("patterns gone... simply shifted"). The prism constrains Elias's method: angling it toward the arbor's core to split light is the tactic that surfaces the memory. Sensory detail is purposeful (cold air, visible breath, numb fingers) and filtered through Elias's mystic lens. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The arbor and frost work as micro-setting that shapes both attempt and final insight, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=6.9)
    The orchard, bamboo forest, and city of spires are evocative but operate largely as backdrop. The puzzle map functions as a micro-setting object that guides her steps, and the amber bead constrains her journey by providing direction, both touching the ending. However, spatial choreography inside the cottage and across the journey remains vague—no concrete distances, textures underfoot, or sensory anchors that alter her tactics. The bamboo's "stoically sparkling" recurs but never imposes a physical obstacle or resource choice.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=7.1)
    The floating orchards and hollowed arches create vivid spatial particulars ("roots clinging to pockets of soil," "blue light pulsing" in the fissure). The mine interior is textured with sensory detail (damp stone, rust, condensation) that guides Elias's movement. The silk itself functions as micro-setting, constraining the sealing method and charging the closure image with its glow. Minor slip: the arches' structural fragility is declared but never tests a choice on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.1)
    The repair bay is vividly rendered—ozone, rust, emergency lights, collapsed workbench, cracked console—and its status as a nexus where "walls between worlds thinned" directly shapes the plot. The green shard hums in sync with Kael's pulse and becomes the key to activating the console, constraining the final choice. Spatial choreography is clear (doorway silhouette, stepping forward, pressing shard to console) and the setting's decayed spaceport context charges atmosphere. The environment participates in the closure beat by providing the console that reveals the monument, meeting the 9+ gate test.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lighthouse setting is vivid and purposeful: "bruised twilight," "soot-streaked glass," "iron stairs," the lantern room's cold and hum. The sea glass and stones function as micro-setting that constrains choice and charges the final image. Spatial choreography (skiff, dock, stairs, lantern room, sill) tracks cleanly. The setting does not merely decorate; it enables the stone-stacking action and supplies the lamp that Elias relights, altering the scene's charge.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    The emerald lighthouse, glass lantern, and wick are vividly rendered with strong sensory specificity (salt-laced dark, total internal reflection, starlight). The lantern's mechanics constrain Veyra's method across multiple beats (adjusting angle, pressing palm, bending light). The final image—lighthouse pulsing, city waiting—charges the closure by grounding the abstract promise in the established setting, satisfying the 9+ gate condition for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.6)
    The floating tea house with bamboo stilts, granite slab, and rice-paper walls creates vivid spatial grounding. Sensory detail (valley mist, moonlight through the wing, sun trails) is selective and purposeful. The tea house setting constrains observation but does not shape a concrete choice at closure—the protagonist watches rather than acts. The morpho wing as micro-object charges multiple beats and the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.1)
    The stormlit tower, moonlight pooling "like mercury," and gnarled oaks create vivid atmosphere. The sextant's broken limbs and the spiral stairs supply spatial grounding. Moonlight constrains the healing moment and charges the balcony scene, pushing this into the 7-band. The labyrinth's shifting walls and damp stone recur with purpose, though the lower chamber's sawdust and the pin's origin remain vague.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.4)
    The greenhouse is vividly rendered with specificity (mica windows refracting light, vines greeting, trees as sentinels) and the mica window returns charged at closure when village windows glow in parallel. Spatial choreography remains clear across three locations (greenhouse, path, village square). The alchemical orchard pressures the plot by housing the keeper and the dawn-fruit, and the seed's sprouting provides a concrete environmental anchor for the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library's sensory anchors—old parchment, beeswax, impossible spiral shelves, a humming tome—are vivid and POV-filtered through Elias's decade of care. The paradox section's spatial impossibility charges atmosphere but doesn't constrain a choice; he simply walks to it and finds the map. The midnight clock and the map guide the final move, so setting contributes to closure, but the woman's house (recognized on the map) remains abstract. Micro-setting (the invitation, the book) functions well; the broader library feels more postcard than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.6)
    The overgrown palace courtyard, ivy, moss, and tea house are vivid and filter through Elias's professional gaze. Spatial choreography is clear: path, courtyard, tea house interior, window. The seeds and soil—micro-setting elements—constrain the final planting choice and charge the closure image. Sensory detail (scent of yeast, damp soil, steam) is selective and anchored to stakes. No awkward telescoping or floating-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=7.4)
    The frozen library above the clouds is vivid and consistently atmospheric, with strong sensory anchors (ice, breath curling, quartz hush). The setting constrains Elias's actions through its cold and silence, and the lantern mechanics are spatially coherent. The final image uses the ice and shadows to charge the closure, though the library's vastness could press harder on his physical movements during the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=7.4)
    The pier and pirate market are vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (salt, rust, spilled rum; rotting planks, flickering lanterns) that reflects Lena's familiarity. Spatial choreography is clear throughout the confrontation. The watch fob functions as micro-setting, constraining her choice to step forward and charging the closure image. Minor slip: the "truce of hush" as a setting rule could press harder on tactics in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=7.1)
    The aurora, bluff, and forest election create vivid atmosphere; the sensory detail (copper taste, rain scent, mycelial hum) is selective and filtered through Elara's POV. The compass ring warms and spins, functioning as micro-setting that guides her movement. The forests' synchronized march at closure supplies a charged environmental image, though it does not constrain Elara's final choice—it reinforces theme without altering her options.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vivid ("cathedral of amethyst and quartz") and its violet light recurs with purpose. The lock's physical properties (cold, humming) anchor tactile perception. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves. The cave does not constrain a choice at closure—Elias simply opens the door—so the setting falls short of the 9+ gate, but its atmosphere charges the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.7)
    Verdant Spire's glass domes, humidity, and skeletal plants establish atmosphere effectively. The archives' cracked dome and the preserved flower constrain Liora's path, and the hidden staircase charges the final image. However, spatial choreography inside the studio (workbench, floorboard, inkwell) floats without clear layout, and the broader city remains postcard description rather than a crucible that alters tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=7.6)
    The bluff, sculpture, iceberg fragment, and glass orb all constrain choices: Elias must descend to find materials, the fragment's melting pressures his timeline, the orb's breaking is a tactical decision. The setting is vivid and purposeful ("low vibration that rose from the earth," "frost," "village below"). Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's priorities. The iceberg fragment and orb function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=7.6)
    The glass dome, hydroponic tubes, artificial suns, and crimson desert roses establish a vivid micro-setting filtered through Eli's perception. The roses' blackened edges and the oldest bush anchor the climactic burn. The dome's cracking glass under heat charges the final image, and the "strangely organic soil" Eli brushes at the end reweights the earlier hydroponic artifice. Spatial choreography is clean; the box placed at the base of the bush, the fire spreading, the mist engagement all track coherently.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.1)
    The courtyard at dawn is rendered with vivid sensory detail ("honey, thick and golden, pooling in the cracks") and the rusted mailbox functions as a recurring spatial anchor. The locket's brass surface and stiff clasp provide tactile specificity. However, neither the environment nor objects constrain an on-page choice: Elara's decision to wait is unforced by spatial or material limits. The setting enriches atmosphere and grounds the accumulative design but does not pressure the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.4)
    The sunken laboratory is richly textured: rusted girders, saltwater lapping corroded glass, bioluminescent algae, coral-fused hatch. Spatial choreography stays coherent (corridors → central console → hidden chamber). The setting constrains the final beat: Elara pries open the hatch, revealing untouched glowing vials. Sensory selection (vibrations, warmth of lab coat, weight of dice) reflects urgency and anchors POV. The environment charges the closure image even though that image lacks agency-driven cost.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=7.8)
    The salt crystal chamber constrains the climactic choice—Marlowe must physically kneel, exhume the journal from sediment, and experience gravity fluctuations that pull him toward the center. The docks, lanterns, and vats are filtered through his ritual and grief. Sensory detail (ozone, brine, fogged glass, condensation) is purposeful and selective. The chamber's hum and gravity shifts charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (wharf → chamber → largest vat → center). The micro-setting (journal buried in sediment) serves as both constraint and reveal.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=5.1)
    The nocturnal brook setting anchors spatially and the origami wing functions as a concrete object across beats. However, environment never constrains a choice—the summoner could perform this ritual anywhere quiet. Sensory detail leans heavily visual and metaphorical ("smoothed hush," "tranquil blaze") rather than particular or filtered through POV priorities, reading more like atmospheric wallpaper than lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rooftop garden and meteor shower create a vivid, purposeful frame that anchors the ritual and charges the ending image. Sensory details are selective—silver trails, embroidered constellations, ceramic bowl—and filtered through Elara's attention. The seal's brass texture and worn edges recur meaningfully. The city's towers and spires become an active element when the two decide to "listen" to the buildings, tying setting to stakes. Spatial choreography is clean throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.7)
    The velvet garden is anchored early with sensory detail (petals absorbing sound, dew, cliffs below, roses at the heart). The seashell—handled twice, warm from Liora's grip and again warming at the end—functions as micro-setting and charges the final image. However, the garden itself does not constrain Elias's choice or alter his tactics; it remains atmospheric backdrop rather than a pressure point that shapes the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.1)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and dripping stalactites establish vivid atmosphere and appear in the closure image ("aurora pulsed," "stalactites dripped," "stepped into the light"). The rose thorn and key are handled tactilely. Spatial choreography is mostly clear (workbench, altar compartment), though Vey's approach and final positioning relative to Lian remain slightly vague. The setting charges the ending by framing her exit into light, meeting the 9+ gate requirement, but some professional detail (how forgery tools work, ink mechanics) is gestural rather than specific.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=6.1)
    The serpentine nexus, starlight, and merchant circle provide atmosphere and spatial anchors early. The seashell's tactile detail (jagged edge, warmth) functions as micro-setting. However, setting does not constrain a choice or alter tactics—Liora's path is guided by vibration alone, and the nexus serves as backdrop rather than pressure. The final image invokes the canyon walls answering but does not show environment shaping the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=7.1)
    The glacier shrine, candle-lit and carved into ice, anchors early and recurs (altar, ice groaning, walls fogging breath). The snow globe functions as micro-setting, handled twice (cupped in palms, placed back on altar) and the ripple/tear moment charges the final exchange. Sensory detail is purposeful: residual warmth, fogged glass, ice groaning. The setting constrains Mara's ritual work and the final image of her walking into "borrowed starlight" ties environment to theme, lifting this into solid high-6/low-7 range despite the week of travel being spatially vague.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=7.2)
    The parapet setting is vivid and selective—slick stones, scent of damp earth, fireflies weaving below—and the bamboo whisk functions as micro-setting, handled twice and recalled at closure. The rain-soaked atmosphere is well-maintained and sensory hierarchy (visual fireflies, tactile damp) supports the contemplative tone. However, the setting does not meaningfully constrain a choice; Ren could have this conversation anywhere elevated and mist-shrouded without altering the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.1)
    The wasteland orchard is vivid and specific: "spongy soil," "blackened bark," "leaves shimmering with eerie light." The respirator and radioactive dust establish immediate constraints. The hollow tree and clearing at the center participate in plot turns. The diamond functions as lens/tool and charges the final image by revealing the orchard's healing nature, satisfying the micro-setting gate for high-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=6.1)
    The observatory, cobalt portico, and storm are vivid and purposeful in the opening third; the valley firelight and scavenged platform ground the confrontation. Spatial choreography during the crowd scene is loose—Elias "pushed through" and "stepped forward" without clear blocking of distance, elevation, or how the crowd's gaze shifts. The portico's reflection "flared in his mind" rather than constraining a physical choice or shaping the final image on the page, so it remains primarily atmospheric.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=7.2)
    The loft, dunes, jars, and music box are concretely rendered with sensory detail (salt-crusted wood, tarnished brass, clouded glass). The music box constrains his nightly ritual and the jars shape his new purpose, satisfying the 9+ gate for object-as-constraint. Spatial choreography remains coherent across moves. The setting enables his isolation and the jar-collecting action, but the girl's arrival and the final exchange occur inside the loft without environmental pressure shaping the dialogue or Elias's choice—setting supports but does not drive the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.2)
    The drift-ice marina is vividly rendered with selective sensory detail (groaning piers, frost settling into cracks, salt-crusted crates) and the ice itself constrains the climactic choice—Elias must risk plunging through it to reach the key. The lighthouse beacon functions as a tool that alters tactics at the peak moment. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout. The golden sunset timeframe, however, serves primarily as atmospheric window-dressing; it does not materially tighten decisions or create a felt deadline that shapes Elias's moves.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.1)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct establish vivid spatial anchors. The ice's "subtle give" constrains Elias's kneeling action and signals danger. The viaduct's hum and the mist from the lake supply concrete stimuli that frame the stranger's arrival. Micro-setting (ice, viaduct) charges the final image when both characters turn toward the glowing lake, meeting the 9+ gate requirement.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=6.4)
    The tunnel's "damp concrete and rust" and "flickering fluorescents" anchor early. The hidden door with matching engravings provides a spatial constraint that advances plot. However, the underground room's "ozone and something metallic" and humming machines remain generic; no tool or micro-setting detail constrains Elias's final choice. The lantern as object-setting is handled twice but doesn't charge the closure image with environmental cost.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The repair shop is vividly rendered with sensory anchors (aged wood, lemon oil, frosted windows, dim light) that filter through Elias's POV. The clockwork heart as micro-setting constrains his choice—its post-mortem implantation proves the surgeon's involvement—and charges the final image when he clutches it as "a drumbeat of purpose." Storm imagery at the end supplies atmospheric pressure. Spatial choreography (counter, workbench, stepping outside) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=7.1)
    The acid-sea workshop is vividly established with sensory specifics (groaning iron, hissing acid, fumes curling through floorboards) and applies pressure by dying, forcing the time constraint. The kaleidoscope, arrow tip, and bell are handled as tactile objects. However, spatial choreography inside the workshop remains vague—no anchors for Veyra's position, Elias's workbench, or the bell's mounting—and the final "beyond the workshop's walls" gesture lacks grounding.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=6.1)
    The archive setting is vividly established with "quiet static of forgotten data" and "digital graveyard," and server-room geography grounds the video. Sensory details (frayed patch edges, grainy footage, static) are filtered through Lena's investigative focus. The patch and terminal constrain choice by supplying evidence, but the archive itself remains atmospheric backdrop—it does not force a tactical trade-off or supply a resource at the closure beat. Micro-setting (desk drawer, terminal) does light work without charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lighthouse orchard and ice floes anchor the scene vividly with specific sensory detail (gnarled branches, salt and old paper, grinding floes). The mirrors constrain one choice (Elias presses the fragment, a path appears), meeting the micro-setting gate. However, the orchard's spatial choreography becomes vague during the run to the village, and the ice creature's breach lacks embodied scale or proximity that would pressure Elias's stance.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=7.4)
    The drift-ice marina is vivid and particular: "skeletal thing, built on stilts," "groaning floes," sensory hierarchy filters through Elias's muted perception. The lace parasol tip (micro-setting as recurring object) charges the closure—tucked into coat lining, it marks his transition. The marina's sensory specifics (damp wool, antiseptic, salt, thawing ice) layer through action and constrain the final choice: he remains in this unstable, liminal space. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.4)
    The amber pavilion, vineyard rows, autumn mist, and bus station anchor setting vividly and filter through Liora's professional familiarity (pruning-roughened hands, vines bending but not breaking). The burned letter edge is a tactile micro-object that recurs and charges the confrontation scene. Setting constrains choice: the vacant station's finality and the pavilion's isolation frame her vigil and force the face-to-face encounter without escape routes. Sensory hierarchy reflects her winemaker's eye (plump grapes, canvas rippling, damp earth). The vineyard metaphor ("vines and olive trees," "roots of the oldest oak") borders on overt symbolism but remains anchored in her livelihood.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=6.1)
    The pavilion's "wooden slats groaning," "skeletal hand" structure, and grain-preserved whispers establish vivid sensory anchors. The kinetic parapet beneath adds geological texture. Spatial choreography is clear (dunes, pavilion floor, clearing radius). The mask grows warm at the climax, a micro-setting detail that charges the final beat. However, setting does not constrain a choice—the line walker kneels, waits, and touches the thread without environmental resistance. The conjured clearing thickens air and silences wind but serves atmosphere more than tactical pressure, capping this in mid-6s despite strong descriptive work.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=6.4)
    The lavender field and factory ruins are vividly rendered with sensory detail (dew-kissed petals, light through broken windows, vines curling like fingers) and filtered through Elias's contemplative attention. However, the environment remains largely atmospheric rather than constraining choice or supplying tactical resource—the photographs could be arranged in any quiet space without altering the outcome. The dove gray map case is mentioned and the dove itself appears at the end, but neither object actively shapes a decision or charges the final image beyond metaphoric echo. Spatial choreography is clean and the setting supports tone, but it does not reach the threshold of constraining a choice or charging closure, capping the score below 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.1)
    The library is vividly anchored: aged paper, beeswax, vaulted ceilings, predawn gloom, cold morning air. Sensory detail is selective and atmospheric. The crystal functions as micro-setting—handled across multiple beats (desk, lips, temple)—and charges the final image. However, the environment itself (shelves, shadows, windows) remains largely backdrop; it does not materially constrain a choice or alter tactics. The crystal satisfies the 9+ gate, but the larger setting does not.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=7.1)
    The fog sculpture garden is vividly rendered with "ghostly figures…twisted metal and rusted wire," "static silence," and fog that "curled around his ankles, thick as memory." The driftwood spiral functions as micro-setting, shaping his ritual action and anchoring the closure image (the flat stone at the spiral's center). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, filtered through the prophet's focus on sound ("hush of old videotapes," "mechanical hum") and memory. The garden's particulars—driftwood, fog, sculptures—constrain his method and charge the final image, preventing a white-room effect and meeting the 9+ gate requirement that setting or object constrain choice or charge closure.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=6.1)
    The lunar observatory is vividly anchored with silver-streaked dome and clouds below, and the failing stabilizers add urgency. The clock hand and camera are handled across multiple beats, and the viewfinder fog gives embodied sensory texture. However, the setting functions more as backdrop than constraint; the observatory's collapse pressures the exit but does not shape Elias's choices during the restructure. The photograph's "heat" is a fresh touch, but the final image relies on metaphor rather than environment charging the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=7.1)
    The "radiant haven above the clouds" hospice room is anchored early with frosted glass, golden light, and "pulsing stillness," creating a distinct sensory envelope. The scent description (lavender, rain, vanilla) filters through the POV effectively. The vinyl shard and guitar are handled concretely (strap adjustment, setting case down, strumming). The room's atmosphere charges the final image of Elias staying "until the light outside faded into twilight." However, the setting remains largely static backdrop; it doesn't constrain a choice or supply resources that alter tactics, keeping it just below the higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.1)
    The floating isle, nocturnal observatory, brass telescope, and spiral staircase are vivid and coherent. The key fits "perfectly" into the dais, a moment of micro-setting that enables the descent, satisfying one choice constraint. However, the mirror chamber and the noon sun's appearance at closure do not pressure tactics—they illustrate the resolution rather than shaping it. Sensory hierarchy is present (ozone, cold, flickering lantern) but remains decorative in peak beats.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.6)
    The garden is sensuously specific ("damp earth and something older," "flowers bloomed in colors no one had names for") and the hedge maze, apple tree, and flat stone recur with purpose. The silver-veined map and the maze's shifting paths constrain Lena's movement and charge the final image. Minor slip: "polished river stones" for the child's eyes is generic. Spatial choreography is coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=7.1)
    The grotto's mist, serpentine walls, and bioluminescent glow are vivid and filter through Liora's quest-driven attention. The sea glass in her pocket and the pearl in the crevice function as micro-setting elements that constrain her choices and charge the final image. Spatial choreography is clean (kneeling, wading, emerging). The setting subtly mirrors her internal state (mist as confusion, stillness as resolution) without overt symbolism. However, the grotto does not actively complicate her retrieval—no physical barrier tests her—so it remains more atmospheric frame than pressure source, capping the score just above 7.0.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.1)
    The moss-covered data center is vividly rendered and constrains the final choice: the rusted hook provides the physical anchor for the pendant's placement, and the dripping icicles' lace patterns mirror the pendant's etched lines, charging the ending image. Sensory detail is purposeful (thawing drips, damp earth, fractured light through skylights) and filtered through Elias's observational bias. The setting functions as micro-setting that reconfigures meaning: technology repurposed by nature mirrors the siblings' attempt to graft new meaning onto grief.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.1)
    The feral nexus is vividly rendered: mist that curls "like a living thing," river flowing against itself, air smelling of damp earth and old paper. Spatial choreography is clean—Elias wades deeper, figures emerge and vanish, he turns back—and the liminal atmosphere charges every beat. The setting does not constrain a choice in the middle (the river "urges" but doesn't block), preventing entry to 8+; it does charge the final image of wading against current, lifting the score above mid-band.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=7.6)
    The arbor is sensuously anchored: "cathedral of leaves," "gnarled roots," "crushed mint and something older." Spatial choreography is clear (crouching, palm to bark, walking back). The tendril functions as micro-setting, constraining her wrist and pulsing with her heartbeat, which charges the final image when she tucks a leaf into her pocket as keepsake. The dawn timeframe and the spirals glowing golden directly shape the closure moment. Sensory hierarchy reflects Liora's priorities—scent and texture dominate over visual catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=7.2)
    The subarctic crater orchard is signaled early and its frost-hardened soil, pale sky, and perpetual twilight recur in filtered perception. The discarded objects (teacup, key, mirror, button) function as micro-setting that scaffolds the ritual and charges the final moment when their patterns "sigh" and frame the jar. The mirror catching light and the button tilted "just right" are small constraints that guide Elias's arrangement. Spatial choreography is clear; the circle of objects and the stylus-traced paper remain anchored. Gate met: environment constrains choice and charges the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=7.1)
    The marble cavern with quartz veins and skylight is vividly rendered and anchors the piece spatially. The quartz functions as a tool in the climax: Elias tilts it to sharpen the reflection, which directly enables the boy's appearance and the timer's activation. Sensory details (hum of quartz, damp stone, fogging breath) are purposeful and filtered through Elias's attentive gaze. The setting charges the final image (echoes swirling like fireflies in the cavern) and thus meets the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bronze grotto is vividly rendered with selective, purposeful detail: slick walls, "shingled hush," starlight filtering through the ceiling, and the acoustics that "amplify the transformation." The lamp burner constrains choice—Liora must orient properly, facing the north wall where bronze is thinnest, to guide the flame's hunger. The setting charges the final image: the dripping snowmelt shifts from whisper to song, grounding the closure in spatial and sensory particulars. Spatial choreography is clear throughout, and the environment functions as more than backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.4)
    The loft is rendered through selective, mood-consistent detail (damp wool, warped floorboards, rain-beaded skylight) filtered through Elara's familiarity. The ash wood blank and carving knife function as micro-setting: both constrain the final choice (she picks up the knife, carves, then sets the lion down) and charge the closure image. The skylight's muted light in the final beat softens the carving's edges, directly supporting the tonal shift to acceptance. Spatial choreography remains clear throughout (stove → window → carving blank).

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=7.2)
    The kinetic lagoon, broken carousel, and rusted platform supply vivid, selective details that anchor the fractured mood. The camera wheel is handled twice (warm in her pocket, then sinks) and the lagoon's "water neither warm nor cold, just there" constrains the ghost encounter spatially. However, the carousel halting sets the timeframe but does not apply pressure to a present choice, and the lagoon's physics (man emerges younger) are introduced but not leveraged at closure. Sensory hierarchy is present but the final image relies on atmospheric assertion ("the lagoon hummed") rather than a concrete object or environmental constraint that charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The spaceport's "lattice of collapsed walkways," "broken turnstiles," and jury-rigged irrigation system are vivid and specific. The greenhouse's fogged glass and thriving plants constrain the encounter and charge the closure image. Spatial choreography is clean throughout. The carnival's "neon residue" anchors the timeframe without clutter.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Clocktower Spire's sensory anchors (oil, parchment, ticking clock) and the crystal forecourt's rain-activated hum provide vivid, purpose-driven setting detail filtered through Elias's professional and emotional priorities. Spatial choreography (bench, door, alley, eastern gate) tracks cleanly. The forecourt's quartz stones constrain the final image and charge the closure by making the whispers tactile. Minor: the bear in the alley feels under-integrated spatially (no prior mention of bears in Vaelis's ecology).

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=6.1)
    The barge canal and hold are anchored with sensory specificity (damp wood, salt, "ghost of ink"), and the sundial functions as a micro-setting element when its warmth and needle-spin guide action. The mirror's distorted reflection multiplies the hold into a labyrinth, constraining perception and charging the final image. However, spatial choreography within the hold remains vague—crate positions and the protagonist's movement lack concrete blocking—and the "twilight" timeframe does not evolve or pressure choice after the opening frame.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.6)
    The golden dock under snow, fog, and fulgurite glass create vivid, purposeful atmosphere filtered through Elias's philosophical lens. The rope and knots function as micro-setting that constrains his investigation. Sensory detail is selective and mood-coherent ("oceanic hush," snow muffling sound). The Weeping Shoals name charges the ending image slightly, though spatial choreography remains static—Elias kneels, stands, and kneels again without the environment materially altering his tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The garden's autumn decay and "shadows clung to her like old grief" filter setting through Lena's melancholy and constrain her symbolic gesture (kneeling in damp earth). Sensory detail—"scent of damp earth and decaying leaves," "pale moonlight," wind sending leaves spiraling—varies across senses and supports the tone without postcard cataloging. The garden functions as micro-setting that charges the final image: shadows "stretch long and thin" and swallow Lena, making loneliness spatial and physical. The palace carpet thread anchors occupation and world (royal loom, weavers' needles "like fireflies") without excess exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=6.9)
    The suspended palace and brass contraption provide vivid anchors, and the egg's iridescent shell returns with reweighted meaning at closure. However, the cavern setting remains largely atmospheric—stalactites groan but never constrain a choice. The egg itself functions as micro-setting, warming and cracking under Kaelen's hands, which charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective (dust-choked halls, velvet cushion, damp wings) but the environment supplies mood more than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=6.7)
    The obsidian lagoon, black volcanic sand, and firefighter boots provide vivid, POV-filtered anchors. The coin is handled twice (touched, then observed by the girl) and the sand sifts through Lena's fingers, meeting the micro-setting standard. The lagoon's stillness mirrors Lena's reflective state but does not constrain a choice or shift under pressure. Sensory detail is selective and effective ("kelp-drift peace," "grains clinging to her calloused hands"), and the black sand's volcanic origin ties to the fire/transformation motif. The setting charges atmosphere but does not alter tactics or participate causally in the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=7.1)
    The city's dry fountains and moss-to-dust texture establish atmosphere and recur meaningfully at closure (the spiral staircase beneath the basin). Spatial choreography is clear: doorstep → oldest fountain → grandest fountain → descent. The stained glass box as micro-setting object constrains her morning (prying, tracing) and charges the final door with its constellation etchings. The "leaves" layer and hidden lock provide tactile grounding that alters her choice to descend.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=7.6)
    The nebula garden constrains action: sonar pings cause petals to glow and respond, the environment "remembers," and the petal-storm provides cover for Kael's approach. Sensory details are purposeful—violet/gold petals, brass teeth, ship hums—and the setting charges the final image when "petals closed like a curtain on the past." The calculating gear functions as micro-setting, its physical presence (teeth biting skin, brass spinning) anchoring tactile reality. Spatial choreography remains clear across ship interiors and exterior nebula space.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=7.9)
    The workshop, greenhouse, and ribbon are vivid and particular: wet granite, jasmine vines, cracked glass panes. The greenhouse functions as micro-setting, constraining Elias's path ("retracing his father's steps") and charging the final image where he drapes the ribbon over its entrance. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (lavender and rain, fireflies, monarchs), filtered through Elias's reverent attention. Spatial choreography is clean and the setting evolves across weeks, supporting both atmosphere and the closure gesture.

    The obsidian ridge, tidal shelf, and clock tower create a coherent spatial frame. The rake handle's inscriptions and the pendulum bob function as micro-setting objects that constrain Elias's ritual choice. Sensory detail is vivid and filtered through Elias's diligent, reverential POV: "waves hissed like dying embers," "obsidian slick with spray." The tower's shadow as gnomon and the bob's arc through air charge the final image. The setting pressures choices (treacherous climb, the bob's pause) and the object-as-setting (bob, handle) drives the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.4)
    The cobalt silo is vividly anchored through sensory detail ("damp earth and old metal," "velveteen gloom," "cold light pooling in hollows"). Setting supplies props—niches, wall carvings, riverbank—that Elias moves through, and spatial choreography remains coherent. However, the environment does not constrain a choice or charge the final image; Elias's path through the silo and to the river is exploratory rather than pressured by access or proximity. The silo functions as atmospheric backdrop more than tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.7)
    The obsidian spire and frozen lake anchor the setting vividly in the opening line, and the chamber's frost melting as she writes offers a purposeful sensory shift. However, the environment remains largely decorative—it does not constrain her choices or supply a resource that alters the outcome. The quill is described but not engaged as a tool with physical resistance or limitation. Spatial choreography is clean but the setting does not charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ember alcove is anchored early with vivid sensory detail ("damp ash and old parchment," "fire's glow curled like a sleeping cat") and the mist frames the isolation effectively. However, the setting remains largely atmospheric rather than constraining choices—Elias could conduct this experiment anywhere with a desk and radio. The jar of dust and the alcove's warmth support mood but do not alter tactics or charge the final image with spatial or material pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=7.2)
    The gallery's "vanishing point" conceit and the rocking chair's warmth provide purposeful sensory anchors that recur and constrain perception. The mask's porcelain shards "biting into his skin" and the "dark and sticky" binding offer tactile specificity. Spatial choreography is clean (chair, fireplace, portrait, floor, exit), and the recurring objects (chair creaking, mask) charge the final image when Elias drops the mask into the trash bin. The environment shapes the closure through the portrait's transformation and the chair's final settling.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.1)
    The sewer setting is vivid and purposeful: "damp rot and old secrets," the crumbling archway, brackish water. Sensory detail (stench, flickering candle, rats scurrying) grounds the reader and reflects Elias's priorities. The chronometer cog functions as micro-setting, handled across multiple beats and charged with sedimentary meaning that ties to his investigation. The setting constrains his choices (isolation enables focus but limits audience) and the final archway exit charges the closure image, meeting the 9+ gate test for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.2)
    The velvet library is vivid (aged paper, cinnamon, heavy drapes, oak branches) and the autumn setting anchors tone consistently. The zither is handled in multiple beats (placed on the bench, plucked, played through rehearsals) and its physical properties (soundhole rosette, mother-of-pearl, fragile notes) are woven into action. Spatial choreography is coherent (windows, piano bench, floorboards vibrating). The micro-setting—the library absorbing sound, walls "drinking in the harmony"—charges the final image and satisfies the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=6.7)
    The rusted greenhouse is vividly anchored (iron ribs, cracked glass, sagging benches, damp soil) and returns in the ending moment as "no longer just a relic—it was a beginning," which reweights the space with modest conceptual charge. Sensory detail is purposeful (fractured light, iridescent leaves, translucent fruit skin swirling with colors) and filtered through Mara's culinary lens. However, the fruit-growing sequence compresses "days" into summary, and the climactic vision (kitchen smelling of spices, mother humming) lacks the greenhouse's spatial grounding, briefly floating in white-room abstraction before returning Mara to the floor.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=7.2)
    The lightning tower's "copper veins," "crackling core," and "nectar dusk" atmosphere are vivid and coherent. Spatial choreography (gate, base, tower heart) tracks cleanly. The core's "sickly pulse" and the matchbox pressed to its surface create a micro-setting that constrains the final action, lifting the score toward the 7-band. However, the floating gardens and drone beehives remain abstract; we never see a wilting blossom or a failing drone up close, so the stakes feel more told than shown.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=7.2)
    Setting is vivid and filtered through Elias's professional lens: tide retreating without sound, seaweed sway, clapboard house leaning, orris root scent. The bay and house constrain his choices (he came to escape breathing houses; the house appears and leans toward him). The orris root shard—a recurring object—charges the final image when the house exhales. Spatial choreography is clean. Minor issue: the streetlights "daydreaming" and "forgetting to turn off" is poetic but does not materially constrain a choice or supply a resource at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.2)
    The underwater ruin is vivid and consistent (marble paths, algae, silt, murky water), and the setting constrains the diver's movements (rusted helmet, gloved hand). The tree and fissure function as micro-setting that charges the closure image when the ampoule is threaded into the crack. Spatial choreography is clear throughout. The violet liquid's transformation into animate tendrils wrapping the ruins directly shapes the ending's pressure, lifting this into strong territory.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.1)
    The infinite staircase is vividly established with worn stone, spiraling form, and atmospheric weight. The chipped die's physical detail (rough edge, warmth) recurs purposefully. However, the environment remains largely descriptive backdrop—steps don't constrain Elias's choices or force spatial problem-solving. The hundredth-step pause and the staircase's shudder are noted but don't alter his physical approach or reveal professional expertise. The setting charges the concept but doesn't pressure tactics at the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.2)
    The greenhouse is vivid and purposeful: fogged panes, wet earth, mint, glass bubble above smog. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through the painter's priorities. The moonlight functions as both atmosphere and thematic anchor, and the brush's glow subtly charges the space. The rooftop setting pressures the isolation but does not constrain a pivotal choice at closure, limiting upper-band eligibility.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.4)
    The grotto behind the waterfall is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (damp rock, perpetual mist, wet moss and old paper). The setting recurs across beats (museum Hall of Echoes, bakery, window sill) and the waterfall's roar seeping through cracks grounds spatial continuity. The opera glass functions as micro-setting/tool that charges the final image when the tapestry moves, meeting the 9+ gate requirement. Spatial choreography is clean and the mist-laden atmosphere modulates with the tonal shift from dread to hope.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=7.6)
    The lighthouse, hunger stone, and tide function as recurring anchors that constrain action: the stone's latent radiance hums beneath Elias's thumb, the tide's lowest point provides the window for his experiment, and the lighthouse beam shifts to cast backward at closure, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—"black teeth of the island," "salt air corroding the brass," "kelp and the ghosts of drowned sailors"—filtered through a voice attuned to decay and temporal friction. The yoyo's physical transformation (wood peeling to black glass) and the stone's split demonstrate that objects constrain and enable the protagonist's choice, satisfying the 9+ gate for Q3.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=6.9)
    Funhouse mirrors, rust-and-sugar air, and the opera cloak clasp anchor setting with vivid sensory detail. The mirrors ripple and warp under pressure, subtly mirroring Elias's internal state. The cloak clasp reappears at closure (discarded, "staring up at him like an accusation"), charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clean. The carnival frame remains largely decorative beyond the hall of mirrors; the setting guides the climax but does not constrain mid-scene choices.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=7.2)
    The orchard-on-driftwood setting is vivid and specific, constraining Leeward's platform and providing the raft-as-instrument. Sensory details (salt, sun-bleached planks, fruit "tasted of brine and stubbornness") filter through his tide-prophet lens. The setting participates in the climax (driftwood spins, trees groan) and charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate for constraint. Minor over-description in the middle third slightly dilutes momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=7.8)
    The turtle-shell city is vividly anchored with bone-and-coral towers, spiral streets, and the warm shell Mira touches. The crack functions as micro-setting, constraining her choice to chisel it open and charging the final image when she seeks more fractures. Sensory detail (salt-scented air, slick moisture, greenish glow) is selective and purposeful, filtered through urgency. The spatial choreography from ridge to tunnel to cavern to docks tracks cleanly, and the watchers on the horizon gain weight through their persistent, reweighted presence at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.1)
    The disused station is vividly rendered (ivy, rusted iron, loose floorboard) and the rosebush functions as a motif anchoring the timeframe. The oilcloth wrapping and gold leaf are specific, purposeful details. The setting enables the theft but does not constrain a choice or charge the final image beyond backdrop function, capping the score below 7.5. Spatial choreography (platform, turnstile, ticket booth) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.2)
    The submerged pavilion supplies vivid sensory detail (silt, cold air, water to knees) and constrains movement. The inkwell recurs with reweighted meaning (full to empty, purpose fulfilled). Spatial choreography is clear; the physical environment shapes Elias's route and the note-discovery sequence. The setting charges the final image: "the pavilion breathed" ties place to closure. Environment meets the 9+ gate test by constraining choice and charging the ending, lifting the score solidly despite some generic riverbed description early on.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=7.1)
    The submerged library is vividly rendered with sensory specificity: "leather bindings slick with age and saltwater," "dappled shadows," "arched windows filtered the dim light." The lantern and stamp are handled objects that anchor attention. The library's "reclaimed stillness" and the water-filtered light constrain perception and guide Elias's movements. The setting charges the final image when he chooses to remain "in the quiet, where the truth had always been waiting," making the environment integral to his stance.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=6.4)
    The floating isle, glass basilica, and tea garden are vividly rendered with strong sensory detail (jasmine, damp earth, upside-down bonsai). However, the environment remains largely decorative; the silver chains and platforms do not constrain a choice or alter tactics. The final shattered lantern constrains the ending image, lifting the score slightly, but spatial choreography across beats (workshop, garden, basilica) is vague and the setting functions more as backdrop than pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.2)
    The floating observatory is vividly rendered: rusted girders, fractured glass, cooling circuit breakers, flickering screens. The geode's warmth and the cooling breakers impose a time constraint that affects Lena's urgency, and the metal grating and equipment detritus provide spatial grounding. The charred wedding dress functions as a micro-setting element that charges her grief. However, the final image does not hinge on a specific environmental constraint, and the observatory's specifics (dome, server farm wreckage) do not force a choice at closure.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=6.9)
    The observatory's brass teeth and ozone-and-parchment scent are vivid, and the dome's opening frames the action. The chip's warmth and glow constrain the pilgrim's handling and charge the final beat. However, spatial choreography between Elias and the pilgrim is vague—distance, posture, and movement are rarely specified—and the star cluster's appearance in the feed doesn't alter tactics on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cobalt terrace, driftwood shore, and watch anchor the single scene with vivid, filtered detail (bruised sky, ghost fingers, brass warm from his body). The carved symbol on driftwood constrains Elias's search and charges the uncle's reveal. Spatial choreography is clean: terrace above, shore below, steps between. The boathouse gate is named but not shown, leaving the setting's final constraint off the page.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=7.1)
    The storm-worn parapet is vivid and persistent: slick stones, mist, sea below, wind modulations. Moon-phase detail and the drawer pull anchor micro-setting. Spatial choreography (Elias and Seris stepping toward/away) remains clear. The setting pressures tone but does not constrain a tactical choice or charge the closure image in a way that would elevate into the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.2)
    The coastal kayak launch, weathered dock, salt air, and pebbled shore ground the scene with sensory specificity filtered through Elias's priorities. The kayak's physical resistance (wobbling, scraping) and the utility poles as navigational markers constrain his choices and charge the setting with thematic weight. The island's jagged rocks provide a spatial pivot for the climax. Spatial choreography remains clear across moves (dock → open water → island shore). The micro-setting qualifies: the compass in his pocket and the rocks where it clatters function as setting elements that constrain the final act.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.2)
    The bioluminescent lake anchors setting early with vivid sensory specificity ("faint, eerie blue like the last embers of a dying star") and returns as a guiding element through the labyrinth. The mirrors in the final chamber function as micro-setting that charges the closure image by reflecting Elias's memories, though they don't constrain a tactical choice. Spatial choreography (underground tunnels, narrow passage, two tunnels, chamber) remains clear. The lake's glow "intensified as he stepped closer" and the baseball "grew warm in his pocket" tie environment to pressure, elevating the score into the 7s despite the lack of a direct constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=7.4)
    The orchard under permanent moonlight supplies vivid, purposeful detail: "gnarled branches heavy with fruit that glowed like embers," "scent thick with the memory of cinnamon and clove." Sensory selection reflects Liora's focus (the bark texture, the spice paste sizzling in her palm) and the environment constrains her method—she gathers materials from the orchard's own breath. The trees "leaning in as if to listen" and the orchard's "sigh in approval" charge the closure image, moving beyond postcard description. Spatial choreography (Liora crouched among roots, shadow detaching from trunk, bird perching before her) remains coherent throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.1)
    The midnight glade above the clouds is vividly rendered with sensory specificity (silvered grass, cumulus-rooted trees, ozone and crushed violets), and the dolls' tea set saucer crack becomes a tactile anchor that the cartomancer traces as a map. The body (her trembling fingers, the heel of her palm smoothing creases) and the recurring object (saucer, cloth, ink) all constrain and charge the final image: "her hands rest where the ink met the cloth, where the crack met the sky." The setting is lyric and atmospheric rather than a space that forces concrete tactical choices, but the micro-setting (cloth, saucer, ink) does function as the crucible for the ritual act. The clouds parting "as if yielding to her sorrow" borders on pathetic fallacy but remains within the story's lyric register.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=7.1)
    The *Euthymia*'s recycled hull, algae glow, and papered photographs create vivid micro-setting. The photographs constrain Liora's method and charge the closure (she stitches them, they peel back, the ship enters). Spatial choreography is clean: engine heart, walls, images. The "locked dimension" remains abstract—a "silence," a "wound"—without sensory anchors or mechanics that would let the reader picture it, but the ship-as-reliquary grounds the present action sufficiently.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=6.7)
    Black sand, volcano, midnight beach, and the glass jar are vivid and consistently present. The tremors and ash cough ground the eruption threat. However, spatial choreography between Elias and the woman is vague—no clear distance or blocking. The setting anchors mood effectively but does not constrain a choice or directly shape the ending; Elias's sprint away from the beach means the volcano becomes backdrop rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=7.1)
    The bioluminescent moss, brass goggles, and bronze quill holder provide vivid sensory anchors. The fort's corridors function as a lived-in space Mira knows "better than her own reflection," and the unlit torch in the armory becomes a tactical resource. The moss-light filters perception throughout, and the spatial choreography (governor's room → armory → twilight exit) remains coherent. The setting pressures Mira's choices by limiting visibility during the blackout and offering the armory torch as a signal mechanism.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, and eel-rippled shallows are vividly established through POV-filtered sensory detail ("salt-stiff air," "sand clung to his boots"). The vanishing friction is a striking constraint that directly shapes Elias's recognition of the unraveling patterns. The painted rocks and star dust function as micro-setting elements that enable the final sequence, and the environment charges the closure image when friction returns. Strong integration across the sequence.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.2)
    The observatory setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the storm and lightning providing sensory charge. The darkroom timer and photograph are tactile anchors handled across beats. However, the environment does not constrain a choice—Elias could have this epiphany anywhere—and the storm operates as symbolic backdrop rather than forcing tactical adaptation. Spatial choreography (platform, railing, ledge) remains clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.1)
    The glass atrium and brook provide vivid sensory anchors (murmur, light, shadow) filtered through the scene's tone. The sundial's shadow and needle-card perforations create spatial choreography that charges the final alignment. However, the setting functions primarily as symbolic backdrop rather than constraining choice or altering tactics—Elias and Isolde could conduct this exchange anywhere with minor edits, keeping Q3 below the 7.0 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.4)
    The rusted library's "skeletal ribs" and "metal bones creaking" create vivid, purposeful atmosphere that charges the final image. The coffee tin recurs with tactile detail (false bottom, scraps of verse, key) and the moon/stars frame the timeframe concretely. Spatial choreography inside the library (crate, shelves, doorway) tracks cleanly. The setting constrains choice minimally—the library is destination rather than obstacle—but the stars and library-as-beacon metaphor do reweight the closure image, lifting the score into the 7+ band.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=7.6)
    The tidal arbor is vividly particular: branches sway with ocean pulse, salt mist curls, bioluminescent moss provides twilight light, and the roots reach the sea. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (creak of wood, dark ocean "like spilled ink," spray misting Elias's face). The arbor constrains the action—it's isolated, high, and disrupts compasses—and charges the final image when waves crash against the roots and the platform trembles. Spatial choreography is clean (travelers gather around the piano, clouds part below). The setting is filtered through Elias's priorities (the arbor suits his chaos, the only thing that makes sense). The broken clock on the piano's edge and the underbelly where he found the film anchor micro-setting as well.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=6.4)
    The ridge, bioluminescent blossoms, and twin moons establish vivid setting detail early. The seed's physical properties (glyphs, warmth, sprouting pages) anchor micro-setting, and the ridge functions as a "living archive" at closure. However, the village below remains generic, and spatial choreography during the planting lacks tactile specificity—no sense of soil texture, root resistance, or bodily effort. The blossoms light her path at the end but do not constrain a choice; they remain postcard ambiance. Strong sensory detail without decisive constraint on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.4)
    The islet after rain is anchored early with concrete sensory detail (salt, damp earth, mist, pine droplets). The compass and lace function as micro-setting: the compass hums beneath Elias's touch, the lace's stitches guide his fingertips, and both constrain his process of diffusion. The breezy islet and cottage setting enable the final act (mending the bonsai with the lace thread), charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse functions as a crucial micro-setting that pressures choice and charges the final image. Its "crooked" ribs and "damp wood" constrain her posture and focus. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through her expertise (dust as "constellations"). The environment decisively shapes the closure, as the "quiet after the storm" is the necessary condition for her new research.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is indispensable, not backdrop. The canyon's quiet, frost patterns, and creek pressure Liora's choices and guide her via the ledger's routes.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.0)
    The abandoned carnival is a vivid, pressure-filled environment that constrains movement and choice (the maze of stalls, the vault's concrete base). The piano bench and keys function as a micro-setting that directly enables progression. Sensory details are selective and purposeful ("smelled of stale popcorn," "warped by humidity"), filtered through Mira's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting (greenhouse, forge, shipwrecks, aurora) is vividly specific and constrains choice—the forge is the tool for imprinting. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered. The environment charges the final image and actively shapes the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=9.0)
    The emerald station and jar of moonbeams are not merely decorative; they constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory details (glowing windows, cool jar surface) are filtered through Lira's POV and escalate pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting is vividly selective (rust, flickering bulbs, dripping ice) and constrains choice: the control room supplies switches that mirror Elias’s internal calibration. The bookmark recurs with charged meaning. Sensory details are POV-filtered and purposeful, avoiding cliché. Environment meaningfully shapes tactics and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vividly specific and pressures choice: the rusted library’s damp paper and rust, the starlight, the loose floorboard all constrain tactics. The seashell and cast function as micro-settings that charge the final image. Sensory selection reflects Mira’s urgency, and the closing stars burn brighter to reconfigure the moment.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.1)
    Sensory details are vivid and selective (marbled hush, salt spray, wet earth). The ridge fort and pebble shore constrain choice and charge the final image—the fort becomes a gateway, the pebbles echoes. Object-as-setting (booklet) evolves and dissolves, directly shaping the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.8)
    Vivid, selective sensory detail filtered through the robot's perception. The ice violin as a micro-setting object constrains choice (touch triggers loops) and decisively charges the final image with reweighted meaning. Spatial choreography and tone are coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.9)
    Vivid, selective sensory detail (slick cobblestones, scent of celluloid) filtered through POV. The lens object constrains choice and charges the final image; forecourt bookends with tonal resonance, though its "whispering" is slightly decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.5)
    The garden maze is a micro-setting that actively pressures choices (narrowing paths, rising roots) and charges the final image (seedling in dry fountain). Sensory details are filtered through Elias's expertise and urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    Setting is vividly specific (bioluminescent algae, gas giant) and integrates seamlessly with action; the magnetic nexus and lever function as micro-setting objects that constrain choice and charge the final image, enhancing atmosphere without momentum loss.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.0)
    Flooded opera house and flickering lanterns constrain choices (wading, light) and charge the final image; sensory detail is selective and vivid.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=9.4)
    Setting is a masterclass in selective, pressure-bearing detail. The station’s "metal bones groaning" and the valley like a "bruise" reflect internal state and constrain action (isolation forces self-confrontation). The recurring object (illustration) decisively charges the final image. Sensory hierarchy is flawlessly filtered through Elias's professional and emotional focus.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sensory details (wet concrete, clanking) are filtered through Elias's urgency. The mill and tunnel constrain choice; the beaded valve wheel charges the final image by returning to halt the ghost shift.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is vividly sensory and integrated; the obsidian refuge and library constrain choice (the book is dissolved at the river) and charge the final image with tangible atmosphere, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is vividly selective and integral to the concept of ordinary magic, filtering through Elias's musical perception. The creek, meadow, and eclipse charge the final image and subtly constrain choice by drawing Elias to the water and the gathering. However, the setting does not actively pressure tactics beyond atmospheric guidance, keeping it from the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.4)
    The silo library is vividly sensory and purposefully constrains choice; the tapestry object charges the final image. Details like "smelling of old wheat and rust" filter through Elara's perception, integrating setting with character goal.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.1)
    Setting is integral, not decorative: the lighthouse's beam "bends" to hide the clue, constraining choice and charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and filtered through Elias's urgency.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting (dimensional anchor) and objects (loop pedal, palette) actively constrain choices and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, woven through action. The anchor's reactivity and the violet's spread create a coherent, pressure-filled atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting is indispensable, constraining choice and charging the final image. The glass spire and frozen lake are vividly filtered through Liora's perception, with sensory detail purposeful and selective (e.g., "fractured prisms," "cold pane"). The mirrored horizon concept is fully integrated into stakes and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glowing viaduct and clay tablet function as micro-settings that constrain choice and charge the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (wet stones, ozone smell). The environment subtly mirrors internal states (viaduct as mirror) without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.3)
    The cavern as a sound-absorbing environment is indispensable; it constrains the action and charges the final image. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful ("the air hung thick," "faint vibrations to hum through the stone"). The setting is filtered through POV and actively pressures choice—the "audibly muted" quality is the crucible for the climax. Micro-setting (the drum, the needle) functions as an extension of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.0)
    Sensory details are selective and purposeful, with the courtyard and storm recorder charging the final image; setting filters through POV and constrains choice via atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=9.1)
    Greenhouse setting pressures choice via its role as a place "for those who can't let go," and the ultraviolet lamps charge the final image with "colors that didn’t exist." Sensory detail (damp earth, fogged glass, hum of lamps) is selective and filtered through Elias's POV.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=9.0)

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=8.2)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse is vivid and specific, with concrete details like “metal ribs bent” and “glass panes cracked like spiderwebs” that align with the mood of loss and persistence. The environment mirrors the thematic concerns of decay and repurposed growth, and elements like the microscope, damp wood, and darkening sky are integrated into Elara’s actions. While the setting doesn’t sharply constrain her choices, it clearly charges the final image of her staying put as the sky darkens again. The greenhouse feels lived-in and thematically necessary rather than a generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.8)
    The canyon, creek, frost, and starlit quiet are richly evoked and consistently filtered through Liora’s gaze. The frost patterns and canyon veins meaningfully intersect with the smuggling routes, integrating environment with plot. Weather and silence support tone more than they constrain choices, but they do not feel ornamental. The setting feels specific and lived-in without lapsing into a mere landscape catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=8.6)
    The winterglass conservatory, frosted panes, and humming city outside create a vivid, specific atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. Setting details are filtered through Elias’s altered relationship to sound, making the environment feel inseparable from his condition and goal. The winterglass pane and the device both constrain and enable the climax—he must use this exact space and tool to manifest the “music.” Worldbuilding around “unshaken marvels” and the conservatory’s purpose is economical yet evocative, supporting theme and tone.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=8.4)
    The underwater city library and shoreline are rendered with vivid, selective details—oilcloth, algae-slick sand, domed ceiling seen through clear water, the scent of “old paper and salt.” Setting is strongly filtered through his professional and emotional priorities (books on funerary rites, preserved shelves, lenses on the desk). The environment does exert some gentle constraint (wading, doors that groan, water parting) but functions more as atmosphere and mythic frame than a hard tactical obstacle. The recurring objects (lens, books, stained glass) effectively charge the final glow image, though the world’s rules remain intentionally soft.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=8.0)
    The terra-cotta arbor, ridge, caves, and valley are specific and cohesive, and the arbor functions as a micro-setting where community, memory, and the bells converge. Environmental detail is selective but evocative (sun-warmed tiles, oil lamps, amplified quiet) and clearly filtered through Liora’s role as caretaker. The setting charges the final image, though it seldom constrains tactical choices beyond serving as sanctuary and ritual locus.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integral: the viaduct, river, twilight, and wisteria are not postcard details but a charged liminal space that mirrors and hosts the spiritual experiment. Fog that thickens and parts with breath connects environment directly to the core method and stakes. The camera obscura and jade tear function as tools/objects-as-setting that frame her options and charge the final understanding. This world feels coherent and sensorially rich without over-explaining its rules.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=8.4)
    The living bridge garden and the gaslit street are both sensorially vivid and filtered through Elara’s relationship to time and memory, not as generic backdrops. The garden actively shapes choices (guiding her through the maze, manifesting the willow doorway, humming at the end), so environment constrains and enables action. World rules around time-bending vegetation and retrocognitive moments are consistent enough for this length. The only limiter keeping this below the top band is that the gaslit street, while atmospheric, could press on Elara’s options a bit more concretely beyond mood and crowd-echo texture.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned carnival is vivid and specific—the rusted rides, prize redemption center, cotton-candy kiosk, and Ferris wheel foundation all feel tactile and thematically apt. Setting meaningfully constrains action: the prize counter hides them, the piano bench hides the keys, the grounds create a maze for scavengers, and the wheel literally sits atop the vault. The environmental decay mirrors the salted earth and the regime’s collapse without being overexplained. The dawn exit with lighter chains uses place and light to charge the final image, satisfying the “object/setting charges closure” gate.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the sunken orchard greenhouse, shipwreck ribs, aurora, rust, and barnacles all cohere into a haunting, tactile atmosphere. These details are filtered through Elias’s perceptions and synesthesia, so they feel lived-in rather than touristic. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain his choices (he could, in theory, conduct this experiment elsewhere), it meaningfully charges the final image of the forge and foil with decay, legacy, and immersion in lost things. The world’s rules around sound and color stay consistent and are conveyed through perception rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.0)
    The emerald station, firefly windows, and shimmering tiles create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that aligns with the story’s preoccupation with light. The train and its timing provide light environmental pressure, framing the choice to board or not. The jar and white rose act as micro-setting objects that charge the final image and anchor the thematic turn. While the station itself doesn’t strongly constrain tactics beyond the departing train, the sensory specificity and tonal fit are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=7.8)
    The control room and melting exterior are vividly rendered—“dormant dials,” “hummed like dying bees,” and the dripping ice as metronome all create a textured, lived-in atmosphere. Details are filtered through his sensibility as a craftsman and thinker, which keeps the setting from feeling like generic ruin porn. The environment supports theme at the end, with the room coming alive against the ongoing thaw, but it rarely constrains his options beyond providing a contemplative refuge. The bookmark as a recurring object nicely bridges setting and character, though its influence is more symbolic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=8.0)
    The rusted library under cold starlight is vivid and tonally apt, with good tactile detail (iron shelves, groaning hull, damp paper, rotting floorboards). Setting interacts with plot—the loose floorboard and hidden box, the caretaker’s role as guardian of the space—and the recurring stars in the final line subtly charge the closure image. Sensory focus remains mostly visual, but the seashell’s auditory presence helps. It stops short of feeling utterly indispensable, but it’s far from generic.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: storm, ridge fort, pebbled shore, and the lone star are all sensorially specific and recur in altered form at the end. Environment constrains choice—the lull in the storm and the fort’s emptiness create the opening for the ritual—and then charges the final image when the storm returns “softer, as if it, too, had been mapped.” Details like “marbled hush” and “deep, marbled blue” integrate atmosphere with theme rather than feeling ornamental. The world remains narrow in scope, but for this length it feels fully inhabited and tonally aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=8.2)
    The frozen courtyard and twilight light are vividly rendered (“reflecting the last traces of daylight like a shattered mirror”) and stay consistent as a frame for the entire piece. The transparent ice violin functions as both setting-object and mystical tool, charging the final image when he returns to sweeping with the “ghost of a melody” in his circuits. Environmental details (cold, frost, reflective surfaces) mirror his liminal state between machine and something more. While the courtyard doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, it does effectively define mood and isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.6)
    The cinema and projector are vividly and economically evoked, with textures of rain, celluloid, and empty lobby contributing to a hushed, liminal atmosphere. The “crystal whispering forecourt” and damp cobblestones give a distinctive opening image, even if that exterior environment doesn’t later constrain choices. The lens and ticket stubs work as micro-setting objects that recur and are folded into action and meaning at the end. This is strong atmosphere, though the world around the cinema feels more decorative than functional in terms of altering tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.6)
    The garden maze is vividly realized and integrated: narrowing paths, shifting roots, the dry fountain, and metallic seedling all mirror Elias’s age and the story’s withering/blooming dynamic. The maze constrains his movement and enables the central discovery, so environment is not just backdrop but an active, quasi-sentient force. Recurring objects (hedges, fountain, marbles, seedling) are well-scaled and charged. Sensory detail is selective and motivated by Elias’s gardener’s eye rather than tourist cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    The xenobiology station above a gas giant, bioluminescent algae, and the humming xenos create a vivid, textured environment with a strong sensory palette. The station’s systems (atmospheric balance, electromagnetic alignment, observation deck) directly enable the nexus and thus the experiment. Setting is filtered well through Elara’s professional lens (“sky mechanic”), integrating tool and environment rather than offering a tourist catalog. The final sense of an abandoned, overgrown station pays off early details, though the environment could constrain her choices more sharply to reach the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=8.5)
    The flooded opera house is vivid and purposeful: water, darkness, and lantern light are not just backdrop but active forces (half-submerged pit, wading, water as a literal score and threshold). The atmosphere—decayed grandeur, damp air, flickering lanterns—matches and intensifies the story’s liminal aesthetic. World rules around water-images and the in-between remain consistent enough to feel coherent. The environment also charges the final image (lanterns extinguished, water stilled, violin warm in her hands), giving the setting real closure weight.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mountain weather station, ridge, and valley are vividly and economically rendered, with images like “the valley stretched like a bruise” and wind “groaning” through metal bones. Setting tracks coherently and mirrors the internal state—isolated, high, liminal—but does not significantly constrain tactical choices beyond providing solitude and a clear vantage. The disturbed clearing and flower lore tie environment to theme in a satisfying way. A slightly stronger sense of physical exertion or risk in the descent could have deepened the setting’s functional pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mill and tunnel are vividly evoked through smell, cold, rust, and debris, and the industrial atmosphere is consistent and effective. Details like the beaded valve wheel, the plywood barrier, and the “guts” of the mill feel tactile and grounded in Elias’s perceptions. The environment adds unease and plausibility to the ghost-shift idea, though it rarely constrains his choices beyond mood and a general sense of trespass. Still, place and object clearly charge the final image of the wheel being fitted back, which strengthens closure.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is richly particular—the overgrown library in catacombs, the obsidian outcropping, and the river all feel tactile and lived-in. Environmental detail is consistently filtered through her sensibility (e.g., shelves like roots, silence as regenerative) and supports tone. The obsidian refuge and river also meaningfully charge the final image by hosting the book’s dissolution and her return to silence. The world’s rules are hinted rather than explained, but remain internally consistent and sufficient for this scope.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=7.4)
    The town of Sage Ridge, the creek, the old oak, and the eclipse meadow are all vividly sketched and thematically aligned with “ordinary magic.” Details like the mountains “cradling” the valley and the oak shading lovers give the place an atmosphere of benevolent sentience that supports the story’s aims. The setting does participate in the action—the creek “answers,” the trees lean in, the town’s layout enables the eclipse gathering—though it rarely constrains choice in a tense way. The recurring natural environment helps charge the final communal image even if it never quite becomes a pressure device.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and thematically integrated: the reclaimed silo, nautilus-like shelves, grain-smell, half-burned diaries, and stone/wood all feel tactile and lived-in. Environment meaningfully charges the final image—the walls’ hum, the concrete under her palm, and the tapestry on the desk work together as both medium and interlocutor. The “after the last human dream” frame is atmospheric rather than logistical, but the physical space of the silo clearly shapes what’s possible (solitude, resonance of walls, discovery of the diaries). It stops just short of constraining a concrete choice under pressure, which keeps it out of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lighthouse and island are specific and functional: the Fresnel lens and the spot “where the light bends” are integral to how the clue is hidden and found, not just atmospheric garnish. The contrast between Blackthorn Isle and the Golden Dragon kitchen gives a nice textural range while staying focused. Weather, fog, and rocks are sketched with restraint but help justify the isolation and secrecy. The final image of the lighthouse beam and “new key” effectively marries environment and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=8.3)
    The “dimensional anchor” is vividly evoked and integrated; its humming walls, tremors, and final groan respond physically to Elias’s actions, functioning as both environment and barometer of risk. The loop pedal, palette, and violet color are tactile, specific tools that charge the atmosphere and recur meaningfully in the ending image. Details feel filtered through Elias’s ritual focus and are economical rather than touristic. The only limitation is that the anchor’s world-logic and constraints remain evocative rather than fully exploited to force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=8.2)
    The glass spire, frozen lake, and mirrored horizon create a vivid, specific environment that’s tightly braided with the interior stakes. Details like the “frozen breath” spire and fractured prisms are concrete, not generic, and recur meaningfully. The setting doesn’t constrain physical tactics much, but it absolutely charges the thematic field and final image (the horizon’s slight “crack”). It feels like a real, inhabitable place refracted through her emotional state rather than a postcard backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.1)
    The glowing viaduct, storm-cleared sky, “energy that wasn’t quite light,” and ozone/wet stone give a strong, integrated atmosphere that reflects Elias’s internal disorientation. The environment recurs (bridge → mud beneath → abstract labyrinth echoing the same sensory cues → return to the bridge), charging the final image of dimming glow and rain. However, the setting rarely constrains specific choices beyond mood; the labyrinth remains largely conceptual rather than spatially or tactically felt. A single concrete environmental obstacle linked to the labyrinth would push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=8.5)
    The drum maker’s cavern is vivid and functionally integrated: the “audibly muted” space and stone that swallow sound directly enable the theme of felt rather than heard music. Details like hides, aged wood, lantern light, and the tactile vibration through stone are selective and purposeful. The environment constrains options (no audible sound, only vibration) and charges the final image of silent drumming. World rules—deafness, muting, physical resonance—remain consistent and carry thematic weight.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: damp cobblestones, bruised sky, and rain-slick fountain all mirror the bruise-like secrecy and post-storm tension of the city. Environmental details like the scent of wet moss, the mechanical rhythm in the wind, and the reflected stars in the fountain are filtered through Elias’s storm-attuned perception. The courtyard and recorder function as a micro-setting threshold that charges the final image—it's no longer just a quiet place but the edge of danger. World rules around the sealed quarter and pigeons are sketched efficiently without exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse of extinct plants, UV lamps, and skeletal orchids are vividly rendered and thematically integrated with grief and memory. The environment doesn’t strictly constrain tactics, but it meaningfully charges choices and images (a place “for those who can’t let go,” the orchid’s faintly pulsing veins, the greenhouse blooming in impossible colors at the end). Sensory detail, especially smell and light, is selective and purposeful. The setting is inseparable from the story’s mood and meaning.

    The terra-cotta grotto and its amber, breathing walls are vividly realized and tightly integrated with the premise of warped time. Environmental details (pulsing walls, carved grooves, stalagmite) are not just scenic but instrumental: they anchor the rope, shape her movement, and literally house the time-bending effect. Sensory specificity is high and mostly filtered through Lirien’s poetic sensibility, which reinforces atmosphere. A bit more sense of physical constraint or danger from the environment itself could have pushed this into the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=8.6)
    The sunken greenhouse and ring of shipwrecks are vivid, concrete, and tightly integrated with the premise—acoustics, silence, memory, and ruin. Details like the arched ribs “like the ribs of the shipwrecks,” fish flashing by the glass, and moss-slick stone all feel filtered through an ear-first musician in a drowned world. Crucially, the environment isn’t postcard-only: its resonance properties enable the hum, shape her music, and charge the final sense that the world is still speaking. The setting could push even higher if its constraints imposed harder choices (e.g., physical danger, access limits) rather than purely aesthetic ones.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=8.3)
    The amber grotto and the petal are sensually and thematically rich, with the light, warmth, and “last golden breath of dusk” tightly woven through action and interiority. The environment doesn’t constrain physical tactics much, but it strongly charges the emotional and thematic field, especially in the final contrast between grotto glow and “stepping back into the dark.” Details feel filtered through Liora’s sensibility and are economical rather than touristic. Very strong atmosphere that meaningfully supports the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.4)
    The “breezy library under stars” and the Harbor’s Rest Inn are vividly and economically rendered, with salt air, aged paper, and flour-dusted forearms grounding the world. Setting details are filtered through Elias’s occupational and emotional lens, especially his attention to maritime ledgers and dockworkers. However, environment rarely constrains options or tactics beyond providing plausible locations for the envelope and Mara. The atmosphere strongly supports mood and theme, but the world doesn’t decisively shape the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=8.6)
    The crystalline orchard, obsidian arbor, and silver lake create a vivid, coherent otherworld that feels tactile and particular. Setting is not mere backdrop: the arbor’s properties and the orchard’s lore directly shape what Liora and the travelers can do and how belonging manifests. Glass, reflection, and webs recur in images that align with the kinship theme without feeling forced. The environment effectively charges the final image of her hand-line in charcoal as part of this landscape’s living pattern.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rooftop canals, bridges, spirals, and the eye-carved chamber are vivid, tactile, and consistently filtered through Liora’s focused, quest-driven perception. Setting informs choice (upward vs. downward path, spiral descent) and the hourglass pedestal is a clear, charged focal object. Environmental details (cold air, vibrating stone, black water in spirals) heighten tension rather than stall it. The world’s rules around time-echoes are sketched more impressionistically than rigorously, but they remain internally consistent at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=8.7)
    The cavern orchard is vividly rendered and specific—stalactites dripping into roots, glowing fruit, mosaic stones—and these details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility (patterns, cracks, “fractured, yet whole”). The environment isn’t just decorative: it functions as a ritual apparatus and charges the final image (“the silence no longer empty but full”). The glass eyes and stones operate almost as micro-settings, deepening the atmosphere and thematic work. It stops just short of a 9 because the environment shapes mood and meaning more than it constrains concrete choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=8.2)
    The library is richly specific—emergency lights, marble floors, lemon oil, dust motes—filtered through Elias’s archivist gaze, and the vents and floorboards feel tactically used rather than decorative. The outage’s half-darkness shapes his movements and the librarians’ flashlight patrols, giving the environment real leverage over choice. The city’s flickering lights and the hush of the east wing reinforce tone without bogging pace. At the end, the beam of light physically and symbolically pins the stakes, charging the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    The nursery, greenhouse humidity, mossy trellis, and storm season are vividly rendered and filtered through Mara’s botanical sensibility. Weather and wet ground subtly constrain action (she goes outside to breathe, she kneels in mud, the storm’s rumble frames her non-flinch at the end), and the recurring rain/storm image charges the closing sense of ongoing change. Detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The environment could shape tactical choices a bit more strongly, but it already does solid work in mood and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tidal island, post–water wars world, and amber cave are sharply rendered, with detail filtered through his fatigued, obsessive gaze. Weather and geography genuinely constrain action—the rain creates the trails he follows, and the returning tide actively swallows paths behind them, charging the closing image. World rules (rain carrying memory, drowned stories) feel internally consistent and thematically aligned without over-explanation. The setting is not just backdrop; it materially shapes what’s possible and what it means to choose at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=8.5)
    The “musical crystal cave” is vividly and economically rendered—the humming air, bioluminescent quartz, and singing stalactites create a strong, coherent atmosphere. Setting is not postcard-only: the cave’s music, light, and the central stalactite/pearl configuration directly frame the ritual and its failure. The final image of Elias in “bright darkness,” with softened crystal song, shows the environment reconfigured by events and charges the closing moment. A slightly stronger sense of spatial constraint during the climactic surge of shadows could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.6)
    The ivory harbor after rain, slick docks, and watchtower are vividly rendered with purposeful sensory detail that suits an archivist’s eye. Setting is integrated into action (harbor crossing, alley, tower interior) and atmosphere, rather than isolated description. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics beyond mood; the storm residue and architecture don’t significantly alter what’s possible. The valves themselves function almost as a micro-setting, charging the final image, which boosts the score.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=8.3)
    Atmosphere is a major strength: the “starlit vault,” mist behavior, constellation-etched manhole, and jar-lined tunnel all feel tactile and tonally unified. Details are filtered through Elias’s route-mapper sensibility (cracks as arrows, constellations as a map), which anchors specificity to character. The environment constrains action in concrete ways—the arrows direct him, the manhole offers an entry point, the ladder and tunnel guide the descent. While the surface city drops away once he goes underground, the chosen details are economical and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tower on the cliff, salt wind, moonlight, and whale-song create a strong, coherent atmosphere that feels lived-in rather than touristic. Environmental details are well integrated into action and realization—the brine-laden gust and the whales’ calls act as catalysts for his hesitation and eventual surrender to the experience. The tile as a physical locus of the intangible adds an effective micro-setting anchor. The environment enhances mood more than it constrains choices, which keeps it just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=7.2)
    The prismatic escondite, fractured light, magnetic fields, and solar storm are vividly rendered and integrated into the action (“fields warping around him,” “pulling at the fabric of reality”). Setting choices support tone and concept, and the environment evolves with the conflict (storm peaking and then going still). However, the space rarely constrains tactics or forces specific choices; it feels more like atmospheric amplification than a true pressure mechanism. Still, specificity and consistent world-rules keep the scene grounded and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=7.5)
    The prep room is vivid and sensorial from the first line (“formal­dehyde and old roses”) and remains present as a textured backdrop rather than a white room. The contrast between a funeral home and an object that can rewrite systems underlines the theme of a world that “refused to stay buried.” The setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices—this could almost happen in any back room with a table—so its influence is more atmospheric than logistical. Still, the recurring dead/ledger imagery charges the final sense of something new “taking shape” in this liminal space.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mountaintop bonsai labyrinth, silent town below, and flickering fluorescent lamp are vivid, selective, and strongly filtered through his sensibility, creating a palpable, slightly uncanny atmosphere. The bonsai forests and shop imagery recur and evolve, culminating in the final image of leaves “shimmering like gilded paper,” which recharges both setting and vocation. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain concrete choices, but it deeply charges the stakes and tone of his work with time and echoes. Overall, the setting feels integral rather than postcard-like.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.2)
    The port maze and shipping containers are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elias’s obsessions (“a city unto themselves,” graffiti as “ghosts”). Details like diesel, low tide, mudflats, and waterlogged objects create a tactile, lived-in world that mirrors his search for eroded memories. The tides and container labyrinth subtly shape his movements and the story’s cadence, especially at high/low tide and in the final image with the incoming water. Setting is not merely scenic; it meaningfully supports tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=8.3)
    The observatory and cliff are vividly realized—“clung to the cliff’s edge like a forgotten thought,” salt wind, peeling constellation murals—and the environment is consistently filtered through Elias’s attention. Setting details like the abandoned cello and broken dome are not mere decoration; they become functional conduits for the echo-effects and charge the final image of tide versus universal hum. The atmosphere stays tonally aligned with the story’s melancholy awe. The setting shapes mood more than tactical options, but it’s integral to the piece’s identity.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=8.4)
    The raft city carnival is vividly and economically rendered—“drifted on the swollen river like a dream half-remembered,” “neon signs flickering to life above the water” and the hidden archives all feel specific and lived-in. Setting is consistently filtered through Lan’s priorities (gentrification, patterns, archives, graffiti routes) rather than as a tourist catalogue. The foundation stone chip and graffiti operate as micro-setting elements that are tied into action, though the stone’s physical environment doesn’t constrain choices beyond symbolism. Weather/river dynamics are hinted but not deeply leveraged to pressure tactics, keeping this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=8.4)
    The lunar summit is vividly evoked through Earthrise, regolith texture, chemical displays, and the silence of vacuum, all filtered through a professional yet poetic eye. Details like the micro-impacts, scanner readouts, and film camera integrate setting with character and theme rather than feeling touristic. The environment mostly serves as charged backdrop rather than concrete constraint; Elias is never forced into different tactics by terrain or hazard. Still, the moon’s atmosphere and objects (crater, lander, tools) meaningfully charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rail depot, mist, salt, machine oil, and water basin are vividly and economically realized, with sensory detail filtered through Elias’s non-visual priorities. The environment meaningfully interacts with action: the mist informs the drone’s mapping design, and the water feature’s refraction test shapes his decision to launch. World rules (sound in mist, tactile diagnostics) are consistent and quietly taught through use, not exposition. The closing image of mist and the depot’s calm reinforces the mood without feeling decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=8.3)
    The frozen lake, rusted outpost, and condensation on the window are vividly drawn and tightly integrated with the story’s concerns about memory, mapping, and origin. Environmental details are filtered through Mira’s professional eye (the blank map, the “Here be nothing” note) and the weather meaningfully shapes atmosphere and stakes. The ice and cold constrain choices and charge the final request to be taken to the lake’s center. The setting feels specific and lived-in without veering into cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful, from the “cloak the color of old bruises” against the crumbling market square to the archway as a “fault line…of time” and fulcrum of the town’s resonance. Details are filtered through the tuner’s craft-sensibility (cobblestones shiver, dust motes tremble to notes), giving the environment a sonic, tactile identity. The recurring objects—archway, cobblestones, tuning fork—directly charge the final image when the stones answer with light and the arch hums as he departs. This world feels specific and coherent without excess exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, tactile, and tonally integrated: abyssal pressure, coral-encrusted spires, incense-thick air, statues offering unreachable memories all feel specific and lived-in. The environment meaningfully constrains options—the depth, oxygen limit, and the temple’s hush shape what Lira can do and how she perceives. The crystal vial functions as a charged micro-setting object whose properties directly affect the ending. A slight excess of lush description in places is the only thing keeping this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse prison on a jagged reef is vividly realized in selective, purposeful detail (slick walls, copper-tasting air, shattered lantern glass), and the sensory palette supports the oppressive hush. Setting is not mere backdrop: the defunct beam, the lantern room, and the reefed isolation all inform mood and plausibility of vanished prisoners. The environment directly charges the final image when the lighthouse groans back to life, reweighting the space as a site of broken silence. The only minor limitation is that physical constraints of the prison (e.g., geography of escape) rarely shape specific tactical choices on the page.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=8.8)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse and winter-cracked fields are rendered with striking, selective detail (“glass panes frosted with silver breath,” “air hummed with the scent of dormant blossoms and the faint metallic tang of old magic”). Setting and atmosphere are not mere backdrop: the greenhouse is the crucible where past and present collapse, and its physical reactions (groaning glass, sighing trees) echo the story’s emotional pressure. The orchard as locus of the original crime and of the repeated solstice visits charges the final image and constrains where and how the debt can be repaid. World rules remain suggestive but coherent for this lyric scale.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=8.7)
    The canyon labyrinth is vividly rendered and pervasive, from “ribs of a sleeping giant” to the woven-walls chamber, and it functionally guides and contains Liora’s journey. The setting isn’t a postcard; its age and carved paths are tied to memory, precedent-breaking, and the idea of being led into the loom’s chamber. Environmental details (dust, bone needle in dirt, labyrinth’s “sigh” and orchid-scented wind) evolve with the action and strongly charge the final image. The place constrains and enables choice, though it stops short of imposing more concrete physical peril.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the catacomb orchard, roots coiling around skeletal fingers, incense ghosts, and bone mosaics all create a rich, coherent atmosphere. Details are filtered through his sensibility, and the environment interacts with the action: roots guide his wandering and later physically bloom when the sundial is activated, charging the final image. The world’s rules (bones as mosaic, frescoes animating) feel internally consistent within a mythic register. A slight bias toward visual/lyric description over tactile constraint keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=8.2)
    The golden arcade is rendered with vivid, purposeful detail (flickering neon, polished floors, vintage cabinets, dawn light) that establishes atmosphere and tone. Elias’s perceptions are filtered through nostalgia and his attraction to relics, which deepens character as well as place. The setting meaningfully charges the clue “where the golden light begins” and the final image, though it doesn’t heavily constrain tactical options beyond being the obvious meeting site. Sensory richness and world-coherence are strong without tipping into museum-tour description.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt observatory, autumn leaves, and smell of parchment and smoke create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that suits the story’s quiet, conspiratorial mood. The eternal candle and star-maps are well-integrated objects, with the candle returning in the final image to charge the sense of enduring truth. The environment shapes the situation in a soft way (isolation of the observatory, dome as gathering point) but doesn’t strongly constrain choices on the page. Still, the setting feels particular rather than generic and supports both tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mangrove labyrinth, singing spirits, slick boardwalk, and condensation-messages form an integrated, atmospheric setting that constantly mirrors and pressures Liora’s inner state. Physical details (gnarled roots like drowning fingers, warm shard, dripping leaves) are vivid and selective rather than touristic. The environment actively shapes options and images at the end—the spirits’ song, the roots “making room,” and the shard’s glow charge the final moment with spatial and emotional reconfiguration. This is very close to top-tier scene-setting, just shy of utterly singular.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: damp stone, antiseptic, mist, and the balustraded atrium create a liminal war-hospital space that feels tangible and tonally precise. Details are filtered through Lena’s state (drug-softened edges, cold marble, the boy below), and the vertical distance plus mist directly stage their connection as something tenuous and almost otherworldly. The coral fragment functions as micro-setting as well as object, charging the final image and constraining how she understands what’s happening. The environment shapes mood more than hard tactical choices, but it does so with exceptional specificity and economy.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.5)
    The ruined orchard district, thick fog, skeletal trees, and crumbling cider house are vividly rendered and tightly bound to the themes of decay, memory, and light. The environment (fog density, slant of light, ruins) directly shapes Liora’s tactics, especially in waiting for the right exposure and in the charged return to the wall. Sensory detail is selective and character-filtered—she notices light behavior and remnants of community rather than generic ruin-tourist description. The final image of the print on the original wall, with fog around the artists’ ankles, is powerfully charged by the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sound wave garden, scaffold, glass, and fresco are vividly specific and tightly integrated into the action rather than feeling like backdrop; the parabolic dishes tracking his breath is an excellent, character-filtered detail. The garden and cathedral architecture directly constrain and enable events (amplifying sound, cracking glass, bewitching stone), satisfying the object-as-setting criterion. Sensory detail is mostly visual and auditory, appropriately for the concept, and consistently filtered through Elias’s professional eye. This is very strong, though one more tactile or bodily constraint at the end could have pushed it into truly immersive territory.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse and monitored gardens are vivid, specific, and integral: orchids in spirals, vines as runes, bees in sequences clearly prefigure the transmission scheme. Setting rules (thought tax, soil tested for “subversive growth”) are folded into action rather than dumped, making the world feel lived-in. The environment directly informs tactics and stakes—only because Elias’s greenhouse is already a kind of language can it become the transmitter. The recurring image of warped plant patterns charging the final paragraph solidly meets the “object/setting charging the end” bar.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.7)
    The gargantuan shell is a superbly realized micro-world—cathedral, camera obscura, and instrument—that shapes perception and metaphor (“words came not in lines but in spirals”). Environmental details (pinhole projections, tide’s pulse, breeze through porous walls) are tightly filtered through Elias’s attention and directly influence his emotional turns and process. The setting also charges the final image by tying the architecture of the shell to the architecture of the poem. It stops just short of literally constraining his options, which keeps it shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=8.8)
    The opal library above the clouds, the museum of extinct feelings, and the glass orchids are vividly wrought and tightly interwoven with the premise. Details are filtered through Liora’s sensibility (e.g., petals as “prismatic whispers,” the metallic scent, the hum of unspeakable emotions). The environment meaningfully charges the final image: the library’s “endless hum” and an orchid chiming in response to the tube’s note literalize the idea of archived names as sound. While the setting doesn’t strictly constrain tactical choices, it is inseparable from the story’s logic and emotional effect.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.2)
    The archive is vivid and purposeful: “mausoleum of extinct syllables,” falling books, and the death-site of the last speaker all charge the space with history and risk. The glass ink well functions as a micro-setting object that shapes the magical rules and culminates in the shattering and lingering essence that literally changes how she writes at the end. Environmental details are economical yet atmospheric, aligned with Elara’s professional gaze. The setting could constrain her physically a bit more, but as a conceptual and tonal environment it works strongly.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.5)
    The dormant-volcano amphitheater is vivid and specific: carved stone benches, breathing rock, subterranean springs as the volcano’s “voice.” Setting details are filtered through Mira’s expertise, tying environment directly to the mechanical stakes of the floodgates. The breathing, straining mountain meaningfully colors her choices and charges the final sense of approval and “dancing” between past and present. A slightly stronger sense of physical risk from the volcano itself could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.5)
    The attic and bookshop are vividly realized: warped floorboards, skylight dust, hidden ledgers, and first editions all feel tactile and lived-in. Details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility—he treats spines like braille and dust motes like star maps—which deepens both setting and character. Recurring objects (dust motes, attic as crossroads, meteorite chip) return at the end to charge the final image. The environment doesn’t constrain physical options much, but it strongly shapes mood and thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drifting prism terrace is vividly rendered and constantly present, with glass, wood grain, light, and movement all filtered through Elias’s perception. Environmental details evolve (tilting glass, spinning prism, straightened grain) and mirror internal shifts without feeling like blunt allegory. The terrace and its objects charge the final image—especially the bench grain running straight and the prism set down—making the setting integral to the closure. Sensory detail is mostly visual but used with precision and thematic purpose.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=7.8)
    The underwater research facility and bioluminescent city are vividly rendered, with strong atmospheric details like algae-lit corridors and the observation dome with fireflies mirroring the depths. The environment participates in meaning—the living city’s light “embracing” Elias and the feather’s glow mapping a path—but less so in hard constraints on movement or tactics. World rules are consistent enough, if somewhat high-level. A bit more tactile interaction with the underwater conditions (pressure, mechanics, risk) would strengthen the sense of place as an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.0)
    The iridescent cave and crystal geode are vividly rendered and integrated with mood: refracted bioluminescent light, humming crystal walls, and the cave’s responsive shimmer all mirror Liora’s work with emotion. The environment shapes the story’s movement—narrowing tunnel, thicker air, final dome—though it rarely constrains concrete choices beyond “go deeper or turn back.” The recurring objects-as-setting (crater glass, single seed) are anchored spatially within the cave and help charge the final image. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are strong, if a bit more aesthetic than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.4)
    The tidal arcade is vivid and specific, with the stars reflecting in water, damp planks, and abandoned stalls all integrated into action (her crouching, splashing, lantern arcs). Environment subtly shapes choices and tone: the “between acts” emptiness enables this private, experimental performance, and the water receives the bishop and mirrors the sky, charging the final sense of the arcade “alive again.” This is one of the story’s strongest craft areas, though the setting stops short of imposing hard constraints beyond mood and staging.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.3)
    The twilight garden and sea-salted air, alongside the shifting constellations on the man’s skin, create a richly atmospheric, lived-in setting that clearly orients who/where/when. Environmental details are filtered through Liora’s sensibility—tides, gaps between stars, the breathing cosmos—and this pattern recurs meaningfully when she “pulls” tides from the sky into his skin. The garden under stars is not merely decorative: it’s a secluded, liminal space that makes their illegal act plausible and charges the final image of shared exile in the wind and distant storms. A slight increase in how the physical constraints of the space shape tactics (e.g., concealment, danger) could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.2)
    The harbor, cold dawn, mist, and especially the prism atrium are vividly realized and strongly atmospheric. Details like cracked ledgers, glass humming with light, and spectral shards feel filtered through a glazier’s eye and reinforce the light/pattern motif. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain action, but it does charge the central ritual and ending insight. Overall, setting is a major strength and feels integral rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.2)
    The moonlit ridge, scars in cool air, scent of pine and rain, and distant thunder create a vivid, continuous atmosphere filtered through a firefighter’s sensibility. The environment mirrors the thematic tension between danger and quiet, especially as celestial bodies "hold their breath" during the key conversation. However, the setting mostly frames mood rather than constraining tactics or forcing specific choices. The porcelain box as an object-as-setting element helps charge the scene, but the ridge itself could press on the action more directly.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.0)
    The grotto is vividly realized—bioluminescent quartz, tide-polished stone, hanging shells and sea glass—and those details are filtered through Elara’s math-inflected gaze. Setting and objects (especially the decorated ceiling and shifting light) meaningfully color the mood and support the idea of patterned realities. However, the environment rarely constrains options or tactics; it mainly frames and amplifies interiority. It’s lush and purposeful but functions more as atmosphere than as a hard constraint on choice.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ivy-veiled passage, warm stone, humming walls, and glowing symbols create a vivid, coherent environment that feels alive and integrated with the premise. Setting details are filtered through Elias’s attention and profession, and the walls’ “memory” directly charges the final image of the living map. Sensory specificity is strong without devolving into list-like description, and the corridor’s physical traits (low ceiling, ivy, blackened leaves) mirror the latent danger. The environment doesn’t quite force a tactical choice, but it thoroughly shapes mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.4)
    The terrace, wet stone, jasmine, fading light, and bells create a vivid, coherent micro-world that’s inseparable from the story’s mood. Details like the “prism parapet” and echoing lullabies are filtered clearly through Liora’s sensibility and recur meaningfully in the closing image. The environment does influence timing (the mirage appears only at this liminal hour on this terrace) but doesn’t quite constrain tactical choice beyond that. Still, as atmosphere and thematic container, the setting is rich and precise.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.4)
    The Temple terrace, jasmine-thick midsummer air, cicadas, and the Twin Moons/Jupiter-Venus alignment create a strong, coherent atmosphere that feels lived-in rather than touristic. Details are filtered through Liora’s focus on ritual and history (worn stone, names of the dead, first truce site), which grounds theme in place. The monks’ chants and the alignment actively charge the final image, framing their choice as part of a long ritual continuum. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it meaningfully reweights the emotional and symbolic stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.6)
    The salt flat, dried riverbeds, and unbreaking thunder are richly realized and inseparable from the premise. Environment is not just backdrop: the diverted rivers, growing flats, and mapped cracks define his tactics and the final image of the egg as the landscape is poised to change. Weather and geography are consistent and thematically tuned to drought, extinction, and return. The setting’s specificity and recurrence also charge the closure, where the returning water will erase both salt and his visible legacy.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=7.9)
    The silver courtyard, snow, and prism sanctuary are vividly rendered, with strong visual texture (frozen surface “like shattered glass,” crystalline walls fracturing starlight). Setting is consistently filtered through Liora’s ritualized perception, so atmosphere and world-building feel integrated rather than touristic. The final image of the courtyard gleaming like a mirror effectively charges the ending, echoing her internal shift. Still, the environment mostly supports tone rather than constraining her choices, which keeps it just short of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.5)
    The radar dome and coastal environment are vivid and thematically loaded: “forgotten god,” “meteor hush,” and the sound-swallowing architecture all mirror her project of listening and retelling. The candle, shadows, and story stick function as micro-setting elements that shape how the performance unfolds and charge the final image when she sets the stick down. Details are selective and filtered through her artistic sensibility rather than touristic listing. The dome’s prior function—listening for enemies—reweights the ending by turning that apparatus toward introspection and ethics.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.3)
    The grotto above the clouds, the mist, moss, reeds, and ferns all feel vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Liora’s perception. The environment is not mere backdrop: its suspended, liminal quality mirrors the theme of transient rooting and migration, and the physical features (stones, saplings, reeds) become her signaling tools. The recurring interplay of light, mist, and organic decay supports the mood and charges the final sense of having sent a signal into a vast, indifferent world. While the setting rarely constrains options in a hard way, it deeply inflects tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.3)
    The icebound sanctum and aurora are vivid, specific, and consistently threaded—“emerald veins pulsing” over a domed ceiling that almost functions like a listening deity. Setting details (frost-stiff rope, breath curling in the cold, ice “sighing”) are filtered through Elias’s craft and emotional state rather than feeling like a neutral postcard. The environment charges the final image—the aurora “in approval,” the sanctum’s sigh, the glow that lingers as he leaves—which helps carry the thematic weight of benediction and preserved memory. It doesn’t strictly constrain his choices in a tactical sense, but it strongly shapes tone and the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=8.0)
    The vine-draped bunker, rewilded forest, and storm are vividly rendered and tonally cohesive, with strong sensory specificity (“ribs of some great, slumbering beast,” “eyes like polished river stones”). Environment participates in a light way—the vines “guide,” the storm brackets the movement, the oak hides the door—but rarely forces hard tactical choices. Still, the recurring physical spaces (bunker/forest/oak room) mirror the thematic movement from preservation to living path effectively. The setting feels particular and inhabited rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.6)
    The Ishtar Palace is richly evoked through selective, sensory detail (lapis lazuli tiles, myrrh, cedar oil, cracked urns), and it feels both historically grounded and mythically heightened. Setting is not mere backdrop: the unclaimed throne room, the oculus, and the “between regimes” limbo all shape what’s possible and when, and the final mirror-vision of a restored palace directly charges the last image. Environmental details are well-filtered through an astronomer’s perspective, with attention to stars, patterns, and time. This atmosphere meaningfully supports the theme of continuity beyond dynastic collapse.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.2)
    The Soundless Sanctuary is vivid and purposeful, from breathing walls and tilting floors to mist and silence, and its rules (erasing past, restoring objects) are dramatized rather than explained. Environmental strangeness mirrors the instability of memory and resentment and culminates in the sanctuary “humming in agreement,” directly charging the final image. The setting constrains meaning more than physical tactics, but its magic crucially enables the pin’s restoration and the erasure of Veyra’s memory. Overall, specificity and integration are strong, though an added moment where the sanctuary’s shifting physically complicates a choice could push this higher.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ruined orchard, thick fog, twilight frost, and glass mountain of forgotten things are vivid and specific, filtered clearly through the mirror maker’s attention. Environment is not just decorative: the fog parts to form a path, thickens around his ankles, and finally recedes to reveal the orchard’s bones, while the glass mountain materially shapes the central task. The rules of this liminal world feel internally consistent and are learned through action rather than dump. The only ceiling here is that, while richly atmospheric, the setting constrains choice more softly than it could at the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard-cathedral setting is vivid, specific, and strongly filtered through Liora’s perception—the mossed pews, bees, and peach-blossom-laden rafters are memorable and coherent. Environment and recurring objects do real work: the trees’ origin-story dovetails with the caretakers’ vows, and the peach at the end charges the closing image. While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain physical options, it meaningfully frames the thematic stakes (deciduous vows, persistence, hunger/forgetting). The integration is excellent but slightly more atmospheric than tactically constraining, which keeps it just short of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.3)
    The astral orchard and lonely asteroid are vividly drawn and filtered through her curatorial gaze, giving the piece a distinct atmosphere. World rules (blossoms humming, fruit ripening in reverse, trees remembering futures) are consistent and thematically aligned with nonlinear inheritance. Setting meaningfully charges the final image as the orchard physically responds to her contact with the shell, though this pressure is symbolic rather than constraining her in concrete tactical ways. Detail density is high but mostly purposeful; it supports mood and concept rather than feeling touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.2)
    The mountain bookstore, shifting shelves, and the “veins of the mountain” library are vividly realized and strongly filtered through Elara’s sensibility. Environmental specifics (scent of paper, rearranging stacks, bone of the earth) create a coherent, atmospheric space that shapes how they must move—by feel and reading, not straight lines. The setting conceptually charges the final image (the library as the mountain’s heart and as a locus of buried mistakes and disappeared people). It could constrain concrete tactical choices a bit more, but it’s still a major asset.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    The abandoned carnival ship, fog, and funhouse interiors are vivid, specific, and closely tied to the memory/identity theme. Details like the rusted hull, warped mirrors, extinguished fireflies, and the ledger of names are purposeful and never feel like tourist cataloguing. The setting recurs meaningfully in the final image (the *Mariposa* drifting alone again, fog swallowing them) and charges the sense of limbo. It rarely constrains concrete tactics, though, keeping this just shy of exceptional.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    The mechanism room, the clock tower, and the tactile objects (rope, seal, gears, vanishing door) create a strong, coherent atmosphere that suits the premise. Details like the smell of oil and parchment, the rope disappearing into shadows, and the gears responding to her actions are specific and integrated into the story’s workings rather than pasted on. The clock’s midnight chime and the door’s disappearance charge the final image and frame the temporal and institutional stakes. The environment could constrain her options a bit more directly under pressure, but it already does significant thematic and structural work.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.5)
    The harmonic caves are vividly realized—sound, light, and ice are tightly integrated into both atmosphere and action (“weaving [light] through the cracks in the ice” to reveal the passage). The environment actively constrains options: shifting ice, warped passages, and acoustic pressures all shape how Ryn moves and what she risks. The echo stone and the bloom of hush function as charged micro-settings or tools that meaningfully alter choices and strongly color the final image of her on the glacier. This is one of the story’s most fully realized strengths, with purposeful detail rather than decorative description.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting work is vivid and specific—the glass humming pavilion, salt flats, alkali crust, drifting constellations—creating a strong atmosphere that supports theme. Details are filtered through Elias’s vocation and loneliness, which keeps them purposeful rather than touristic. The pavilion and environment subtly charge the action (its song changing with the prism, its hum softening as he leaves) but rarely constrain concrete choices. This is richly drawn and tonally integrated, though the environment could press more directly on tactics to reach the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the stormlit observatory, crystal forecourt, and solid fog bridge are sensorially rich and consistently filtered through Elara’s perceptions. Environment is not mere backdrop: the crystals whisper, react to her conjecture, and crescendo at the climax, while the fog bridge explicitly structures her final option. World rules (solid fog, memory-echo stones) feel coherent and are learned in action rather than dumped. The final image of her walking away across the murmuring forecourt under a deepening storm hush feels inseparable from this environment.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the “blooming fortress” with stone petals, the damp earth, the brittle torches, and the starless night all work together to build mood and constrain action. Environmental features matter—she must ignite the torches, the fortress “blooms” in response, and the final lantern-like glow in a dark world charges the ending. Details are filtered through her craft and state of mind rather than reading as a tourist catalog. The environment clearly charges the final image and shapes what’s possible, justifying a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.3)
    The grotto and tidal pool are sensuously rendered and strongly filtered through Liora’s perceptual bias—barnacles, anemones, salt lace. The setting amplifies theme by being explicitly a “place of transition periods” and functions as a liminal refuge where the key act occurs, though it rarely constrains concrete tactics beyond offering privacy and the pool as laboratory. Its atmospheric charge is excellent, but its influence on specific choices could be a touch more materially felt.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is a major strength: the bunker’s “ribs,” the trellis’s spongy vines, and the inverted sky build a tactile, coherent world filtered through Liora’s sensibility. Environmental rules (gravity inversion, spontaneous trellis) are clear enough and consistently applied, with the swaying structure and limited time meaningfully constraining her choices. Sensory detail is vivid but selective—especially the synesthetic “taste” of silences—and supports both atmosphere and character. The recurring objects (trellis, doll, clouds as ceiling) all charge the final stance, where bunker vs. trellis vs. girl form a legible constellation.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.4)
    The prism terrace, floating lanterns, and water that fractures light create a vivid, integrated environment that feels unique and lived in. Setting details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility (noise-monitoring, storm glass, attention to pressure changes), so atmosphere supports character and theme rather than becoming a tourist catalog. The terrace’s prismatic flicker reacting to her tension and deepening into twilight at the end nicely mirror the emotional arc. However, the environment rarely constrains concrete choices; it charges mood and meaning more than tactics, which keeps this just below the highest tier.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“kaleidoscopic waterfall,” “silver-leafed trees, their fruit pulsing with an inner light,” layered murals—anchoring place and tone strongly. Environmental features are not just decorative: the waterfall conceals the orchard, the trees contain both the staircase and the hidden maps, and the living-wood throne’s roots emphasize ongoing connection and burden. Details are filtered through Veyra’s focused, professional gaze, keeping the description purposeful. The environment also charges the final image of dawn in the orchard as a threshold into a new era.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=7.4)
    The ashen sanctuary, cracked roof, and starlight “like silver dust” create a strong, coherent atmosphere that matches the emotional stakes. The doorknocker, runes, and “edge of the world” location are specific and recur in charged ways, especially as the ring clatters and glows with the child’s breaths. Setting mostly operates symbolically rather than as a concrete constraint on options. Nonetheless, it clearly charges the final image and is far from a generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=7.8)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm and mycelial tunnels are vivid, sensory, and integrated into action rather than feeling like a backdrop, especially in the opening and coordinate sequence. The recurring underground damp, glow, and spiraling mushrooms sustain a coherent atmosphere that supports the uncanny premise. The bolt and porthole function as a micro-setting that directly shapes the choice. The environment could constrain tactics slightly more (e.g., physical difficulty or risk) to push this into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sepia reading room, golden shadows, and precarious bridge are vividly rendered and strongly filtered through Elias’s attention, giving the archives a lived-in, quasi-mystical presence. The environment meaningfully shapes the magic: the bridge hums, the shadows ripple and coalesce, and the room becomes the medium for the standing waves and revelation. The archives’ atmosphere as a “living thing” is economically but effectively established. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical tactics, it clearly charges the final images.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.0)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse and its endless night are vivid, specific, and tonally precise, with details like silver-leafed vines and pulsing fruit integrated into action and transformation (“branches twisting into new, impossible geometries”). The setting meaningfully charges the final image as orchard light swallows Aldric and visually embodies the thinning of reality. However, the environment mostly frames and echoes mood rather than constraining tactics or offering concrete obstacles/resources. It’s strong, atmospheric worldbuilding that stops just short of shaping choice.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.5)
    The file room is vivid and sensorial—“yellowed paper and old glue,” dust-darkened edges, worn embossing—and strongly colored by Elias’s perception. The boarding house and vineyard are sketched more lightly, functioning mostly as waypoints rather than immersive environments. The button acts as a micro-setting object that meaningfully charges the final image. Setting enriches mood and theme, though it rarely constrains action or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.5)
    The auric lagoon, puddles, tunnel, and server chamber are vividly rendered and tightly integrated with action—the puddle reflections literally function as a map, and the underground infrastructure grounds the abstract idea of “revised histories” in a physical machine. The closing return to the lagoon’s glow and city puddles recharges earlier imagery and helps charge the final image with a sense of new paths opening. Setting is more than backdrop; it shapes access and encodes the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid, tactile, and integrated with mood: prism atrium, fractured stained glass, bioluminescent moss, and mist all feel specific and filtered through a musician’s gaze. The grotto and its light are not mere backdrop; they charge the ritual space and the final image (the atrium’s glow fading as he returns). Weather and environment (fog, mist, dewdrops) echo the story’s concern with hush and dissolution, reinforcing theme. The setting lightly constrains action (this hidden grotto as the only place where this can occur), though it could exert more direct practical pressure to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ashen skyborne arbor is vividly and consistently rendered, with falling leaves, roots, and monuments all integrated into action. Setting is not postcard-like; it directly shapes the premise (decoding the leaves), the dream sequence, and the final charged image of Liora beneath the branches. Small physical specifics—moss-stained hands, vines in her hair, monuments dotting the roots—enrich atmosphere without clutter. The environment clearly charges the final image and functions as the story’s governing presence.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.0)
    Setting is a notable strength: the oily workshop, rusted greenhouse, subterranean waterfall, and clockwork city are vivid and sensorially grounded. Details like “mist curling into the cracks of the world above” and “figures who moved like clockwork” feel integrated with Elias’s tinkerer perspective. The environment meaningfully shapes action at key moments—the trapdoor, the waterfall as gate, the city’s frozen rhythm reacting to the clock. Some images lean toward atmospheric flourish rather than constraint, but the recurring spaces and objects do charge the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.8)
    The rain-washed foundry is vividly rendered through selective, sensory detail—“soot-streaked bricks,” “damp iron and old charcoal,” “whisper of water through cracked pipes”—all filtered through Liora’s attention. The space is coherent and feels lived-in, with the anvil, tunnels, and workbench providing clear spatial anchors. While the setting strongly supports mood and theme, it only lightly constrains action; Liora’s choices aren’t significantly shaped by the environment beyond its labyrinthine implication. Still, the foundry’s decayed industrial atmosphere resonates effectively with the story’s concern with scars, failure, and repair.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.9)
    Echo Gorge, the whispering cliffs, damp wind, and the misaligned harp create a vivid, unified atmosphere that strongly colors every beat. Details like faces in the walls and the “hidden sunrise” feel particular rather than generic. The setting mainly shapes tone and metaphoric logic rather than constraining physical choice, which keeps it from the very top tier. Still, the gorge and sunrise clearly charge the final image of him stepping into dawn with laughter in his hand.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ultraviolet forest is vivid and sensorial—ozone, metallic blood smell, pulsing violet trees whose leaves absorb light—anchoring tone and world rules quickly. Setting is filtered through Elias’s altered body and trauma (bark slick with resin causing phantom pain; light flickering to his pulse), which deepens both character and atmosphere. The environment meaningfully participates in the climax when trees rearrange into a geometric grid and equations hang in the air, turning landscape into the visualization of his sought-after “math.” The forest is more a charged stage than an active constraint on choice, which keeps this just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.3)
    The alchemist’s market above the rooftops, the suspended stalls, and the drowned lighthouse painting are sensually rich and strongly filtered through Liora’s priorities. The environment supports tone and theme (time pooling, liminal spaces, objects that “remember”), and the fragment functions as a recurring, charged object in both middle and final images. The setting is more atmospheric than constraining—few choices are forced by physical environment—but the specificity and integration are high for this length. World rules (intuitive ships, story-laden objects) feel internally consistent without over-explanation.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.2)
    The circus ticket office is vividly evoked—peeling marquee, dust strata, cobwebs, dead fluorescent, smell of sawdust and caramel corn—and all filtered through Mira’s practical, ghost-aware eye. The environment isn’t mere backdrop; the specific history of the circus “bleeding through” the crack charges the supernatural wound. The micro-setting of dust and ceiling creates a lived-in sense of space that supports the mood and concept. It falls just short of the very top tier because the setting influences atmosphere more than it constrains concrete tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.6)
    The glass orchard library, frost maps, liquid-silver time chamber, and cloud sea are vividly imagined and tightly integrated into action. Setting is not mere backdrop: the frost functions as a tool, the glass branches audibly register the rupture, and the final single tree over clouds reweights prior images. World rules (negotiable reality, humming books) are consistent and learned through observation rather than exposition. The environment charges the final image but only lightly constrains tactical options, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    The baroque asteroid, Obsidian Archive, and temporal storm are vividly rendered with selective, poetic detail that feels cohesive and atmospheric rather than touristic. Setting is filtered through Elias’s sensibility—he notices carvings that “whispered,” the visible threads of time, mirrors as traps—so the environment reinforces theme and character. Crucially, environment and objects (storm, mirrors, shard) constrain tactics and enable the climax. A tad more sensory breadth beyond the visual could further deepen immersion, but as-is the world feels specific, lived, and functional.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=8.2)
    The resonance chamber and its brass, oil-scented, time-scarred environment are vivid and consistently filtered through a craftsman’s eye. The chamber responds physically to the chip (vibration, trembling, golden light), so setting isn’t decorative—it pressures Elias and charges the final image. Details like the twilight cloak and Hollow Quarter deepen atmosphere without overloading. The world’s larger context is sketched rather than built out, but for this length the micro-setting work is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting work is excellent: the hollowed valley, ruined factory, limestone cliffs, and subterranean lagoon all feel specific, tactile, and tonally unified. Sensory details (calcite “like frozen waves,” water “warm, almost alive,” the bruised twilight, the scent of stone remembering water) are vivid and filtered through Elias’s obsessions. Environment and objects (compass, lagoon, arch, vial) meaningfully shape his path and charge the final image. The world rules around the uncanny lagoon are left mysterious but feel internally coherent within this lyric frame.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting and atmosphere are a major strength: the storm, salt-slick archway, humming stones, and time-lit cavern with workers from different eras all feel vivid and tonally cohesive. Details are filtered through Elias’s eye as a maker, giving specificity to wood, stone, and light. The environment does exert some pressure (cliff edge, GPS fail, storm, the arch as a literal/figurative threshold), though less in terms of concrete constraint during the climax than as mood and premise. The recurring objects (arch, driftwood, turbines, slide) clearly charge the final image even if they don’t fully corner him into a hard choice.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the amber pavilion, melting snow, and cathedral interior all feel textured and lived-in. Environmental motifs—the pavilion’s honeyed glow, the etched glass, the thawing town—echo and deepen the thematic concern with liminal light and seasonal transition. The stained glass is not just backdrop; it is the mechanism of discovery and a key visual at the story’s center. The final return to the pavilion with the new flower painted under twilight shows the environment charging the closing image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.5)
    The environments—the zeppelin library, storm-battered dunes, and obsidian lagoon—are vividly rendered and integrated with mood and theme. The lagoon in particular functions as both setting and active force, constraining choices (where they can go, how they retrieve the ledgers) and charging the final image when it swallows the men. Details like brass shelves, shattered glass on the beach, and the hidden rock crevice feel selective and purposeful rather than catalogued. The zeppelin’s altitude/escape capacity could do even more tactical work, but as is, the settings clearly shape the story’s tension and resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and economical: warped wooden table, paper lanterns in a salty cove, sagging buildings, and overgrown streets all deepen mood without overloading. Details are filtered through Elias’s perspective as an alchemist of ruin and potential, so the decayed town reads as a laboratory rather than mere backdrop. The recurring lanterns, dim at first and burning steady at the end, nicely charge the final image. The environment doesn’t materially constrain tactics, though—it mostly enriches atmosphere and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ancient orchard atop the skyscraper is vividly realized and pervades the piece: roots in steel, hidden aquifers, rustling leaves, and the pomegranate all create a distinctive, atmospheric locus. Setting is not just backdrop but thematically charged—organic permanence versus urban change, sound versus silence—and the pomegranate’s fall concretely bridges environment and omen. The final image (orchard whispering, juice-stained fingers) is strongly grounded in this place, giving the closure sensory weight. What’s missing for a higher band is the environment actively constraining options, rather than mainly inflecting meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.8)
    The icebound atrium under starlight is vivid from the first line and stays active: ice “remembers,” frost ripples at her breath, and the space once was a greenhouse we briefly, powerfully glimpse. Setting is tightly integrated with theme—the frozen tomb versus remembered fecundity—and with the magic system (only place “where the air still hummed with possibility”). The recurring acorn cap functions as a micro-setting/tool that charges the final image. The environment doesn’t yet force specific tactical choices (e.g., physical constraints), but it strongly shapes mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.5)
    The sanctuary "perched on the spine of the world" with clouds like "sleeping serpents" is vivid and particular, and weather, height, and stone interact with her task in tactile ways (thin air, rattling windows, trembling flagstones). The bell, rope, and sanctuary floor function as micro-setting objects that constrain her choices and charge the final image (feeling the bell’s vibrations through her bones). Environmental details are filtered through her storm-attuned perception, keeping description purposeful rather than touristic. The worldbuilding is suggestive rather than exhaustive, but at this length it feels rich and integrated rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.7)
    The station is richly evoked—the domed roof, ozone and parchment smell, the edge-of-the-world perch—and all of it is filtered through a quasi-religious, attentive gaze. Setting and atmosphere are not postcard-like; they actively frame his vocation and the star’s arrival as sacred service in a forgotten temple. The recurring object-as-setting—the lantern glass—charges the final image and sits naturally within this environment. While the station doesn’t strictly constrain tactical options, it fundamentally shapes what “witnessing” can mean here.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “abandoned beekeeping oasis in a wasteland” is vivid and specific, with honeycomb husks, rusted frames, and skeletal trees anchoring mood and place. The stained glass bees, the hut, and the withering flower all function as charged micro-settings/objects that inflect the final image. The environment shapes his original choice of refuge (silence/solitude) and thematically mirrors the ghosts’ need for preservation. It pressures choice more symbolically than practically, but the integration of setting with tone and theme is strong.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.2)
    The emerald silo, the altered-world garage sales, and the field vision are vivid and selective, with details like poetic item tags doing double duty as worldbuilding and mechanism. Environment and recurring objects (silo, urn, tags) charge the final image of Elias writing his own label, even if they don’t heavily constrain physical choice. The time-warped setting’s rules stay internally consistent and are learned through observation rather than exposition dumps. The only shortfall is that the physical environment rarely presses on tactics; it’s more atmospheric than coercive.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lagoon after rain is vivid and specific (“sheet of hammered metal,” “tide had left its lace”) and evolves with the action, from shoreline to shallows to reflective “woven dawns.” Environment is not merely decorative: the lagoon’s ripples literally fracture and recombine the dawn, mirroring and enabling Mira’s conceptual shift about brokenness and beauty. The recurring feather-water-light triad also charges the final image of her writing by the lagoon.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and particular: “living stone pillars,” roots etching stone, moss-slick altar, fox and badger in twilight. Environment is not just backdrop; Elias’s plan to reshape pillars into a labyrinth directly exploits the orchard’s physicality. The rules of this world (grown stone, symbiosis) are conveyed through action rather than exposition, and the orchard’s memory charges the final image. A bit more sense of larger island context or physical constraints on the remodeling could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.2)
    The rainwashed tower, mossy steps, overgrown sculpture garden, and shelves of vials create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that’s tightly filtered through Elias’s perception. Setting details meaningfully echo theme—the rain “washes away the noise,” the tower as crucible, the amber as charged object—but they rarely constrain concrete choices beyond mood and path-following. Still, the environment and objects substantially charge the final image and give the piece a distinct spatial and sensory identity. This is a notable strength of the story.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid, sensorial, and strongly filtered through Elias’s attention: “scent of salt and something older,” wildflowers clawing through wood, bones of a battlefield under the jetty. The environment meaningfully charges choices: he sows seeds specifically into the cracks where wood meets water, over buried dead, and the reef’s absence is a constant negative space. The recurring jetty image (blooming, groaning, remembering) concretely charges the final lines. It’s just shy of exemplary because the physical environment influences mood and meaning more than it constrains tactics under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=7.6)
    The scrapyard settlement, cracked wasteland, and hollowed-out truck create a strong, coherent atmosphere filtered through Elias’s sensibility (“rusted carcass,” “belly of a hollowed-out transport truck”). The environment supports theme (ruin, used-up bodies/machines) and charges objects like the leaf and phonograph, even if it rarely constrains physical options. The micro-setting of the truck and the recurring leaf function effectively as “setting” at the end when he packs to leave. Stakes and closure would still read outside this exact scrapyard, so the setting feels artistically apt rather than structurally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.4)
    The observation deck, warped glass, and “temporally stretched” stars are vivid and character-filtered, with the environment clearly mirroring Elias’s temporal dislocation. The setting integrates with key objects (compass, sketches) and the final image: the deck as threshold only works because the space and its physics have been so firmly established. The time dilation functions more as mood and metaphor than as an active constraint on specific choices, which keeps this just shy of the very top band. Overall, the atmosphere is rich, specific, and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The “wrong sky,” icebound spire, frost-slick steps, and black-ice interior are vivid and tonally cohesive, and the setting’s strangeness supports the theme of wonder. Environmental details (cold, wind, altitude, humming walls) are integrated into action and mood rather than delivered as static description. The recurring objects (chess pieces, sundial lid, wrong sky) charge the atmosphere and final image. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond mood and texture, so its influence on choice remains mostly conceptual.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    The whispering gallery is vividly and economically realized—“like a vein of forgotten breath,” acoustics that make her voice alien, echoes that never die—and it is tightly linked to theme. The environment subtly pressures choices and meaning: she comes here specifically to unbind, the acoustics estrange her from her own voice, and the gallery carries their breaths “into something that would outlast them both.” The chessboard as a recurring object is integrated into the setting and charges the final image when she leaves it behind. The world’s larger frame (interregnum, bureaucrat’s ruins) is sketched just enough to feel coherent without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mountain-bookstore as “shelves of books that spiraled upward in impossible geometry” is vivid and integrated: Elias navigates it, reads its hidden heart, and its roots house the stone. The environment constrains and shapes the journey (labyrinthine corridors, veins of the mountain, roots like a second heart) rather than serving as backdrop. The final rearrangement of the labyrinth ties setting directly into closure and theme. A slightly wider sensory range beyond sight and abstract weight could push this even higher, but what’s present is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.0)
    Harkensleep’s “woven hush,” the frost, and the distant celestial thunder establish a distinctive, charged atmosphere that frames Elias’s fixation. The tapestry, village hall, and platinum mirror-door are precise micro-settings that directly host the key choice and transformation. Environmental elements return and reweight at the end (the hush “exhaled with him,” the thunder stilled), clearly charging the final image. The world’s quiet strangeness feels coherent and rule-consistent while remaining economical.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon, Bone Towers, mist, and pale spire are vividly drawn and tightly integrated with the magic of echoes and refracted words. Setting isn’t just backdrop: the towers amplify and distort speech, the shard is a tactile tool, and the spire’s etched words make the ending image feel earned and specific. The physical atmosphere (humming air, mist at her ankles, groaning towers) aligns with the emotional stakes around silence and confession. It stops just short of the very top tier because environmental constraints don’t sharply limit her choices beyond requiring speech, but they do strongly charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and integrated: the acid sea, rusted struts, and grinding gears are more than backdrop, consistently mirroring and pressuring Elias’s fear of dissolution. The workshop’s instability (tilting, stuttering gears) concretizes stakes and physically constrains the scene. Recurring objects—the statue, scars, key charm—function as micro-setting and are tightly woven into action and theme. The final image of the calmed sea and harmonized gears reweights the environment without feeling decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cave network is vividly rendered—phosphorescent algae, still pool, bioluminescent veins—and consistently filtered through Elias’s history with the place. Environment constrains and enables choices (the forked passage, the downward slope, the submerged ledge, the narrow dry tunnel). The “threshold” quality of the cave directly charges the final realization about temporary eternity. Sensory detail is rich without becoming disorienting.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse, cliffs, storm, and dawn are rendered with precise, selective detail that always tracks Elias’s priorities (vibration, light, scent, air weight). Environment tangibly constrains actions—the height of the cliff, the wind, the rain’s rhythm, and the turning lens all shape what he can do and how his experiment can manifest. The cobalt/dawn palette and the storm’s sensory texture deepen the thematic contrast between shouts and whispers without feeling over-determined. The final image of cobalt and gold sky against the enduring lighthouse light elegantly charges the thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    The signal station, dried sea, salt and rust, and starlit sky are vividly evoked and tightly filtered through Elias’s obsessions. The censer and moonlight function as micro‑setting, with the symbols pulsing and shifting in response to the environment. While the station doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it does meaningfully charge the mood and thematic frame of loss and obsolescence. The final image of him walking across cracked earth with the censer in hand feels grounded in a specific, lived-in world.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.7)
    The hanging orchard and ravine are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Mira’s perceptions, giving the piece a strong, lived-in atmosphere. The environment meaningfully shapes options: its isolation explains her safety and solitude, and the ravine/orchard “respond” when the eye is buried, charging the final image. Weather and landscape are integrated into action and emotion (“branches groaned like a living thing,” “The orchard sighed”) rather than offered as static description. The setting feels integral but could constrain tactical choices slightly more to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and purposefully selective: “opal dock,” “bruised sky,” salt-crusted glass, and alpine scent all filter through Elias’s perceptions and solitude. Environment and weather reinforce isolation and liminality, aligning with the memory-transference premise. While the dock and mist don’t overtly constrain choices, they charge the mood and make the final image of the keeper with the boutonnière feel spatially and atmospherically grounded. Strong sense of place without slipping into mere postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is vivid and purposeful, from the dust-and-ink intimacy of the map shop to the bioluminescent “blooming” cavern and the rising creek. Environmental elements meaningfully constrain and charge the choice: the seasonal cavern “exhaling” explains the flood, and the creek literally rises to his ankles as he decides. The recurring tools/objects (maps, chip, door) feel spatially coherent and rooted in place. A slightly wider sensory palette (more sound/smell in the shop) could push this even higher, but the cavern sequence is excellent.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful—cobalt moss, ember grotto, balcony above a lantern-lit city, and fireflies all contribute to a consistent, numinous atmosphere. Details are clearly filtered through the queen’s perceptions and status, especially the city “sprawled in obedient silence.” The grotto and mirror charge the final image and function as more than postcard scenery, though they rarely constrain her choices in a practical sense. Overall, atmosphere is a major strength and feels integrated rather than ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=7.9)
    The ember nexus, molten-copper light, charred cedar, and humming air create a vivid, coherent atmosphere woven naturally through action and thought. The setting is not a white room; it feels particular and charged, especially as the embers flare in the last lines. However, the environment mostly enriches mood rather than constraining options or tactics, so its influence on choice is more symbolic than structural. World rules around alchemy and the nexus remain tantalizing but lightly sketched, which works at this length but leaves some potential depth untapped.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mountain ranger cabin and surrounding wilderness are sharply rendered and atmospheric: creaking logs, scarred pine table, wind howling through eaves, and the grave in the mountain’s shadow all feel specific and lived-in. Setting and weather reinforce isolation and timelessness, and the hidden scroll under the floorboard uses the space meaningfully. The environment doesn’t yet constrain concrete tactical options (he isn’t forced into or out of a particular act by the cabin/mountain), which limits how much it can charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and thematically active: fog, hush, and the water clock’s dripping and chiming all parallel the story’s concern with time, memory, and the unspoken. The shop feels tactile and lived-in, and the clepsydra / water-clock motif smartly echoes the midwife’s tool and births over time. The final chime and lifting fog concretely charge the closing emotional shift. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, but it consistently shapes mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating rock tea platform, moss under bare feet, and storm-wracked sky are vivid and consistently filtered through Liora’s state. The “edge of the sky” and paused storms mirror the “breath between storms” thematically and temporally, and the first raindrop at the end charges the final image. The quill, parchment, and crystallizing ink function as micro-setting tools that constrain what she can attempt. It stops just short of 9+ because the physical environment, while evocative, rarely forces specific tactical choices beyond isolation and timing.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.0)
    The sheet music archive, the converted chapel, and the orchard together create a richly tactile, lived-in environment whose details are tightly filtered through Elias’s senses and profession. The archive isn’t postcard description: it provides Clara’s bottle and scores, the table for the coil, and the stained glass that inflects the dawn light at closure, while the chapel’s stone dampness mirrors his long-held grief. The orchard’s impending felling functions as a temporal and thematic backdrop, its rot and chainsaw climax charging the final image with cost and mortality. The recurring perfume bottle as a micro-setting object binds atmosphere directly to the ritual and ending.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ancient temple library and arbitration stone are vividly rendered (“shelves stretching into the dim like the ribs of a forgotten god”) and sharply tuned to mood. Setting details are tightly filtered through Elara’s purpose—dust motes, brittle pages, pulsing walls—so atmosphere feels earned rather than touristic. The stone as a spatial/functional anchor constrains her options and mediates the leap into the void, satisfying the micro-setting criterion. The final void sequence is sparser, but the remembered library and stone continue to charge that space conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.8)
    The fjord station, hydraulic pipes, gas lamp, and wavering horizon are vivid and tightly integrated into action rather than postcarded. Environmental details such as the humming walls, hissing pipes, and “barnacle on whalebone” image reinforce tone and Elias’s professional eye. The master clock and horizon behavior directly shape options and outcomes, and the final return to “fjord quiet” is charged by what has just occurred. It’s richly specific without overloading breadth, though a hair more interaction with the physical precariousness of the cliffside could deepen constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=8.4)
    The bioluminescent mushroom farm is vividly realized—“quiet wildfire,” violet and blue pulses, roots snaking through rock—and consistently filtered through Elias’s observational sensibility. Setting images recur and evolve, from individual spores to the entire farm pulsing in unison, so the environment actively charges the final image rather than serving as backdrop. The fungal network and permeable rock subtly mirror the boundary/connection theme without heavy-handed symbolism. While the setting doesn’t much constrain physical tactics, it is inseparable from the conceptual stakes and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rainwashed library, stone steps, mica-pane lanterns, and mildew-laced basement all create a strong, unified atmosphere that matches the story’s mood. Setting details are filtered through Elara’s sensibility as a gambler’s daughter and academic, so the space feels lived-in rather than generic. The lanterns and the basement archive are not just backdrop but functional constraints: they enable the burning of the numbers and house the father’s altered book. Weather is mostly tonal rather than tactical, but it frames the opening and closing beats effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.3)
    The subway utility tunnel and 1970s booth are concrete, lived-in, and tonally apt, from “damp concrete and ozone” to the “chipped yellow paint and fogged Plexiglas.” The environment supports the concept of cultivated estrangement—buried, humming with the city’s pulse but apart from it. The glass harmonica disc functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image when she presses it to her ear. The one ceiling is that the tunnel rarely constrains specific choices; it’s more atmospheric than tactical.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.6)
    The jetty, sea, twilight, and salt/sea-lavender scents create a vivid, specific atmosphere that is tightly bound to Elias’s emotional experience. The setting functions as a micro-sanctuary and crucible—“the only place where Elias could breathe”—and the recurring jetty image blooms in the final line to charge his internal shift. Environmental details (gull, lapping water, warm planks) are selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The setting shapes mood and inner choice more than physical options, but it’s deeply integrated.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    The disused, ivy-choked station is vivid and tonally apt, with tactile detail (“damp stone and old timetables,” “green waterfalls”) that supports the mood of abandonment and liminal possibility. The environment frames the Reciprocity Exchange concept and the logistician’s vanishing act, but it rarely constrains action or choices. The recurrent imagery of ivy and the platform at dusk gives the piece a strong atmospheric unity. It stops short of fully charging the final decision or options, so it’s beautifully rendered but slightly under-leveraged.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ultrasonic forest, vibrating trees, paused constellations, and glass-smooth stillpoint tree create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that strongly supports the emotional premise. Details are purposeful (e.g., sound as touch, air thickening like honey) and filtered through Liora’s sensory reality rather than generic fantasy wallpaper. The setting not only decorates but participates: the forest’s song guides her, the clearing’s painful frequency marks the climax, and the forest “sings louder” after her change. It could constrain her choices more overtly, but as a lyric container for an inward quest, it’s richly realized.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.0)
    The gravitational anomaly, plaza, dry fountain, and cats create a vivid, consistent atmosphere that feels lived-in rather than decorative. Details like the bruise-colored sky, ozone and fresh bread, and the metal nib etched with shifting symbols are evocative and filtered through Liora’s role and psyche. The environment supports theme (fluid time and memory) and mood, and the recurring pen-as-object charges the final image. Setting rarely constrains physical choice directly, which keeps this just below the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=7.8)
    The luminous harbor is vividly rendered and recurs as her refuge, backdrop for “mapping silence,” and charged final image. Details like “waters shimmering like scattered silver” and the smell of salt and rain are sensorially rich and clearly filtered through Lena’s sensibility. While the harbor doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it does thematically mirror and hold her emotional state, especially as the place she went when “no one remembered her.” The closing image of the harbor glowing brighter effectively charges the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=7.6)
    The archive’s atmosphere—“scorched parchment and old secrets,” toppled shelves, murals, mosaics, and defaced self-portraits—is vivid and tonally apt. Setting details generally come through action (examining portraits, fitting the tapestry fragment) rather than static description, which keeps momentum. The tapestry mural on the far wall meaningfully enters the final movement, but overall the environment constrains choices only lightly; physical danger or logistical limits from the ruins never truly pressure tactics. Still, the world feels specific and lived-in for the length.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lab, sound wave garden, and auric lagoon are all vividly evoked with selective, sensory detail (“ozone and old paper,” “liquid silver,” humming sculptures). Setting is integrated with action—he must escape the lab, traverse the garden, and use its central sculpture as his instrument. The lagoon and the universe’s breath explicitly charge the final image, giving the environment thematic weight. Some world rules around the lagoon’s “aliveness” stay abstract, but they’re consistently framed through Liora’s beliefs.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.2)
    The port labyrinth and storm are vividly rendered—containers "leaned like drunkards," metal humming, frost and sodium halos—and consistently filtered through Elias’s professional eye. The setting clearly shapes his skills (maps, walks) and the whisper-mythos, even if it doesn’t yet constrain a high-stakes tactical choice. World rules about whispers, geomagnetic charge, and memory-by-containers feel internally consistent and atmospheric rather than expository. The environment does charge the final image, but not quite to the level of being the explicit lever of the closing choice.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt dock after rain, the slick planks, the abandoned boathouse, and the canal all contribute a vivid, coherent micro-setting that feels lived-in and tonally right. Light, water, and shutters are integrated into action, not just backdrop, especially in the “ribbons across the dock” and “spiralingly calm arcs” that stage Maris’s craft. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, but it absolutely charges the central interactions and images. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are well above average and tightly woven with the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt library, mist, gas lamps, and grotto create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that supports the uncanny-toned world. Details like stained glass casting prismatic shadows and books trembling in the wind feel purposeful and filtered through Elias’s sensitivity. The setting strongly contributes to tone and thematic weight but doesn’t yet constrain his options in a concrete way beyond being a charged, liminal space. That keeps it just short of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=8.5)
    The settings—rain-slick docks, humming sublittoral fringe, black-sand island, coral-and-driftwood temple—are vivid, specific, and filtered through Lirien’s embodied perception. Environmental detail (whale songs, dissolving temple, whalebone lock) is tightly tied to the story’s magic and mood rather than ornamental. The recurring bone/sea imagery charges both the inciting object and the final state (whale’s song in her bones, the blank scrimshaw). While the physical environment doesn’t sharply constrain tactical options in the final beat, it consistently shapes mood and the logic of access to the island.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.8)
    The farmhouse and wind turbines are vividly sketched—“blades slicing the sky,” “mechanical mourners”—and the dried bouquet and tea things function as intimate micro-setting. Details are filtered through Elias’s grief and resistance, giving the environment emotional color rather than generic backdrop. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain physical choices, it strongly charges mood and theme, especially via the turbines’ constant groan. The world-rule of the happiness mandate feels lightly sketched but stable.

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=8.8)
    The cobalt atrium, frozen lake, and humming quartz pillars are vivid, sensorially rich, and filtered through the poet’s perception, creating a strong, numinous atmosphere. Environmental details evolve with the action—the ice crack, the change in the hum, and the shift of light at the end—and these changes reflect and charge the internal journey. The setting doesn’t tightly constrain tactical options, but it does meaningfully shape experience and the final image (melting lake, dimmed light, last hum). This is near top-tier scene-setting for short, lyrical work.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.0)
    The glassblower’s courtyard, kiln, jasmine, and spiral of potted plants are vivid and sensorially grounded, integrated through action rather than static description. The shard of glass and the responsive plants recur and meaningfully charge the final image of painting “the color of awakening.” The setting doesn’t tightly constrain what’s possible, but it thematically mirrors transformation and craft in a coherent way. Detail level is well-judged for the length and consistently filtered through Elias’s artistic sensibility.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.3)
    The laboratory of lost sounds is vividly rendered—jars of whispers, glass bells, and the miner’s lamp create a distinctive, sensorially rich environment. Details are POV-filtered through Elias’s obsession with sound and refraction, and the setting evolves: from static curiosity cabinet to an active resonant body humming back. The lamp lens as micro-setting/tool charges the final image and mediates his realization. The world’s rules stay stable and are learned through use rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=8.3)
    Setting work is vivid and purposeful: the observatory, ruined gardens, whispering library, and uncanny clock shop all mirror Elias’s stalled, haunted state. Details like “brass gears frozen mid-turn,” “books whispered if you pressed your ear to their spines,” and the artificial rosebush deepen atmosphere without feeling like a tourist catalog. The observatory and telescope materially shape the ending, enabling the final vision of Liora and the constellation. A marginal limitation is that some spaces (especially the middle locales) function more as mood-pieces than as constraints on choice, keeping this just below the top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=8.2)
    The loft with its rain-beaded skylight and workbench is vividly realized and consistently filtered through her sensibility; the rain’s rising tempo mirrors the story’s escalation. Objects-as-setting (cards, tape, phone) are integrated into her practice rather than posed as backdrop. The environment doesn’t quite constrain her options—she could mostly do this scene anywhere—but it does charge the mood and the final ring of isolation. Very little feels generic or “white room.”

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=8.6)
    The archive is richly and specifically realized—the bioluminescent moss, obsidian walls, and bronze prism pagoda create a vivid, coherent atmosphere. Crucially, the environment is not mere backdrop: the archive’s responsiveness to patterns and nostalgia actively shapes what is possible and culminates in the walls dissolving into light. Details are consistently filtered through Elara’s professional and emotional gaze, avoiding museum-tour description. The setting’s rules (responding to patterns/longing) are clear enough to charge the ending without over-explaining.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “blooming library above the clouds,” with silver-vine shelves and petals that react to his emotional state, is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility. Setting details (self-turning pages, glowing petals, trembling vines) are integrated into action and emotional beats rather than offered as static backdrop. The river stone and the shadow function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image, though they do more symbolic than logistical constraining. The world’s rules (dream recording, living library, unbound shadow) are internally consistent and learned in motion.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=8.0)
    The workshop, mist, jars, and glass roof under the stars create a vivid, coherent micro-world that mirrors his internal state of cocooned hurt and wary attention. Details are selective and purposeful (“jars of preserved specimens… cast long shadows”) and integrated with his actions rather than feeling like a tour. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain his choices, but it does charge the emotional tone and final image of isolation and renewed work. Sensory balance and POV filtering are controlled and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tower, garden, tunnel, and chamber are vividly rendered and always filtered through Elias’s sensibility, with details like “frosted” sand and “greenish glow” doing double duty as mood and world-rule signals. Environment shapes the path of action (the hidden tunnel, the sloping descent, the central pedestal) and charges the final image through the hourglasses and coffee. The plant-sleep/awakening at dawn and the groaning tower give a lived-in, rule-consistent sense of place rather than postcard backdrop. Setting is a core strength and meaningfully entwined with the story’s metaphysics.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Orpheum projection booth is richly and economically realized—celluloid and dust, dormant gears, the physicality of the reel all feel lived-in and tactile. Setting is not mere backdrop: the booth’s liminal quality justifies her presence, shapes her method, and the projector itself becomes an active agent in the climax. The idea of a “vast, echoing cavity behind the screen” elegantly extends the setting into metaphysical space. The final image—projector light casting lyrics on the wall—leans heavily and successfully on the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=8.1)
    The aurora-lit archway, cold air, and cosmic imagery are vivid, selective, and thematically integrated; the sky as a story-page is a strong recurring frame. The environment meaningfully charges the experience (she specifically comes “beneath the aurora-lit archway” as a threshold), though it doesn’t quite constrain concrete choices beyond mood and symbolism. Sensory detail skews heavily visual but fits the dreamlike, reverent tone and avoids clutter. The archway and instrument in the final image do help charge the closure, giving the setting more than postcard status.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=7.4)
    The world is vividly and economically evoked: “after the last forest burned,” the glowing dune, and the infinite shelves of the archive build a coherent, atmospheric setting. Details like “bioluminescent petals pulsing like slow heartbeats” and “the scent of ozone and old paper” are specific and purposeful. The dune and archive function more as portals and mood than as constraints on choice, but the recurring dune–clock–train triangulation effectively charges the final image. Overall, the environment feels lived-in and thematically aligned, if not yet fully weaponized as pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=7.8)
    The mechanical rainforest and the later living and hybrid forests are vividly imagined and sensorially specific (copper leaves, rusted soil, sap and rain), with the hum of insight integrating atmosphere and concept. These environments clearly reflect the internal journey from containment to wildness. However, the settings mostly mirror theme rather than constrain choices in concrete ways; they rarely force tactics or limit options. The recurring gear as object charges the final image nicely but still functions more symbolically than as a binding physical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and consistent: Veiled Ridgeway, twilight water, unseen rocks, lantern-lined cove, and “damp earth and salt” all build a liminal, atmospheric world. Details are usually filtered through mood more than urgency, yet the environment does matter—the indirect inlet, hidden rocks, reeds, and sand physicalize her passage and new footing. The lanterns and hooded figures give the cove a charged, otherworldly specificity that supports the story’s thematic concerns. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, it meaningfully charges the final image of her stepping into wet sand toward “unused courage.”

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt fortress, choking snow, rust streak, staircase, and practice room are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s attention, creating a strong, unified atmosphere. Setting motifs (fortress as “safety,” snow-muffled world, rust as crack in curation) are thematically charged and recur meaningfully. While the environment doesn’t tightly constrain physical options, it clearly frames and intensifies the stakes around institutional silence. The result is immersive and purposeful rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=8.4)
    The temple library is richly rendered—“stone arches sagging like the shoulders of an old king,” dust motes, cracked stained glass—and strongly inflected through Liora’s sensibility. The environment matters: hidden stones, secret hollows, and aged scrolls function as both obstacle and resource, making the setting integral to how the truth can be found. The atmosphere of ancient decay and quiet persistence dovetails with the theme of forgotten history. While the library sharply charges the final image, the setting could exert even more concrete constraint on her tactics to reach the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sea level monitoring station is vivid and specific—reinforced glass, humming machinery, salt and old paper, the lowest level with blinking monitors—and the ocean’s presence infuses nearly every beat. Environment and motif echo Elara’s interior rhythms and the theme of erasure/return (tides, rising sea, “periodic eternity”), and the station’s isolation justifies her solitary, archival quest. The setting doesn’t sharply constrain tactical choices beyond ambiance and access, but it strongly charges the final image of rhythmic knocking in an enclosed, tide-bound space. The balance of atmosphere and specificity is strong and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting and atmosphere are a major strength, with the “abandoned spaceport repair bay” and the overgrown stone circle rendered through tactile, filtered detail (“spilled mercury,” ozone and wildflowers). The environment does more than decorate: the stones and their hum actively shape her choices and charge the final image. The spaceport itself is slightly less involved in later action, but the fusion of derelict tech and ancient ritual grounds the world and theme effectively. Sensory detail is rich without sacrificing clarity.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=8.5)
    The volcanic hot springs are sensuously rendered (steam, sulfur, obsidian cracks) and feel lived-in as a taboo yet sacred site. The environment is not just backdrop: it houses the embryo, focuses social prohibition (Council ban), and physically reacts to the unsealing (trembling, churning water), charging the climax. The final image—Lina’s hand on warm, humming earth—is deeply tied to this specific place and its transformation. A slight constraint is that the springs rarely complicate Mira’s tactics beyond access and danger; they mostly serve as charged altar rather than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.8)
    The arboretum on a seaside cliff, the fogged glass, the terrarium, and the relentless sea create a specific, atmospheric container that consistently mirrors and pressures the emotional stakes. The orchid and glass function as micro-setting objects that literally vibrate with the drone hum and then charge the final images of endurance inside a fragile structure. Environmental details are selectively chosen and filtered through Lena’s state, avoiding tourist-catalog excess. The setting doesn’t force physical choices so much as it structures psychic ones, but it does so with clarity and power.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=8.5)
    The lighthouse library is vivid and textural—the sagging shelves, cracked spines, fog, and coffin-tight walls create a tangible, oppressive atmosphere. Crucially, the environment is not static: it tightens around him, effectively functioning as both psychological state and physical constraint, then reopens after his surrender. Objects-as-setting (portrait, tarot deck, ledger scraps) are seamlessly integrated into the space and its decay. The final image of the “vast again” library charged by what happened in its constricted phase solidifies setting as an active agent in the story’s meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=8.1)
    The wind-carved mesa encampment, faded canvas, and scavenged solar film create a vivid, textured setting that feels specific and lived in. Environmental detail tends to support tone and character (Elias sheltering in the sandstone lee, the wind howling at the end) rather than merely decorate. However, the setting doesn’t substantially constrain choices or tactics—nothing in the geography or encampment meaningfully alters what anyone can do in the crisis. World rules around eclipse/time theft are atmospheric but only loosely grounded in setting mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=8.0)
    The echoing, snow-muffled library is vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility, with the cold, humming cryogenic chambers and the Mirror of Echoes enriching both mood and worldbuilding. Weather and architecture reinforce the theme of suppressed sound and frozen truth in a way that supports the stakes. The environment lightly constrains action (cryogenic chambers as the only plausible hiding place, the Mirror as the means to glimpse Seraphine) and charges the final image with the library “sighing” as snow falls faster. Still, the setting mostly amplifies tone rather than forcing difficult tactical compromises, keeping it just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm is vivid, tactile, and filtered through Liora’s priorities, from the “twin suns” to the humid interior air against the howling wind outside. The enclosure isn’t just pretty; it functions as sanctuary and pressure cooker, literally sealing the confrontation in. Recurring objects—the roses, the soil, the dome—charge the final image of life persisting while the world burns. Sensory detail is economical yet rich, with consistent world rules (tower, airship, desert) that never distract.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: black sand, sleepwalking constellations, and especially the sound wave garden all feel original and sensorially grounded. Environmental details constrain action—the reeds’ dissonance dictates his zigzag path, their stillness marks the climax, and the garden’s emotional translation actively shapes his tactics. World rules (echoes, thin air, resonant reeds) are learned through his interaction rather than exposition dumps. The only thing holding this shy of the very top tier is that some descriptive beats verge on familiar lyrical cadences rather than pushing into utterly singular phrasing.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory above the clouds, gaslight, brass telescope, and city-constellation below are vivid and integrated into Elara’s worldview rather than feeling like touristic description. The environment functions as a constraint and amplifier: her isolation, altitude, and vantage mirror her role as observer of both stars and city, and the telescope literally inverts her “astronomer” role into surveillance of the living. The closing image of stepping from the observatory into dawn light is charged by all that prior atmospheric work. Sensory detail stays purposeful and tonally aligned with the noir-tinged, slightly archaic world.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “laboratory of lost sounds,” rusted phonographs, jars of melodies, and glitching firmware create a vivid, specific atmosphere that clearly belongs to this story. Setting is tightly bound to action: the haunted machinery and displays generate the haunting itself and corner Elias into response. The amber functions as a micro-setting object, constraining his method (crushed into ink) and charging the final image. A slightly broader sensory palette beyond visual/auditory might deepen embodiment, but what’s here is purposeful and strong.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.9)
    The grotto, tiles, lilac mist, and sand mandala are vivid, sensorially rich, and consistently filtered through Liora’s sensibility. The environment is not just decorative; the acoustics, drifting flakes, and mist actively shape what is possible and culminate in the final tile-pressed mandala image. World rules (whispering gallery, emergent hush) are introduced through action and perception rather than exposition dumps and remain internally consistent. The setting’s textures directly charge the closing beat, satisfying the “object/setting charges final image” gate.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: “sky split like broken glass,” charred cedar, damp stone, and scattered tesserae all feel tactile and specific. The plaza and shattered minaret are not mere backdrop; they embody the post-fire world she rebuilds and supply the key object (the mosaic) that drives her choice. Environmental details stay tightly filtered through Liora’s priorities and memories, keeping atmosphere rich without touristic sprawl. The recurring plaza/minaret/mosaic complex strongly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is richly realized: the hedge maze, lanterns, orchard, and season-flickering trees create a specific, atmospheric, and tonally cohesive space. The garden’s magic is bound to place—it “feeds on longing and memory,” and Elias can only perform this act here—so environment meaningfully constrains what’s possible. Sensory detail (scent of apples, silvered moonlight, shifting seasons) is well-filtered through Elias’s perception. The orchard’s evolving state during the fracture scene directly mirrors and charges the central emotional stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=8.0)
    The light painting studio is vividly evoked (ozone and burnt sugar, blacklight, phosphorescent paint) and tightly intertwined with Mara’s method—she literally uses the space and tools to externalize her somatic map. The muscovite, paints, and blacklight form a coherent micro-setting that reflects and enables the conceptual stakes. The environment doesn’t sharply constrain choice—another kind of lab might serve similarly—so it’s more enabling than pressuring. Still, the sensory specificity and integration with action are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=8.4)
    The coastal cave network is vividly realized through salt air, bioluminescent walls, fissures, and the sense of depth; it shapes mood and is the only plausible site for this encounter. Eira’s professional attention to sensory detail filters the environment in a character-specific way, and the heat-mapping device plus fossil function as micro-settings/tools within it. The final image of the warm fossil and rain-scented air shows the setting reweighted by what happened underground. The only limit is that the physical geography of the network doesn’t meaningfully constrain her choices during the climax; it serves mainly as atmospheric crucible rather than tactical pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.8)
    The “amber warehouse” beneath cliffs, the glowing window, dust, and canyon echo produce a vivid, coherent micro-world filtered through Mira’s sensibility. Objects-as-setting (warehouse, hourglass, jar, buttons) are not mere backdrop; they carry the weight of lost time, trapped sound, and deferred decisions, and the final image of the warehouse silence is strongly charged. The world’s rules are quietly fantastical but consistent and learned through concrete detail. The only ceiling here is that the cliffs/physical geography do not noticeably constrain options beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=8.8)
    Zephyr Bluff, the thawing valley, mist, and hidden door/room are vivid and specific, with details like “mist curled like smoke from a dying fire” and "snowbanks striped with the faintest lines of melted runoff" anchoring atmosphere. The environment and micro-setting (codes in snow, the ivy-buried door, the dust-and-paper interior) are meaningfully tied to action and knowledge—he literally discovers and re-enters his past through them. Seasonal and weather elements (thaw, zephyr, mist lifting) mirror and charge the internal shift without feeling purely decorative. The only reason this doesn’t move into the 9s is that the physical environment doesn’t significantly constrain tactics beyond serving as a charged threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fog-bound river, storm, ferry, and rope are vividly rendered and consistently tied to Elias’s perception and choices ("the ferry swayed beneath him"; the fog hiding then revealing the bank). Weather and environment actively constrain him and shape action—he must mend the rope in the storm and row through low visibility. The recurring physical elements (river, fog, storm, rope) charge the final image when the other bank "emerged like a revelation." This is strong, purposeful atmosphere that does work beyond being picturesque.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=8.4)
    The oasis is vividly realized—the withered lavender, hollow hives, bleached wood, and flattened smoke create a strong, specific atmosphere. Setting is filtered through Ren’s craft-trained perception (land contours mirrored in the bowl), which deepens both world and character. The environment meaningfully charges the ending: the oldest hive, brazier smoke, and bees’ absence/presence are all integral to the final image of honey. It still functions more as charged backdrop than an active constraint on choice, hence just shy of the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.8)
    The harbor, moonlight, rusted fire escape, and rooftop garden are vivid and consistent, with the water and oars’ rhythm returning to charge the final mood. Details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility (the “forgotten corner” he tries to redeem), which keeps the description from feeling touristic. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, but it does act as an emotional and thematic frame for the entire story. The recurring luminous water in the final image gives the environment tangible resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tidal library above the clouds, the crystalline domes, the obsidian shelf, and the floating, tide-like shelves create a vivid, idiosyncratic environment that feels inseparable from the story. Setting is not postcard-only: the hum through the floors steadies her, the shifting shelves and island-like books respond to her reading, and the sundial on the obsidian shelf anchors action. World rules (stone circle hum, library tides, sundial-guided selection) are consistent and learned through her behavior. The final image of the sundial’s shadow and the reconfiguring library is strongly charged by place.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lotus temple and lily pond are vivid, economically drawn anchors that shape mood and meaning, especially in the opening and closing images. The setting is not mere postcard: the pond actively reclaims the nest, carries her paper lotus, and is the site of her key choice. The mirrors in the installation and the lone final mirror function as micro-settings that directly charge the final image and reconfigure meaning. Sensory detail stays tightly filtered through Mira’s preoccupations with patterns, spirals, and reflection.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=7.5)
    The university radio station is vividly suggested through the static, glass, subsonic generator, and looming broadcast tower, all of which feel lived-in and tied to Mara’s expertise. Setting materially enables the solution—the tower and generator are not decorative but the mechanism of her counterattack. The campus outside, described as a powder keg, broadens the sense of atmosphere and stakes without muddling spatial clarity. More sensory texture or evolution of the environment during the climax could push this higher, but what’s here is purposeful and coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.6)
    The Nexus is vividly evoked—the fractured dome, iron lattice, damp stone, and organ-like hum create a strong, consistent atmosphere. Starlight and the compass function as meaningful objects that visually and conceptually charge the ending, especially the final “map” image. However, the environment mostly provides mood rather than hard constraints on movement or choice; the Nexus never quite tightens tactics beyond “eerie and empty.” World rules around the dimensional “ship” are intriguing and consistent enough for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=8.3)
    The quarry, mist, and fading daylight create a strong, coherent atmosphere that matches the tone and frames the entire scene. Concrete objects—the ribbon, sketchbook, lance—are grounded in tactile detail and recur, with the lance in particular charging the final image when it becomes part of Liora’s portrait. Weather and darkness don’t meaningfully constrain choices beyond mood, but they do deepen the sense of isolation and abandonment that mirrors the cold case. The setting feels purposeful and integrated rather than generic.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=8.4)
    The weather station on the cliff, the rusted girders, mildew-and-ozone archives, and the furnace passage are all sharply rendered and integrated with action. The environment reliably mirrors and supports mood (groaning under the “new sky,” alarms wailing as she reads). The copper nail functions as a charged micro-setting object that literally opens the hidden space and symbolically charges the final truth. The only gap keeping this below the highest band is that the storm itself pressures atmosphere more than it constrains specific choices.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=8.4)
    The mountain pullout, rusted guardrail, pixelated valley, and incoming rain create a rich, inhabited micro-setting that mirrors her interiority. Details are selective and purposeful—the rusted “lace,” ether smell of the flake, and rain “applause” all reinforce tone and theme. Environment does exert some pressure: the cliffside perch, weather shift, and obscuring mist help motivate her departure and charge the final look back. While the setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, it’s integral to mood and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned circus train is richly, concretely rendered—rust, peeling paint, vines, broken props—and the fox, rain, and lingering scents create a tactile atmosphere. Setting is tightly integrated with theme: the relics of failed ventures mirror Crimson Horizon and his father’s life, and the final image of the fox at the tree line charges Elias’s departure. The environment doesn’t heavily constrain physical options, but it does shape his psychological choices and realizations. Detail level is economical and filtered through his sensibility; nothing feels like tourist cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory is vividly evoked—“dome groaned,” “iron ribs,” brass eyepiece, clock tolling—giving a tangible, moody environment that matches the story’s cosmic/introspective register. The temple in vision feels atmospheric too, with “stones glowing faintly” and “inscriptions pulsed,” anchoring the dream-space. Details are filtered through Elias’s vocation and sensitivity, which keeps them character-specific. The setting mainly serves tone rather than constraining choices, which keeps it just shy of top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.5)
    The cursed lake and swirling orchard vortex are vivid, tactile, and consistently integrated—frost-rimed mud, fruit like “wet teeth,” and the bone-mirror water all heighten mood and stakes. The environment exerts pressure (mentor swallowed, branches bending/listening) and meaningfully shapes her tactics (where she plants the seed, her wariness at the edge). The final image of the lake as a mirror of bone that refuses to show her face but shows what she’s hidden charges both setting and theme. A bit more non-visual sensory texture (sound, temperature, smell) at the climax could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=7.8)
    The cobalt glade and the star-strewn plain are vividly rendered with strong, purposeful imagery that sustains tone and atmosphere. The glade as “last place where the old magic lingered” and the hedge’s heart supply a coherent mythic geography. Details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility rather than reading like a neutral tour. Still, the setting rarely constrains tactics or decision-making; it’s beautifully evoked but functions more as charged backdrop than an active pressure on choices.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.2)
    The catacomb orchard is vividly realized through tactile and olfactory detail (“garnled roots threading through ribs and skulls,” “wet earth and old rot”) and strongly filtered through Liora’s intent to bargain. The setting is not just backdrop: the orchard as a ledger of lives and its root-system literally reacting to the seed charges the final image and makes the environment thematically active. Details are economical and integrated with action (sigils in bark, coins in eye sockets) rather than touristic. It could constrain specific physical tactics a bit more, but it already does significant conceptual work.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.8)
    The quarry, office trailer, and pit are vividly realized (“smelled of diesel and old coffee,” “pit yawned like an open wound”), and the wind/echo valley motif meaningfully supports the “after the applause” concept. Setting is consistently filtered through Jake’s history with sound, which makes the environment feel lived-in and psychologically charged rather than generic. The quarry doesn’t heavily constrain his choices, but it strongly charges the final image and the ghost-music moment.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=8.5)
    The arbor above the clouds is vivid, specific, and tightly integrated—from metallic branches and cuneiform bark to humming currents and shifting cloud-sea below. Setting details are always filtered through Elara’s purpose (touching the script, finding the fissure, watching the clouds for signs), so the world feels lived rather than touristic. The arbor and seed become charged objects that frame the final image and theme, giving the environment real conceptual weight. It could go further by letting the environment impose more physical or logistical constraints, but as atmosphere and thematic container it’s very strong.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal atrium and its breathing sea are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s perception—moon phases, water levels, and milky glass all feel integral rather than decorative. The environment meaningfully shapes what’s possible: tides disturb shelves, water drowns lower stacks, and the creel can only depart because the atrium is literally flooded. The final image of the creel vanishing into the atrium’s dark water is charged by all the earlier environmental detail. World rules (moon-tide interplay, semi-living books) stay consistent and are learned through scene rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=8.6)
    The crystal caves and bunker are vividly rendered—quartz crunching, prismatic light, rust and ghostly perfume—creating a strong, consistent atmosphere. Setting is not mere backdrop; the latent radiance, etched metal, and crystal refractions are directly involved in how the pearl works and how the final image (“quartz that no longer felt like shards, but like seeds”) reweights the story. The environment doesn’t tightly constrain physical options, but it shapes the emotional and symbolic stakes throughout. Overall, the specificity and integration with the magic system and theme are high.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.7)
    The disused, ivy-swallowed station and the bathroom “ledger of lost souls” are vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Lena’s obsessions. The setting functions as an emotional and thematic crucible—an archive, a kind of self-imposed exile, and finally a threshold as the ivy “whispers” and she moves toward the river. Details like rusted turnstiles, peeling schedules, and smudged marker text feel purposeful rather than touristic. The environment and recurring objects (ivy, graffiti, river) charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=8.3)
    The glowing library in mist is vividly and economically rendered, with strong sensory cues (“scent of old parchment and something electric”) and a consistent, legible rule-set (aisles emerging like echoes, vanishing on hesitation). Environmental features actively shape experience rather than sit as backdrop—whispers generate aisles, mist conceals and then swallows the book, the shelves pulse and rearrange. The confidence man’s watch also functions as a micro-setting object that charges the final image. This is a well-above-average, immersive atmosphere tightly tied to the premise.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=8.6)
    The observatory, velvet dome, plants, coffee-stained table, and ice violin create a vivid, coherent micro-world that feels specific rather than generic-fantastical. Setting elements aren’t postcard-only: the windows shatter, plants physically restrain the father, and the coffee stains reconfigure to deliver closure. Details are filtered through Elara’s priorities as a researcher and seer, giving the environment a lived-in, functional quality. The piece could push one more step into how the midsummer twilight or the city’s edge materially constrains options, but as-is the setting strongly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific—“skyborne grotto,” “aurora’s shimmering curtains,” “ice and starlight”—and consistently filters through Liora’s perceptions. The environment supports the theme of thresholds (souls dissolving into the aurora, the grotto as liminal space) and charges the final image of her standing at “the edge of the world.” While the grotto doesn’t strongly constrain tactical choices, it does function as a ritual site whose properties (silence, suspended time, auroral dissolution) are inseparable from what she’s doing. The balance of sensory detail and mood is strong without devolving into pure postcard description.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting work is vivid and purposeful: the “umbral grotto hung like a bruise,” bioluminescent fungi, black pool, and “vineyard hush” all feel embodied and specific. Environment isn’t just backdrop—it shapes her life (thirty years of caretaking), provides the ritual descent, and charges the final image of vines heavy with fruit. The grotto’s history as a pilgrimage site is deftly folded in through the hairpin’s dissolution rather than info-dumping.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.5)
    The lighthouse, cliffs, wind, and dying campfire are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s perceptual bias, creating a strong, moody atmosphere. The environment mirrors internal states—the extinguished beam and the accusatory feel of the tower that later relaxes—without feeling like blunt symbolism. However, the setting minimally constrains concrete action or options; it’s more emotional backdrop than practical pressure. The recurring objects (mirror shard, chimes) effectively charge the final image even if they don’t materially alter tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the floating rock, magnetic grotto, and rippling pond are not postcard details but the mechanism by which time is read and altered. Environmental specifics (hum, glow, hovering platform, sycamore leaves) mirror and amplify the internal state, and the “space between the rings of the pond” directly charges the final image. World rules feel consistent within the lyrical speculative frame and are learned through her interaction with place. The environment meaningfully constrains possibilities—this ritual can only happen here—which justifies a high score.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=8.6)
    The canyon of echoes, towers of bone, and layered dust are vividly rendered and tightly filtered through Elias’s attention. Setting is not postcard-only: the echoes and bone towers are the very medium of navigation and the site of the hidden door, and the skimmer’s sound interacting with the walls charges the final image. The environment’s rules (sound, bone, dust, birds) stay consistent and shape how information is discovered. A bit more sense of physical risk or constraint from the environment could push this into the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=8.4)
    The icebound spire, black-glass courtyard, star-swarm sky, and liquid-light fountain create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels specific to this world. Setting and objects are meaningfully charged: the spire’s luminance and the fountain’s light reappear in the final flower, tying environment directly to closure. Weather and altitude shape the opening (numb fingers, weak magic, days of climbing) and justify why the journey feels arduous. At times the description edges toward familiar fantasy imagery rather than wholly singular, but it remains purposeful and integrated with character and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=8.0)
    The harbor, pier, rotting ladder, and skeletal SS Marigold are sharply drawn and tonally unified, with salt, dusk, and warped shelves all reinforcing decay and memory. The sunken library isn’t just a postcard; it enables the discovery of the book that reframes the world’s rules. The lantern release and the way light bends over the water tangibly charge the final image. Environment doesn’t rigidly constrain physical choice, but it meaningfully frames and deepens every important beat.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=8.2)
    The ambered observatory, glass “like insects in honey,” warped floorboards, and impossible stars create a vivid, specific atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. Setting details are consistently filtered through Elias’s preoccupations: observatory, speakers, and coins are all instruments of divination/listening. The environment doesn’t strictly constrain physical choices, but it heavily charges the final image (fogged glass, flickering stars, fist full of coins). World rules around the post-contraction universe are sketched efficiently and stay internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=8.7)
    The observatory at dusk is vividly realized and tightly integrated: dust, lenses, amber light, and the groaning dome all contribute to tone and to the magical mechanics of scattered light and crystallization. Setting details are filtered through Elias’s perspective as death: bones, echoes, centuries. The environment meaningfully shapes the key action (light through lenses becoming a tool), and dusk’s transition into dark underpins the emotional arc. It stops just shy of 9-band because the space doesn’t quite constrain his options beyond enabling the ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.7)
    The Sapphire Viaduct, the mist, empty rivers, and salt-tasting light create a distinctive, textured environment that is more than backdrop. The setting constrains tactics—the leaks provide the water and dripping rhythm that make his mending method possible—and its sapphire materiality charges the atmosphere and final image. World rules (magic, the bell’s history, the quiet apocalypse) feel internally consistent and are learned through action and perception, not exposition dumps. The interplay of stone, light, and water mirrors the thematic concern with silence and song without tipping into over-explicit symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and specific: the drowned town, ridgeway, junipers, submerged distillery, and “reservoir’s dark mirror” create a strong sense of place. Details are filtered through Elias’s professional and emotional stakes, especially the resurfacing streets and the lingering ghost of berries in the distillery. The environment charges the premise and ending image conceptually (a town resurfacing along with repressed histories) even if it doesn’t tightly constrain physical tactics. A touch more interaction between physical constraints (mud, darkness, water) and action could nudge this toward top-tier.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard and kaleidoscopic waterfall are vividly rendered, with strong sensory specificity (prismatic veil, hum of bees, frozen dew crystals) that feels filtered through an alchemist’s sensibility rather than a neutral camera. The frozen crystal-as-object functions as a micro-setting that directly charges the final image when it’s buried and shattered, reweighting prior description. While the environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, it coheres as a liminal, almost temple-like space whose mood shapes her decision. World rules remain consistent and are gracefully implied without exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=8.4)
    The nocturnal arbor above the clouds is vivid and atmospherically strong, with details like “cathedral of blackened branches” and city lights “like dying stars” firmly anchored in his vantage. Setting directly shapes tactics—the branches as lifeline, vine as harness, wind and groaning wood increasing risk. The parachute buckle and arbor function as micro-setting elements that constrain options and inform each move. A slightly broader sense of the world’s rules (why he’s parachuting over this city/arbor) could deepen stakes, but at this length the focus feels appropriately tight.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating rock dojo, churning clouds, and “dying sun” are vivid and tightly integrated with mood, while the altar and brain jar serve as charged micro-setting that focuses the thematic conflict. Environment constrains options—the edge and clouds make Kael’s final step physically and symbolically consequential, and the dojo’s tremor at his breakthrough mirrors internal upheaval. Sensory detail (ozone, old incense, worn grooves) is selective and purposeful rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=8.0)
    The nocturnal haven, the brook’s murmur, and the storm-born silence form a coherent, recurring atmospheric frame that colors Lena’s isolation and interiority. The escape room/blueprints workspace feels lived-in enough to ground her identity without over-exposition. The setting does modestly constrain action—she can tuck the pot by the brook, rely on remoteness to make any intrusion ominous—but it’s more mood than obstacle. Still, the final image of darkness, the room, and the brook underlines the charged poise, so environment does help charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=8.3)
    The echo chamber tunnel, leaf blower, and household at the far end are specific and atmospherically vivid, with acoustic details (“bouncing between the walls,” “swelled into something almost alive”) doing double duty as setting and theme. The micro-setting constrains tactics—he adjusts the blower’s angle, fights fuel limits, and relies on the tunnel’s shape to transform noise into something like song. The recurring pull cord and the tunnel’s acoustics both charge the final images (the blower dying, laughter echoing back). A touch more sensory breadth beyond sound (temperature, physical grit of the place) could deepen immersion further.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=8.3)
    The frozen garden and mist are vivid and sensorial, with details like "damp earth and old parchment" threading setting directly into theme. The environment meaningfully mirrors the mind-as-wound idea and the liminal, half-remembered quality of her homesickness. The garden does more atmospheric than tactical work, but it charges nearly every image and clearly shapes the story’s mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=7.6)
    The workshop, cracked stone floor, and ember nexus against a violet sky create a vivid, coherent atmosphere, and alchemical tools are used in lived-in ways. The ember nexus’s flaring in response to explosions deepens the sense of a charged environment, though it’s more an emotional echo than a constraint on choice. Setting is specific and purposeful, but it mostly supports mood rather than materially shaping tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the suspended, rusted radio-tower city over a gorge under lunar perigee is memorable and textured. Environmental forces do real work: lunar gravity warps signals and strains the city’s structure, and the tower’s collapse provides physical stakes and a charged counterpoint to Mira’s departure. Details like “old broadcasts,” “whispers of distant stars,” and the humming interpreter integrate atmosphere with action rather than feeling like a backdrop. The world rules are sketched economically yet feel coherent for the story’s scope.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=8.2)
    The spectral grotto, black water, and warped starlight are vividly rendered and filtered through Elias’s gaze, giving the piece a strong, coherent atmosphere. Details like the stars “bent like broken glass” and the “permanent transient” ferry give the environment character rather than postcard vagueness. The grotto and its star-bridge participate in the logic of the vanishing and the resolution, though they rarely constrain specific tactical choices. This is rich, selective description that feels lived-in, just shy of letting setting itself drive decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=7.8)
    The optical illusion gallery is vividly sketched—the breathing walls, impossible geometries, tilting floor, and erupting illusions create a strong, cohesive atmosphere. Environment and object-as-setting (the thread, mirrors, door) interact to drive movement and transitions rather than serving as static backdrop. Once in the void, the “space between his dreams” is more abstract, but the floating fragments of light and unwinding thread keep it from becoming pure white space. Overall, setting powerfully supports tone and concept, though it rarely constrains choice in a way that sharpens stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=8.0)
    The benthic city, abyssal plain, and observatory are vividly realized with strong, selective imagery (e.g., “corpse of coral and steel,” “bones of ancient leviathans”), and the anchor chain is nicely grounded in that environment. Details feel filtered through Lirien’s professional gaze, particularly in how currents, vents, and pressure-forged materials are noticed. However, the environment rarely constrains choice or tactics; it’s more atmospheric than operative, which keeps this from the very top tier. The recurring chain link does help charge the final image as a micro-setting/object.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=8.2)
    The atrium, mist, and former-hospital history work together to create a vivid, coherent environment that matches the supernatural premise. Details like the glass ceiling “dripped with twilight” and mist recoiling at Lena’s touch are specific and atmospheric without stalling momentum. The setting subtly shapes options by making the space liminal and disorienting, though it rarely exerts concrete tactical constraints. The environment clearly charges the final image of Lena running into deepening mist toward the dead.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.5)
    The facility and deep-sea environment are vividly realized (condensation-slick walls, undersea cables like pythons, crushing pressure), and details are tightly bound to Elias’s fear and mission. Physical constraints—flooding lower levels, pressure, narrow corridors—shape both options and atmosphere. Recurring objects (cables, codex, gold flecks) charge the final images of darkness and the facility’s last “breath.” Setting is not decorative; it actively underwrites tone and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=8.2)
    The opal observatory under snow is vivid and tonally apt, with selective sensory details (“smelled of old paper and cold metal”) that feel lived-in rather than touristic. The setting mirrors and amplifies the emotional state—a frozen, refractive space where time “moved differently”—without becoming heavy-handed symbolism. While the environment does not sharply constrain physical choices, it meaningfully charges the atmosphere and the final image of the watching stars. The micro-setting of the monitor and ink-words nicely ties the cosmic and the technical.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=8.5)
    The canyon of bone towers and the tunnel of endless echoes are vivid, tactile, and integrated into action rather than postcarded. Environmental features (hollow bone, breathing walls, amplified whispers) are precisely what make her experiment possible and charge the final silence when she exits. The flawed diamond as tool and the body-scale tunnel work as micro-setting constraints she must physically move through and manipulate. Setting is a major asset here and meaningfully charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.0)
    The underground garden is vividly realized through smell, light, texture, and the foxfire mushrooms, and it’s clearly established as a threshold rather than a decorative backdrop. The setting’s rules (air bending, hum, altered physics) stay consistent and charge the perception of every object, especially the phone and arrowhead. While the environment mostly functions atmospherically rather than as a hard physical constraint on tactics, it does meaningfully frame the stakes as stepping across/into another order of reality. The integration of herbalist tools, jars, and the improbably placed cordless phone gives the space an off-kilter, lived-in specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=8.4)
    The orchard beneath the sky-bridge, the motionless statues, and the rusted mechanical city are vivid, selective, and tonally unified, with images like “fruit that never rotted” and “streets paved with broken glass” anchoring the world. Setting meaningfully shapes choices: the statues’ perimeter, the bridge’s railing, and the physical gap to the mechanical world all constrain Liora’s options and turn her escape into an embodied risk. The environment evolves plausibly—vines erupting around statues, the city shuddering as the music spreads. A slight ding is that the mechanical city could use one more tactile detail connected directly to Liora’s body or movement to fully match the orchard’s richness.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt arcade, border town, and observatory are vividly and economically evoked; details like flickering neon, cracked linoleum, and dimming machines under the jammer all feel lived-in and specific. Setting is clearly filtered through Jace’s weary perception and supports tone and theme (a relic space for a relic job). The recurring objects—the arcade counter and bottled storm—visibly charge the final image when he tucks the bottle into his bag. The environment could constrain choices a bit more directly to nudge this into the very top tier.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: rusted train, wild grass, mist, wind bells, sawdust, and caramel all deepen atmosphere while tracking Elias’s movement through the space. The environment participates in the action—the train literally moves, the mist thickens and then parts, the carousel and circus grounds reconstitute around his choices. Details are well-filtered through the protagonist’s sensibility as a carousel carpenter. It stops short of 9-band because the setting more hosts the transformation than constrains concrete choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and original: the “scientific poetry library” with humming spines, lavender and old paper, and equations etched into a door feels sensorially and conceptually rich. Details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility (geometry, equations, analog memories), which tightens tone and worldbuilding. The environment directly shapes events—the specific nature of this library makes a hyperbolic-geometry threshold and a void of living stories feel earned rather than arbitrary. It stops short of constraining a difficult choice, but it strongly charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=8.2)
    The whispering archipelago, kapok tree library, ferries, and farthest island create a vivid, coherent space with consistent mood. Environmental features matter: the separation of islands and ferry access makes the woman’s distance and his final journey concrete. Details like the “hollowed-out trunk” and dawn over the islands feel selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain tactics beyond “he must travel by sea,” but it strongly inflects atmosphere and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=8.0)
    “The shadowed nexus under starlight” and the canopy of ancient oaks anchor place and mood with economical, evocative detail, and the star’s light as “mercury” is vivid and purposeful. The environment feels mythic and lived-in without devolving into cataloguing. That said, setting mostly charges atmosphere rather than constraining choices—the nexus and forest don’t meaningfully alter tactics beyond providing a ritual space. Strong, polished atmosphere, slightly shy of using environment as an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and specific—the sunken orchard greenhouse, algae-dimmed light, shipwrecks draped in kelp—creating a strong, eerie atmosphere. Environmental conditions affect action: wading knee-deep, shattered glass, the final rush of water that interrupts the reunion. The recurring greenhouse/orchard image meaningfully shifts from decayed curiosity to lethal threshold as the portal opens and the structure fails. While the shipwreck ring is more atmospheric than functional, the overall world feels distinct and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.4)
    The forgotten library is vividly and economically rendered—“spines split like dry lips,” cracked leather, old rain, and the high window with its trapped shadow all feel specific and lived-in. Setting elements (the library as exile-cell, the shard-mirror, the playground swing outside, the caught shadow) mirror Elara’s fractured stasis and subtly constrain her choices. The environment does more emotional than tactical work but is tightly integrated with the tone and theme. Spatial and temporal anchors remain clear throughout.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and sensorial—the waterfall whispering, the moss, the “verdant parapet,” and the mist all create a strong atmosphere. Details like the runoff-enriched soil and the mist “kissing her cheeks” are integrated into Maren’s actions and perceptions rather than feeling like a static backdrop. The environment tonally supports the sacred, liminal mood of the ritual and reappears meaningfully in the final image (“The waterfall’s mist curled around the new tree”). It still functions more as a charged altar than as a constraint that forces difficult choices, which keeps it just shy of the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=8.6)
    The prism sanctuary, stained glass, tattered net, and breathing silence are vivid and consistently filtered through Elias’s perceptions as a restorer and listener to voices. Setting elements are not mere backdrop: the sanctuary’s interlaced hush, the rafters with the net, and the physical ladder shape what Elias can do and how the pressure manifests. The environment’s behavior (silence thickening, light refracting) deepens atmosphere in tandem with stakes. This is near top-tier scene-building, though a touch more tactile interference from the environment at the climax could push it even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting and atmosphere are rich and purposeful: damp stone, rain-scoured frescoes, moss-slick stones, and the dark chapel create a cohesive, somber world. Details are filtered through Elias’s map-and-archive sensibility, which sharpens specificity (edges, tears, weathering). The recurring environments (vault frescoes vs. chapel frescoes) subtly bind locations and theme, and the child’s shoe on the altar is an excellent charged object. The environment doesn’t significantly constrain tactics beyond mood and access, which keeps it just below the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underwater library, the fractured skylight, silt “like ash from a forgotten fire,” and the groaning hull create a vivid, coherent environment that’s strongly filtered through Elias’s sensibility. The setting meaningfully constrains action (rebreather, currents, bolted desk, suspended silt) and furnishes crucial props (logs, globe, desk for the shattering act). The recurring object-as-setting—the snow globe—charges the atmosphere and becomes the fulcrum of the final image and release. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful rather than touristic, supporting a consistent, submerged melancholy.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=8.2)
    The misty courtyard above the clouds, phosphorescent graffiti, and storm-drenched sky create a vivid, specific atmosphere that feels integral to the piece’s mood. Details like the bolt plate on the cobblestones and the glowing paint are well-filtered through Elias’s perception. The environment and weather lightly pressure the timing (the coming storm, the “between lightning and thunder” beat) but function more as tonal charge than hard constraint. Still, the setting and recurring objects clearly charge the final images and couldn’t be swapped out without significant loss.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=8.3)
    The icebound spire, grinding elevator, and shrine-like cabin are vivid and tightly selected, creating a strong atmospheric frame. Setting is not merely decorative: the ice, frosted glass, and angle of sunlight enable the “scattered light” method that reveals the cipher. Recurring objects (the elevator, window, glass, and model airship) echo the themes of ascent and loss without feeling over-signaled. The environment doesn’t severely constrain physical options, but it does charge the imagery and final mood.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=8.7)
    The sky gondola, skeletal airship docks, and brass fittings are vividly imagined and integrated into action, not just backdrop; they shape how Elias moves, what he can see, and what’s at stake if he steps off. The sky’s textures and cloud types are filtered through his emotional taxonomy, so setting and interiority are fused. The final image of him on the railing, wind tugging, with the earth blurred below and the vast sky above, is charged by all the prior environmental work. World rules and physical space remain consistent and legible.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tree trunk library is evocative and specific—“damp paper and time,” veined shelves, the condemned building above—all filtered through Liora’s sensibility. Setting and atmosphere strongly support the tone of charged stillness and “before-ness,” especially with dawn seeping in as she leaves. The environment lightly pressures the choices (last night before demolition) and clearly charges the final image, though it doesn’t physically constrain tactics much. Overall, the place feels lived-in, integral, and thematically aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=8.2)
    The airship, navigation chamber, lower deck, and cloud sea are rendered with vivid, selective detail (“smelled of aged paper and ozone,” the dusty hopscotch board) that feel filtered through a map apprentice’s eye. The starling murmurations and the lantern’s projected patterns meaningfully charge the atmosphere and the final image. Setting and recurring objects (airship, birds, light) support the conceptual reframe of the ship-as-compass, though they don’t strongly constrain choices. Overall, this is immersive, economical worldbuilding that enhances theme and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=7.6)
    The frozen library, hall of mirrors, and gear-strewn workbench are vivid and tonally unified, with selective concrete detail (“smelled of old parchment and the faintest hint of frost,” “hauntingly bright” gears). The hall of mirrors meaningfully shapes the story’s mechanics by providing visions that grant knowledge, not just atmospheric reflection. The environment could constrain choices more directly—Elias never has to physically work around the ice, altitude, or danger—but it does charge the final images of mirrors and moving gears. This is strong, publishable-level atmosphere that could be pushed further into true necessity.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integral: the floating rock arches, bioluminescent trees, and nebula of respite are not postcard details but entwined with how the villagers heal the orchard (listening to arches, using nebular light). The watering bell, arches, and nebula recur and charge the final image, creating a strong sense of place-bound ritual. Environmental rules stay consistent and are learned through action (e.g., the nebula feeding the soil “only if we let it”). The only limit to an even higher score is that the environment shapes tactics gently rather than as a hard constraint under pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse, sea, and interior objects (clock, pane, puppet) are vivid and tightly filtered through Elias’s perspective, with the environment mirroring and charging his choices. The pane of hush and the lighthouse beam in particular function as micro-settings that directly shape tactics and the final image (puppet keyed into fractures; beam “not to warn, but to cradle”). Weather/time-of-day (dusk, stilled waves, held breath) are economical but effective pressure, though the physical environment constrains options more texturally than logistically.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.3)
    The cliffside orchard, stone maze, frost, and mechanical birds create a vivid, coherent environment that is both atmospheric and functional. Setting constantly constrains action: the birds’ patrols, the maze’s danger, and the cliff and cold all shape Mira’s options and tactics. Details are selective and filtered through her practical mindset rather than touristic. A touch more tactile interaction with the terrain during the chase beat could have pushed this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ravine, river, moss, and foam are vividly rendered and filtered through Lina’s sensibility, creating a strong, grounded atmosphere. Environmental details aren’t just scenic; the river’s braiding and foam patterns directly feed her insight and the final “map” image. Sensory work (wet earth, pine, damp moss) is selective and purposeful rather than touristic. The setting doesn’t physically constrain choices much, but it powerfully charges the thematic and emotional frame.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.7)
    The “glass orchard library” and cloud-sea are vivid, original, and consistently filtered through Elias’s perception, with details like humming books and prismatic skylight pulling double duty as atmosphere and theme. The environment’s mutability (fading name, appearing/disappearing things) undergirds the story’s logic about undecided realities and beginnings. The final door opening onto the swirling clouds directly charges the closing image, making the setting integral to the closure beat. World rules are fantastical but internally consistent and learned via action and perception rather than exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.2)
    The desert fortress in rare rain and the coral icebound pavilion are vividly and economically rendered, with strong sensory specificity (“salt from the storm still stinging her fingertips”). Setting is consistently filtered through Maren’s perception, linking environment and grief without feeling like a museum tour. The coral’s tidal formations and final warmth charge the ending image effectively. The physical environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactics, but it does significant thematic and atmospheric work.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The astronomical clock tower is vivid and specific enough to be felt—a looming brass face, frozen hands, dusty ledges, groaning gears—so the environment feels tangible. The cuckoo clock weight functions as a micro-setting object that both constrains action (completing the mechanism) and charges the final image. Details are well-integrated into action (scrubbing floors, oiling gears, pulling cords) rather than isolated description. A slightly broader sensory palette (sound/smell pre-gathering, physical strain of the climb) could deepen atmosphere further.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=8.2)
    The moonlit canyon and the mirror are vividly rendered and tightly integrated: the “pooled” moonlight, the canyon’s “hum,” and the fractures refracting into “jagged constellations” all feel purposeful and character-filtered. The setting effectively acts as a participant in the scene, answering in pressure instead of words and subtly approving her final choice. The environment and object together constrain tactics (angle of the mirror, locus of memory work) and charge the final image of her walking into “a path of silver and shadow.” Some sensory bandwidth is skewed to the visual, but in this mood piece that narrowness feels deliberate rather than thin.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.2)
    The grotto, bioluminescent moss, inverted gravity, and mist are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elara’s sensibility, creating a strong, unified atmosphere. The environment evolves with the action (symbols shifting, mist parting, moss flaring) and supports the theme of thresholds and hidden structures. That said, the setting rarely constrains her options or forces tactical choices; it is more stage and echo chamber than active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.2)
    The siskin alder grove, the ancient sculpture, moss, and porcelain insulator are vividly rendered and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensory-musical bias. The environment supports the tone (pressed, humming silence) and charges the final image of the grove no longer silent. The grove doesn’t strongly constrain choices beyond providing these artifacts, but the recurring objects (sculpture, insulator, hedgehog) function as micro-setting anchors that matter to the ending. Overall, atmosphere and specificity are strong without becoming a static postcard.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.8)
    The magnetic nexus, dusk light, and humming stones are vivid and atmospheric, with a consistent sensory palette (light, vibration, uneven gravity) that suits the subject. Details like the “polished basalt worry stone” and the stones’ heartbeat-like glow are selective and purposeful, anchoring both mood and theme. The environment shapes what is possible (reading patterns, feeling currents) but only lightly constrains choices; it’s more stage and instrument than obstacle. Still, the setting clearly charges the final images and contributes significantly to tone.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.0)
    The workshop, with solder smell, lantern light, and star-latticed roof, is vivid and integrated into action (bench, tools, clasp). The Arctic and its "vast" quiet expand the atmosphere in a way that’s thematically aligned rather than expository. The setting contributes to tone and the final image, especially in the contrast between the workshop’s hush and the fireworks outside, though it doesn’t strongly constrain tactics. Overall, specificity and sensory detail are strong and purposeful without becoming museum-tour description.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=7.8)
    The treetop village, moss-lined balcony, swaying bridges, and distant ocean create a vivid, coherent atmosphere filtered through Mira’s sensibilities, especially smell. The setting’s motion/vertigo subtly echoes the theme of stillness within movement. However, the environment rarely constrains or enables choices; it’s more backdrop than active pressure. Strong descriptive work, but it doesn’t quite charge the final image in a way that would elevate it into the highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=8.5)
    The orchard planet with floating arches, silver-leafed trees, and liquid-silver waterways is vividly rendered and consistently filtered through a pilot’s attention. Gravity inversion, arches, and waterways actively constrain navigation and shape what’s possible, not just as backdrop but as operating rules (e.g., navigating by water flow, fruit shattering on undersides). The final image of seeds drifting upward like stars elegantly fuses setting physics with thematic closure. A slight underuse of environmental danger undercuts full 9-band potential, but the specificity and integration are strong.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.6)
    The port’s container labyrinth is vividly rendered and strongly integrated with pressure: its shifting geometry literally traps Elias and embodies the city’s new “logic.” Sensory details (groans, wind, salt, rust, unstable stacks) feel filtered through his technical mindset and escalating fear. Crucially, the setting constrains his options and charges the final image of the wind howling through sealing gaps. This is a major strength and would be hard to transpose to another environment without rewriting the story’s core.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.4)
    The ice cavern and aurora are vividly rendered and tightly bound to the action: the ice hums and vibrates with the music, and the aurora’s colors literally shape her method. Environmental details (shimmering ice, “breath of the wind,” ribbons of green and violet) are filtered through her synesthetic perception, avoiding generic scenery. The setting constrains the story’s logic—the need for hush in this resonant cavern and the visible aurora overhead are prerequisites for her attempt. The final image of the aurora cradling her and the cavern painted in new colors gives the place an earned, charged transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.0)
    Setting and atmosphere are vivid and purposeful: the Thunder-echo Range, the avalanching silence, the cavern’s smell of “something older” all anchor mood and world without excess exposition. The other side’s twisted light and suffocating silence nicely mirror and escalate the canyon’s hush, giving the environment a conceptual role in the theme of boundaries and breath. The flute and driftwood function as micro-setting elements that shape movement and options. The main limit at this length is that the big-named setting (Thunder-echo Range) doesn’t constrict action as much as it frames tone.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is richly particular and tonally integrated: the topaz-glass dome, refracted dying starlight, and glass floor all feed the cosmic-mechanical mood. Environmental details like the vanishing stars and halo fragment charge the final image of darkness and lingering equations, giving the place conceptual weight. World rules (halo humming, ink turning equations “alive”) are consistent enough to feel intentional, not arbitrary spectacle. The space rarely constrains tactics in a literal sense, but it frames and amplifies the stakes effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=7.8)
    The aurora-lit ridgeway and the pendant’s physicality create a strong, coherent atmosphere; details like “scent of ozone and old stone” and the cloak woven from aurora light feel purposeful rather than decorative. Setting evolves with the pressure—the ridgeway “breathing,” the glimpse of a world beyond—mirroring the threshold theme. The environment charges the final image (auroras pulsing like a heartbeat) even if it doesn’t tightly constrain logistics. The world’s rules stay consistent and learnable through action.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=8.5)
    The quartz arbor, mist, and frost on the car window are vivid and specific, with details filtered through Elias’s mystical, pattern-seeking gaze. Setting is not just backdrop: the arbor is chosen for its residual energy, the prism engages with its light, and the melted frost at the end charges the final image as an echo of transmuted emotion. Environmental details (cold, breath, crystalline branches) consistently support tone and theme. The world rules are gently fantastical but internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.5)
    The orchard, bamboo forest, and ruined city of spires are vividly rendered with strong, selective images (“peaches ripened in silence,” “bamboo stalks stoically sparkling”). The setting is clearly anchored and tonally aligned with the story’s concerns of forgetting and unraveling. While the environment symbolically charges her departure and return, it rarely constrains concrete choices beyond framing a threshold at the forest’s edge and a desolate arrival in the city. As a result, atmosphere is excellent, but the world doesn’t quite function as an active pressure on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.2)
    The floating orchards and rock arches are vivid, specific, and central to the premise; the mines’ physical structure both creates the problem and dictates the solution. Details like the “azure haze,” howling wind through shafts, and damp, rust-scented tunnels feel sensorially alive and grounded in Elias’s expertise. The environment constrains choices (no brute force; he must enter the shaft and work delicately), and the final image of arches painted gold and blue reinforces thematic renewal. It stops short of 9-band only because the setting, while excellent, rarely pushes back in the moment-to-moment struggle; it frames more than it actively resists.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.4)
    The abandoned repair bay is vividly rendered (“smelled of ozone and rust,” “bay’s skeletal remains”) and its function as a nexus/gate is integrated into the plot rather than purely decorative. The city-of-spires vision and the mirror-lined streets expand the setting in a way that meaningfully charges the final image of the monument and scale. The spaceport doesn’t sharply constrain tactics moment to moment, but it does frame the entire choice as happening in a liminal, decaying threshold space, which supports the atmosphere and theme. Overall, setting is purposeful and specific, though not yet fully weaponized against the characters’ choices.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.8)
    The lighthouse and lantern room are vividly rendered—“bruised twilight,” “ghost of light, a luminescent ache”—and consistently filtered through Elias’s seafaring, grief-weighted perspective. The environment and recurring objects (lamp, sea glass, stacked stones) directly charge the final image; the room’s supposed haunting is reinterpreted without needing extra exposition. Spatial and atmospheric anchors are clear and economical, with no white-room moments. The setting doesn’t aggressively constrain physical options, but it strongly shapes mood and meaning.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.7)
    The emerald lighthouse and its glass lantern are richly evoked and integral to how the magic operates, not mere backdrop. Details like “bottled lightning” and “total internal reflection” feel both atmospheric and functionally tied to her method of seeing between worlds. The unborn city echoing the lighthouse’s glow effectively extends setting into a conceptual mirror that charges the ending. The only thing holding this below the very top band is that the physical environment rarely constrains her options in a tangible, tactical way; it’s more instrument than obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is richly specific and thematically fused: the floating granite slab, bamboo stilts in the river, rice-paper walls, and valley mist all echo the story’s interest in suspension, translucence, and light. The environment isn’t just decorative; it frames his observations of sun trails and becomes the site where the final shimmer happens. The tea house’s “hover between stillness and flight” pointedly mirrors his post-surgery limbo and the stories’ iridescence. While the setting doesn’t tightly constrain a tactical choice, it decisively charges the final image and internal shift.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.6)
    The tower, storm, labyrinth, and watching trees are vivid and integrated, with sensory specificity (“damp sawdust,” “moonlight—pale and precise”) filtered through Elias’s workmanlike, haunted perspective. Environment materially shapes the story—moonlight heals, the labyrinth injures and remembers, the balcony vantage enables the final map-image. The world’s rules (hungry, whispering architecture; responsive objects) are consistently implied rather than over-explained. Setting directly charges the final image of the tower as vessel and the trees’ remembering roots.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=8.3)
    The alchemical orchard greenhouse, mica windows, overripe scent, and liquid-gold fruit create a vivid, specific atmosphere that feels integral rather than decorative. Setting meaningfully charges the mechanics of magic (dawns as fruit, mica refracting their light) and reprises in the village windows glowing at the climax. Environmental details are sensibly filtered through Elara’s purpose and anxiety, keeping the world coherent. The “endless night” framing cleanly underpins the core visual contrast with the dawning light.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=7.8)
    The library is vivid and particular (“old parchment and beeswax,” impossible spirals, paradoxical volumes) and reads as a lived-in space that reflects Elias’s inner life. The setting isn’t just decorative: the hidden society library defines his constraints, and the paradox section and specific book literally provide the map that shifts his options. The city at night is sketched more lightly, but the contrast between cloistered library and paused, empty streets supports the thematic move from inwardness to risky outwardness. The environment could perhaps bear even more pressure on his choice, but it already does meaningful work.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is one of the story’s strongest assets: the frost-laced city, hollow bakery, and overgrown palace courtyard are all crisply evoked with multi-sensory detail. The tea house and garden are not just backdrop but become the locus of action and the site where seeds are planted, so environment participates in the closure image. Details consistently filter through Elias’s attention and mood, maintaining tone without sliding into cataloguing. The only thing holding this just below the highest band is that the setting constrains choice more atmospherically than practically—he could theoretically plant those seeds almost anywhere.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.5)
    The frozen library above the clouds is vividly rendered and sustained—ice, lantern glow, “quartz hush”—and the environment continually inflects perception and tone. The setting isn’t mere backdrop: the library’s physical decay and cold directly motivate Elias’s actions and charge the final image of him alone amid the hush. Objects (lantern, slide, shelves) are used as tools, not just described, and the repetition of ice and light imagery coheres thematically with luminous vows. This is a standout strength and clearly charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.2)
    The pier and pirate market are vividly rendered with concrete, sensorial detail—“salt, rust, and something older—spilled rum and broken promises” encapsulates atmosphere and theme efficiently. The environment is not mere backdrop: the rotten pier, hidden market, and constables above make quiet a real constraint and justify why a single knife fight matters. Setting is consistently filtered through Lena’s familiarity and profession-adjacent instincts. While the physical layout doesn’t tightly constrain tactical options beyond “stay in the shadows and keep things quiet,” the world feels coherent, lived-in, and tonally aligned with the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and particular: aurora “like a slow heartbeat,” forests “voting” through mycelial networks, and trees physically marching at the end create a memorable atmosphere. Details are filtered through Elara’s scientific skepticism and wonder, tying environment to character. The election hum and later migration don’t much constrain choices, but they strongly charge the final image and theme. World rules feel internally consistent and are delivered through concrete action rather than infodump.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    The subterranean crystal cave is vividly rendered (“cathedral of amethyst and quartz,” violet light) and remains central from first line to last, giving the piece a strong atmospheric spine. The contrast between the cave’s violet glow and the door’s golden light effectively charges the final image. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, it shapes tone, imagery, and the logic of lost miners as subjects of his art.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.5)
    The greenhouse city under a toxic sky, cracked domes, and the humid, decaying streets are vividly realized and integrated into action rather than treated as mere backdrop. The dried oasis and “Year of the Last Rain” conceptually charge the Last Bloom and the Echo Vault, making the final hidden stair under the preserved flower feel consequential rather than arbitrary. Environmental details (fogged domes, skeletal plants, condensation drip) consistently mirror and deepen the story’s sense of exhausted systems and archived remnants. The setting meaningfully constrains possibilities and charges the ending image.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bluff above the clouds, the humming earth, and the cold, silent village are vividly realized and consistently filtered through Elias’s sensory priorities. Weather, altitude, and wind meaningfully shape tactics (the sculpture only sings when the wind rises; winter will mute both him and his materials). Recurring objects-as-setting (the well, the iceberg shard, the toy orb) charge the final image rather than feeling decorative. The piece balances lyricism with clear spatial and atmospheric grounding, elevating the mood without losing orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.5)
    The glass-domed desert rose farm is richly evoked—artificial suns, hydroponic tubes, fire suppression, and cracking glass are all integrated into action. The environment constrains and shapes choices (the existence of the burn failsafe, the sealed dome that can crack under heat). Recurring objects (roses, box, soil) charge the final image of him kneeling in “strangely organic soil.” A slight excess of atmospheric description in calm moments is the only restraint on an even higher score.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.0)
    The courtyard at dawn, rusted mailbox, and neighboring shops are vividly sketched and give the piece a strong sense of place. Details like honey-like dawn light and flour-dusted Mrs. Hargrove feel selective and lived-in, matching Elara’s attentive temperament. However, the environment mostly sets mood rather than constraining choices or tactics; nothing about the physical space forces a particular action. The setting enriches atmosphere but doesn’t fully integrate as a structural pressure on the story’s outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sunken laboratory is vivid and tactile—rusted girders, corroded glass, bioluminescent algae, water seeping through cracks—and these details are consistently filtered through Elara’s awareness. The environment exerts pressure (the long-term sinking, the actively worsening leak, the coral-fused hatch) and directly constrains the final choice. Recurring objects (the dice, the journal, the vials) are grounded in this setting and charge the atmosphere rather than feeling decorative. A slightly stronger sense of physical jeopardy from the ocean at the end could push it higher.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.8)
    The docks, humming salt chambers, condensation-fogged glass, and jagged crystal towers create a vivid, specific world filtered through Marlowe’s workman’s eye. Environmental features meaningfully constrain and charge action—the gravity pockets and fluctuating pull slide his boots and draw him toward the room’s center, while the crystals and vats house the buried journal. Sensory detail (ozone, shell-like resonance, fogged glass) is purposeful rather than touristic, continually supporting mood and stakes. The final image of gleaming crystals refracting lantern light into “silent, searching beams” effectively fuses setting with theme.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=7.4)
    The nocturnal brook and “nocturnal haven” are vividly rendered and tonally aligned with the story’s silence theme, with good sensory layering in water, air, and earth. The setting participates in the action by carrying the wing away and by housing the “terrestrially cosmic hum,” but it doesn’t strongly constrain options beyond being a secluded ritual space. Details are selective and POV-filtered rather than touristic, maintaining atmosphere without clutter. The environment charges the final image but falls just short of feeling structurally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.6)
    The rooftop garden and meteor shower are vivid and purposeful, framing the scene and echoing the themes of transience and legacy (“dust of the stars,” the living herbs from Veyra). Setting details are selective and filtered through Elara’s grief and ritual, rather than generic description. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain choices, it does charge the final image and make this feel like it could only happen here. The world rules (language of buildings) are sketched efficiently and consistently through character belief rather than exposition dumps.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    The velvet garden and the cliffs are vividly and economically rendered, and the setting’s hush and texture match the story’s tone and concept. The garden is not just decorative: it’s the only place he can safely “remember,” and it becomes the site where the resonance structures manifest and Liora appears, charging the final image as dawn breaks. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful (dew-heavy petals, distant waves, shimmer at the heart of the roses). Still, the environment shapes mood more than concrete tactical choices, so its influence remains slightly atmospheric rather than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=7.8)
    The marble sanctuary, aurora, and stalactites are vivid and immediately atmospheric, with details like “stalactites that wept slow, rhythmic tears” building a distinct mood. The environment participates in the plot via the hidden altar mechanism, turning the sanctuary from mere backdrop into the site of revelation. However, the space rarely constrains tactics or movement; Lian and Vey could almost be anywhere with an altar, so the marble/aurora specifics are more aesthetic than causally binding. The final image of her stepping into the aurora’s light capitalizes nicely on the established setting as emotional and thematic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.4)
    The canyon, serpentine nexus, and starlit marketplace are vivid, specific, and filtered through Liora’s attention in ways that reinforce the sound-and-echo motif. Details like merchants trading in “bad echoes” and storytellers of stolen words deepen atmosphere while serving the thematic frame. The setting doesn’t tightly constrain tactical choices, but it clearly charges the final image of their song threading through the nexus and stars.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.4)
    The glacier shrine and melted snow globe provide a vivid, specific atmosphere; details like fogged glass, iced walls, and “borrowed starlight” feel integrated rather than decorative. The shrine functions as a micro-setting that frames her work space, ethical “confessional,” and the final charged image with the snow globe tear. While the physical environment doesn’t heavily constrain tactical choices, it does shape the metaphysics (dead in the ice, candles and fire altering relics). The recurring setting-object pairing (shrine + globe) meaningfully charges the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and particular—the mountainside village, mist, slick stones, parapet above communal noise, rain, and fireflies all filtered convincingly through Ren’s sensibility. Environmental details are purposeful: his height above the village underscores his solitude; the post-rain atmosphere and fireflies mirror the story’s reflective, almost liminal tone. The bamboo whisk and parapet serve as micro-setting anchors, recurring and charging the final image. While the environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical choices, it thoroughly saturates mood and theme in a way that feels lived-in rather than touristic.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=7.8)
    The wasteland orchard is vividly rendered—gnarled, glowing fruit, radioactive dust, spongy soil—and these details are filtered through Elias’s wary, professional eye. The stillpoint clearing and the orchard’s paradoxical thriving directly charge the final image of healing, aligning atmosphere with theme. That said, the environment rarely constrains tactics or creates concrete obstacles; it operates more as evocative backdrop than an active pressure shaping choices. Even so, the recurring orchard imagery meaningfully reweights the premise at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=8.2)
    Setting is a major strength: the “observatory perched on the spine of the world” and the stormlit descent create a vivid, cohesive atmosphere. The cobalt glass, aurora, and storm are not mere postcard details; they recur and charge the climactic imagery when Elias projects the ancient shadows. Weather and geography (the high observatory, dangerous descent, valley fires) support tone and stakes, even if they rarely hard-constrain tactics beyond mood and basic movement. The world’s rules feel consistent within this mythic register.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “feral loft beneath the dunes,” salt-smell, bruised dawn sky, and the sea’s murmur create a strongly textured, cohesive environment. Setting details are filtered through Elias’s ear and sensibility—everything is sound- and echo-oriented—which ties directly into his project. The loft and the sea don’t noticeably constrain his choices beyond supplying sounds and isolation, but they do charge the jars and music box with atmospheric weight. Overall, the place feels particular and lived-in, not generic.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    The drift-ice marina, groaning docks, and freezing water are vividly rendered and materially constrain choices (risk of destabilizing ice, danger of falling in, difficulty accessing the key). The lighthouse as an acoustic structure is well-integrated, with setting and technology merging into tactic rather than remaining mere backdrop. Environmental evolution from “fleeting golden sunset” to twilight supports mood and the sense of a narrowing window. The setting feels specific and lived-in, not a generic cold pier.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.5)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct are vividly rendered with strong sensory integration (“smelled of ozone and wet stone,” “ice…like a broken promise”). The environment is filtered well through Elias’s practiced attention to horizons and moon paths, giving the setting a lived-in specificity. However, the landscape mostly supports mood and theme rather than constraining or enabling distinct choices—the thin ice and storm-pregnant air could pressure tactics more. The final image of the glowing ice under the moon is resonant but still more symbolic than situationally binding.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=7.2)
    The subway maintenance tunnel is concretely evoked with smell, light, and industrial geometry, and the hidden room extends that environment plausibly. The setting shapes tactics—darkness enables stealth, the off-grid tunnel allows secret operations, and the door hidden among pipes is a key spatial beat. The lantern as object-setting hybrid charges the final image effectively. Some descriptions tend toward genre-standard rather than idiosyncratic, but they’re effective and integrated with action.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.4)
    The music box shop is vividly rendered through smell, texture, and light, and the weather outside mirrors internal stakes without overwhelming them. The clockwork heart functions as a micro-setting object, repeatedly handled and charging the atmosphere. However, the environment mostly frames mood rather than constraining concrete choices or tactics. The consistency of world rules around clockwork hearts and vanished surgeons feels plausible at this scale.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.2)
    The acid sea and groaning, rusted workshop are vividly rendered and consistently woven into action (groans, fumes, rising acid, gears grinding), creating a strong, oppressive atmosphere. Setting is filtered through Elias’s familiarity and defiance, avoiding tourist listing. The environment meaningfully pressures the story (the workshop’s structural failure is the time limit) and responds to the bell (sea stills), charging the final image. A slightly wider range of sensory detail beyond sound and sight could deepen immersion further, but what’s there is already strong.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.1)
    The archive as a “vast digital graveyard” gives a strong opening image and sets a fittingly ghosted, liminal atmosphere. Details like server logs, hidden folders, and metadata are specific enough to feel credible without bogging down. However, the environment rarely constrains her choices; it’s more metaphorical backdrop than an active obstacle or tool. The final reframe of the archive as “a battleground” adds conceptual charge but doesn’t yet manifest in concrete spatial or procedural stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.0)
    The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes is vivid and specific, and details like “vintage store mirrors” and groaning ice give the piece a strong atmospheric spine. Environment matters: the ice carries the monsters, the mirrors guide his route, and the lighthouse beam charges the closing image. The world’s rules (mirrors show possible futures, fragment interacts with them) are introduced through action rather than exposition. A bit more direct constraint from weather/terrain on Elias’s tactics would push this higher, but as is the setting is a real asset.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.2)
    The drift-ice marina and thawing floes are rendered with strong, selective sensory detail that sustains atmosphere (“low, mournful creak of thawing floes,” “ice groaning beneath him like a living thing”). Weather and environment affect tone and plausibly constrain action (frostbite, numb hands, skeletal docks) even if they don’t force explicit tactical choices. The heirloom parasol tip functions as a micro-setting object that charges the bedside scene and final image. Overall specificity is high and well-filtered through Elias’s preoccupation with endings.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The vineyard, amber pavilion, autumn weather, and bus station are vividly drawn and integrated with Liora’s perceptions rather than feeling like a backdrop tour. The vines and oak function as a micro-setting that meaningfully charge her realization about love’s slow, stubborn growth. Environmental details evolve across the scene (wind, pavilion creak, mist, damp earth) and support mood without bogging momentum. Setting doesn’t heavily constrain action, but it does strongly color the final image and thematic frame.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and idiosyncratic: the murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, and conjured clearings all feel like parts of a coherent, odd world. Details are strongly filtered through his experience (vibrations “like a second heartbeat,” wind refusing to enter the clearing), creating a strong atmosphere. The pavilion and clearing don’t just decorate; they frame how wisdom is accessed and literally fall silent to charge the final realization. The environment doesn’t deeply constrain tactical choices, but it clearly charges the final image and concept.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=7.4)
    The lavender field and rusted factory ruins are vividly and consistently evoked, with selective sensory detail (dew, light through broken windows, vines, soot) that supports the melancholic yet hopeful tone. Setting is tightly integrated with theme: industry decayed, nature reclaiming, past labor haunting the present. That said, the environment rarely constrains action or choice; it mostly functions as mood and metaphor more than as a live physical pressure. Strong atmosphere and specificity, but not yet using place to shape narrative options in a way that would push this into a higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.5)
    The library as a “shadowed library at dawn” is vivid and integrated—the smell of wax and paper, vaulted ceilings, timber groans, and angular light all serve atmosphere and mirror his listening. The crystal functions as a micro-setting object whose properties shape what he can do and charge the last image (“facets catching the light like a promise”). Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered through a scholar attuned to sound and silence, avoiding touristy cataloguing. Environment doesn’t physically constrain his options much, but it strongly charges tone and the conceptual stakes, meeting the 9-band gate on object-as-setting but falling just short in sheer pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.5)
    The fog sculpture garden, with its rusted-wire faces and damp earth, is vivid, specific, and tonally aligned with memory erosion and industrial decay. Setting is not mere backdrop: the fog’s partial concealment, the driftwood spiral on the ground, and the stone at the center all structure his actions and the revelation. The “hush of old videotapes left unwatched” elegantly fuses atmosphere with the core conceit of recorded-yet-forgotten time. While the environment could push constraint even further, it already meaningfully charges the final image of him stepping into a just-cleared path.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=7.8)
    The lunar observatory above the clouds, the domed roof, the central chronometer, and the failing stabilizers create a vivid, coherent physical and atmospheric frame that’s strongly integrated with the action. Tools, camera, and clock serve as micro-setting elements that meaningfully constrain choices and power the central conceit. Environmental shifts—the shaking foundations, the moon revealed through the clouds, the final fall of the observatory—track cleanly and mirror the story’s thematic arc. There’s room to deepen tactile engagement with the space under stress, but what’s here is purposeful and effective.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    The “radiant haven above the clouds” and frosted-glass room are vividly rendered through multiple senses, especially the recurring “scent of hope” and the play of light. Setting and atmosphere consistently echo the emotional stakes, with the environment’s gentleness contrasting the severity of the situation. The room doesn’t strongly constrain tactics, but it does frame the entire encounter as liminal space between life and death. The final return to twilight and “pulsing stillness” effectively charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.0)
    The observatory, floating isle, humming walls, and mirror chamber are vivid and integrated into action rather than static backdrop. Details like ozone and old metal, the spiral descent, and the dome opening at noon effectively shape atmosphere and charge the final image of enduring shadows. The world’s odd history (“after spoons bent reality”) adds flavor, though it’s more tonal than functional. Environment does constrain where the secret can be and frames the discovery, even if it doesn’t strongly limit tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.4)
    The garden and hedge maze are vivid and integral: the hidden space, damp earth, unnamed flower colors, and apple tree roots all feel tactile and lived-in. Setting is not postcard decoration; it shapes options—the garden is literally where rules bend, where teeth are found, where the ritual can happen, and where the child is kept and then released. The recurring objects (tree, teeth, maze) charge the final walk back with clear resonance. A bit more environmental constraint or obstacle during the maze traversal could have pushed this into the top band.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.3)
    The grotto and mist are vividly realized (“exhaled mist like a sleeping dragon,” “serpentine walls,” bioluminescent glow), and the environment feels tactile as she wades into cold water. Setting details are filtered through her preoccupations with light and reflection, tying atmosphere directly to theme. The grotto meaningfully shapes action—she must physically enter, endure the cold, and locate the crevice where the pearl rests. While the environment doesn’t place her under real threat, it does charge the journey and final emergence image with a strong, coherent mood.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    The moss-overgrown data center is vividly rendered and threaded through the whole piece, from threshold to central hub to skylights shedding thawing icicles. It meaningfully charges the final image—“I think it belongs here”—turning the space into a repository for reconfigured grief, not mere backdrop. The recurring environmental details (moss, rust, icicles, broken skylights) mirror thawing emotional stasis without feeling like blunt symbolism. Setting could constrain physical choice a bit more, but as an emotional and thematic arena it is highly effective.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=8.3)
    The misty nexus, river running against its own flow, and the smell of “damp earth and old paper” are vivid and consistently threaded, shaping tone and reinforcing the story’s liminal, book-haunted world. Setting exerts gentle pressure—the current that urges him back, the nexus that seems to expel him—so environment isn’t mere backdrop. Details are selective and pointed (mist as turning pages; river as resistance to or embodiment of his choice). The one limitation is that the world’s rules stay primarily atmospheric rather than constraining concrete tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.2)
    The arbor is richly and economically realized—“cathedral of leaves,” crushed mint, spiraled bark—and consistently filtered through Liora’s sensibility. The setting is not just decorative: the arbor’s history as the place of “the first song” and the response of its spirals to her singing anchor the magic and closure. Environmental detail evolves with events (light blooming, hush deepening) in ways that heighten the thematic “remembering.” The world beyond the arbor is sketched only lightly, but that narrow focus suits the scene’s scale.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.0)
    The withered orchard in a subarctic crater is vivid and tonally apt, with cold, silence, and twilight all reinforcing the “held breath” atmosphere. Environmental details are economically chosen and filtered through Elias’s need for quiet, not as a static postcard. The setting doesn’t strongly constrain his tactical options, but it does charge the ritual with a sense of isolation and suspended time. The orchard’s “silence as a living thing” usefully mirrors and amplifies the thematic pause he seeks to preserve.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.5)
    The marble cavern, quartz veins, skylight, and seasonal light are vivid and integrated, not postcard décor. The environment materially shapes events: quartz reflections and weakening light enable the apparition and focus Elias’s experiments. The setting’s timeless, humming quality dovetails with the echoes concept and charges the final image of “time rewinding.” It feels lived-in and purposeful, though a slightly tighter link between the physical cold/seasonal constraint and his present choice could raise it further.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.7)
    The bronze grotto, snowmelt, starlight, and burner form a tightly integrated micro-setting whose physical properties matter (bronze ribs, acoustics, thin north wall, calcifying air). Environmental details are vivid and selective—dripping meltwater, hardening shadows—and mirror the emotional work without feeling like blunt symbols. The grotto actively shapes tactics (where she faces, how the hush becomes a vessel) and charges the final image when the drip becomes “a song.” This is close to top-tier; a single more concrete interaction with the constraints of bronze/space could push it into the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    The loft and skylight are vividly rendered (“damp wool and old tea,” “rain-beaded skylight”) and consistently filtered through her grief, creating a strong, unified atmosphere. Environmental elements interact with action—the warped floorboards, the kettle, the light on the knife and carving—so setting is never postcard-static. The skylight rain and shifting light charge the final image, where the now-muted light softens the carving and mirrors her internal softening. This is precise, economic world-building that directly supports tone and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.5)
    The kinetic lagoon and broken carousel are striking, coherent images that define the story’s physics (time slippage, mismatched reflections) and mood. Details such as the rusted platform, fogging breath, and horses “staring into nothing” are economical yet vivid, and consistently filtered through her sensibility. The lagoon’s rules appear through action (man emerging younger, ghost-rising water) rather than exposition. The final image—the lagoon humming with unfinished stories—shows the environment actively charging the closure rather than serving as mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.5)
    The abandoned spaceport is vivid and specific, from “cathedral of forgotten dreams” to neon carnival residue and crumbling walkways, and it materially shapes action by providing the broken irrigation system that guides Mara to the greenhouse. The greenhouse and water flows are integrated as lived-in micro-settings, not just backdrop, and the sextant functions as a charged tool-like object. The final image of plants thriving inside this ruin directly reweights the setting into a site of resilience, satisfying the high-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    The settings—the Clocktower Spire, Vaelis at dawn, and especially the crystal forecourt—are vivid, sensory, and filtered through Elias’s history with them. Details like oil and parchment scent, quartz cobbles refracting dew, and humming stones not only enrich atmosphere but directly charge the final image. The forecourt in particular evolves from childhood refuge to avoided wound to the place where he finally listens, so the environment meaningfully shapes and embodies the closure. A slightly stronger sense of the Spire’s physical constraints on his life could push this even higher.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.2)
    The twilight barge canal and the barge’s hold are vividly, efficiently rendered (lanterns like “dying stars,” “paint peeling like old skin,” smell of “damp parchment”). Setting is integrated with action and mood rather than tacked on, and the still water/creaking hulls at the end effectively mirror the charged pause of his realization. The micro-setting doesn’t strongly constrain options but it does meaningfully charge the final image, especially with the sundial and mirror functioning as tools/objects-in-space. Atmosphere is a clear strength and well matched to the story’s introspective stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.4)
    The harbor, golden dock under snow, fog, and fulgurite are vivid, sensorial, and tightly interwoven with Elias’s worldview as a “philosophical seed collector.” Weather and environment (creaking dock, thickening fog, muffled sound) strongly shape the atmosphere and subtly echo the theme of buried, patient secrets. The final image returns to snow, creaking dock, and waiting secrets, giving the setting clear participation in closure, though it doesn’t significantly constrain concrete choices. This is rich, purposeful worldbuilding just short of using environment as a true tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.4)
    The garden in autumn is vivid and sensorial (“scent of damp earth and decaying leaves”) and strongly filters through Lena’s grief-saturated attention. The environment meaningfully charges the final image: the soil receives the thread, wind drops leaves, shadows “swallow her whole,” all of which entwine setting with theme and closure. The palace carpet and its geographic imagery extend setting into a symbolic micro-setting that feels organic rather than forced. A slight limitation is that the environment constrains choice more thematically than physically, but at this length that’s effective.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=7.8)
    The suspended palace, chains, cavern, and industrial blight are vividly rendered and tonally coherent, giving the story a strong, atmospheric frame. Details like the dust-choked halls, cracked-glass flowers, and the brass contraption feel selective and purposeful, mirroring his clung-to nostalgia and failed rationalism. However, the environment rarely constrains choices or tactics; the palace and cavern could largely be swapped for another isolated ruin without altering the action. This keeps the setting powerful as mood but less than fully integrated as an active force.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.0)
    The obsidian lagoon, black sand, reeds, and migrating clouds create a distinct, atmospheric place that’s consistently filtered through Lena’s lens as a firefighter and survivor of fire. The volcanic sand and glassy water resonate thematically with destruction transmuted into beauty, and the setting recurs in the closing image (“the lagoon held them all—past, present, and the promise of peace”). Environment doesn’t much constrain physical choice, but it shapes emotional stance and meaning throughout. The balance of sensory detail and mood is strong without drifting into a catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    The city of forgotten fountains, dry basins, and leaf-choked grand fountain create a vivid, tonally aligned environment that feels lived-in and thematically apt. Specific textures—the chipped cobblestone, wrought-iron gates, spiral staircase slick with damp—anchor the surreal elements in tactile detail. Setting does more than decorate: the broken water system and central fountain physically house the lock and descent point, and mirror the “stuck” memories. The final “room filled with light” is a bit generic compared to the earlier atmospheric richness, muting the last image’s distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.4)
    The nebula garden is vividly rendered and integral: petals “shiver” and glow in response to sonar, and the environment behaves consistently as an almost-living archive. Setting is tightly woven into action and theme, culminating in the final image of the nebula swallowing the ship and its light lingering. The calculating gear and petals operate as micro-setting objects/images that charge the ending. The environment doesn’t strongly constrain available choices, but it does frame and intensify them.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.4)
    The settings—the misty town, stone workshop, and especially the ancient greenhouse—are vivid, sensorial, and tied to Elias’s emotional state (e.g., “glass panes cracked like spiderwebs,” jasmine, fireflies, rusted iron). The greenhouse becomes a charged locus where memory, mentorship, and ritual converge, and it’s integral to the father-son connection. The butterfly migration and dusk light layer atmosphere and subtly mark the passage of time and transformation, culminating in the ribbon-banner over the greenhouse entrance. The environment guides mood more than it constrains choices, which keeps this just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.0)
    The obsidian ridge, tidal shelf, and clock tower are vividly drawn and folded into mood and theme rather than serving as postcard backdrops. The pendulum, tower, and rake handle function as micro-setting elements that charge the final image and anchor the story’s metaphysics. However, the physical environment rarely constrains tactics or choices beyond atmosphere; Elias could almost perform the same ritual in a less-specific locale without much structural change. Still, the selective detail and consistency of the world’s rules support the piece very well at this length.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt silo and riverbank are vividly rendered and integrated into action: the labyrinthine interior, niches, and river bend guide his search and discoveries. Sensory detail (“velveteen gloom,” “current lapped…like a cat at a saucer of milk”) is specific and tonally aligned without feeling like a static tour. The setting’s physicality grounds the puzzle and charges the final image of him on the silo floor with the tapestry. It rarely constrains choices hard, but it consistently shapes mood and movement.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.0)
    The obsidian spire over the frozen lake, the cold chamber, frost scent, and silver-ink maps create a vivid, tonally coherent environment. The quill and parchment act as micro-setting objects that sit naturally in this world. The setting does influence mood and concept (maps of the unknowable, frozen stasis vs. warming during creation) but doesn’t materially constrain tactics or options in the scene. Still, specificity is strong and consistently filtered through Elara’s cartographic/intellectual lens.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ember alcove, mist, dust, and radio create a vivid, coherent micro-world whose sensory specifics (damp ash, parchment, pulsing dial, swirling dust) are strongly filtered through Elias’s attention to remnants. The environment materially shapes the premise—dust is ubiquitous, the alcove is hidden and warm, the outside is mist and famine—and charges the final image of beginnings in a place of endings. Setting and object-as-setting (dust, radio) are tightly interwoven with the story’s logic rather than postcard backdrops. This atmospheric integration is at or near publishable quality.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.0)
    The vanishing point gallery, rocking chair, and fireplace form a cohesive, tactile space that feels lived-in and thematically charged. Visual and tactile details (“walls lined with paintings that seemed to breathe,” “wood worn smooth by decades of restless motion”) are selective and purposeful. The gallery’s logic as a place of hollow beauty and vanishing points dovetails with the emotional stakes and charges the decision to exit. The setting could constrain his choices a bit more explicitly, but it already does strong atmospheric and symbolic work.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.5)
    The sewer and sunken city are vividly evoked through smell, texture, and specific history, and the cog works as a charged micro-setting object. Environmental detail is filtered through Elias’s sensibility (sewer as sanctuary, surface as cowardly forgetfulness), which deepens tone. The setting does shape his broad life choice (hiding below vs surfacing), but in the present moment it constrains tactics only lightly. Strong atmosphere, slightly under-leveraged as an active constraint on his final move.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=7.9)
    The velvet library, autumn weather, and cobblestones are sensuously rendered and aligned with the mood of fading arts and tentative renewal. Details like the scent of “aged paper and cinnamon” and the library “drinking in the harmony” feel particular and filtered through Elara’s sensibility. The setting does more atmospheric mirroring than concrete constraining of choices, so it’s powerful backdrop rather than an active obstacle or tool. Still, the return to the library and leaves at the end recharges the opening imagery effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=7.5)
    The rusted greenhouse and ruined city form a vivid, coherent atmosphere of decay contrasted with fragile regrowth. Details like “iron ribs groaning” and “benches sagging under the weight of forgotten experiments” are specific and thematically apt, and the greenhouse meaningfully reframes from relic to “beginning.” The environment doesn’t strongly constrain physical options, but it does charge the final image with a sense of hard-won sanctuary. Overall, setting is a clear strength without quite becoming architecturally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.3)
    The lightning tower, humming copper veins, ozone, burnt sugar, floating gardens, and “nectar dusk” provide a vivid, coherent atmosphere that feels both industrial and enchanted. Setting is tightly integrated with plot: the tower’s function (collecting and remembering lightning) directly constrains the solution, and the beehives’ placement “like dying stars” charges the final image. Details are economical and filtered through Elias’s perspective, avoiding tour-guide excess. A slightly deeper sense of how the broader city lives under this infrastructure could have elevated it further, but at this length the focus reads appropriately selective.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.4)
    The quiet bay in spring, the streetlights that “daydream,” and the leaning clapboard house all build a cohesive, tactile atmosphere that directly supports the story’s eerie restraint. Environmental details are filtered through Elias’s sensibility (e.g., tides, pilings, smell of salt and damp earth) and echo the theme of patient, watchful stillness. The orris shard as a small, charged object is integrated into setting as well as plot, especially once it becomes a “shard of hush.” The setting rarely constrains tactics, but it strongly charges tone and the final image of the bay waiting.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.7)
    The drowned garden and underwater city are vividly evoked (“marble paths now slick with algae,” “threading through the city’s bones like blood through veins”) and recur as charged images at the end when the garden is “alive again, but not as it had been.” The environment—submerged ruins, fissured foundations, the single gnarled tree—does more than decorate; it is the literal mechanism of containment and release. While the underwater conditions don’t overtly constrain minute-to-minute tactics, the setting’s physical structure (fissure, roots, stone) and atmosphere are inseparable from the story’s logic and closing image. This falls just short of 9-band because the environment shapes meaning and mechanics more than it actively pressures moment-to-moment choice.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.8)
    The staircase as setting is vivid and tonally apt: worn stone, thick air, the spiral and later its slight off-kilter tilt all reinforce the premise. Details are selective and filtered through Elias’s purpose—step-counting, thin air, the tactile chipped die on the stone. The environment matters conceptually (its “infinity” and motion are the problem) but less in immediate tactical terms beyond providing steps to climb. Still, the altered staircase at the end charges the final image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=8.7)
    The setting is vivid and selective: the smog “thick as wool,” the rooftop greenhouse as a fragile clean bubble, and the moonlight cutting through all act as lived environment rather than backdrop. Details are tightly filtered through her priorities as a painter and insomniac, with the air, glass, and light all tied to her work and mood. The micro-setting meaningfully charges the final image—the moonlight through glass, the warm greenhouse against a rotting city, the bone-handled brush as relic. It stops just short of 9-band only because setting doesn’t significantly constrain specific tactical choices beyond shaping her isolation and ritual.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    The grotto city behind the waterfall is vivid and specific—the mist, roar, wet rock, and hives above the falls create a distinctive atmosphere filtered through Liora’s sensibility. Setting details (museum, Hall of Echoes, bakery, hives) are well integrated into action and theme rather than feeling like a tour. However, the environment mostly charges mood and symbolism rather than concretely constraining choices or tactics; Vaelis could be swapped for another singular locale without breaking the story’s logic. The recurring opera glass and tapestry do effectively charge the final image, nudging this into the strong-but-not-exceptional band.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lighthouse, black-toothed island, storm, and low tide create an immediate, vivid atmosphere that’s both gothic and purpose-driven. Setting constrains action (low tide to reach the hunger stone, isolation for experimentation) and the lighthouse beam literally interacts with the yoyo’s ascent. The environment evolves with the event—the storm unraveling, tide reversing—so the world responds to the magic rather than remaining static backdrop. This is richly specific and integrated, just shy of the very top tier because we never see Elias’s choices meaningfully blocked or rerouted by the physical environment.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.4)
    The abandoned carnival and funhouse are rendered with rich, selective detail—“rust and caramelized sugar,” “splintered like broken teeth,” warped mirrors—anchoring mood and action. The environment isn’t just backdrop: the mirrors are the site and mechanism of conflict, and the funhouse’s “lie” is thematically weaponized. Spatially, the hall of mirrors and transition to outside are clear and coherent. The setting charges the final image of him leaving into cleaner air, even if physical constraints don’t actively limit his tactical options beyond forcing confrontation within the mirrors.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is unusually vivid and particular: the orchard-raft, salt-brined fruit, sun-bleached planks, and blue hour light all feel textured and inhabited. Environment and objects aren’t just backdrop; the driftwood, roots, and trees literally become the instrument, and the sea’s responsiveness shapes the “performance” in the final image. World rules (sea as responsive medium, clouds as score) are consistently applied and learned through action rather than exposition. The orchard-raft and blue hour charge the ending strongly enough to function as micro-setting and object-as-setting.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.3)
    The city on turtle backs, salt flats, and the damp, spiral-carved cavern are vivid and specific, with recurring details (spiral motifs, bone-and-coral towers, amber windows) that feel lived-in rather than touristic. Setting integrates with action—she chisels the turtle shell itself; the crack is materially part of the world, not a generic portal—and the salt flats and horizon line help stage the watchers. However, the environment rarely constrains immediate choice beyond providing the crack-door; weather, topography, and the turtles’ nature don’t yet shape tactics in the climax. The recurring spirals and shells do help charge the final image conceptually.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=7.4)
    The station, ivy, cold air, and rosebush are vivid and specific, creating a strong, moody atmosphere that suits the ethical murk. Details are generally well-filtered through Elias’s focus and profession. The rosebush and ivy do good symbolic work and the final glimpse back charges the ending image. The environment, however, rarely constrains tactics or choices beyond the rose-as-timer, keeping this more atmospheric than structurally indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.5)
    The submerged pavilion, cold river, and drawbridge are vivid and integral; details like half-buried arches, silt, and groaning stones feel tactile and specific. Setting is consistently filtered through Elias’s sensibility (e.g., “only the river remembered,” “the pavilion breathed”), which deepens mood without lapsing into generic description. Environment and objects meaningfully constrain choices: the water depth, cracked foundation, and hidden crevices force physical searching, and the inkwell as a tool/object-as-setting literally powers his responses and empties by the end. The drawbridge/locked island constraint is nicely gestured at, though its ticking-clock potential could be leveraged a bit more directly in his choices.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.0)
    The submerged library and its filtered, shifting light are vividly realized and consistently tied to mood (“reclaimed stillness,” “dappled shadows”). Environmental details—the water outside, the warped ledger, the old floorboards—are filtered through Elias’s professional eye and support the contemplative tone. The setting doesn’t sharply constrain physical options, but it conceptually shapes the story’s stakes as a place where the past is literally preserved under pressure. The final contrast between the waking city and the quiet library charges the last image effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid, specific, and integrated with character: the floating tea garden, upside-down bonsai, chains of silver, and glass basilica all feel tactile and emotionally charged. Details are filtered through Veyra’s sensibility as a maker and mourner, not as a tourist; the garden is a memorial, the basilica a resource to plunder. World rules (detached shadow, dream-pools) stay consistent and are efficiently taught through image rather than exposition. While the environment doesn’t greatly constrain tactical choices in the climax, it deeply textures the stakes and mood.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory is atmospheric and specific—creaking girders, fractured dome, cooling circuit breakers—filtered through Lena’s haunted focus and grief. Environmental elements do shape action: the temporary power outage grants her window, the reboot/alarm build pushes her to flee, and the rusted, unstable structure contributes to a sense of peril. The “floating” aspect is underused; it’s declared but doesn’t constrain tactics or imagery in a distinctive way. Still, the setting feels lived-in and tonally precise, supporting both the gothic and SF valences of the piece.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    The observatory is vividly realized—“dome yawned open,” “brass teeth,” ozone and parchment—and the sky and machinery are tightly integrated with the action via the drone and starfeed. The environment isn’t just wallpaper; it supplies the tools (dome, receiver, drone) that make the discovery and the “call” possible. While the setting shapes possibility more than it constrains choice, it does charge the final image of them vanishing into the observatory’s dimness while the stars wait. Specificity is strong and filtered through the scene’s mood rather than a neutral catalogue.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.2)
    The cobalt terrace, bruised sky, driftwood “ghost fingers,” and cold cobblestones create a vivid, moody environment that tracks the emotional arc. The shore and carvings are not postcard background; they are the investigative medium that yields the symbol and thus the uncle’s entrance. The setting doesn’t heavily constrain options beyond providing the search locus, but it does charge the investigation with an uncanny atmosphere. The boathouse and gate are gestured to rather than lived in, which slightly limits depth.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.4)
    The parapet, sea, mist, and moon are vividly rendered and feel integral rather than decorative; “Too high for ambushes, too exposed for secrets” directly links environment to tactics and tone. The recurring sea and weather imagery reinforces the themes of erosion, regret, and inevitability. Micro-setting details (wet stone, wind tugging at Seris’s braid, the cold iron) are well-chosen and filtered through Elias’s sensibility. The setting also meaningfully charges the final image of dawn and mist as they separate, so it does real thematic work.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.8)
    The coastal launch, tide, island, and utility poles give the story tangible place and atmosphere, and the sea/island environment shapes the physical form of Elias’s renunciation (hurling the compass into waves). Details like “merrily melancholic” tide and “jagged rocks…like broken teeth” are vivid and tonally apt. The setting mirrors his internal state without tipping into heavy-handed symbolism. While strong, the environment could constrain his choices more directly to reach an even higher band.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=7.5)
    The underground bioluminescent lake is vivid and tonally apt, and the glowing water and moist tunnels are well-integrated into action (ripples, lapping at boots, guiding light). The mirror chamber is conceptually strong, though its physicality could be sharpened with an extra sensory detail or two. Setting enhances atmosphere and theme rather than feeling like a backdrop, but it rarely constrains choice in concrete ways. Overall, specificity and mood are strong, if not yet transformative.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.2)
    The orchard under a permanent moon, glowing fruit, and spice-scented air create a vivid, sensorially rich atmosphere that’s tightly filtered through Liora’s perceptions. Setting is not mere backdrop: the tree is the locus of his emergence and the orchard “sighs in approval,” charging the final image. Details are economical yet distinctive, with scents (cinnamon, clove, cardamom, cedar) doing double duty as worldbuilding and magical mechanism. The environment could constrain her options a bit more explicitly to reach top-tier, but as-is it strongly supports tone and theme.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.2)
    The “midnight glade above the clouds” is vividly realized—silvered grass, trees rooted in cloud-breath, ozone and crushed violets—creating a strong, specific atmosphere. Setting details are consistently filtered through her ritual focus and melancholy, and the saucer, ink, and cloth function as micro-settings that charge the final image. World rules (cloudbound village, glade not of earth) feel internally coherent and are learned through observation rather than exposition. The environment enhances mood more than it constrains action, which keeps it just shy of the very top band.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: recycled hull, bioluminescent algae, faded photographs, and ghosts all coherently build an atmosphere of exhausted, haunted futurity. The ship is not just backdrop; as a “floating reliquary of human regret” and ultimate entrant into the wound, it actively shapes the story’s logic and ending image. Environmental details are filtered through Liora’s ritualistic focus, keeping description economical rather than touristic. While physical constraints of the environment don’t much alter tactics moment to moment, the ship-as-body metaphor charges the final dissolution powerfully.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=7.8)
    The black sand beach, looming volcano, and “slow dance” of celestial bodies create a strong, textured atmosphere that feels particular rather than generic. Setting is integrated into stakes (imminent eruption) and inciting geography (detour to the beach) rather than serving as a postcard backdrop. The lightning bug jar works as a micro-setting object, gaining weight when its light flares and finally dies at the tremor. Still, the environment doesn’t significantly constrain tactics or options beyond premise-level danger, which keeps it shy of the very highest band.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=8.5)
    The luminous fort with bioluminescent moss, brass goggles, and the armory’s low lanterns is vivid, specific, and consistently filtered through Mira’s practical eye. Setting details do real work: the blackout, moss-light, and corridors she knows intimately all shape what’s possible and how she moves. The torch in the armory and the fort’s glow at her back charge the final image and concretize the “spark” motif. This is close to publication-grade atmosphere with strong object-as-setting integration.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=8.5)
    The tidal bluff, aurora, and eel-filled shallows are vivid and tightly integrated into action—the placement of rocks at tidal and auroral focal points literally uses geography as mechanism. The atmosphere (salt-stiff air, shimmering aurora, damp earth) is specific and consistent, supporting the numinous tone. The setting’s rules (threads, patterns, first collapse) feel coherent within the piece’s own logic and charge the final flare of the aurora and return of friction. This is close to top-tier environmental integration, just shy of using constraint even more aggressively to limit options.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=8.5)
    The observatory above the clouds in a lightning storm is striking and sustained; weather, light, and architecture are all integrated with Elias’s perception rather than feeling like postcard description. The darkroom timer and photograph act as micro-settings that he handles and reinterprets, and the storm directly charges the central image by literally illuminating the “map” at the climax. Tone and environment are tightly braided—“furiously tranquil” and “storm-kissed wonder” are borne out by the sensory detail. The space doesn’t quite constrain his choices, but it does palpably charge the final image, which earns it into the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=7.8)
    The glass atrium and brook are more than wallpaper: the brook’s sound evolves from soothing to countdown to roar, and the glass/water/light interplay is mirrored in the sundial and perforated card. The environment functions as a subtle stage for illumination and reflection, culminating in the “atrium’s glass walls seemed to dissolve” beat. While the setting doesn’t hard-constrain tactics, the sundial as an embedded environmental tool meaningfully shapes action and the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=7.9)
    The rusted library with “skeletal ribs,” mildew air, and the moonlit, rotting city creates a vivid, coherent atmosphere that suits the themes of decay and rebirth. The setting is more than backdrop: the locked library and its intact shelves concretize the possibility of rebuilding, and the stars / rain scent gently charge the ending. However, the environment rarely constrains tactics beyond supplying a door to open and shelves to sort, so its role remains primarily symbolic rather than pressure-bearing. Still, the physicality and recurrence of library, city, and sky give the piece strong spatial presence.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal arbor above the clouds is vivid, tactile, and conceptually distinctive, with the ocean’s pulse, salt mist, bioluminescent moss, and rooted architecture all integrated into action. The setting constrains and charges choices: its isolation and height make it the “perfect stage,” the roots connect to the storming sea, and the waves physically reach back up at the climax. Environmental phenomena (compass storms, cloud cover, horizon light) pattern the story’s emotional and narrative beats rather than serving as static backdrop. The final image of ocean, arbor, and ticking clock reads as inseparable from this particular world.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is vivid and purposeful: the glowing ridge, bioluminescent blossoms, twin moons, and storm-season ecology all feel specific and lived-in. The ridge is not just a backdrop; it becomes a “living archive,” and the monsoon and blossoms charge the final image and the core stakes. World rules around the storm and its pact are consistent and folded into the action of planting and reading rather than dumped. A slight limitation is that weather/terrain never materially constrain tactics beyond creating an abstract deadline.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=8.7)
    The islet after rain, the mist among pines, the cottage, and the shore create a vivid, coherent atmosphere that matches the story’s emotional temperature. Objects-as-setting—the bonsai, compass, and lace—are tactile and recur in ways that matter to choice and closure (especially the lace and compass in the final beats). Sensory detail is selective and purposeful, tied to Elias’s slow attention rather than gratuitous description. The environment shapes mood and symbolism more than concrete constraints, but it clearly charges the final image of breeze and possibility.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details like the sticky latex and damp wood effectively ground the "micro-setting" of the workbench, adhering to the economy bias. However, the atmosphere is weakened by worn clichés in the broader descriptions ("cracked like spiderwebs," "skeleton of its former self") which fail the specificity test for high-end literary fiction.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmospheric details like "frost-kissed stones" and the "blackened husk" effectively ground the scene in a cold, tactile reality. The opening description ("walls hummed with the weight of silence") veers slightly into purple prose but establishes the mood well.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=7.7)
    The "winterglass" conservatory and the "frozen leviathan" imagery create a vivid, atmospheric container for the story. The sensory details of cold and color effectively ground the abstract premise of visualizing sound.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric blending of the underwater environment with the library setting is vivid and effectively establishes the magical realist tone. Specific details like "scent of old paper and salt" work well, though the transition between land and water lacks visceral sensory struggle.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=6.4)
    The physical setting of the arbor and ridge is established with some sensory detail ("sun-warmed tiles," "lavender"), but the atmosphere relies on familiar descriptors. The imagery is coherent but often leans into romanticized abstraction ("whispering secrets," "captured star") rather than gritty, specific textures.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=7.7)
    The atmospheric details of the viaduct and wisteria are vivid and ground the surreal elements effectively. However, the camera obscura functions more as a magical scrying device than an optical tool, which slightly strains the verisimilitude of the specific setting element.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=7.7)
    The atmospheric blending of the garden and the Victorian past is vivid and immersive. The intrusion of the mathematical term "hyperbolic geometry," however, clashes with the established organic and magical tone, momentarily breaking immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=6.4)
    Atmosphere is established, but specific details fight realism; "stale popcorn" smell would have vanished or turned to rot after years of abandonment, reading as a cinematic trope rather than a sensory reality. The setting serves the plot but lacks lived-in texture.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.3)
    The setting is integral to the story's logic and emotional weight; the "sunken orchard greenhouse" and "shipwrecks" are not merely backdrop but the source of the sensory input Elias interprets. The forge serves as the crucible for the climax, and the "iron ribs" mirroring the shipwrecks creates a unified visual language. The environment actively charges the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=4.7)
    Setting details are vivid but strictly ornamental ("emerald tiles," "glowing like fireflies"), providing a static backdrop rather than creating constraints or resources that shape the characters' choices. The environment sets a mood but does not pressure the action.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=6.1)
    Sensory details in the control room ("smelled of rust," "dying bees") are effective and ground the scene. However, the connection between the mechanical setting and the glassblowing backstory remains largely metaphorical.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=6.0)
    The rusted library is established with some sensory detail ("smelled of damp paper and rust"), creating a functional atmosphere. However, the setting feels like a static backdrop for the prompt elements rather than an active force pressuring the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=6.7)
    Sensory details are vivid ("dried honey," "wet earth and iron"), effectively establishing a moody atmosphere. However, the setting functions primarily as a static backdrop for internal monologue rather than a physical space that constrains action.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric details are the story's strength, with the "transparent violin" and "pedestal of frost" creating a vivid, chilly mood. While "shattered mirror" is a cliché, the specific sensory details of the ice humming and the courtyard's twilight effectively ground the surreal elements.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=7.1)
    The atmosphere of the cinema is palpable, with sensory details like "old celluloid" and "mist" grounding the scene. However, the "crystal whispering forecourt" feels like a forced insertion that sits awkwardly against the grittier realism of the ticket stubs and rain.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=8.8)
    The garden maze functions effectively as both setting and antagonist, constraining choice and reacting to the protagonist's actions. The sensory details ("leaves brittle as old parchment," "metallic sheen") are vivid, though some rely on familiar similes. The environment actively shapes the narrative trajectory.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, effectively blending the "mechanically warm" station interior with the hostile gas giant environment. Sensory details like the fogging glass and the "faint, living heat" ground the reader, though the specific geography of the nexus interaction is somewhat static.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=7.2)
    The flooded opera house is realized with vivid, specific sensory details; the water-warped program functions effectively as a micro-setting that constrains the protagonist's investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid, with the "groaning" station and the "bruised" valley effectively mirroring Elias's internal state. The isolation is palpable and shapes the mood well. The sensory details of the flower ("shattered glass") are sharp and memorable.

  * grade_story_wc_115.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory details like "wet concrete" and "old oil" effectively establish a tactile, grimy atmosphere. The specific micro-setting of the train tunnel within the mill adds a unique, claustrophobic layer that constrains the encounter well. However, the geography feels slightly pliable to accommodate the tunnel concept.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the obsidian refuge and the library are rendered with vivid, specific sensory details that ground the surrealism. The setting actively facilitates the resolution (the river absorbing the ink), satisfying the requirement for the environment to constrain or enable choice.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with vivid but clichéd imagery ("cradled... like a lullaby," "sang when no one was listening"). The "ordinary magic" is described in abstract, poetic terms rather than through concrete constraints that shape character tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=8.4)
    The silo library is a standout creation, physically active and atmospherically distinct ("concrete ribs," "smelling of old wheat"). The setting actively participates in the climax (tilting shelves, groaning walls), integrating the environment seamlessly into the narrative pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=7.5)
    The specific mechanics of the lighthouse lens ("where the light bends") are successfully integrated into the discovery beat, grounding the mystery in the setting. While functional, some atmospheric details ("fog like a metronome") feel slightly strained or standard for the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_12.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "dimensional anchor" is grounded well by the tactile details of the pedal and paint, creating a distinct sci-fi/fantasy atmosphere. The sensory environment reacts cohesively to the ritual (humming walls, spreading violet), enhancing the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_120.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is visually distinct ("frozen breath," "molten glass") but functions more as a surreal backdrop than a constraint on action. The imagery is vivid but occasionally redundant ("fractured prisms"), and the environment doesn't force tactile negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=6.4)
    The viaduct is established with decent sensory grounding ("wet stones," "ozone"), but the "labyrinth of self" dissolves into abstract descriptors ("infinite permutations") that lack tactile specificity. The setting essentially disappears during the pivotal middle sequence, reducing environmental pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atmospheric setup of the cavern is competent, with sensory details like "cured hides" and "aged wood" establishing a clear mood. However, the description of the acoustics ("audibly muted") is phrased awkwardly, and the setting serves more as a backdrop than a pressure cooker for the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with specific sensory details like "old coins left in the rain" grounding the scene. The setting effectively mirrors the protagonist's mood, though the "bruised sky" opener is a slight cliché that softens the initial hook.

  * grade_story_wc_124.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with olfactory details effectively grounding the memory theme. The greenhouse of "ghost blooms" is a vivid, specific setting that mirrors the internal conflict, though the "lantern broker" occupation feels slightly ornamental to the immediate plot mechanics.

  * grade_story_wc_125.txt (grade=7.2)
    The terra-cotta grotto is vivid and specific, actively constraining the character's movement and choices. Sensory details like the "pulsing" walls and "stiff fibers" successfully ground the abstract premise in a tangible environment.

  * grade_story_wc_126.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and specific, utilizing "damp air" and "curved glass" to ground the acoustic experience; the integration of the environment with the character's purpose is the story's strongest feature.

  * grade_story_wc_127.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "amber grotto" provides a coherent, if standard, atmospheric backdrop. While sensory details like the "static clinging" are vivid, the setting functions largely as ornamentation ("honeyed glow," "living heart") rather than a constraint that pressures the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_128.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "breezy library under stars" and "salt-tinged night air" provide a grounded, sensory-rich opening that effectively anchors the atmosphere. Specific details, such as the flour-dusted arms, enhance the physical reality of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_129.txt (grade=7.3)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, successfully blending the organic and the crystalline, though it relies heavily on standard "mystical" adjectives (shimmering, glimmering, pulsing). The obsidian arbor serves as a strong focal point, but the "forgotten constellations" and "liquid silver" veer into generic high-fantasy aesthetic rather than specific, lived-in detail.

  * grade_story_wc_13.txt (grade=6.7)
    The "Giant's Nap" and rooftop canals create a distinct, surreal atmosphere that grounds the piece effectively. Sensory details like the "interrupted cadence" and "towers leaned like sentinels" establish a strong, cohesive sense of place.

  * grade_story_wc_130.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is atmospheric but suffers from spatial confusion; a "cavern" usually implies an enclosure, yet the "moon's pale gaze" is visible. If it is an open cenote, the "no wind" detail fights the open-air logic. The sensory details are competent but standard.

  * grade_story_wc_131.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory details like the cold grate and the smell of lemon oil ground the scene effectively. The atmosphere is consistent, though reliance on standard tropes ("shadows... like fingers," "dust motes") prevents a higher score for uniqueness.

  * grade_story_wc_132.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory details like "warm wax" and the "mossy trellis" effectively ground the magical elements in a tangible reality. The "storm season" provides a cohesive atmospheric container, though the setting serves more as mood lighting than a source of physical obstacles or tactical constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_133.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmospheric details like "slick trails of salt" and "preserved peaches" effectively ground the setting. The environment mirrors the protagonist's isolation, though the abstract description "walls patched with tar and hope" briefly breaks immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_134.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sensory details like singing stalactites and pulsing quartz create a vivid atmosphere. The "bright darkness" motif frames the setting well, though the oxymoron feels slightly repetitive by the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_135.txt (grade=7.4)
    Sensory details are vivid and effective, establishing a specific atmosphere ("fractured light," "scent of wet stone and distant cooking fires"). The setting of the ivory harbor feels lived-in and anchors the tone well, though the "ocean-spray archivist" elements could be more deeply integrated into the action.

  * grade_story_wc_136.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is atmospheric, with effective sensory details like the constellation-etched manhole and the smell of ozone. The urban fantasy aesthetic is vivid, though occasionally marred by slightly generic descriptors ("starlit vault," "waking beast") that dampen specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_137.txt (grade=5.4)
    While the setting is established, it relies on atmospheric generalizations ("salt-laden wind," "shimmered faintly") rather than specific, tangible textures that would ground the tower in reality. The description creates a generic "mystical ruin" mood but lacks the sensory distinctiveness required to elevate the environment into a constraint or character.

  * grade_story_wc_138.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit slightly generic, sci-fantasy imagery ("fractured light," "crystalline structure"). While the environment reacts to the plot (trembling walls), the sensory details often lean into purple prose rather than specific, grounded textures that constrain character choices.

  * grade_story_wc_139.txt (grade=8.0)
    The "formaldehyde and old roses" opening efficiently establishes a sensory clash that mirrors the story's themes of death and vitality. The physical grounding of the ink pot—"cool and smooth," "shifting like oil"—anchors the magical elements in tactile reality. The setting effectively pressures the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_14.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is vivid but ornamental; "bonsai forests" creates a surreal image but functions only as a backdrop, never constraining movement or forcing a tactical choice. Sensory details are often filtered through similes ("shimmered like captured sunlight") rather than presented as immediate, tangible experience. The lack of spatial grounding makes the "labyrinth" feel generic.

  * grade_story_wc_140.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the shipping containers as a shifting, tidal labyrinth provide excellent atmospheric pressure and thematic mirroring. The tide mechanics concretely affect what is revealed, grounding the surreal premise in physical logic.

  * grade_story_wc_141.txt (grade=5.5)
    Atmospheric details like "salt-laced wind" and "damp stone" clash fatally with the presence of a pristine, playable cello, creating a breach in verisimilitude. The physical rules of the setting bend to accommodate the plot, undermining the reality of the observatory.

  * grade_story_wc_142.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting of Carnivale is visually evocative with decent contrasts between the wooden raft and neon gentrification. However, the environment serves mostly as a backdrop; specific physical details of the raft do not constrain the protagonist's tactical choices in the final scene.

  * grade_story_wc_143.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with grounded sensory details like the static-clinging dust and scanner readouts creating a vivid lunar texture. The blend of high-tech gear and the "relic" camera is slightly jarring but acceptable within the nostalgic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_144.txt (grade=6.0)
    Atmospheric details like mist, salt, and machine oil are vivid and effectively set a mood of industrial decay. However, the "water feature" interaction breaks verisimilitude by requiring a blind character to interpret visual light refraction. This specific detail undermines the otherwise grounded sensory environment.

  * grade_story_wc_145.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the cold is tactile and active, directly influencing the method (condensation) and the atmosphere. Specific details like the rusted beams and the "forgotten thought" simile establish a cohesive, melancholic mood that anchors the abstract quest.

  * grade_story_wc_146.txt (grade=6.7)
    Auditory details like the "humming like a held breath" and the rhythmic "click-click" effectively ground the tuning ritual. However, the atmosphere is diluted by worn descriptors ("silent as tombs," "color of old bruises") that flatten the setting's distinctiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_147.txt (grade=8.3)
    The atmospheric description is the story's strongest asset, effectively evoking the "salt-laced dark" and the oppressive weight of the "hush." The sensory details ("tasted of old incense and forgotten vows") ground the supernatural elements in a tangible reality, enhancing immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_148.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmosphere is distinct and sensory ("tasted of copper and old pennies"), grounding the mythic elements in physical reality. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, particularly through the "hush" which feels like a tangible presence in the lighthouse.

  * grade_story_wc_149.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmospheric details ("silver breath," "curtain of smoke") effectively establish a gothic mood and ground the scene. However, the "alchemical" descriptor remains a surface-level label that doesn't influence the physics or mechanics of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_15.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "woven" chamber offering a strong, surreal specific. Sensory details (salt, orchid, stone) are effective, though the environment functions more as a magical guide than a source of constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_150.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and specific, effectively blending the necropolis and orchard concepts ("roots weaving between ribs," "pomegranate trees"). The environment actively guides the protagonist's actions ("letting the roots guide me") and physically manifests the restoration at the climax, integrating well with the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_151.txt (grade=7.8)
    The atmospheric details of the arcade are the story's strongest element, successfully blending "predawn haze" with "neon" and "vintage cabinets" to create a specific mood. The setting actively supports the "golden light" clue. However, the opening description ("cathedral of forgotten dreams") leans into abstraction rather than grounded sensory pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=5.2)
    The cobalt observatory provides a decent anchor, but the setting details lean on generic fantasy tropes ("aged parchment," "dimly lit tavern"). While sensory details are present, they rarely constrain the character's choices or create obstacles. The "eternal candle" adds atmosphere but functions more as furniture than a tool that impacts the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is active and atmospheric, with the condensation on the boardwalk serving as a clever, specific mechanism for the spirits' communication. The "mangrove roots twisted like fingers" imagery creates immediate mood, though the specific simile is somewhat standard. The environment successfully pressures the protagonist’s choices.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=7.6)
    The sensory environment is strong, with "damp stone" and "antiseptic" grounding the reader effectively in the atrium. However, the juxtaposition of "green zone" realism with the high-fantasy ending creates a jarring tonal dissonance. The setting successfully pressures the mood but doesn't offer enough concrete constraints to force hard choices.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=6.1)
    Atmosphere is established with competence ("century-old fog," "crumbling wall"), anchoring the reader in the ruined district. However, the descriptions rely heavily on familiar tropes ("skeletal apple trees," "liquid gold") rather than fresh, specific sensory details that constrain the protagonist's options.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is the story's standout feature, blending the tactile constraints of the scaffold with the auditory expanse of the "sound wave garden" to create a unique atmosphere. Sensory details are sharp and purposeful, particularly the descriptions of the mural's transformation ("pliable as wet clay") and the garden's mechanical responsiveness.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=7.4)
    The greenhouse is rendered with strong, specific sensory details ("lenses fogging," "living metronome," "vines trained to curl"). The physical environment palpably contrasts with the abstract threat of the "thought tax" regime.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "gargantuan shell" is an excellent, imaginative setting that actively shapes the narrative through the "pinhole camera" projections. The environment is not just a backdrop but a participant that reflects the protagonist's internal state. The sensory details ("tasted of brine," "swirls of violet and gold") are vivid and establish a strong, cohesive atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmospheric setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, sensory-rich details like the glass orchids and opal towers. However, the middle section lists "deserted marvels" in a way that feels slightly catalogue-like, stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=7.1)
    The atmospheric description of the archive ("mausoleum of extinct syllables") is the story's strength, establishing a solid mood. However, physical details sometimes falter (fogging a small ink well with breath suggests awkward proximity) or rely on generic fantasy markers ("unnatural iridescence").

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting of the amphitheater inside a volcano is vivid and atmospheric, grounding the story effectively. The imagery of the building breathing connects well to the pacing, though the "whispering gears" is a slight cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=7.5)
    The attic setting is atmospherically rendered with specific sensory details ("smelled of yellowed paper," "warped floorboards"). The spatial anchoring is solid, though the dust motes do heavy lifting for the "magical" ambience.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "drifting prism terrace" is a vivid, atmospheric setting that effectively mirrors the protagonist's fractured internal state. The sensory details ("jagged rainbows," "wood... warm, almost alive") are strong, though the environment feels somewhat isolated (a "white room" effect) until the specific interaction with the bench grain grounds it.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting relies on generic bioluminescent tropes ("ghostly glow," "pulsed") without specific, tactile grounding or unique physical laws. The "landscape astrologer" element is treated as ornamental decoration and does not inform the protagonist's perception of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting leans heavily on adjectival stacking (&quot;iridescent,&quot; &quot;bioluminescent,&quot; &quot;crystal&quot;) creating a visual wash that feels ornamental. While the tunnel narrows, the environment functions largely as a static backdrop rather than a force that actively constrains tactics or forces trade-offs.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=7.7)
    The "tidal arcade" is vivid and atmospheric, grounding the scene with strong sensory details like the "ribcage of salt-bleached wood" and the lapping water. The setting actively supports the mood, though it yields too easily to the protagonist's needs.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "twilight garden" provides a coherent atmospheric backdrop with specific sensory details ("salt-laced breeze," "moss-slick stones"). However, the setting primarily functions as a mood board rather than offering constraints or tools that shape the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=6.3)
    The atmospheric details of the "skeletal cathedral" and the "prism atrium" are evocative, though the structure's massive presence contradicts the idea that Elias ignored it for thirty years. Sensory grounding in the "scent of salt and old paper" is effective. However, the setting primarily serves as a backdrop for the vision rather than a source of constraints or resources that shape Elias's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is established, but the description leans heavily on clichés like "liquid mercury" and "shattered dreams," which flatten the specificity. The environment sets a mood but does not physically constrain the characters' choices or tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=5.7)
    The setting is atmospherically described ("bioluminescent glow," "tide-polished quartz") but functions primarily as a static backdrop for decoration. The environment does not exert pressure or constrain the protagonist's choices in a meaningful way.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospherically established but leans on purple prose ("veins of a forgotten god", "silent reverence"); sensory details are vivid but often filtered through generic mystery markers rather than a unique POV bias.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sensory details of the terrace—wet stone, jasmine, the prism’s refraction—are vivid and ground the ethereal concepts well. However, the phrase "perceptively calm" appears to be a diction error (likely meant "perceptibly" or "preternaturally"), which breaks immersion in a piece relying on precise atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmospheric details like the lightning-struck ebony clipboard and the scent of jasmine provide a strong visual anchor. However, the celestial alignment and terrace setting function primarily as ornamental backdrops rather than environmental constraints that pressure the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=7.8)
    Sensory detail is vivid and atmospheric ("polished boots sinking slightly," "crystalline crust"), effectively grounding the surreal premise. The setting acts as a reflection of the protagonist's internal state, though the constraint it places on him is minimal beyond the mood.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy tropes ("silver courtyard," "shattered glass," "prism") that provide atmosphere but do not pressure the character. The environment is static decoration rather than a constraint that forces specific tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=6.4)
    The radar dome is a compelling, specific vessel for the story's acoustic focus ("swallowed sound," "creak of metal"). However, the sensory logic slips: a rusted, coastal ruin smelling of "old paper and lamp oil" feels like a generic library trope pasted onto the setting rather than an organic detail of the environment or Liora's presence.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is strong and consistent, effectively using sensory details like the stacked stones and mist; however, the "suspended between earth and sky" location blurs orientation slightly without adding necessary pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=6.3)
    The visual details of the rope and punch card are specific and grounding, but the "icebound sanctum" remains spatially vague. The setting suffers from pathetic fallacy at the climax ("aurora pulsed brighter... in approval"), which reduces the environment to a mood ring rather than a tangible constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is established with vivid, if slightly standard, "nature reclaiming ruins" imagery. Sensory details like the "scent of wet earth" and "brittle wax" work well. The atmosphere leans heavily into the ethereal, though the magical elements undercut the physical grounding of the bunker.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmosphere is palpable, leveraging specific sensory details like "cedar oil," "lapis lazuli," and "smoldering pyres" to anchor the transition between regimes. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, contrasting the crude noise of the new order with the heavy, ritualistic silence of the old, effectively raising the stakes of the intrusion.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "Soundless Sanctuary" is established with active, sensory details ("walls breathing," "floor tilting") that create a distinct atmosphere. However, the setting's "shifting" nature feels standard for the genre and does not force specific tactical trade-offs beyond general disorientation.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is vivid and distinct; the "glass mountain" and "ruined orchard district" provide tangible, atmospheric constraints that shape the character's physical journey. The sensory details of fog and frost effectively ground the surreal elements in a specific texture.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with specific sensory details like "skeletal rafters" and "moss-covered pew" effectively grounding the atmosphere. The orchard-cathedral fusion is vivid and establishes a distinct mood that supports the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=6.7)
    The "astral orchard" and "pistachio shell" offer distinct, imaginative visuals that ground the story effectively. However, descriptors like "humming" blossoms and "dim light" drift into standard magical realism tropes without fresh sensory specificity to sharpen the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is atmospheric, though the opening simile ("spines of books instead of trees") is visually confusing on a literal level. While the "shifting" nature of the library is established, it functions as generic background texture rather than a specific spatial constraint that forces unique tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=7.5)
    The atmospheric detailing of the *Mariposa* is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory specifics like the "rusted hull" and "clown faces" grounding the surrealism. The setting actively mirrors the protagonist's internal state, though the "Garden" itself remains somewhat abstract in its description ("vines made of whispered names").

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with specific tactile details like the "worn smooth" brass handle and the "cracked" wax seal anchoring the scene. The atmosphere of the mechanism room is distinct and grounded, though the description occasionally leans into purple prose ("weight of centuries"). The rope acts as a strong prop that bridges setting and plot.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmospheric details of the sonic caves ("distant chimes," "shifting hues") effectively ground the premise. The setting actively pressures the character through sound and vibration, though some descriptors lean on standard fantasy imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid acoustic and tactile details ("walls singing," "alkali crust") that ground the fantasy elements. The "glass humming pavilion" feels physically distinct and constrains the character's experience effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and active; the "whispering forecourt" and "fog bridge" constrain action and drive the realization. Atmospheric consistency is a major strength.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "blooming fortress" concept is vivid and atmospheric, providing a strong container for the action. However, some descriptors lean on standard fantasy tropes (brittle wicks, damp earth) rather than highly specific, idiosyncratic details that would ground the setting further.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.0)
    The grotto is established with vivid, atmospheric detail that grounds the magical realism. The sensory details ("lacework of salt crystals," "silt") effectively support the mood, though the opening description is somewhat dense with stacked metaphors.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is lush and functional; the "xenial lattice" and "inverted world" are not just backdrops but active constraints on movement and survival. Sensory details like the "taste of ozone" and "honey left too long" ground the fantastical elements in a lived, physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "drifting prism terrace" and "storm glass" provide vivid, specific imagery that anchors the fantasy setting. However, the lighting contradiction (sunlight vs. twilight/night) disrupts the physical logic of the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=5.7)
    Imagery relies on standard high-fantasy adjectives ("kaleidoscopic," "prismatic," "bioluminescent") that create a generic, shiny veneer without tactile grounding. The environment is a passive backdrop until the paint-peeling interaction, which is the only specific tactile moment.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=6.2)
    The "ashen charcoal sanctuary" provides a distinct visual anchor, and the pathetic fallacy of the walls darkening adds atmosphere. However, descriptors often lean into generic fantasy phrasing ("starlight spilled like silver dust," "pale as moonlight"), reducing specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is vivid and distinct; the juxtaposition of the damp, organic mushroom farm with the ozone-smelling, glitching quantum machinery creates a unique atmosphere. The sensory details ("glowing mycelium mats," "damp earth") effectively ground the surreal events in a tangible reality.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=4.6)
    Atmospheric descriptors like "sepia reading room" and "golden shadows" set a mood, but the "bridge of intuition" is spatially confusing—described as a plank between shelves yet acting as a complex machine. The physical reality of the scene dissolves into vague magical effects ("air around him shimmered") that obscure rather than ground the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=6.3)
    The greenhouse atmosphere is established with decent sensory detail, though it leans toward generic dark fantasy ("sky that had forgotten dawn"). The integration of the required phrase "factually mystical" is jarring and breaks the immersive tone of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting relies on archival clichés ("yellowed paper," "old glue") rather than specific, sensory engagement. The "dust patterns" concept is abstract and treated as a metaphor rather than a grounded, observable detail that drives the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=6.8)
    The opening image of the "auric lagoon" and the concept of "puddle maps" are vivid and atmospheric. However, the server room description ("humming servers," "dead screens") falls into generic sci-fi shorthand. The transition from the magical exterior to the mundane tech interior feels texturally disjointed.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=5.8)
    Sensory details are vivid ("bioluminescent moss," "prismatic light") but often rely on generic atmospheric tropes ("something like memory"). The spatial confusion between the atrium and the grotto undermines the grounding, making the setting feel like a floating construct rather than a tangible place.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=6.0)
    The atmosphere is cohesive but relies on generic fantasy signifiers ("skeletal hand," "whispered secrets") rather than concrete, grounding details. The "skyborne" nature of the arbor is mentioned as a label but does not influence the physics, verticality, or constraints of the scene, leaving the setting feeling like a painted backdrop rather than a lived-in space.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=5.8)
    The workshop and greenhouse are rendered with functional sensory details ("oil and rust," "cracked glass"), though the "clockwork city" leans on generic steampunk tropes. The setting serves the plot but does not deeply constrain choices or mirror the internal state beyond standard pathetic fallacy.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=7.2)
    The foundry setting is atmospheric and mirrors the internal state, though it leans on stock imagery ("skeletal fingers," "bruised twilight"). The physical details of the coin and anvil provide necessary tactile grounding amidst the adjectival density.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmospheric description of Echo Gorge is vivid and effectively establishes a melancholic tone. The sensory details ("scent of wet stone," "misaligned harp") ground the scene well, though they function more as a backdrop than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=6.5)
    The ultraviolet forest is atmospheric and vivid, with sensory details like the smell of ozone and the "blood left to dry" establishing a strong mood. However, the visual of equations floating in the air pushes the imagery into cliché, detracting from the otherwise grounded surrealism.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric; details like the "suspended stalls," "rope bridges," and the "barnacle-encrusted" voice ground the magical elements in specific sensory textures. The verticality of the market and the "drowned" imagery in the painting successfully establish a cohesive, immersive world.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like the smell of sawdust and caramel corn and the specific accumulation of dust. The atmosphere of the "skeletal" circus district is palpable and effectively grounds the supernatural elements.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "glass orchard" and "liquid silver" imagery creates a vivid, specific atmosphere that anchors the fable. The setting details (translucent covers, frost patterns) effectively ground the surreal premise, though the descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "baroque asteroid" and "visible threads of time" create a vivid, atmospheric container for the action. The sensory details of the storm and the archive's architecture effectively ground the metaphysical stakes. The environment actively pressures the characters, particularly through the time storm.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=5.9)
    Sensory details ("smelled of oil," "brass walls") ground the scene effectively, though the description leans into generic "scars of time" metaphors that reduce specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmospheric writing is the standout strength, with "broken teeth" smokestacks and "damp musk" creating a tangible, eerie world. The sensory details of the cave and the "walls slick with calcite" effectively ground the fantasy elements.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=6.7)
    Atmospheric imagery ("clawed the sky," "smelled of ozone") is vivid and establishes a cohesive tone. However, the setting functions primarily as a static backdrop for the "tour" rather than offering physical constraints that pressure the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=5.5)
    Vivid sensory details like the stained glass are undermined by the impossible simultaneity of autumn and a late-winter thaw in a single evening.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=3.8)
    The zeppelin library is a jarring, ornamental addition that clashes with the grounded historical setting and affects no choices. The lagoon is atmospheric but generic, functioning only as a magical plot device.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting details—the "gold-hued glass," "silt of the old docks," and "paper lanterns"—are vivid and effectively establish a melancholic atmosphere. The sensory specificity grounds the fable-like tone well, though the transition to the magical ending feels less grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the juxtaposition of the ancient orchard and the steel skyscraper grounding the fantastical elements effectively. Imagery like roots drinking from hidden aquifers creates a vivid, specific atmosphere that supports the theme, though the "velvet disquiet" is occasionally disrupted by the narrator's explanations.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is established clearly, but relies on familiar genre tropes ("cathedral of ice," "scattered diamonds") rather than fresh, specific sensory details. The contrast between the frozen atrium and the lush greenhouse vision is the strongest visual element, grounding the magic in a tangible shift.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=7.8)
    Strong sensory grounding with the "scent of ozone" and the specific detail of the copper wire woven into the rope. The setting effectively pressures the protagonist, though some descriptors ("sleeping serpents") lean toward standard atmospherics.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=6.5)
    Atmosphere is established with some competence, though it leans on genre clichés ("ozone and old parchment," "scavenged metal"). The lantern glass is a solid anchor, but the "edge of the world" setting feels like a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that constrains the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is atmospheric, establishing the "skeletal" wasteland effectively. However, the imagery relies on familiar tropes ("sun bled," "cracked earth") and does not deeply constrain the protagonist's choices beyond providing a backdrop for his isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=5.5)
    The silo provides a decent initial anchor, but the garage sale locations lack spatial specificity or atmosphere. Sensory details tend toward the generic ("scent of rain," "thickened into honey," "cracked ice") rather than idiosyncratic, character-filtered observations.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is vivid but leans heavily on ornamental description ("hammered metal," "shattered stained glass") that feels static. The personification of the water ("warmly attentive patience") pushes into pathetic fallacy, reducing the environment to a mirror for the protagonist's emotions rather than a distinct place.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with "living stone pillars" and "humming" creating a distinct, atmospheric sense of place. The environment actively grounds the protagonist's history, though the specific mechanics of the "grown stone" could be more integrated into the immediate action.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=7.6)
    Atmosphere is a strength, with specific sensory details ("wet earth," "moss," "fly amber") effectively grounding the speculative elements in a tactile reality. The setting actively contributes to the mood, though it stops short of constraining the protagonist's tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=7.2)
    The superimposition of the jetty over the forgotten battlefield creates a strong, specific sense of place. While atmospheric, some details lean on standard literary tropes ("scent of salt," "cry of a gull") rather than fresh, character-specific observation.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=6.3)
    Atmosphere is established through consistent grim imagery ("rusted carcass," "wax prison"), though it leans on generic wasteland tropes. Specific sensory details like the "scent of damp earth" work well, but the environment serves largely as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or tactical constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with specific details like "ribbons of light" and the "warped" glass grounding the time dilation concept physically. The atmosphere is vivid, though occasionally it leans into static description rather than interacting dynamically with the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "wrong sky" and "void where stars should have been" create a vivid, distinct atmosphere. The environment feels tangible, though the "sacredly playful" descriptor is an abstract stumble in an otherwise grounded setting.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on abstract metaphors ("vein of forgotten breath") rather than concrete, sensory grounding; the physical reality of the gallery is obscured by the poetic overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=7.9)
    The setting of the mountain-bookstore is vivid and atmospheric ("impossible geometry," "shelves carved into shelves"), effectively grounding the surreal premise. The sensory details ("taste of rain on stone," "smell of damp earth") create a cohesive texture that supports the story's dreamlike tone.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    The "woven hush" and the temperature-shifting labyrinth create a tactile, immersive atmosphere that actively constrains the protagonist. The setting details are purposeful and distinct, though the score is capped by the Q2 gate as the plot mechanics are slightly less integrated than the atmospheric elements.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid imagery like "jagged ivory curves" and "fractured whispers" effectively grounding the fantasy. The environment actively participates in the plot (reacting to words), though some descriptions veer into generic atmospheric tropes ("long-dead god," "perpetual haze").

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting (acid sea, rusting workshop) is atmospherically consistent and establishes a clear tone. However, the environment functions mostly as a backdrop; the "gears" and "acid" provide texture but do not constrain specific tactics or force choices until the magic resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.5)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the bioluminescence, damp stone, and "breath of the earth" create a vivid, dreamlike texture. The environment actively constrains the protagonist, particularly the water that renders the shell elusive. The sensory details are consistent and support the mythic tone without becoming cluttered.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=7.3)
    Atmospheric details are vivid ("cobalt," "salt and wind") and ground the scene well. However, descriptions occasionally drift into purple prose ("bled into the sky," "promise of rain") rather than strictly constraining choice.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is visually cohesive but relies on post-apocalyptic stock imagery ("skeletal frame," "graveyard of dials," "rusted girders"). While the "dried sea" provides atmosphere, the environment remains a static backdrop rather than an active constraint or pressure cooker for the scene's action.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.4)
    The hanging orchard and ravine are vivid, specific, and atmospheric, serving as a strong physical anchor for the abstract themes. The setting actively mirrors the internal state (roots holding on amidst storms), integrating well with the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=6.3)
    The atmosphere is consistent but relies heavily on stock gothic imagery ("mist that curled like ghostly fingers," "bruised sky"). While the "opal dock" is a distinct image, the sensory details often feel decorative rather than constraining the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=6.4)
    The shop's atmosphere is grounded and evocative ("ink faded to the color of old tea"), though the cavern relies on generic fantasy tropes. The rising water effectively integrates environmental pressure into the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory details are vivid ("cobalt moss," "lanterns flickering"), creating a cohesive atmospheric tone. However, the setting primarily functions as a backdrop rather than a source of constraint or active pressure on the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory details like "charred cedar and ozone" establish a vivid atmosphere, though "molten copper" is a somewhat standard descriptor. The setting provides mood but does not significantly constrain the characters' tactical choices or force specific physical interactions beyond holding the shell.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and purposeful, with the "scarred pine," "mountain's shadow," and "glimmer of birch" grounding the surreal elements. The cabin feels lived-in and functions as a constraint on the character's isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmospheric details are the story's strength, effectively grounding the reader in the "hush" of the shop. The sensory shift from smell to touch is well-rendered ("tracing the grooves as if reading braille"). However, the water clock elements feel somewhat ornamental, serving as a soundscape rather than a mechanical constraint on the action.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=7.3)
    Sensory details like the "cool moss," "black snow," and the specific behavior of the ink create a vivid atmosphere. The setting helps anchor the tone, though the "floating" aspect of the platform functions more as a backdrop than a constraint on the action.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the sensory details of the archive ("yellowed paper," "old glue") and the orchard creating a strong texture. The object work—specifically the perfume bottle and the copper wire—grounds the metaphysical stakes in concrete reality effectively. The atmosphere supports the tone well.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=5.0)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on generic high-fantasy tropes ("ribs of a forgotten god," "dust motes") that do not constrain the character's choices. The "hiccup" is a distinct visual, but the library itself functions largely as a static backdrop rather than a tool or obstacle. The environment dissolves into a void at the end, bypassing the potential for using the temple's specific geography to drive the resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with strong imagery like the "barnacle on whalebone" and the "monstrous thing of water" anchoring the fabulist premise. The physical environment actively pressures the character (the wavering horizon, the hissing pipes), integrating well with the stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is established with vivid sensory details ("violet and blue light," "damp caverns") that effectively ground the atmosphere. The bioluminescence serves the theme of permeability well, though the environment functions largely as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and tactile, with "wet parchment" and "stone steps" grounding the scene effectively. The specific lighting of the mica-pane lanterns is well-integrated into the plot, though the specific "clover" description later feels semantically jarring.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=8.8)
    The utility tunnel is rendered with vivid, claustrophobic details ("damp concrete," "fogged Plexiglas") that mirror Mara’s internal state. While some descriptions lean on familiar tropes ("city’s pulse"), the glass harmonica serves as an excellent micro-setting object that anchors the final beat.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=7.6)
    Sensory details like the warm wood, salt, and sea lavender effectively ground the scene and support the mood. The "blooming jetty" offers a specific, vivid image that anchors the abstract emotions. The setting actively participates in the mood, though it doesn't strictly constrain the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is grounded with distinct sensory details like "damp stone" and the "humming" moon rock, effectively supporting the mood. While some descriptions lean slightly purple ("green waterfalls"), the environment successfully constrains the mood and focuses the interaction.

  * grade_story_wc_245.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "ultrasonic forest" is a vivid, specific environment that shapes the protagonist's sensory experience and movement. The details of vibration and frequency effectively ground the fantasy elements, though the "air thickened like honey" simile is a slight cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_246.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is atmospheric and purposeful; the "bruise-colored" anomaly and the "dried-up fountain" create a distinct mood. The environment actively shapes the possibility space (the shimmering air allowing reality distortion), integrating well with the plot.

  * grade_story_wc_247.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on atmospheric clichés ("scattered silver," "light danced," "lapping waves") rather than specific, grounding details. While the harbor is present, it feels like a generic backdrop for the mood rather than a distinct place exerting pressure on the characters. The sensory details are purely visual and auditory, lacking tactile grit.

  * grade_story_wc_248.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting of the scorched archive is established with functional sensory details like "scorched parchment" and "ash." However, descriptors like "archway of stars" and "ruins of the lost civilization" lean toward generic fantasy tropes rather than specific, lived-in textures that constrain the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_249.txt (grade=7.5)
    The "sound wave garden" and "auric lagoon" are vivid, specific concepts that effectively ground the story's surreal tone. In contrast, the laboratory setting relies on generic tropes (sterile glow, scribbling scientists) that lack the same textural distinctiveness. The atmospheric shift from sterile lab to resonant garden is well-handled.

  * grade_story_wc_25.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and distinct, with sensory details like "static in his gloves" and containers leaning "like drunkards" effectively building atmosphere. The labyrinth directly constrains movement and shapes the puzzle, making the environment essential rather than just a backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_250.txt (grade=7.4)
    The dental mirror and shutters provide specific, tactile grounding that anchors the scene well, though the "bruised evening sky" is a generic descriptor that limits the atmospheric ceiling.

  * grade_story_wc_251.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "cobalt library" is an evocative setting, and details like the "prismatic shadows" and "cool marble" firmly ground the magical realism tone. The atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, though the "magnetic grotto" functions more as a distant backstory label than a tangible, pressure-exerting environment in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_252.txt (grade=6.1)
    Port Veyra and the island are atmospherically rendered, though descriptions like "thick with salt" and "twisted trees" lean on genre standards. The setting facilitates the plot but rarely constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_253.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is atmospheric, with the turbines serving as effective, oppressive sentinels that constrain the mood. The "happiness mandate" context is sketched efficiently, though the "dried flowers" description contains a minor logic bump (described as a "bouquet" but also "pressed himself," which typically implies flattening rather than standing in a vase).

  * grade_story_wc_254.txt (grade=6.1)
    Atmosphere is vivid and cohesive ("cobalt atrium," "quartz colonnade"), establishing a distinct mood. However, the setting serves primarily as a backdrop for lyrical description rather than a source of constraint or resources that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=7.8)
    The sensory details—molten silica, damp earth, the heat of the shard—are vivid and ground the courtyard effectively. The setting is the strongest element, providing texture that the plot somewhat lacks.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric detail is strong and immersive ("jars holding a whisper," "shattered glass orbs"), successfully grounding the abstract concept in sensory reality. The setting remains the story's most distinct and successful feature.

  * grade_story_wc_257.txt (grade=6.7)
    The observatory is rendered with strong, atmospheric specificity ("brass gears frozen," "dust motes"), establishing a solid mood. However, the subsequent locations (library, shop) pass by too quickly to feel grounded, and the "blurring stars"—a potentially major world-building element—feel decorative rather than integral to the plot's reality.

  * grade_story_wc_258.txt (grade=7.6)
    The physical loft is standard, but the "micro-setting" of the cards is excellent—the static lantern and shifting ink create a vivid, surreal atmosphere. The skylight provides a rhythmic backdrop that effectively paces the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_259.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with vivid imagery ("obsidian walls," "bioluminescent moss") establishing a clear atmosphere. However, the introduction of "atoms of nostalgia" as a physical force muddies the world logic, hovering uncomfortably between sci-fi and pure magic without establishing firm rules.

  * grade_story_wc_26.txt (grade=6.5)
    Sensory details like "sky bruised from blue to violet" and "spilled ink" establish a vivid atmosphere. The setting interacts with the plot (vines trembling), though elements like silver vines feeling slightly standard for the genre.

  * grade_story_wc_260.txt (grade=7.1)
    Sensory details like "damp earth," "oil lamp," and "moth wings" effectively ground the atmosphere. The setting mirrors the protagonist's internal state well, though the description of the workshop as a "sanctuary" is a familiar trope.

  * grade_story_wc_261.txt (grade=7.5)
    Sensory details in the garden are vivid and immersive, effectively using the "frost" and "shattered glass" imagery to set a cold, sharp tone. The atmosphere of the tower at dawn is palpable, though the underground chamber feels spatially generic compared to the specificity of the garden. The "meteor hush" tone is successfully sustained through the silence and whispering stones.

  * grade_story_wc_262.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset; the booth is rendered with specific, evocative sensory details ("smell of celluloid," "brittle and yellowed"). The atmosphere successfully grounds the magical elements in a tangible, dusty reality.

  * grade_story_wc_263.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy markers ("emerald and violet ribbons," "ancient trees") that create a visual tableau but lack tactile specificity or distinct rules. While atmospheric, the environment serves as a static backdrop rather than a pressure cooker that constrains the protagonist's options.

  * grade_story_wc_264.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the imagery is coherent, the settings ("glowing dune," "shelves that stretched into infinity") are genre standards that serve as passive backdrops rather than active constraints. Sensory details like "ozone and old paper" are stock shorthand for magical archives and do not force the character to adapt his physical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_265.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "mechanical rainforest" with its copper leaves and groaning gears is a vivid, specific image that grounds the opening. However, the setting becomes increasingly abstract ("trees were neither metal nor wood") and ceases to constrain the character's actions, serving only as a backdrop for the epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_266.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "Veiled Ridgeway" and the cove provide a competent atmospheric backdrop with sensory details like "violet glow" and "damp earth." However, the setting acts primarily as scenery for the dialogue rather than a source of pressure or constraint that forces character choices.

  * grade_story_wc_267.txt (grade=6.8)
    Atmospherics are vivid ("choked with snow"), but the spatial logic of the rust streak breaks the reality of the setting. The fortress feels like a generic dystopian backdrop rather than a specific constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_268.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with vivid sensory details like "warped wooden shelves" and "ink bloom like a bruise" grounding the setting. The ancient library feels tangible, though some descriptive flourishes ("shoulders of an old king") lean toward the ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_269.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strength, with effective sensory details like the “scent of salt and old paper” and the “hum of machinery.” The setting effectively constrains the protagonist, grounding the narrative in the station’s isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_27.txt (grade=6.3)
    The juxtaposition of the rusted spaceport and the ancient stone circle creates a vivid, specific atmosphere. Sensory details like "ozone and wildflowers" work well to ground the scene. However, some descriptors lean into cliché ("groaned under the weight of forgotten time," "whispering secrets"), which blunts the distinctiveness of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_270.txt (grade=6.2)
    Sensory details like "scent of sulfur" and "obsidian rock" ground the scene adequately, establishing a consistent atmosphere. However, the description remains within standard genre conventions without unique, choice-constraining specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_271.txt (grade=8.4)
    The sensory environment is the story's strongest asset; the "glass panes fogged with salt" and the vibrating terrarium ground the abstract themes in concrete reality. The orchid responding to the drone vibration is an excellent, specific detail that anchors the setting to the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_272.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting provides strong atmospheric details like "sagging shelves" and "damp" cards, establishing a vivid gothic mood. However, the fluid, magical realism of the breathing walls unmoors the physical reality too early, reducing the library to a psychological projection rather than a grounded place.

  * grade_story_wc_273.txt (grade=6.0)
    The "wind-carved encampment" and "scavenged solar film" provide vivid visual texture, establishing a clear atmosphere. However, the setting remains a passive backdrop; it does not constrain Elias's movement or force tactical trade-offs during the crisis.

  * grade_story_wc_274.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is atmospheric but relies on some mixed abstract/concrete descriptions ("scent of ozone and old secrets") that reduce specificity. The "cryogenic library" concept is established, but physical details like "vaulted ceilings" and "shadows stretched long" are standard.

  * grade_story_wc_275.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory details like the "air tasted of rust" and the "twin suns" effectively ground the sci-fi setting, though the glass dome is a familiar trope. The environment functions well as a crucible for the scene, physically enclosing the characters. The setting description is vivid but does not deeply constrain the tactical options beyond mere proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_276.txt (grade=8.0)
    The sound wave garden is a vivid, specific environment that actively shapes the protagonist's movement (the zigzag). The concept of reeds transliterating emotion is integrated well into the physical action, grounding the surreal premise in tactile detail.

  * grade_story_wc_277.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is atmospheric and well-drawn, using sensory details like "gaslight," "iron gall," and the "brass eyepiece" to ground the gothic tone. The observatory feels like a tangible space that reflects Elara's isolation and perspective. The environment actively frames her deduction, integrating setting with plot.

  * grade_story_wc_278.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is evocative and distinct, successfully blending the analog ("rusted phonographs") with the digital ("haunted firmware") to create a specific, tactile atmosphere. The physical details of the laboratory ground the speculative elements effectively, making the "folding of time" feel plausible within the space.

  * grade_story_wc_279.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is the story’s strongest asset, actively constraining Liora’s actions through the shifting sand and humming tiles. The "lilac unease" and specific details of the grotto create a vivid, immersive atmosphere that is essential to the plot's resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_28.txt (grade=8.0)
    The setting is vivid and tactile, with the charred cedar and damp stone grounding the abstract themes. The specific focus on the tesserae and the ruined minaret effectively constrains the action, though the opening simile ("sky split like broken glass") is slightly incoherent.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=8.1)
    The atmospheric details are strong, effectively using sensory imagery ("silvered glow," "skeletal branches," "scent of ripe apples") to ground the supernatural elements. The setting transitions from the physical hedge maze to the metaphysical "echo" with clarity and vividness. However, terms like "mystic orchard garden" lean slightly generic compared to the specificity of the rest of the description.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=7.6)
    The light painting studio is a vivid, specific environment that actively shapes the narrative action and imagery. The sensory details of ozone, blacklight, and glowing paint effectively ground the metaphysical elements. The setting is the strongest component, acting as a necessary tool for the protagonist's investigation.

  * grade_story_wc_282.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid ("crumbling into the sea like forgotten teeth"), anchoring the mood effectively. The "sensory map maker" concept adds a specific, grounding texture to the environment, though the mapping process itself is more aesthetic than constraining.

  * grade_story_wc_283.txt (grade=8.1)
    Strong atmospheric grounding with specific, tactile details like the "dull black plastic disc" and the "shudder" of the hourglass. The warehouse and the buttons act as effective micro-settings that constrain attention and ground the magical elements in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_284.txt (grade=6.0)
    The atmospheric description of the mist and thaw is vivid and establishes a strong mood. However, the spatial confusion regarding the cliff versus the base, along with the implausible preservation of snow-codes, prevents the setting from feeling grounded or real. The environment serves the mood well but fails as a physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_285.txt (grade=7.1)
    The atmosphere is established effectively with sensory details like the "thickened into a growl" river. However, descriptions occasionally veer into purple prose ("shroud," "cousin of ruin") that distances the reader. The physical constraint of the fraying rope in the fog works well to ground the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_286.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering vivid anchors like the "skeletal orchard" and "bleached" wood that ground the surreal elements. However, the description leans on standard post-apocalyptic adjectives ("withered," "hollow") and the "chimney smoke" simile creates a distracting tense clash ("flattens/did blur").

  * grade_story_wc_287.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the fire escape and harbor providing a clear, atmospheric stage. Specific props like the bitting gauge anchor the scene well, though descriptions occasionally lean into standard literary tropes ("crumbling apartment," "rusting railings").

  * grade_story_wc_288.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is established with vivid imagery ("obsidian shelf," "floating like islands"), though the technical phrase "atomically reflective" creates a jarring tonal clash with the archaic atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_289.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the temple, rain, and mud are rendered with sensory specificity that grounds the abstract themes. The vivid imagery of the pond and the installation creates a cohesive, distinct atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_29.txt (grade=6.0)
    The radio station setting is anchored clearly with details like the observation booth and warning lights. However, the atmosphere relies on standard genre descriptors ("low thrum of static," "loomed outside") rather than specific, sensory-rich textures that constrain the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_290.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmosphere is strong, with "silver veins" and "damp stone" grounding the scene. The setting effectively constrains the protagonist early on, though the "impossible geometries" description leans on generic tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_291.txt (grade=4.5)
    While the atmospheric descriptions of the mist and quarry are serviceable, the setting lacks specific, grounded reality; the preservation of the ribbon defies the laws of weather and decay, breaking immersion. The "quarry" feels like a generic backdrop rather than a specific place affecting the investigation. The sensory details ("satin cool") contradict the established timeframe of a six-year-old cold case.

  * grade_story_wc_292.txt (grade=7.2)
    The setting is atmospheric and integral to the narrative, with details like "salt-warped shelves" effectively grounding the station's decay. However, the descriptions occasionally lean on familiar genre tropes ("clung to the cliffside like a dying man") rather than fresh, sensory observation.

  * grade_story_wc_293.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory details are vivid ("rusted into lace," "scent of wet stone"), anchoring the setting well. However, the core concept of a "pixelated" world feels overlayed as a visual filter rather than integrated into the physics or logic of the scene. The clash between the rustic fiddle atmosphere and the digital "low-res file" metaphor creates friction that feels more decorative than essential.

  * grade_story_wc_294.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmosphere of the abandoned train is vivid, with sensory details like the "scent of sawdust" and "peeling stripes" grounding the scene. While effective, the "detritus of dreams" imagery leans toward standard tropes for abandoned settings.

  * grade_story_wc_295.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is established with strong sensory details, such as the groaning iron ribs and the fog on the eyepiece, effectively grounding the reader. The atmosphere of "midnight solace" is palpable, though the specific mechanics of the observatory sometimes drift into generic fantasy aesthetics rather than constraining the character's physical actions.

  * grade_story_wc_296.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and functions as an active participant in the pressure cooker of the scene. The "bone mirror" is a standout detail that specifically charges the final revelation, elevating the setting beyond mere backdrop. The atmosphere remains consistently ominous.

  * grade_story_wc_297.txt (grade=5.5)
    The "cobalt glade" provides a functional atmospheric anchor, though the sensory details often lean into heavy-handed similes ("like a bruise," "like ink") that draw attention away from the immediate reality. While the setting is vivid, it acts as a static backdrop for the meeting rather than a source of constraints or resources that Elias must actively navigate.

  * grade_story_wc_298.txt (grade=8.5)
    The setting is atmospheric and active; the roots "threading through ribs" and "drinking deep" establish a grim, living environment that pressures the protagonist. The sensory details (smell of rot, tactile bark) ground the fantastical elements effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_299.txt (grade=7.6)
    The setting is established with strong sensory details like the diesel smell and the "echo valley" acoustic. The quarry environment effectively mirrors Jake's internal hollowness, though the specific location of the trailer plays a somewhat static role until he moves to the pit edge.

  * grade_story_wc_3.txt (grade=5.3)
    The "arbor above the clouds" provides a vivid visual backdrop, but the setting operates largely as a static stage rather than a source of pressure or constraint. The sensory details ("metallic alloy," "cuneiform") are evocative but do not force the protagonist to adapt her tactics or endure specific physical conditions.

  * grade_story_wc_30.txt (grade=8.2)
    The tidal atrium is the story's strongest asset, seamlessly integrating the "titan-gear" physics and the "migrating" books. Sensory details like salt-laced mist and water lapping at brass toes are vivid, purposeful, and establish a unique atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_300.txt (grade=7.0)
    Atmospheric details like "shattered quartz" and the smell of "rust and vanilla" are vivid and grounding. However, the physical reality of the "confessions etched inside a seashell’s spiral" is difficult to visualize within the bunker's industrial context, slightly weakening the setting's solidity.

  * grade_story_wc_301.txt (grade=8.1)
    The station setting is evocative, with "ivy swallowing the station" and "peeling schedule boards" creating a strong atmospheric container. The graffiti messages feel slightly too poetic for a bathroom wall, verging on authorial insertion, but they effectively drive the protagonist’s realization.

  * grade_story_wc_302.txt (grade=4.8)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy signifiers ("glowing," "mist," "parchment") that lack distinct, lived-in texture. The space feels like a "white room" populated with standard magical props rather than a specific place that constrains the character's movement or perception in a unique way.

  * grade_story_wc_303.txt (grade=7.8)
    Specific elements like the "ice crystal violin" and "coffee stains" create a vivid, tactile reality. The "velvet observatory" is an evocative concept that grounds the scene, though the mechanics of the "fabric roof" remain slightly abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_304.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is atmospheric and vivid ("shimmering curtains," "ice singing"), effectively establishing the "radiant hush" tone. However, it leans on standard high-fantasy tropes ("skyborne grotto") and functions as a static backdrop rather than a pressure-cooker that constrains the protagonist's tactical options.

  * grade_story_wc_305.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "vineyard hush" and "bruise above the clouds" offer distinct atmospheric anchors. However, elements like "bioluminescent fungi" and the floating geography of the grotto feel like generic fantasy tropes that lack specific, tactile grounding in the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_306.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and well-integrated, with the lighthouse, wind, and embers creating a consistent mood. The "wind chimes" and "mirror shard" effectively anchor the scene in physical reality. The sensory details ("scent of ash and salt") support the tone, though the environment does not strictly constrain tactical choices beyond providing the backdrop for isolation.

  * grade_story_wc_307.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is visually distinct, with the floating platform and glowing lodestone providing a clear stage. However, the description leans into stock fantasy imagery ("glassy expanse," "whispered secrets") rather than specific, grounded details that constrain the character’s choices. The "sycamore hush" adds a nice atmospheric touch.

  * grade_story_wc_308.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting ("towers of bone," "canyon of endless echoes") is vivid and atmospheric, providing a functional backdrop for the mystic tone. However, it relies heavily on standard fantasy tropes, and the spatial geography remains vague (the "nearest tower" appears when needed). The environment serves as scenery rather than a source of pressure or distinct constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_309.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with strong specific imagery like "stars that moved like schools of fish" and the "garden folly." The physical environment grounds the magical elements well, though the "black glass" courtyard is a familiar trope.

  * grade_story_wc_31.txt (grade=7.0)
    The sunken library is a compelling, specific setting that constrains movement ("slick with algae," "groaning"). The atmosphere is well-rendered with sensory details like "scent of salt and old paper," though the "airtight belly" logic is a slight suspension of disbelief hurdle.

  * grade_story_wc_310.txt (grade=7.2)
    The "ambered observatory" and "stars... like insects in honey" provide a vivid, atmospheric grounding that effectively establishes the tone. The tactile details of the coins offer a necessary physical anchor to the otherwise abstract celestial setting.

  * grade_story_wc_311.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atmosphere is competently gothic with some vivid light imagery ("jagged rainbows"). However, the setting feels like a standard "white room" filled with genre props (brass lectern, wax cylinders) rather than a specific, lived-in space that constrains the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_312.txt (grade=8.9)
    The setting is integral to the solution; the viaduct's leaks provide the specific tool (water drops) Elias needs to mend the bell. Vivid sensory details like "sapphire stone drank the light" actively charge the atmosphere and constrain the available resources.

  * grade_story_wc_313.txt (grade=4.2)
    While sensory details like the "smell of damp wood" are vivid, the setting fails the credibility standard due to the impossible preservation of fragile artifacts (paper, bibles) in a flooded ruin. This physics amnesia breaks suspension of disbelief, transforming the resurfaced town from a grounded setting into an illogical stage set.

  * grade_story_wc_314.txt (grade=6.3)
    Sensory details are present but suffer from adjective density ("kaleidoscopic," "prismatic," "liquid") that creates a "purple" effect rather than specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_315.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory details are vivid but often filtered through heavy metaphor ("cathedral," "symphony"), distancing the reader from the physical reality. The "arbor" setting is atmospheric but lacks spatial concreteness—it feels more like a symbolic space than a grounded location.

  * grade_story_wc_316.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting is functional and atmospheric but leans on standard tropes ("grooves worn by centuries," "old incense"). While the "brain in a jar" adds specificity, the environment itself does not uniquely constrain the combat or choices.

  * grade_story_wc_317.txt (grade=6.4)
    Sensory details like the "wet, tearing noise" and the "stench" are effective. However, the setting primarily serves as a backdrop for the montage rather than constraining action in real-time, until the final door-locking beat.

  * grade_story_wc_318.txt (grade=6.8)
    The physical description of the leaf blower and the tunnel is vivid, anchoring the scene well. However, the geography of the "household at the tunnel's end" is vague—audio physics implies distance, but the characters appear as if adjacent—and the acoustic transformation of engine noise into a "lullaby" is asserted rather than sensorially constructed.

  * grade_story_wc_319.txt (grade=6.0)
    The atmosphere is consistent but relies on generic fantasy signifiers ("skeletal trees," "mist," "ancient parchment"). While the "frozen garden" is established, specific sensory details are often filtered through heavy similes rather than direct interaction, creating a "dreamscape" distance that reduces immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_32.txt (grade=6.9)
    Atmosphere is established through "acid and soot" and the "violet sky," though the "ember nexus" functions as a vague fantasy prop until its final flare. The setting effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal volatility, though it lacks deep tactile specificity in the middle beats.

  * grade_story_wc_320.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting of the radio tower city over the gorge is vivid and successfully creates physical pressure. The sensory details ("rusted girders," "moonlight") effectively ground the more abstract fantastical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_321.txt (grade=5.8)
    The "spectral grotto" and "ozone and old paper" scent provide decent atmosphere, but the opening simile ("knife through silk") is a worn cliché that undermines literary ambition. The setting serves as a backdrop rather than a pressure cooker for the characters.

  * grade_story_wc_322.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "sinew thread" and "breathing walls" provide specific, vivid imagery that grounds the surrealism; however, the transition to the "void" feels somewhat generic compared to the gallery's specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_323.txt (grade=7.4)
    The benthic setting is established with evocative imagery ("corpse of coral and steel") that grounds the story effectively. Atmospheric details like the "bioluminescent visor" and "abyssal plain" create a strong sense of place. Minor physics ambiguity regarding "breath misting in the frigid water" (implying air) vs. the aquatic environment slightly blurs the orientation.

  * grade_story_wc_324.txt (grade=7.7)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with tactile details like the "cold seeping into her bones" and the "crackling" aid grounding the scene. The setting exerts clear pressure on the protagonist's senses.

  * grade_story_wc_325.txt (grade=8.4)
    Atmospheric details like the peeling insulation and pulsing gold build a pressurized, claustrophobic environment that effectively mirrors the internal tension. However, the description relies heavily on simile constructions ("like a dying whale," "thick as pythons"), which occasionally filters the sensory immediacy through comparisons rather than direct experience.

  * grade_story_wc_326.txt (grade=7.2)
    The atmospheric details of the "frozen jewel" observatory are evocative and ground the scene well. However, the visual logic wavers with the "spilled ink" on a digital monitor described as having "pixels"; the mixed media metaphor confuses the physical reality of the technology being described.

  * grade_story_wc_327.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting of the "towers of bone" and "tunnel of echoes" is vivid and imaginative, effectively grounding the story's textural focus. Sensory details ("rough as sandstone," "brittle as dried leaves") are strong, though the environment functions more as a passive backdrop than an active pressure on the protagonist.

  * grade_story_wc_328.txt (grade=8.5)
    The underground garden is vividly realized with sensory details like "damp earth," "crushed mint," and "glowing foxfire" that ground the weirdness. The setting acts as a threshold that successfully pressurizes the protagonist's experience.

  * grade_story_wc_329.txt (grade=4.1)
    The setting relies on generic, high-level descriptors ("forgotten dream," "rusted metal") rather than specific, tactile details that would constrain the protagonist's choices. The sky-bridge concept lacks spatial definition, leaving the geography of the escape and the relationship between the two worlds vague.

  * grade_story_wc_33.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, anchoring the story effectively with the "cobalt arcade" and "dying neon." The "thunderstorm in a bottle" serves as an excellent micro-setting object that mirrors the internal state. Sensory details like the cracked linoleum and tapping rain create a tangible, immersive world.

  * grade_story_wc_330.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is vivid but relies on familiar atmospheric tropes ("caramel and old magic," "ghostly echoes"). Sensory details are plentiful, but they function more as set dressing than as constraints that force the character to adapt. The environment is pliant, shifting to accommodate the protagonist rather than exerting pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_331.txt (grade=7.3)
    The atmosphere of the "scientific poetry library" is evocative, and the use of hyperbolic geometry as a portal mechanism is a strong, specific detail. However, the mention of patrons browsing at 3 AM creates a logic gap that disrupts the established solitude.

  * grade_story_wc_332.txt (grade=5.8)
    The setting is established with vivid, if conventional, "magical" imagery ("liquid amber," "ancient kapok"). While atmospheric, the description leans on flowery generalities rather than specific, tactile constraints that force character decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_333.txt (grade=5.4)
    The "shadowed nexus" and village are rendered with generic fantasy descriptors ("ancient oaks," "damp earth") that fail to constrain the action or ground the scene in a specific reality. The setting serves as a backdrop for the magic but lacks the distinct sensory details or spatial logic required to heighten the narrative.

  * grade_story_wc_334.txt (grade=9.0)
    The setting is exceptional; the "sunken orchard greenhouse" is not just scenery but a physical constraint that shapes the pacing and atmosphere (mud, tides, shattering glass). The interplay between the industrial decay (shipwrecks, greenhouse frame) and the organic magic creates a specific, memorable texture that anchors the fantasy elements.

  * grade_story_wc_335.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is vivid and active; the "shadow caught in glass" and the "shard-mirror" are excellent, specific constraints that define the magical reality. The sensory details of the library (smell, sound) effectively support the mood without stalling momentum or becoming a static catalog.

  * grade_story_wc_336.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is vivid but leans heavily on generic fantasy markers ("silver thread," "cathedral of gold") rather than specific, lived-in details. While the waterfall's runoff is used functionally for the planting, the environment largely serves as a passive backdrop for the magic rather than a source of constraint or pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_337.txt (grade=9.2)
    The "prism sanctuary" is rendered with exquisite, high-contrast sensory detail that anchors the magical realism. The atmosphere of "interlaced hush" and refracted light actively pressures the narrative, making the setting a participant in the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_338.txt (grade=7.7)
    The atmosphere is suitably damp and gothic, grounding the reader in the vault and henge. However, the repetition of "rain-scoured frescoes" in both the vault and the chapel feels repetitive rather than resonant, and the "moss and memory" descriptor strains for effect.

  * grade_story_wc_339.txt (grade=4.8)
    While atmospheric details like "silt like ash" are effective, the environment lacks physical integrity due to the impossible preservation of paper in a flooded, decades-old wreck. This oversight breaks immersion for a demanding reader, as it contradicts the rules of the established physical setting.

  * grade_story_wc_34.txt (grade=7.4)
    The atmospheric work is the story's strength, effectively blending the tactile (rust, polished wood) with the ethereal (mist, phosphorescence). The setting of the courtyard above the clouds is vivid and anchors the action well. The specific prop—the bolt plate—is integrated into the physical space, though its magical properties are less grounded.

  * grade_story_wc_340.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmosphere is well-rendered with sensory details like the "scent of engine oil and salt" and the "cold biting through thin slippers." The "shrine to flight" concept anchors the character of the captain effectively in the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_341.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "skeletal remains" of the docks and the gondola provide a solid atmospheric grounding. However, the setting is weakened by abstract metaphors like "clouds of unspoken apologies" that blur the physical reality of the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_342.txt (grade=7.1)
    The setting of a library inside a tree trunk beneath a condemned building is atmospheric and anchors the tone well. The sensory details ("damp paper," "creak of settling wood") effectively establish the "hush" required by the prompt, though the geography of the tree-within-a-building requires some suspension of disbelief.

  * grade_story_wc_343.txt (grade=5.6)
    The setting leans on steampunk staples (brass, ozone, creaking wood) without establishing a unique sensory signature. The hopscotch board is a specific, grounding detail that works well, but the surrounding atmosphere feels generic. The "antique airship" is sketched with familiar tropes rather than lived-in texture.

  * grade_story_wc_344.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting relies on standard fantasy tropes ("labyrinth," "mist," "prophecy") without generating unique, tactile constraints that pressure the protagonist's choices. The "driftwood" descriptor in the opening conflicts physically with the "frozen library above the clouds" logic, reading as a prompt insertion rather than an integrated atmospheric element.

  * grade_story_wc_345.txt (grade=6.0)
    The setting imagery is vivid ("bioluminescent fruit," "violet and gold") but decorative; the environment provides atmosphere but fails to constrain character choices or generate obstacles.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, effectively grounding the metaphysical stakes in concrete details (gears, salt, seaweed). The "pane of hush" is integrated well as a physical object, though the sensory description of its effects borders on the generic.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=7.9)
    Atmosphere is strong with "damp soil" and "brass wings" grounding the fantasy elements. The juxtaposition of the natural (gnarled roots) and mechanical (birds) creates a distinct setting, though the spatial layout of the labyrinth itself remains somewhat abstract.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=6.2)
    The ravine and sensory details ("damp moss," "scent of wet earth") are competent and ground the scene physically. However, the setting functions primarily as a static backdrop for internal monologue rather than an active force pressuring the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, offering vivid and specific imagery ("skylight that fractured sunlight," "glass orchard") that establishes a distinct atmosphere. The environment actively frames the narrative's surreal tone, though it acts more as a backdrop than a source of active constraint on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=6.1)
    The "coral icebound pavilion" provides a vivid, surreal visual anchor that grounds the scene effectively. However, the setting's potential constraints are ignored; the "icebound" nature and "tidal pools" are cosmetic backdrop rather than elements that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=4.1)
    The tower is described atmospherically but lacks tactile reality; the mechanics are treated as magical rather than mechanical. The specific time of day and physical environment do not constrain Mara's choices or the outcome.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.1)
    The canyon setting and the specific details of the mirror (spiderwebbed silver, leather strap) create a solid atmosphere. The environment interacts with the plot (moonlight as a catalyst), though the description of "humming walls" leans toward standard atmospheric tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is atmospheric but spatially inconsistent; stalactites pointing "downward" suggests normal gravity, contradicting the inversion premise that should redefine the traversal. Sensory details are frequently redundant (e.g., "luminous glow of bioluminescent"), cluttering the imagery rather than sharpening it.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=6.4)
    Atmosphere is the piece's strength, with tactile details like "calloused fingers" and the "hum" of the grove grounding the scene. The setting functionally provides the necessary tools (sculpture, insulator), though the "silence" functions more as a backdrop than an active pressure.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=6.3)
    The atmospheric details ("violet and rust," "hum of the stones") establish a coherent mood, but the setting operates mostly as a backdrop until the magical finale. The "magnetic nexus" is evocative but does not constrain Elias's tactical choices or force trade-offs until it simply activates.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmospheric details like the "smell of solder" and "lattice of stars" effectively ground the scene. The sensory contrast between the "hush" of the workshop and the impending "thunder" of the fireworks creates a tangible, functional setting that enhances the tension.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=6.2)
    The setting is vividly described with specific sensory details ("woven bridges creaking," "moss-lined balcony"), though the imagery occasionally leans into standard fantasy tropes. The environment provides a consistent backdrop but does not significantly constrain the protagonist's tactical choices beyond the initial setup.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=6.2)
    Visuals of the violet haze and silver trees are vivid and establish the atmosphere well. However, the logic of navigating by water flow during a gravity inversion undermines the physical reality of the threat, as liquid would likely be the most unstable element.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting creates a solid atmospheric pressure with sensory details like "scent of salt and rust" and "metallic groan." While effective, the description of the "living labyrinth" leans on standard tropes without a unique spatial or sensory signature.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=6.8)
    Sensory detail is vivid and effectively integrates the synesthetic attribute, grounding the magic in the setting. The environment constrains the action (aurora's availability), though descriptions occasionally lean toward ornamental adjectival stacking.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=6.8)
    Specific details in the canyon ("damp earth," "tremors") establish a solid atmosphere, but the "other side" relies on generic, abstract descriptors ("twisted light," "shifting shadows") that lack sensory bite. The setting fails to constrain the final choice beyond providing a generic location for the encounter.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is vivid and integral, with the "topaz glass" and "dying starlight" creating a specific, pressurized atmosphere that mirrors the protagonist's internal state. The sensory details ("ink that smelled of old parchment and copper," "fractured rainbows") are dense and evocative, successfully grounding the abstract mathematical concepts in physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and grounds the mystical elements, mirroring the protagonist's internal state well. However, specific descriptors like "towers of glass" and "rivers of silver" lean toward generic fantasy imagery rather than singular, lived-in detail.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=4.8)
    The juxtaposition of a high-fantasy "quartz arbor" with a modern "car window" creates jarring orientation issues without establishing the genre context (e.g., urban fantasy). The spatial relationship between the car (outside) and the mystic's ritual (inside) remains vague, harming immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=7.6)
    The orchard setting is established with strong atmospheric details, and the puzzle map is a vivid, specific grounding element. The transition to the city is less tactile, but the initial environment effectively sets the mythic tone.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=6.5)
    The setting of floating orchards and azure haze is visually vivid and establishes a distinct atmosphere. However, the environment serves primarily as a passive backdrop rather than an active force that constrains the character's choices or creates tactical difficulties.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=7.6)
    The "city of spires" and "mirrors" offer vivid, specific imagery that charges the climax, but the opening "ozone and rust" is a tired sci-fi placeholder that misses a chance for unique sensory grounding. The repair bay functions well as a constraint, but the initial atmosphere feels generic compared to the vision.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmospheric details like "soot-streaked glass" and "bruised twilight" effectively ground the scene. The setting actively pressures the protagonist, serving as both a container for grief and the medium of communication.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=7.2)
    Atmosphere is the story's strength, with vivid sensory details ("salt-laced dark," "ink-stained fingers"). However, the "city not yet built" remains visually generic compared to the specific grounding of the lighthouse.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is vivid and specific ("bamboo stilts submerged," "granite slab"), effectively grounding the ethereal tone. The environment supports the contemplative mood and provides distinct texture, though it functions more as a backdrop than a constraint on tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the damp sawdust, the clicking pin, and the storm-swept tower create a vivid, cohesive sensory experience. The setting of the labyrinth effectively grounds the abstract concepts, though the "moonlight pooling like mercury" is a slightly generic image.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting relies on standard fantasy atmosphere ("loomed," "endless night," "glow like captured starlight") rather than pressure-inducing specificity. While the "mica windows" provide a nice visual anchor, the environment functions largely as a static backdrop rather than a constraint that forces tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is atmospheric but leans on genre clichés ("parchment and beeswax," "dust motes"). The "paradox" section offers interesting potential (books that hum or age readers), but these elements function more as window dressing than constraints that force specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmospheric detail is strong, with sensory specifics like the "dense and dark" bread grounding the scene. The setting effectively mirrors the theme of decay and renewal, though the tea house itself leans on familiar genre tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "cathedral of ice" offers solid atmospheric visuals ("glinting," "breath curling"), establishing a distinct mood. However, the setting remains a backdrop; the cold and isolation do not aggressively constrain Elias's tactical choices or force specific physical compromises.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=6.6)
    Atmospheric details like "wavering fingers" of light and the smell of rust are vivid, establishing a strong mood. However, the "pirate market under a pier" setting leans on standard tropes without adding a distinct, specific layer to the environment.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=6.8)
    The "voting forests" concept provides vivid, specific imagery ("roots pulling free... like reluctant dancers") that anchors the fantasy effectively. While atmospheric, the setting largely serves as a backdrop rather than a constraint that forces tactical shifts.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=7.4)
    The "cathedral of amethyst" and "violet shadows" create a distinct, atmospheric setting that anchors the scene effectively. Sensory details like "charcoal-stained fingers" successfully link the character's trade to the physical environment.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=6.5)
    Atmospheric details like the "fogged" domes and "zinc-etched" plate anchor the setting well, though descriptions lean on standard dystopian tropes. The environment provides mood but does not exert active pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is atmospheric and active; the cold and wind are not just scenery but mechanisms that drive the plot (melting the ice, powering the sculpture). The "whispering ledge" and "spun silver" details create a cohesive mythic tone. The environment constrains the protagonist's choices effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.0)
    Atmosphere is vivid and cohesive, blending the mechanical and organic effectively. The "box of fears" serves as a potent micro-setting element that anchors abstract emotion in physical reality, enhancing the scene’s texture.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=5.6)
    Atmosphere is established with standard sensory details ("honey," "bronze"), but relies on clichés like "legendary" cinnamon rolls. The sudden mention of a "sandstorm calm" in the final line contradicts the clear, golden dawn weather established in the opening.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=7.5)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details ("corroded glass," "bioluminescent algae") establishing a palpable, sinking atmosphere. The environment effectively pressures the scene, though the urgency remains largely atmospheric until the end.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is excellent, with the "salt crystal growing chamber" and "pockets of gravity" actively pressuring the protagonist’s physical movement and choices. The sensory details ("tasted of ozone," "humming") create a vivid, immersive texture.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=4.0)
    The setting relies on generic fantasy signifiers ("quiet brook," "nocturnal haven") and abstract adjectives rather than concrete, constraining details. The "terrestrially cosmic" descriptor clashes with the tone, and the environment functions as a passive backdrop rather than an active force shaping the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=6.5)
    The atmosphere is established but leans on "magical" abstractions ("whisper of falling stars") rather than grounding, concrete details. The "language of stone" remains a vague concept, and the setting serves as a passive backdrop rather than an active constraint on the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atmosphere is cohesive and moody, effectively establishing the "twilight" tone. However, descriptors like "velvet garden" and "shimmer" feel slightly generic, and the setting functions more as a static backdrop than an active pressure on the character's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=6.1)
    The setting is established with vivid, albeit purple, imagery ("wept slow, rhythmic tears"). The sanctuary serves as a functional stage, though the convenient secret compartment in the altar feels more like a plot device than an integrated part of the world.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=5.1)
    Sensory details like "ozone" and "damp earth" work well, but "webs of intrigue" is abstract telling. The setting functions as a backdrop rather than a source of pressure or constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.2)
    The melted snow globe and the candle-lit ice shrine are evocative, specific anchors that effectively ground the supernatural elements. These physical details constrain the atmosphere and frame the inciting incident beautifully. The investigation settings (Reykjavik, Nuuk, Oslo) are mere labels, but the primary setting carries the weight well.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=6.8)
    The setting is vivid and establishes a cohesive mood, with the parapet and moon path effectively grounding the action. However, the description of the air as "scintillatingly somber" feels ornamental and semantically confused rather than precise.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=5.4)
    The setting is visually consistent but relies on standard post-apocalyptic tropes (sickly moonlight, glowing fruit) that serve as window dressing rather than constraining tactics. The environment does not force a specific trade-off or unique physical interaction beyond the initial walk.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=5.1)
    The setting is established with functional clarity but relies on generic fantasy descriptors ("spine of the world," "stormlit") that lack singular, gritty specificity. The environment serves as an atmospheric backdrop rather than a source of constraints or resources that pressure the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "feral loft" and salt-crusted textures establish a cohesive, melancholic atmosphere that suits the fable tone. However, descriptions occasionally lean into "purple" abstraction ("bruise of purple and gold") rather than grounding the scene in sharp, concrete constraints that force action.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the plot; the mechanics of ice and sound provide specific constraints on the action. The "golden sunset" opener is a bit generic, but the sonic texture of the marina is well-realized.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=7.4)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, creating a strong sense of place with details like "ozone and wet stone" and the "jagged crown" of spires. However, the environment serves primarily as a backdrop for reflection rather than a constraint that forces specific tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting is functional but relies on generic thriller tropes ("damp concrete," "flickering fluorescents"). The spatial geography is clear, but the environment serves as a passive backdrop rather than forcing specific tactical choices or constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=7.7)
    The repair shop is atmospheric, with sensory details like "lemon oil" and "dim light" effectively grounding the noir tone. The setting mirrors the mechanical nature of the mystery, though some descriptors drift into abstraction.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.3)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset; the "acid sea" and the groaning workshop create immediate, visceral pressure that constrains the protagonist's time. Sensory details like the "copper taste" of the lie and the "fused, pulpy mass" of the journal ground the surreal elements. The environment actively participates in the conflict.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=4.5)
    The setting consists of generic cyberpunk descriptors ("hummed with quiet static," "digital graveyard") without a distinct sensory signature. The interface—how Lena actually manipulates the data—is vague ("sifting," "scanning"), missing an opportunity to ground the "memory keeper" role in concrete tools or constraints.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=5.1)
    The "lighthouse orchard" offers a distinct initial image, but the "vintage store mirrors" feel artificially placed to meet criteria. Descriptions lean heavily on exhausted similes ("like skeletal fingers," "cutting through the dark like a blade").

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.7)
    The "skeletal" drift-ice marina is a vivid, pressure-filled environment that mirrors the internal thawing. The sensory details ("wet rattle," "scent of damp wool") are specific and ground the abstract themes in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "amber pavilion" and "golden canvas" provide a solid visual anchor. However, descriptors like "silence was a weight" and "mist curling" lean toward generic atmospheric tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=7.8)
    Atmospheric specificity is the story's highlight, with the "murmuring pavilion" and "skeletal hand" imagery grounding the mystical tone effectively. The environment successfully acts as a constraint, forcing the protagonist to rely on peripheral awareness, though the "kinetic parapet" remains largely ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=5.5)
    The setting is visually distinct and central to the concept, effectively contrasting the industrial ruins with the lavender. However, the description relies on stock phrases ("skeleton of its former self," "dew-kissed," "belching clouds") that dull the specificity. The environment provides atmosphere but does not constrain the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=7.9)
    Atmosphere is strong and sensory-rich, with the library's "aged paper and beeswax" and "groaning timbers" actively supporting the sound-based magic system. The setting integrates well with the plot, reacting to the protagonist's actions rather than serving as a static backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=6.5)
    Atmosphere is established, but the sensory writing often slips into abstraction ("thick as memory") rather than concrete grounding. The integration of the required "hush of old videotapes" phrase results in a strained synesthetic image that confuses the physical setting before the actual tapes appear.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=5.8)
    Atmospheric details like the "silver starlight" are vivid, but the setting's fundamental logic is confused—a "lunar" observatory implies a Moon location, yet it looks *at* the moon and floats above clouds, suggesting an Earth-based station. This spatial ambiguity undermines the physical stakes of the collapse, as the reader spends energy locating the scene rather than feeling the danger.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting ("radiant haven above the clouds") feels vague and stage-like, lacking grounding concrete details beyond the frosted glass. The "scent of hope" is treated as a literal sensory detail, which reads as an abstract imposition ("telling") rather than an immersive atmospheric element.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is competently described with standard fantasy markers (brass, ozone, gears), though it rarely constrains the protagonist's movement or choices. The "spoons twisting like serpents" imagery is vivid but clashes tonally with the solemn observatory, feeling like a remnant of a different story rather than an integrated world rule.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=7.2)
    Sensory details like the tooth "sharp with the memory of a child’s bite" and the "silver that pulsed like veins" create a strong, mythic atmosphere. The spatial logic is mostly clear, though the transition where the maze unfolds "before her" while she is already in the garden (behind the maze) creates a momentary hesitation in tracking the geography.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=6.2)
    The grotto is established with vivid, if slightly decorative, sensory details ("serpentine walls," "bioluminescent glow") that anchor the scene effectively. However, the setting serves primarily as a static backdrop; the environment does not actively constrain the protagonist's choices or force tactical improvisation.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.6)
    The setting is the story’s strongest element; the juxtaposition of the sterile data center with the encroaching moss garden effectively grounds the central metaphor. Sensory details like the "drip of thawing icicles" and "veins of a leaf" actively texture the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=6.5)
    The "feral nexus" is atmospheric, but relies on standard genre furniture (mist, rot, damp earth) rather than singular, concrete details. The sensory environment is functional but lacks the specificity required to ground the surreal elements.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=5.6)
    Sensory details like the "scent of crushed mint" are pleasant but the setting relies on standard fantasy imagery ("cathedral of leaves," "emerald arches"). The environment functions as a passive backdrop for the magic rather than a source of constraint or pressure on the protagonist's choices.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.7)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset; the subarctic crater and "living silence" actively constrain the ritual. The sensory details—frost-hardened soil, the specific detritus—anchor the magic in a tangible, textured reality.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is vivid and integral to the mechanism of the story; the quartz veins and lighting conditions are well-utilized. The atmosphere is distinct, though the sensory details occasionally lean into standard lyrical descriptions ("damp stone," "liquid gold").

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=7.8)
    The "bronze grotto" is a vivid, tactile setting that actively shapes the ritual. The specific detail of the "north wall where the bronze was thinnest" grounds the magic system in the physical environment effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, with "damp wool" and "warped floorboards" grounding the loft effectively. The sensory details successfully mirror Elara’s internal melancholy, though the rainy window is a familiar trope.

  * grade_story_wc_53.txt (grade=8.2)
    The "kinetic lagoon" and the rusted platform create a vivid, atmospheric setting that effectively mirrors the protagonist's internal stasis. Sensory details like the "warm" camera wheel and "static" sound anchor the surrealism, though the description occasionally leans on standard atmospheric tropes (mist, rust).

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=7.4)
    The juxtaposition of the abandoned spaceport with carnival remnants creates a distinct atmosphere, effectively grounding the theme. However, descriptions occasionally drift into purple prose ("neon residue... like a half-remembered promise") that distances the reader from the physical reality of the setting.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=7.5)
    Atmospheric specificity is the story's strength, effectively contrasting the "oil and old parchment" of the Spire with the "quartz" of the Forecourt. The setting actively isolates the protagonist, though the transition to the exterior feels slightly dream-logic driven rather than spatial.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=7.0)
    The setting is the story's strongest element, with specific sensory details ("damp wood," "smell of salt and something older") establishing a solid atmosphere. The twilight barge canal is vivid and grounds the more abstract thematic elements effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=7.4)
    Atmosphere is the story's strongest asset, with specific sensory details ("fibers stiff with salt," "fulgurite glass") grounding the abstraction. The "golden dock" and "oceanic hush" create a cohesive mood, though the imagery occasionally leans on adjective-heavy description over interaction. The setting successfully pressures the senses, if not the choices.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=7.6)
    The atmosphere is cohesive, and the specific prop (the golden thread) effectively anchors the abstract concept of connection. However, descriptions occasionally veer into "purple" territory ("breath curled... like a sigh"), reducing the sharpness of the imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the "suspended palace" and "chains thicker than ancient oaks" creating a strong sense of place. The specific clutter of the room (lute, contraption) effectively grounds the high-fantasy premise in tangible detail.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=4.2)
    Setting details are functional but verge on generic ("obsidian," "black sand") and serve primarily as metaphors for the theme. The presence of heavy firefighter boots during a moment of leisure strains plausibility and reads as an artificial role-marker.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=5.2)
    The "city of forgotten fountains" is established with decent atmospheric detail, but specificity collapses at the climax into the generic "room filled with light." The setting functions as a backdrop rather than a source of constraints or resources that shape the protagonist's tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=6.4)
    The nebula garden is visually distinct with "violet and gold petals," establishing a clear atmosphere. However, the setting behaves more like a passive backdrop for the theme than a physical environment that constrains Elias's choices. The sensory details are pleasant but standard ("soft thrum," "crystalline clarity").

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=5.2)
    While the setting is established with sensory density, the descriptions rely heavily on clichés ("mist clung... like a shroud," "sun bled into dusk," "cracked like spiderwebs") that render the atmosphere generic. The greenhouse is a static backdrop for the realization rather than a pressure cooker that forces the character to act. The "wet granite" and "old paper" offer some texture, but the overall effect is ornamental.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=7.6)
    The obsidian ridge and the clock tower create a distinct, atmospheric setting that grounds the fable-like tone. The sensory details of the slick climb and the "jagged teeth" effectively pressure the physical action, though some descriptions lean toward standard tropes.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=6.7)
    The setting of the cobalt silo is atmospheric and distinct, effectively grounding the tone of the piece. However, the secondary locations (riverbank, wall corner) feel generic and lack the specific, constraining detail found in the opening image.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=6.1)
    Imagery like "blade of black glass" and "liquid sky" establishes a vivid, if slightly stylized, high-fantasy atmosphere. The setting frames the scene effectively but acts more as a backdrop than a constraint that pressures the protagonist's actions.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=6.4)
    The "ember alcove" offers a cozy, coherent atmosphere with solid sensory anchoring ("damp ash"). However, the imagery relies heavily on safe, familiar tropes ("sleeping cat," "liquid gold") rather than specific, pressure-driven observation.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.1)
    The atmospheric details of the gallery and the sensory specificity of the ash and cold air are strong. The "vanishing point" concept successfully frames the physical space as an extension of the thematic conflict, though the setting functions more as a mood container than a source of obstacle.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=5.8)
    The atmospheric details of the sewer ("damp rot," "brackish water") are solid and ground the scene well. However, the setting fails to provide meaningful constraints beyond isolation, serving mostly as a static backdrop for internal monologue.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmospheric details ("aged paper and cinnamon," "gold and crimson leaves") are vivid and establish a cozy tone. However, the setting serves largely as backdrop rather than a constraining force that pressures the characters' choices.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=5.7)
    The setting is vivid but leans on standard ruin tropes ("iron ribs," "fractured light") without constraining the protagonist's choices. The greenhouse provides atmosphere but functions largely as a static backdrop until the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=6.4)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid, if slightly derivative, steampunk imagery ("copper veins," "floating gardens"). The sensory details are concrete, though the atmosphere leans heavily on adjectival stacking rather than organic integration into action.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=9.0)
    The animist setting is excellent; the "daydreaming" streetlights and "patient" water create a cohesive, breathing world that supports the central premise. The environment actively constraints the mood and reflects the protagonist's unique perception, fulfilling the 9+ requirement for setting as constraint/character.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=7.7)
    The underwater setting is vivid and constrains the action effectively (deliberate movements, rusted helmet). The imagery of the "foxglove-stained" ampoule and the "violet liquid" works well, though phrases like "captured twilight" veer into generic atmospheric description rather than specific, grounded sensory detail.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=5.6)
    The "scent of... regret" is a purple abstraction that damages sensory authority early on. However, the physical tilt of the stairs at the end provides a solid, constraining environmental change that grounds the closure.

  * grade_story_wc_74.txt (grade=7.8)
    The contrast between the "sour yellow" smog of the city and the fragile sanctuary of the greenhouse is vivid and effective. Sensory details like the scent of crushed mint and wet earth successfully anchor the atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with vivid sensory details like the "perpetual mist" and "wet moss" grounding the fantasy. The emerald-tinted lens effectively filters the protagonist's perception, adding a layer of specificity to how the world is viewed.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is starkly drawn and integral to the logic; the "black teeth" and "tide’s slow exhale" create a tangible, pressure-filled atmosphere that grounds the magical elements.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=5.8)
    The funhouse atmosphere is established with competent, if standard, gothic details ("rust and caramelized sugar"), though descriptions often lean into purple prose. The setting mirrors the internal conflict functionally, but the environment serves more as a backdrop for the dialogue than a physical space complicating the action. "Repulsive allure" is stated as a label rather than evoked through sensory contradiction.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is the story's strongest asset, with the "orchard on a driftwood raft" providing a vivid, surreal constraint that charges the imagery. Sensory details like "fruit that tasted of brine and stubbornness" and the "blue hour" create a cohesive, dreamlike atmosphere that grounds the magical realism. The environment actively participates in the climax, elevating the score.

  * grade_story_wc_79.txt (grade=8.6)
    The bio-organic setting is distinct and integral; the "fused turtle bone and coral" and "spiral-shell" details ground the fantasy effectively. The environment actively constrains the plot—Mira must climb the carapace and map physical fissures. The atmosphere is vivid, though the geography of the "salt flats" versus the "docks" relative to the moving turtles is left a bit vague.

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the damp stone, ivy, and rosebush grounding the scene effectively. The specific details like the loose floorboard and rusted turnstile integrate well with the action, charging the environment with a sense of decay that mirrors the theme.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=7.9)
    Atmosphere is the story’s strength, with the submerged pavilion providing a tactile, dynamic constraint. Sensory details like the tar-like ink and the water seeping into boots ground the abstract "memory" theme in physical reality.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=6.8)
    The atmosphere of the submerged library is evocative, using light and water effectively to mirror the internal discovery. While the physical logic of paper books surviving in a "saltwater" environment is questionable, the sensory details successfully ground the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=7.8)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, with the glass basilica and floating garden serving as strong objective correlatives for the protagonist’s fragility. Sensory details like "soot and solder" and "fractured rainbows" ground the fantastical elements effectively.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=6.2)
    The atmosphere is suitably grim, but the "floating" aspect of the observatory is underutilized, appearing only in the opening line without affecting spatial choreography. Descriptions lean toward cliché ("creaked like a dying beast," "fractured glass," "jagged shards") rather than specific, sensory observation.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=4.6)
    The setting is established with genre-standard descriptions ("ozone and old parchment," "brass teeth") that provide atmosphere but do not constrain the characters' actions or choices. The observatory functions as a passive stage for the drone operation rather than an environmental pressure cooker.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, with the "ghost fingers" driftwood serving as a strong, eerie detail that grounds the genealogy theme in the physical environment. The "cobalt terrace" and "bruised sky" establish a consistent mood. The environment meaningfully constrains the search method, anchoring the scene.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.1)
    The setting is vivid and atmospheric, acting as a "micro-setting" that constrains the meeting ("Too high for ambushes"). The sensory details ("slick with mist," "tarnished green") effectively ground the abstract negotiations in physical reality. The environment actively shapes the mood and pacing.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=5.8)
    Specific details like the utility poles ground the scene, but the atmosphere is marred by clashing descriptors ("lapping merrily melancholic"). Physical grounding is functional, though some imagery leans on clichés ("rocks... like broken teeth").

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=6.3)
    The setting is atmospherically competent ("pulsed," "lapping") but leans heavily on standard bioluminescent cave tropes. The environment serves as a passive container for the plot rather than offering constraints that force unique tactical decisions.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.8)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific, effectively blending sensory details (cinnamon, clove, burning cedar) with the magical premise. The "permanent moonlight" and "glowing fruit" establish the tone immediately. The orchard feels like an active participant ("sighed in approval"), which elevates the setting beyond a mere backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=7.7)
    The setting is atmospheric and specific ("grass silvered by starlight," "slow breath of cumulus"), effectively grounding the ethereal premise. The "glade above the clouds" feels tangible, though the sensory details occasionally crowd the narrative momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.2)
    The setting is the story’s strongest element, effectively blending mechanical decay with metaphysical weight through details like "walls papered with faded photographs" and "corridors lined with ghosts." The environment actively participates in the narrative, grounding the abstract concept of healing in the tactile action of stitching the ship's skin. The atmosphere remains consistent and supports the tone of a "floating reliquary."

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=5.2)
    The setting is established but leans on standard descriptors ("crunching black sand," "billowing dress"). While the volcano provides a backdrop, it functions more as a stage set than a source of immediate physical pressure until the very end. The atmosphere is coherent but lacks the sensory specificity that creates immersion.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=6.3)
    The "luminous fort" with "bioluminescent moss" creates a distinct visual atmosphere that supports the "twilight" constraint. While atmospheric, the setting details (like the moss-light) are mostly ornamental and do not significantly constrain the protagonist's tactical choices.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=7.2)
    The sensory detail of "friction vanishing" is an excellent, tangible anchor that defines the atmosphere and stakes effectively. The bluff and aurora are vivid, though the sudden utility of the painted rocks feels slightly convenient within the physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=7.5)
    The observatory setting is vivid and atmospherically integrated, using the storm to mirror the internal state effectively. While immersive, descriptions occasionally veer into melodrama ("forgotten god’s watchtower") that distances the reader.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=6.1)
    The atrium setting is established with clear sensory details ("hummed," "glass walls"), though the spatial logic of the light map on the floor is difficult to visualize. The environment participates in the puzzle but feels slightly stage-bound.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=5.7)
    The setting is functional but relies on dystopian clichés like "skeletal ribs" and "rusted library" without offering specific, singular details that would ground the scene in a unique reality. While the physical space of the library is clear, the atmosphere leans into generalized sentimentality ("shelves stocked with dreams") rather than sensory immediacy.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.8)
    The tidal arbor is immersive and functional, acting as both a constraint and the instrument of the climax. Specific details like the "salt-tinged mist" and "bioluminescent moss" ground the surrealism, though the score is capped by the Q2 gate (must be ≥9.0 to unlock 9+ here).

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.3)
    Sensory details like the "bioluminescent blossoms" and the seed’s "spiraling glyphs" establish a vivid, atmospheric setting that feels distinct and lived-in. The ridge functions well as both a physical location and a thematic anchor ("living archive"). While "glowing plants" are a genre trope, the specific mechanic of the book-plant adds a fresh, tactile layer to the world-building.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.1)
    The atmospheric details (salt, mist, damp earth) effectively establish a moody, coherent setting. While some descriptions lean toward standard literary pathetic fallacy ("islet breathed"), the specific interaction with the bonsai and the antique lace grounds the scene well in the immediate physical space.

  * grade_story_wc_152.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cobalt dome, parchment air, and eternal candle create a tactile micro-setting that constrains Liora’s reach—she can only leave by disguising herself among the very maps she’s made. Autumn’s golden leaves return in the final image, re-pricing the season as aftermath rather than ornament. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the single location and her brief street foray. While the city beyond is sketched in silhouette, the observatory’s sensory grip is sufficient for this length.

  * grade_story_wc_153.txt (grade=8.5)
    Mangrove roots, brackish water, and boardwet condensation act as proximate cage; every tactile detail is filtered through Liora’s regret-narrowed attention. Shard serves micro-setting, constraining when she presses it to flesh and later glows in reflection. Spatial choreography clean: crouch, wipe, stand, tuck—bodies track without drift. Atmosphere mirrors internal humidity without overt symbolism, charging final “cool moisture” touch.

  * grade_story_wc_154.txt (grade=8.5)
    The mist-clad atrium is not postcard scenery; its cold marble and ghostly arches physically force Lena to crouch, press plaster, and bridge vertical distance to the boy. The cast itself becomes micro-setting—its ridges, graphite, and coordinates constrain her fingers and decode the next move. Sensory hierarchy obeys anesthetic haze: edges blur, temperature dominates, coral heat registers against thigh. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from balustrade to courtyard to final touch.

  * grade_story_wc_155.txt (grade=8.9)
    Fog, skeletal trees, and the plaster shard function as micro-setting: the shifting mist literally governs when Liora can expose film, and the crumbling wall supplies both the fragment and the final display surface. Sensory selection is POV-driven—she notices light angles, not tourist landmarks—and the orchard’s decay mirrors the fading fresco without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: tripod placement, boot suction in mud, print pinning all track. Environment constrains the climax by providing the only viable “gallery” left, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_156.txt (grade=8.7)
    Sound-wave garden, scaffold glass, and nickel form a micro-setting triad that constrains every move: parabolic tilt limits retreat, cracked glass forecloses safety, nickel becomes key. Selective sensory hierarchy—fogged breath, spinning rims—keeps texture urgent and POV-filtered. The garden’s physics is lightly hand-waved (dishes pivot without motive), but the image charges the final threshold enough to touch 8+.

  * grade_story_wc_157.txt (grade=8.0)
    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: humidity fogs lenses, vines curl into runes, bees act as pollinating code—each detail later weaponized in the warp scheme. Sensory triangulation (hum, scent, glass) stays filtered through Elias’s entomologist bias. Inspector’s boots on tile provide one sharp auditory anchor that shifts power instantly.

  * grade_story_wc_158.txt (grade=8.9)
    The shell’s porous walls act as both camera and resonator, constraining him to see only his own reflection until he writes; the postcard’s holographic surface evolves from burned to soft, charging the final image. Sensory selection skews to salt, spiral light, and off-key wind—every detail feeds the poem’s emergence. Spatial choreography is tight: desk, postcard, pen, and shell-orifices track cleanly across the beat.

  * grade_story_wc_159.txt (grade=9.1)
    Every sensory detail is filtered through Liora’s curator gaze: parchment-metallic air, prismatic petal-whispers, the bamboo shadow “almost like a mouth.” The library’s impossible altitude and extinct-feeling museum are not backdrop; they supply the only tools she can use—glass blooms, ledger of fading names—and thus constrain every tactic. The final image of light slanting through the cracked tube literally recharges the orchid, so environment charges closure. Micro-setting (her palm against a petal, the tube’s jagged rim) substitutes for geography without ever floating free of POV.

  * grade_story_wc_16.txt (grade=8.4)
    Archive is rendered through sensory compression—dead-tongue weight, rippling glass, sliding books—creating an accumulative tomb-texture. The ink-well micro-setting constrains the final act: its shattering reweights the room’s silence, satisfying the 9-band gate, but broader spatial anchors (where within archive, time of night) arrive late, capping at 8.4.

  * grade_story_wc_160.txt (grade=8.3)
    Amphitheater-as-body and surveyor’s chain-as-river compress setting into micro-objects that constrain choice. Volcano breath and shifting stone charge the final image of “dancing” with the past. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s engineer gaze—brass gears, cracked wax, metal temperature—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography clean; no weather clichés.

  * grade_story_wc_161.txt (grade=8.7)
    The attic’s warped boards, dust galaxy, and false-panel cache are not backdrop but tools that constrain access and discovery. Skylight geometry literally shapes Elias’s mapping method; the velvet box gives the meteorite weight in hand at the exact beat choice crystallizes. Sensory hierarchy—paper rot, rust-red chip, boot-kicked dust—mirrors internal decay and possible renewal without overt symbolism. Spatial choreography is flawless across two bodies and hidden compartments.

  * grade_story_wc_162.txt (grade=8.1)
    The drifting prism terrace is not backdrop; its tilting panels and jagged rainbows physically destabilize Elias’s footing and mirror the splintering of certainty. The glass prism he handles in the final beat reweights the earlier refraction motif, making the setting charge the closure image. Micro-setting (the spiral-grained bench) constrains his tactile search and is tracked consistently. Meets 9+ gate: environment charges final image with cost.

  * grade_story_wc_163.txt (grade=8.4)
    Bioluminescent algae, damp walls, rebreather straps, and the feather’s singed edge are concrete and filtered through Elias’s tactile attention. The facility and ruins are sketched with economical sensory triangulation; spatial logic tracks from atrium to spiral stairs to dome to chamber. The underwater city never becomes a white room; the environment’s pulsing light directly enables the climax. Micro-setting (the feather’s depression) literally unlocks the ending, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_164.txt (grade=8.1)
    Crystal geode functions as micro-setting: reflective surfaces externalize Liora’s shifting emotions and permit the transliteration beat. Light refraction, algae glow, crater glass weight—all tactile, POV-filtered, and mirrored in her final stance. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room. Object-as-setting (glass) charges closure image. Meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_165.txt (grade=8.0)
    The tidal arcade’s salt-bleached ribs, starlit water, and cracked lantern are filtered through Lira’s performer eye; every prop is handled, swung, reflected. Environment constrains footing, sound carry, and visibility, directly shaping the improvised dance and the violinist’s approach. Micro-setting (bishop, lantern) doubles as emotional gauge without overt symbolism. Sensory economy is high; no atmospheric detail sits idle.

  * grade_story_wc_166.txt (grade=8.2)
    The twilight garden’s salt wind, moss-slick stones, and star-gaps are filtered through Liora’s dancer body, constraining her barefoot balance and guiding her finger-dance of ink. Spatial choreography is exact: stones, undergrowth, wrist proximity track cleanly. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and kinesthetic over visual, apt for a tide dancer. Environment mirrors internal shift: dusk edge mirrors her move from isolation to alliance.

  * grade_story_wc_167.txt (grade=8.4)
    Harbor dawn is anchored fast (cold breath, salt ledger scent, groaning walkway); glass, water, and mist recur as tactile filters that guide attention toward the prism atrium. The prism’s fractured panes and the stone’s ripple pool are micro-settings that literally refract meaning, charging the final image; occupational detail (lantern-pane as “tiny prison for light”) fuses setting with theme, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_168.txt (grade=8.1)
    Moonlit ridge, pine scent, and porcelain fractures are filtered through Elias’s fire-trained eye; the cracked box becomes the micro-setting that charges the final image. Spatial choreography is clean—crouch, cradle, sit, pass pen—no floating bodies. Weather (distant thunder) tightens the hush without forcing symbolism. Environment does not actively constrain tactics, so capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_169.txt (grade=8.5)
    Grotto’s tide-polished quartz and dangling shell constellations are tactile, selective, and mirror the Fibonacci obsession; environment literally guides her pattern-building choices. Micro-setting triumph: the altitude gauge’s brass becomes a second heartbeat, constraining her final stance. Spatial choreography is immaculate—no floating props. Light fractals charge the closing image, satisfying the 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_17.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ivy, warm stone, ozone, and scorched-leaf black edges create tactile specificity that guides bodily movement (ducking, kneeling, hovering hand). The corridor’s feverish wall constrains pace and signals unseen agency, charging the final symbol-map. Spatial choreography is tracked; no white-room syndrome. Environment passes the 9+ gate by shaping the final hesitation beat.

  * grade_story_wc_170.txt (grade=8.7)
    The terrace, prism parapet, and pre-bell hush are returned to in every beat; rain-caught facets literally color the paint and constrain what she can steal for the canvas. Micro-setting (the wet stone under her knees, the dying light on glass) channels her tactical choices and charges the final image. Jasmine scent and echoing bells function as sensory metronomes, not ornament. Spatial choreography stays crisp across two bodies and one shifting mirage.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.1)
    Jasmine scent, cicada hum, and scuffed ancient stone are filtered through Liora’s fatigued attention, never touristic. The terrace’s history of mingled blood and wine directly pressures the choice to proceed; the setting is not backdrop but moral crucible. Micro-setting succeeds: the clipboard’s singed edge and warm silver coin are tactile extensions of body and decision. Spatial choreography is clean—edge, shadows, altar—though moonlight on armor is familiar imagery.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=8.4)
    Setting is filtered through Elias’s guilty connoisseur gaze—boots sinking into crystalline crust, egg shell catching “sickly” moonlight—details that later dissolve. The salt flat and cracked riverbed map constrain every move; the egg acts as portable micro-setting that charges the final image. Weather’s withheld thunder tightens the waiting stance. One minor spatial float: “distant, rumbling lull” is repeated without shift in perceived distance.</question>
    <question>4</question><grade>8.3</grade><comment>Dominant stake—can a man possess absence itself?—tightens once: the drought he paid for must now be relinquished to keep the echo alive. Agency is renunciation; cost is the looming erasure of his monumental emptiness. Pressure grows situationally under the salt-flat crucible; coincidence merely hovers (the thunder never breaks). A crisper physical loss (boots ruined? phone traceable?) would have nudged higher.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.6)
    Silver courtyard, prism walls, and snow function as micro-setting: the mirrored surface literalizes the stakes of self-seeing and charges the final image. Sensory selection favors reflective cold—glinting glass, starlight fracture—mirroring internal rigidity that melts only after the black thread is pulled. Spatial choreography is clean; barefoot prints track cause and effect. No occupational detail required; weather and crystal constrain choice on every beat.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=8.4)
    The rusted dome is no postcard: its swallowing acoustics force Liora to whisper, the curved wall becomes her puppet screen, and the meteor hush tightens every syllable. Salt wind, lamp-oil air, and shifting shadows are filtered through her calligrapher’s eye for negative space. The campfire stick’s carved bird is micro-setting that literally moves in the candlelight, charging the final image. Environment, tool, and body converge to constrain how the story can be voiced.

  * grade_story_wc_175.txt (grade=8.8)
    The grotto’s mist, moss, and altitude are filtered through Liora’s esoteric gaze; every sensory note (moth-wing iridescence, reed lattice sag) is purposive. The stacked-stone tower and loose-twine knot function as micro-setting objects that constrain her ritual choices and charge the final image when the wind is expected to undo them. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms. Weather is not just mood but timer—monarchs leave at dusk—so environment shapes tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_176.txt (grade=8.9)
    Icebound sanctum, aurora pulses, frost-stiff rope, and breath-warmed fibers are filtered through caster’s tactile priorities; every sensory note constrains the braiding action. Micro-setting (rope as tool) charges the final vibration. One sentence of mild register drift (“conceptual repricing”) is outside POV lexicon but does not touch closure. Meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_177.txt (grade=7.9)
    Vine-draped bunker, rewilded forest, and storm form a living pressure system: roots “reclaim concrete,” rain is “heavy and deliberate,” the oak door shimmers under palm. These details are filtered through Elias’s edge-seeking bias and constrain movement—vines “guide,” storm enforces forward motion. The wafer seal serves as micro-setting that evolves from broken insignia to malleable key, directly enabling closure. No spatial drift; all anchors (who/where/when) hold. Environment charges the final image without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_178.txt (grade=8.8)
    The palace’s cracked lapis, cedar oil, and descending star-through-roof constrain movement and symbolism; the body-under-pressure is the setting. Every sensory note is filtered through Nabu-sharru’s astronomer gaze—myrrh reads as “faint scent,” not catalog. The star-mirror final image recharges earlier “constellations caught in a god’s breath,” earning the high band.

  * grade_story_wc_179.txt (grade=8.0)
    Soundless Sanctuary is evoked through tilted floor, breath-like walls, and silence that “gnaws,” all filtering through Elara’s body. The pin serves as micro-setting: its broken/whole states track the emotional pivot and physically constrain the final exchange. Sensory range is narrow—mostly tactile and auditory absence—but that narrowness mirrors her hyper-focus and keeps description purposeful. Environment never blocks action or supplies resource limits, so it supports atmosphere more than tactical choice, capping entry to the 8-band.

  * grade_story_wc_18.txt (grade=8.6)
    Fog, frost, and glass mountain are tactile and selective; each constrains movement and charges the final image when the mountain dissolves into mist. Micro-setting (the sextant in pocket) becomes the charged object that certifies the boundary’s erasure.

  * grade_story_wc_180.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cathedral-orchard is not backdrop; its low branch supplies the girl’s perch and the peach that finalizes the reconfiguration. Micro-setting (quartz pendant, resin, silver wire) constrains the literal repair and metaphoric transfer. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—dappled light, damp earth under boots—never touristic. One hairline slip: “skeletal rafters” appears twice in close proximity.

  * grade_story_wc_181.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orchard and gallery are sketched with starlight and humming blossoms; the bathroom’s underground spring anchors the breakthrough beat. Spatial choreography is clean; the shell’s glass case and the window-tracked shift outside constrain her reach and sight, charging the final moment.

  * grade_story_wc_182.txt (grade=8.7)
    Mountain-bookstore is tactile: spines like trees, air “humming with panic,” shelves that rearrange when unobserved. The diary functions as micro-setting, its pressed petals guiding moves. These environmental rules constrain tactics—Elara uses plant lore to decode shelf shifts—charging the final door image. A hairline slip: we never feel temperature or bodily fatigue despite descent “deeper than roots,” keeping it just shy of top band.

  * grade_story_wc_183.txt (grade=8.3)
    Ship-as-setting is textural engine: rusted hull groans, funhouse mirrors warp distance, garden of names replaces soil with memory-vines—each layer constrains movement and charges the final image. Fog acts as both ceiling and solvent, forcing inward navigation. Micro-setting (emerald card’s unnatural coolness) doubles as tactile compass. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating rooms. Environment directly shapes the only possible exit—dissolution into fog—meeting the 9+ gate for setting-driven constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_184.txt (grade=8.0)
    Selective sensory triage—oil, parchment, warm wax—roots us inside the mechanism room and later inside the vanished hall. The ceremonial rope functions as micro-setting: its tension and shifting glow physically constrain Liora’s fingers and decide when the vision releases her. Spatial choreography stays coherent; the door’s vanishing is anchored to the final chime. No environment detail is wasted; each smell or gleam feeds the next causal beat.

  * grade_story_wc_185.txt (grade=8.0)
    Harmonic caves, ripple-ice, and lantern shadows are filtered through Ryn’s mapkeeper gaze; sensory pick-list tracks her goal. The bloom sphere as micro-setting directly shapes the final choice—she must touch and bind it—so environment constrains tactics. Gently luminous ice recurs without stalling momentum. Spatial choreography stays coherent through the frost-curtain passage.

  * grade_story_wc_186.txt (grade=8.1)
    The glass pavilion’s wind-song and salt-crusted panes are filtered through Elias’s custodial reflexes—lighting lanterns “to remind the stars” anchors place, body, and purpose in one motion. The broken prism’s tactile danger (sharp enough to draw blood) and light-splitting effect constrain the climactic gesture on the platform, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is spare but coherent: table → coat → platform → horizon. Weather and alkali scent serve as immediate pressure, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_187.txt (grade=8.6)
    Crystal forecourt, brass domes, and solidified fog are vivid, selective, and mirrored in Elara’s slippery footing. The “stormlit” palette and rain-refracted light return in the final image, charging the bridge decision. Micro-setting (boots clicking on glass) constrains each step, integrating description into action. A hairline slip toward atmospheric catalog in the third paragraph keeps it from the 9-band.

  * grade_story_wc_188.txt (grade=8.7)
    The fortress’s petal-shadows and the alcove torches constrain her path and supply the exact tool she must sacrifice, satisfying the 9+ gate. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: fireworks designer notices wick brittleness, smoke weight, flame greed. Selective detail—no stars, damp earth, warm dais—mirrors her narrowing focus. Spatial choreography is clean from outer wall to dais; no floating bodies or lost anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_189.txt (grade=8.7)
    Setting is filtered through Liora’s chronicler gaze—salt lacework, star ripples, cicada weight—each detail pressures her final choice. The grotto’s transitional liminality (tide-breath-conversation) constrains her options: stay hidden or re-enter the pause above. Spatial choreography is clean; body, pool, carved insect track precisely. Micro-setting (the pool as veil) literally enables the vanishing that ends the story.

  * grade_story_wc_19.txt (grade=8.8)
    The spongy vine under bare feet, syrupy air, and cloud-ceiling glow are filtered through Liora’s sensory hierarchy—every detail tightens or eases her claustrophobia. The doll’s chipped smile and the trellis’s creak act as micro-setting that directly constrain her next step. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track distance, sway, and shifting gravity without drift. Environment charges the final image—she pockets the doll and feels the sky’s hush become a second skin she must eventually shed.

  * grade_story_wc_190.txt (grade=8.2)
    Prism terrace, floating lanterns, and the storm-glass micro-setting are sensuously filtered through Elias’s professional eye; the glass’s shifting liquid physically mirrors the passenger’s tension and charges the final still image. Spatial choreography is clear across the single gondola space; environment guides the choice to drift and listen.

  * grade_story_wc_191.txt (grade=8.4)
    Neon Grove is rendered through motion—water parting, flake drifting, bark peeling—so description never stalls plot. The living-wood throne and pulsing fruit are tactile, not tourist postcard. Micro-setting (ruby flake in palm) literally unlocks the staircase, satisfying the 9+ gate. One minor slip: “city of glass and steel” flash is unmoored from POV’s knowledge horizon.

  * grade_story_wc_192.txt (grade=8.1)
    Sanctuary’s cracked roof and cold iron ring are returned as tactile constraints—starlight dust on the child’s skin, ring pulsing with her breath—turning setting into a ventilator that literally enables the final shared inhale; micro-setting beats fulfill the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_193.txt (grade=8.3)
    The bioluminescent farm is sketched with sensory economy—“damp earth,” “ozone,” “spirals”—and the tunnel’s porthole is precisely anchored in space. The bolt’s temperature shifts act as micro-setting, constraining the final hand-to-diamond choice. No orientation debt; who/where/when are clear by line 40. While broader ag-tech or mycelium logic is absent, the selective detail feeds the fungal uncanny without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_194.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sepia archive is sketched with selective sensory economy—golden shadows, warped plank, fluttering pages—each detail either enables or responds to the crank activation. Micro-setting (bridge plank) literally bears Elias’s weight and channels the waves, so environment constrains the final tactic. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography holds as he crosses to the shelves.

  * grade_story_wc_195.txt (grade=8.7)
    The greenhouse’s fogged glass, pulsing fruit, and twisting branches are filtered through Aldric’s war-numbed perception; the setting actively constrains the final choice by literally winding strings around his limbs, turning environment into antagonist. One hairline slip: the sky “that had forgotten dawn” is vivid but never re-enters the perceptual field to charge the ending.

  * grade_story_wc_196.txt (grade=7.8)
    File-room dust, glue scent, and button tactility anchor POV attention and constrain action (Elias reads grief through smudges). The boarding-house shard reuses sensory selectivity (“sharp eyes and a soft voice”). Environment never forces a tactical change, so capped at 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_197.txt (grade=8.0)
    Auric lagoon, reeds, rusted hatch, and server chamber are sketched with selective sensory detail; starlight on water and damp metal anchor mood without catalog bloat. The “puddle-map” micro-setting directly guides Lira’s path, satisfying the 9+ constraint. Spatial choreography is coherent—no impossible moves. Economy is good; only the lagoon’s “liquid fire” flirts with cliché, but the image is immediately functional.

  * grade_story_wc_198.txt (grade=8.7)
    Prism atrium, saxophone, and grotto are tactile, bioluminescent, and return in the final image; the sax’s changing weight even guides the last beat. Selective sensory triage (mist, reed, dew) keeps the 800-word economy tight. Setting never blocks action, though spatial footprint of grotto remains lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_199.txt (grade=8.6)
    The arbor’s ashen branches and whispering leaves are tactile filters for Liora’s attention; the moss stain on her hands at the end literalizes setting absorbed into body. Micro-setting—the moonstone speck on a single leaf—becomes the pivot object that charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean: kneeling, plucking, stacking stones track without drift. Weather and light evolve causally with the beat sequence, tightening atmosphere rather than decorating it.

  * grade_story_wc_2.txt (grade=8.1)
    Oil-and-rust workshop, cracked greenhouse, roaring subterranean fall—each node is economically sketched through Elias’s tool-handling. The compass glow and mist-on-skin supply tactile hooks that feed the final image of clockwork automatons freezing as time hiccups. No single environment constrains a tactical choice, so the 9-gate stays closed, but specificity is consistent and atmosphere supports the textural drive.

  * grade_story_wc_20.txt (grade=8.9)
    The rain-slick foundry is not backdrop; the damp ash sucks at boots, the sagging beam forces the crouch that reveals the coin, the dying embers’ glow provides the only light that lets the scratches be seen. Micro-setting supremacy: the anvil’s cold underside against her palm is the tactile pivot that converts data (name carved) into emotional cost. Every sensory pick is filtered through alchemical priorities—iron scent = failed experiment, not generic industry. Spatial choreography survives the tunnel approach; no impossible positions.

  * grade_story_wc_200.txt (grade=8.2)
    Echo Gorge breathes, drips, and sings; the misaligned harp is both soundscape and tool, its warped lullaby plucked by unseen hands that finally hand over the note. Wet stone, dry reeds, and the croc-tooth’s thigh-press tether every beat to a body that must decide.

  * grade_story_wc_201.txt (grade=8.3)
    UV resin, ozone-metallic air, and pewter strap give tactile anchors that double as trauma triggers; the forest’s light pulses in sync with Elias’s heartbeat, integrating setting into body. Spatial choreography stays clean: strap found beneath chair → coiled in palm → edge glows after vial, tracking state change. The “ultraviolet penance” concept is learned through ingestion rather than exposition, satisfying world-rule consistency. Environment directly constrains the final image—he braces against the tree not for balance but to measure the new weight of mercy.

  * grade_story_wc_202.txt (grade=8.9)
    The swaying rope bridges, salt-and-sugar scent, and submerged-lighthouse painting are selective, sensory, and filtered through Liora’s translator-bias. The fragment itself functions as micro-setting: its pulse against notebook leather and locket constrains her next moves and charges the final image. Spatial choreography stays coherent across stalls, attic, empty booth. One minor missed opportunity: the city beyond the rafters remains a glow rather than a pressure, but this does not cap the score.

  * grade_story_wc_203.txt (grade=8.5)
    Ticket-office detritus—peeling marquee, dust strata, child-sized print—grounds every beat; the mainspring itself becomes micro-setting that charges the final image, meeting the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography stays clean in a single shard, though exterior circus district is only gestured at.

  * grade_story_wc_204.txt (grade=8.7)
    The glass orchard library is not mere postcard scenery; its humming spines and chiming branches supply immediate sensory stakes and later fracture to mirror Elias’s internal crack. The frost-map constrains his next move—he deciphers it on his knees and the melting ice literally reveals the abyss beneath, forcing the final decision. Environment and recurring object (bottle/tree) charge the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_205.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shard functions as micro-setting that constrains every tactical choice; its light angles dictate mirror placement and final ritual success. Baroque asteroid is sketched via selective barbs—“ribs of some great beast”—rather than catalog. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s poet-eye: light fracture over acoustics. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_206.txt (grade=7.8)
    Brass scars, oil scent, and the chip’s crimson hum are tactile and selective, anchoring POV bias. The resonance chamber acts as micro-setting: its thrum vibrates Elias’s teeth, guiding his decision to kneel and later insert the chip. Spatial choreography is coherent—workbench, doorway, light shift. While the “cloak woven from patches of twilight” edges toward purple, it is brief and serves the fairy-tale register. Environment does not constrain tactics as sharply as the chip itself, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_207.txt (grade=8.7)
    Limestone cliff, fissure, black lagoon, and bioluminescent algae are filtered through Elias’s loom-and-scent vocabulary; every sensory pick pressures his choice to dip or retreat. The warm water against skin is the micro-setting that finally constrains the seal decision. Spatial choreography tracks cleanly from cliff to ledge. One tiny repeat—“surface” twice in two lines—keeps it from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_208.txt (grade=8.4)
    Storm-slick stones, ozone-and-paper air, and driftwood edges “worn smooth by centuries” are selective, POV-filtered details that guide Elias’s haptic attention toward carving. The archway’s turbine hum and the cavern’s pulsing walls function as micro-setting that directly supplies the material and motive for the final bridge. Spatial choreography holds: slide shatters at threshold, pieces rearrange underfoot, bridge is placed center. Environment constrains the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_209.txt (grade=8.0)
    Sensory triad—honeyed beams, thawing cobblestones, candle-flicker on stone—filters through Liora’s attention economy. The cathedral glass functions as micro-setting that literally refracts her insight; the postcard stack acts as portable setting-object carried across scenes. Selective detail keeps momentum; no white-room drift. Environment does not constrain bodily choice but charges the final image enough to meet 8+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_21.txt (grade=8.2)
    Selective sensory triage works: brass shelves groan, salt-and-gun-oil scent, black water “cold as a corpse’s touch.” The obsidian lagoon re-appears at closure as the agent that reclaims killers, turning setting into antagonist. Micro-setting (rusted key in rock crevice) directly enables the final ledger retrieval. Proper-noun economy is tight; no anchor drift.

  * grade_story_wc_210.txt (grade=8.1)
    Salt-cove is sketched with lantern-light, rotting wood, and amber refraction that doubles as emotional lens; the bottle itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains every tactic. Spatial choreography is tight—bottle, table, cove line-of-sight track cleanly. Environment directly charges the final image: lanterns “burn steady” as the new reality ignites.

  * grade_story_wc_211.txt (grade=8.6)
    Skyscraper-orchard is impossible yet instantly legible; roots-through-steel and hidden aquifers give it tactile physics. The phonograph horn angled “toward the sky” and the pomegranate that actually drips onto the wax are micro-setting objects that constrain the final recording and charge the closure image. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and low-frequency sound, matching the stake of listening rather than seeing.

  * grade_story_wc_212.txt (grade=8.1)
    Icebound atrium functions as micro-setting: its frost melts under vortex pressure, physically constraining and enabling the past-reveal. Starlight, scent of loam, and damp down are filtered through Liora’s seed-saver attention; spatial track (kneel-press-rise) stays coherent. Environment directly shapes the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_213.txt (grade=8.4)
    The frayed, copper-wired rope functions as micro-setting: its texture guides her kneeling, its fraying mirrors institutional decay, and its final vibration charges the closing image. Ozone-scented thin air and cloud-serpents are selective, not tourist catalog. Weather shifts causally affect her choice (“the storm had changed its mind”). Spatial choreography is clean: rope pools, she kneels, stands, re-kneels; bell hangs above.

  * grade_story_wc_214.txt (grade=8.9)
    Ozone-and-parchment air, patched dome, cold tracking array—selective sensory triad anchors world without catalog. The station’s decrepitude constrains Elias’s ritual movements and is re-charged when the alarm sputters, turning setting into participant. Spatial choreography stays clean as he moves from console to window. Micro-setting (lantern glass) ultimately carries the closure glow, meeting the 9+ constraint test but with minor over-reliance on visual.

  * grade_story_wc_215.txt (grade=8.0)
    Cracked earth, skeletal trees, rusted frames, and the stained-glass box create a tactile micro-setting that directly constrains the final act. Sensory triage favors sight and sound (ghost-wing hum), matching Elias’s perceptual bias. Spatial choreography is clean: ghost woman crosses from apiary to table in one deliberate vector. Environment mirrors interior desiccation without overt symbolism, charging the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_216.txt (grade=8.3)
    The emerald silo’s jade decay, the cracked-ice glaze, the scent of approaching rain—each detail is filtered through Elias’s haptic obsession with time’s texture and returns in the final image of the restored field. The silo doubles as micro-setting and temporal lung; its dust and echo constrain every action, while the urn fragment literally alters atmospheric density, satisfying the 9+ constraint gate.

  * grade_story_wc_217.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cobalt lagoon’s post-rain surface, the drake feather’s oil-sheen, and the woven dawns in reeds are selective, sensory, and POV-filtered; the feather-as-quill finally constrains the closing act of writing, charging the image. Micro-setting (body, tool) successfully substitutes for broader geography.

  * grade_story_wc_218.txt (grade=8.6)
    Setting is filtered through Elias’s caretaker gaze: stone “grown, not carved,” copper soon “invisible inside bark.” Micro-setting (wire, berries, fox muzzle) constrains action and charges the final beat. Sensory hierarchy favors touch and muted sound, matching mortal fatigue. Spatial choreography is flawless—body, wire, branch, altar track cleanly.

  * grade_story_wc_219.txt (grade=8.1)
    Rain-slick steps, hawthorn air, and ivy-swallowed statues are filtered through Elias’s wary gaze; every sensory note is also a judgment on entropy. The tower’s hollow core and open roof function as micro-setting that literally channels the dawn light onto the reaction, so environment constrains the final image. Spatial choreography is flawless: we track his boots, satchel, fingers, and the mortar in a clean circle. Missing the 9 because the sculpture garden is sketched more than navigated—no single statue is used to complicate his path.

  * grade_story_wc_22.txt (grade=8.2)
    The jetty itself functions as micro-setting: splintered wood, cracks, tide-slick gaps constrain where seeds can lodge, turning the structure into both grave and cradle. Weathered planks “groaning under his weight” tie battlefield memory to present bodily pressure. Sensory hierarchy is POV-loyal—Elias notices wind direction, gull cry cadence, damp earth scent—never tourist-catalog. One minor slip: “vastness so narrow it felt like a wound” is vivid but conceptually abstract; a tactile bridge to the wound would have lifted this to 8.5+.

  * grade_story_wc_220.txt (grade=8.4)
    Scrapyard is not backdrop; the hollowed truck, rusted drum, and groaning metal constrain movement and hide the cylinder. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s tracker bias: scent of decay, wind-borne whispers, tactile wax. The leaf’s micro-setting recharges the final image—its sealed veins mirror the tunnel map he now accepts. One notch below 8.8 because spatial choreography inside the drum insertion is elided; we lose a beat of body-to-object scale.

  * grade_story_wc_221.txt (grade=8.6)
    The warped glass, dormant hum, and star-ribbons are filtered through Elias’s time-sense, creating a micro-setting that constrains his perception and ultimately licenses the anomaly. The compass and fluttering sketches function as portable setting-objects whose states evolve and charge the final image. Selective sensory hierarchy (cold railing, burning compass) keeps description purposeful and pressure-aligned.

  * grade_story_wc_222.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ice, altitude, and void are filtered through Lirien’s kinetic POV—frost-slick steps, breath fog, wind as invitation—so detail never stalls motion.

  * grade_story_wc_223.txt (grade=8.5)
    The whispering gallery’s acoustic feedback loop literally shapes tactics—speech becomes overheard witness, forcing her unscripted declaration; the pawnless chessboard micro-setting constrains the final renunciation. Sensory detail is selective (curved walls catching “forgotten breath,” palm on absent pawns). Spatial choreography holds as the pair walk the arc. Environment, body, and tool all charge the closing image, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_224.txt (grade=8.0)
    Mountain-bookstore fusion is immediately sensory—“shelves of books that spiraled upward in impossible geometry”—and constrains action: shelves become tunnels, air thickens, stone nestles in roots. Selective detail (damp earth, ink smell, mercury sheen) filters through Elias’s perceptual priorities; the feather’s texture functions as micro-setting that guides the final choice. Environment actively reshapes in response to the climax, reweighting the meaning of “home.”

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=8.8)
    Frosted cobbles, breath-still thatch, and humming thunder create a palpable hush that physically muffles Elias’s steps and choices.

Sensory triage favors chill and metallic taste, matching remorse texture.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=8.4)
    Bone towers, canyon echoes, and the spire are filtered through Lira’s artist eye, constraining her acoustic ritual and reframing her body as resonator. Selective sensory layering (ivory curves, ankle-curling mist, pulsing shard) feeds directly into action: she strokes, speaks, shatters hush. The spire re-enters at closure as the literal surface of consequence, satisfying 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean; no white-room drift.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=8.5)
    Workshop gears, acid-sea spray, and the statue’s pitted cheek are tactile, selective, and filtered through Elias’s obsessive gaze; every described surface either mirrors his scars or constrains his movement. The micro-setting of the cracked vial pressed to stone supplies the final trigger, charging the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean—kneeling, pressing forehead, scrambling for notes—within a single tilted room. Environment and body interleave without descriptive stall.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=8.8)
    Phosphorescent algae, salt in beard, and the shell’s cobalt-gold swirls are selective and POV-filtered. The cave’s geography is tracked cleanly: fork, slope, pool, ledge, tunnel—each spatial move alters possibility. The bioluminescent veins charge the final canvas image, meeting the 9+ gate. Minor repetition of “slick” and “damp” keeps it just sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=8.1)
    The cobalt lighthouse glass, the warped cork’s spiral grooves, and the cliff wind are not backdrop but tools that constrain action: Elias can’t shout into the storm; he must whisper through the cork’s etched path. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—salt-chipped paint, jasmine ghost—mirroring his narrowed attention. The garden scent functioning as micro-setting charges the final image when it lingers after the vial’s destruction, proving environment can bend to intent.

  * grade_story_wc_23.txt (grade=7.8)
    Signal station’s rusted ribs, salt wind, and moon-cast shadows filter through Elias’s sailor-senses; the censer acts as micro-setting that “clicks” to metal, constraining placement and pulse. Selective sensory triage—visual, tactile, acoustic—mirrors his narrowed grief. Spatial track stays clean across the single room.

  * grade_story_wc_230.txt (grade=8.6)
    The hanging orchard is not backdrop: slick paths keep others away, storm-gnawed roots supply the burial hole, and the wind’s voice becomes the eye’s chorus. Sensory triangulation—damp loam, flicker-shadows, groaning trunks—mirrors her internal slip toward exposure. The glass eye itself serves as micro-setting that constrains perception and final choice. Environment is indispensable to the climax image: “the orchard sighed” when the eye returns to soil, charging closure.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.1)
    The opal dock, salt-crusted glass, and tuning-fork hum are filtered through Elias’s professional eye, constraining his movement to a narrow stage that sharpens the final image. Mist breathes life back into the boutonnière—environment directly altering object state, which in turn alters Elias’s choice. Sensory hierarchy obeys lighthouse logic: sound and light override taste until the alpine scent breaches, marking the breach of memory. Micro-setting (body + tool) satisfies 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=8.1)
    Portolan chart, velvet drawer, bioluminescent blossoms—each sensory layer is filtered through Elias’s map-trained eye. The rising creek and glowing cavern constrain the final approach; the chip-as-key micro-setting charges the door image.

One missed beat: no tactile interaction with the stone or heat that could have sharpened the cost of staying.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=8.6)
    The cabin’s “groaning” logs, birch scroll’s brittle edges, and the mountain’s “teeth” are tactile, selective, and filter through Elias’s chronicler gaze. Space is stable: table, loft, latch all track cleanly. Weather howls but does not yet constrain choice—still, the final image of the opening door is charged by the claustrophobic interior, so environment shapes the stakes. Micro-setting (scroll) directly charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=8.6)
    The shop’s drips and fogged glass act as micro-setting, constraining Elias’s reliance on touch and sound; the screw’s cold threads supply the tactile pivot. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—smell absent, touch magnified. Weather lifts in sync with interior shift, but the causal direction stays character-ward, avoiding cheap pathetic fallacy. Specificity is selective and purposeful; no occupational over-exposition.

  * grade_story_wc_237.txt (grade=8.8)
    The floating moss platform, inkwell balanced on stone, and crow quill shards function as micro-setting that directly constrains action: sway dictates careful movement, table edge forces precarious balance, crystallized ink supplies the final mark.

Final image—raindrop onto newly glowing rune—marries environment and internal shift, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=8.8)
    The archive’s yellowed glue smell and the orchard’s held-breath hush are filtered through Elias’s professional nose and guilt, constraining his decision to stay until dawn. The perfume bottle acts as micro-setting: its cracked glass and sizzling drop physically shape the closure beat. Spatial choreography is tight—wire around neck, bottle on table, curator exits—no floating props. One hairline slip: ‘stone walls of the converted chapel’ is told, not sensed, but the error is sub-closure.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=8.0)
    The temple-library is evoked with visceral ribs-of-god shelves and dust-mote syllables; the arbitration stone serves as micro-setting that ultimately powers the closure.

The glass disc acts as micro-setting: its unplayed vibration is the physical corollary to her unspoken listening. Spatial choreography is clean—she steps out, palm to disc, between streetlamp hums—and the tunnel’s cool darkness literally presses the final silence home. Environment constrains her only tactic: listening instead of healing.

  * grade_story_wc_243.txt (grade=8.7)
    Jetty, twilight, and sea-lavender scent are filtered through Elias’s bereaved attention; the planks’ residual warmth and the gull’s tilted head constrain his stillness and timing. The locket acts as micro-setting that finally merges with the sea, charging the closure image. Selective sensory economy—no visual catalog of the town—keeps momentum. One nit: “blooming jetty” is metaphorical; if sea-lavender actually colonizes the boards, a tactile cue would nail the image.

  * grade_story_wc_244.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ivy-choked platform is not postcard scenery: its cracked surface forces Elias to stand, the gloom hides the logistician’s entrance, and the overgrown clock tower provides the exact slant of rust-gold light that frames the hand-off. The moon rock itself serves as micro-setting, handled twice and re-charged at the final image. Sensory hierarchy obeys Elias’s bias—smell of damp stone, faint hum in his palm—never tourist catalog.

Spatial choreography is immaculate; bodies and pillars stay tracked.

  * grade_story_wc_255.txt (grade=8.4)
    The courtyard is handled as a tactile workshop, not a postcard: kiln-warm glass shard, overlapping leaf-scales, scent of molten silica. Each sensory hit is filtered through Elias’s hue-less perception, so every detail doubles as character data. The shard’s “spectrum he couldn’t name” lands as both setting and culminating image. Only minor: jasmine’s re-bloom and re-wither could use one more causal tether to glass or pigment.

  * grade_story_wc_256.txt (grade=8.6)
    The carbide lens functions as micro-setting: its refracted light and later vibration physically constrain Elias’s attention and trigger the final sync.

  * grade_story_wc_346.txt (grade=9.1)
    Environment, body, and tool converge: the cracked clock-face, invisible pane, and salt-stained puppet constrain Elias’s choices and charge the final image. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven—he studies fractures, feels silence “hum,” hears glass “sing.” Spatial choreography is immaculate across the single scene. Meets 9+ gate: pane and puppet are micro-settings that alter tactics and resonate in the last line.

  * grade_story_wc_347.txt (grade=8.5)
    Environment is never backdrop: the cliff’s stone cracks determine root-growth, the frost clock forces hurried scattering, the brass birds’ shadows dictate stealth. The warm nut-as-micro-setting literally rewrites navigable space. Selective sensory filtering—damp soil, dying light, shriek of wings—keeps detail urgent and POV-bound. One minor spatial drift: the man “stumbles into view” yet Mira remains kneeling; relative distance unclear for half a beat.

  * grade_story_wc_348.txt (grade=7.8)
    Ravine, moss, river foam, and chrysalis are tactile, selective, and filtered through polymer-scientist perception. The braided channel literally constrains her physical path and metaphorically maps her new design logic, charging the final image. Weather and season stay implicit, keeping economy. Spatial choreography is secure; no floating rooms.

  * grade_story_wc_349.txt (grade=8.6)
    The crystalline library, prismatic skylight, and bottled moonlight are tactile, selective, and filtered through Elias’s perceptual bias; the setting actively guides his choice—selling the bottle literally empties the stall and opens the cloud-door. Sensory hierarchy narrows under pressure: ozone, cool glass, warm coin. Spatial choreography is clean; no floating props. The final image reuses the cloud-sea first seen in the opening, recharging it with new possibility after the loss.

  * grade_story_wc_35.txt (grade=8.7)
    Desert-fortress, salt-rain, coral ice—each filters through Maren’s chef-perception (“taste the rain’s memory”) and constrains the final choice: the warming coral under her palm literalizes the thaw. Spatial choreography stays clean; no white-room moments. Micro-setting (her own body as tasting instrument) charges the closure, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_350.txt (grade=7.8)
    The tower’s brass hands, stone steps, and lantern glow are filtered through Mara’s tuner’s ear; sound (scuffing boots, chime timbre) dominates sight, a nice occupational bias. The cuckoo weight’s polished iron reappears at start and end, charging the final image. Spatial choreography stays clear; no impossible bodies. Micro-setting (the weight as metronome) constrains the closing rhythm.

  * grade_story_wc_351.txt (grade=7.9)
    Canyon moonlight, mirror fractures, and dust are filtered through Lena’s tactile attention; the wall’s “held breath” pressure guides the final angle adjustment. Spatial choreography stays clean in a single kneeling move. The mirror-as-micro-setting constrains the climax, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_352.txt (grade=8.4)
    The grotto’s serpentine coils, mist curtain, and inverted stalactites are tactile and bias-filtered through Elara’s cataloguing gaze. Environment actively shapes action: moisture rises to imprint her soles, moss flares at touch, blank book sits at gravity’s pivot. These constraints alter her movement and cue the final image. Micro-setting (the manuscript) also functions as tool, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_353.txt (grade=8.8)
    Alder damp, moss give, and hair-line cracks are filtered through a wood-carver’s professional eye; every tactile detail later guides the strumming tactic. The porcelain’s “smooth white orb” contrasts physically and acoustically, charging the final resonance. Environment literally channels sound; without the cracked alder and grove hush the climax fails—meets 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_354.txt (grade=7.9)
    Magnetic nexus is more mood than constraint until the final beat when the pulsing stones actively shape the visible symbols; that late participation lifts the score. Earlier, the violet-rust sky and uneven gravity are vivid but decorative. The basalt stone serves as micro-setting and is handled twice, earning its keep. To reach 8.8 the environment would need to frustrate or enable a specific tactic before the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_355.txt (grade=8.6)
    The slanted star-latticed roof, solder smell, and lantern shadows create a tactile micro-setting that literally hums under the oscillator; the workshop’s acoustic properties constrain how Elias tests pitch. The diary clasp itself functions as setting-in-miniature, its grooves and brass temperature guiding fingertip attention. Final image of fireworks light splashing over the open diary fuses external and internal atmosphere, satisfying the 9+ gate by charging the last image through environmental overlay.

  * grade_story_wc_356.txt (grade=8.4)
    Treetop village is sketched with swift, tactile economy: creaking bridges, moss-lined balcony, vines children swing from. Sensory hierarchy obeys Mira’s olfactory bias—every breeze carries data—so description never feels touristic. The wrapped doodle paper and seed’s “faint scent of decay” act as micro-settings that constrain her next move (unwrap, record). Spatial choreography stays clean across the single balcony scene; no floating bodies or lost anchors.

  * grade_story_wc_357.txt (grade=9.1)
    The floating rock arches aren’t backdrop; their undersides become sky during inversion, forcing Lira to land on what was once ceiling. The silver water ribbon and condensation-slick stone constrain navigation and physically guide her to the echo-grove, charging the final image when seeds rise past the same arches.

  * grade_story_wc_358.txt (grade=8.1)
    Container maze as sentient pressure-cooker is viscerally anchored—angled stacks, salt-rust smell, scanner flare on steel—each sensory pick is filtered through Elias’s disaster-honed gaze and directly shapes his path; the thermal bloom inside metal is the detail that finally weaponizes the setting, passing the 9+ gate by constraining the exit.

  * grade_story_wc_359.txt (grade=8.6)
    Ice-cavern geometry is tracked through vibration, echo, and aurora ribbons; the body is present in trembling hands and breath that fogs. The smallest bell catching aurora light becomes the micro-object that charges the final beam. Environment constrains tactics: the chisel’s echo dictates tempo, and the cavern’s hush must literally be sculpted before the sheet will sing. Specificity is selective—no tourist catalog—yet every sensory pick advances stakes or mood.

  * grade_story_wc_36.txt (grade=8.1)
    Thunder-echo Range is more than postcard: footstep tremors, damp earth, cavern air that “smelled… older” all filter through Elias’s hyper-alert guilt. Flute-as-micro-setting qualifies: its rising heat and shifting glyphs constrain when and how he acts. The driftwood markers evolve from external trail to internal re-patterning, charging the final weave. One slip: “avalanchingly quiet” is used once as adverbial flourish without sensory ripple elsewhere.

  * grade_story_wc_360.txt (grade=8.7)
    The topaz dome refracts dying starlight into liquid-gold pools that mirror Elias’s fracturing inner light; the workshop itself becomes a prism constraining perception. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: ink smell of parchment and copper precedes cosmic grandeur, grounding the metaphysical in tactile labor. Spatial choreography is clean—fragment on bench, press, woman’s silent boots—every object is within arm’s reach and charged. The vanishing stars evolve from backdrop to final extinguished lamp, reconfiguring the dome from sanctuary to void.

  * grade_story_wc_361.txt (grade=8.1)
    Aurora light, ozone scent, and shifting stones are filtered through courier perception and guide her final inward pivot. The ridgeway itself breathes, constraining her stance; micro-setting (pendant against collarbone) doubles as environment. Selective sensory hierarchy holds; no static postcarding. Meets 9- gate: the setting’s living breath charges the closing image.

  * grade_story_wc_362.txt (grade=7.8)
    Quartz arbor, crystalline branches, spectral shards, frost veins—selective sensory triangulation keeps the micro-setting tactile and purposive. Mist, cold, and refracted color track consistently and constrain attention (he studies frost because fieldwork is frozen). Prism-as-tool recurs with changing thermal state, charging the final image. Spatial choreography clean; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_363.txt (grade=8.7)
    Orchard, bamboo, and bead act as micro-settings that constrain every move: the bead’s warmth decides departure; the crumbling spires force final acceptance. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true—silk threads “damp with her own breath” fuses body and place. One minor drift: city description is sparser, but the ruin mirrors internal desolation, so function remains intact.

  * grade_story_wc_364.txt (grade=8.1)
    Floating rock arches, root pockets, and ore-glitter are filtered through Elias’s miner-blacksmith gaze, giving functional specificity. The silk’s cool, color-shifting surface is rendered through haptic detail that later constrains the sealing action. Spatial choreography inside the mine is coherent—lantern shadows, slick walls, fissure mouth—tracking body position without drift. Environment directly shapes tactics: delicate arches forbid brute closure, demanding the silk finesse.

  * grade_story_wc_365.txt (grade=8.1)
    Ozone, rust, flicker of emergency lights, and the cracked console give tactile anchoring; the shard’s pulse against Kael’s ribs merges body, tool, and setting. The repair bay functions as micro-setting: its collapsing architecture and erratic scanner readings directly constrain whether the gate can be opened, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_366.txt (grade=8.7)
    The lantern room’s soot-streaked glass, iron stairs, and rattling panes are filtered through Elias’s mariner gaze; every detail is touched or heard. The spiral of stones functions as micro-setting that literally rewrites the room’s language and constrains his final choice. Sensory hierarchy narrows to chill, flame, and the click of pebbles under pressure. Environment is not backdrop; it is the dialogue partner that forces his reply.

  * grade_story_wc_367.txt (grade=8.6)
    The emerald beam, glass walls, and star-wick are tactile tools that constrain every move; adjusting the lantern’s angle literally bends destiny. Salt-laced dark and refracted starlight narrow perception to the immediate act of weaving. The lighthouse itself functions as micro-setting—its spiral stairs and curved glass dictate pacing and bodily choreography, charging the final mirror-gesture.

  * grade_story_wc_368.txt (grade=8.5)
    The floating tea house is not postcard scenery; its hovering granite and rice-paper walls filter light that literally dyes the floor and directs the protagonist’s gaze. The morpho wing acts as micro-setting, constraining how he handles color and memory. Sun trails and valley mist are tracked with sensory specificity that mirrors his internal state without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_369.txt (grade=8.1)
    Tower, storm, moonlight, and broken brass are filtered through Elias’s maintenance-eye; sawdust, damp, and mercury-like moonlight constrain movement and charge the final image. Spatial choreography stays clean; weather affects choice (climb, balcony stance). Micro-setting (sextant body) directly enables closure.

  * grade_story_wc_37.txt (grade=7.9)
    Mica window, vines, and liquid-gold fruit are tactile, refracted through Elara’s wonder; the greenhouse air (“overripe fruit and damp earth”) grounds every beat. Spatial tracking stays coherent—boots sink, vines coil, seed is planted—though the village square is sketched in two lines. The window recurs at closure, glowing, but never constrains choice; hence capped below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_370.txt (grade=8.0)
    Beeswax-and-parchment scent, impossible spiral shelves, and the humming silence tome are vivid, selective, and filtered through Elias’s curator gaze. The map-book reconfigures city streets into a labyrinth that literally routes the final action—setting constrains choice and charges the exit image. No sensory checklist; each detail either mirrors solitude or enables the paradox logic. Micro-setting (invitation, map) carries the weight normally given to city geography, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_371.txt (grade=7.9)
    Atmosphere is selective and POV-filtered: frost, yeast scent, damp soil, steam from tea—each detail is tactile and stakes-bearing. The tea-house micro-setting supplies the table for the bread offering and the window-ledge for the seeds, so environment constrains the final choice. The “overgrown palace courtyard” never complicates movement or resource, keeping it just shy of indispensable.

  * grade_story_wc_372.txt (grade=8.7)
    Ice-cathedral library is vividly sketched through glinting shelves, sagging under neglect, and the brass lantern slot; cold is made tactile via breath-curl and glove ritual. Spatial choreography holds as Elias moves from shelf to lantern to projected image. The setting constrains the final choice—only this frozen archive can host the vow—meeting the 9+ gate. A sliver of headroom remains for even sharper sensory compression.

  * grade_story_wc_373.txt (grade=8.4)
    Salt-rust-rum triad and lantern fingers give tactile noir; the pier’s rot and market geography stay coherent, guiding stealth movement. The watch fob’s brass glint becomes micro-setting that constrains the final negotiation. Weather and wider town remain off-stage, acceptable at this length; one adjective stack (“damp chill creeping through her wool coat”) slightly blurs sensory hierarchy.

  * grade_story_wc_374.txt (grade=8.7)
    Lavender Bluff’s aurora and the root-election are sensuously anchored and constrain the final image—trees uprooting make the cosmic intimate. The clearing’s spatial choreography is clean; rain sphere in the man’s hand tracks tactically. Micro-setting (ring, taste) alters choice and charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_375.txt (grade=8.3)
    The amethyst cathedral is rendered through Elias’s charcoal-stained touch and the violet shadows that guide his gaze; the lock’s cold hum and the painting’s flaking paint constrain his next move. The cave’s light reappears in the final image, tightening the visual cadence and charging the threshold.

  * grade_story_wc_376.txt (grade=8.1)
    Glass-domed bruise-sky, fogged purifiers, brittle blue bloom under cracked glass—selective sensory triad that mirrors her wavering integrity. The zinc plate’s cold jagged edge is returned to twice, constraining her handling and prefiguring the floorboard seam; setting materially guides the final discovery.

  * grade_story_wc_377.txt (grade=8.7)
    Bluff wind, frost bite, and spinning iceberg light are filtered through Elias’s tuner-biased senses. The sculpture’s silver arms and melting shard track spatially and constrain later tactics (must find next pigment source). Final image of sapphire lattice crystallizes the setting into the closure beat.

  * grade_story_wc_378.txt (grade=8.8)
    The dome, hydroponic tubes, and blackened petals function as micro-setting that constrains Eli’s pruning choices and finally feeds the fire.

  * grade_story_wc_379.txt (grade=7.8)
    Courtyard, dawn light, and the rusted mailbox are sketched with honeyed, sensory economy; the brass locket’s weight is re-invoked at the end, charging the final image. Spatial choreography is clear in the silent witness stance. Environment does not constrain Elara’s choices, so the 9+ gate fails, but atmosphere is integral rather than decorative.

  * grade_story_wc_38.txt (grade=8.8)
    Corroded glass, salt-stiff coat, bioluminescent algae, and the coral-fused hatch are tactile, selective, and directly gate her progress; the dice and journal function as micro-setting that constrain her decoding choices and charge the final image with pulsing light.

  * grade_story_wc_380.txt (grade=8.7)
    Salt-choked docks and crystal vats are filtered through Marlowe’s ritualized attention; every sensory note—ozone, brine, condensation—guides his next move. The chamber itself becomes a micro-setting that actively pulls his body, constraining the final choice. One more tactile beat inside the vats’ pull would have nudged 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_381.txt (grade=8.1)
    Brook, damp earth, and origami form a tight micro-setting that constrains the final gesture—water must be present for the dissolve. Sensory hierarchy favors hush and coolness, mirroring internal calm without over-symbolism. Spatial choreography is clean: kneel → place → release → walk away. Nighttime “nocturnal haven” is generic, but selective detail keeps it from white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_382.txt (grade=7.8)
    Rooftop garden is sketched with sensory economy—whisper of meteors, scent of herbs—filtered through Elara’s memorial purpose. The embroidered shawl and worn brass seal provide micro-setting that constrains her grip and memory. Spatial choreography is clear: bench, bowl exchange, bodies beside parapet. While the broader city remains a silhouette, the meteor shower functions as dynamic ceiling that times the recognition beat; environment is not just backdrop but clock for the closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_383.txt (grade=8.0)
    The velvet garden absorbs sound and exhales resonance—an environment that literally dampens external noise so internal memory can surface; this constrains Elias’s options and charges the final flare. Sensory triangulation (dew-weighted petals, hush, distant waves) is selective and POV-filtered. Spatial choreography is stable: cliff below, roses at center, shimmer at heart. Micro-setting (the seashell) doubles as setting-object, handled twice with rising temperature cue.

  * grade_story_wc_384.txt (grade=8.4)
    Marble sanctuary, stalactite drips, and aurora light are filtered through Lian’s calibrated attention—each drip marks elapsed time, the shifting colors mirror her rising clarity. The rose thorn and inkstone act as micro-setting that constrain her final gesture. Spatial choreography is clean: workbench → altar → doorway. One hairline slip: “vaulted ceiling dripping with stalactites that wept” is a touch ornate, but it doesn’t stall momentum or dull the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_385.txt (grade=8.1)
    Starlit serpentine stone, ozone, shell-edge biting skin—details are selective, tactile, and filtered through Liora’s echo-tuned senses. The nexus functions as micro-setting: its humming ground and shadowed alcoves supply the progressive disclosure path that literally steers her steps. The fused shell in the final image is the charged object that reconfigures meaning, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_386.txt (grade=8.7)
    The shrine, globe, and glacier constrain every move: warmth of the melted glass against ice, candle limit against darkness, final ripple in the globe charging the last image. Sensory selection stays urgent—saltwater smell in sheets, breath fog on ice—never tourist catalog. Spatial choreography is clean; Mara’s body and the altar remain anchored across beats. Environment mirrors interior: the “groaning” ice externalizes her relief after the choice to seal the truth.

  * grade_story_wc_387.txt (grade=8.3)
    Mountain village, rain-slick stones, firefly constellations, and the bamboo whisk as micro-setting are vividly filtered through Ren’s mender-eye; the parapet’s height and whispering wind materially shape the final hush, giving the closing image its hush-charge.

  * grade_story_wc_388.txt (grade=8.3)
    Orchard is rendered through tactile pressure: respirator filters past prime, spongy soil swallowing boots, warm untouched circle at the end. The glowing fruit and blackened hollow tree serve as interactive props—Elias handles the nest of paper, kneels on the stillpoint soil—so environment constrains action. Micro-setting (hollow tree) doubles as archive, integrating setting with plot. Sufficient specificity and functional use for high-band.

  * grade_story_wc_389.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stormlit observatory, cobalt portico, and lightning-scarred ridge are vividly etched and return to constrain the final confrontation; the cold glass bite recurs as tactile price. Spatial clarity holds from dome to valley platform; weather actively limits descent and frames the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_39.txt (grade=8.0)
    Salt-crusted wood, warped boards, and the music-box brass give tactile specificity; the loft itself never physically constrains choices, but the micro-setting of the jars-on-shelves becomes the charged final image, satisfying the 9+ gate by reconfiguring the space as archive rather than hide-out.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=8.6)
    Frost-cracked pier, brass resonator, whalebone harness—selective sensory triplet that constrains movement and tactics. The lighthouse’s sonic beam is not backdrop but tool, turned into weapon mid-scene. Drift-ice marina’s groan mirrors Elias’s teeth-ache, integrating setting with physiology. Micro-setting (wrist-mounted dial, tuning fork on ice) directly enables the vibrational duel.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=8.1)
    Basalt spires, ozone scent, and moon-fractured ice are filtered through Elias’s tracker gaze; the lake’s “skin” metaphor governs the final step, turning setting into hazard and promise. Micro-setting succeeds; macro geography (city, valleys) is atmospheric only and never constrains tactics, capping the score short of exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.1)
    Damp concrete, flickering fluoros, half-hidden door—selective sensory triangulation keeps tunnel present without catalog. Lantern brass warms palm, weight shifts in bag—object-as-setting constrains the final choice to carry it back toward danger. Spatial choreography is clean: pipes, crates, distances track. Micro-setting (door etchings matching lantern) charges closure image, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=8.4)
    The shop’s lemon-oil scent, ticking shelves, and Kael’s spider-leg fingers are selective and POV-colored. The heart itself becomes the micro-setting that constrains the final choice. Storm light breaking through clouds is reprised as the last image, recharging the opening atmosphere.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=8.7)
    Acid-sea workshop is not backdrop but ticking life-support; its dying groans meter Elias’s urgency. Brass gears, copper etchings, and the hunter’s arrow constrain literal assembly steps. Sensory hierarchy favors taste of copper and bone-rattle resonance—choices narrow as fumes rise. Final image of stilled sea reconfigures the entire corroded world in one silent beat.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=7.8)
    Archive static, server glow, and the frayed patch give tactile anchors; the “digital graveyard” metaphor is controlled. Spatial clarity wavers once: the server-room video appears without confirming whether Lena is watching from her desk or has physically entered the facility.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.1)
    Orchard-lighthouse-ice triad is vividly sketched in compressed, sensory strokes; the “gnarled apple trees clawed at the frigid air” anchors POV bias. Micro-setting (the crystal warming in palm) constrains the decisive beat. Spatial choreography stays clean; only the mirrors’ interior layout remains white-room.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=8.0)
    Drift-ice marina is filtered through Elias’s slowed perception—groaning planks, salt wind, frostbitten fingers handing tea—so environment constrains where he can stand, what he hears, when he offers the parasol. Micro-setting (parasol tip as tactile anchor) charges the final image. One minor slip: spatial relation between cot cluster and dock edge remains vague.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=7.8)
    The amber pavilion canvas rippling “like a living thing” and the frost-bent vines supply tactile, POV-filtered specificity that mirrors internal give. Environment does not directly constrain the final choice (no one is blocked by a locked gate or weather), so the 9-band gate is missed, but atmosphere is vivid and purposeful.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=8.7)
    The pavilion’s groaning slats and the parapet’s sub-sand mechanics are tactile, selective, and directly constrain the walker’s kneeling beat and the final thread emergence. Micro-setting (mask, wooden floor as conduit) functions as setting and charges the closure image. No environment or object cap applies; the kinetic parapet reappears and reweights meaning at the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lavender petals, rusted struts, and the dove-gray case recur with sensory economy; the vines-softened-window light directly shapes the photograph Elias takes, so environment constrains the culminating act. Spatial anchors arrive by line 5 and hold. The factory’s husk is more than postcard: its broken glass refracts the dawn that Elias captures, welding setting to closure image.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=8.6)
    Library micro-setting—beeswax scent, groaning timbers, slanted dawn light—filters through Elias’s selective attention and directly enables the sonic experiment. The crystal functions as portable setting/tool that constrains every tactical move. Spatial choreography remains clean across desk, shelves, temple-press. Meets 9+ gate: the crystal’s sonic properties charge the final image; no cap applied.

  * grade_story_wc_41.txt (grade=8.0)
    Fog, rusted wire faces, and damp earth are filtered through the prophet’s hush-seeking ear, creating a sensory hierarchy that mirrors memory loss.

Selective detail—static silence, chalk worn smooth—keeps economy tight while sustaining tidal longing.

  * grade_story_wc_42.txt (grade=8.5)
    Lunar observatory above cloud-line is sketched with star-pooled silver, humming stabilizers, fogged view-finder—selective, POV-filtered. The clock hand becomes micro-setting: its relentless spin physically replaces the shutter and dictates exposure length, directly constraining the climactic shot. Spatial choreography stays clean: tools, pod, collapsing dome track without drift. Environment mirrors internal state (shaking mirrors trembling hands) without overt symbolism. Meets 9+ gate: tool charges final image.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.6)
    The frosted-glass solarium, lavender-rain air, and shared vinyl fragments are filtered through Elias’s musician perception and constrain every beat: the room’s hush demands the soft strum, the scent cues memory, the broken disk must be handled gently. Spatial choreography is immaculate—guitar case down, chair drawn, shard accepted—no floating props. Micro-setting (the pocket, the pillow pouch) functions as charged environment. Slight deduction for “radiant haven” functioning more as mood than obstacle, keeping it below 8.8.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=8.1)
    Floating isle, brass telescope, ozone scent, and mirror-chamber are sketched with selective sensory strokes that feed mood. The observatory’s circular depression and key-slot constrain the decisive action, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial tracking stays coherent through descent. Detail never stalls momentum; world rules remain internally consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_45.txt (grade=8.0)
    The garden’s “willow-bent rules” and nameless flower-colors create a tactile micro-setting that actively guides Lena’s choices (the apple root yields teeth, the soil gives up the map). Sensory selection is POV-filtered (“smelled of damp earth and something older”) and the hedge maze’s shifting paths constrain her movement in the final beat. The environment never merely decorates; it supplies the tools that resolve the stakes, satisfying the 9+ gate for constraint.

  * grade_story_wc_46.txt (grade=8.1)
    Grotto mist, bioluminescent walls, and cold water constrain her pace and make the pearl’s stillness tactile. Sea glass recurs as micro-setting, charging the final image when its refracted hues echo in the village dawn. Selective sensory triage keeps the 780-word count lean.

  * grade_story_wc_47.txt (grade=8.3)
    The moss-choked server rack functions as micro-setting that constrains the final gesture: only the rusted hook makes the hanging possible. Sensory triage is POV-filtered (“drip of thawing icicles” heard, not catalogued). Spatial choreography is tracked cleanly from threshold to hub. Environment mirrors interior thaw without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_48.txt (grade=7.8)
    The feral nexus is rendered through rot-paper scent, silt sucking at boots, and mist that almost forms sentences—details filtered by a writer’s perceptual bias. The spiral shell functions as micro-setting, its worn edge and hum constraining Elias’s attention and returning in the final image to charge the parting moment. Spatial choreography is clean: river current, shore, three cameos appear and vanish without positional drift. Environment never forces a tactical shift, however, keeping the score below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_49.txt (grade=8.6)
    The arbor is rendered through mint scent, spiralled bark, and the tactile vine bracelet; these micro-details constrain her singing posture and later charge the golden glow, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial anchors arrive by line 5—dawn, roots, window—so orientation is secure.

  * grade_story_wc_5.txt (grade=8.5)
    Subarctic crater orchard is more than postcard: frost hardens soil, twilight angle catches the button, silence presses like snow—each filters through Elias’s attention and constrains his slow ritual. Micro-setting objects (teacup, key, mirror, button) form the pattern that physically guides the seal; their discarded history charges the final stillness. Spatial choreography is clean—circle built, match struck, jar settles. Environment mirrors internal state without overt symbolism, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_50.txt (grade=8.6)
    Marble/quartz walls, skylight angles, and brass gears are filtered through Elias’s jeweler-eye; every surface either hums, refracts, or yields a tool (quartz shard pries gears). The cavern’s acoustic hum and shifting light pools constrain his ritual—he times the repair to the weakest light—so environment actively shapes tactics. Micro-setting supremacy: the timer’s brass casing temperature against palm becomes the emotional barometer. One minor over-description loop—“light pooled…like liquid gold” right after “light bled…hues”—keeps it from the 9 band.

  * grade_story_wc_51.txt (grade=8.6)
    Bronze grotto ribs, kerosene brass, and starlight-slit ceiling are not backdrop but instruments: the thinnest north wall dictates flame orientation, the drip-rate modulates from whisper to song as the air calcifies. Micro-setting (lamp burner, her palm) constrains the decisive tactile choice, passing the 9+ gate; only the single adjective “boundary-lessly” momentarily blurs spatial logic.

  * grade_story_wc_52.txt (grade=8.8)
    Rain-beaded skylight and warped floorboards constrain pacing (slippers scuff) and mood; the ash blank functions as micro-setting that literally resists then yields to the knife. Sensory hierarchy is POV-driven: bergamot steam, damp wool, wood warmth. One minor lapse: city hum remains off-stage postcard. Final image of softened edges by diffused glow charges the closure.

    The lagoon’s “mirror that refused to hold a single truth” is not postcard scenery; it supplies the literal surface that returns her younger self and forces the final stance. Micro-setting of the rusted platform creaking under her boots anchors body-in-space and times the beat before immersion. Sensory triage favors touch and temperature over visual catalog, mirroring her scavenger bias. Environment constrains the only possible confrontation—no other terrain could stage this negotiation.

  * grade_story_wc_54.txt (grade=8.0)
    Terminal’s collapsed lattice, condensation-fogged greenhouse, and brass sextant are tactile and specific; the greenhouse glass charging the final image satisfies the 9+ gate by constraining her next act—she sketches its irrigation math, so environment shapes choice. Spatial choreography stays clean across one continuous scene.

  * grade_story_wc_55.txt (grade=8.5)
    The crystal forecourt evolves from boyhood myth to adult reckoning, constraining Elias’s final kneel; its quartz hum is the literal sound-track of closure. Micro-setting inside the Spire is equally tactile: scattered watch-tools, oil scent on skin, blanket in the corner—all used, not catalogued. Spatial choreography is clean: alley → gate → forecourt, no impossible jumps. Weather (overnight rain) is causal, making stones sing and bear tracks plausible. One cap: no environment-driven tactic during the walk; still, the setting recharges the ending image, satisfying 9- gate.

  * grade_story_wc_56.txt (grade=8.4)
    The twilight canal’s damp planks, lapping water, and lantern flickers are filtered through the seeker’s tuned ear for silence; the setting actively guides choice—only the hush barge draws him. The mirror-crate’s metallic corner and impossible weight constrain the final lift, turning setting into antagonist. Micro-setting (pocket sundial against thigh, salt-rot air) doubles as tool and atmosphere. While larger world rules remain tacit, the immediate environment is irreplaceable to the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_57.txt (grade=8.6)
    Dock, snow, fog, and salt-stiff rope are filtered through Elias’s haptic priorities; the fulgurite micro-setting reappears to charge the final image. Environment constrains visibility and thus the pace of decoding, but no physical property of the dock or weather actively narrows his options—hence the slight gap from 9.

  * grade_story_wc_58.txt (grade=8.1)
    Garden decay is selective and POV-filtered; damp earth scent and spiraling leaves mirror her fatigue without overt symbolism. The golden thread serves as micro-setting/object that charges the final image, satisfying the 9+ gate. Spatial choreography is clean in the single-scene frame. A hair more tactile interaction with the soil during burial would have tightened environment-to-choice linkage.

  * grade_story_wc_59.txt (grade=8.9)
    Micro-setting triumph: the suspended palace’s groaning chains and cracked glass constrain every beat; the brass contraption’s salvaged gears act as secondary “setting” that fails and is discarded. Sensory hierarchy filters through Kaelen’s obsessive attention—dust, metallic screech, candle flicker—mirroring internal decay. Final image of still-damp wings catching candlelight recharges earlier “liquid gold” motif, satisfying 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_6.txt (grade=8.6)
    Obsidian water, black sand, and the coin form a micro-setting trilogy that constrains the final teaching moment: the sand literally slips through fingers to embody loss, the lagoon mirrors shifting clouds to cue time, the coin warms against skin to signal readiness. Sensory selection stays tight to Lena’s fire-sharpened attention. One minor lapse: “kelp-drift peace” is told, not felt.

  * grade_story_wc_60.txt (grade=8.0)
    Fountain basins, cracked stone, velvet color, and the glass box itself act as micro-settings that constrain movement and focus perception. The constellated door reprises the box panes, charging the final image. Selective sensory triage—dust, damp, rust—mirrors Elara’s narrowed attention. Setting never blocks choreography; spatial track stays clean.

  * grade_story_wc_61.txt (grade=8.9)
    The nebula-garden is not postcard scenery; its petals physically respond to sonar pings, constraining Elias’s tactic and charging the final image with remembered light.

Spatial choreography is clean: gear pressed, ship powers down, petals close.

  * grade_story_wc_62.txt (grade=8.3)
    Granite dust, lavender, rusted iron, monarch wings—each sense detail is filtered through Elias’s stonemason eye and grief-narrowed attention. The greenhouse micro-setting constrains movement: broken benches force him to “unspool” the ribbon along the exact path his father walked, tethering memory to physical space. Twilight hues on the ribbon return in the butterfly sky, charging the final image with chromatic echo. No geography drift; weather and decay affect pacing and breath.

  * grade_story_wc_63.txt (grade=8.7)
    Obsidian ridge, spray-slick climb, and brass bob are tactile and selective; the tower door’s “pulse” under Elias’s palm fuses setting with character perception. The rake handle doubles as micro-setting and conscience-archive, constraining the final ritual. While the town itself is sketched lightly, the ridge and tower supply immediate spatial pressure and mirror the moral sharpening; environment is not merely backdrop—it enables the climactic act.

  * grade_story_wc_64.txt (grade=8.9)
    The cobalt silo’s rusted curves, velveteen gloom, and finger-smoothed wall corner function as micro-setting that literally guides Elias’s path and final decision. Sensory hierarchy is POV-true: gardener notices soil scent, thread texture, wall wear. The environment constrains the choice to plant roses in that exact niche, meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_65.txt (grade=8.6)
    The obsidian spire’s blade-like geometry and the frost-melt rivulets mirror the shift from stasis to possibility; the kingfisher quill’s iridescence constrains the only possible instrument for authorship. Selective sensory detail (scent of frost and parchment, ink clinging to feather) is filtered through Elara’s cartographer gaze. Environment and tool jointly charge the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_66.txt (grade=8.3)
    The ember alcove is rendered through scent, temperature, and the radio’s pulse, anchoring time and place within the first 120 words. Micro-setting—the jar, the dial glow—functions as both prop and constraint, guiding Elias’s ritual. Spatial choreography stays clean; no floating bodies or impossible moves. The mist outside remains a backdrop rather than an active pressure, keeping the score just below the 9-band gate.

  * grade_story_wc_67.txt (grade=8.4)
    The gallery’s warped perspective and breathing paintings are filtered through Elias’s grief-sight; the rocking chair micro-setting anchors every beat.

The vanishing point motif repays in the last image without overt symbolic signposting.

  * grade_story_wc_68.txt (grade=7.9)
    Reek, damp stone, and brackish water ground the reader quickly; the chronometer cog performs as micro-setting, its “brass teeth worn smooth” anchoring texture. Spatial choreography stays coherent through the single location. Environment does not actively constrain the final choice, so it charges atmosphere more than tactics, keeping the score sub-9.

  * grade_story_wc_69.txt (grade=8.6)
    The velvet library, cinnamon air, and mother-of-pearl rosette are filtered through Elara’s preservationist gaze, so sensory detail doubles as exposition. The zither functions as micro-setting: its fragility constrains tempo and forces the choir to lean in, directly shaping rehearsal tactics. Autumn leaves mirror internal decay but never overplay symbolism. Spatial choreography stays clean; bodies circle the piano bench without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_7.txt (grade=8.0)
    The rusted greenhouse is tactile and constraining—broken glass, sagging benches—its decay directly shapes her pruning labor and the final image of seedlings leaving the ruin; sensory selection stays tight to Mara's chef-eye for growth and rot.

  * grade_story_wc_70.txt (grade=8.0)
    Lightning tower, drone hives, and nectar dusk are sketched with selective sensory strokes—“copper veins,” “wings too heavy with static”—that filter through Elias’s stake in wonder. The tower’s dimmed core and the matchbox’s blue flame are micro-settings that directly constrain the final choice. Spatial choreography is clear across the gate, base, and core moves. A hair more tactile handling of the lacquer box could have pushed it past the 8.8 gate.

  * grade_story_wc_71.txt (grade=8.0)
    Bay, dock, warped door-gap, and pocketed shard are tactile and selective; salt air and violet dust constrain attention. The leaning house is a micro-setting that literally pressures choice. While no object alters tactics after insertion, the shard’s residue in the closing breath keeps the environment charged.

  * grade_story_wc_72.txt (grade=8.4)
    Algae-slick marble, rusted helmet, violet twilight in glass—each detail is sensory, selective, and filtered through the diver’s urgent gaze. The half-buried tree and fissure evolve from scenery to tool, constraining the final insertion and charging the closing image. Spatial choreography is clean: distance from statue to tree tracked in one steady approach. Environment never stalls momentum; it tightens choices.

  * grade_story_wc_73.txt (grade=7.9)
    Stone scent, worn smoothness, and the die’s chipped corner give tactile anchors that return in the final image. The staircase’s tilt is a micro-setting shift that constrains next steps. Selective sensory detail (no visual excess) keeps momentum. Environment directly shapes the final choice, satisfying the 9+ gate.

    The greenhouse functions as micro-setting: glass panes fogged by her breath mirror the smog outside and literally constrain air quality, shaping her decision to stay awake and paint. Sensory selection—wet earth, crushed mint, sour yellow haze—filters through an artist’s bias and stays purposeful. Spatial choreography is clean; no anachronisms. Tool-as-setting (moon-tipped brush) charges the final image by holding literal moonlight. Meets 9+ gate: environment and tool jointly constrain tactics and are reweighted in the closing glow.

  * grade_story_wc_75.txt (grade=8.1)
    Mist-soaked grotto, cold ovens, opera-glass tint—details are selective, POV-filtered, and return in the final image. Waterfall roar threading every room keeps setting active; micro-setting (warm loaf in cold museum) charges the closing beat.

  * grade_story_wc_76.txt (grade=8.4)
    Black-teeth island, salt-corroded brass, kelp-licked rocks—every detail is filtered through Elias’s tactile, maker gaze. The lighthouse itself becomes a micro-setting tool: its reversed beam is the final environmental constraint, charging the closure. One minor slack: tide physics after the rewind are asserted (“slower this time”) rather than shown through action, keeping the score just under exemplary.

  * grade_story_wc_77.txt (grade=8.1)
    Funhouse is rendered through sensory triad: rust-sugar air, warped glass, collapsed booth—each filtered by Elias’s bodily unease. Micro-setting (opera-clasp eye, Polaroid) constrains the final choice: he must unclasp and tear the photo to exit. Spatial choreography is coherent across the mirror lunge and retreat. Environment is indispensable to tactics and final image, meeting the 9+ gate for this category.

  * grade_story_wc_78.txt (grade=8.1)

  * grade_story_wc_8.txt (grade=8.1)
    Station is sketched with selective sensory anchors—damp stone, rust, ivy “like grasping fingers”—that double as moral commentary without overt symbolism. The loose floorboard and rosebush function as micro-setting objects that directly gate access and timing, constraining the final choice. Spatial choreography stays coherent across the two-character blocking. While wider town or auction space is off-page, the compressed scene doesn’t need more; environment does the job it was asked to do.

  * grade_story_wc_80.txt (grade=8.7)
    Submerged pavilion, silt-filled boots, shifting keystone stones are tactile and filter through surveyor’s professional eye. The antique inkwell acts as micro-setting that constrains the final act once it runs dry. Cold air, groaning gears, water seepage all serve the stakes of access vs. abandonment. Spatial choreography clean: body, satchel, bricks, river tracked without drift.

  * grade_story_wc_81.txt (grade=8.1)
    Submerged library filters lantern-light into shifting “dappled” patterns that mirror Elias’s wavering certainty; salt-slick bindings and warped ledger tactically slow page-turns, buying discovery time. Micro-setting (stamp in palm) closes the story with charged poise. One-line weather cue (“blackout ended”) is external and un-integrated, a minor drop.

  * grade_story_wc_82.txt (grade=8.9)
    Floating tea garden, inverted bonsai, silver chains, and glass basilica are filtered through Veyra’s artisan eye; every detail either enables access (chains as ladder) or mirrors grief (cranes caught in roots). The dream-pools’ liquid-silver texture returns in the serpent-coil of light that finally seizes her, charging the closure image. Spatial choreography is immaculate: we track her climb, palm-press, and workshop return without drift. The environment literally constrains the final choice—she can’t flee the platform—meeting the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_83.txt (grade=8.6)
    The floating observatory’s groaning metal, fractured dome-glass, and hissing breakers constrain every move—Lena times her crawl to the cooling cycle, and the final dash is forced by the reboot’s red flash. Body-as-setting works too: the charred lace clings like memory, and the geode’s rising fever tracks escalation. Selective sensory triage—heat on soles, drone-hum in bone—keeps crisis filtration tight. Environment is not backdrop; it literally times the climax and brands her skin, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_84.txt (grade=7.8)
    Observatory dome, brass teeth, ozone, parchment—selective sensory triangulation that mirrors Elias’s wired alertness. The drone’s feed and the chip’s warmth give tactile anchors that evolve across beats. Environment never blocks or enables choice, so it stays atmospheric rather than tactical, but specificity is character-filtered and consistent.

  * grade_story_wc_85.txt (grade=8.4)
    Cobalt terrace light, tide-carved “ghost fingers,” and the pocket-watch’s brass each filter through Elias’s professional eye for faked patina; driftwood symbol constrains the search and charges the final image. Micro-setting (watch casing, splintered wood) doubles as pressure tool. One minor slip: shoreline geography sketched only after beat begins, but spatial choreography remains clean.

  * grade_story_wc_86.txt (grade=8.7)
    The parapet’s slick stones and blade-like crescent moon constrain ambush options and time the encounter; the drawer-pull’s worn brass is returned to twice, finally pressing against Elias’s thigh to charge the parting image. Sensory selection narrows to cold, weight, and salt, mirroring Elias’s pared-down emotional range. Spatial choreography is immaculate: step-forward / step-back tracks cleanly, no drift.

  * grade_story_wc_87.txt (grade=7.9)
    Salt-spray, wobble of hull, and brass worn smooth anchor body and tool; the utility poles function as micro-setting that constrains his gaze and later choice. Weather shift (clouds → sun) is timed to the beat of release, not mere backdrop. Island rocks as “broken teeth” edge toward stock, but spatial choreography stays coherent.

  * grade_story_wc_88.txt (grade=8.1)
    Bioluminescent lake, damp tunnels, and mirror chamber are filtered through Elias’s guarded perception; the glowing water and mirrored memories constrain his choices—step closer, look away, keep walking. Selective sensory detail (water lapping at boots, baseball warming) integrates with action rather than pausing for catalog. The lake’s glow charging the final image satisfies the 9+ gate, though spatial choreography in the tunnel fork is lightly sketched.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=8.6)
    The orchard is never a postcard: branches “heavy with fruit that glowed like embers” supply both light source and hazard, while cinnamon-clove scent is the active medium of conjuration. Spatial choreography stays clean—she crouches, grinds, palms flare, bird perches—so bodies and distances track. The permanent moonlight and silver wind function as environmental constraints that make the resurrection ritual plausible inside this pocket world. One minor overdraft: “silver moon that never set” is told once but never exploited for time pressure or tidal eeriness, so its rule remains under-leveraged.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=8.3)
    Silvered grass, ozone, crushed-violet air, and the porcelain fracture’s warmth form a tactile micro-setting that guides her tracing finger; the saucer’s temperature shift charges the final image. Spatial choreography remains coherent within the single cloud-rooted glade.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=8.7)
    The ship’s hull, algae glow, and curling photographs are tactile, selective, and filtered through Liora’s grief-attuned gaze. The micro-setting of the locket-against-photograph becomes the final constraint that triggers the dimensional gash. Gravity loosening is sensed through her bare feet no longer touching, marrying body to environment. One minor over-tell: “floating reliquary of human regret” abstracts what the corridor images already show.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=8.0)
    Black sand, lava glow, and bug-light create a tactile micro-setting that constrains the final run—bare feet on hot grit, dying glow signaling time.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=8.0)
    Rusted ribs of the library, coffee-tin weight in the coat, and mildew air are filtered through Lumen’s tactile sorting; the skeletal metal frame literally cages then releases him, charging the final image without ornamental detail.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=8.6)
    The arbor’s swaying mast-thick branches and bioluminescent moss are not backdrop; they supply the literal stage, the salt spray that wets the keys, and the rising tide that answers the music. The broken clock on the piano constrains timing and is handled in-scene across multiple beats, charging the final image when it ticks again.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=8.6)
    The ridge is not backdrop: the bioluminescent blossoms narrow Liora’s attention, mirror her pulse, and later light her descent; the seed’s glyphs shift under touch, forcing her decision. Spatial choreography is flawless—crouch, palm-press, wrist-curl. Weather is imminent, not decorative; the three-day clock alters tactics. Micro-setting (seed-as-bracelet) constrains her future movement, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=7.8)
    Salt-air pine, frayed hat brim, and rain-drip cadence are filtered through Elias’s tactile attention; the antique lace’s stitches function as micro-setting that constrains his finger-movement choices. The compass’s cold hum and the maple’s wet leaf give sensory hierarchy, but environment never actively blocks or endangers him—setting informs, doesn’t test. Final image of thread catching light reprises the islet’s shimmer, so atmosphere charges closure.

  * grade_story_wc_0.txt (grade=9.3)
    The storm-damaged greenhouse functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: cracked glass limits light, washed soil negates growth, damp warps tools. Every sensory detail (groaning glass, grit under glove, warped pages) serves Elara’s shift from astrophysics to forensic botany. The butterfly dust—handled repeatedly—charges the final image as both scientific specimen and poetic residue. Environment doesn’t mirror but *mediates* her epiphany.

  * grade_story_wc_1.txt (grade=8.9)
    The canyon isn’t backdrop—it actively guides via frost patterns that mirror ledger routes, turning environment into a decipherable map. Beads, kiln ruins, creek stones are filtered through Liora’s artist-perception (“shaping light into vessels”), making setting an extension of her psyche. Final image ties frost, stars, and ledger into a charged micro-setting that constrains her next move: upstream, toward danger.

  * grade_story_wc_10.txt (grade=9.3)
    Winterglass isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes the climax: its frost patterns mirror frozen sound, its cold conducts vibration, and its pane becomes the instrument Elias strikes. The tuning fork case and heat-mapper are micro-settings that constrain tactics (only visual feedback available). Sensory hierarchy narrows appropriately: Elias notices temperature shifts, light refractions, tactile vibrations—not irrelevant sounds. Final image charges the dome as “frozen leviathan” now resonant with color-music.

  * grade_story_wc_100.txt (grade=9.3)
    The broken lens functions as micro-setting—its weight, coldness, and fractured rainbows constrain the undertaker’s choices and charge the climax. The underwater library is not backdrop but active crucible: stained glass glows “as if lit from within,” shelves pulse with city-bones, and water parts only because he occupies “impossible spaces.” Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—lantern light fractures early; later, scent of “old paper and salt” dominates calmer immersion. Final glow “seeping into forgotten places” ties environment directly to thematic closure.

  * grade_story_wc_101.txt (grade=9.0)
    The terra-cotta arbor functions as micro-setting: it anchors spatial choreography, supplies the central table for the bell, and frames every key interaction. Its warmth, curvature, and history constrain Liora’s choices—she returns here nightly, tells stories here, places offerings here. The ridge’s wind and twilight modulate tone and perception, never generic. Final image of the bells glowing “like a captured star” charges the setting with thematic resonance tied directly to closure.

  * grade_story_wc_102.txt (grade=8.9)
    The viaduct, wisteria, fog, and camera obscura form a micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice: the device reflects inner truth, fog responds to breath, and the blooming bridge frames spiritual liminality. Sensory detail is selective (violet wisteria, cold metal, damp stones) and filtered through Lien’s spiritually attuned perception. The setting culminates in the final image—fog parting as love is given—making environment inseparable from theme.

  * grade_story_wc_103.txt (grade=9.1)
    The living bridge garden isn’t backdrop—it actively pressures choice: hedges guide Elara, roots form doorways, leaves “quake with reverie” post-resolution. The halo fragment functions as micro-setting, constraining tactics (it must be pressed to the photo/mother) and charging the final image (its absence signifies irreversible exchange). Sensory detail is selective and urgent—damp air, scorched paper edges, warm pulse—filtered through Elara’s time-attuned perception. The gaslit street echoes the garden’s rules, proving setting as causal agent.

  * grade_story_wc_104.txt (grade=9.1)
    The carnival’s decay isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains: rusted rides block paths, the prize counter hides them, the warped piano bench houses the key-map. Sensory details (stale popcorn, humidity-warped wood) are filtered through Mira’s urgency, never catalogued. The final image of dawn over dry soil gains charge because the setting’s infertility was established through concrete absence (“given up on green things”). Environment directly shapes tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_105.txt (grade=9.1)
    The sunken greenhouse, shipwrecks, and ashen forge aren’t backdrop—they constrain choice and charge closure. Elias’s body (scarred fingers, dying cells) functions as micro-setting, shaping how he handles tools and time. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: early visual dominance (aurora colors) gives way to tactile heat (forge) and auditory memory (sea groans). Final image ties environment to theme: molten foil under aurora light becomes both tool and testament.

  * grade_story_wc_106.txt (grade=8.9)
    The emerald station functions as micro-setting: its tiles shimmer like dreams, its clock trembles, and golden-hour light pressures decisions. The jar and rose are tactile extensions of environment that constrain choice—Lira’s satchel hides stolen light; Kael’s bouquet communicates in code. Sensory detail is purposeful (glowing windows, lavender scent) and filtered through Lira’s poetic perception. The station doesn’t just backdrop—it actively mirrors the thematic shift from isolation to connection.

  * grade_story_wc_107.txt (grade=8.9)
    The abandoned control room functions as a micro-setting that constrains and charges choice—its dormant dials, flickering bulbs, and dusty switches directly enable Elias’s ritual of narration and calibration. The cracked bookmark and melting ice are tactile extensions of setting, woven into action and perception. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (e.g., “hummed like dying bees,” “frayed edges whispering”). Final image of machines whirring like “old ghosts” ties environment to closure with irreplaceable specificity.

  * grade_story_wc_108.txt (grade=9.3)
    The rusted library functions as micro-setting: iron shelves “groaning like a shipwrecked hull” mirror Mira’s fractured identity, while the rotting floorboards physically conceal truth. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—damp paper, starlight, the lantern’s swing—all filtered through Mira’s stunt-double hyper-awareness of space and danger. Crucially, the setting constrains choice: the loose floorboard is accessible only because she uses the cast as a tool. The final image of stars “burning brighter” reweights the environment as witness, not backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_109.txt (grade=9.0)
    Setting functions as micro-setting: the ridge fort’s cold stones, shattered roof, and groaning timbers directly shape the oracle’s posture, perception, and ritual. Pebbles recur with evolving meaning—from mute stories to echoes—and charge the final image when the tide takes the last gold leaf. Weather (storm, stillness, returning wind) mirrors internal transformation without cliché. The “marbled blue” sky at end reconfigures the opening storm, proving environment constrains and reflects choice.

  * grade_story_wc_11.txt (grade=9.3)
    The frozen courtyard isn’t backdrop—it’s micro-setting that constrains choice: ice melts at warmth, yet E-7X, a heat-emitting machine, risks contact. Twilight’s dimness mirrors cognitive liminality; frost pedestal and shattered-mirror ice reflect his fractured mind. Final image of sweeping frost ties setting to purpose—environment charges closure. Sensory balance (hum, chill, crack) avoids visual dominance.

  * grade_story_wc_110.txt (grade=8.7)
    The crystal forecourt and projector lens function as micro-settings that charge the closure—the forecourt’s hum softens post-honesty, the lens becomes a “promise.” Sensory detail (scent of celluloid, slick cobblestones) is selective and POV-filtered, never touristy. Spatial choreography remains coherent throughout. However, the setting doesn’t actively constrain choices beyond mood; it reflects rather than pressures, preventing a 9+ score under the gate rule.

  * grade_story_wc_111.txt (grade=9.1)
    The garden maze functions as a dynamic micro-setting that constrains and responds: roots rise overnight, paths shift, hedges part. Its decay mirrors Elias’s body (“brittle as old parchment,” “knees popping like dry twigs”), and the metallic seedling charges the final image with irreplaceable specificity. Every sensory detail—clinking marbles, silver-river cracks, dried-blood petals—is filtered through Elias’s vine-dresser perception, never touristy or static.

  * grade_story_wc_112.txt (grade=8.9)
    The xenobiology station functions as micro-setting: its organic-metal hybridity (“mechanically warm,” “bioluminescent algae”) constrains Elara’s actions and charges the final image (abandoned future). Sensory detail is purposeful—thermal regulators, wing hums, fogged glass—all filtered through her mechanic’s POV. The recurring bioluminescent motif evolves from ambient pulse to overgrown vine, reweighting the closure. Deduct 0.1 for slight overreliance on visual description in the climax.

  * grade_story_wc_113.txt (grade=9.1)
    The flooded opera house isn’t backdrop—it actively shapes every choice: water reveals images, submerges the pit, floats the violin, and triggers the transition to the “in-between.” The lanterns’ flicker mirrors narrative tension, and the decaying architecture embodies time’s weight. Crucially, the setting constrains the climax: only by entering the water can Lena access Elias’s violin and the symphony. The micro-setting (water surface as mirror/medium) charges the final image when it stills post-performance.

  * grade_story_wc_114.txt (grade=8.7)
    The mountain station functions as micro-setting: its isolation enables the oracle’s exile, and the observation deck frames the valley “like a bruise,” mirroring his guilt. Weather (“auroral sorrow of dawn”) modulates tone without cliché. However, the environment doesn’t actively constrain choices—the descent feels inevitable, not shaped by terrain. Still, the final image of dawn light on peaks charges closure with earned warmth.

    Setting is masterfully specific: wet concrete, broken glass, rusted nails—all filter through Elias’s tactile exploration. The beaded valve wheel and train tunnel function as micro-settings that constrain choice (he follows the clank into the tunnel) and charge the final image (wheel reinstalled, silence ensues). Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress—sound dominates in climax—and avoids white-room syndrome with precise spatial choreography. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_116.txt (grade=9.3)
    The obsidian refuge functions as micro-setting that constrains choice—it’s the only place where reality is malleable, enabling her final act of release. Library catacombs and river aren’t backdrop but active textures: stone shelves shift, water laps at pages, silence regenerates. Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered (she notices temperature shifts, decay scents, light on black stone). The environment charges the closure: placing the book at the water’s edge is only possible because of this specific refuge’s properties.

  * grade_story_wc_117.txt (grade=8.6)
    Sage Ridge functions as micro-setting: the creek, oak, and meadow aren’t backdrop but active participants—the creek “answers,” trees “lean in,” and the eclipse site channels collective awe. The recurring curl and instruments constrain emotional expression and charge the closure. However, geographic specificity beyond mood (“mountains cradled the valley”) lacks tactile uniqueness that would push into 9+ territory.

  * grade_story_wc_118.txt (grade=9.1)
    The silo functions as both setting and micro-setting: its concrete ribs, spiraling shelves, and deep thrum directly constrain Elara’s actions and charge the climax. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—smell of wheat and rust, dim light on crimson threads—and filtered through her historian’s attention. The environment culminates in the final image: the silo groans, shelves tilt, and the tapestry becomes a door. Every atmospheric element tightens around the central mystery without stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_119.txt (grade=9.0)
    The lighthouse isn’t backdrop—it’s a functional micro-setting that constrains and enables choice: the Fresnel lens bends light to reveal the hidden envelope, directly shaping tactics.

The nautilus shell functions as micro-setting—its spiral “map” and rainbows on glass directly charge closure. Sensory hierarchy narrows to touch (cold pane, warm shell) and sound (silence humming), avoiding tourist cataloguing. Environment irreplaceably shapes the final stance: without this spire-lake-shell triad, the crack in the mirror vanishes.

  * grade_story_wc_121.txt (grade=8.9)
    The glowing viaduct isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: its unstable stones trigger the inciting float, its hum echoes fractured identity, and its dissolution initiates the labyrinth. Rain, ozone, and mud recur to charge the ending, where the dimming glow mirrors Elias’s relinquishment. Spatial choreography stays tight (cliffs, mud, door), and the body functions as setting during weightless suspension. Only misses 9+ by not constraining a tactical choice beyond the initial fall.

  * grade_story_wc_122.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cavern isn’t backdrop but micro-setting: its sound-absorbing walls constrain communication (forcing touch and vibration), shape pedagogy (Elias teaches rhythm through bone conduction), and charge the climax—the drum’s inaudible thrum only works because the space swallows echo. The broken needle, drum skin, and lantern light are purposefully selected, filtered through Elias’s tactile memory and Mira’s desperate need for texture. Sensory hierarchy favors vibration over sound, aligning with POV; the “filament of hush” emerges from environment-body-tool fusion. Final image ties cavern acoustics to emotional transformation, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_123.txt (grade=9.3)
    The courtyard functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges the final image: its stillness contrasts the mechanical rhythm Elias detects, and its rainwater reflects stars just before he chooses action.

    The terrace isn’t backdrop—it’s active micro-setting: slick stone enables rainbow refractions; the prism parapet scatters light into the very colors Liora steals for her paint; the echoing stone vibrates with ancestral memory. Rain, jasmine, and dying light aren’t decorative—they filter perception, signal the liminal hour, and constrain the painting act to this precise atmospheric window. The setting directly charges the closure: without the rain-slicked prism at dusk, the mirage wouldn’t pulse, the colors wouldn’t bleed, and the borrowed heartbeat wouldn’t find its rhythm. Every sensory detail serves pressure or choice.

  * grade_story_wc_171.txt (grade=8.9)
    The terrace functions as micro-setting: its ritual significance constrains choice (they must meet here), and its worn stone echoes thematic weight. The ebony clipboard and jasmine-scented air are tactile, selective, and filtered through Liora’s war-weariness. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—the monks’ chant rising “like smoke” ties atmosphere to closure. Only minor deduction: midsummer heat doesn’t actively alter tactics beyond mood.

  * grade_story_wc_172.txt (grade=9.1)
    The salt flat functions as micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice: its crystalline crust mirrors the egg’s fragility, its artificial expansion reflects Elias’s warped preservationism, and its dissolution becomes the vehicle of redemption. Sensory detail is selective and purposeful—“sickly light of the moon,” “warm” egg, “distant thunder”—all filtered through Elias’s sentimental gaze. The environment directly shapes the climax: only here, at the convergence of cracks, can the map be read and the release enacted. Final image ties setting to theme without overt symbolism.

  * grade_story_wc_173.txt (grade=8.9)
    The silver courtyard and prism sanctuary function as active micro-settings: snow imprints track agency, starlight fractures meaning, and cold physically shapes Liora’s barefoot vulnerability. The environment constrains choice (bare feet on snow) and charges the final image (courtyard as mirror). However, while vivid, the setting doesn’t *alter* tactics beyond atmosphere—thus missing the 9+ gate requiring constraint on action.

  * grade_story_wc_174.txt (grade=9.3)
    The decommissioned radar dome functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its sound-swallowing curvature enables Liora’s ritual, while rust, salt wind, and broken machinery constrain mood and action.

The feather and stone charge the final image—their textures directly enable and resolve the quest. Setting evolves causally with Elias’s descent, never static.

  * grade_story_wc_225.txt (grade=9.1)
    Harkensleep isn’t backdrop—it’s an active crucible. The “woven hush” suppresses sound and motion, forcing Elias inward; the frost-dusted cobblestones mirror his emotional stasis. The platinum labyrinth and tapestry function as micro-settings that constrain choice: only tactile engagement with threads unlocks memory. The final mirror-door emerges organically from these objects, charging the closure with environmental logic.

  * grade_story_wc_226.txt (grade=9.4)
    The bone towers, canyon echoes, and pale spire aren’t backdrop—they constrain and catalyze. The towers amplify sound into ghost-chorus, forcing Lira’s voice into public ritual; the spire’s mist obscures until her truth clears it. Every sensory detail (ivory curves, pulsing shard, mist curling like a living thing) serves pressure or closure. The setting *is* the conflict—forgiveness made geography—and culminates in the spire etched with her words, irreplaceable and charged.

  * grade_story_wc_227.txt (grade=9.3)
    The workshop-as-body micro-setting constrains every choice: acid sea threatens dissolution, gears dictate rhythm, rusted struts limit movement. Crucially, the setting charges the final image—the statue’s stone skin splitting as liquid gold flows mirrors Elias’s internal mending. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis: fumes burn lungs, metal bites palms, silence amplifies creaks. Environment isn’t backdrop but active participant in the kintsugi logic.

  * grade_story_wc_228.txt (grade=9.0)
    The coastal caves function as more than backdrop—they constrain choice (wrong turn, submerged ledge) and charge the final image (bioluminescent veins reflected in still water become the canvas). The painted seashell, phosphorescent algae, and narrow dry tunnel are purpose-driven details filtered through Elias’s nostalgic perception. The setting evolves causally: damp stone → hidden oasis → submerged tunnel → painted walls. Crucially, the environment directly enables the climax—without the ledge, there is no tunnel; without the tunnel, no revelation.

  * grade_story_wc_229.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cobalt lighthouse isn’t backdrop—it’s micro-setting that constrains and charges every choice: glass transmits vibration, cliffs enable the drop, dawn light refracts meaning. Sensory detail is purposeful (salt-chipped paint, damp-earth scent) and filtered through Elias’s obsession with resonance. Weather evolves causally (heat wave → storm → rain) and directly alters tactics (waiting for harder rain).

Final image charges setting: roots that “held you, even when they hurt” fuse environment and theme. Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through trauma—no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_231.txt (grade=9.0)
    The opal dock, mist, and lighthouse beam aren’t backdrop—they’re active constraints that shape perception and mood. The dock’s isolation enables the stranger’s silent arrival and Elias’s undisturbed observation; the mist blurs reality, allowing borrowed memories to seep in. Crucially, the setting charges the closure: the lighthouse beam’s sweep illuminates the boutonnière at the end, tying environment to thematic resolution. Sensory detail is selective, POV-filtered, and never stalls momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_232.txt (grade=9.3)
    Setting functions as active constraint and symbolic microcosm: the shop’s dusty maps, the rising creek, the blooming cavern—all pressure Elias’s choice. The bioluminescent blossoms and shifting door patterns charge the final image without overt symbolism. Crucially, the type foundry chip (a tool-as-setting) constrains the climax—it must fit, and it does. Every environmental detail filters through Elias’s cartographer-antiquarian POV, grounding specificity in character.

  * grade_story_wc_233.txt (grade=9.1)
    The cobalt grotto isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and charges: its moss slickness slows descent, its silver mirror redefines reality, its ceiling void swallows the queen’s former self. Sensory detail is selective and urgent—ozone smell, damp earth, firefly gold—filtered through the queen’s awe and exhaustion. The body itself becomes setting: constellations pulse on her skin like living maps. Final image ties environment to rebirth: dawn creeps as she steps out, no longer marked but remade.

  * grade_story_wc_234.txt (grade=9.0)
    The ember nexus functions as a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges choices: its twilight light enables alchemy, its ash hides the curl, and its humming air signals liminality. The nautilus shell and vial of twilight are tactile objects that evolve from passive relics to active tools in the climax. Sensory details are filtered through Liora’s alchemical profession—she sees light as “molten copper,” smells “charred cedar and ozone”—making perception character-specific. The final image of flaring embers directly reconfigures the setting’s meaning from decay to potential.

  * grade_story_wc_235.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mountain ranger cabin isn’t backdrop—it’s an active constraint: its creaks mirror Elias’s psyche, its loft hides the scroll, its isolation enables the haunting. The recurring object (birch bark scroll) charges the final image as Elias clutches it before the door opens. Sensory detail (iron and pine taste, wind howling “like a thing alive”) is selective, urgent, and filtered through Elias’s dread. Crucially, the setting forecloses escape, making the confrontation inevitable.

  * grade_story_wc_236.txt (grade=9.1)
    The water clock repair shop functions as micro-setting: its fogged windows, ticking clepsydra, and tactile tools constrain and charge every choice.

Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis (cool moss, crystalline ink shards) without cliché.

  * grade_story_wc_238.txt (grade=9.1)
    The archive functions as micro-setting: stone damp, yellowed scores, and stained glass constrain and charge every move. The perfume bottle—a recurring object—shapes tactics (wound with wire) and crystallizes the ending. Sensory hierarchy reflects Elias’s trauma: smell over sight, silence over sound. Final dawn light (“gold and blood”) reconfigures the space thematically and emotionally.

  * grade_story_wc_239.txt (grade=9.3)
    The temple library functions as a charged micro-setting: its shelves “like ribs of a forgotten god” and the arbitration stone directly constrain Elara’s choices and enable her journey. The dictionary-as-tool and the stone’s light extinction alter tactics meaningfully. Final image—void threads knitted by memory—recharges the library’s architecture as cosmic loom. Sensory detail is selective, tactile, and POV-filtered (“dust motes… each particle a syllable”), avoiding white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_24.txt (grade=9.3)
    The station functions as micro-setting that actively constrains choice: its groaning girders, gas lamp, and hydraulic pipes shape Elias’s perception and tactics. The razor-edged clock hands and mantle key are tools that charge the climax. Sensory detail is selective and pressure-driven—ozone scent signals anomaly, fogged glass demands wiping—and the fjord’s quiet modulates with cosmic tension. Final image of “steady” horizon gains weight because setting was never backdrop but active participant.

  * grade_story_wc_240.txt (grade=9.3)
    The bioluminescent farm isn’t backdrop—it’s active crucible. Light pulses like a heartbeat, roots snake through rock, damp earth yields under boots: every detail constrains perception and choice. The laser beam only works because of the humidity and darkness; the spore’s descent matters because of the glow. Most crucially, the setting charges the closure—the entire farm pulsing in unison makes the thematic shift visceral. This micro-setting functions as both environment and character, fully integrated into the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_241.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rainwashed library isn’t backdrop—it constrains choice (slick steps, humming servers, mildew air) and charges closure via the mica-pane lantern, whose fractured light evolves from ambiance to key to instrument of revelation. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency: wet parchment early, then ink-stained fingers, then searing white-hot flame. The recurring object (lantern) directly enables the climax and reconfigures meaning at the end.

  * grade_story_wc_242.txt (grade=9.0)
    The utility tunnel isn’t backdrop—it’s a kingdom that shapes Mara’s identity and limits her interactions.

The stepping stone functions as micro-setting: its chipped patterns guide her fingers and force confrontation with Amira’s legacy. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis (focus on touch, dim light, scent of ash), and spatial choreography remains coherent. The plaza evolves from ruin to Courtyard of the Unbroken Name through embodied interaction, not declaration.

  * grade_story_wc_280.txt (grade=9.0)
    The mystic orchard isn’t backdrop but active crucible: its seasonal shifts respond to Elias’s ritual, and the hedge maze’s concealment enables secrecy essential to the plot. Sensory detail (scent of apples, taste of lightning, creaking gate) is filtered through Elias’s synesthesia, avoiding generic description. The setting constrains choice—only here, after hours, can magic occur—and charges the final image as trees flicker between seasons during Liora’s decision.

  * grade_story_wc_281.txt (grade=9.0)
    The light painting studio isn’t backdrop but active constraint: blacklight reveals phosphorescent pathways, enabling Mara’s somatic mapping. Body-as-setting dominates—paint on skin, sternum impact, geode in pocket—all charge the final image. Sensory detail (ozone, burnt sugar, willowglass hope) filters through Mara’s scientific-poetic bias without tourist cataloging. The muscovite’s refractions directly mirror neural fractals, making object and environment co-conspirators in revelation.

Sensory detail is selective and POV-filtered: he notices paper smell because he’s a poet; glass clouded by salt because he seeks vessels for sound. The music box and jars function as object-as-setting, constraining his actions and charging the climax. Final image gains resonance because the loft’s silence is now populated by ghostly choruses—a direct environmental transformation.

  * grade_story_wc_390.txt (grade=9.3)
    The drift-ice marina isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains choice: creaking piers limit movement, unstable ice threatens collapse, and the lighthouse’s sonic beam is both tool and environmental feature. The golden sunset tightens the temporal window, charging every decision. Final image (“breath no longer a ghost”) ties atmosphere to interior transformation. Every sensory detail serves pressure or character perception.

  * grade_story_wc_391.txt (grade=9.3)
    The basalt sanctuary, frozen lake, and magnetic viaduct form a micro-setting that actively constrains and charges every beat—the ice’s deceptive thinness mirrors political fragility, the viaduct’s hum signals change, and the cold shapes behavior. Sensory detail is selective, embodied, and POV-filtered (Elias notices moon paths, stone cracks, metallic groans). The environment directly enables the closure: the glowing ice under moonlight becomes the visual anchor of the revolution’s quiet arrival.

  * grade_story_wc_392.txt (grade=8.9)
    The subway tunnel isn’t backdrop—it pressures choices: flickering lights force reliance on the lantern; spatial choreography (pipes hiding the door) enables discovery. The lantern functions as micro-setting, constraining tactics (its concealment, warmth, flare). Sensory details (damp concrete, ozone) reflect Elias’s professional attention and emotional state without tourist cataloging. Final image charges the lantern’s recurrence: its flame now signifies active resistance, not just heritage.

  * grade_story_wc_393.txt (grade=9.0)
    The antique shop functions as micro-setting: its atmosphere (“aged wood and lemon oil”) mirrors Elias’s moral decay, and Kael’s workbench becomes the crucible where truth is examined. The clockwork heart itself acts as constrained tool—its physical presence and ticking drive the plot and charge the final image. Rain slicing “like a blade” externalizes internal rupture, while light through storm clouds visually echoes the story’s core tension between obscurity and revelation. Every sensory detail serves pressure or closure.

  * grade_story_wc_394.txt (grade=9.3)
    The acid-sea workshop isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains choice (rising fumes force urgency) and charges closure (its groan becomes the bell’s voice). Recurring objects function as micro-setting: arrow tip scrapes metal during final adjustment; copper bell etched with transliterated symbols. Sensory hierarchy reflects crisis—Elias notices fumes, groans, vibrations over visual detail. Every environmental element tightens stakes or echoes theme without static description.

  * grade_story_wc_395.txt (grade=8.9)
    The archive functions as a charged micro-setting: its “quiet static” and “labyrinth of server logs” aren’t backdrop but active constraints shaping Lena’s search tactics. The patch—a tactile object—recurs with evolving meaning, culminating in its symbolic fusion with the transfer log. Sensory detail is selective (grainy footage, frayed fabric) and filtered through Lena’s urgency. The final image (“archive was a battleground”) reweights the setting conceptually, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_396.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lighthouse orchard above shifting ice floes is vividly rendered and actively constrains choice: the path through the trees only appears after mirror interaction, and the ice’s movement signals threat. Sensory detail (salt, old paper, frost-laced branches) is selective and POV-filtered. The setting charges the final image—the lighthouse beam warming Elias post-victory—fulfilling the 9+ gate. Minor deduction: the “vintage store mirrors” feel slightly anachronistic but not disruptive.

  * grade_story_wc_397.txt (grade=9.0)
    The drift-ice marina isn’t backdrop—it groans, shifts, and dictates movement, constraining choice (e.g., stilts forcing cautious steps). The parasol tip functions as micro-setting: its warmth and fragility charge the final exchange. Sensory detail (wet wool, antiseptic, thawing ice) filters through Elias’s altered perception, never touristy. Final image of pale sun on groaning ice reconfigures environment as witness, not stage.

  * grade_story_wc_398.txt (grade=8.9)
    The amber pavilion functions as micro-setting: its creaking seams and golden canvas mirror emotional fragility and hope, directly charging the final image. Autumn vineyard details are selective and tactile—damp earth, mist-curling hills, plump grapes—filtered through Liora’s sentinel POV.

Only minor deduction: the pavilion’s physical layout could be slightly clearer during the reunion.

  * grade_story_wc_399.txt (grade=9.1)
    The murmuring pavilion, kinetic parapet, and conjured clearing aren’t backdrop—they constrain action. The pavilion’s whispers demand peripheral awareness; the parapet’s pulse guides the walker’s palm; the clearing’s silence enables the thread’s revelation. Each setting element charges the final image: the mask flares only within the clearing, tying environment to epiphany. Sensory hierarchy reflects urgency—sound fades as touch intensifies—avoiding tourist cataloguing.

  * grade_story_wc_4.txt (grade=8.9)
    The lavender field and factory ruins are vividly rendered and function as more than backdrop—they shape Elias’s ritual and aesthetic. Light, vines, and rust interact dynamically with memory and time. The setting charges the closure: dawn light transforms decay into beauty, echoing the thematic shift. However, while atmosphere is masterful, the environment doesn’t actively constrain a choice—it enables reflection but doesn’t force a tactical pivot, keeping it just shy of 9+.

  * grade_story_wc_40.txt (grade=9.3)
    The library functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its shadows, light beams, and timbers actively respond to sound, constraining and enabling Elias’s experiments.

Sensory detail is selective, urgent, and filtered through Elias’s technician POV.

  * grade_story_wc_43.txt (grade=8.4)
    The “radiant haven” is vividly rendered through frosted glass, golden diffusion, and scent—but it remains largely atmospheric rather than constraining choice. The micro-setting of the guitar and vinyl shards functions more effectively: the instrument enables the hymn; the shards charge the closure. Sensory hierarchy aligns with POV—Elias notices scent, texture, sound—but the room itself doesn’t pressure decisions. Strong specificity, yet falls just short of 9+ gate because environment doesn’t actively shape tactics.

  * grade_story_wc_44.txt (grade=9.0)
    The floating isle, nocturnal observatory, and mirror-lined chamber aren’t backdrop—they constrain choice and charge closure. The key fits only the dais; mirrors reflect lost moments, not images; ozone-scented air signals latent energy.

Mist swallows lies; wind shapes dialogue rhythm; sea claims “everything eventually,” echoing Elias’s burden. Crucially, the setting charges the final image: dawn paints mist gold-gray as they retreat, the empty parapet holding the weight of what was exchanged and withheld. Every sensory detail (slick stone, salt, brass tarnish) serves pressure or theme.

    The coastal launch, kayak, and island function as micro-settings that constrain choice: the wobbling hull forces balance, the island pulls him off-course, the rocks provide the stage for renunciation. The astronomical compass and utility poles are object-as-setting, charging the final image. Sensory detail is selective and pressure-driven—salt stings eyes during reflection, spray interrupts despair—never decorative. The environment actively shapes tactics and closure.

    The bioluminescent lake isn’t backdrop—it pulses, intensifies, and guides movement; its glow literally illuminates memory-mirrors. The underground tunnels’ dampness clings like Elias’s past, and the shifting labyrinth walls feel alive. Crucially, the setting constrains choice: Elias follows the lake’s light, and the mirrors only activate within its charged chamber. The baseball’s warmth against his skin ties object to environment, charging the final image.

  * grade_story_wc_89.txt (grade=9.1)
    The fairy-tale orchard isn’t backdrop—it actively enables and pressures: glowing fruit provides light, roots offer concealment, bark scent triggers memory, and branches “lean in” as witnesses. Crucially, the setting constrains the climax—spices must be gathered from this soil, under this moon, making the phoenix’s rebirth spatially inevitable. Final image of swaying branches “like dancers” charges closure with approval, tying environment to emotional resolution.

  * grade_story_wc_9.txt (grade=9.3)
    The “midnight glade above the clouds” isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and charges the closure: trees rooted in cumulus whisper secrets, grass silvered by starlight frames her ritual, and the clouds part “as if yielding to her sorrow.” The saucer (micro-setting) directly enables her epiphany; its crack guides memory and action. Sensory detail is purposeful (ozone + crushed violets) and filtered through her grief-stricken perception. Final image—ink meeting cloth where crack meets sky—is inseparable from setting, satisfying the 9+ gate.

  * grade_story_wc_90.txt (grade=9.1)
    The recycled spaceship functions as micro-setting: its patched hull, photo-papered walls, and dying engine directly constrain Liora’s stitching ritual. Bioluminescent algae, crystallized tears, and gravity’s loosening tether atmosphere to emotional stakes. Final image—Liora floating amid dissolving metal and ghosts—charges the closure with irreplaceable specificity. Every detail filters through her pacifist, memory-haunted POV; no white-room syndrome.

  * grade_story_wc_91.txt (grade=9.0)
    The black sand, volcano, and celestial timing aren’t backdrop—they constrain and charge every choice. The jarred lightning bug (micro-setting) pulses faster near the water’s edge, then dies as the earth trembles, directly linking environment to emotional stakes. Final image of ash-painted sky reweights the opening hush into urgency. Sensory hierarchy narrows under stress: crunch of sand, flicker of light, hum of silence—all filtered through Elias’s exhausted perception.

  * grade_story_wc_92.txt (grade=9.0)
    The luminous fort isn’t backdrop—it actively constrains and enables. Bioluminescent moss provides just enough light for stealth; corridors are “known better than her own reflection”; the unlit torch becomes a tactical resource. The bronze quill holder’s weight and hidden compartment matter physically and symbolically. Final image charges setting: twilight glow at her back contrasts the city’s silence ahead, making environment inseparable from stakes.

  * grade_story_wc_93.txt (grade=9.0)
    The tidal bluff under aurora isn’t backdrop—it’s active constraint and resource. Sand, tide line, and light pool dictate rock placement; the aurora draws star dust like a lodestone. Body functions as micro-setting: Elias’s palm on damp earth, eels coiling wrists—tactile specificity charges the final image. Every environmental detail serves the ritual’s logic, never stalling momentum.

  * grade_story_wc_94.txt (grade=9.0)
    The stormlit observatory functions as both macro- and micro-setting: its glass lashed by “desperate fingers” mirrors Elias’s internal pressure, while the brass railing and darkroom timer constrain choice through tactile interaction. The setting charges the final image—the parted clouds revealing a single star—as counterpoint to the human-made map of scars. Weather affects perception (lightning enabling revelation) and action (isolation enabling vigil). Every detail serves theme or closure; no white-room syndrome or generic backdrop.

  * grade_story_wc_95.txt (grade=9.0)
    The glass atrium and brook aren’t backdrop but active constraints: the glass amplifies sound into psychological pressure, while the brook’s “countdown” rhythm tightens tension. The mechanical arm and needle card function as micro-settings—their tactile handling shapes tactics (aligning perforations with shadows). Crucially, the setting charges the final image: dissolving walls signal internal barriers falling, making environment inseparable from emotional reconfiguration.

  * grade_story_wc_96.txt (grade=9.0)
    The rusted library isn’t backdrop—it constrains and enables: its padlock demands the key, its shelves structure Lumen’s psyche, its decay mirrors civic neglect. Sensory detail is selective (mildew, creaking metal, fat moon) and filtered through poetic urgency. The coffee tin functions as micro-setting—its false bottom physically holds the past and unlocks the future. Final image of stars “burning brighter” charges closure by contrasting earlier urban dimness, proving environment shapes thematic resonance.

  * grade_story_wc_97.txt (grade=9.4)
    The tidal arbor isn’t backdrop—it’s an active constraint: its height isolates Elias, its root-system hides the film reel, its swaying syncs with ocean pulses that guide his music. The broken clock and bioluminescent moss directly charge the final image. Every sensory detail (salt-tinged mist, ink-dark waves) filters through Elias’s grief-saturated perception. No white-room syndrome; spatial choreography remains coherent even with multiple arrivals.

  * grade_story_wc_98.txt (grade=9.3)
    The ancient ridge isn’t backdrop—it’s active archive: blossoms pulse like heartbeats, seed sprouts into parchment, vines coil as bracelets. Every sensory detail (silver shimmer, sap-ink, thrumming air) serves Liora’s perception and stakes. The bioluminescent flora constrains her action (lighting her path only after commitment) and charges the final image. Weather (monsoon) is both deadline and character, fulfilling the 9+ gate by shaping tactics and closure.

  * grade_story_wc_99.txt (grade=9.1)
    The islet functions as micro-setting: rain-damp air, gnarled pines, and shore sand directly enable key actions (finding compass, kneeling, returning to cottage). The antique lace and bonsai are tactile extensions of setting that constrain choice—Elias must read stitches, align needle, follow threads. Final image (“scent of salt and possibility”) charges closure by transforming earlier “salt and damp earth” into hope. All sensory detail filtered through Elias’s bonsai-tutor perception—no tourist catalog.
